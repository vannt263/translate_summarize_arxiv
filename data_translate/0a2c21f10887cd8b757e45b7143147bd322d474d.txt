The Azawad National Liberation Movement -- known as the MNLA, the initials for its name in French -- is fighting for independence for the northern part of Mali, a region that it refers to as Azawad. The MNLA issued a statement about the violence, describing it as self-defense and resistance. The group claimed it took 30 prisoners, including 24 soldiers and three regional government officials. Two wounded Malian soldiers were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the MNLA added.
