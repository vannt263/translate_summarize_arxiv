  "news": "(CNN) -- Honduran President Porfirio \"Pepe\" Lobo has said that there are \"high up\" forces in his country that want him killed, but declined to give details. At an impromptu press conference at an event Monday, Lobo was asked by reporters why the presidential home was undergoing security upgrades, including the installation of a perimeter wall. \"It's unfortunate, but these safety measures must be taken, even more so when they are threatening me,\" Lobo said. \"They say that they shouldn't remove (me) because it's too problematic. Better to send someone to kill him.\" The president added that he knows \"who they are and they are not low down, they are high up.\" The threats stemmed from a new security tax that would be collected and used to fund police operations, Lobo said. The tax would collect about $78 million. The wall being built around the presidential home was being donated by the Taiwanese government, he said. Lobo assumed the presidency in 2010, the first leader elected after a 2009 coup that ousted former President Manuel Zelaya.",
