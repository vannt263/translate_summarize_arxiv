  "news": "(CNN) -- Hyundai is recalling more than 220,000 Santa Fe SUVs and Sonata sedans because of potential problems with their air bags. The recall affects almost 200,000 SUVs from the 2007-2009 model years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These vehicles' front passenger airbags may not deploy in the event of a crash because of a possible problem with their occupant classification system, which gauges the size of a passenger and based on that whether an air bag should be deployed. The system may need to be recalibrated to detect to \"small statured adults,\" the federal safety agency said. The company is also recalling more than 22,000 sedans from the 2012-2013 model years, according to the administration. These cars' curtain side airbags may inflate for no apparent reason because of a manufacturing error. Hyundai dealers are expected to notify owners and replace the curtain side airbags free of charge, the NHTSA said. Dealers will also update the classification software for free in the affected SUVs.",
