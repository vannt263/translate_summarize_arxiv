  "news": "Robert Knight, pictured, has been on the run for the past six years having fled Britain after police seized 6kg of cocaine at Heathrow Airport in April 2008 A wanted drug smuggler has been arrested in the middle of a game of poker in a swoop by armed police. Robert Knight, 53, from Walsall, was held in Saffy's sports bar in Calpe near Benidorm in southeast Spain last night after six years on the run. He was enjoying a game of Texas Hold'em poker when gun-wielding officers burst in and arrested him under a European Arrest Warrant. Knight, accused of a conspiracy to import cocaine, had previously been named on a most wanted list of British criminals who had fled to Spain. Hank Cole, Head of International Operations for the UK's National Crime Agency, said: 'Knight is believed to be a member of an organised crime group involved in the importation and distribution of illegal drugs. 'He had been on the run for a number of years but we were able to track him down. Spain is not a safe haven.' West Midlands Police seized six kilogrammes of cocaine at Heathrow Airport in April 2008 and arrested five men, who were later jailed, but had been looking for Knight ever since. Inspector Dave Simpson from the force said: 'I am delighted that Knight has been caught, it has been a long time coming. 'This just demonstrates that there is no hiding place for criminals and we will work with police forces from other countries along with the National Crime Agency to seek them out.' Knight is due to appear at the Spanish National Court in Madrid on Sunday where extradition proceedings will begin.
