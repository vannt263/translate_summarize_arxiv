  "article": "(Mashable)  -- Jules Verne, one of the pioneers of the science fiction literary genre, was born on this day, February 8, 1828. In honor of the writer who gave us the \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"A Journey to the Center of the Earth,\" Google has a special interactive logo today, letting you submerge a submarine deep below the water's surface and explore its depths, using the lever on the right. There's a couple of surprises there, including an obligatory treasure chest, scary sea monsters and some corals shaped in a way that resembles a certain logo. Happy exploring!
