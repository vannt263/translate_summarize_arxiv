Highlights include New York's NoMad, which houses a two-floor library that turns into a cocktail bar, and the Fasano Boa Vista, in Brazil -- a resort that has natural forest and lakes in its vast grounds. More from Wallpaper*: The new breed of designer hostels But this year's best business hotel is the Georges, a tiny boutique establishment in Istanbul's Galata district, which offers its pampered guests a private butler.
