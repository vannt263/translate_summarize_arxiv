    "the economy is a complex interacting system that responds to a multitude of influences and extends over a wide range of monetary scales . as experience with financial crises continues to demonstrate ,",
    "understanding how an economy develops and how it is influenced by externalities remains poorly understood .",
    "basic questions about what causes financial crises and how to deal with them continue to be hotly debated , with little sign that a fundamental understanding is emerging  @xcite .    what can statistical physics contribute to this discussion ? not much , if the goal is to predict the economy next year . however , statistical physics possesses powerful theoretical tools that have proven useful in describing specific financial phenomena , such as the black - scholes options pricing formula  @xcite .",
    "there are many parallels between statistical physics and economic phenomena , and physics - based modeling has helped facilitate conceptual developments in finance and economics ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in classic economic theories , humans , or companies ,",
    "are considered as rational actors that respond deterministically to external conditions .",
    "more recently , stochastic tools have been applied to the economy , particularly to financial modeling .",
    "the stochastic approaches that are conventionally employed are brownian motion and its generalizations . in physics",
    ", a similar approach was followed to describe non - deterministic systems , where the interaction between a particle and its environment was mimicked by noise , while interactions between microscopic entities ( such as brownian particles ) were ignored .",
    "this development ( associated with physicists like einstein , langevin , and stratonovich , and mathematicians like kolmogorov , feller , and it ) led to increasingly sophisticated stochastic processes @xcite , a research thread that is still active .    over the last 40 years a new approach that combines",
    "the stochastic behavior of elemental entities as well as their mutual interactions has emerged ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "while a few - particle interacting system is hopelessly complicated and beyond the reach of analytical techniques , a dramatic simplification arises for a many - particle system because we can often make _ statistical _ predictions about its fate . that a macroscopic interacting system is simpler than its few - element counterpart has several appellations  the law of large numbers , ergodicity , etc .",
    " and it justifies the utility of statistical physics and probability theory in attempts to understand economic processes .        in this short review , we present an interacting many - agent _ asset exchange _ model that can be quantitatively analyzed using statistical physics tools",
    ". an agent could be a single person or a self - contained economic entity , such as a company .",
    "in this model , the interaction between two agents results in a redistribution of their assets .",
    "we regard an asset as any economic attribute  cash , goods , or other materials  that contributes to overall individual wealth .",
    "the macroeconomy is viewed as the result of a large number of asset exchanges between randomly - selected pairs of agents . through these exchanges a global wealth distribution develops , and we want to understand how generic features of this distribution depend on the nature of the exchanges .",
    "the notion that the wealth distribution is driven by two - person exchanges appears to have been first considered in the economics literature by angle  @xcite . in the physics community , this approach was introduced by ispolatov et al .",
    "@xcite , and related perspectives on this subject include refs .",
    "a comprehensive review of this research topic is given in  @xcite and an engaging non - technical exposition appears in  @xcite .",
    "as a preliminary , we first study additive exchange processes , in which a fixed amount of asset is exchanged between two agents , independent of their wealth before a trade occurs . at the outset",
    ", we have to determine how to treat agents whose wealth reaches zero as a result of many unfavorable trades .",
    "we treat such penurious agents as economically `` dead '' , so that they no longer participate in the evolution of the wealth .",
    "mathematically , this rule corresponds to imposing an absorbing boundary condition on the density of agents of zero wealth .",
    "an alternative is to impose a reflecting boundary condition at zero wealth , so that all agents continue to economically interact , even if they have no wealth  @xcite . in this latter case",
    ", the wealth follows the boltzmann distribution of equilibrium statistical mechanics , with an effective temperature equal to the average amount of wealth per agent .    under the condition that bankrupt agents are eliminated from further economic activity ,",
    "we determine the consequences of : ( i ) _ fair _ transactions , where either agent is equally likely to profit in an interaction , and ( ii ) _ greedy _ transactions , in which the richer agent profits in an interaction . for simplicity , each agent",
    "is assumed to possess an integer - valued amount of assets and that one unit of asset is transferred between traders in each interaction .      in a fair exchange ,",
    "the wealth of two agents evolves as @xmath0 ; the direction of the exchange is independent of their starting wealth .",
    "the wealth distribution evolves by selecting two agents at random who exchange one unit of wealth and repeating this elemental step _",
    "ad infinitum_. we assume that all agents are equally likely to interact with any other agent ( corresponding to the mean - field limit in statistical physics ) .    in this limit , the evolution of the wealth distribution is described by a _ master equation _ that accounts for the changes in wealth in each microscopic interaction between agents .",

    "equation  ( [ cx ] ) is soluble by elementary techniques  @xcite , and the asymptotic wealth is simply the step function @xmath63 while the density of active agents decays as @xmath64 . in greedy exchange ,",
    "the number of viable agents decays faster than in random exchange and the population is slightly wealthier , with the average wealth growing as @xmath65 rather than as @xmath32 .",
    "while additive exchange provides instructive warm - up examples , multiplicative exchanges , where a fixed fraction of the current wealth of one of the agents is traded , are economically more realistic .",
    "for example , investment returns are generally quoted as percentages rather than absolute amounts .",
    "a trade now has the form @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the fraction of the loser s assets that are gained by the winner . by multiplicative exchanges",
    "agents can never go bankrupt , but they can become arbitrarily poor .",
    "if an agent gains or loses with equal probabilities in a transaction , the wealth distribution evolves as @xmath68\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the delta functions cleanly indicate the origin of the various terms in this equation .",
    "for example , the first two terms on the right account for the loss of agents of wealth @xmath69 due to trades with any other agents .",
    "the next two terms account , respectively , for the gain in @xmath70 due to the exchanges @xmath71 and @xmath72 . integrating over the delta functions ,",
    "the master equation becomes @xmath73 where we set the ( conserved ) total density to one .",
    "equation   is daunting , and it is simpler to study the evolution of the moments , @xmath74 , that quantify the wealth of a typical agent .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the first two moments , the population @xmath75 and the wealth density @xmath76 , are conserved ; we choose @xmath77 and @xmath78 without loss of generality .",
    "more interesting behavior arises for the second moment equation @xmath79 whose solution is @xmath80\\,e^{-\\alpha(1-\\alpha)t}~.\\ ] ] all moments beyond the second also converge to non - zero steady - state values .",
    "this steady state arises because the wealth of a rich agent substantially diminishes in a losing multiplicative exchange , but its wealth increases only slightly in a winning exchange .",
    "conversely , a poor agent suffers a slight loss in a losing exchange but can gain substantially in a winning exchange .",
    "these two countering outcomes tends to move all agents toward a middle class .      when only the richer agent gains in an exchange , the master equation is now @xmath81 numerically , we find that the resulting wealth distribution is a power law ( fig .",
    "[ ge ] ) , with most of the population impoverished .",
    "pervasive impoverishment arises because greedy exchange causes the poor to become poorer and the rich to become richer , but wealth conservation forces there to be many more poor than rich agents . in the long - time limit",
    ", a small fraction of the population possesses most of the wealth .     of greedy multiplicative exchange with @xmath82 on a double logarithmic scale for times @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , 10 , 13 , and 16.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    an exact formal solution to eq .",
    "is  @xcite @xmath85 this distribution is pathological , however , because positive the moments @xmath86 of this distribution are divergent .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) can only apply within an intermediate scaling regime @xmath87 , a restriction that leads to finiteness of all the moments . to determine this scaling region",
    ", we use eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) to compute the moments and obtain : @xmath88 since @xmath77 and @xmath76 are constants , we infer that @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these cutoffs correspond to the wealth of the poorest and richest agent , respectively , in the population .",
    "it is only within these ranges that the wealth distribution is a power law , as shown in fig .",
    "asset exchange represents a parsimonious mechanism for the gain and loss of individual wealth in an economically active population . in spite of the obvious shortcomings of considering only this single factor among the myriad of influences on individual wealth , asset exchange models lead to a rich array of wealth distributions . for additive asset exchange",
    ", the wealth distribution can be explicitly derived for a variety of microscopic exchange rules . for greedy multiplicative exchange , where the richer agent always gains in an interaction ,",
    "a scaling - based approach indicates that the wealth distribution has an evolving power law form , @xmath91 .",
    "power - law distributions occur in the high - wealth tail of the wealth distribution in various economies , with the associated exponent in the range of 1.62.2 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as alluded to in the introduction , a variety of stochastic models , where agent undergoes an independent stochastic process , have also been invoked to argue for this power law  @xcite . in contrast , greedy multiplicative exchange is based on a combination of stochasticity and microscopic interactions between agents .",
    "there are many directions in which asset exchange models have been extended to make them more realistic ; recent work along these directions can be found in ref .",
    "specific examples of such additional elements include the incorporation of the saving of assets  @xcite , speculative trading  @xcite , and other forms of wealth redistribution .",
    "the notion of exchange of assets has also been applied to construct a migration model for the distribution of city sizes  @xcite .",
    "it should prove interesting to examine the role of such redistribution mechanisms in the ideologically - free setting of statistical physics modeling .",
    "the underlying assumption of conserved assets in an exchange neglects the possibility of wealth growth because of the exploitation of a natural resource , technological developments , or by both agents benefiting in exchanges .",
    "these are issues that appear ripe for further development .",
