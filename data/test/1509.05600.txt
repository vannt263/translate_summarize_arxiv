    "in multi - user mimo systems , one main challenge is the increased complexity and energy consumption of the signal processing to mitigate the interferences between multiple co - channel users . to achieve energy efficient transmission , the multi - user mimo system with very large antenna arrays at each base station ( known as `` massive mimo '' system )",
    "has been advocated recently @xcite .",
    "the key result is that , with very large antenna arrays at each base station , both the intracell and intercell interferences can be substantially reduced with simple linear beamforming ( bf ) processing @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "full - duplex relaying ( fdr ) is a promising approach to improve the spectral efficiency ( se ) of relaying network while retains the merits of half - duplex relaying ( hdr ) ( e.g. , path loss reduction ) . in fdr ,",
    "the relay transmits and receives simultaneously at the same frequency and time , but at the cost of a strong echo interference ( ei ) due to signal leakage between the relay output and input @xcite . to mitigate ei",
    ", three approaches have been investigated , i.e. , 1 ) passive cancellation , 2 ) time - domain cancellation @xcite and 3 ) spatial suppression @xcite .",
    "the passive cancellation relies on a combination of path loss , cross - polarization and antenna directionality @xcite .",
    "the time - domain cancellation is based on the fact that ei signal is known at full - duplex node .",
    "thus , it can be regenerated and removed in time - domain @xcite . in spatial suppression",
    ", ei is mitigated with the multiple transmit / receive antennas by approaches such as null - space projection @xcite . inspired by these works ,",
    "a number of works have dedicated to the study of fdr protocol on both theory and testbed ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . to achieve spectral and energy efficient transmissions of multiple source - destination pairs , recent works sought to incorporate both hdr @xcite and fdr @xcite-@xcite with massive mimo .    however , the aforementioned works on massive mimo are actually based on the assumption that the base stations or relays are equipped with a large number of high - quality transmit / receive radio frequency ( rf ) chains ( which are expensive and power - hungry ) .",
    "in contrast to conventional mimo system ( e.g. , at most 8 antennas in lte system ) , massive mimo must be built with low - cost components @xcite since the deploy cost and energy consumption of circuits will increase dramatically as the number of antennas grows very large .",
    "such low - cost components are prone to hardware imperfections ( e.g. , phase noise , nonlinear power amplifier , i / q imbalance , nonlinear low - noise amplifier and adc impairments ) , which must be considered in the design of practical massive mimo system .",
    "this paper focuses on the transceiver design for massive mimo full - duplex relaying ( mm - fdr ) with hardware impairments .",
    "the effect of hardware impairments is modeled using transmit / receive distortion noises @xcite .",
    "there are several challenges in the design of practical transceiver scheme in the considered system .",
    "the first is : _ how to deal with the ei cancellation without instantaneous ei channel ? _",
    "ei cancellation is a critical problem in mm - fdr transceiver design which is not only important to reduce ei power , but also useful to reduce distortion noises caused by hardware impairments at the relay ( as will be shown in section iv ) .",
    "different from fdr with small - scale relay antenna arrays @xcite-@xcite , the instantaneous ei channel is usually not easy to obtain in mm - fdr .",
    "this is because the learning of ei channel requires training sequence with length not less than the number of relay antennas @xcite , which is prohibitive in mm - fdr as the channel coherent time is limited .",
    "the lack of ei channel makes traditional ei cancellation techniques ( e.g. , time - domain cancellation and spatial suppression ) difficult to apply .",
    "although passive cancellation does not relies on ei channel estimation , it usually can not provide satisfactory performance when used alone @xcite .",
    "another problem is : _ how to suppress distortion noises caused by hardware impairments at sources and destinations . _",
    "different from multi - user interference ( mui ) , the distortion noise caused by transmit imperfection of source can be viewed as an interference signal with the same channel as transmit data .",
    "thus , it can not be suppressed by relay antenna arrays during coherent combining ( similar problem appears in reception at destinations ) .",
    "this causes performance ceiling on achievable rate as the number of relay antennas grows large , which degrades the gain of massive mimo significantly .    in this paper",
    ", we propose practical transceiver scheme for mm - fdr with hardware impairments considering the above problems .",
    "different from the traditional mm - fdr protocol @xcite ( where sources and destinations are equipped with single antenna ) , we consider a general model where sources and destinations are allowed to equip with multiple antennas .",
    "the contributions are summarized as follows :    * we first examine the limitation of traditional mm - fdr protocol under hardware impairments . in particular , we derive the upper bound on end - to - end achievable rate for traditional mm - fdr protocol with linear processing at the relay .",
    "the bound reveals that the achievable rate is limited by the hardware impairments at the sources and destinations , and performance ceiling appears as the number of relay antenna grows large .",
    "the result also implies that it is impossible to cancel the `` ceiling effect '' with linear processing , if sources and destinations are only equipped with single antenna . *",
    "based on the upper bound analysis , we propose a hardware impairments aware transceiver scheme ( hia scheme ) to mitigate the distortion noises by exploiting the statistical channel knowledge and antennas arrays of sources / destinations .",
    "the scheme needs no instantaneous knowledge of ei channel .",
    "the asymptotic end - to - end achievable rate of mm - fdr with hia scheme ( hia - mm - fdr ) is derived and the scaling behaviors of mui , ei and distortion noises are determined .",
    "* a joint degree of freedom and power optimization ( jdpo ) algorithm is presented to further improve the se of hia - mm - fdr .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the related work . the system model is described in section iii .",
    "the upper bound of achievable rate is analyzed in section iv .",
    "the hia scheme is proposed in section v and the jdpo algorithm is presented in section vi .",

    "<S> this paper studies the massive mimo full - duplex relaying ( mm - fdr ) , where multiple source - destination pairs communicate simultaneously with the help of a common full - duplex relay equipped with very large antenna arrays . </S>",
    "<S> different from the traditional mm - fdr protocol , a general model where sources / destinations are allowed to equip with multiple antennas is considered . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the conventional mimo system , massive mimo must be built with low - cost components which are prone to hardware impairments . in this paper , the effect of hardware impairments is taken into consideration , and is modeled using transmit / receive distortion noises . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a low complexity hardware impairments aware transceiver scheme ( named as hia scheme ) to mitigate the distortion noises by exploiting the statistical knowledge of channels and antenna arrays at sources and destinations . a joint degree of freedom and power optimization algorithm </S>",
    "<S> is presented to further optimize the spectral efficiency of hia based mm - fdr . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the hia scheme can mitigate the  ceiling effect \" appears in traditional mm - fdr protocol , if the numbers of antennas at sources and destinations can scale with that at the relay .    </S>",
