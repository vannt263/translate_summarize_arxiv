    "it becomes clear that , with either @xmath0 or oxygen abundances , the halo stars define two clear distinct sequences ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .",

    "have mostly v @xmath5 0 and r@xmath4 @xmath2 1 kpc .",
    "they seem to be a group of non - rotating stars going very close to the galactic center , a behavior that might be expected to be shown by accreted stars that sink to the galactic center by dynamical friction .",
    "they also form a very tight and well - defined sub - sequence in a diagram of [ fe / h ] vs. log ( be / h ) ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "this fact helps to explain why the halo stars show a larger scatter in this kind of diagram .",
    "the splitting into two components may be related to the accretion of external systems or to variations of star formation in different and initially independent regions of the early halo .",
    "the interpretation is still open , it is however clear that the halo is not a single uniform population with a single age - metallicity relation .",
    "a similar division was found by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the division seems clearer when be is used as a time scale .    for the thick disk",

    "a similar correlation however is not seen for be .",

    "* smiljanic et al .",
    "( 2009)).,width=499 ]      one remaining question is how does this possible division of the halo stars compare to our current understanding of the formation of the galactic halo ? given that we are analyzing a sample of local halo stars this division is likely not a consequence of the inner vs. outer halo dichotomy , as discussed for example by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* carollo et al . ( 2007 , 2009 ) ) . according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carollo et al . ( 2007 ) ) , the outer halo has a metallicity distribution that peaks at [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath32.20 and dominates the stellar population in distances beyond 1520 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the inner halo , on the other hand , has a metallicity distribution that peaks at [ fe / h ] = @xmath5 @xmath31.60 and dominates the stellar population in distances up to 1015 kpc .",
    "although we did not check in detail to which of these halo components our sample stars belong , we note that they have metallicities between [ fe / h ] = @xmath32.00 and @xmath30.50 .",
    "the low-@xmath0 stars in particular have @xmath31.20 @xmath2 [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath30.70 .",
    "we thus believe most of our sample stars are definitely inner halo stars .",
    "this implies that our results suggest a dichotomy of the inner halo .",
    "there are other literature results that seem to indicate a possible division of the inner halo , from both the observational and the theoretical point of view . on the observational side , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* morrison et al . ( 2009 ) ) , based on the kinematics of a sample of metal - poor stars , conclude that the local inner halo seems to divide into two components .",
    "one is moderately flattened , has no rotation , has a clumpy distribution in energy and angular momentum , and [ fe / h ] @xmath6 @xmath31.50 .",
    "the second is highly flattened , has a small prograde rotation , and @xmath31.50 @xmath6 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 @xmath31.00 .",
    "this last component is distinct from the metal - weak thick disk .",
    "on the theoretical side , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zolotov et al . ( 2009 ) ) present new simulations of the formation of disk galaxies in a @xmath7cdm universe .",
    "they allow for star formation both in the primary potential well of the galaxy being modelled and in dark matter subhalos that are later accreted .",
    "they show that the final stellar population in the inner halo of a galaxy formed like this has a dual nature .",
    "it is composed both by ` in situ stars ' , formed in the inner galaxy and later displaced to the halo , and by accreted stars , formed in the subhalos .",
