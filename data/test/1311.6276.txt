    "@xcite the level broadening depends on the dot - lead coupling strength , which can be manipulated via the lead distance or through the choice of different metal - molecule anchoring groups .",

    "that is why recently , the discussion of the thermopower has been extended to the nonlinear regime.@xcite then the question arises , how the thermoelectric coefficients can be generalized .",
    "our approach in the present work is motivated by the experimental situation : for a given temperature bias we determine the thermovoltage numerically by minimizing the thermally induced charge current .",
    "we base our calculations on the anderson - holstein model . here , the organic molecule is represented by a single energy level and a local optical mode , which is linearly coupled to the electron on this level .",
    "the quantum dot is connected to two macroscopic leads , while the local mode is coupled to a phonon bath .",
    "the current between the leads is given by the interacting dot density of states.@xcite based on such models , different methods have been applied , such as the numerical@xcite and functional renormalization group@xcite , rate equations,@xcite master equations@xcite and nonequilibrium keldysh green functions@xcite to describe transport through the dot for small - to - large dot - lead coupling and weak - to - strong ep interaction . in the antiadiabatic , strong ep coupling regime ,",

    "moreover , long electron residence times and strong ep interaction may lead to the accumulation of energy at the dot and , consequently , to its degradation.@xcite because of this , the regime of comparable electronic and phononic time scales and intermediate ep interaction becomes interesting .    to account for the polaronic character of the dot - state away from the strong ep coupling , antiadiabatic limit",
