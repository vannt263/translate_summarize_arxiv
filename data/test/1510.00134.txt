    "at the end of their life , low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath0 at the beginning of main - sequence ) evolve from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) towards the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase . during the agb period , the star undergoes a relevant mass loss @xcite and sheds its outer layers , which form a circumstellar envelope ( cse ) .",
    "as the cse expands , it gets cooler and the material can condense to form dust .",
    "the cse absorbs the radiation from the central star and re - emit the absorbed light in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the agb phase definitely ends when most of the outer layers have been shed .",
    "then , the net mass - loss rate decreases and the stellar wind becomes hotter and faster . this post - agb stage represents the intermediate phase between agb stars and pne @xcite",
    "in this phase the fast and hot wind sweeps up the stellar ejecta to form circumstellar shells . the resulting dust and gas nebula surrounding the post - agb stars",
    "is usually referred to as protoplanetary nebula ( ppn ) .",
    "this process ends when the central star , having lost entirely its outer layers , exposes its inner layers , hot enough to ionise the cse .",
    "finally the star enters the pn phase . during the agb phase",
    "the stellar wind is characterised by a general isotropy , responsible for the spherical symmetry of the cse",
    ". however more than half pne show elliptical or bipolar shapes , and similar asymmetric shapes are observed in ppne .",
    "it was thought that this loss of symmetry arose during the early post - agb phase ( see @xcite and references therein ) , however recent studies show that the stellar wind can undergo a departure from spherical symmetry already in the agb phase @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , roundish pne reasonably derive from roundish ppne , where a roughly spherical symmetry has never been lost ( see @xcite for a discussion about round ppn and pn candidates ) .",
    "the study of the different morphologies of ppne has become fundamental to develop accurate magnetohydrodynamics models of the evolution of the cse @xcite , which , in turn , influences the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "therefore the identification of new ppne provides remarkable insights and constraints on the study of the fundamental physics involved in the last stages of stellar life and in the interstellar medium evolution .    in two previous works",
    "@xcite we reported the open issue of the classification and characterisation of the compact galactic bubbles ( ` mbs ' hereafter ; @xcite ) discovered with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ at @xmath1 by the mipsgal survey @xcite .",
    "in particular , we showed how radio observations represent a valid and valuable instrument for this purpose .",
    "the mbs , at @xmath1 , are characterised by an apparent roundish morphology , small angular dimensions ( usually @xmath2 ) and a usual lack of counterpart at other wavelengths .",
    "they are thought to be the circumstellar shells of different kinds of evolved stars .",
    "currently about 30 percent of the mbs are classified , @xmath3 percent of them as pne , but with examples of massive stars ( luminous blue variables , wolf  rayet stars , g and k giants , ob stars ) and supernova remnants @xcite as well . since among the classified object one",
    "is a ppn ( see section [ sec : spitzer ] ) , it is not possible to rule out the possibility that some other mbs could be ppne .    in this paper",
    "we briefly discuss about the infrared morphology of known example of ppne and we infer which would be the most likely expected morphology for a ppn in the mbs sample ( section [ sec : spitzer ] ) . as an independent test to search for possible ppne among the mbs , in section [ sec : oh ] we report new observations searching for oh masers towards a sub - sample of 169 mbs .",
    "oh masers in fact are a common feature of oxygen - rich agb and post - agb stars , observed in about 80 percent of them .",
    "indeed the presence of oh maser emission during the whole post - agb phase , or even later , is associated with asymmetric stellar winds and cses @xcite .",
    "for spherical symmetric post - agb stars oh masers should be observed only in their early moments ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to notice that many bubbles are only barely resolved in mipsgal and therefore a roughly circular appearance may hide an actual asymmetric shape . for these reasons it is however worth to investigate the possible oh maser emission in the mbs .",
    "since the post - agb phase is relatively short ( @xmath5 ) , these objects are quite rare .",
    "indeed , the first systematic searches for post - agb stars became feasible only with the ir satellites .",
    "the heated dust envelope makes the post - agb stars have very peculiar ir colours .",
    "in fact , in the last three decades , one of the most reliable way to identify agb and post - agb stars has been through their _ _ iras _ _ colour ( e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the resolution of _ iras _ did not allow any morphological study of their cse , and all they appeared as point sources .",
    "ground- and space - based instruments , especially in the last years , are efficiently improving and complementing _ iras _ observations of agb and post - agb stars .",
    "for example , @xcite carried out mid - ir observations with the very large telescope and the gemini observatory aimed at studying the dust distribution of 93 objects ( agb and post - agb stars , young pne and massive evolved stars ) .",
    "they were able to resolve 17 ppne , showing the different possible shapes that these objects present .",
    "the morphology of two of them , namely iras 07134 + 1005 and iras 19500 - 1709 , strikingly resemble that of mbs .",
    "many others instead present a relevant asymmetry .",
    "the typical angular dimension of the ppn reported in their work is less than @xmath6 , considerably smaller than the typical mbs extension .",
    "these observations are very important because they point out that : a ) in the mid - ir the ppn is not necessarily heavily outshined by the central post - agb stars ; b ) many ppne could be only barely resolved in mipsgal ( resolution @xmath7 ) and all the different shapes can result in a unique roundish appearance .",
    "therefore it is , at least plausible , that several ppne can be present in the mbs sample .",
    "the improvement in sensitivity and resolution introduced by _",
    "spitzer _ gave the possibility of a space - based imaging for this class of stars .",
    "in fact , at least for near agb and post - agb stars , it would have been possible to resolve their cse . to have a first clue on the typical ppn appearance in mipsgal , we took the post - agb catalogue by @xcite and the toru catalogue @xcite to search for post - agb stars in the survey tiles .",
    "we found that these objects appear as extremely bright point sources and about 90 percent of them produces a saturated image .",
    "furthermore their high brightness translates to evident sidelobes that make it hard to investigate their cse .",
    "only one ppn of the toru catalogue was clearly resolved in mipsgal , namely the ppn iras 16115 - 5044 .",
    "this source is indeed associated with the mb mge 332.2843 - 00.0002 , and it is the only known ppn among the mbs . at @xmath1 ,",
    "following the @xcite morphological classification , it appears as a very bright roundish source with a detected central source ( figure [ fig : ppn_m24 ] ) and a diameter of @xmath8 .",
    "centred on the ppn iras 16115 - 5044 .",
    "the southern region of the nebula is saturated . ]",
    "the central source is still visible at least down to @xmath9 ( 2mass @xmath10-band ) , while there is no evidence of the cse at wavelengths shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite estimate a distance of @xmath11 , which would translate in a cse diameter of about @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , about 95 percent of mbs classified as pn present a ` disk ' or a ` ring ' shape at @xmath1 , without a central source , neither at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the terms ` disk ' and ` ring ' describe only the observation appearance of the mbs ( not their intrinsic morphology ) , the former is referred to round sources with a relatively flat brightness profile while the latter to round sources whose brightness significantly increases toward the edge ( please refer to @xcite for the complete nomenclature ) .",
    "their typical diameter is usually around @xmath13 , about a half of iras 16115 - 5044 .",
    "the examples presented in this section are useful to determine how a potential ppn among the mbs would appear .",
    "we have showed that at @xmath1 a large sample of known post - agb stars appear as very bright point sources . on the other hand ,",
    "almost all the mbs classified as pn are ` disks ' or ` rings ' ( figure [ fig : pn ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "we infer that the most probable morphology for a ppn mb would be that of a ` disk ' .",
    "in fact the ` disk ' shape can be viewed as produced in several possible ways : a ) the source is a filled shell ; b ) the source is an empty shell but it is too compact or too far to be resolved as a ` ring ' ; c ) there is still a central source visible at @xmath1 whose brightness is comparable with that of its ` ring'-shaped cse , and it completely fills the ` ring ' hole ; d ) the source is intrinsically asymmetric but is only barely resolved ; e ) the source is intrinsically asymmetric but is oriented in a such a way to appear roundish . to support this conjecture , in figure",
    "[ fig : ppn_far ] we report a simulated view of iras 16115 - 5044 as it would appear if it were twice as farther",
    ".     posed twice as farther as it is .",
    "the white rule is 15-arcsec long.,width=226 ]    it is possible to notice a clear emerging ` disk ' appearance in agreement with our theoretical speculation . on the contrary in figure [ fig : pn2_dss ]",
    "we report a higher - resolution optical image of pn mge  003.5533 - 02.4421 ( known also as ic 4673 ) whose mipsgal image has been showed in figure [ fig : pn ] .",
    "we can see how a clear non - spherical morphology ( @xmath14 as calculated by @xcite ) can be easily confused with an almost perfect round shape when observed at lower resolution or at different wavelengths .",
    "according to what has been stated in the last section , the presence of a relevant number of ppn among the mbs was a plausible hypothesis that deserved further considerations and an independent check .",
    "a very important aid came from radio observations , searching for maser emission .",
    "in fact , in the cse of agb and post - agb stars , conditions for maser emission from different molecules occur .",
    "the presence of oh , sio and h@xmath15o masers is a common feature of the cse of this kind of stars , and their appearance and disappearance has been used as a powerful indicator of their evolutionary state @xcite .",
    "maser emission from oh molecules strongly characterises ppne , with detection rate around 80 percent ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if a relevant number of ppne were present in the mbs then we should be able to detect maser emission from many of them .    among the possible choices",
    ", we decided to observe the four oh 18-cm transitions .",
    "these lines arise from ground state of oh ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , split by @xmath18 doubling and hyperfine interaction into four sublevels @xcite .",
    "the rest frequencies of the resulting transitions are 1612.231 , 1665.402 , 1667.359 and @xmath19 ( for simplicity we will refer to them dropping the decimal digits ) .",
    "the lines forming at 1665 and @xmath20 are usually referred to as the ` main lines ' , while the others as the ` satellite lines ' .",
    "the choice to observe at this frequency was motivated by the fact that oh maser emission at 1612 , 1665 and @xmath20 are observed for most of the duration of the post - agb phase , unlike sio and h@xmath15o ( the @xmath21 masers characterise shocked nebulae , like snrs , instead ) .",
    "furthermore it is easy to observe simultaneously all the four transitions given their small frequency separation .",
    "this possibility is fundamental to identify the emission arising from the diffuse interstellar environment , rather than from single sources ( see section [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "the observed sources are a sub - set of the total 428 mbs .",
    "in particular we first extracted those objects with a declination @xmath22 , well suited for observations from the northern hemisphere .",
    "subsequently we excluded the sources already classified in simbad : none of them , in fact , is classified as ppn and the very first general goal of the study of the mbs is their classification .",
    "the final sample contained 169 sources .",
    "we did not pose any constraint deriving from their 24-@xmath23 m shape .",
    "for checking purpose we observed the well known maser sources oh26.5 , vx sgr and w51 m .    a pilot experiment , on a smaller sample of sources ,",
    "was carried out with the medicina 32-m radio telescope on july 2011 . however , because of a severe contamination by radio - frequency interferences ( rfi ) , line detection proved almost impossible .",
    "we therefore decided to use the green bank telescope ( gbt ; project 12a-106 ) , given its extremely sensitivity and its location in a radio quiet zone .",
    "furthermore the higher resolution achievable with the gbt , with respect to medicina radio telescope , would have helped us to reduce spurious detections ( see section [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "the observations with the gbt were performed in four different blocks between january and march 2012 , for a total amount of 22 hours .",
    "each source was observed once ( mostly ) , twice or three times , in frequency switching mode .",
    "since the observations could be regarded as ` blind ' , the number of different scans per source was driven only by a minimisation of the telescope slewing time . with this configuration ,",
    "the total on / off duration of each scan was @xmath24 , split in 120 1-s long acquisitions on and 120 off .",
    "as front - end we used the @xmath25-band receiver in gregorian focus , with a system temperature @xmath26 and a gain of @xmath27 .",
    "we observed in 4 spectral windows ( each spectral window consists of one ` on ' and one ` off ' sub - band ) by means of the gbt spectrometer , in double polarisation mode ( circular polarisation ) .",
    "the spectral windows were chosen so as to observe all the four lines associated with the oh 18-cm transitions .",
    "the bandwidth for each spectral window was @xmath28 with a channel spacing of @xmath29 , allowing us to reach a velocity resolution of about @xmath30 .",
    "the expected rms was of order of @xmath31 .        for each spectral window we had two sub - bands ( one ` on ' and one ` off ' ) observed in two polarisations ( acquired simultaneously ) , for a total of 4 scans per spectral window per source .",
    "each scan consisted of 120 different 1-second acquisitions , so that it could be considered as a @xmath32 matrix , where 4096 is the number of channels .",
    "mapping this matrix is extremely useful to detect and flag rfi - corrupted data .",
    "in fact , interferences usually appear as spikes well confined in time .",
    "once the degraded acquisitions have been dropped , the four different scans for each spectral window were averaged together in order to obtain a mean spectrum .",
    "each mean spectrum was corrected for bandpass gain by fitting an opportune polynomial .",
    "finally the fitted polynomial curve was regarded as an estimate of the continuum background and subtracted from the mean spectrum .        among the 169 spectra ,",
    "139 show oh lines , in emission or in absorption , in at least one spectral window . in 109",
    "we find the peculiar features of the diffuse interstellar medium : the main lines appear in absorption with a height ratio close to 5:9 ( expected in case of lte ) ; the two satellite lines show the same height but one in emission and the other in absorption @xcite . in this case",
    "the four lines have approximately the same profile , the same velocity and the same width .",
    "they usually appear as broad lines , whose width ranges from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "a typical spectrum with the diffuse medium signature is reported in figure [ fig : diffuse ] .",
    "the recognition of these patterns allowed us to exclude these lines from the maser search .",
    "we ended up with 44 spectra showing emission features that could not be ascribed only to diffuse medium .",
    "five spectra show multiple lines , likely emerging from different sources within the gbt beam ( about @xmath35 fwhm at @xmath36 ) .",
    "following the notation introduced by @xcite , we found 44 double - peaked ( d - type ) and 7 single - peaked ( s - type ) lines at @xmath37 and one d - type line at @xmath20 .",
    "we were conscious that because of the large gbt beam ( with respect to an interferometer ) and because of its high sensitivity many detected masers could have been located a few arcminutes away from the pointing centre .",
    "as first assessment , we checked the catalogue of the atca / vla oh @xmath37 survey by @xcite . the major clue to cross",
    "identify known masers was to compare line velocities .",
    "we noticed that many masers could be identified with sources very distant from the pointing centre : we measured distances up to half a degree .",
    "some sources were then detected through gbt sidelobes .",
    "the sensitivity of the gbt and the very high brightness of maser emission are the causes of this issue .",
    "in fact the relative heights of the first two sidelobes ( at @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the pointing centre ) are approximately @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see @xcite for the gbt beam model ) . given these values , a maser line with a brightness of tens or hundreds jansky would be still easily detected with our sensitivity",
    ".    the 25 spectra with maser lines that do not have a catalogue identification might be referable to the mbs . to check if these matches are plausible we decided to produce datacubes from the aforementioned survey .",
    "@xcite in fact did not produced images of their observations due to the extreme computational load required .",
    "they limited their search to an automatic method that was able to identify only very bright masers ( the typical rms was @xmath42 , but with significant variations across the field ) .",
    "a complete imaging of the survey is far beyond our computational possibility , therefore for each new detected maser we used the survey data to create small datacubes ( @xmath43 across ) centred in the mb positions . at the end of this process",
    ", we were able to discard 7 detections and to reasonably confirm one ( section [ sec:3337 ] ) . due to the high noise",
    ", the matching of 17 spectra remained uncertain ( figure [ fig : uncertain ] ) . in the table [ tab :",
    "det ] we report the confirmed and the uncertain matches . for the excluded matches see appendix a."
