    "we use non - local sources to allow a more accurate extraction of ground state masses and couplings . combining our results at all three @xmath3-values",
    ", we can extract the continuum limit and assess the size of discretisation effects .",
    "we find that dimensionless ratios of observables have small discretisation corrections .",
    "we highlight the uncertainties remaining in extracting continuum decay constants because of the reliance on perturbative matching coefficients .",
    "the sw fermion action is written in the form    @xmath5    with hopping parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the quark fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 which appear in any observable must also be transformed ( rotated ) .",
    "for an on - shell observable bilinear in the quark fields , the equation of motion can be used to express this as an improved observable given by  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the size of the clover term in the action is determined by the coefficient @xmath11 . at tree - level",
    ", @xmath11 is equal to one . as demonstrated by heatlie _",
    "@xcite , the terms of order @xmath12 are removed for this choice of @xmath11 .",
    "a mean field estimate of this coefficient was suggested by lepage and mackenzie @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the poor agreement of lattice perturbation theory with monte carlo simulations of short  distance observables is explained by the presence of non  physical `` tadpole '' diagrams .",
    "one expects the power expansion for the gauge link @xmath13 to be valid for sufficiently small @xmath12 .",
    "however , tadpole diagrams introduce ultraviolet divergences which can partly cancel the factors of @xmath14 .",
    "a solution to this is to rescale the gauge link by a factor @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 .",
    "the factor @xmath15 is chosen so that a monte carlo calculation of a short distance observable using the rescaled gauge field agrees with the perturbative calculation . an appropriate choice is @xmath17 inserting this factor into the sw action changes the hopping parameter to @xmath18 and the clover coefficient @xmath11 from 1 to @xmath19 .",
    "a perturbative evaluation of @xmath11 by naik @xcite gives a numerically similar value which is some support for the assumption of dominance of the tadpole diagrams .",
    "gauge configurations were calculated at @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , using spatial volumes that are approximately the same . at each lattice spacing ,",
    "propagators at 2 quark masses , straddling the strange quark mass , were calculated for each configuration  see table 1 .",
    "hadronic correlations were evaluated for each combination of such quarks , yielding three mesonic masses .",
    "hence the extrapolation to the chiral limit could be explored using three hadronic masses .",
    "the configuration and propagators at @xmath20 and @xmath2 were calculated on a 320 node cray t3d .",
    "the gauge configurations and propagators at @xmath0 were calculated respectively on a 16 and 64 node i860 meiko computing surface . for the transformation in eq .",
    "[ eq : rotation ] , we take @xmath21 which corresponds to no rotation in the propagators .",
    "the propagators were calculated using both non - local and local sources so that ground state and excited state contributions to correlators could be separated effectively .",
    "local sinks were employed . at @xmath0 , jacobi smeared sources @xcite were used , and correlations were measured with three combinations ( neither , one , both ) of nonlocal and local quark propagators in a meson . at @xmath20 , local and `` fuzzed '' sources were used @xcite . a fuzzed source can be written in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an su(3 ) matrix representing the average of the fuzzed paths of gauge links from the origin to @xmath24 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fuzzed ] for a schematic description ) .",
    "fuzzing is less computer expensive than jacobi smearing , as the only numerical work involves the averaging of the gauge links .",
    "it is gauge invariant and avoids time spent in gauge fixing .",
    "we use the fuzzing prescription with 5 iterations as in ref .",
    "@xcite and we choose @xmath25 at @xmath20 .",
    "an example of the advantage of fuzzing at the source is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - mass - fuzzed ] where an efficient extraction of the ground state vector meson is seen .",
    "we focus on the pseudoscalar and vector mesons . in order to evaluate accurately the central value and statistical errors",
    ", we fit to as many channels of data as possible .",
    "furthermore , to isolate the ground state for a wide range of time slices , we use a two - exponential fit .",
    "the two  point correlations can be expressed as a sum over transfer matrix eigenstates @xmath26 here @xmath27 where @xmath28 are operators that have overlap with the ground and excited mesonic states @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these operators can be local or nonlocal , or have different gamma matrix structures .",
    "for both mesons , we fit simultaneously to all the available local and non - local source correlations of two  point functions .    in the case of the pseudoscalar",
    ", we note that the fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 will create / annihilate the pseudoscalar , hence a simultaneous fit is performed to two  point functions with the four combinations pp , ap , pa , aa . these contributions can be described in a factorising fit by the amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the pseudoscalar state .",
    "this provides tight constraints on the fit .",
    "we define the lattice decay constant for a pseudoscalar meson , @xmath36 as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the _ local _ axial current operator .",
    "the lattice @xmath39 will be related to the continuum value @xmath40 by including quark field rotations , setting the scale @xmath12 and including the appropriate matching coefficient @xmath41 .",
    "one can determine @xmath36 directly from the factorising fit , without fitting to a ratio of channels as was used previously @xcite .",
    "an example of the result of such fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effective_mass_ps ] .",
    "likewise , simultaneous fits for the vector meson can be performed using the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and different smearing / fuzzing combinations .",
    "the lattice vector decay constant , @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the local vector current .    despite the quite large statistics used in this calculation",
    ", the large number of different types of two - point functions requires that a full correlated fit must be carried out carefully . in particular , we employ the methods described by michael and mckerrell@xcite for the inversion of the correlation matrix . at @xmath20 and @xmath2",
    ", we model the correlation matrix with two exponents using the 5-diagonal approximation of ref .  @xcite . at @xmath0 , we average all but 20 of the largest eigenvalues of the correlation matrix .",
    "we fit to the largest range of @xmath47 consistent with an acceptable @xmath48 .",
    "the errors quoted in this preliminary report are statistical only .",
    "the ground state pseudoscalar and vector masses are determined by the fits to two - particle correlations as described above .",
    "the issue of the rotations of the quark fields is irrelevant to mass determinations and will be discussed later .",
    "we define @xmath49 by the requirement @xmath50 for each lattice . at each lattice spacing ,",
    "a linear extrapolation in the two squared pseudoscalar masses ( where the quark masses are degenerate ) was carried out .",
    "the results for @xmath51 are given in table 2 .",
    "a full fit using also the meson mass determined from the non  degenerate quark ",
    "mass case is possible , however , the fits gave statistically significant evidence for some curvature in @xmath52 versus @xmath53 .",
    "without tadpole  improvement , there has been no agreement of non - perturbative lattice determinations of @xmath49 with one loop perturbation theory . for wilson - like fermion actions",
    ", it is found that the tadpole ",
    "improvement factor of @xmath15 makes @xmath54 closer to the tree - level value of 1/8 .",
    "for example , a determination of @xmath55 using the @xmath56 clover action  @xcite at @xmath4 gave a result of @xmath57 which corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "for the tadpole  improved action explored here , we present in table  2 the comparison of the non - perturbative results for @xmath54 with the one loop perturbative calculation . here",
    "we have chosen to use a coupling derived from @xmath59 .",
    "although the agreement is excellent at @xmath4 , the trend as @xmath3 is decreased is not .",
    "this lack of agreement of @xmath55 between non - perturbative determinations and one  loop perturbation theory at smaller @xmath3 will cause some uncertainty in normalisation when quark mass factors are included in the determination of the decay constants .",
    "the experimental value of the difference @xmath60 remains remarkably constant , at approximately @xmath61 , over a wide range of masses .",
    "quenched lattice simulations of relativistic quarks have been in poor agreement with this result , and the discrepancy increases as the quark mass is increased . in the heavy quark regime ,",
    "such splitting has a leading order dependence on the chromo  magnetic coupling of the heavy quark with the gluon field .",
    "this is precisely the term which is amplified in the tadpole ",
    "improved clover action .",
    "while one can not make a similar statement in the light quark regime , it is plausible that this modification of the clover term will also have a significant effect there .",
    "a comparison at @xmath4 can be made with non tadpole - improved ukqcd data  @xcite , based on 60 configurations .",
    "these configurations exist as a subset of the @xmath62 configurations available now .",
    "a comparison of the results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tadpole - comparison ] .",
    "unfortunately , there is no significant statistical difference between the two actions .",
    "we will soon have results for fuzzed sources in the tadpole - improved mass extraction which should lead to a reduction of errors .",
    "the behaviour at all three lattice spacings is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsq - minus - mpssq ] .",
    "the scale ( @xmath63 ) is determined from the chirally extrapolated @xmath64 .",
    "the fall - off of the splitting with respect to @xmath52 is slightly faster than one would expect by comparison with the physical splittings @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , until this difference is examined for quark masses around that of the charm quark , the advantage of tadpole improvement in this case remains unproven .",
    "the dimensionless ratio of masses is known to have discretisation errors of order @xmath67 for the sw - clover fermionic action .",
    "the tadpole - improved variant should preserve this result and is expected to improve on it by reducing the coefficient .",
    "we explore this by studying such ratios of observables against an observable proportional ( to leading order ) to @xmath12 .",
    "since the wilson gauge action has inherent discretisation errors of order @xmath14 , it is advantageous to use this as a reference .",
    "we present ratios of @xmath68 to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the string tension determined by interpolating all existing data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrho - on - tension ] , we find that the ratio is constant ( within statistical errors ) at @xmath20 and @xmath4 .",
    "there is however , a significant deviation from this constant for the ratio at @xmath0 .",
    "since this behaviour is consistent with @xmath14 , it could be ascribed to the discretisation errors in either ( or both ) of the pure - gauge or fermionic quantities .",
    "it is important to compare lattice results in the quenched approximation without chiral extrapolation if possible , since there are known to be anomalies in the chiral limit of a quenched theory . as suggested by lacock and michael @xcite",
    ", a dimensionless quantity can be constructed using this data without having to perform a chiral extrapolation : @xmath71 where the slope and @xmath72 are to be evaluated at the vector mass satisfying @xmath73 which corresponds to the @xmath74 meson .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] and there is no evidence of any discretisation error since the values of @xmath75 from each lattice spacing are equal within errors .",
    "our result agrees with that from most existing quenched lattice data which are consistent  @xcite with a value of @xmath75 of 0.37 .",
    "this value is in disagreement with experimental data and , to substantiate this discrepancy , we will need a careful study of systematic errors , particularly at our largest @xmath3-value .",
    "as can be seen from eqs .",
    "[ eqn : f_ps - def ] and [ eqn : twopt - vector ] , the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath76 can be easily obtained from the lattice data .",
    "however , to evaluate the physical quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 , one has to specify a suitable normalisation for the quark propagators and a renormalisation factor for the lattice operators . for fermion actions of the kind of eq .  1 ,",
    "several equivalent solutions have been proposed . to estimate the size of the systematic error induced by relying on perturbative estimates of the matching factors , we present here two interpretations of the action ( eq .",
    "1 ) with @xmath79 which result in relatively large differences .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is due to both our ignorance on the contribution of @xmath80 terms in the perturbative expansion , and to the possible different interpretations of the tadpole improvement procedure .",
    "* normalisation i *    in this case we interpret the clover coefficient @xmath79 as a consequence of the tadpole improvement , which implies a redefined hopping parameter ( @xmath51 ) and a gauge field rescaling . because @xmath81 , the covariant derivative ( or the lattice bare mass for the unrotated case @xmath21 which we are using ) which appears in eq .",
    "2 has to be divided by @xmath15 .",
    "we choose , however , to adopt a slightly different normalisation , which amounts to using the renormalized quark mass , @xmath82 instead of the bare mass since the `` rotation '' factor @xmath83 is then relatively closer to unity and possibly better reproduced by perturbation theory .",
    "this is possible because formally the difference between the bare mass and the renormalised mass only contributes at order @xmath67 which does not effect the improvement .",
    "the renormalisation constants to be used in this case differ from those corresponding to the sw action , and have been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are @xmath84 where we choose to use @xmath85 as an appropriate improved estimate of the coupling .",
    "there is an inherent systematic error from the choice of scale for this coupling - this can only be resolved by a two - loop calculation .",
    "* normalisation ii *    let us consider the results one obtains using the action of eq .  1 with @xmath79 but without attributing to such a coefficient the meaning of tadpole subtraction . because of that both the hopping parameter and the normalisation of the propagator itself keep their original values .",
    "moreover , since the perturbative expansion of the clover coefficient is 1 , up to terms of @xmath86 , the renormalisation constants are the same as those calculated for @xmath56 , given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "we used the `` unrotated '' operators corresponding to taking @xmath21 in eq .  2 , where @xmath87 is now interpreted as the `` bare '' lattice quark mass .",
    "in order to compare with other work , at each @xmath3 , we extrapolate the lattice decay constants to the chiral limit assuming a linear behaviour with @xmath52 .",
    "the dimensionless quantities @xmath88 and @xmath89 are shown for each normalisation in figs .",
    "[ fig : f - pi - on - string ] , [ fig : one - on - f - rho ]",
    ".    the results for @xmath90 for both normalisation schemes are consistent with having a common continuum limit which agrees with the experimental value .",
    "as @xmath3 is decreased , the difference between normalisations i and ii increases .",
    "this largely arises from the fact that the perturbative estimate of @xmath87 is not in agreement with the numerical value ( it is therefore due to large unknown contributions at @xmath91 ) , and this causes a poor renormalisation in the case ii . an insight into this problem could be achieved by calculating the `` rotated '' operators of eq .  2 with @xmath92 , which would permit us to eliminate the uncertainty in the renormalisation of the quark mass .",
    "such a study is currently in progress .",
    "ideally , however , one should measure the matching constants non - perturbatively , as outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 results  @xcite for @xmath90 at @xmath4 are seen to lie significantly lower in fig .",
    "[ fig : f - pi - on - string ] . a careful study of systematic errors is needed to explore this discrepancy further . since we have used different rotation factors ( @xmath21 for @xmath79 and @xmath92 for @xmath56 ) , the effect of this difference on the discrepancy",
    "can also be determined by a study of @xmath92 for the tadpole ",
    "improved case .",
    "[ fig : one - on - f - rho ] shows for @xmath93 a rather similar picture of agreement between the continuum limit of the tadpole  improved schemes and experiment . in this case the @xmath56 result is also in agreement .",
    "the goal of lattice investigations of qcd is to find a formalism which has small discretisation errors .",
    "this has to be studied by obtaining results for a wide range of observables for several lattice spacings . in this paper",
    "we have outlined preliminary results on the spectrum and couplings from a tadpole  improved sw clover action .",
    "we find that , within our present statistical errors , the results at @xmath20 and 6.2 are consistent while those at @xmath0 show signs of discretisation effects .",
    "this is encouraging since it suggests that meaningful results can be obtained at 6.0 which corresponds to @xmath94 . to push the frontier down to 5.7",
    ", it seems plausible that an improved gauge action will also be needed since the ratio of @xmath95 evaluated using the wilson gauge action is known to deviate significantly at @xmath0 so that there are significant order @xmath14 discretisation errors here .",
    "we also emphasize that continuum extraction of decay constants and matrix elements is beset with ambiguity if a perturbative matching is used .",
    "this arises in part because the critical hopping parameter is not accurately given by 1 loop perturbation theory .",
    "a non - perturbative determination of these matching coefficients is essential for fully reliable continuum predictions .",
