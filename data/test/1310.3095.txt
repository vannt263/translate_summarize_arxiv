    "in recent years , systems where strong correlations between particles are induced by pair - wise scattering , have attracted much attention . in the canonical example , which is the parametric down - conversion ,",
    "photon pairs are generated during the propagation of a laser beam through a non - linear medium .",
    "the outcoming pairs of photons are entangled , and can serve as a probe of fundamental properties of quantum mechanics @xcite , such as the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox , or violation of the bell inequalities @xcite . on the other hand , entanglement can be exploited in practical applications , such as teleportation @xcite or metrology beyond the shot - noise limit ( snl ) @xcite .    in this latter context , recent experiments with entangled states of atoms were a major breakthrough @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "two - body interactions were utilized to prepare non - classical squeezed states of atoms trapped in a double - well potential , which implies presence of many - body entanglement @xcite .",
    "a similar idea was exploited to generate squeezing in the internal @xcite degrees of freedom . in @xcite , squeezing of a large spin of a collection of two - level atoms was achieved , using an intense laser field interacting with particles trapped in an optical cavity .",
    "simultaneously , a substantial experimental effort was put in order to generate entangled pairs of atoms scattered out of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in @xcite , a collision of two becs lead to weak scattering of correlated atomic pairs onto a three - dimensional sphere of initially unoccupied modes .",
    "although moderate number - squeezing between the opposite regions of the halo , and the related violation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality were experimentally demonstrated @xcite , entanglement was never directly observed .",
    "alternatively , pair - production schemes were developed , where only few modes are strongly populated in a stimulated process , making the system somewhat easier to handle .",
    "stimulated four - wave - mixing processes have been implemented using different spin states of atoms @xcite or bragg scattering @xcite . also , dynamic instabilities in moving optical lattices , populating modes with opposite quasi - momenta , have been used @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a bec was transferred into the first excited state of a trapping potential and subsequent two - body collisions created a `` twin - beam '' system , where stronger - than - classical correlations could directly be observed .",
    "analogous schemes have been implemented in internal atomic states , building upon spin - changing collisions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was shown that particles scattered in this process into a pair of @xmath0 zeeman sub - levels are usefully entangled from the metrological point of view .    in this work",
    "we develop a theoretical model for the generic type of experiments , where particles scatter in pairs into two well - separated regions .",
    "if these regions are separated in the momentum space , they could also be set apart by a sufficiently long expansion of the cloud . on the other hand , in cases",
    "when the regions are defined as two zeeman sub - levels , they can be separated in space using a stern - gerlach scheme .",
    "our model applies to any such possible configuration .",
    "therefore , the general conclusions of this study , concerning the correlations , number - squeezing and entanglement , are valid for recent experiments @xcite in the regime , where the depletion of the source bec is low .",
    "we derive the bogoliubov equations governing the dynamics of pair formation , and applying the bloch - messiah reduction @xcite , we write the state in terms of pairs of independently squeezed modes .",
    "we calculate the density and the number of scattered atoms , and the two body correlation between them .",
    "we demonstrate the presence of ideal number - squeezing between the opposite regions , violation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality and , using the fisher information criterion known from quantum metrology , we show that the atoms from the twin - beam system are entangled .",
    "we also provide a simple yet useful lower bound for the fisher information in terms of the average number of scattered atoms , and the number of modes they occupy .",
    "finally , we apply the above formalism to the twin - beam experiment of @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ universal ]",
    "we discuss the general properties of the solutions of the bogoliubov equations .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we first present the general properties of the solution of the bogoliubov equation , in cases where particles scatter pair - wise into well - separated regions .",
    "our theoretical description of the pair - production process starts with a many - body hamiltonian with contact two - body interactions    [ ham ] @xmath1    here @xmath2 is an external trapping potential and @xmath3 is the strength of the two - body interactions , @xmath4 is the scattering length , @xmath5 is the atomic mass and the field operator @xmath6 satisfies the bosonic commutation relations . to derive the bogoliubov equation",
    ", we first find the c - number ( mean field ) wave function of the bec using the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xmath7 we then write the field operator as a sum of the c - number part and the bogoliubov correction , @xmath8 and insert this expression into ( [ ham ] ) . by keeping only the terms up to quadratic in @xmath9",
    "we obtain the bogoliubov hamiltonian @xmath10 the resulting bogoliubov equation of motion is linear @xmath11 usually , a numerical solution of this equation is found in a following way .",
    "the field operator is expanded in a basis of wave - functions @xmath12 which match the geometry of the scattering problem @xmath13 this expression is inserted into eq .",
    "( [ bog ] ) , the resulting equation is multiplied by @xmath14 and the outcome is integrated by sides over the whole space . in effect , what we obtain is an equation of motion , which , through the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 , couples the evolution of the @xmath17-th operator @xmath18 , with ( in general ) all others operators @xmath19 this equation is linear  a consequence of the linearity of the bogoliubov equation ( [ bog ] )  so the general solution of ( [ eq_mot ] ) reads @xmath20 where the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 and @xmath24 . later , we will apply this method to solve the bogoliubov dynamics of the twin - beam production .",
    "however , we will show in the following , that in cases where the detailed form of the hamiltonian ( [ bog_ham ] ) drives the scattering of atomic pairs into opposite regions ( as indeed happens in twin - beam experiments ) , the basic properties of the system can be deduced analytically if an appropriate set of mode functions @xmath25 is chosen .",
    "let us denote the two separate regions into which the particles are scattered by l ( left ) and r ( right ) .",
    "particles populate l and r in a process of elastic scattering , so the regions are usually separated in momentum space . from this point of view , it is convenient to switch to the space of wave - vectors @xmath26 and decompose the field operator as follows @xmath27 the operators @xmath28 annihilate a particle in a mode characterized by the time - dependent wave function @xmath29 , which is localized in the right / left region in momentum space .",
    "we underline , that this kind of separation is also present in position space after expansion of the cloud , or after application of a stern - gerlach pulse in internal - state experiments , respectively .",
    "moreover , the vector @xmath26 might denote the quasi - momentum , if the scattering takes place in an optical lattice .",
    "formally , the only difference between the formulation ( [ op_nondiag ] ) and ( [ op_diag ] ) is the splitting of the field operator into the r and l modes .",
    "however , for a linear equation of motion such as ( [ bog ] ) , there exists a unique basis of mode functions for which the evolution equations of the mode pairs decouple from each other :    [ pair_evolution ] @xmath30    where @xmath31 .",
    "this form of the bogoliubov equation has a simple physical interpretation : atoms scatter pair - wise into opposite regions , and the total field operator ( [ op_diag ] ) is a sum of independent mode pairs , which are squeezed in their relative population fluctuations , as will be explained in detail below .",
    "although the diagonal form ( [ pair_evolution ] ) is much clearer than ( [ nondiag ] ) , it is not obvious at the moment how this particular basis ( [ op_diag ] ) can be found .",
    "this is done in two steps , applying the procedure of the bloch - messiah reduction @xcite .",
    "first , using equations ( [ op_diag ] ) and ( [ pair_evolution ] ) , we evaluate the one - body density matrix ( first - order correlation function ) and obtain @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath34 is the average occupation of the @xmath35-th eigen - mode , and that a pair of modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 is degenerate ( has the same eigen - value @xmath34 ) due to the assumed symmetry between the left and the right region . since we are using the heisenberg picture , the average value in eq .",
    "( [ den_mat ] ) and all equations that follow are calculated in the initial vacuum state of scattered atoms .    in any practical approach ,",
    "if the basis ( [ op_diag ] ) is not known a priori , this step first requires a numerical evaluation of the density matrix ( [ den_mat ] ) in any convenient basis ( [ op_nondiag ] ) , and subsequent diagonalization .",
    "once this is done , then according to eq .",
    "( [ den_mat ] ) , the basis functions @xmath29 are the momentary eigen - functions of the one - body density matrix ( natural orbitals ) .",
    "however , a second step is necessary to fully determine the functions @xmath29 , because the density matrix  contrary to the field operator ( [ op_diag ] )  is insensitive to global phases of the mode functions . to retrieve this additional information",
    ", we calculate the anomalous density @xmath38 multiply it by sides with the eigen - functions of the density matrix and integrate over space . as a result , we retrive the information about the phases and obtain the full form of the mode functions @xmath29 of the diagonal basis .    to summarize , we have outlined the structure of the solution of the bogoliubov equation for cases where atoms are scattered into two opposite regions .",
    "we will now show that the extra step , which is the transition from the `` numerical approach '' ( [ op_nondiag ] ) to the diagonal basis ( [ op_diag ] ) , allows to easily determine the basic properties of the system of scattered atoms , like its density or higher correlation functions .",
    "the simplest observable characterizing the pair - production process is the density @xmath39 which is , consistently with our derivation , localized in the two opposite regions . by integrating the above function over space ,",
    "we obtain the information about the expected number of scattered atoms as a function of time @xmath40 additional information about the system is carried by the correlations between the scattered particles .",
    "the probability of simultaneous detection of two atoms at momenta @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be obtained from the normalized second - order correlation function @xmath43 according to the wick s theorem , this function can be written in terms of the one - body density matrix ( [ den_mat ] ) and the anomalous density ( [ anom ] ) as follows @xmath44 the transition from eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) to ( [ g2_w ] ) might seem an unnecessary complication , however we will argue that it allows for a simple and intuitive interpretation of the second - order correlation function . according to eq .",
    "( [ den_mat ] ) , the density matrix is non - vanishing only when @xmath41 and @xmath42 are both either in the right or left region , so @xmath45 governs the hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) type of local correlations . on the other hand , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ anom ] ) , the anomalous density is non - zero only when @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in the opposite regions , so it describes the cross - correlations between the two members of the scattered pair . clearly , this simple interpretation of the second order correlation function as a sum of local- and opposite - momentum correlations would have been much more difficult if we had not applied the diagonalization procedure and the wick s theorem .",
    "another property characterizing the scattering process are the fluctuations of the population imbalance between the two regions .",
    "if these fluctuations are suppressed below the properly defined shot - noise level , the system is _ number squeezed _ , which proves that the atoms scatter in pairs rather then independently to the left and to the right region . a quantitative description of the number squeezing involves the left and right atom number operators defined as the integrals of the density operators over the corresponding volumes , i.e. @xmath46",
    "the population imbalance operator is then simply defined as @xmath47 and using eq .",
    "( [ op_diag ] ) we obtain @xmath48 the number squeezing factor is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the variance of the population imbalance operator . if the fluctuations between the two regions are suppressed below the shot - noise level defined as @xmath51 , the system is called `` number - squeezed '' . in our case , since @xmath52 does not depend on time and the initial state is a vacuum , we obtain that @xmath53 . therefore , the two - region bogoliubov system is perfectly number - squeezed , as anticipated in the previous section .",
    "the ideal number - squeezing is a result of clear separation of the two scattering regions . in such case ,",
    "it is natural to define the local atom - number operators ( [ at_num ] ) and the population imbalance operator ( [ pop_imb ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that not all systems , where particles are scattered in pairs are perfectly number squeezed .",
    "for instance , when two bose - einstein condensates collide , they produce a halo of atoms due to two - body elastic scattering into the initially unoccupied modes @xcite . in this system",
    "however , there is no simple way to define two separate regions .",
    "one can instead measure the number of atoms in two bins lying on the opposite sides of the halo .",
    "moderate number - squeezing of the atom number difference between these bins has been observed experimentally @xcite , but it is impossible to reach the limit @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the twin matter wave configurations @xcite , are ideal sources of correlated atomic pairs occupying two well - defined areas .      apart from the number squeezing",
    ", the twin - region system can be characterized by another expression , which is called the cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "it relates the strength of the local and opposite correlations to witness the pair - scattering process .",
    "following @xcite , we define averaged second - order correlations as @xmath55 where @xmath56 . in the symmetric case ,",
    "the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath57 can now be re - written as @xmath58 using expressions ( [ den_mat ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) we obtain    @xmath59    thus the cauchy - schwarz inequality reads @xmath60 which is true only for all @xmath61 .",
    "as soon as particles start to scatter into the two regions , the cauchy - schwarz inequality is clearly violated . to quantify the degree of violation ,",
    "a coefficient @xmath62 was introduced in @xcite , which reads @xmath63 when @xmath64 the system is in the `` classical '' regime , while @xmath65 signify correlations which are stronger than allowed by the classical physics . in our case",
    "this coefficient reads @xmath66 clearly , always @xmath65 , because it is a sum of unity and a non - negative part . for high mode populations @xmath34 , the second term , which is inversely proportional to the number of scattered particles tends to zero , restoring the classical limit",
    "nevertheless , as demonstrated with photons in @xcite , the confidence by which the cauchy - schwarz inequality can be violated in the presence of classical noise still _ increases _ with more strongly populated modes .",
    "however , it is the fisher information , which is the quantity highly sensitive to particle entanglement in the high - gain regime , as we show in the following section .",
    "this measure quantifies the potential for sub - shot - noise interferometry , and increases with rising mode population , in spite of the decreasing `` granularity '' of the matter wave @xcite that leads to all second - order correlation functions approaching equal values .",
    "we now show that atoms occupying the two regions are entangled , and could be used as an input of a quantum interferometer operating below the shot - noise level .",
    "we first recall how the precision of the phase estimation is related to the entanglement of input states using as an example the standard two - mode mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) .",
    "then , we extend these concepts to the case , where the interferometer operates between two regions , each having a multi - mode structure determined by the bogoliubov equations .",
    "when speaking about two - mode interferometers , it is convenient to introduce a set of three operators    [ ang ] @xmath67    which obey the same commutation relations as the angular momentum operators .",
    "the mzi , which is an interferometric device , where the imprint of the phase @xmath68 onto the input state is preceded and followed by a pair of symmetric beam - splitters , can be represented by a unitary evolution operator @xmath69 .",
    "if the phase is estimated in a series of @xmath70 measurements performed on the output state , the precision of the phase estimation is limited by the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) @xcite , @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , which is related to the unitary transformation @xmath73 . for pure states transformed by the mzi it is equal to @xmath74 , where the variance is calculated in the input state of the interferometer @xcite .",
    "the crlb states , that if @xmath68 is determined using any possible type of measurement and estimator , then the precision @xmath75 is bounded as in eq .",
    "( [ crlb ] ) .    apart from providing a lower bound for the error of the phase estimation",
    ", the @xmath76 is an entanglement measure .",
    "namely , when the input state has an average number of @xmath77 particles , then if @xmath78 , the state is particle - entangled @xcite .",
    "we now show , that a natural extension of the two - mode picture allows to employ the concept of the qfi as an entanglement measure also in our multi - mode system of interest . to this end , we introduce the following analog of the two - mode angular momentum operators ( [ ang ] ) ,    [ ang_twin ] @xmath79    where we dropped the explicit time - dependence of the @xmath80 to simplify the notation . also , for simplicity , we choose the well - separated regions r and l to be localized symmetrically on the opposite sites of @xmath81 .",
    "the construction of these operators , which satisfy the same commutation relations as ( [ ang ] ) , is based on the analogy between the two - mode systems and the twin - beam configuration . in the former case ,",
    "the operators connect the right and left modes , while in the latter the left and right sub - spaces .",
    "such a definition ( [ ang_twin ] ) is meaningful only in situations , where the system consists of two well - separated sub - systems . using the decomposition of the field operator into the set of independent modes , equations ( [ op_diag ] ) and ( [ pair_evolution ] ) , the above integrals yield , that each angular momentum operator is a sum of operators acting on each mode independently , that is    [ ang2 ] @xmath82    these expressions show again that it is natural to describe the two - region system using the diagonal basis ( [ op_diag ] ) . in this language ,",
    "the angular momentum operators are simply a sum of operators acting on each pair of modes independently , which vastly simplifies the further analysis .    to establish a direct relation between the two - mode and two - region case",
    ", we now assume that the system is transformed in the multi - mode analog of the mach - zehnder interferometer . as outlined above , to demonstrate the presence of useful entanglement between the atoms in the left and in the right , it is necessary to calculate the qfi . using eq .",
    "( [ ang2 ] ) we obtain that @xmath83 since the construction of the basis ( [ op_diag ] ) explicitly assumes that each mode is independent from all others , the second term in the last equality is @xmath84 , because the symmetry between the @xmath85 and @xmath86 regions implies that @xmath87 for all @xmath35 .",
    "therefore we obtain that the qfi is equal to @xmath88 where the last equality comes directly from the substitution of ( [ pair_evolution ] ) into the definition of the @xmath89 operator .",
    "also , we used @xmath90 , according to eq .",
    "( [ nscat ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath78 , so the system is entangled .",
    "moreover , one can refer the qfi to the ultimate bound for the precision of the parameter estimation , which is the heisenberg limit . for a system with fluctuating number of particles ,",
    "this upper bound is equal to @xmath91 . using ( [ pair_evolution ] ) again",
    ", we obtain , that @xcite @xmath92 for a large number of scattered particles , when @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 . the value of the qfi , which is only one - half smaller than the heisenberg limit is a clear indication of very strong entanglement present in the system in the high - gain regime . at intermediate times , @xmath95 due to mode competition , which has a negative impact on the entanglement as witnessed by the qfi @xcite . to picture this ,",
    "consider a `` frustrated case '' , where all atoms scatter uniformly into @xmath96 pairs of modes , so that all @xmath97 are equal . in this case , the number of scattered atoms is simply @xmath98 , and the qfi is @xmath99 .",
    "the qfi normalized to the snl is @xmath100 when , on average , there is less than a particle per a set of modes , i.e. @xmath101 , the qfi surpasses the snl only by a factor of 2 , a natural reminiscence of atoms being scattered in pairs .",
    "equation ( [ snl ] ) is a simple yet intuitive estimation of the lower bound of useful entanglement in terms of the number of scattered atoms and occupied modes .",
    "we now apply the above formalism to the twin - beam system of @xcite .",
    "first , we describe the physical mechanism which leads to the creation of the two correlated beams .",
    "as shown below , some basic information about the dynamics of the pair production allow to construct a simple one - dimensional bogoliubov model , which can be easily solved numerically .",
    "the experimental sequence applied in @xcite to produce correlated atom pairs was following .",
    "first , an almost pure bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath102 @xmath103rb atoms with scattering length equal to @xmath104 nm was created at temperature @xmath105nk .",
    "the cloud was trapped in an approximately harmonic potential @xmath106 where atomic mass is equal to @xmath107 , and the frequency @xmath108 is much smaller than @xmath109 and @xmath110 , so the bec is strongly elongated along the @xmath111-axis .",
    "after the bec was created , the trapping potential was shaken in a controlled way , so the atoms were transferred to the first excited state along the @xmath112-direction . in order to achieve the maximal transfer efficiency ,",
    "the shaking was optimized using quantum optimal control theory @xcite . afterwards , binary collisions transfered particle pairs to the ground state of the potential , and the excess energy @xmath113 was converted into back - to - back movement of the two atoms along @xmath111 .",
    "momentum conservation ensured , that their wave vectors had equal lengths @xmath114 and point in opposite directions .",
    "small corrections to the value of @xmath115 may arise from an effective mean - field potential , as will be discussed below .      neglecting thermal phase fluctuations along the elongated direction @xmath111 , which is valid at very low temperatures only  @xcite , the condensate wave function acting as a source for the pair - production",
    "can be found by solving the stationary gpe @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the chemical potential .",
    "this function can be evaluated numerically , by referring to the description of the experiment from the previous section , and noting that after the shaking of the trap , the bec is in the first excited state @xmath118 along the @xmath112 axis and in the ground state @xmath119 along @xmath120 . however ,",
    "this can be approximated by an analytical expression , as argued below .",
    "first note , that since the characteristic energies @xmath121 and @xmath122 are large , and the number of atoms in the bec is small , the non - linear term can be safely neglected in evaluation of the eigenstates along @xmath112 and @xmath120 . as a result , assuming that the total wave - function @xmath123 separates in three directions ( which has been confirmed numerically ) , we obtain @xmath124 where the functions @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the eigen - states of the one - dimensional harmonic potential in @xmath112 and @xmath120 correspondingly .",
    "the function @xmath127 is found by inserting the above expression into eq .",
    "( [ stat_gpe ] ) and integrating out the orthogonal directions . as a result",

    "since the trap is shallow in the @xmath111 direction , the solution of the stationary gpe ( [ gpex ] ) can be well approximated by the thomas - fermi ( tf ) formula @xcite @xmath133 where the effective chemical potential is @xmath134 leading to a tf radius of @xmath135 .",
    "within the approximation of neglecting thermal phase fluctuations , we have fully determined the wave - function of the bec , which we insert into the bogoliubov hamiltonian ( [ bog_ham ] ) .",
    "next , we expand the field operator @xmath136 in an orthonormal basis . along the @xmath112 and @xmath120 directions ,",

    "this reduces the dynamics of the pair - production to one - dimensional problem along the @xmath111 axis , with the orthogonal directions frozen out , i.e. @xmath139 where @xmath86 is the quantization volume .",

    "the expansion time was @xmath174 , which was sufficient to resolve the twin - beam peaks . nevertheless , the system was not fully in the far - field regime yet , which may have some impact on the correlation functions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_avgd ] , the finite expansion time affects the back - to - back peak at @xmath175 much more strongly than the collinear hbt peak , leading to smearing of the measured @xmath176 ( dash - dotted line ) over the entire size of the twin - beam packets .",
    "this observation is consistent with some previous results @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the broadening effect is related to the random position of scattering events along @xmath111 within the size of the initial cloud , which is non - vanishing with respect to the expanded size of the twin - beam peaks . on the other hand ,",
    "the local correlation function @xmath177 ( dashed line ) remains largely unaffected .",
    "note that although at every instant of the evolution , the field operator @xmath80 can be written as a sum of independently squeezed modes , at very early times the division between the right and left modes is unjustified , because the two peaks are not yet fully separated .",
    "however , at @xmath154ms when the density distribution is broad , the number of scattered atoms is @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , the system at such early time is hardly accessible experimentally so the quantum state of much less then a single particle is not of interest .",

    "[ general ] apply .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig_qfi ] we plot the qfi from eq .",
    "( [ qfi ] ) as a function of time and normalized to the heisenberg limit , i.e. @xmath181 . instead of interrupting the simulation at @xmath182ms , where the scattered fraction of atoms becomes non - negligible and particle number",

    "this is done solely to illustrate that , once the population of one of the modes dominates , @xmath185 , as argued in sec .",
    "[ entanglement ] .",
    "note that the dominance of a single mode pair at long times is also predicted by the number - conserving theory @xcite , justifying this proceeding .",
    "indeed , in the inset , we show the number of pairs of right / left modes which have an occupation bigger or equal to 10% of the largest mode .",
    "this approximately tells , how many modes are significantly occupied in the system . at early times , there are over 100 pairs of modes . at @xmath182ms",
    "there are still 5 significantly occupied pairs , and only around 4.2ms a single pair of modes starts to dominate . at the same time the qfi approaches its upper bound .    .",
    "the horizontal grey dashed line denotes the best possible value for the bogoliubov system , which is achieved in a regime , where only a single pair of left / right modes is relevant .",
    "the vertical grey dashed line denotes the time @xmath148ms , when the bogoliubov simulation should be interrupted . in the inset ,",
    "we show the number of pairs of left / right modes that have at least 10% of occupation of the largest modes .",
    "we see that only around 4.2ms , the two - mode approximation is valid , as denoted by the horizontal dashed line . ]",
    "we have developed a simple bogoliubov model describing twin - atom beam experiments similar to refs .  @xcite . due to the elongated geometry of the trapping potential ,",
    "the dynamics is one - dimensional . as a consequence",
    ", the final step of our method can be easily solved numerically without the need for any stochastic method .",
    "furthermore , basic information about the scattered particles can directly be drawn from the general properties of the solution of the bogoliubov equations . in this way",
    ", we can quantitatively characterize the mode structure and correlation functions of the scattered atoms .",
    "also , quite generally , we can show that the population imbalance between the two beams is ideally squeezed and that the system is strongly entangled .",
    "these general observations can be applied to most recent experiments , where the atomic pairs scatter into two well - separated regions . finally , using the notion of the quantum fisher information",
    ", we have derived a simple lower bound for the useful entanglement of the system .",
    "this expression employs only the average number of scattered particles and the number of occupied modes .",
    "having understood the fundamental properties of few - mode twin beams , further steps can be made to take into account more specific issues of experimental implementations .",
    "a general feature of strongly elongated bose gases at realistic temperatures , such as the source cloud in @xcite , is the quasi - condensation  @xcite , where the coherence along the @xmath111-axis is limited due to thermal phase fluctuations .",
    "although these fluctuations do not alter the general considerations of sec .",
    "[ general ] , they affect the emission dynamics @xcite , and also might have influence on the spatial properties of both the density and the correlation functions @xcite . in future",
    ", our method could be applied to the analysis of some more complicated schemes , basing on the twin - beam setup , such as the rarity - tapster - type experiments @xcite .",
    "also , according to our results , the two - region state could be used as an input to the mach - zehnder - like interferometer , similarly to @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the bogoliubov approximation neglects the secondary collisions between the scattered particles and the atoms from the source cloud . when a scattered atom propagates through the bec , the number of secondary collisions is bounded from above by @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the peak density of the bec . by plugging in the experimental numbers , we obtain @xmath188 , which well justifies the use of the bogoliubov approximation",
