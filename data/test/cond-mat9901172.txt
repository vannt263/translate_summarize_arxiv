    "there are several excellent review articles on trapped bose - condensed atomic gases written at a relatively introductory level @xcite , with emphasis on the dynamics of the condensate at @xmath0 . in the present lectures ,",
    "i will concentrate on the interplay between the condensate and non - condensate components .",
    "this topic requires a more sophisticated analysis based on the concepts and methods of many body theory .",
    "my lectures will attempt to give a very basic introduction to this kind of approach .",
    "the primary audience i have in mind are graduate students and postdocs coming from atomic and laser physics , rather than condensed matter theory .",
    "however , i hope the experts will also learn something from these lectures . in his lectures , fetter @xcite has given a detailed review of excitations in a trapped dilute bose gas at @xmath0 .",
    "he shows that a convenient way of discussing these excitations is to start from the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath1 .",
    "linearizing around the equilibrium value @xmath2 , one finds of the macroscopic wavefunction are given by the well - known bogoliubov coupled equations . for a uniform bose - condensed gas , the excitation frequencies are those first discussed by bogoliubov in 1947 @xcite .    at @xmath0",
    ", one can assume that all the atoms are in the bose condensate described by @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , in these lectures , my main topic will be to review our understanding of what excitations are in a bose - condensed gas at _",
    "finite _ temperatures , when there is a large number of atoms in the non - condensate ( in trapped gases , the non - condensate is often referred to as the `` thermal cloud '' ) .",
    "i will make some contact with the ideas discussed in the lectures by burnett @xcite .    the first half of these lectures ( sections  [ sec : elementary excitations and density fluctuations in normal systems ] - [ sec : why are excitations in a bose fluid so interesting ] ) deals with excitations whose very existence depends on self - consistent mean fields ( of various kinds ! ) , rather than on the collisions between atoms .",
    "in the standard language developed in condensed matter physics in the 1960 s , this means the excitations are in the `` collisionless region '' .    the second half of the lectures ( sections  [ sec : hydrodynamic oscillations in a trapped bose gas ] - [ sec : first and second sound in a uniform bose - condensed gas ] ) deals with excitations in the collision - dominated hydrodynamic region .",
    "i review the two - fluid hydrodynamic equations such as given by landau @xcite , generalized to include a trap .",
    "i give an explicit microscopic derivation of such two - fluid equations in a trapped bose gas .",
    "this extends recent work of zaremba , griffin and nikuni ( zgn ) @xcite to include the case when the condensate is not yet in local equilibrium with the non - condensate atoms .",
    "the type of questions i want to address in these lectures include :    1 .",
    "what is the difference between an elementary excitation and a collective mode ?",
    "2 .   can we",
    "_ isolate _ the dynamical role of the condensate on the nature of the excitations ? 3 .   at @xmath0 , with a pure condensate , excitations in a gas must be oscillations of the condensate .",
    "in contrast , above @xmath3 , the excitations are not related to a condensate . what happens to an excitation as we go from @xmath0 to @xmath4 .",
    "how does the excitation get rid of its `` condensate '' dressing ?",
    "what is the essential physics behind the different mean - field theories of excitations which have been discussed in the recent literature : gross - pitaevskii , hartree - fock - popov , hartree - fock - bogoluibov ?",
    "what is the physics behind the dreaded beliaev second - order approximation ?",
    "this is the first approximation which includes damping of the elementary excitations even at @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "why are the excitations and collective modes in a bose - condensed system uniquely interesting , compared to all other many body systems ?",
    "the key reason is , of course , that the condensate couples and hybridizes single - particle excitations with density fluctuations . above @xmath3",
    ", these two excitation branches are uncoupled .",
    "once this is understood , one sees why more detailed and systematic experimental studies of excitations in trapped atomic gases at finite temperature are of great importance .    to give a careful discussion of all these questions",
    "would need  10 lectures . in these  3 lectures",
    ", i will give a speeded - up version .",
    "i will often use a _ uniform _ weakly interacting bose gas to illustrate the structure of the theory .",
    "while i will only sketch the math , i will still try to give a flavour of what is involved .",
    "the approach i will use to discuss these questions is based on the field - theoretic formulation of a bose - condensed system of particles .",
    "as i review elsewhere in this volume  @xcite , this powerful formalism was introduced by beliaev  @xcite in 1957 and extensively developed in the golden period : 1958 - 1965 .",
    "i will introduce this formalism in a very schematic manner - but even experimentalists will find it useful to know some of the  language \" used in this approach .",
    "there are other methods to deal with collective modes in bose gases but they are not as useful at _ isolating _ the dynamical role of the condensate , or dealing with finite temperatures .",
    "while i will always have trapped atomic bose gases in mind , much of the general theory  @xcite is valid for any bose - condensed fluid ( gas or liquid ) .",
    "thus i will often make references to superfluid @xmath5he , pointing out similarities with bose gases .",
    "we work with quantum field operators : @xmath6 these operators satisfy the usual bose commutation relations , such as @xmath7=\\delta ( { \\bf r }   - { \\bf r'})$ ] . of course",
    ", if we have several hyperfine atomic states , then we have different field operators @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the hyperfine state label ( the analogue of a spin label ) .",
    "all observables can be written in terms of these quantum field operators .",
    "two important examples are the local density operator : @xmath10 and the hamiltonian @xmath11 { \\hat\\psi}({\\bf r } ) + { 1 \\over   2 } g \\int d{\\bf r } \\hat{\\psi}^+({\\bf r } ) \\hat{\\psi}^+({\\bf r } )   \\hat{\\psi}({\\bf r } ) \\hat{\\psi}({\\bf r } ) . \\label{eq : elementary excitations3}\\ ] ] in these lectures , the two - particle interaction will always be approximated by a @xmath12-wave scattering length , appropriate to a dilute bose gas at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( we set @xmath15 throughout this article ) .    what we want to calculate are various kinds of correlation functions involving different local operators : @xmath16 in these tutorial lectures",
    ", i will not bother to distinguish between the various kinds of correlation functions ( time - ordered , retarded , etc ) or even the difference between correlation functions and response functions .",
    "these are discussed in all the standard textbooks on many body theory @xcite but are only important when one is doing systematic calculations .",
    "a convenient summary of the formalism is given in a recent review article on homogeneous weakly interacting bose gases @xcite .",
    "the density response function @xmath17 involves four quantum field operators and is an example of a two - particle green s function @xmath18 .",
    "one can measure @xmath19 by coupling a weak external field to the local density in the system @xmath20 linear response theory gives @xmath21 for the density response ( see chapters 5 and 9 of ref.@xcite and chapter 2 of ref.@xcite ) . for a uniform system with @xmath22",

    "we note that @xmath33 and thus clearly the pole at @xmath28 is the signature of an oscillating density fluctuation .",
    "the basic correlation function in the field - theoretic approach is given by @xmath34 this single - particle green s function @xmath35 involves two quantum field operators .",
    "it describes creating an atom at @xmath36 , let it propagate through the system to @xmath37 and then destroying the atom .",
    "all other higher - order correlation functions such as @xmath38 can be constructed out of combinations of @xmath39 .",
    "for example , the _ lowest order _ contributions to the density response function in ( [ eq : elementary excitations5 ] ) are @xmath40 as we discuss in section  [ sec : green s function formulation ] , the terms in the last line of ( [ eq : elementary excitations11 ] ) vanish in a normal bose system but are finite for @xmath41 .",
    "the poles of @xmath35 correspond to what are called elementary excitations ( or quasiparticles ) . in a uniform system",
    ", we have @xmath42 one can show @xcite that these single - particle excitations determine the thermodynamic properties of interacting systems . however , it is very difficult to directly measure the spectrum of @xmath39 since one needs an external field which couples to @xmath43 , ie , an atom reservoir .",
    "later we will see that what makes a bose - condensed system unique is that we can easily access @xmath39 as a result of the effects of the bose condensate .",
    "finally we introduce the key idea of a single - particle self - energy through dyson s equation : @xmath44 where @xmath35 is the interacting single - particle green s function , @xmath45 is the non - interacting single - particle green s function and all effects of the two - particle interactions are contained in the self - energy function @xmath46 . in a uniform system , we can fourier transform this dyson equation to give @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",

    "we note that the self - energy @xmath55 is by definition highly non - perturbative . as an illustration ,",

    "it is easy to understand the physics which gives rise to this `` ideal - gas '' spectrum .",
    "the fourier transform of the local density operator in ( [ eq : elementary excitations2 ] ) is given by ( for a uniform system ) @xmath69 clearly @xmath70 creates a `` particle - hole '' density fluctuation with the following features : @xmath71 the spectrum ( [ eq : density fluc3 ] ) describes a broad incoherent superposition of particle - hole states @xcite and is not a true collective mode , such as we discuss next .",
    "the mean field approximation ( mfa ) for the density response is also called other names : scf ( self - consistent field ) , rpa ( randon phase approximation ) , but all involve the same physics .",
    "the mfa was introduced by bohm and pines in the period 1951 - 1953 , work which had a pivotal effect in our understanding collective effects in all many - particle systems .",
    "we recall the linear response expression in ( [ eq : elementary excitations7 ] ) , where @xmath72 is the _ full _ density response function for interacting bose gas .",
    "if we introduce the self - consistent hartree mean - field : @xmath73",
    "then we can approximate the linear response equation in ( [ eq : elementary excitations7 ] ) by @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{eq : density fluc7}\\ ] ] the system is assumed to respond as if the atoms propagate independently ( as described by @xmath75 but are moving in an effective field @xmath76 . in a uniform system ,",

    "physically , it is clear that zero sound is a `` collisionless '' density oscillation arising from dynamic self - consistent mean fields .",
    "we make a few comments about such `` zero sound '' collective modes :    1 .",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 ( the poles of @xmath54 ) are _ both _ states of an interacting many - particle system .",
    "however the collective mode disappears if there are no interactions , while the single - particle excitations still exist in a non - interacting gas .",
    "because of the low density , dynamic mean fields in normal systems are too weak to allow the existence of a well - defined ( weakly - damped ) zero sound mode in the bose gases of current interest ( for @xmath84 ) . if @xmath85 , we can then approximate @xmath86 .",
    "the situation is quite different for @xmath87 , when a coherent mean - field due to the condensate is present .",
    "one _ also _ expects a collective pole to appear in @xmath88 in the collision - dominated hydrodynamic region .",
    "however this sound wave pole is induced by rapid collisions producing local equilibrium , as we discuss in sections  [ sec : hydrodynamic oscillations in a trapped bose gas ] - [ sec : first and second sound in a uniform bose - condensed gas ] .",
    "ordinary sound is not described by the mfa discussed above , ie , it is not the result of dynamic mean fields .",
    "all the formalism we have been discussing for @xmath89 can be extended in a natural way to bose - condensed systems @xcite making use of the fundamental decomposition which separates out the condensate and non - condensate parts of the quantum fields : @xmath90 here the average is over a restricted ensemble @xcite consistent with @xmath91 .",
    "the most profound way of doing this is to add a symmetry - breaking field @xmath92 \\label{eq : green function2}\\ ] ] and work with @xmath93 , taking the limit @xmath94 at the end .",

    ", these anomalous correlation functions are as important as the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath101 .",
    "we also note that @xmath102 is the `` pair '' function that burnett  @xcite    discusses in detail , using a different formalism .",

    "given ( [ eq : oscillation of the cond1 ] ) , we have @xmath374 and hence @xmath375   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$ } \\left({\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\eta$ } } \\cdot [ 2 g   \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}{\\tilde n}_0 + g   \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}n_{c0 } ] \\right).\\label{eq : oscillation of the   cond7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result is equivalent to [ using ( [ eq : oscillation of the cond4 ] ) ] @xmath376 with @xmath377 the solution of ( [ eq : oscillation of the cond8 ] ) is clearly @xmath378    in a similar way , one can show that the hydrodynamic equations for the non - condensate lead to the same equation of motion ( [ eq : oscillation of the cond8 ] ) .",
    "the rigid motion of the non - condensate density profile corresponds to a distribution function given by @xmath379 this can be verified to solve the kinetic equation ( [ eq : semi - classical limit15 ] ) , using the fact that @xmath380 = 0 $ ] , and leads to the expression in ( [ eq : oscillation of the cond1 ] ) , namely @xmath381 this in - phase dipole mode was first exhibited by zgn in the hydrodynamic region @xcite .",
    "it is an important test of the proper treatment of the non - condensate dynamics .",
    "this kind of mode is generic , existing in the collisionless region as well @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the zgn two - fluid equations allow a very transparent discussion of first and second sound in a uniform gas @xcite . we find two sound - wave solutions : @xmath382 , @xmath383 .",
    "first sound has a velocity given by ( to lowest order in @xmath56 ) @xmath384 and mainly involves the non - condensate , with @xmath385 ( but in - phase ) .",
    "second sound has a velocity given by ( to lowest order in @xmath56 ) @xmath386 and mainly involves the oscillation of the condensate , with @xmath387 ( and out - of - phase ) .",
    "it is clear that second sound is the collision - dominated hydrodynamic mode which is the _ analogue _ of the collisionless bogoliubov phonon ( [ eq : green function13 ] ) which we discussed in section  [ sec : green s function formulation ] .",
    "the frequency vanishes ( becomes `` soft '' ) above @xmath3 and it is the expected goldstone mode of the bose broken - symmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to liquid @xmath5he , both second and first sound in a bose gas involve density fluctuations ( ie , second sound is not a temperature wave in a gas ! ) .",
    "can we study first and second sound pulse propagation in cigar - shaped traps ? in this volume , ketterlee @xcite reviews the beautiful pulse propagation experiments carried out at mit at low temperatures in the collisionless region @xcite . if we could get into the hydrodynamic region , one should be able to see _ two _ pulses propagate ",
    "roughly with the speeds @xmath388 and @xmath389 given above .",
    "this would be very dramatic and a direct confirmation of the superfluid dynamics described by the two - fluid equations .",
    "inside the broad , relatively uniform condensate distribution along the axis of the cigar - shaped trap , one could excite both first and second sound pulses , with the relative intensity of each propagating pulse given by @xcite @xmath390 the velocity of second sound would give [ using ( [ eq : sound velocity2 ] ) ] a direct measurement of the condensate density @xmath391 .",
    "perhaps of more interest , the velocity of the first sound pulse would give a relatively _ direct _ measurement [ using ( [ eq : sound velocity1 ] ) ] of the non - condensate density @xmath392 `` underneath '' the condensate .",
    "in sections [ sec : dynamics of the non - condensate atoms ] and [ sec : the two - fluid hydrodynamic equations ] , we discussed the linearized form of the generalized two - fluid equations @xcite which describe how the condensate relaxes to equilibrium with the excited atoms",
    ". these hydrodynamic equations with @xmath393 ( i.e. @xmath394 ) should also be useful in the study of how a condensate grows and comes into equilibrium with the thermal cloud @xcite . while based on a different formalism , our theory has points of contact with the work by gardiner , zoller and co - workers on the kinetics of condensate growth @xcite .",
    "however , our analysis , while assuming the existence of a condensate , takes the dynamical evolution of the non - condensate fully into account .",
    "the two - fluid dynamics of trapped bose - condensed gases promises to be a very rich subject , as discussed in ref .",
    "the region where @xmath393 is not easily studied in superfluid @xmath5he , largely because local thermal equilibrium is almost too easy to reach in a liquid .",
    "however , some years ago pitaevskii @xcite treated the regime very close to @xmath395 , when the superfluid density @xmath396 was not necessarily in equilibrium with the normal fluid density @xmath397 .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of trapped bose gases is that even if the centre of the trap is at large enough density so that one is in the hydrodynamic region described by dynamic local thermal equilibrium , this description will always break down in the low density non - condensate thermal cloud far enough from the trap centre .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite have shown that the cross - over region between the hydrodynamic and collisionless regions in this low density region plays the dominant role as the source of damping of certain kinds of hydrodynamic oscillations .    more generally , i would like to emphasize that the study of collective modes in trapped bose gases finally provides us with the opportunity of making a quantitative test of the complex dynamics of a system with a bose - broken symmetry . as i discuss elsewhere in this volume @xcite , the complexity of dealing with a liquid such as superfluid @xmath5he never allowed one to make a thorough confrontation of the microscopic theory of bose - condensed systems with experiment @xcite .",
    "bose gases finally allow us to do this , in a much cleaner fashion @xcite .",
    "i would hope that future studies on trapped bose gases will also stimulate new interest in the dynamics of superfluid @xmath5he as a bose - condensed liquid .",
    "the work presented here on the two - fluid hydrodynamic equations has been done in close collaboration with eugene zaremba and tetsuro nikuni .",
