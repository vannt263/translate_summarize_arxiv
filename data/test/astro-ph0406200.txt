    "agn outflows are evident by resonance line absorption troughs , which are blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift of their emission counterparts . in seyfert galaxies velocities of several hundred  ( crenshaw et  al .",

    "2000 , 2002 ; kaspi et  al .  2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "similar outflows ( often with significantly higher velocities ) are seen in quasars which are the luminous relatives of seyfert galaxies ( weymann et  al .",
    "1991 ; korista , voit , morris , & weymann 1993 ; arav et  al.2001a ) .",
    "reliable measurement of the absorption column densities in the troughs is crucial for determining the ionization equilibrium and abundances of the outflows , and the relationship between the uv and the ionized x - ray absorbers .    in the last few years our group ( arav 1997 ; arav et  al .",

    "in addition using the doublet method ( barlow 1997 , hamann et al 1997 ) we have also shown that in many cases the shapes of the troughs are almost entirely due to changes in the line of sight covering as a function of velocity , rather than to differences in optical depth ( arav et  al.1999b ; de  kool et  al .",

    "( 2004 ) for mrk  279 . as a consequence ,",
    "the column densities inferred from the depths of the troughs are only lower limits .",
    "most of the analysis cited above relies on comparing two troughs arising from the doublet lines of a given ion ( e.g. , the , and , doublets mentioned above ) .",
    "based on the oscillator strength of the doublet components , the blue transition must have twice the optical depth as the red transition . when the apparent optical depth method is used on fully resolved , high s / n",
    ", non - blended doublet troughs , the ratio of their @xmath7 is rarely 1:2 . in most cases ,",
    "the trough from the red doublet has more than half of the blue @xmath7 , up to equality in many cases . in order to determine the actual optical depth ( and hence column density ) , we use a pure partial covering model .",
    "we assume that only a fraction @xmath8 of the emission source is covered by the absorber and then solve for a combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 that will fit the data of both doublet troughs while maintaining the intrinsic 1:2 optical depth ratio ( see   3 for the full formalism , including velocity dependence ) .",
    "implicit in this model are the assumptions that the absorber covering the @xmath8 fraction of the source has the same optical depth across this area , and that the rest of the source is covered by material with @xmath10 in that transition .",
    "although widely used , the validity of the pure partial covering model should be questioned on two fronts .",
    "first , mathematically we solve for two unknowns ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) given two residual intensity equations .",
    "as long as the ratio of the residual intensities is in the permitted physical range ( see   3 ) , such a procedure will always yield a solution .",
    "a principal issue is , how valid is this solution physically ? to test the partial covering model we need more lines from the same ions and efforts in that direction will be described in forthcoming papers ( gabel et al .",
    "2004 , arav et al.2004 ) .",
    "the second question has to do with the rigid distribution ( essentially a step - function ) of absorbing material assumed by the partial covering model . here",
    "one may ask if an inhomogeneous distribution of absorbing material across the emission source can yield a good alternative to the partial covering model .    the first attempt to study generic inhomogeneous distributions of absorbing material in agn outflows",
    "was done by de kool , korista & arav ( 2002 , hereafter dkka ) .",
    "a formalism was developed to simulate the effects of an inhomogeneous absorber on the emerging spectrum and several examples of fitting existing data with this model were presented . in this paper we begin by giving a simplified version of the dkka formalism , and explain the spectrum arising from simple monotonic material distributions (   2 ) . since little constraints can be put on the formation of a single trough , in ",
    "3 we simulate and explain the formation of doublet troughs . in ",
    "4 we use these simulations in an attempt to fit the ,  and lyman series troughs seen in high - quality observations of mrk  279 . in light of these results , we assess the physical viability of inhomogeneous absorber models in   5",
    "in this section we introduce the formalism needed to calculate the attenuation caused by an inhomogeneous absorbing medium .",
    "our starting point is equation ( 6 ) from dkka :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the surface brightness distribution of the background source and @xmath13 is the line of sight optical depth at wavelength @xmath14 in front of a specific @xmath15 location , as defined by dkka equations ( 3 - 5 ) .",
    "we find that the formalism that depends on real spatial variables @xmath15 is simpler and more intuitive than working in @xmath9 space as was originally done in dkka ( their equations 7 - 10 , 13 and 15 ) .    in its most general form , equation ( [ eq : general ] )",
    "is not practical for modeling spectra .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath13 each have two functional degrees of freedom for a given @xmath14 .",
    "we need a simpler and testable model . to this end",
    ", we introduce the following simplifying assumptions and comment about their physical validity and plausibility .    1 .   @xmath16",
    "+ this is probably the weakest of our simplifications . for an accretion disk , it is probable that @xmath17 is a strong function of distance from the central source .",
    "moreover , there are at least two main emission sources at the wavelength range of the absorption troughs : continuum emission and broad emission line flux .",
    "these differ from each other greatly by their physical size and the emissivity as a function of wavelength ( see gabel et  al .",
    "2004 ) . nonetheless , it is essential to at least start with @xmath16 models in order to gain insight about absorption - trough formation in inhomogeneous media . 2 .",
    "@xmath18 + this simplifying assumption entails little loss of generality .",
    "we can think of @xmath19 as the integrated attenuated flux along a @xmath20 strip at a specific @xmath21 .",
    "3 .   @xmath22  or   @xmath23 + since there are infinite functional possibilities for the @xmath24 distribution , we limit our discussion to two simple and well - behaved functional forms .",
    "each of these functions depends on two free parameters .",
    "we also discuss a two parameter step function , which is the mathematical representation of the pure partial covering model .      using the above simplifications , we begin by examining simple monotonic distributions of optical depth in front of a one dimensional emission source . by construction",
    ", the emission source spans the interval @xmath25 and we assume that the surface brightness distribution is constant over this interval and given by @xmath16 ( see discussion above ) .",
    "finally , for simplicity we ignore the @xmath14 ( or velocity ) dependence of both @xmath26 and @xmath9 .",
    "we will examine the role of velocity dependence in   3 . to gain better understanding of the absorption behavior of such a medium",
    "we define the following parameters :    1 .",
    "@xmath27 , the average optical depth in front of the emission source .",
    "this is the relevant quantity for computing and comparing column densities ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "@xmath29 , the residual intensity of the transmitted flux ( normalized to 1 in the absence of absorption ) that an observer far from the absorber will measure .",
    "3 .   @xmath30 , apparent optical depth , which is the optical depth inferred from @xmath6 assuming a uniform absorbing slab that fully covers the emission source .",
    "this is the general case for ism and igm absorbers .",
    "@xmath31 , transmission parameter , measures the fraction of the emission source that is covered by @xmath32 . as we show below , for steep @xmath24 distributions @xmath33 .",
    "even more accurately , @xmath34 for two similar distributions with different @xmath35 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tau_dist ] we illustrate several monotonic absorbing - material distributions .",
    "the inset table displays some of the parameters defined above that are associated with these distributions . for calculating the transmitted residual flux @xmath6",
    ", we divided the emission zone into 1000 elements , calculated @xmath6 at each one according to the value of @xmath9 in front of it , summed all the contributions and normalized by the number of elements . to aid the visualization of such distributions",
    "we make the assumption that the number density of the absorbing ion @xmath36 is constant .",
    "this allows us to create simple geometrical illustrations of the absorbing - matter distribution , where the optical depth axis is proportional to the spatial depth of the absorber .",
    "we note that this assumption does not change the calculation of emergent flux , but in general will affect the conversion of optical depth to total column density .",
    "following dkka , for the power - law case we assume that @xmath37 , which reduces the number of free parameters to two : @xmath38 , the maximum optical depth in the distribution , and @xmath39 , the power - law exponent .",
    "although for power - law distributions dkka give closed form solutions for equation ( [ eq : general ] ) , these are expressed as the product of gamma functions and incomplete gamma functions ( see their eq . 13 ) , which are not particularly illuminating .",
    "we therefore rely solely on numerical results and attempt to clarify their origin and significance . to ease comparison with the power law case , the actual gaussian distribution plotted is @xmath40 ^ 2}$ ] , with no loss of generality .",
    "the amount of material in each distribution is given by @xmath35 , and the ratio @xmath41 can be interpreted as the amount of material `` hidden '' in the inhomogeneous absorber compared to what we naively deduce by using @xmath7 . as we show with real data ( see   4 ) , this ratio can become very large when attempting to fit doublet troughs with power - laws and gaussian distributions .",
    "for all plotted distributions we note the similarity in value between @xmath6 and @xmath31 . the plotted step function shows the inhomogeneous absorber representation of a pure partial covering .",
    "depending on which model we use for the absorber , the residual intensity in a single absorption trough can yield vastly different estimates for the optical depth that causes it . we know that the apparent optical depth method , which works so well for the ism and igm absorbers , is a very poor model for many agn outflows troughs , where @xmath42 gives only a lower limit for the real optical depth .",
    "this is evident when more troughs from the same ion are added as constraints on our absorbing model .",
    "several doublet lines commonly produce absorption troughs in the spectrum of agn outflows , the most notable are  @xmath31548.20,1550.77 ,  @xmath31238.82,1242.80 and  @xmath31031.93,1037.62 . these lines provide sufficient constraints to test the apparent optical depth method .",
    "for all the above doublets , the oscillator strength of the blue ( the shorter wavelength ) transition is exactly twice that of the red transition .",
    "therefore , the expected optical depth ratio is almost exactly 2:1 in favor of the blue transition .",
    "( it is not exactly 2:1 since the wavelengths differ by a small amount . ) for the apparent optical depth method to hold , we must have @xmath7(blue)=@xmath43(red ) which requires : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the residual intensities of the blue and red absorption troughs , respectively . for ism and igm absorber",
    "this relationship holds to an excellent degree ( arav et  al .",
    "in contrast , in most agn outflow troughs we find @xmath47 , instead we detect the whole range @xmath48 .",
    "( values outside this range are unphysical and usually can be attributed to the errors associated with the data [ hamann et  al .",
    "1997 ] . )    in order to explain the observed @xmath49 , the standard method is to invoke partial covering of the emission source . in its simplified form , we assume that the absorber covers only a portion @xmath8 ( which generaly depends on the velocity ) of a constant emission source ( at a given @xmath14 ) .",
    "we further assume that the @xmath9 distribution in front of the covered part of the source is constant . with these assumptions ,",
    "the absorption equations are : @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the velocity of the outflow , @xmath53 is the effective covering fraction ( see arav et al .",
    "1999b ) , and @xmath54 is the optical depth of the red doublet component .",
    "from these two equations we obtain : @xmath55 by construction , the partial covering model will always give a @xmath53 and @xmath54 solution to equations ( [ eq : covering1 ] ) and ( [ eq : covering2 ] ) , provided that @xmath49 . in order to test the validity of the model",
    "we must work with more than two lines from the same ion ( see gabel et  al.2004 ) .",
    "for the inhomogeneous absorber we need to test if , and under what conditions , the absorber satisfies the constraints imposed by doublet lines . in doing",
    "so we make use of and expand the simulation results derived by dkka , followed in the next section by applying these results to data of mrk 279 .",
    "to simulate doublet data , we start by computing the residual intensity for a given power - law distribution @xmath56 , thus obtaining @xmath57 .",
    "we define the red doublet residual intensity to be @xmath58 and obtain the blue doublet residual intensity , by using twice the @xmath38 value for the same distribution , @xmath59 . to obtain a meaningful comparison between different power - law ( @xmath39 ) distributions",
    "we convert the resulting @xmath57 to @xmath60 . apart from the last step ,",
    "this is the same procedure dkka used for producing their figure ( 2 ) . however , unlike dkka , we begin with looking at a single velocity position .",
    "this is done in order to gain better understanding for the formation of doublet troughs from inhomogeneous absorbers .",
    "we discuss the velocity dependency in the next section . following the power - law simulation we repeated the same procedure to produce doublet simulations from gaussian distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] shows the simulated results for two power law distributions , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the simulated @xmath46 and @xmath45 are displayed as well as @xmath63 .",
    "as discussed above , for a given @xmath46 the allowed physical range of @xmath45 is always between @xmath46 and @xmath63 , and it is important to keep in mind the narrowness of the physically allowed range when comparing power law fits to actual doublet data . also shown is @xmath64 where @xmath8 is the covering factor one would derive using the pure partial covering equations ( [ eq : doublet ] ) for the simulated @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "a common result from analyzing real data is that the @xmath64 curve is almost identical with @xmath45 . in the simulations ,",
    "we observe that for large enough @xmath35 ( roughly above 3 in both cases ) , @xmath64 is indeed almost identical with @xmath45 .",
    "as was found by dkka , we confirm that for a shallow power - law ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath64 is consistent with @xmath45 only for @xmath65 , and for a steep power - law ( @xmath62 ) @xmath64 is consistent with @xmath45 for @xmath66 .",
    "however , in the steep power - law case , it is difficult to obtain low values of @xmath45 . in the example shown , @xmath67 only at @xmath68 .",
    "the dashed curves show the ratio of @xmath69 ( read from the right axis ) , where @xmath70 is the optical depth derived by using the pure partial covering equations ( [ eq : doublet ] ) .",
    "this ratio is a good indicator for the amount of `` hidden '' column density in the inhomogeneous absorber compared to what we deduce from the pure partial covering model .",
    "we note that @xmath71 , therefore @xmath72 will be correspondingly larger .",
    "let us look at the mechanism which creates the simulated @xmath46 and @xmath45 for the steep power - law ( @xmath62 ) . this case is interesting since for a given @xmath9 , @xmath46 and @xmath45",
    "are quite close in value and @xmath73 is considerably smaller than @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "such a situation is often seen in real outflow data .",
    "the driver behind the finite yet small @xmath73 is closely related to the area of the absorber that is covered by small optical depth .",
    "for this purpose we defined the transmission parameter @xmath31 , which measures the fraction of the emission source that is covered by @xmath32 .",
    "we find that for steep power - laws , @xmath31 is almost identical with the residual intensity .",
    "for example , for @xmath76 and for @xmath77 . since the ratio of @xmath35 in these two examples is 2 , the residual intensities can be taken as @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( which is how figure [ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] was made ) .",
    "@xmath73 is almost fully attributed to @xmath80 , which suggests a simple geometrical interpretation : the residual intensities are mainly determined by the optically thin ( @xmath81 ) extent of the absorber over the emission source ( @xmath31 ) , and the difference in doublet intensities , @xmath73 , is almost entirely explained by the @xmath80 of the two distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av_gaussian ] shows the simulated results for two gaussian distributions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the additional dashed curves give @xmath84 and @xmath85 the transmission parameter for the red and blue troughs respectively .",
    "it is evident that i@xmath86t@xmath87 and i@xmath88t@xmath89 ( as is the case for steep power - law distributions ) . even for broader gaussians ( @xmath82 )",
    "this approximation is good to within 10%  20% across most of the @xmath35 range . comparing figures [ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] and [ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av_gaussian ]",
    "we see that there is little qualitative difference between the troughs produced by power - laws and gaussians .",
    "this is expected since the behavior of both functions in the @xmath90 region is quite similar for steep and high @xmath38 cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_dist ] ) .",
    "since the results of power - law and gaussian models are very similar , we will concentrate on power - laws in the rest of this paper .",
    "having @xmath73 small but finite at high @xmath35 is both a strength and a weakness for the inhomogeneous absorber model . in real high - quality data ,",
    "we often see occurrences that look like the lower panel of figure [ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] .",
    "that is , @xmath45 is close to , but distinctively smaller than @xmath46 while @xmath45 is considerably larger than @xmath91 ( the homogeneous full coverage absorber model ) .",
    "these occurrences are statistically difficult to explain using the pure partial coverage model ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : covering1 ] and [ eq : covering2 ] ) , where for @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "we are therefore left with the question of why in so many outflow absorbers , mother nature chose optical depth @xmath94 ( below @xmath95 it is difficult to distinguish between the homogeneous full coverage absorber and the pure partial coverage models . ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] , inhomogeneous absorber models can produce a small but finite @xmath73 at much higher @xmath35 values .",
    "the weakness is related to the observed examples of @xmath93 , which of course reverses the argument .",
    "@xmath93 is naturally explained as @xmath92 occurrences for the pure partial coverage model .",
    "however , the inhomogeneous power - law absorber models maintain a finite @xmath73 even at absurdly high values of @xmath35 .",
    "this point is strengthened by the fitting of  doublet troughs in the mrk 279 data (   5.2 ) .",
    "a related weakness of inhomogeneous power - law absorber models is their inability to create small values of @xmath96 for steep distributions ( e.g. , the @xmath62 example in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] ) and reasonable values of @xmath35 .",
    "shallow power - law distributions can do so but at the cost of having unrealistically large @xmath73 values . in the following section we will test these conjectures on real outflow data .",
    "on may 2003 we obtained simultaneous x - ray and uv observations of the mrk  279 agn outflow .",
    "( description of the uv observations is found in gabel et  al .",
    "2004 , and the x - ray observations in costantini et  al .  2004 . )",
    "the 92 ksec fuse data yielded the highest quality  trough - spectrum of any agn outflow to date , and the 16 orbits hst / stis / e140 m observation yielded high quality  troughs .",
    "the combined hst / fuse spectrum gives high signal - to - noise ,  and  troughs . in this section",
    "we use the inhomogeneous absorber formalism developed in the previous section to fit these data and check whether these simple distributions are an adequate model for real outflow troughs .    to fit the  and  troughs with inhomogeneous absorber models",
    "we start by normalizing the data , which is done by dividing the observed flux by an unabsorbed emission model . in doing so",
    "we implicitly assume that the inhomogeneous absorber has the same characteristics in front of both the continuum and bel sources .",
    "we then fit the red doublet data at each velocity bin as follows : we choose a power law value and using the formalism described in   2 iterate until a specific @xmath38 gives us the observed value of @xmath46 .",
    "we use the @xmath35 of this distribution when comparing with the optical depth @xmath70 derived from the doublet equations ( [ eq : doublet ] ) . following the procedure described in   3 , we double the fitted @xmath38 and take the residual intensity from the same distribution with @xmath97 as @xmath45 .",
    "this process is repeated for all the velocity bins in the trough .",
    "if the simulated @xmath45 curve for any given power - law index gives a good fit for the entire observed @xmath45 trough , we will have a strong indication that the material is indeed inhomogeneously distributed , with a specific power law .",
    "a similar fitting procedure is used for the lyman series troughs .      in figure [ fig_o6_a1_a4 ]",
    "we show the  fitting results for two power - law models .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath61 case gives a poor fit to the blue doublet - component data for most of the velocity range @xmath98 .",
    "this is mainly due to the inability of a shallow power law to produce @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] ) .",
    "a steeper power - law ( @xmath100 ) does a much better job in fitting the @xmath99 parts of the trough , but can not reproduce the regions where @xmath45 is roughly half way between @xmath46 and @xmath91 .",
    "the general behavior is shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig_o6_renorm ] , where we re - normalize the  data by dividing all the curves by @xmath46 . in this presentation @xmath101 and the behavior of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath46",
    "is made clearer .",
    "moreover , we can now examine four power - law models and better quantify their relationship to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we observe that the ratio @xmath102 is not constant and shows considerable structure .",
    "in contrast , for steep power - laws that give better overall fits to @xmath45 , the ratio of simulated @xmath102 is constant .",
    "these contrasting behaviors explain why steep power - law ( or narrow gaussian ) models do not provide a good fit for the entire @xmath45 trough .    however , the main problem with steep power - law ( or narrow gaussian ) models is the unrealistic high value of @xmath35 necessary to obtain the observed @xmath46 .",
    "this issue was already discussed in the simulation of doublet data (   3 ) . in the upper panel of figure [ fig_o6_renorm ]",
    "we show the @xmath35 curves for the models shown in figure [ fig_o6_a1_a4 ] and the lower panel of [ fig_o6_renorm ] .",
    "the steep power - law models ( @xmath103 ) , which provide a better fit for most of the observed trough , necessitate high @xmath35 .",
    "this behavior is an artifact of the need to have a steep power - law model with a small @xmath31 parameter .",
    "we conclude that simple power - law and gaussian distributions are hard pressed to fit the mrk  279 high - quality  trough data .",
    "the situation is quite different for the  troughs .",
    "figure [ fig_n5_a1 ] shows the fitting results for an @xmath61 power - law model that fit the data quite well . examining figure [ fig_n5_tau ]",
    "shows that power - law models with @xmath104 yield good fits except at @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , the inferred optical depth values are generally in good agreement with the doublet solution .",
    "the two exceptions are the expected departure at @xmath105  and at @xmath106 , where the doublet solution is suspect due to the shallowness of the absorption data .    we conclude that by themselves , the  troughs give support to simple inhomogeneous absorber models ( even for a model with a constant gradient ) . a reasonable fit",
    "is produced with only one velocity - dependent free parameter ( the optical depth ) , compared to the partial covering model that requires two free parameters at each velocity point ( optical depth and covering fraction ) .",
    "however , as we elaborate in the discussion , much of this result can be attributed to the lower real optical depth on the  troughs combined with the mathematical attributes of the power - law fits .",
    "a more stringent test for simple inhomogeneous absorber models is available by fitting the lyman series troughs . in the combined hst / fuse spectrum of mrk  279",
    "we have high - quality data for moderately deep troughs from ,  and .",
    "fitting three troughs from the same ion is far more constraining than fitting a doublet . for a doublet",
    ", we use one of the troughs as a baseline , that is , we construct the model to give it a perfect fit .",
    "the same model is than used to fit the other doublet component as described in   4.1 .",
    "a degree of freedom ( in our case the power - law exponent ) may very well suffice to fit the single remaining trough .",
    "for the three lyman series troughs , we fit  in the same way we fitted the red doublet component of  and , but now the same model has to fit both  and . to fit the  trough we take the derived @xmath38 ( ) and multiply it by the expected ratio of optical depths between  and : @xmath107 , where @xmath14 and @xmath108 are the wavelength and oscillator strength for each transition .",
    "we then use this value as @xmath38 ( ) for the same power law model in order to arrive at the expected  residual intensity .",
    "the procedure to fit  is similar .    as described in scott et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and gabel et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) the lyman series troughs are partially contaminated by non - outflow related absorption . only the absorption in the velocity range @xmath109",
    "is considered to be purely outflow related in the lyman series troughs , and therefore we only fit this region .",
    "the high ionization cno doublets are not affected by this unrelated absorption , which allows us to fit their entire profile . in figure [ lyman_series ]",
    "we show the fitting results for three power - law models .",
    "while the @xmath61 model gives a reasonable fit for the  data , it strongly over predicts the depth of the  trough . a steeper power law @xmath100 gives an adequate fit to the  trough , but greatly over predicts the depth of the  trough .",
    "a middle model ( @xmath110 ) gives unsatisfactory fits for both  and .",
    "it is clear that simple power - law inhomogeneous absorber models are not an adequate model for the lyman series outflow troughs in mrk  279 .",
    "in   4 we attempted to fit the outflow troughs of mrk  279 with simple power - law inhomogeneous absorber models .",
    "we demonstrated that the  troughs can not be fitted well with such models .",
    "the main reason for that was the small differences between @xmath45 and @xmath46 across most of the velocity profile .",
    "the extreme occurrence is in the velocity range @xmath111 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are indistinguishable within the noise limits .",
    "this part of the trough can only be fitted by inhomogeneous models that will closely resemble the step - function shown in figure  [ fig : tau_dist ] .",
    "therefore , the velocity range @xmath111 of the  troughs strongly supports the physical picture of the partial covering model and advocates for an optical depth distribution with a sharp edge .",
    "in contrast the  troughs were well - fitted by a simple inhomogeneous power - law absorber model . by itself",
    "this is quite a remarkable fit since we only let the optical depth vary as a function of velocity , where the partial covering model requires both the optical depth and the covering fraction to be velocity dependent free parameters .",
    "such a situation was found by dkka for the  troughs in balqso  1603 + 3002 .",
    "however , for the mrk  279 data similar models could not reasonably fit the  troughs nor the lyman series troughs .",
    "we should therefore look at the mathematical behavior of the power - law fits and see whether it can explain the goodness of the fit irrespectively of the actual physical model .",
    "we can attribute the success of the  fit to the fact that for these troughs @xmath45 is roughly in between @xmath46 and @xmath91 . as shown in figure  [",
    "fig : tau_doublet_tau_av ] , such occurrence with similar residual intensities can be reproduced by a shallow power - law model ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) that produces almost identical @xmath35 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is plausible that the good  fit is simply a result of the moderate optical depth for this ion .    as discussed in   4.3 ,",
    "the strongest constraints on simple inhomogeneous absorber models come from the attempt to fit the lyman series troughs . in this case",
    "it is evident that even allowing for complete freedom of both the power - law exponent and the optical depth as a function of velocity will not yield an acceptable fit .",
    "in contrast , partial covering models do yield good fits for the lyman series troughs ( gabel et  al .",
    "the success of partial covering models , combined with the failure of the inhomogeneous absorber models , suggest a sharp edge in the optical depth distribution across the source .",
    "we note that calculations of synthetic line profiles , based on wind models with the extended continuum source , support our notion of the optical depth distribution with a sharp edge ( e.g. , proga 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "partial covering models are equivalent to a step function distribution of optical depth across the absorber .",
    "mathematically , step functions , gaussians and a power - law distributions all have two free parameters .",
    "therefore , the comparison between the models stands on firm grounds .",
    "we conclude that monotonic inhomogeneous absorber models that do not include a sharp edge in the optical depth distribution across the source are not an adequate physical model to explain the trough formation mechanism for the outflow observed in mrk  279 .",
