    "mass gap generation and ( chiral ) symmetry breaking in relativistic fermionic systems can arise from a variety of mechanisms which are often related to certain couplings or interaction channels becoming dominant .",
    "an apparent counter - example is catalyzed symmetry breaking , first studied in the context of magnetic catalysis @xcite , where mass gap generation is triggered by the presence of a magnetic field even for arbitrarily small values of the interaction strength .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in various ways , the essence being that the long - range fluctuations driving the symmetry - breaking transitions are parametrically enhanced , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "more concretely , a magnetic field induces a fermionic fluctuation spectrum with landau - levels containing a zero mode that leads to an enhancement of the density of states in the ir and to an effective dimensional reduction favoring symmetry breaking .",
    "magnetic catalysis has found a rich variety of applications both in particle physics ( chiral phases of qcd ) @xcite and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "another simple picture for magnetic catalysis has recently been developed within the framework of the functional renormalization group in the context of the @xmath0 gross - neveu model @xcite . in line with the fact that symmetry - breaking phase transitions are often related to fixed points of renormalization group transformations",
    ", also magnetic catalysis can be related to the behavior of rg fixed points as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "this rg picture has already successfully been applied in the context of qcd @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we verify the underlying rg picture of catalyzed symmetry breaking in the context of curved spacetimes .",
    "the fact that symmetry breaking and mass generation in fermionic systems can be influenced by negative curvature of the spacetime has been realized early @xcite , and is meanwhile reviewed in textbooks @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is typically studied at mean - field level and occurs in many different fermionic models @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the similarity to magnetic catalysis was realized in terms of an effective dimensional reduction mechanism of the spectral properties of the dirac operator .",
    "this justifies the use of the terminology `` gravitational catalysis '' @xcite .    in fact , we find in the present work that the effective dimensional reduction and the corresponding enhancement of the density of states in the ir is directly related to the fixed point structure as identified below . from this rg viewpoint ,",
    "symmetry breaking arises as a consequence of the fact that the coupling value required for criticality becomes arbitrarily small as a function of the curvature ( the catalyzer ) .",
    "hence , any finite value of the fermionic interactions ultimately becomes supercritical , typically driving the system towards the ordered phase .",
    "we investigate this rg mechanism within the simple @xmath0 gross - neveu model in the present work .",
    "we concentrate on two different curved backgrounds with constant negative curvature : a maximally symmetric spacetime ( anti de sitter ) and a purely spatially curved case ( lobachevsky plane ) . for both cases ,",
    "mean - field studies are already available , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively . whereas the former allows for an analytic treatment in terms of simple functions ,",
    "the latter is potentially relevant for curved layered condensed matter systems .",
    "for instance , the exitonic or anti - ferromagnetic instabilities in graphite and graphene have been associated with quantum phase transitions falling into the @xmath0 gross - neveu universality class @xcite . as catalyzed symmetry breaking",

    ", @xmath191 can be viewed as a criticality condition @xcite , defining a scale @xmath192 , where the system becomes critical . for lower scale ,",
    "the system is driven towards the symmetry broken regime which is ultimately entered at @xmath193 defined above .",
    "the value of @xmath192 depends on the curvature as well as the initial coupling @xmath79 ( the latter is considered as initially subcritical here and in the following ) .",
    "the preceding discussion implicitly assumed that @xmath41 can run over all scales down to @xmath194 , such that the criticality condition can eventually always be satisfied .",
    "however , if , for instance , the system has a finite volume characterized by a finite length scale @xmath195 , also the fluctuation momenta are restricted , typically leading to an ir cutoff @xmath196 .",
    "one may think of a finite probe length , such as , e.g. , the size of a layer of graphene .",
    "this finite probe length @xmath195 can lead to a screening of the gravitationally catalyzed ordered regime if @xmath197 is larger than the would - be critical scale @xmath192 .",
    "hence , @xmath198 can be viewed as a lower bound for the coupling strength required for symmetry breaking in a real system of finite length .",
    "it thus generalizes the critical coupling at infinite volume and zero curvature to the situation of finite volume and finite curvature .",
    "it is instructive to study @xmath187 as a function of the length scale @xmath195 measured in units of a typical curvature length scale which we define by @xmath199 . for finite systems , this gives an estimate for how strongly a probe has to be curved in order to exhibit gravitational catalysis . in turn , for a given curvature of the probe , @xmath187 provides an estimate for the initial coupling strength required for symmetry breaking in the finite system .",
    "for instance , for the maximally symmetric case , we read off from eq .",
    "that @xmath200 for the spatially curved case , we incidentally find the same result in the limit of small curvature , i.e. , @xmath201 , using the expansion which is accurate even for values of @xmath202 .",
    "by contrast , the large curvature limit for the spatially curved case is different , cf .",
    ": @xmath203 from eq .",
    ", it is obvious that probe length to curvature ratios up to @xmath204 lead to pseudo - critical couplings @xmath187 which deviate from the zero - curvature critical coupling of the gross - neveu model only below the 1% level .",
    "significant deviations only occur for @xmath195 being an order of magnitude larger than the curvature scale @xmath205 . from the viewpoint of curvature - deformed condensed matter systems ,",
    "a ratio of @xmath204 appears to be `` large '' in the sense that ",
    "loosely speaking  a spatially curved @xmath206 planar probe embedded in @xmath0 euclidean space would rather look like a @xmath0 object .",
    "another way to interpret these results is the following : consider a finite - probe system with a subcritical bare coupling , @xmath207 , thus being in the symmetric ( e.g. semimetal ) phase . in order to gravitationally",
    "catalyze a transition to a broken ( gapped or insulating ) phase , the criticality condition has to be met for a sufficiently large @xmath208 . in view of eq .",
    "this requires comparatively strong curvature , i.e. , a small curvature length scale @xmath205 compared with the probe length @xmath195 .",
    "we have investigated the phenomenon of gravitational catalysis in the @xmath0 gross - neveu model on specific manifolds with constant negative curvature .",
    "while the mechanism had already been studied frequently with mean - field methods as well as from the viewpoint of the fluctuation spectrum of the dirac operator , we have added a new renormalization group picture to the comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "the essence of this picture is that the critical coupling of the fermionic system , corresponding to a quantum phase transition in flat spacetime , is transmuted into a scale - dependent pseudo - critical coupling that flows to zero as a consequence of long - wavelength fluctuations ( compared to the curvature scale ) . in this manner ,",
    "the infinite - volume fermion system becomes critical for any arbitrarily weak coupling .",
    "we have identified the rg ( pseudo- ) fixed point mechanism for two example manifolds of constant negative curvature : a maximally symmetric spacetime ( anti de sitter ) and a purely spatially curved case ( lobachevsky plane ) .",
    "both manifolds support the mechanism of gravitational catalysis , but exhibit a rather different behavior as far as the dependence of chiral symmetry breaking on the coupling and the curvature are concerned .",
    "the maximally symmetric case shows a linear dependence ( to leading order ) on both quantities which makes clear that the phenomenon is essentially perturbative , being reminiscent of the `` quantum anomaly '' for fermions in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "by contrast , order parameters indicating the symmetry broken state such as the induced fermion mass exhibit an essential singularity in both the coupling and the curvature for the case of the purely spatially curved case .",
    "this is in many respects similar to bcs - type gap formation .",
    "again , our renormalization group picture goes hand in hand here with properties of the fermionic fluctuation spectrum , as analyzed in @xcite .    as a benefit",
    ", the functional renormalization group also gives a simple access to systems of finite extent by identifying the rg infrared cutoff with an inverse length scale . in this manner",
    ", we can estimate the fate of gravitational catalysis in finite systems .",
    "in fact , the phenomenon only occurs , as long as the curvature radius is sufficiently small compared to the systems length scale .",
    "we have been able to phrase this statement quantitatively by introducing a pseudo - critical coupling .",
    "thinking in terms of curved layered condensed matter systems , rather large curvatures are needed compared to a realizable probe length in order to drive a sub - critical system into a phase dominated by gravitational catalysis .",
    "we would like to emphasize that an immediate application of our results to condensed matter systems would only be possible for reparametrization invariant systems such as fluid membranes @xcite , curvature effects of which can be mapped onto the language of riemannian geometry . for tethered membranes or general lattice systems , further phenomena connected to extrinsic curvature or curvature related defects can be become relevant .",
    "in this context , it is interesting to note that an external strain exerted on a graphene sheet in flat space induces a pseudo - magnetic field @xcite , that may also support ( pseudo-)magnetic catalysis . for such systems , we hence expect an interesting interplay between these various effects if we expose them to negative curvature inducing strain .",
    "finally , gravitational catalysis may become relevant in the context of asymptotically safe quantum gravity @xcite . in conjunction with fermionic degrees of freedom @xcite , the uv fixed point determining the shape of the universe at highest energies might go along with a negative ( though scale - dependent ) curvature @xcite . whether or not gravitational catalysis in connection with gravitionally modified critical fermion interactions @xcite could become active and impose constraints on the matter content of the universe",
    "then is a highly involved question that deserves to be investigated in greater depth .",

    "the dirac conjugate spinor @xmath209 is related to the hermitean conjugate of the spinor @xmath210 via the spin metric @xmath211 @xmath212 which is implicitly defined by @xmath213 this gives rise to the following properties of the building blocks of the gross - neveu action : @xmath214 choosing the spin metric @xmath211 to be anti - hermitean in eq .",
    "( i ) is convenient for our metric and clifford algebra conventions , but differs from @xcite . also , the absence of any imaginary factor of `` @xmath215 '' in the fermion kinetic term is due to these conventions .",
    "the flow equation uses a rather condensed notation .",
    "more concretely , we work in field space parameterized by the collective fields @xmath216 representing grassmann - valued functions on the manifold , reminiscent to nambu - gorkov spinors . for instance , the classical action amended by the regulator term which is used for deriving the flow equation from the functional integral ( cf .",

    "<S> catalyzed symmetry breaking arises from a parametric enhancement of critical fluctuations independently of the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry - breaking fermionic long - range fluctuations exhibit such an enhancement on negatively curved spaces , as is known from mean - field studies . </S>",
    "<S> we study gravitational catalysis from the viewpoint of the functional renormalization group using the @xmath0 gross - neveu model as a specific example . </S>",
    "<S> we observe gravitational catalysis towards a phase of broken discrete chiral symmetry both on a maximally symmetric ( ads ) and on a purely spatially curved manifold for constant negative curvature ( lobachevsky plane ) . the resulting picture for gravitational catalysis obtained from the renormalization flow is closely related to that of magnetic catalysis . </S>",
    "<S> as an application , we estimate the curvature required for subcritical systems of finite length to acquire a gravitionally catalyzed gap . </S>"
