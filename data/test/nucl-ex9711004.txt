    "these interactions , including annihilation of antiprotons in the spectrometer material , do not distort the shape of the measured transverse mass distributions but result in a reduction in the observed yields of about 11% for protons and 17% for antiprotons .",
    "the data are corrected for these losses .",
    "the invariant cross - sections , measured in the na44 acceptance , are generally well described by exponentials in transverse mass ( see equation [ eq : mt ] ) . the proton and antiproton rapidity densities ( dn / dy ) are calculated by integration of the normalized @xmath9 distributions , with the fitted coefficient of the exponent ( the ` inverse slope ' ) used to extrapolate to high @xmath9 , beyond the region of measurement .",

    "since the na44 spectrometer has acceptance for both positive and negative @xmath13 , a systematic offset in @xmath3 can be checked by requiring symmetry around @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting uncertainty on the origin of the @xmath3 scale is 7 mev / c for the 8  gev setting .",
    "a detailed monte carlo simulation , including multiple scattering and detector granularity , is used to correct for the finite resolution of the spectrometer , and introduces a systematic error in @xmath3 of 0.15% .",
    "systematic errors on the inverse slopes of the transverse mass distributions are estimated by comparing the inverse slope determined from the 131 mrad data to the inverse slope determined from both angle settings , and are less than 5%(15% ) for the 8  gev(4  gev ) setting data .",
    "the systematic errors due to the spectrometer acceptance correction are estimated from the sensitivity of the extracted slope to the fit range used , and by measuring the slope determined from the ratio of the cross - sections corresponding to the ` central ray ' of the spectrometer at both the 131 and 44 mrad settings . in this ratio",
    "the acceptance corrections cancel since the particles have the same path through the spectrometer .",
    "the total uncertainty is 10 mev / c for the mid - rapidity ( @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 ) data , and 10 - 20 mev / c for the lower rapidity ( @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 ) data .",
    "the error in the absolute normalizations is dominated by the uncertainty in the fraction of the total cross - section selected by the na44 centrality trigger , and by the pion and electron veto corrections .",
    "the relative error in the centrality is 6% for both the @xmath16 and @xmath17 data , resulting in a systematic uncertainty of 6% in dn / dy .",
    "for the proton - nucleus data , the trigger bias is determined by modeling the acceptance of the t@xmath5 counter , as described above .",
    "the resulting dn / dy values are sensitive to the charged particle distribution from the two models , giving an uncertainty of 1.5% for the @xmath0 data , increasing to 3% for @xmath18 .",
    "corrections for the fraction of events vetoed by pions are significant only for the sulphur - nucleus data at the 44 mrad setting .",
    "the uncertainties in these corrections are 10% for @xmath17 collisions and",
    "5% for @xmath16 collisions .",
    "additional errors on the dn / dy values arise from a 5% uncertainty in the determination of the data - acquisition live - time , and a 5% beam rate dependence of the pion veto correction for the @xmath17 data . for the @xmath12 data",
    ", there is an additional 6% error due to the correction for the efficiency of the interaction counter .",
    "the correction for non - target background contributes a negligible systematic error to the absolute cross - sections for proton - nucleus data .",
    "the total systematic errors on the measured inverse slopes and dn / dy values are given in table  [ tb : errors ] .",
    "weak decays of strange baryons are a significant source of protons and antiprotons , and contribute to the yields measured in the na44 spectrometer .",
    "a strange baryon may travel several centimeters from the target before decaying weakly to a proton and a pion .",
    "such a proton may be reconstructed in the spectrometer with the wrong momentum .",
    "the sensitivity of the data to this feed - down has been studied using a geant simulation of the spectrometer with particle distributions and yields taken from rqmd . of the strange baryons , only @xmath19 and @xmath20 decay weakly to protons ( with the corresponding antiparticles decaying to antiprotons ) .",
    "heavier strange baryons also contribute via sequential decays .",
    "the fraction of the measured protons ( antiprotons ) arising from these decays is calculated as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum within the na44 acceptance , and used to determine ` feed - down factors ' for the @xmath9 and dn / dy distributions .",
    "these are multiplicative factors which provide an estimate of the contribution of @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays to the measured distributions , and could be applied to the numbers in tables  [ tb : slope ] and [ tb : dndy ] to estimate the inverse slopes and yields of ` direct ' protons ( antiprotons ) .",
    "figure [ fg : rqmdfeed ] shows the effect of feed - down from weak decays on the rqmd proton and antiproton transverse mass distributions for @xmath17 collisions .",
    "including @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays tends to make the distributions steeper since the protons arising from weak decays contribute more at low @xmath3 .",
    "table  [ lamcor ] shows the feed - down factors for the inverse slopes and yields of the data due to @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays .",
    "the values are calculated using the @xmath23 and @xmath24 ratios from rqmd .",
    "the ` errors ' reflect the result of increasing and decreasing the @xmath25 ratio in the model by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "this factor of 1.5 is consistent with the scale of the discrepancies in the published data on @xmath21 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "for central @xmath16 collisions , rqmd is consistent with the @xmath23 ratio measured by na35 @xcite .",
    "however for @xmath17 , there is a factor of 2 discrepancy between the measurement of @xmath21 production by na36 @xcite and the scaled @xmath26 data of na35 .",
    "the rqmd prediction lies between the results of the two experiments .",

    "a factor of 1.5 variation in the ( @xmath30 ratio is also assumed in calculating the antiproton factors .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the feed - down factors is mainly determined by the experimental acceptance and not by the @xmath9 dependence of the ( @xmath28 ratio from rqmd .    as these factors necessarily contain some dependence on models they have not been applied to the data but are listed in table  [ lamcor ] so that the reader can appreciate the sensitivity of the data to @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays .",
    "the invariant cross - sections for protons and antiprotons from @xmath0 , @xmath29 , @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 collisions are shown in figures  [ fg : prot48 ] and [ fg : pbar48 ] as a function of @xmath9 - @xmath10 .",

    "the inverse slopes for antiprotons are generally somewhat lower than for protons at mid - rapidity , but are comparable in the backward rapidity interval .    the proton and antiproton rapidity densities ( dn / dy ) are listed in table  [ tb : dndy ] and plotted in figure  [ fg : dnvrqmd ] .",
    "proton yields increase with system size , and are significantly larger in nucleus - nucleus collisions than in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "more protons are produced in the backward rapidity interval ( @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 ) than at mid - rapidity ( @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 ) , particularly for proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "the antiproton yields are lower than the proton yields and grow less rapidly with increasing system size : the increase in the antiproton yield between @xmath0 and @xmath18 is less than 50% . comparing antiproton yields in the two rapidity intervals ,",
    "there is essentially no difference for proton - nucleus collisions . in nucleus - nucleus collisions however , antiproton production is notably smaller backwards of mid - rapidity .    figure  [ fg : ratio ] shows the ratio of @xmath33 to @xmath34 yields for the various projectile - target systems .",
    "note that the systematic errors described in table  [ tb : errors ] cancel in this ratio .",
    "the @xmath35 ratio decreases by a factor of 4 from @xmath0 to @xmath17 .",
    "most of this decrease with system size occurs between @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",

    "the energy dependence of proton and antiproton production in @xmath1 collisions has been studied at the isr @xcite . using the parametrizations of the proton and antiproton cross - sections as a function of center - of - mass energy from @xcite , the effect of the different beam momenta for the @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath36 data on the systematic behaviour of the @xmath35 ratio can be estimated . decreasing the beam momentum from 450 to 200 gev / c per nucleon",
    ", this energy scaling implies that the @xmath33 yield decreases by @xmath37 and the @xmath34 yield decreases by @xmath38 .",
    "thus the decrease in beam energy can not explain the decrease of the @xmath35 ratio .",
    "rather it reflects the fact that at mid - rapidity most protons are not produced but originate from the target or projectile .    in order to study the centrality dependence of proton and antiproton production ,",
    "the @xmath17 data are divided into two subsamples containing the 11 - 6% and 6 - 0% most central collisions respectively .",
    "the inverse slopes show no centrality dependence between the two subsamples .",
    "figure [ spbvcent ] shows the proton and antiproton yields for these two different centrality selections .",
    "production of both protons and antiprotons increases with centrality , although the yield of protons rises faster .",
    "the precision of the data and the range of the systems studied provide strong constraints on models of proton and antiproton production , rescattering and annihilation .",
    "we have compared our data in detail to the rqmd model .",
    "figure  [ fg : spbvrqmd ] compares the transverse mass distributions of protons and antiprotons from @xmath17 collisions to predictions from rqmd with and without rope formation .",
    "the contribution of feed - down from @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays is included in the model predictions , determined using the geant simulation described above .",
    "the shapes of the spectra are generally reproduced by the model .",
    "this is true also for the lighter collision systems .",
    "the rqmd distributions are then used to determine inverse slopes and yields from the model in the same way as for the data .    comparing different collision systems , the inverse slopes of both protons and antiprotons increase with system size .",
    "the relative increase , from @xmath0 to @xmath17 , is similar in both cases .",
    "na44 has previously reported an increase in the inverse slopes of kaons , protons and antiprotons produced at mid - rapidity in symmetric collision systems @xcite .",
    "these data extend this trend to asymmetric systems , and to more backward rapidities ( @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 ) . for symmetric systems , the inverse slopes of protons and antiprotons are equal , while for the asymmetric systems @xmath39 and @xmath17 at @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 the inverse slopes of protons are higher than those of antiprotons .",
    "the increase of the proton inverse slope with system size , which continues through @xmath40 collisions @xcite , is a result of the increasing number of produced particles and consequent rescattering .",
    "the large number of secondary collisions causes the hadronic system to expand @xcite , and the velocity boost from this collective expansion is visible as an increased inverse slope in the proton @xmath9 distributions .",
    "one would expect this effect to be concentrated at mid - rapidity , and this is supported by the data which show that the inverse slopes of protons are higher at @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 than at @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 .",
    "though the antiproton inverse slope is also increased by secondary collisions , the rqmd model predicts that the observed antiprotons have suffered fewer rescatterings than the observed protons .",
    "this is because secondary collisions with baryons can annihilate the antiprotons , and the number of baryons at mid - rapidity in the nucleus - nucleus collisions is substantial @xcite .",
    "this may explain why the inverse slopes of antiprotons do not increase from @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 to @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 .",
    "rqmd reproduces the trend of increasing inverse slope with system size ( table  [ tb : slope ] and figure  [ fg : tvrqmd ] ) , and is in reasonable agreement on the absolute values of the inverse slopes , with the exception of the backward rapidity ( @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 ) protons from sulphur - nucleus collisions , where the model predicts larger inverse slopes than are measured experimentally . for @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 ,",
    "the rqmd proton distributions tend to deviate from exponentials in transverse mass , showing larger inverse slopes at low @xmath41 ( within the na44 acceptance ) than at high @xmath41 . for rqmd , there is no significant difference in the inverse slopes if rope formation is turned off .",
    "this might seem surprising for antiprotons since if rope formation is included , almost all antiprotons originate from ropes , and the production mechanisms of antiprotons from ropes and from conventional sources are very different .",
    "however , rescattering would tend to mask any difference in the initial @xmath9 distribution of antiprotons produced from either ropes or conventional sources .",
    "the yields of protons and antiprotons both increase with system size , the proton yield rising faster .",
    "the increase of both yields and inverse slopes with target size is much stronger in @xmath11 than in @xmath12 collisions since target nucleons may be struck by more than one projectile nucleon .",
    "the @xmath35 ratio decreases with system size , and is lower towards target rapidity than at mid - rapidity .",
    "this implies that most of the protons at mid - rapidity are not produced in the collision , but are remnants of the initial nuclei .",
    "the fraction and absolute numbers of such ` original ' protons decreases from @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 to @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 , indicating that the stopping of protons at these energies is incomplete . for @xmath12 collisions ,",
    "the antiproton yield is essentially constant from @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 to @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 , whereas for @xmath11 collisions more antiprotons are produced at @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 .    for the @xmath11 data , no change in the inverse slopes of protons and antiprotons with centrality is seen within the 11% most central @xmath17 , and 8% most central @xmath16 , collisions .",
    "both proton and antiproton yields increase with centrality . the increase is larger for protons than for antiprotons , and",
    "both particles show a larger increase at @xmath15=2.3 - 2.9 than at @xmath15=1.9 - 2.3 .",
    "rqmd predictions for proton and antiproton yields , with and without color ropes , are shown in table  [ tb : rqmddndy ] and figure  [ fg : dnvrqmd ] .",
    "the proton yields are generally well described by the model in both @xmath12 and @xmath11 collisions , although there is a tendency for rqmd to overpredict the yield in the more backward rapidity interval for sulphur - nucleus collisions .",
    "antiproton yields from @xmath12 collisions are also in reasonable agreement with rqmd , however the data show a somewhat weaker target dependence than the model .",
    "the antiproton yield in @xmath16 collisions is consistent with the rqmd prediction without ropes , whereas the @xmath17 yield is between the rope and no - rope predictions . with no rope formation ,",
    "it is possible that rqmd could reproduce the observed @xmath11 antiproton yields with a smaller annihilation cross - section in the model . if , however , the rope hypothesis is valid , then either rqmd overpredicts antiproton production in nucleus - nucleus collisions , or it underpredicts the subsequent annihilation of the produced antiprotons in the surrounding medium .",
    "preliminary results from na44 on the @xmath42 yields near mid - rapidity ( @xmath15=3.0 - 4.0 ) show that the pion yield increases by a factor of 36 @xmath2 4 from @xmath0 to @xmath17 while the proton and antiproton yields increase by factors of 75 @xmath2 4 and 20 @xmath2 2 respectively .",
    "the fact that antiproton production increases less rapidly with system size than pion production naively suggests that the antiproton yield from @xmath17 collisions may be lowered because of annihilation .    na35 has published data on `` net protons '' ( i.e. the difference between protons and antiprotons ) and antiprotons for @xmath29 , @xmath43 , @xmath16 ( 3% most central ) and @xmath44 ( 6% most central ) collisions @xcite . in those cases for which comparison data are available",

    "figure  [ na44v35 ] shows a comparison of the rapidity densities for net protons and antiprotons from na44 and na35 .",
    "there is good agreement between the two experiments .",
    "these data constitute the first systematic measurement of proton and antiproton yields and spectra from @xmath0 to @xmath17 .",
    "the stopping of protons is incomplete at 200gev / a . for @xmath11 collisions ,",
    "target nucleons tend to be struck by more than one projectile nucleon : this causes the target dependence of the inverse slopes and yields to be stronger in @xmath11 than in @xmath12 collisions . as the size of the system increases , the increasing density of particles at mid - rapidity causes the protons to recscatter more often and so their mean @xmath9 , or inverse slope , increases .",
    "this mechanism is less efficient for antiprotons since they may annihilate when they rescatter . in spite of annihilation ,",
    "the yield of antiprotons increases with system size and centrality : this increase is strongest at mid - rapidity .",
