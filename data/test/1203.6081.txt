    "as the nearest large spiral galaxy , m31 is a fundamental benchmark for studies of disk galaxy evolution , and our understanding of the evolution of m31 has changed profoundly during the past decade . there is a large body of evidence ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2001 , 2007 ; hammer et al . 2007 ; tanaka et al . 2010 ) that interactions with companion galaxies , some of which may not have survived intact to the present day and remain only as debris trails , have occured throughout the history of m31 .",
    "the detection of similar tidal features close to other nearby galaxies ( e.g. martinez - delgado et al . 2010 ) indicates that galaxy - galaxy encounters in the local universe have not been rare , and have played a key role in sculpting the current appearance of many nearby galaxies .",
    "the current study focuses on investigating the star - forming history ( sfh ) of m31 during the past few hundred myr , using the brightest resolved stars as tracers .",
    "it has been suggested that m31 has interacted with some of its companions during this time , and a key element of our work is to search for observational signatures of this activity .",
    "a review that considers the entire history of m31 will guide our understanding of its present - day appearance , and allow a conceptual picture of the key events that shaped its evolution to be developed . to this end , in the remainder of this section we review previous work on the evolution of m31 . while current theories for the buildup of disk galaxies give primacy to the smooth accretion of hot and cold gas , the following focuses on the influence of major and minor mergers , as these imprint observable signatures on the kinematics , spatial distribution , and age distribution of stars .",
    "not every interaction can be traced in detail , especially those that happened more than a few dynamical times in the past , and the discussion of the earliest phases of the evolution of m31 are  by necessity  more speculative than the discussion of the most recent events .",
    "the ages listed in what follows should also be viewed as approximations .",
    "the initial assembly of m31 likely involved the merger of proto - galactic structures , which contained a mix of gas and stars that had formed _ in situ _",
    "( e.g. oser et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the gas in these structures probably contributed to the assembly of an m31 proto - disk , supplementing material accreted through the large - scale inflow of hot and cold gas .",
    "any early disk was likely short - lived due to the high frequency of major mergers .",
    "in addition to disrupting the early disk , mergers may also have spurred the formation of a classical metal - poor halo , through the displacement of stars out of the disk plane .",
    "stars ejected in such events are expected to dominate the central 20 kpc of halos ( zolotov et al .",
    "2009 ) . at larger radii the majority of halo stars",
    "may not have had such a violent origin , and may instead have been accreted from companion galaxies during the first few gyr of galaxy assembly ( font et al .",
    "2008 ; zolotov et al .",
    "2009 ; cooper et al . 2010 ) .",
    "a classical metal - poor halo has been detected around m31 ( e.g. kalirai et al .",
    "2006 ; chapman et al 2006 ; ibata et al . 2007 ; koch et al . 2008 ) .",
    "there is evidence that m31 accreted a number of satellites early - on .",
    "the integrated luminosities , masses ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) , and dynamical properties of the m31 and the galactic halos are similar ( chapman et al .",
    "2006 ; ibata et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the properties of galactic globular clusters suggest that 6  8 satellites large enough to form such large star clusters may have been accreted ( e.g. mackey & gilmore 2004 ; forbes & bridges 2010 ) .",
    "globular clusters in the m31 halo tend to be associated with tidal debris ( mackey et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the range of ages , chemical mixtures , and overall metallicities amongst m31 clusters ( e.g. beasley et al . 2005 ) hints at diverse progenitors .",
    "some objects that were originally identified as globular clusters may not be simple stellar populations ( ssps ) ( e.g. davidge et al . 1990 ; meylan et al .",
    "2001 , fuentes - carrera et al . 2008 ) , but instead may be the remnants of dwarf galaxies that were shredded early in the evolution of m31 ( fuentes - carrera et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the properties of classical globular clusters suggest that m31 and the galaxy may have experienced different chemical enrichment histories early - on .",
    "when compared with galactic globular clusters , the spectra of many m31 globular clusters have relatively strong cn absorption bands ( e.g. burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; davidge 1990a ) , and this has been attributed to a comparatively large nitrogen abundance in m31 clusters ( burstein et al .",
    "such an abundance difference may have its origins in the numbers of present - day stars in globular clusters that formed in the diffuse proto - cluster environments , as opposed to those that formed in the more compact potential wells that existed after cluster formation ( carretta et al .",
    "2010 ) , in the sense that m31 clusters are made up of a smaller fraction of progenitor stars .",
    "if correct , then the location of stars in m31 globular clusters on the [ na / fe ] versus [ o / fe ] diagram , which is a diagnostic of the rate of chemical enrichment , should differ from that defined by galactic objects .",
    "early merger activity likely also produced a pressure - supported bulge ( e.g. bekki & chiba 2001 ) . aside from the central few arcsec , the integrated spectrum of the m31 bulge at visible wavelengths originates predominantly from old stars ( e.g. davidge 1997 ; puzia et al .",
    "2005 ; saglia et al .",
    "the brightest agb stars are well - mixed throughout the central @xmath8 kpc of the m31 bulge , as expected if they formed during a rapid , uniform star - forming episode ( davidge 2001b ) , such as would result from the violent merging of satellites . still , the structural ( e.g. beaton et al . 2007 ) and kinematic ( e.g. morrison et al .",
    "2010 ) properties of the m31 bulge suggest that secular processes may have also contributed to its growth .",
    "the material from which stars in the galactic bulge formed may have been chemically enriched by the earliest generation of globular clusters ( davidge 2001a ) .",
    "if globular clusters did play a significant role in enriching the early ism of m31 then the chemical properties of stars in the bulge and globular clusters may show similarities .",
    "in fact , the strengths of cn absorption bands at visible wavelengths in the integrated spectrum of the inner bulge of m31 are reminiscent of those in m31 globular clusters ( davidge 1997 ) , suggesting a chemical kinship .    a thick disk may also have been formed during the early assembly of m31 . using kinematic selection criteria , collins et al . ( 2011 )",
    "detect a thick disk in m31 and find that the component stars are @xmath9 dex more metal - poor than thin disk stars at the same galactic radius .",
    "the estimated total mass of the thick disk suggests that it did not form from the destruction of a satellite that follows the trend between [ m / h ] and total mass defined by present - day systems .",
    "if the m31 thick disk formed from thin disk stars that were kinematically heated then its ( comparatively ) low metallicity suggests that this happened during early epochs , before the major merger that produced the extended extraplanar component discussed in the next section .",
    "the spatial extent of m31 at the end of its initial assembly was significantly smaller than the present - day galaxy .",
    "simulations suggest that a galaxy with a present - day mass like that of m31 probably accreted no more than one - half of this mass by moderate redshifts ( stewart et al .",
    "2008 ) , while at @xmath10 the spatial extent of its disk may have been substantially ( by a factor of @xmath11 two - thirds ) smaller than its present - day value ( firmani & avila - reese 2009 ) . the modest size of the m31 progenitor aside , it was this system that served as the seed for the subsequent evolution that lead to the present - day galaxy .",
    "mergers were common events during intermediate epochs , and played a key role in sculpting the morphological properties of nearby disk galaxies ( hammer et al . 2007 ; 2009 ; van der kruit & freeman 2011 ) . simulations of a merger between a disk galaxy and a large companion find that the existing disk can be obliterated , with the orbits of disk stars thermalising to form a pressure - supported extraplanar population ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "a gas disk will re - form if the progenitors have sufficient quanities of gas ( robertson et al .",
    "2006 ; governato et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "there is evidence that a violent merger occured only a few gyr following the initial assembly of m31 .",
    "such an event would have profoundly affected the morphology of m31 , and may have produced features that are usually attributed to more recent interactions ( hammer et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the proposed merger heated the disk of m31 and produced a diffuse extraplanar component that is distinct from the classical metal - poor halo .",
    "it has long been known that the extraplanar regions of m31 are dominated by stars with metallicities that ( 1 ) are much higher than those in the galactic halo ( e.g. mould & kristian 1986 , pritchet & van den bergh 1988 , durrell et al .",
    "2001 ) and ( 2 ) are consistent with an origin in either a large disk or an smc / lmc - like companion .",
    "more recently , a kinematically hot component ( e.g. chapman et al . 2006 ; gilbert et al .",
    "2007 ) has been detected , that has been traced out to extraplanar distances of 60 kpc .",
    "this component is distinct from the thick disk , which has a vertical scale height of 3 kpc ( collins et al .",
    "the metallicities of stars in this component show little or no trend with distance from the galaxy ( chapman et al .",
    "2006 ; koch et al . 2008",
    "; richardson et al . 2009 ) .",
    "a break in the surface brightness profile occurs near 30 kpc ( ibata et al .",
    "2007 ) , possibly indicating the transition between a violently disturbed inner halo and a more metal - poor classical halo .",
    "the lack of sub - structure in the distribution of the moderately metal - rich extraplanar stars suggests that they are not the remnants of a galaxy that was slowly accreted by m31 , but instead are the result of a kinematically violent event .",
    "the extraplanar component must have an age of at least a few gyr , as the c / m5 + ratio is @xmath12 throughout the outer regions of m31 ( koch & rich 2010 ) .",
    "such a c star frequency amongst stars with a moderately sub - solar metallicity is suggestive of an age in excess of @xmath13 gyr ( e.g. cole & weinberg 2002 ) .",
    "brown et al . ( 2008 ) discuss observations of extraplanar fields with minor axis distances of 21 and 35 kpc , which are populated by stars with main sequence turn - off ( msto ) ages @xmath14 gyr .",
    "the age distribution is such that the majority of stars in the 35 kpc field are not associated with the early assembly of m31 , as only 10% are extremely old and metal - poor and so likely belong to the classical halo . that the bulk of the stars in the two brown et al .",
    "( 2008 ) fields have ages @xmath15 gyr argues that ( 1 ) the merger occured a few gyr after the initial assembly of m31 , and ( 2 ) there has not been a subsequent merger of comparable magnitude  while m31 has likely been subject to encounters with other galaxies in the more recent past ( see below ) , none of these have been as disruptive as the event described here .",
    "a sfr for m31 during this epoch can be estimated from the relation between the brightness of the brightest globular cluster , normalized to an age of 10 myr , and sfr .",
    "the most luminous globular cluster that is known to have formed during intermediate epochs is 292 - 010 , for which beasley et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find a mass of @xmath16 m@xmath7 .",
    "the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) indicate that log(m / l)@xmath17 for a population with an age 10 myr , and so 292 - 010 would have had m@xmath18 when it was 10 myr old . applying relation 1 from bastian ( 2008 ) yields a sfr of @xmath19 m@xmath7 year@xmath20 .",
    "major mergers trigger large - scale star - forming activity that is not restricted to the central regions of the galaxy ( e.g. teyssier et al .",
    "2010 ) , and m31 may have appeared as an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) for a period of time during intermediate epochs .",
    "star formation is seen throughout the disks of ulirgs , and is curtailed at progressively smaller radii as torques cause gas to move inwards ( e.g. soto & martin 2010 ) .",
    "if m31 was a typical ulirg then 5  10% of its current stellar mass may have been produced over a @xmath21 gyr ( marcillac et al .",
    "2006 ) time span , and this is roughly consistent with the sfr estimated above from the brightest intermediate age globular cluster .    the formation of globular clusters in the local universe is associated with the large - scale re - distribution of gas that occurs during major mergers ( e.g. whitmore et al . 1993 ) , and the concomitant violent turbulent stirring of the ism that produces dense star - forming clumps ( teyssier et al .",
    "globular clusters in m31 span a wide range of ages ( e.g. beasley et al .",
    "2004 ; burstein et al .",
    "2004 ; fusi pecci et al . 2005 ; caldwell et al .",
    "2009 ) , and puzia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find peaks in the cluster age distribution at @xmath22 gyr , 8 gyr , and 1 gyr .",
    "the majority of globular clusters in m31 belong to the oldest age group , which is associated with the initial assembly of the galaxy . however , the number of clusters that belong to the 8 gyr peak  and which likely formed during the major merger that produced the extraplanar component  is a significant fraction of the older cluster system .",
    "these intermediate age clusters tend to be seen against the disk of the galaxy , and are not at large radii . to the extent that globular clusters are probes of a disturbed and turbulent ism , the 8",
    "gyr cluster population is the remnant of an event that was almost as violent as the mergers associated with the initial assembly of m31",
    ".    a major merger would have imprinted signatures on the age distribution of stars throughout much of the disk . if the present - day disk of m31 formed during intermediate epochs following the obliteration of an earlier disk then there should be ( 1 ) an absence of disk stars with ages @xmath15 gyr , and ( 2 ) a large population of disk stars that formed @xmath23 gyr in the past - these are the field counterpart of the globular cluster population that formed at that time .",
    "in addition , starbursts deplete the gas supply at a rate that is an order of magnitude shorter than in a normal disk ( daddi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , the sfr would have plunged within a few disk rotation times of the merger .",
    "observations that fully test these predictions require photometric depths and angular resolutions that tax the capabilities of existing telescopes . still , olsen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) investigate the sfh of bulge and disk fields in m31 , and find a preponderance of stars with ages @xmath14 gyr .",
    "this is consistent with the disk of m31 experiencing a large burst of star formation in the past that may not have been associated with the epoch of earliest disk assembly .",
    "m31 has not evolved in isolation since the major merger that spurred the formation of the present - day thin disk , and there is a high probability that there was a close encounter between m31 and m33 within the past few gyr .",
    "various studies have estimated when such an interaction may have occured .",
    "the sfh of m33 suggests that the encounter must have happened at least 0.5 gyr in the past ( davidge & puzia 2011 ) .",
    "using the locations and velocities of m31 and m33 , putman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argues that an encounter occured 1  3 gyr in the past , while bekki ( 2008 ) assigns an age of 4  8 gyr based on the properties of the hi bridge that may link the galaxies ( braun & thilker 2004 ) .",
    "simulations discussed by mcconnachie et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that use currently available orbital constraints and the assumption that m33 was significantly perturbed by the encounter place this interaction a few billion years in the past .",
    "there is a high probability that the tidal radius of m33 was @xmath24 kpc during this encounter , and this would have disturbed the disk of m33 .",
    "the s - shaped hi distribution in the outer regions of m33 is testiment of such a disturbance , and this structure likely contains gas that was stripped from the m33 disk ( putman et al .",
    "the detection of extended stellar structures in the outer regions of the m33 disk , coupled with isophotal distortions at smaller radii , provide further evidence that the disk of m33 was disturbed ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2010 ; davidge & puzia 2011 ) .",
    "the disk of m31 would also have been affected by this event ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2009 ; davidge & puzia 2011 ) , with elevated levels of star - forming activity being sparked as tidal forces re - distributed gas .",
    "intermediate age globular clusters in m31 with ages @xmath25 gyr ( puzia et al .",
    "2005 ) may have formed during this event .",
    "while the sfr of the m31 disk would have been greatly elevated immediately after the encounter , it would eventually drop as the ism is depleted and disrupted .",
    "there is evidence of a decrease in m31 star - forming activity @xmath8 gyr ago ( williams 2002 ) .",
    "given that the damping timescale for elevated sfrs is on the order of a few disk crossing times , then the drop in the sfr found by williams ( 2002 ) is consistent with an interaction that had peak star - forming activity @xmath25 gyr ago .",
    "if gas was re - distributed throughout m31 then intense star - forming activity would likely have been triggered in the galaxy center , and this part of m31 _ does _ contain stars that formed at a time that coincides with the proposed interaction with m33 .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the central few arcsec of m31 at visible wavelengths reveals a large population of objects with an age of a few gyr ( davidge 1997 ; silchenko et al .",
    "saglia et al .",

    "mergers and interactions with companions that have @xmath27 the mass of the primary galaxy are not expected to permanently disrupt disks ( e.g. stewart et al .",
    "2008 ) , and there is evidence that m31 has interacted with companions in this mass range during recent epochs . the most overt signature of such an encounter may be the giant stellar stream ( gss ; ibata et al .",

    "the extraplanar regions of m31 are laced with stellar streams and tidal structures , some of which may or may not be related to the gss .",
    "the completeness of the catalog of these structures is uncertain , as there is a bias against the detection of metal - poor and/or old features .",

    "such comprehensive spatial coverage is of interest since the sfh can vary with location over large spatial scales in disks ( e.g. davidge 2010 ; davidge & puzia 2011 ) . spatial variations of this nature can complicate efforts ( 1 ) to determine a representative global sfh if only part of the disk is sampled , and ( 2 ) to assess the large scale radial trends that are probes of galaxy evolution .",
    "two important considerations are the distance to m31 and the reddening model .",
    "an absolute distance modulus @xmath38 , computed by vilardell et al . (",
    "2010 ) from two double - lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries , is adopted for this study .",
    "such systems are primary distance indicators ( de vaucouleurs 1978 ) , that rely on geometric parameters directly measured from the application of basic physics .",
    "distances measured with these objects should be less susceptible to calibration uncertainties than those computed from secondary distance indicators .",
    "the distance modulus adopted here is in excellent agreement with that computed from cepheids by riess et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "the baseline reddening model consists of a linear combination of foreground ( a@xmath39 ; schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) and internal ( a@xmath40 ; pierce & tully 1992 ) components .",
    "the total extinction is thus a@xmath41 magnitudes .",
    "this corresponds to a@xmath42 , a@xmath43 , and a@xmath44 magnitudes , based on the relations listed in table 6 of schlegel et al .",
    "it is demonstrated in  4 that this total extinction holds for a ` typical ' main sequence star in our sample . of course , the reddening towards any given object depends on factors such as its age , location , and evolutionary state ( e.g. massey et al . 2009 ) , and it is not surprising that there is a substantial spread in extinction throughout the m31 disk .",
    "for example , hodge et al . (",
    "2010 ) find a dispersion of @xmath45 mag in @xmath46 measurements among young clusters .",

    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the observations and the reduction of the data are discussed in  2 , while details of the photometric measurements , including their calibration and characterization , are discussed in  3 .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are presented in  4 , while the sfh of the m31 disk is investigated in  5 using the lfs of main sequence stars .",
    "the spatial distribution of main sequence and evolved stars is examined in  6 .",
    "the paper closes with a summary and discussion of the results in  7 .",
    "the data were recorded on the 3.6 metre cfht as part of the 2010b megacam ( boulade et al .",
    "2003 ) observing queue .",
    "the detector in megacam is a mosaic of thirty six @xmath51 e2v ccds .",
    "these are deployed in a @xmath52 format , and cover roughly one degree@xmath36 exposure@xmath20 with 0.185 arcsec pixel@xmath20 .",
    "four fields that cover almost all of the star - forming disk of m31 were imaged through @xmath53 , and @xmath54 filters . the locations of the megacam pointings are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the observations for each field were obtained during a single continuous block of time , that typically spanned 2 hours . while archival @xmath55 and @xmath54 megacam data were available of the disk of m31 , images in these filters were still recorded for our program to secure a set of single epoch measurements , and thereby suppress scatter in colors that might arise from photometric variability over timescales @xmath56 hours .",
    "a log of the observations , showing dates of observations and exposure times for each field , is shown in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath57 images have markedly longer exposure times than the @xmath55 and @xmath54 images because of the comparatively low system throughput at shorter wavelengths",
    ".    initial processing of the data was done with the cfht elixir pipeline , and this included bias subtraction and flat - fielding .",
    "each pipeline - processed image was divided into six @xmath58 ccd sub - mosaics to produce datasets of a manageable size for subsequent processing and photometric analysis .",
    "sub - mosaic images were spatially registered to correct for offsets introduced during acquisition , and the results were stacked according to field and filter .",
    "the megacam optics produce modest chromatic distortions across the imaged field , which manifest as location - dependent offsets between the centroids of stars imaged in different filters",
    ". the offsets between @xmath57 and @xmath55 images taken at moderate airmass and aligned near the optical axis of the instrument can be up to an arcsec near the edge of the megacam science field . to correct for these , the @xmath57 and @xmath54 data were mapped into the @xmath55 reference frame using the iraf geomap / geotran tasks .",
    "stars in the final distortion - corrected images typically have fwhm @xmath59 arcsec .",
    "photometric measurements were made with the point spread function ( psf)-fitting program allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "each psf was constructed from between 50 to 100 bright , unsaturated stars using routines in the daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "in addition to brightness , psf stars were selected using star - like appearance and the absence of bright neighbors as criteria .",
    "faint companions were subtracted from the wings of psf stars in an iterative manner , using progressively improved psfs .    following the procedure described by davidge ( 2010 ) , the raw photometric catalogues produced by allstar were culled of extended and very faint sources using the error in magnitude that is computed by allstar , @xmath60 .",
    "this quantity measures the quality of the psf fit , but does not take into account other sources of error , such as those introduced by crowding . while @xmath60 is only a lower limit to the total uncertainty in source brightness , it provides a means of identifying objects for which photometry may be problematic .",
    "two rejection criteria were applied .",
    "first , all sources with @xmath61 mag were deleted .",
    "obtaining meaningful photometric measurements is problematic for objects with such large uncertainties , the majority of which are near the faint limit of the data .",
    "second , point sources define a sequence in the magnitude _ vs. _",
    "@xmath60 plane that is narrow at the bright end and fans out towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "objects that are outliers from this trend were removed .",
    "this step tends to remove extended sources ( e.g. davidge 2010 ) and cosmetic defects .",
    "standard stars are observed during each megacam observing block .",
    "these observations are used to determine photometric zeropoints , and the results are placed in megacam image headers during elixir processing .",
    "we used these header entries to transform instrumental magnitudes into the sloan digital sky survey @xmath62 system ( fukugita et al .",
    "we note that a comparison of photometric measurements in overlapping sections of fields indicates that the internal field - to - field calibration consistency is a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "there are significant differences between the @xmath57 and @xmath63 bandpasses , with the central wavelength of @xmath57 falling 200  redward of @xmath63 .",
    "our @xmath63 magnitudes were checked using the @xmath64 measurements of bright stars in m31 published by massey et al .",
    "the magnitudes from that study were transformed into the sloan system using equations from smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and the results were compared for stars in common with our dataset .",
    "the comparisons were restricted to bright stars in uncrowded parts of m31 to suppress the influence of image quality differences between the kpno and cfht observations .",
    "one consequence of restricting the areal coverage in this way is that the majority of the stars used in the comparison have red colors , as the main body of the star - forming disk ( where bright blue stars tend to be found ) is intentionally avoided .",
    "this caveat notwithstanding , there is excellent agreement between the two sets of measurements , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , in the sense cfht  kpno",
    ". the standard deviations about the mean are @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this agreement is comparable to that found by davidge & puzia ( 2011 ) in their study of m33 .",
    "sample completeness and uncertainties in the photometry were assessed through artificial star experiments .",
    "artificial stars were assigned magnitudes and colors that hold for main sequence stars , which are the primary probes of the sfh in this paper . as with observations of real objects on the sky ,",
    "an artificial star was considered to be recovered only if ( 1 ) it was detected in two filters ( either @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) , and ( 2 ) it survived the @xmath60based culling criteria described in  3.1 .    the uncertainties and systematic effects in the photometry that arise due to crowding and/or statistical fluctuations in the noise increase substantially with magnitude when sample completeness drops below 50% .",
    "the magnitude at which 50% completeness occurs is thus one estimate of the faint limit .",
    "the artificial star experiments indicate that 50% completeness occurs near @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the outer regions of the disk , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 at intermediate radii along the major axis .",
    "these values are roughly consistent with the observed faint limits of the cmds (  4 ) .",
    "the impact of crowding on photometry can be investigated by stacking images to simulate higher stellar densities ( e.g. davidge 2001b ) .",
    "a shortcoming is that foreground stars and background galaxies , which are more - or - less uniformly distributed on the sky over angular scales of a few degrees , are over - represented in the stacked images .",
    "this can be mitigated by selecting fields for stacking that have a moderately high initial stellar density , with the aim of minimizing the number of frames that are co - added to simulate a given stellar density .",
    "four @xmath75 pixel@xmath36 areas from field 1 were selected as the building blocks for the stacking analysis .",
    "these are @xmath76 arcmin from the center of the galaxy , where the average surface brightness is @xmath77 magnitudes arcsec@xmath78 ( walterbos & kennicutt 1987 ) . the faint limit of the cmds in this part of the disk is almost the same as the outermost parts of the disk (  4 ) .",
    "two sub - fields were stacked to simulate a field with @xmath79 mag arcsec@xmath78 , while three were combined to simulate @xmath80 mag arcsec@xmath78 .",
    "all four sub - fields were combined to simulate @xmath81 mag arcsec@xmath78 .",
    "the magnitudes of stars in the stacked images were measured using the procedures discussed in  3.1 , and the resulting cmds are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the left hand column of each figure shows the cmds from the unstacked data , while the right hand column shows the cmds of the stacked images .",
    "the simulated surface brightness of each stacked field is also listed , along with the corresponding major axis radius from the walterbos & kennicutt ( 1987 ) light profile .",
    "as expected , crowding elevates the faint limit of the cmds as one moves to progressively higher surface brightnesses .",
    "an interesting practical result is that the photometry of sources with @xmath82 and @xmath83 appears not to be sensitive to surface brightness in the density regime investigated here .",
    "the brightest main sequence stars and agb stars in these data can thus be used to trace the distribution of young stars to within a few kpc of the galaxy center .",
    "we define six regions in the m31 disk to facilitate analysis and subsequent discussion .",
    "two regions are associated with the rings of uv and fir emission at r@xmath34 and 14 kpc , and these will be refered to as ring 10 and ring 14 .",
    "the inner disk is defined to be the region that is interior to ring 10 .",
    "the image stacking experiments in  3.4 indicate that crowding is an issue for all but the brightest stars with r@xmath84 kpc , and so the minimum radius for the inner disk is set at r@xmath85 kpc .",
    "the inner disk thus probes a region where the disk light dominates over that of the bulge ( e.g. figure a1 of tempel et al .",
    "the middle disk is located between ring 10 and 14 , while the outer disk is external to ring 14 .",
    "the outer disk is split into two radial intervals .",
    "this is done in part because the outer radius of the m31 disk is not clearly defined .",
    "in addition , there is evidence that the properties of star formation in low density environments may differ from those in the inner regions of disks ( bigiel et al .",
    "2010 ) , while secular processes may play a key role in defining the stellar content at large radii ( e.g. roskar et al .",
    "2008 ; sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "the outermost regions of disks may then be an environment that is distinct from the inner disk , containing population gradients with physical drivers that differ from those at smaller radii .",
    "the @xmath86 cmds of roughly 2.1 million sources in various radial intervals are shown in figure 4 .",
    "hess diagrams are shown in figure 5 to allow the relative properties of objects in the faint portions of the cmds to be examined .",
    "the radial distances listed in each panel of figures 4 and 5 are in the plane of the disk and assume 75@xmath87 inclination .",
    "this inclination produces roughly circular rings when observations of warm dust emission are de - projected to simulate the face - on appearance of m31 ( gordon et al .",
    "2006 ) . while the assumption of a single inclination is an obvious pragmatic choice ,",
    "it is a simplification given that the gas disk of m31 is warped ( e.g. corbelli et al .",
    "this warping , coupled with the orientation of m31 on the sky , frustrates efforts to extract clean radial samples that are free of annulus - to - annulus contamination .",
    "young main sequence stars form a prominent plume in the cmds , with @xmath88 at the bright end , and @xmath89 near the faint end .",
    "bright blue stars are not restricted to ring 10 and ring 14 , and are seen in all cmds with r@xmath90 kpc .",
    "recent star formation has thus not been restricted exclusively to ring 10 and ring 14 .",
    "many of the blue objects with @xmath91 ( m@xmath92 ) are bright blue supergiants ( bsgs ) , although some of these may be young compact star clusters .",
    "the diffuse sequence of objects that is displaced @xmath93 magnitude in @xmath94 redward of the main sequence , and is most pronounced in the inner disk , ring 10 , and middle disk cmds with @xmath55 between 20 and 22 , is due to helium burning stars that are at the blue extrema of their evolution .",
    "this same feature is seen in figure 2 of mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "while the primary probe of evolved stars in our data is the @xmath95 cmd (  4.2 ) , evolved red stars are also present in the @xmath86 cmds .",
    "a population of red objects with @xmath96 and @xmath97 is seen in the hess diagram of the inner disk region in figure 5 .",
    "isochrones ( see below ) indicate that evolved stars with ages of @xmath98 gyr pass through this part of the @xmath86 cmd . that these red sources occur in large numbers in the inner disk @xmath99 cmd",
    "when compared with the ring 10 and the middle disk cmds suggests that the sfr in the inner disk was elevated with respect to regions of m31 at larger radii within the past 200 myr (  6 ) .",
    "background galaxies contribute significantly to the source counts near the faint limit of these data .",
    "the majority of background objects have red colors , and populate the jumble of red sources with @xmath97 that is most obvious in the outer disk cmds .",
    "not all background objects have red colors , and davidge & puzia ( 2011 ) found that a significant fraction of the objects with blue colors at large radii in m33 are star - forming regions in moderately distant background galaxies .",
    "this being said , source counts in areas where the number of m31 disk stars is expected to be small indicate that many of the blue objects with @xmath100 in the outer disk 2 cmd are _ bona fide _ main sequence stars in m31 .",
    "m31 is viewed at intermediate galactic latitudes , and foreground stars dominate the diffuse spray of objects with @xmath101 and @xmath94 between 1 and 3 that grows more prominent towards larger r@xmath2 .",
    "the blue edge of this sequence is defined by the msto of stars in the outer disk and halo of the galaxy , while the red envelope reflects the properties of low mass main sequence stars .",
    "not all of the sources with @xmath94 between 1 and 3 are in the foreground , and bsgs with @xmath102 and @xmath101 ( i.e. to the immediate right of the m31 main sequence ) are evident in the cmds of sources with r@xmath103 kpc .",
    "the @xmath86 cmds of sources in ring 10 and ring 14 are compared with solar metallicity isochrones from girardi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in figure 6 .",
    "metallicity gradients are present in many spiral galaxies , and so a comparison with isochrones having only one metallicity may seem suspect . however , the metallicities of bsgs in m31 with r@xmath2 between 5 and 12 kpc do not vary with radius ( trundle et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting that the interstellar medium of m31 is well mixed , and that the metallicity gradient among moderately young stars is modest .",
    "therefore , with the exception of a single z = 0.004 sequence to demonstrate metallicity effects , the comparisons with isochrones are restricted to a single metallicity .",
    "the image stacking experiments discussed in  3 indicate that crowding does not affect greatly the photometric properties of objects with m@xmath104 , the majority of which are main sequence stars with ages @xmath105 myr .",
    "it is thus significant that the zero age main sequence ( zams ) defined by the isochrones falls along the blue envelope of main sequence stars , while the terminal age main sequence ( tams ) , defined by the red extent of main sequence evolution , follows the red envelope of the blue plume .",
    "that the observed blue plume is bracketed by these two evolutionary phases suggests that age is the dominant driver of main sequence width in our data , rather than photometric errors or differential reddening .",
    "ring 10 and ring 14 both contain very young stars .",
    "the brightest blue objects in ring 10 and ring 14 fall more - or - less along the 5 myr isochrone in figure 6 .",
    "this is not unexpected given that these annuli are known to contain areas of very recent star formation .",
    "it is also evident from the isochrones that the part of the cmd with m@xmath106 and @xmath107 contains evolved stars with ages @xmath108 gyr .",
    "hence , the red concentration of objects near the faint limit of the @xmath86 cmd contains intermediate age stars .",
    "the blue core helium - burning ( bheb ) sequence in m31 is not well - matched by the locus of blue loops in the z = 0.019 isochrones , in the sense that the locus of blue loops during supergiant evolution is almost 1 magnitude in @xmath94 redward of the observed sequence .",
    "mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also found differences between the observed and predicted colors of the bheb sequence in their sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "such disagreements with observations may be due to  for example  errors in the physics used to generate the models , uncertainies in circumstellar extinction , or uncertainties in the metallicities adopted for the stars .",
    "an interesting result from figure 4 of mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is that the colors predicted for bheb stars do not change greatly with metallicity when z @xmath109 .",
    "the blue loop of the z = 0.004 isochrone in figure 6 overlaps the m31 bheb sequence , and one _ possible _ explanation for the poor agreement between the observed and predicted color of the bheb sequence in figure 6 is that the stars in m31 have a metallicity that is no more than one half solar ( i.e. [ m / h ] @xmath110 ) .",
    "however , we reiterate that metallicity is just one of the factors that may affect the color predicted for the bheb sequence .",
    "the comparisons in figure 6 assume the same reddening for each star .",
    "reddening maps have been constructed for m31 using the distribution of warm and cool dust , and these could be used to estimate reddening for individual sources .",
    "however , our megacam data are not consistent with the radial extinction trends predicted from dust emission .",
    "this is demonstrated in table 2 , where the mean @xmath94 color , @xmath111 , of sources with @xmath55 between 21.75 and 22.25 is given for 5 radial intervals .",
    "an iterative @xmath112 rejection filter was applied to suppress outliers .",
    "the standard deviation about the mean , @xmath113 , is also shown , along with the mean optical depth at each r@xmath2 , @xmath114 , taken from figure 4 of tempel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "the entries in table 2 indicate that the plume containing main sequence stars and bsgs has a dispersion @xmath115 magnitudes at @xmath116 , supporting the notion that photometric errors make only a modest contribution to the width of the main sequence .",
    "the entries in table 2 further indicate that neither the mean color of the main sequence nor the dispersion about the mean changes significantly with radius between r@xmath117 kpc and 15 kpc .",
    "indeed , the mean @xmath94 color of the main sequence in this large range of r@xmath2 varies by only a few millimagnitude . to be sure",
    ", there are area - to - area variations in extinction within each annulus .",
    "however , the radial consistency of the mean @xmath94 color indicates that these variations average out to a remarkable degree when stellar measurements are combined azimuthally .",
    "the uniform color of the main sequence ridgeline in table 2 is contrary to what might be expected based on the optical depth measurements from tempel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which predict systematic radial variations in total extinction , with @xmath114 peaking in ring 10 .",
    "such an inconsistency would occur if the radial @xmath114 measurements obtained from dust emission do not apply to the majority of stars in each angular resolution element .",
    "indeed , a core assumption made by tempel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is that cool dust is uniformly distributed .",
    "there almost certainly @xmath118 a uniformly distributed cool dust component throughout the m31 disk ; however , there are also areas of cool dust emission that are concentrated on scales that are smaller than the angular resolution of the facilities that have probed fir emission , and such a component will skew @xmath119 measurements .    the tempel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) optical depth measurements are based on data from the spitzer telescope , the angular resolution of which is roughly 40 arcsec , or @xmath120 kpc in m31 , at @xmath121 m .",
    "each resolution element then has a spatial extent that is roughly one order of magnitude larger than that of a typical giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) .",
    "if a significant part of the cool dust emission within a resolution element originates from gmcs then the extinction of objects that are exterior to the gmcs , but still within the same observed angular resolution element , will be over - estimated .",
    "the stars that are obscured in gmcs by the cool dust may even be so heavily extincted that they are not detected at visible wavelengths , and if this is the case then the dust and observed stars are spatially de - coupled . in summary , if there is a cool dust component in m31 that is concentrated on gmc - like spatial scales , then the stars within at least some spitzer resolution elements will not be subject to the level of dust extinction that is predicted from dust emission .",
    "the @xmath95 cmds of roughly 3.6 million sources in the m31 disk are shown in figure 7 , while the corresponding hess diagrams are shown in figure 8 .",
    "foreground stars form a spray of objects at the bright end of the cmds in figure 7 that has a well - defined blue and red cut - off ; this sequence falls between @xmath122 and 2 , and is most obvious when @xmath123 .",
    "there is also a prominent blue plume with @xmath124 that contains main sequence stars .",
    "the blue plume is less well - defined in the @xmath95 cmds than in the @xmath86 cmds , and it is demonstrated below that this is probably a consequence of the trajectories followed by stars on this cmd as they evolve off of the zams .    a collection of objects with @xmath125 and @xmath126 between 0 and 2 forms a prominent feature in the @xmath95 cmds . at small and intermediate r@xmath2",
    "this part of the cmd is dominated by a mix of red core helium - burning ( rheb ) giants / supergiants and stars that are evolving on the agb .",
    "background galaxies make a progressively larger contribution to the faint red end of the cmds as one moves to larger r@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath95 cmds of ring 10 and ring 14 are compared with solar metallicity isochrones from girardi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in figure 9 .",
    "the isochrones follow a near - vertical trajectory on the @xmath95 cmd after leaving the zams ; this continues past the tams until the onset of red loops , smearing the main sequence in a vertical direction on the cmds , and making the blue plume in the @xmath95 cmd near @xmath124 more diffuse than in the @xmath86 cmd .",
    "it is encouraging that the blue plume in the @xmath95 cmds is bracketed by the zams and the inflexion points in the isochrones that mark the onset of red loops .",
    "the isochrones indicate that the red jumble is made up of stars in a mix of evolutionary stages , some of which are rheb and others evolving on the agb .",
    "given that the timescale for core helium burning is much longer than the timescale to evolve on the agb then stars in the former stage of evolution are the dominant population .",
    "the 160 and 240 myr isochrones pass through the main concentration of red sources that have m@xmath127 , indicating that the majority of these stars have progenitor masses @xmath128m@xmath7 .",
    "line blanketing affects the photometric properties of very red evolved stars at visible and red wavelengths , causing the most luminous portions of the agb at moderate and higher metallicities to bow over on the @xmath95 cmds ( e.g. bica et al .",
    "this is evident in figure 9 , as the 160 myr isochrone plunges to fainter m@xmath129 when @xmath130 .",
    "the most luminous portions of the agb are almost certainly missing from these cmds , and so identifying the agb - tip is problematic .",
    "the color distributions of stars can be used to investigate field - to - field variations in the recent sfh in a purely empirical manner .",
    "the @xmath126 histogram distributions of sources in three r@xmath2 intervals with m@xmath129 between 4 and 3 , which corresponds to @xmath54 between 20.9 and 21.9 based on the apparent @xmath54 distance modulus , are compared in figure 10 .",
    "comparisons with isochrones in figure 9 indicate that the blue peak is populated by stars with ages @xmath105 myr , while the red peak contains stars with ages between 60 and 200 myr .",
    "the number counts in each radial interval have been corrected statistically for foreground and background contamination using source counts in areas that are external to outer disk 2 .",
    "these control fields , the location of which are indicated in figure 1 , were examined by eye to ensure that they do not contain obvious concentrations of young stars .",
    "the control fields almost certainly contain some intermediate age stars that belong to m31 , and so the number counts in these areas may ( slightly ) overestimate the level of foreground and background contamination at the faint end .",
    "that ring 10 has been an area of star - forming activity during the past 100 myr is clearly evident from the number of blue stars in the top panel of figure 10 .",
    "the mix of young stars ( i.e. those in the blue color peak ) to intermediate age stars ( i.e. those in the red color peak ) changes with radius , and these variations are explored in the lower panel of figure 10 , where the color distributions have been normalized according to the number of objects with @xmath126 between 0.25 and 0.25 .",
    "there is a wide dispersion in the relative amplitudes of the blue and red peaks .",
    "the ratio of red to blue objects in the inner disk is substantially larger than in either ring 10 or the middle disk , indicating that the sfh in this part of m31 was skewed to higher levels of activity 60  200 myr in the past .",
    "this is another manifestation of the pronounced red stellar concentrations that are seen in the hess diagrams of the inner disk in figures 5 and 8 .",
    "the sfh of the inner disk during intermediate epochs is re - visited in  6 .    the blue sequence in the middle disk peaks at a bluer @xmath126 color than at smaller radii .",
    "a comparatively low reddening for the middle disk is probably not driving the peak color of blue stars , as there is not a corresponding shift in the color of the main sequence on the @xmath86 cmd (  4.1 ) .",
    "rather , the trajectory of the isochrones on the @xmath95 plane makes the @xmath126 color distribution of blue stars more susceptible to variations in the recent sfh . the blue sequence will narrow as stars at the older end of the @xmath131 myr age range are removed , as these stars have redder colors than younger stars in a given magnitude interval",
    "this may not be accompanied by a skewing of the color distribution of red stars , as these objects span a much larger range of ages than main sequence stars with the same m@xmath129 , and so their mean colors are less susceptible to variations in the sfh .",
    "as in our study of m33 ( davidge & puzia 2011 ) , we use the @xmath63 lf of blue stars to probe the sfh of the m31 disk .",
    "our @xmath63 photometry includes main sequence stars throughout much of the m31 disk with ages @xmath132 myr , allowing the sfh in this timeframe to be directly probed .",
    "the damping time for large scale star - forming activity in disks is @xmath133 years ( e.g. leitherer 2001 ) , and so elevated sfrs may linger for this time after they are initiated .",
    "therefore , inferences can be made into the more distant past than would otherwise be permitted from resolved stars .",
    "following davidge & puzia ( 2011 ) , lfs were constructed of sources with @xmath134 between 0.5 and 0.5 .",
    "the majority of objects in this color range are main sequence stars .",
    "while most foreground and background objects in the cmds have red colors , there are modest numbers of contaminants that fall within the color interval considered here .",
    "these include blue horizontal branch stars in the galactic halo , and star - forming regions in moderately distant spiral galaxies .",
    "we account for these statistically using number counts in portions of our megacam fields that are offset from the disk of m31 (  4.3 ) .",
    "the mean lf in these control regions follows a power - law , and a characteristic exponent and zeropoint were determined by using the method of least squares to fit a power - law to this lf .",
    "this fitted relation was then subtracted from each of the observed lfs , after scaling to account for differences in angular coverage .",
    "the lfs of various radial intervals are compared in figure 11 .",
    "the number counts in the top panel are as observed on the sky , and these are given in units of counts arcmin@xmath78 per 0.5 magnitude interval in m@xmath135 .",
    "the @xmath8 dex offset between the middle and outer disk lfs is consistent with the walterbos & kennicutt ( 1987 ) surface brightness profile , as is the 0.5 dex ( i.e. 1.25 magnitude arcsec@xmath78 ) dispersion between the lfs with r@xmath2 in the range 5 - 15 kpc .",
    "this broad consistency between star counts and surface photometry is encouraging , and suggests that the bright blue stars detected in the megacam data are not affected by crowding .",
    "the lfs in the bottom panel of figure 11 have been normalized to match the ring 10 lf between m@xmath136 and 5.25 , thereby allowing the shapes of the lfs to be compared .",
    "the lfs follow power - laws , and the outer disk 2 lf is steeper than the rest .",
    "the mix of massive and intermediate mass stars in the outer disk thus differs from that in the inner disk .",
    "the lfs of the inner disk , ring 10 , and the middle disk in the lower panel of figure 11 are similar .",
    "this is perhaps surprising given the concentration of star - forming pockets in ring 10 (  6 ) .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the lfs are azimuthal averages , and isolated star - forming pockets will only influence the mean lf if they occur in large numbers .",
    "in fact , while ring 10 and ring 14 contain areas of intense recent star formation , they do not stand out in the uv color profile measured by thilker et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; rather , the uv color stays roughly constant between 10 and 15 kpc .",
    "the comparisons in figure 11 indicate that the mix of young to intermediate age stars in ring 10 is not different from that in the inner or middle disks  when averaged over large areas , the sfhs of these regions have been broadly similar during the past 100  200 myr .",
    "a comparison of the properties of bright main sequence stars in m31 and m33 provides a purely empirical means of assessing the relative star - forming activities of these galaxies during recent epochs . to be sure ,",
    "star - forming activity in disk galaxies depends on a number of factors , such as environment and mass , and it would be of interest to compare the stellar content of m31 with that of other large galaxies of similar morphological type ; however , such datasets do not yet exist .",
    "differences in size and morphological type aside , m33 is an important comparison object as it is at roughly the same distance of m31 , and has been the subject of a number of investigations .",
    "the sfhs of m31 and m33 have probably also been coupled at some point in the past (  1.3 ) . finally , the specific sfr ( ssfr ) of m33 is near the mid - point of spiral galaxies in general ( munoz - mateos et al .",
    "2007 ) , making it a benchmark for activity in a ` typical ' star - forming galaxy .",
    "the m33 megacam dataset examined by davidge & puzia ( 2011 ) was recorded during observing conditions that were similar to those of the present m31 observations , and are adopted here for comparisons with m31 .",
    "main sequence stars with ages @xmath137 myr are traced throughout much of m33 ( davidge & puzia 2011 ) and m31 (  3 ) , and these stars provide a direct means of comparing the sfrs of these galaxies .",
    "davidge & puzia ( 2011 ) found 3000 massive main sequence stars and bsgs in m33 with ages @xmath138 myr . applying the m33 selection criteria of m@xmath139 to the current data",
    ", we find that there are @xmath140 similar objects in m31 .",
    "the sfr in m31 during the past 10 myr has thus been one third that of m33 . for comparison ,",
    "the integrated h@xmath35 luminosities of m31 and m33 are comparable ( e.g. kennicutt et al . 2008 ) , while m31 has a slightly higher fir flux than m33 ( rice et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "the ssfr is a measure of the rate at which stellar mass grows due to star formation .",
    "the bulk of the @xmath141band light from most galaxies has its origins in old and intermediate age stars , and so integrated @xmath141band brightness serves as a crude proxy for total stellar mass . adopting the apparent @xmath142 magnitudes of m31 and m33 from jarrett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and a distance modulus of 24.92 for m33 ( bonanos et al .",
    "2006 ) , then the integrated total brightnesses of these galaxies are m@xmath143 ( m31 ) and m@xmath144 ( m33 ) .",
    "based on the numbers of blue stars with ages @xmath138 myr ( see above ) and their integrated @xmath141band brightnesses , then the ssfr of m31 is only @xmath145 that of m33 .",
    "the difference between the ssfrs of m31 and m33 is almost certainly greater than this , as it has been assumed that m31 and m33 have identical @xmath141band mass - to - light ratios ( m / l@xmath146 ) .",
    "in actual fact , given the higher relative fraction of young stars in m33 , then the m / l@xmath146 of m33 is probably lower than that of m31 .",
    "m / l ratios at a given age depend on metallicity , although for effective ages @xmath147 years the differences between the m / l ratios predicted by z = 0.02 and z = 0.008 models are miniscule ( e.g. figure 4 of mouhcine & lancon 2003 ) .",
    "minor differences in the relative m / l ratios of these galaxies notwithstanding , it is clear that m31 is practically dead in terms of recent star - forming activity when compared with m33 .    the m31 and m33 lfs , normalized in the interval m@xmath148 4 to 5 , are compared in figure 12 .",
    "the m33 lf is that of objects with r@xmath2 between 6 and 8 kpc from davidge & puzia ( 2011 ) .",
    "the lf of sources in this part of the galaxy is representative of the main body of the m33 disk .",
    "there are conspicuous differences between the m31 and m33 lfs in figure 12 .",
    "these differences are likely not a result of differences in metallicity between stars in the disks of m31 and m33 .",
    "while model lfs of blue sources with z = 0.019 and z = 0.008 do differ , the differences are largely restricted to m@xmath149 .",
    "this magnitude regime is dominated by bsgs , the properties of which are affected by metallicity - dependent mass loss rates . when m@xmath150 main sequence stars dominate , and the model lfs of blue sources show only slight differences .    when compared with the m33 disk ,",
    "outer disk 1 has a lower number of stars with ages of a few tens of myr with respect to stars that formed a few hundred myr in the past .",
    "when compared with the m31 lfs , the m33 lf is also deficient in stars with m@xmath135 between 2 and 4 , which is a m@xmath135 range that corresponds to msto ages of 40  100 myr .",
    "davidge & puzia ( 2011 ) found that the lf of bright main sequence stars that formed during the past few hundred myr in m33 is well matched by a constant sfr ( csfr ) model , and the comparisons in figure 12 indicate that such a sfh does not hold for m31 .",
    "the sfh of the m31 disk is examined in more detail in the next section .",
    "we use a forward modelling approach , in which model lfs are constructed for pre - defined sfhs and are then compared with the observations",
    ". models were generated from the z = 0.019 girardi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) isochrones using routines in the starfish package ( harris & zaritsky 2001 ) .",
    "the models assume an imf power - law index @xmath151 , which kroupa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find holds for massive stars .",
    "models with a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf differ only slightly from those used here ( e.g. figure 11 of davidge & puzia 2011 ) .",
    "the @xmath63 lf of main sequence stars provides a relatively robust means of investigating sfhs , as the main sequence is probably the best understood phase of stellar evolution .",
    "still , there is an incomplete understanding of the physical processes that affect the structure and evolution of massive main sequence stars .",
    "these include uncertainties in convection , which is the dominant mode of energy transport in the central regions of massive stars , mass loss , and rotation .",
    "while these uncertainties affect the post - zams models of massive stars , it is encouraging that the zams and tams loci predicted by the isochrones match the blue and red envelopes of the main sequence on the cmds (  4 ) .",
    "statistical studies of main sequence stars are susceptible to uncertainties in the properties of close companions , which are not resolved at the distance of m31",
    ". these uncertainties are not an issue for statistical studies of evolved stars , as the light from the most evolved star in a close stellar system swamps that from less evolved companions at visible wavelengths . however , if all the stars in a close system are on the main sequence then  depending on the mass ratio ",
    "companions may contribute a significant fraction of the total system light . while many of the sources in our data are unresolved systems , if the statistical properties of these systems ( e.g. the frequency of binary or higher - order systems , the mass ratio of components , etc ) do not change with the mass of the primary then the main sequence lf will still yield useful information for a differential examination of the sfh .    the megacam data sample stars in a wide range of evolutionary states , all of which provide information about the sfh of m31 .",
    "however , combining information from different evolutionary states to investigate the sfh may lead to complications when interpreting the results , as the dominant sources of uncertainties in the input model physics vary with evolutionary phase .",
    "comparisons of the sfhs of galaxies at different distances may be most prone to uncertainties related to evolutionary state , as the sfhs may be based on objects in very different stages of evolution .",
    "gogarten et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggest that this may be a factor when comparing the sfhs of m33 and ngc 300",
    ". the impact of uncertainties in models of the most advanced stages of stellar evolution on sfhs has been investigated by melbourne et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who compute separate sfhs for a dwarf galaxy using main sequence stars and agb stars .",
    "the two sfhs differ substantially , and melbourne et al .",
    "( 2010 ) attribute this difference to an incomplete empirical calibration of the agb models , which rely heavily on the lmc and smc as benchmarks .",
    "the models used here assume a fixed metallicity , and so do not account for metallicity evolution . while the mean metallicity of a disk grows with time as material that is processed in stars",
    "is recycled into the ism , a fixed metallicity is appropriate given that our models cover a time span that is short when compared with the enrichment timescale of a disk .",
    "indeed , the age - metallicity relation of the solar neighborhood during recent epochs has a shallow slope ( e.g. edvardsson et al . 1993 ) , and the rate of metallicity evolution in m31 will be even more subdued than this given the lower sfr .",
    "the most basic sfh model is that of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) , in which all stars have the same age and metallicity ; ssp lfs are also the building blocks from which lfs that track more elaborate sfhs are constructed . because galaxies are composite stellar systems , it is unlikely that their lfs will be well matched by ssp models . still , if a galaxy experiences a single large episode of star formation that is caught early in its evolution then the lf of the brightest stars may follow that of an ssp .",
    "the @xmath63 lfs of main sequence stars in three radial intervals are compared with a log(t@xmath152 ssp model lf in figure 13 .",
    "the ring 10 lf is similar to that of the inner and middle disk regions ( figure 11 ) , and so comparisons with models are restricted to the four intervals shown in figure 13 .",
    "m31 is a composite stellar system , and so it is not surprising that there is poor agreement between the model ssp lf and the observations .",
    "still , the ring 10 lf , which samples a region with a high concentration of recent star formation , has an exponent that comes closest to matching that of the ssp model .",
    "the sfhs of isolated , passively evolving disks may be affected by stochastic effects , with spikes in star - forming activity due to events such as the passage of spiral arms and the propagation of density waves from sne in young clusters and associations .",
    "evidence for variations in the sfh of the solar neighborhood due to the passage of spiral arms has been found by hernandez et al .",
    "nevertheless , the impact of stochastic events will average out when considered over long timespans and large areas , and the sfhs of passively evolving disks might be expected to come close to that of a csfr .",
    "the @xmath63 lfs are compared with csfr models in figure 14 , and there is much better agreement with the observations than in figure 13 .",
    "in fact , the csfr model provides a reasonable match to the outer disk 2 lf , and is a fair representation of the outer disk 1 lf .",
    "still , with the exception of the outer disk 2 lf , the csfr model lfs in figure 14 tend to be steeper than the observed lfs .",
    "indeed , while the csfr model is a reasonable match to the outer disk 1 observations with m@xmath153 , which corresponds to msto ages @xmath154 myr , it underestimates the number of stars at the bright end .",
    "these differences are even more evident when the ring 10 and ring 14 lfs are compared with the csfr model",
    ".    given the differences between the observations and models in figure 14 , we investigated sfhs in which the sfr during the past 10 myr has increased with respect to that expected for a csfr at earlier epochs .",
    "models were generated in which the recent sfr was increased by various amounts , and the results were compared with the observed lfs ; the best matches , selected by eye , are shown in figure 15 . also shown in each panel",
    "is b@xmath155 , which is the ratio of the number of stars that formed within the past 10 myr to the number that formed in the interval 10  100 myr .",
    "the outer disk 2 lf is not shown in figure 15 , as it is represented adequately by the csfr model .",
    "models with elevated recent star - forming activity better match the lfs of the three regions shown in figure 15 than the csfr models .",
    "higher recent sfrs are required to match the ring 10 and ring 14 lfs than is required to match the outer disk 1 lf .",
    "while this is consistent with ring 10 and 14 being areas of comparatively intense recent star - forming activity , if elevated levels of recent star formation occur in only part of outer disk 1 ( i.e. at the smallest r@xmath2 in this region ) then the effect of any recent increase in the sfr will be diluted .",
    "the differences in the amplitude of recent star - forming activity aside , it is clear that the recent upswing in star - forming activity has not been restricted to ring 10 and 14 , but occured over a large fraction of the disk  the change in the recent sfr is not a localized phenomenon that is restricted to only a small part of the m31 disk , but is more global in nature .",
    "the spatial distribution of stars in a known age range is an important probe of galaxy evolution .",
    "samples of young main sequence stars ( yms ; ages @xmath137 myr ) and intermediate - age main sequence stars ( ims ; ages @xmath5 myr ) were selected from the megacam data based on their location in the @xmath86 cmd .",
    "the boundaries of the yms and ims regions in figure 16 were defined using isochrones as guides , while also keeping in mind the results of the artificial star and stacking experiments discussed in  3 .",
    "the distributions of objects in the yms and ims samples are shown in figures 17 ( as observed on - sky ) and 18 ( as would be observed face - on ) .",
    "the face - on distributions assume that the stars are in an infinitely thin , unwarped disk , and departures from these assumptions will cause blurring of structures in the de - projected distributions .",
    "some blurring is expected , as the gas disk of m31 is warped ( corbelli et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "it is evident from figures 17 and 18 that ( 1 ) recent star - forming activity in m31 has not been uniformly distributed with azimuthal angle , and ( 2 ) knots of stars in both samples are seen throughout the disk .",
    "the stars in the yms sample tend to be tightly clustered and define partial arcs .",
    "the distribution of yms stars indicates that the most intense area of recent star formation was in the north east quadrant of the disk .",
    "there is broad agreement between the yms distribution and images of uv ( figure 1 of thilker et al .",
    "2005 ) and mir ( figure 1 of gordon et al .",
    "2006 ) emission .",
    "while peaks in hi emission shown in figure 1 of unwin ( 1983 ) coincide with areas of high yms density in ring 10 , at radii @xmath156 arcmin ( r@xmath157 kpc ) there are collections of yms stars with no corresponding hi feature .",
    "in contrast , there is much better agreement between the location of yms concentrations and the peaks in co ( 10 ) emission mapped by nieten et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "stars in the yms sample are seen at moderately small r@xmath2 .",
    "large - scale , well - defined structures that contain bright blue stars are seen near 20 arcmin ( i.e. r@xmath158 kpc ) , while individual objects in the yms sample are detected to within 10 arcmin ( r@xmath84 kpc ) of the nucleus . this r@xmath2 is where the bulge and disk contribute comparable amounts of light at visible wavelengths ( e.g. tempel et al .",
    "2011 ) , and is where the fuv ",
    "nuv color in the main body of the galaxy is reddest ( thilker et al . 2005 ) .",
    "ring structures are much more pronounced in the ims distribution than in the yms distribution .",
    "the ims sample contains stars that formed over a wider range of ages than the yms stars , and so the effects of spatial fluctuations in star - forming activity are expected to average out .",
    "the more - or - less uniform azimuthal distribution of ims objects in the rings suggests that the location of star formation in the immediate past differed from the present day , and that areas of active star formation in the rings have moved through a wide range of position angles within m31 .",
    "that ring 10 is seen in samples of objects that are as old as 100 myr indicates that the event that spurred its formation must have occured at least 100 myr ago .",
    "in fact , it is somewhat surprising that rings and arcs are present at all in the ims sample , given the rate at which stars in the disks of nearby star - forming galaxies acquire random velocities with time as they interact with giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "the velocities acquired in this manner can cause disk stars to move substantial distances over timespans of 100 myr .",
    "for example , spiral structure in m33 is well - defined by stars with ages @xmath138 myr , but is not apparent in the distribution of stars with ages of 100 myr ( davidge & puzia 2011 ) .",
    "the presence of organized structures in the disk of m31 that are defined by objects in the ims sample suggests that stars in these parts of m31 do not attain the same random motions as their counterparts in m33 .",
    "the narrow distribution of orbital angular momentum that is expected for star - forming material in rings undoubtedly contributes to restricting the time evolution of random velocities among stars in these structures .",
    "a sample of rheb@xmath159agb stars has been selected using the boundaries indicated on the @xmath95 cmd in figure 16 .",
    "the objects in this part of the cmd formed 60  200 myr in the past , and so probe earlier epochs than the ims sample . the faint limit of the extraction region in figure 16 reflects the results of the data characterization experiments discussed in  3 .",
    "the face - on distribution of objects in the rheb@xmath159agb sample is shown in figure 19 .",
    "the distribution observed on the sky is not shown , as the density of red sources makes it difficult to detect structure because of the orientation of m31 on the sky .",
    "as in figure 18 , the major axis of m31 points upwards .",
    "the concentration near ( dx , dy ) = ( 60,20 ) is centered on m32 ; the dense central regions of m32  where stars are not resolved  appears as a hole in the rheb@xmath159agb distribution .",
    "the concentration near ( dx , dy ) = ( 100 , 0 ) is probably associated with ngc 205 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the distribution of rheb@xmath159agb stars in figure 19 is asymmetric about the horizontal axis , in the sense that the stellar density above and to the left of the galaxy center ( i.e. along the north east arm of the semi - major axis ) is higher than that below the galaxy center .",
    "there are also asymmetries to the left and right of the galaxy center , which fall along the minor axis .",
    "however , the orientation of m31 on the sky is such that the distribution of objects along the minor axis is more prone to uncertainties arising from  for example  the inherent thickness of the disk and the presence of stars in the bulge of m31 , both of which may affect the de - projected stellar distribution .",
    "we thus focus on the asymmetry along the major axis , where the de - projected distribution is most secure .",

    "the density of rheb@xmath159agb stars along the ne axis within 50 arcmin ( @xmath3 kpc ) of the galaxy center is higher than along the sw axis . at @xmath160 arcmin",
    "these stars have a density that is 0.4 dex higher on the ne axis than at the same point on the sw axis .",

    "persistent large scale concentrations of elevated star - forming activity are seen in other nearby disk galaxies , such as ngc 253 ( davidge 2010 ) .",
    "the number counts of objects in the ims sample are also shown in figure 20 , and it is evident that the ims and rheb@xmath159agb samples have very different radial distributions .",
    "star - forming rings form a 5 kpc periodicity in the distribution of ims stars , and these structures are most pronounced along the ne axis .",
    "the rings have an amplitude of @xmath8 dex in the ims counts .",
    "the red stars show more gradual variations with radius , and there is little or no correlation with features in the ims distribution .",
    "departures from large scale trends in the rheb@xmath159agb distribution are substantially smaller than those in the ims distribution , amounting to @xmath98 dex .",
    "in addition to the periodic nature of structure in the radial distribution of ims stars , there is also a systematic gradient in the relative numbers of rheb@xmath159agb and ims stars .",
    "this is investigated in the lower panel of figure 20 , where the ratio of objects in the two samples is shown .",
    "there is a tendency for the numbers of rheb@xmath159agb and ims sources to become more equal towards larger r@xmath2 , indicating that star formation was more centrally concentrated in m31 during intermediate epochs than at present .",
    "this trend is most noticeable when considering sources along the ne axis ; while a gradient is seen out to r@xmath162 kpc along the sw axis , it may reverse at larger radii .",
    "we note that the fuv ",
    "nuv color in m31 decreases ( i.e. becomes bluer ) towards larger radii in the inner disk when r@xmath163 kpc ( thilker et al . 2005 ) , and this is broadly consistent with the relative radial distributions of the rheb@xmath159agb and ims objects in our data .",
    "the change in uv color in the interval r@xmath164 kpc corresponds to a change in luminosity - weighted ssp age from @xmath165 myr to 290 myr ( thilker et al . 2005 ) .",

    "the primary goals of our study are ( 1 ) to probe the sfh of m31 during the past few hundred myr , and ( 2 ) to search for evidence of recent interactions .    when considered alongside studies of the outer regions and bulge of m31 , which have yielded insights into the evolution of the galaxy during early and intermediate epochs , the results of the current work help to develop an understanding of the evolution of m31 in the context of other nearby galaxies .",
    "m31 has been subjected to interactions with companions ( e.g.  1 ) , and this activity has continued to cosmologically recent epochs .",
    "these interactions have influenced the large scale re - distribution of stars and gas , and have had a major influence on the sfh of the galaxy . in the remainder of this section",

    "stellar density changes with location in m31 , and this affects the spatial coverage of the stellar samples used here to probe the sfh . because they are among the brightest stars in the galaxy , and have relatively blue colors when compared with the underlying disk , main sequence stars with ages @xmath3 myr are detected over a large fraction of the m31 disk . while resolving fainter stars",
    "is more challenging , main sequence stars with ages @xmath5 myr are still detected at r@xmath168 a few kpc in our data .",
    "the recent ( i.e. within a hundred myr ) sfh can thus be investigated over much of the m31 disk .",
    "the @xmath63 lf of main sequence stars are indicative of a constant sfr during the past 10  100 myr , and so suggest that any major disturbance to the disk of m31 during intermediate epochs probably occured more than @xmath169 myr in the past .",
    "however , the number counts of the brightest main sequence stars indicate that the sfr has increased by a factor of @xmath170 during the past @xmath3 myr . that this upturn in the sfr was not restricted to ring 10 and ring 14 , which are the areas of m31 that contain a large fraction of its young stars and star - forming material , indicates that the trigger was an event that spurred activity throughout the disk , and is probably not stochastic in nature .",
    "a rise in star - forming activity during the past 10 myr is not seen at r@xmath0 kpc , and this provides clues into the nature of any event that may have triggered the change in the sfr . if the sfr was elevated by an interaction with a companion , then the point of closest encounter between m31 and this companion would have been r@xmath90 kpc ( e.g. hopkins et al . 2009 ) .",

    "large scale spiral structure is often associated with recent interactions . if m32 ( or another companion ) passed through the disk of m31 in the recent past then why is there no large scale spiral structure ?",
    "the amplitude of any spiral pattern depends on the mass of the perturber and the cold gas content of the larger galaxy .",

    "the sfh measured from the megacam images is broadly consistent with that presented by williams ( 2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "williams ( 2002 ) examined a suite of hst / wfpc2 images to investigate the sfhs of the m31 disk and its environs .",
    "given the widely distributed locations of these fields , coupled with hst / wfpc2 s modest science field , it is perhaps not surprising that there is a substantial field - to - field dispersion in the sfhs found from these data .",
    "still , the sfhs for the majority of his fields are consistent with a csfr during the past few hundred myr , in agreement with the sfh deduced from the megacam @xmath63 lfs of main sequence stars during the time interval 10  100 myr .",
    "not all of the hst / wfpc2 fields show evidence of an upturn in the sfr within the past 10  20 myr .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as the distribution of young stars , uv light , mir emission , and molecular material all indicate that the recent rise in star - forming activity occured in isolated areas that are distributed throughout the disk .",
    "the sfhs deduced from the megacam data are based on stellar content that covers substantial swaths of the m31 disk",
    ". the sampling of small star - forming areas by the substantially smaller hst / wfpc2 field will be less complete .",
    "williams ( 2003 ) used wide - field ground - based images that cover a total area of 1.4 degrees@xmath36 to probe the recent sfh of the m31 disk .",
    "the level of star - forming activity was found to decline by 50% from @xmath171 myr to @xmath172 myr in the past , although the sfr during the past 64 myr is steady to within @xmath173 m@xmath7 year@xmath20 , thereby approximating a csfr to within @xmath174 .",
    "the sfr was also found to increase during the past 25 myr , in broad agreement with the results found here .",
    "the qualitative agreement with the williams ( 2003 ) results are significant , as williams examined a much smaller portion of the disk , and used a cmd - fitting technique that relies on stars spanning a range of evolutionary states , in contrast to our study which is based on main sequence stars .",
