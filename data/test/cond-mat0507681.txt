    "ultracold mixtures of alkali atoms have attracted great interest among atomic physicists .",
    "the ability to simultaneously cool and trap multiple species offers the possibility to study a large variety of physical phenomena not previously accessible with a single species such as novel degenerate quantum systems made of fermi - bose mixtures @xcite .",
    "thermalization plays a crucial role in the cooling of a sample by evaporation , and/or in the implementation of sympathetic cooling .",
    "the detailed knowledge of the underlying physics is all the more important for experiments where the time available to perform evaporation is limited @xcite , or for the optimization of the evaporation ramp in the multi - partial - wave regime @xcite .",
    "in addition the return to equilibrium of a gas initially prepared in an out - of - equilibrium state is a widely used way to infer the value of the scattering length @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework to describe the thermalization between two cold gases confined in a box or a harmonic trap .",
    "in contrast to previous theoretical studies on this subject @xcite , we explicitly take into account all partial waves involved in the collision process , and we work out the role played by the confinement in all collisional regimes . since the basic mechanism described by the boltzmann equation is binary collisions , two - component systems exhibit all the complexities of @xmath0-component systems .",
    "the generalization of the results we obtain to systems containing more than two species is therefore straightforward .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the expression for the collision terms can be easily extended to include the effects of both bose and fermi statistics leading to the boltzmann - nordheim equation @xcite .",
    "in fact , most of the results discussed in this paper also hold in the presence of quantum degeneracy , provided the system is not bose - einstein condensed .",
    "the quantitative estimates of collision effects presented in this work are , however , based on classical statistics . as shown in refs @xcite for bosons and @xcite for fermions , our approach , based on the result of the classical physics , is valid as soon as the temperature of the sample is larger than twice the temperature for degeneracy , i.e. the critical temperature for bosons and the fermi temperature for fermions .",
    "the collision problem is simplified by an appropriate change of variables .",
    "we introduce the center of mass velocity @xmath19 , the total mass @xmath20 , the relative velocity @xmath21 , and the reduced mass @xmath22 .",
    "the relative velocity changes from the value @xmath23 before the collision to the value @xmath24 after the collision , keeping the same value for the modulus @xmath25 because of energy conservation .",
    "the collision process is described by specifying the scattering direction with the polar angle @xmath26 and the azimuthal angle @xmath27 of the final relative velocity @xmath24 with respect to the initial relative velocity @xmath23 before the collision .",
    "the corresponding solid angle @xmath28 enters the expression for the integrand of the collision integrals .",
