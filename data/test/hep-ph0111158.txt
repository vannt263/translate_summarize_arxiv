    "the answer has importance for chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules are integral expressions that relate the hadronic and partonic regimes , _",
    "i.e. _ the low energy world of resonances with the high energy world of ( tractable ) qcd . since their conception over twenty years ago  @xcite , qcd sum rules have become an established technique both for calculating hadronic properties in channels , where the qcd expressions are under control , and , conversely , estimating qcd parameters ( such as the masses of the quarks ) in channels where there is good experimental information .",
    "using qcd sum rules in the scalar channel is not a new idea .",
    "they were first applied to the scalar mesons in  @xcite where laplace sum rules were used ( for a recent review of laplace sum rules see  @xcite ) . here the phenomenological side was represented using the , now standard , resonance + continuum ansatz , with resonances being represented as @xmath13-functions and the continuum being calculated entirely within perturbative qcd . as only the operator product expansion ( ope ) terms , discussed in sect .",

    "the @xmath14 state was predicted to have a mass of around 1.35  gev .",
    "these findings were supported by bramon and narison  @xcite , who used qcd sum rules to calculate the couplings of the @xmath4 and @xmath15 to two photons . again modelling the resonances with @xmath13-functions",
    "the authors concluded that a @xmath11 interpretation of these two mesons could not be ruled out with the data then available .",
    "the effects of going beyond the ope were studied in  @xcite , where instantons ( see sect .  [ sec : instantons ] ) were included on the theoretical side , but not in the qcd continuum on the phenomenological side .",

    "it was concluded that the lightest @xmath11 state in this channel had a mass @xmath16  1  gev .    for the light scalar mesons",
    "the zero - width approximation is not a good one and the first attempt to go beyond it in a sum rule investigation was by elias _",

    "here resonances were represented by breit - wigner formulae , which , whilst better than a @xmath13-function , still do not adequately describe the complex structure in the scalar sector .",

    "laplace sum rules were used , but in an integral form which requires the calculation of perturbative expressions at rather low energy scales .",
    "again instantons were included , but not in the continuum . in the isovector channel , the @xmath15",
    "was found to decouple from the sum rule and the mass of the lightest quarkonium isovector was consistent with the @xmath17 . in the isoscalar channel",
    "the conclusions were not so clear cut , it was predicted that the lightest quarkonium here should have a width less than half of its mass , and although the @xmath4 could not be ruled out as the main contributor a lighter state was preferred .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in  @xcite .",
    "this study used both laplace and finite energy sum rules , again requiring perturbative expressions to be evaluated at low energies .",
    "the authors noted , that for a consistent treatment of the borel sum rules , the instanton effects should also be included in the qcd continuum contribution .",
    "the sum rules were dominated by an isoscalar with mass around 1  gev and an isovector with mass around 1.5  gev , thus suggesting the @xmath4 and @xmath17 as the lightest @xmath11 states in their respective channels . however , in the same work , a comparison to a more realistic resonance shape predicted resonance parameters for the lightest quarkonium of @xmath18  mev and @xmath19  mev .",
    "these parameters are not consistent with the @xmath4 , but could describe a breit - wigner fit to the @xmath3 .    in  @xcite , maltman used pinched weight finite energy sum rules to calculate the decay constants of the @xmath15 and @xmath17 , which were then compared with the decay constant of the , presumably @xmath11 , @xmath20 .",
    "instantons were included and all qcd integrals were carried out in the complex plane , which improves the convergence of perturbative expressions .",
    "the isovector decay constants were found to be of comparable size , suggesting a similar structure for both .",
    "the author concluded that this favoured a unitarised quark model  @xcite scenario , where two physical hadrons can arise from one ` seed ' state .    in the work that follows",

    "the largest source of uncertainty in our calculation is the value of the phenomenological constant of proportionality , @xmath102 , defined in eqs .",
    "( 27,28 ) .",
    "this could only be determined to an accuracy of 20% , and so gives the dominant uncertainty in the final result of 0.5  mev .",
    "our final estimate is then @xmath130 . in table",
    "[ tab : masses ] we list some other recent determinations of this quantity . we see that our estimate is consistent , though lower , than earlier sum rule determinations . though not agreeing with the results of quenched lattice qcd ,",
    "our value is reassuringly consistent with the early results of unquenched lattice calculations which are just beginning to appear in the literature .",
    "the application of qcd sum rules to the isoscalar - scalar current requires a realistic representation of the contributing resonances .",
    "none in this channel remotely approximates a @xmath131function , fig .  2 .",
    "indeed , states like the @xmath132 ( or @xmath3 ) are far too broad to be sensibly described by simple breit - wigner forms",
    ". moreover they overlap with other resonances like the @xmath4 and strongly coupled thresholds , like @xmath133 .",
    "it is quite natural that the @xmath134 correlator is expressly related to the @xmath135 scattering amplitude and so the vacuum polarization can be described directly in terms of experimental information without the need for further ( breit - wigner - like ) approximations .",
    "we have shown that such coupling schemes , defined in sect .",
    "[ subsec : ansatz ] , are perfectly capable of saturating qcd finite energy sum rules . in @xmath21 scattering",
    "the @xmath4 appears as a sharp dip .",
    "consequently , in our coupling schemes this state makes relatively little contribution to the correlator , in total contrast to the conclusions of shakin and wang  @xcite .",
    "that good saturation is possible strongly suggests then that the @xmath4 does indeed make only a small contribution to the scalar - isoscalar sum rules , which in turn implies that it does not contain a large @xmath136 component in its wave function .",
    "this result is also at odds with the conclusion reached in  @xcite .",
    "however , as explained above , when the same authors  @xcite considered a more realistic approximation for the resonance shape , the parameters found were more consistent with the @xmath3 than the @xmath4 . from the present analysis , beyond saying that it is not strongly @xmath136",
    ", we can make no comment on the structure of the @xmath4 .",
    "the saturation curves we obtain are remarkably flat and close to one from low values of @xmath34 , see figs .",
    "as the exponential in the weight function tends to suppress the integrand in the region @xmath33 , saturation at these values of @xmath34 means it is the lower energy portion of the experimental data that is most important in saturating the sum rules .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath113 ( with mass @xmath137 and width @xmath138 ) will not contribute until . that the sum rules are fulfilled from @xmath139",
    "implies it is the @xmath3 that plays the most important role in saturating the @xmath136 scalar - isoscalar sum rules .    our results again",
    "show that the operator product expansion is not enough to describe the physics of the scalar mesons completely .",
    "we find saturation only when instantons are included .",
    "one potentially worrying point of this analysis is the need to tune the average instanton size away from its accepted value of . to or 0.40  0.42  fm , which is about 25% larger .",
    "the validity of the instanton liquid model relies on the mean separation of instantons being significantly larger than their average size .",
    "if this is not true then neighbouring instantons will overlap significantly and it becomes meaningless to talk about individual instantons .",
    "the assumed average instanton separation of 1  fm is only about 2.5 times the value of @xmath77 required by our sum rule , and so we are probably approaching this limit . reassuringly",
    "though , lattice simulations of the topological features of the qcd vacuum seem to find average instanton sizes similar to the one we are forced to use ( for a summary of lattice determinations of instanton parameters see  @xcite ) .",
    "the above results follow from ratios of the finite energy sum rules defined in eq .",
    "( 33 ) and displayed in figs .  4 - 8 .",
    "moreover , the absolute value of each is determined by the quark mass curves of sect .",
    "[ subsec : mass ] .",
    "these are also found to be flat and this constancy sets in already below @xmath140 , fig .",
    "this is again evidence that our coupling schemes are capable of satisfying the sum rules and that the state most important for this is the @xmath3 .",
    "the value we find for the average @xmath141 and @xmath142 quark mass is @xmath143 the most conservative way to interpret this result is merely as a consistency check .",
    "a number of assumptions are made in this analysis , _",
    "e.g. _ the validity of the coupling schemes , the truncation of the ope at dimension-6 and the perturbative contribution at @xmath144 , the form of the instanton contribution _ etc_. that our final result is of the correct size reassures us that none of our assumptions are too far off the mark .",
    "going further and taking it foregranted that the isoscalar - scalar correlator is indeed directly related to @xmath135 scattering , then the sum rules provide an independent determination of the average light quark mass , as given in eq .",
    "our result is quite compatible with sum rule determinations in the pseudoscalar sector and with the early unquenched lattice estimates that are starting to appear in the literature .",
    "we can then be certain that the @xmath3 is the dominant contribution to the @xmath145 current .",
