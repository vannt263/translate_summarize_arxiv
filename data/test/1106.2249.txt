    "the interaction of strong ( moderately ) laser radiation with the matter produces a number of significant processes that include the harmonic generation .",
    "the latter is of particular interest because of importance and potential applications of tunable , coherent , intense high - frequency radiation .",
    "generation of high - order laser harmonics is a well - approbated process in the systems composed by atoms or small molecules and modeled most successfully by a `` three - step recollision '' physical picture @xcite .",
    "the three - step theoretical models for high harmonic generation does not include any participation of excited bound states in the emission of high harmonics and is essentially valid for harmonics with energy well above the ionization energy @xcite .    on the other hand , various studies have shown that for the certain systems such as quantum wells and large molecules @xcite , bound - bound transitions are more important for harmonic generation than the coupling between the ground and the continuum state @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of harmonic generation without ionization can not provide high - frequency radiation , e.g. x - ray , but can be more efficient for generation of moderately high harmonics , in particular , for uv / vuv applications @xcite . for description of strong light scattering process via bound - bound transitions ,",
    "resonant interaction is of interest .",
    "apart from its pure theoretical interest as a simple model , the resonant interaction regime may allow to increase considerably the efficiency of frequency conversion .",
    "harmonic generation by a resonantly driven two - level atom has been studied in @xcite . however",
    ", a two - level atomic system meets difficulties since the required for efficient multiphoton resonant excitation laser fields are so strong that many atomic levels and continuum will play important role @xcite .",
    "so , two - level atomic system is not a good quantitative model for description of atomic response in case of multiphoton - resonant excitation .",
    "nevertheless , in some atomic and especially molecular systems one can avoid the difficulties with efficient multiphoton excitation based on the two - level model .  as it has been shown @xcite ,",
    "the multiphoton resonant excitation of a quantum system subjected to a strong laser field is effective when the quantum system has permanent dipole moments ( pdm ) in the stationary states .",
    "otherwise , the energies of the excited states of a three - level atom should be close enough to each other and the transition dipole moment between these states must be nonzero .",
    "furthermore , these systems have an advantage , which allow to generate radiation with frequency much lower than laser frequency @xcite .",
    "the effects of diagonal dipole elements on harmonic generation at the one - photon resonance has been considered in @xcite__. _ _ however , for efficient generation of moderately high harmonics by optical pulses one should consider systems with the bound - bound uv / vuv transitions and , therefore , the multiphoton resonant interaction regime is of special interest .",
    "the coherent scattering spectrum of a two - level system possessing pdm at multiphoton resonant excitation has been considered in ref .",
    "however , the presented in this paper analytical results for radiation spectrum have only qualitative character , in the meantime , the numerical calculations have been performed for such strong fields which break the condition of multiphoton resonant excitation ( see below eq .",
    "( [ applic ] ) ) and also could lead to detrimental ionization in real atomic / molecular systems .    in the present paper , coherent light scattering by two - level polar molecules at multiphoton resonant excitation in the field of a moderately strong laser radiation is investigated .",
    "it is shown that the study of this process is important for efficient population transfer , generation of moderately high harmonics , as well as for generation of low - frequency radiation , specifically , for realization of intense smoothly tunable terahertz radiation sources .",
    "a simple analytic expression for the time - dependent mean dipole moment , taking into account the dynamic stark shifts , is obtained . in particular , based on this expression results , concerning the main spectral characteristics of considering process , are in good agreement with results of performed numerical calculations . the effect of compensation of dynamic stark shift on the radiation spectrum is considered .",
    "we compare the spectra of two - level systems with and without pdm and show the advantages of polar systems for efficient generation of desirable radiation .",
    "special attention is paid to generation of coherent low - frequency radiation in such systems , particularly , smoothly tunable , intense terahertz radiation    it should be noted that the obtained results may be interesting for different type coherent light sources , such as polar gases , certain organic crystals or quantum dots and etc . @xcite . besides",

    "iii we present some results of numerical calculations of the considered issue without multiphoton resonant approximation and compare the obtained spectra with analytical results .",

    "we consider a two - level quantum system possessing pdm driven by a time - dependent , intense laser field .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction of the laser field with the considered quantum system is given within semiclassical dipole approximation by @xmath0@xmath1here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the energies of the stationary states @xmath4 and @xmath5 of unperturbed molecule , @xmath6 . in eq .",

    "the diagonal terms in ( [ interact ] ) describe the interaction due to the pdm and are crucial for effective multiphoton coupling .",
    "the technique which we employ in our calculations has been described earlier in @xcite .",
    "first we obtain dynamic wave function of the system in the pump laser field , i.e. , the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation with hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . from these solution",

    "the destructive effect of the latter can be compensated by an appropriate detuning : @xmath47replacing the probability amplitudes in ( [ dev2 ] ) by the corresponding expressions ( [ avg1 ] ) and ( [ avg2 ] ) , one can derive the final analytical expression for @xmath48 . as is seen from eqs .",

    "since large dynamic stark shifts make difficult the maintenance of considerable population transfer , here we consider systems with @xmath51 .",
    "taking into account the smallness of the parameter @xmath52 , from ( [ dev2 ] ) in the first order of approximation by the small parameter @xmath52 we obtain the following compact analytic formula:@xmath53 ,   \\label{main}\\]]where@xmath54@xmath55describes the low - frequency part of the spectrum , and@xmath56@xmath57describe harmonic radiationas we can see from ( [ sin])-(cos ) , the harmonic spectrum consists of triplets , with harmonic and two hyper - raman lines with frequencies displaced by @xmath58 . from ( rabi1 ) follows that frequencies of hyper - raman and low - frequency lines can be smoothly tuned via variation of the laser field strength and detuning .    the expression for @xmath48 shows that intensities of the harmonics mainly determined by the behaviour of bessel function.since the bessel function @xmath59 steeply decreases with increase of index @xmath60 , then the cut - off harmonic @xmath61 is determined from the condition @xmath62 .",
