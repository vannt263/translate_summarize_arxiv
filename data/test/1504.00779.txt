    "within the last 30 years , the sub - field of ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ; @xmath1 ev ) astronomy has emerged as a vibrant experimental and theoretical sub - field within the larger field of particle astrophysics , comprising studies of both charged and neutral particles at macroscopic kinetic energies .",
    "the physics interest in uhecr lies in understanding i ) the nature of the cosmic accelerators capable of producing such enormously energetic particles at energies millions to billions of times higher than we are capable of producing in our terrestrial accelerators , ii ) the details of the interaction of uhecr with the cosmic ray background , evident in the observed energy spectrum of cosmic rays as an upper ` cut - off'@xcite , or maximum observed energy , at approximately @xmath2 ev , and iii ) correlations in the arrival directions of uhecr with exotic objects such as neutron stars , gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "experimentally , charged - particle uhecr astronomy is currently dominated by two experiments  the southern hemisphere pierre auger observatory ( pao)@xcite based in malargue , argentina and the northern hemisphere telescope array ( ta)@xcite based in utah , usa . the construction of these observatories is very similar , based on a large number of ground detectors sampling the charged component of extensive air showers ( eas ) and deployed over hundreds of square kilometers at @xmath31 km spacing , coupled with a much smaller number of atmospheric nitrogen fluorescence detectors having a much more restricted duty cycle , but individually capable of providing a more comprehensive image of atmospheric shower development . within the last decade , the pao has been complemented by an array of radio - wave antennas , capable of measuring the signal generated primarily by the separation of the charged particles comprising the down - moving air shower in the geomagnetic field@xcite .",
    "the tara experiment ( telescope array radar ) attempts to achieve large aperture for eas detection by bi - static observation of radar reflections from the core of an eas at radio frequencies .",
    "the radial charge density of a developing eas varies roughly with distance ; within a radial distance of roughly 1 cm of the shower axis , the charge density within that shower core is sufficiently high that a radio - reflective plasma can develop .",
    "if that plasma is sufficiently long lived , it will coherently scatter radio signals in the forward direction ; such forward scattered radio signals are , in principle , detectable at distances of tens of km .",
    "straightforward geometric considerations lead to the expectation that , since the total pathlength from 54.1 mhz transmitter@xmath4shower core@xmath4receiver typically decreases with time for a down - moving shower , the received radar echo doppler - redshifts by approximately 50% over a period of several microseconds , resulting in a radio - frequency `` chirp '' with slope of order several mhz per microsecond . the chirp rate , in terms of the distance from shower to receiver , and also",
    "the relative inclination angle of the shower is a strong function of geometry , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chirprate ] .    the chirp can be characterized by several parameters , including the average chirp slope [ mhz / s ] , the rate of change in the chirp slope ( i.e , the time derivative of the slope [ mhz / s / s ] ) , as well as the initial , final , and maximum detectable chirp rate values .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : crate ] , the change in the chirp slope is also tightly coupled to event geometry , as expected , so that the event geometry can , to some extent , be constrained by the observed chirp parameters .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we first outline the general features of the expected signal characteristics , which form the basis for our monte carlo simulations .",
    "we then review the evolution of the tara project , with particular attention given to the remote station concept and hardware details .",
    "the performance of the current two - station configuration , including a local calibration source is then described , concluding with a prospectus for the future .",
    "to characterize the expected signals , the tara remote station data is simulated @xcite by accounting for the effects of the shower properties and event geometry , atmospheric properties including local gas density , and the characteristics of the receiving antenna .",
    "once the primary energy and the geometry are specified , the shower properties ( such as shower maximum - _ @xmath5 _ ) are derived from the gaiser - hillas prescription@xcite .",
    "the radio cross - section of the shower ( rcs ) is affected by the event geometry , and is modeled as a thin wire with a radius of order 12 cm .",
    "the length of the wire is governed by the plasma charge density@xcite . the induced plasma charge density and lifetime , in turn , are determined by several effects , the strongest of which are collisional damping of the plasma electrons with atmospheric molecules , and attachment of the plasma electrons to oxygen molecules through two and three - body attachment mechanisms@xcite .",
    "accounting for these effects at typical air shower altitudes yields plasma lifetimes of 10 - 100 ns .",
    "the radiation patterns of the receiving and transmitting antenna arrays are incorporated into the simulation after careful field and anechoic chamber measurements of both the angular orientation and frequency dependence@xcite .",
    "the phase and amplitude of the transmitted 54.1 mhz carrier are tracked , and updated once the observable rcs of the air shower enters the fresnel zone of the transmitter - receiver system .",
    "the frequency evolution of the reflected signal is also directly tracked , based on the non - relativistic change in path length from transmitter to shower core to receiver .      to derive event parameters such as zenith angle",
    ", a neural network analysis has been built around the output waveform properties .",
    "the power of the reflected signal versus time is governed by the development of the rcs and the bi - static radar equation , which is then modulated by the phase to produce the final waveform in the receiver .",
    "the simulation predicts 100 - 1000 @xmath6 for the rcs , depending on parameters like the zenith angle , and the carrier incident angle with respect to the thin wire . to provide a realistic sampling of potentially detectable air showers , three thousand telescope array surface detector ( sd ) events",
    "were passed as inputs to the chirp simulation , which requires zenith angle , azimuthal angle , and energy .",
    "the simulated chirp waveforms are then de - chirped as in the remote stations ( delaying a copy and mixing to find low - frequency monotone , as detailed below ) .",
    "the chirp rate , maximum voltage , most powerful frequency , and chirp rate derivative , as measured by a single simulated station with vertical and horizontally polarized receivers , were tracked versus time for each event .",
    "those parameters are passed finally to a 30-node by 4-layer neural network , with , e.g. , in the case of fig [ jchfig ] , the target parameter being the shower zenith angle .",
    "the neural network uses the levenberg - marquardt training technique , and attempts to minimize the mean - squared error between monte carlo truth and network output , using between 40 - 80 percent of the data to train . the final error ( deviation between input and reconstructed zenith angle )",

    "initiated in 2011 with a 2 kw transmitter , tara upgraded to a 40-kw transmitter in 2013 , operating at a carrier frequency of 54.1 mhz . within the last two years , concerted studies of background and calibration of performance have been conducted and documented@xcite , using the primary receiver system located at the site of the telescope array fluorescence detectors .    to enhance the sensitivity of tara , at a location largely free of episodic impulsive backgrounds , we have designed and deployed two solar - powered , autonomous remote stations ( rs ) , each operating with a power draw of approximately 15 watts .",
    "each remote receiver station is designed to detect chirp echoes with signal to noise ratios ( snr ) as low as -10 db .",
    "the remote stations combine a custom front - end antenna with a custom data acquisition system , with separate logic for event triggering and waveform capture .",
    "each station also includes both a power source as well as the capability to broadcast captured data back to the primary telescope array fluorescence detector site via a ghz communications data link .",
    "the first element of each rs is the front - end log periodic dipole antenna ( lpda ) , with outputs separately for vpol and also hpol signal .",
    "beyond this , each rs comprises five basic components : the mixer module to translate an input chirp signal into a triggerable monotone , the chirp acquisition module ( cam ) to record input chirp waveforms having sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , a transient detector apparatus ( tda , which simply registers the number of excursions over a ten - second interval above a pre - set voltage threshold ) to provide simplified threshold - crossing information for the input signals , and two slow - control devices , including the ivt ( current voltage temperature ) board and the overall system health monitor ( shm ) electronics .",
    "an rs block diagram is presented in fig .",

    "development of the rs system was completed in three stages : i ) installation of rs-1 on june 28 , 2014 at latitude=39.2427 n , longitude=113.0896 w , approximately 5 km from the main telescope array fluorescence detector site ( fig .",

    "[ fig : rs1_rs2 ] shows the two remote stations in their final configuration ,    with rs-2 to the left ; note the displacement of the antennas from the electronics boxes , to suppress locally generated noise , relative to the original configuration of rs-1 .",
    "the expected azimuthal angular resolution for reconstruction of distant point sources follows from the absolute timing resolution in each of the stations , which is achieved by counting the number of clock ticks of the local 200 mhz clock in each fpga from the local pps ( pulse per second ) gps signal ( with a resolution of @xmath910 ns ) to the time of the trigger latch , which is therefore discretized in 5 ns bins .",
    "the overall timing resolution is therefore of order @xmath10 , or about 16 ns , corresponding to an angular resolution of order 3m/60 m , or 3 degrees in azimuth .",
    "although this is of the same order as the beam width , it is , nevertheless , sufficiently small to discriminate backgrounds arising from outside the effective signal volume .    a discussion of the front - end antenna , including design , modelling and calibration has been presented elsewhere@xcite , therefore the remainder of this paper consists of a survey of the remaining components , in sequence , with performance benchmarks presented , where possible .      before triggering ,",
    "the raw input signals must be frequency - filtered and amplified in order to suppress known backgrounds ( e.g. , the known fm band ) and also to ensure that the signal strength is comfortably within the dynamic range of the signal digitizer .",
    "the mixer module therefore includes splitters ( zmsc-4 - 1-br , mini - circuits ) , filter ( slp-1.9 + , mini - circuits ) , amplifier ( zfl-500ln+b , mini - circuits ) and bias tees ( zfbt-4rg - ft , mini - circuits ) as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : chirp_fft ] [ fig : dechirp_fft ]      the expected value of chirp slopes from eas echoes are typically between -10 to -1 mhz/@xmath22s . consequently , and based on the previous discussion , a 100 ns time delay between the initial input signal and the delayed copy results in a down - converted signal with frequency between @xmath3100 khz and 1 mhz . to trigger on such signals , it is advantageous to split the mixed signal into multiple copies , each of which is then passed through a distinct band - pass filter and a subsequent envelope detector .",
    "different frequency bands are then compared by majority logic in an fpga , requiring a trigger criterion of no more than two adjacent frequency bands above threshold .",
    "this trigger criterion is designed to suppress broadband impulsive noise , which will typically fire all four bands .",

    "is directly related to the signal chirp rate , that monotone is band - passed into four distinct frequency bands prior to discrimination .",
    "this is done to both ensure that the chirp rate is within a range commensurate with that expected for a cosmic ray , as well as to obtain a first estimate of the chirp rate itself .",
    "a trigger signal is asserted only if the monotone power , as measured by the envelope detector , exceeds some adjustable , pre - set threshold @xmath23 .",

    "as of mid - november , 2014 , the tara transmitter has been rotated from its initial hpol configuration into a vpol configuration , designed to better match the preferential polarization from directly vertically descending showers .",
    "data will be accumulated for approximately one year with the current tara configuration , consisting of a national instruments flex - rio - based daq located at the main tara data - taking building in longridge , ut , plus the two remote stations described herein . as mentioned herein , the radar cross - section is directly related to the size of the reflective plasma along the shower axis ( `` shower core '' ) ; that plasma density is predicted by sophisticated air shower simulation packages such as corsika .",
    "if the radar cross - section is equivalent to that predicted by corsika simulations for a typical 10 eev uhecr - induced extensive air shower , these stations should observe tens of events per month at the -10 db trigger threshold achieved in the lab .",
    "conversely , the lack of definitive uhecr observations via radar reflections will result in constraints on the effective air shower radar cross - section , or , alternately , the lifetime of the putative shower core reflective ionization plasma .",
    "in such a case , mechanisms such as collisional damping of the coherent plasma response due to interactions with local gas molecules , or even loss of charge in the core plasma due to recombination of plasma charge with gas molecules ( likely oxygen , which has a higher electron affinity than nitrogen ) may render an unfavorable outlook for the continued development of this approach in - air . nevertheless , the technique may still offer promise for application to showers developing in solid media such as ice , as has been suggested elsewhere@xcite .",
