    "the nature of spin correlations and their relationship to superconductivity in layered cuprates remains controversial .",
    "this is not due to a lack of experimental studies , as there has been considerable progress in characterizing the magnetic excitations@xcite ; rather , the challenge is one of interpreting the results in the absence of a satisfactory model for itinerant antiferromagnetism in a strongly - correlated system .",
    "a complementary problem is that of understanding the pseudogap phenomena observed in electronic spectroscopies.@xcite in the absence of a fully predictive model , we can continue to explore and extend the experimentally - identified trends , and make comparisons with predictions of simplified models .",
    "one of the established trends is the development of an `` hourglass '' dispersion in under- to optimally - doped cuprates.@xcite as suggested by the name , low - energy and high - energy excitations disperse outwards from the energy  characterizing the waist of the hourglass , with the dispersions centered about the antiferromagnetic wave vector .",
    "a particularly interesting result has been observed in the  ( ybco ) family .",
    "there the cuo@xmath3 planes have an orthorhombic symmetry such that orthogonal cu - o bonds are not equivalent .",
    "neutron scattering measurements on arrays of detwinned single crystals have revealed that the excitations below  have only two - fold rotational symmetry about , whereas the excitations at energies above  have at least four - fold rotational symmetry.@xcite the reduced symmetry below  has been associated with the concept of nematic electronic correlations.@xcite at the same time , the downward dispersion in  with @xmath4 is only resolved at temperatures below the superconducting transition @xmath5,@xcite which has encouraged interpretations that it is associated with the spin - resonance feature of the superconducting state.@xcite note , however , that nematic anisotropy of low - energy spin excitations in crystals with @xmath6 has been mapped to @xmath7.@xcite    in the  ( lsco ) and  ( lbco ) systems , the dispersion of excitations below  is readily observed at @xmath8,@xcite and in the case of , in particular , the excitations connect to incommensurate magnetic superlattice peaks.@xcite the latter point provides motivation to associate the dispersion with excitations about a stripe - ordered state.@xcite unfortunately , it has not been practical to test the rotational symmetry of the excitations in superconducting lsco or lbco due to constraints of crystal symmetry .",
    "such a measurement would be valuable in testing theoretical models .",
    "starting from a state with charge and spin stripe order , the simplest sort of model to consider involves the magnetic moments only and ignores the charge carriers , treating the system in terms of spin ladders with a weakened coupling across the charge stripes .",
    "the anisotropy of the striped ground state imprints itself in the magnetic dispersions , showing up at all energies.@xcite averaging over twinned stripe domains@xcite or allowing for disorder@xcite can restore the four - fold symmetry at high energy , but also forces its presence at low energy . a calculation based on the time - dependent gutzwiller approximation applied to the hubbard model does slightly better , but still exhibits two - fold symmetry at all energies.@xcite hence , stripe - based calculations thus far have not been able to describe the combination of two - fold and four - fold symmetry observed in .@xcite this leaves us with the question of whether the symmetry recovery in ybco is incompatible with stripe correlations or simply with the stripe models considered so far .",
    "an opportunity for testing the anisotropy of magnetic dispersions in  occurs in the `` spin - glass '' regime , @xmath9 .",
    "elastic neutron scattering measurements have established that the incommensurate spin modulation , oriented along the diagonal of a cuo@xmath3 plaquette for this doping , has a unique orientation with respect to the orthorhombic axes of the crystal lattice.@xcite note that the orthorhombic axes in this case are along the plaquette diagonals , with @xmath10   , leaving the orthogonal cu - o bond directions equivalent .",
    "we will specify wave vectors in terms of the orthorhombic cell , so that @xmath11 .",
    "the incommensurate modulation is along the [ 010 ] direction .    by performing inelastic neutron scattering measurements on a crystal with a single orthorhombic domain , it is possible to test the character of the spin excitations . in previous experiments using a triple - axis spectrometer to measure nearly - single - domain crystals ,",
    "we have shown for lsco @xmath12 and 0.025 that the low - energy spin fluctuations ( @xmath13  mev ) exhibit an anisotropic dispersion inwards towards  from the elastic incommensurate peaks.@xcite measurements at energies above  established the upward dispersion but were not adequate to resolve the symmetry .    in the present study",
    ", we return to the @xmath12 sample and probe the spin excitations with the time - of - flight chopper spectrometer sequoia at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) . beyond reproducing the anisotropy of the low - energy dispersion ,",
    "we demonstrate that the excitations above  form a spin - wave - like cone centered on .",
    "thus , we confirm in an lsco crystal the energy - dependent symmetry change of the spin excitations first detected in ybco,@xcite and we argue that the behavior is , therefore , compatible with stripe correlations .",
    "we also present further triple - axis measurements that characterize the thermal evolution of the low - energy ( @xmath13  mev ) magnetic spectral weight .",

    "the bulk of the inelastic scattering measurements were performed on the time - of - flight chopper spectrometer sequoia @xcite installed at the sns , oak ridge national laboratory .",

    "the magnetic correlations are known to be rather two - dimensional ( 2d ) , with no dependence on momentum transfer perpendicular to the cuo@xmath3 layers . @xcite as a consequence , this configuration allows the dispersion relations in the corresponding @xmath23 plane to be measured without rotating the sample .",

    "the holes doped into the planes in our lsco @xmath12 sample frustrate the static order , and effectively push much of the associated spectral weight out to finite energy .",
    "thus , the pile up of weight at low frequency can be viewed as quasi - elastic scattering associated with the glassy order . above 20  mev ,",
    "@xmath61 plateaus at a magnitude comparable to that in the antiferromagnet.@xcite    in the case of superconducting lsco near optimal doping , a gap develops at low energy , with weight moving into a peak centered at 18  mev ; a second peak in spectral weight occurs near @xmath63  mev.@xcite for our case of @xmath12 , the quasi - static antiferromagnetic order would appear to be an obstacle to superconducting order .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath61 for @xmath64  mev has been determined by triple - axis measurements ; the results are indicated by filled and empty squares and triangles in fig .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the time - of - flight data at low temperature . as temperature increases , the quasi - elastic peak decreases and disappears by 100  k , where the resistivity begins to develop a metallic temperature dependence.@xcite the previous study@xcite showed that the incommensurability of the low - energy excitations also decreases with temperature .",

    "we implied in the introduction that the study of lsco with @xmath12 has relevance to stripe physics .",
    "the incommensurate spin modulation is certainly compatible with spin stripes ; however , a corresponding charge modulation has not been directly detected .",
    "the possibility that the spin modulation corresponds to spiral order has been proposed.@xcite given the disorder in the system , spiral correlations are likely present ; however , a pure spiral has an instability to amplitude modulation in the presence of charge inhomogeneity.@xcite furthermore , the drastic impact on antiferromagnetic ordering of a rather small density of doped holes suggests that the doped holes induce a strong frustration that is inconsistent with a uniform spiral order . indeed ,",
    "the low - temperature optical conductivity of lsco with @xmath12 is quite anisotropic , with a bigger gap along the @xmath66 axis , the direction of the spin modulation , and a reduced gap along the @xmath67 axis.@xcite further evidence for glassy charge order comes from studies of resistance noise,@xcite and we note that the spin order occurs well below the temperature at which the in - plane resistivity begins an insulator - like upturn.@xcite a recent model indicates how diagonally - oriented charge - stripe - segments , with associated vortex and antivortex spin textures in the antiferromagnetic background , can collectively produce a stripe - like texture that is compatible with experiment.@xcite    diagonal spin modulations have also been detected recently@xcite in the spin - glass regime of bi@xmath68sr@xmath69cuo@xmath70 ; however , they are not unique to cuprates .",
    "diagonal stripe order has been observed widely in layered transition metal oxides doped with holes,@xcite including nickelates,@xcite cobaltates,@xcite and manganites.@xcite the hourglass dispersion of magnetic excitations has been observed in both the cobaltate@xcite and manganite@xcite systems . for the cobaltate and manganite cases ,",
    "the measured spectra are described fairly well by spin - only models when stripe disorder is taken into account.@xcite the magnetic excitations in  do not exhibit a full hourglass spectrum@xcite ; nevertheless , the observed dispersions are reproduced fairly will by spin - wave theory .    while the hourglass spectrum is a common feature , there are several differences between cuprates and the other transition - metal oxides .",
    "first of all , we expect that inelastic measurements on single - domain samples of the other stripe systems would find two - fold rotational symmetry at all energies .",
    "the four - fold symmetry for @xmath71 , first detected in ybco@xcite and now confirmed in lsco , is unusual and challenging to understand .",
    "secondly , incommensurate spin modulations appear in cuprates at very low doping , whereas they only become apparent in the other systems at substantially higher hole concentrations .",
    "for example , in nickelates stripe order has only been detected@xcite for hole concentrations @xmath72 ; this behavior is correlated with the degree of carrier localization .",
    "the doped holes in cuprates exhibit less localization , and hence can develop spatial correlations at a rather low density .",
    "the final difference among materials is superconductivity , which occurs only in the cuprates . to be accurate ,",
    "our lsco @xmath12 does not exhibit superconducting order ; superconductivity only appears for @xmath73 .",
    "it is intriguing to note , however , that a scaling analysis of resistance as a function of doping in an electrolytically - tuned lsco thin film indicates that the superconductor - to - insulator transition involves the localization of pairs.@xcite furthermore , magnetoresistance@xcite and magnetization@xcite studies suggest the presence of superconducting fluctuating on the insulating side of the transition .",
    "on the theory front , scalapino and white@xcite have argued that charge stripes form from paired holes . while they have in mind bond - parallel stripes at higher doping , it is interesting that seibold _",
    "et al._@xcite have integral numbers of hole pairs in the diagonal `` ferronematic '' segments that they propose for modeling the spin - glass phase of lsco .",
    "could the existence of pairing play a role in the restoration of rotational symmetry at @xmath71 ? in the absence of any theory , we put forward a wild speculation .",
    "a hole - rich stripe segment will contain spin degrees of freedom .",
    "if the holes in the segment are paired , then one might expect the spins to form singlet pairs .",
    "the @xmath74 phase shift in the antiferromagnetic background on crossing a charge - stripe segment can minimize the correlations between the spin background and the stripe segment , thus providing some protection to the singlets associated with the hole pairs ; it is this correlation , pinned to the anisotropic lattice potential , that underlies the uniaxial spin - stripe order .",
    "the protection of pairs is important for energies below the singlet - triplet gap , which would be comparable to . above , the antiferromagnetic spin excitations no longer have a twist in them .",
    "a spin flip at any position will effectively create a local triplet that can propagate in an antiferromagnetic background , so that one might expect to recover four - fold symmetry .",
    "we repeat that this is a purely speculative scenario which we offer in the hope of motivating further research .",
    "we have performed quantitative analysis of the magnetic dispersions up to 65 mev in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "it is found that the anisotropic excitations at low energies , in which outward dispersing branches are missing , gradually change to isotropic ones with a conical dispersion relative to , as in the parent compound la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 .",
    "the low - energy @xmath61 develops gradually with decreasing temperature .",
    "interestingly , these observations are similar to behavior first detected in underdoped .@xcite the surprising restoration of symmetry at high energy is in need of a theoretical explanation .    this research at ornl s spallation neutron source was sponsored by the scientific user facilities division , office of basic energy sciences , u.s .",
