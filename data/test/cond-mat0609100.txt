    "the dynamics of fluid particles in an immobile environment has been of fundamental interest to understand anomalous transport processes in confined geometry and porous media  @xcite .",
    "examples include different types of lorentz gas models @xcite , polymers in quenched disorder @xcite , hard  sphere mixtures @xcite and ion  conducting silicates @xcite .",
    "simple model systems that provide a time  scale separation of transport properties among different species are mixtures of small and large particles at high densities . while it is difficult to experimentally realize such systems on an atomistic scale ( for an exception see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is possible to carry out experiments on colloidal suspensions that contain disparately  sized particles . about a decade ago , imhof and dhont @xcite performed dynamic light scattering experiments on a binary mixture of colloidal silica particles with a size ratio of 1:9.3 .",
    "the effective interactions between colloids are hard  sphere ",
    "like , hence phase behavior and transport properties are governed by packing effects .",
    "an interesting finding of imhof and dhont is the existence of different phases where the large particles exhibit a structural arrest , yet the small particles are still mobile .",
    "the simplest case of such a phase could be one consisting of mobile small fluid - like particles in a crystalline matrix of large particles .",
    "it can be realized , at least , in an intermediate regime below the freezing transition .    in this work ,",
    "we use molecular dynamics simulations to study a binary mixture of charged particles with a size  ratio of 1:5 .",
    "similar to the experiments by imhof and dhont @xcite , the system exhibits a phase transition from a fluid to a mixture of crystalline large particles and fluid  like small particles .",
    "when temperature is sufficiently lowered , the small particles are localized and crystallize , eventually , in a sublattice with respect to the large  particle lattice . in the temperature regime between the freezing transition and the final crystallization into a sublattice , the movement of the small particles can be characterized by a hopping motion in an external periodic potential ( created by the large particles ) .",
    "similar to supercooled liquids , a `` @xmath0 relaxation regime '' can be identified in the incoherent intermediate scattering functions @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 the wavenumber and @xmath3 the time ) of the small particles .",
    "these functions show a plateau region between the microscopic regime and the long  time decay to zero . at a given wavenumber , the height of the plateau increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "this indicates that the particles are more and more localized .",
    "thus , the small particles display a kind of delocalization  to  localization transition around the liquid  to  crystal transition of the large particles .",
    "although the effective packing fraction of the small particles , considered in this work , is relatively small , structural correlations among the small particles occur , associated with a complex distribution of single particle potential energies .",
    "the system considered in this work shows various nontrivial features that might be generic for the dynamics in confined geometry and porous media , especially when coulomb  like interactions become important . it can be also realized experimentally in charged colloidal suspensions .",
    "therefore , with a similar system as the one used by imhof and dhont @xcite the predictions of our model could be rationalized experimentally . on the other hand ,",
    "our model considers essentially the motion of mobile particles in a periodic potential",
    ". it should be much simpler to develop analytic theories for this case than for the transport of particles in a disordered potential energy landscape .",
    "charged particles ( colloids ) are modelled by an effective screened coulomb ( or yukawa ) potential , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the distance between particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denote the distance between two particles at contact , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the radius of an @xmath12-particle .",
    "the interaction range is characterized by the screening parameter @xmath13 . in the limit @xmath14",
    ", the yukawa potential corresponds to bare coulomb interactions .",
    "a shifted lennard  jones ( wca ) potential is used to model the excluded volume of the particles : @xmath15 + \\varepsilon , & r\\leq2^{\\frac16 } \\sigma_{\\rm { \\alpha}{\\beta } } , \\label{shiftedlj}\\\\ 0 , & r > 2^{\\frac16}\\sigma_{\\rm { \\alpha}{\\beta}}. \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy parameter @xmath16 is set to @xmath17 . note that the potential , eq .",
    "( [ shiftedlj ] ) , is purely repulsive .",
    "it can be regarded as an approximation to a hard  sphere interaction for two particles at contact .",
    "the binary yukawa system of volume fraction @xmath18 consists of @xmath19 small and @xmath20 big particles in three dimensional space .",
    "the size ratio between them is @xmath21 .",
    "we choose @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and mass @xmath25 .",
    "the yukawa interactions are short  ranged with a fixed value of the inverse screening parameter ( screening length ) @xmath26 .",
    "note that a cut  off is introduced at @xmath27 where potential energies @xmath28 are of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "for the energy parameters , the values @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are chosen .",
    "this choice implies that small and large particles have the same surface charge density . in the following ,",
    "all the physical quantities are measured in units of the large particle s mass @xmath33 , diameter @xmath34 and energy @xmath35 .",
    "the boltzmann constant is set to @xmath36 .",
    "newton s equations of motion for the charged particles are integrated using the velocity form of the verlet algorithm .",

    "at each temperature , the system was first equilibrated in the @xmath45 ensemble by coupling it to a stochastic heat bath .",
    "the equilibration time was sufficiently longer than the time needed to observe a diffusive motion of the small particles ( typically , a factor of @xmath46 longer for @xmath47 , and a factor of @xmath48 for @xmath49 . ) at the lowest temperatures ( @xmath50 ) , the production runs were over 10 to 20 million time steps .",
    "this was not enough to see a diffusive motion of the small particles .",
    "note that for the equilibration at a given temperature , we used a final configuration of the next  higher temperature as an initial configuration .",
    "microcanonical production runs were performed at the temperatures @xmath51 , 2.5 , 2.0 , 1.0 , 0.8 , 0.5 , 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.15 , 0.1 , 0.05 , 0.04 , 0.03 , 0.025 , 0.02 , 0.015 , 0.012 , 0.01 . at each temperature",
    ", eight independent runs were done to improve statistics .",
    "first , we consider partial pair correlation functions @xcite @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) that measure structural correlations between small ( `` s '' ) and large ( `` l '' ) particles .",
    "these quantities are proportional to the probability to find a particle of type @xmath12 at a distance @xmath5 from a particle of type @xmath0 .    upon decreasing temperatures the large particles crystallize around @xmath54 into a fcc lattice structure .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the @xmath55 above and slightly below the freezing transition of the large particles at @xmath51 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "we see that the curve for @xmath57 at @xmath51 shows only tiny differences to that at @xmath56 .",
    "this also holds for the functions @xmath58 at the two temperatures . beyond the first peak the amplitude in @xmath59 and @xmath58 is only slightly different at @xmath56 and at @xmath51",
    "this indicates a fluid  like behavior in the small  small and small  large correlations .",
    "in contrast , the function @xmath60 changes significantly from @xmath56 to @xmath51 .",
    "note that the rather broad peaks at @xmath56 are reminiscent of a pair correlation function of a normal liquid state .",
    "however , a closer inspection of other structural quantities such as the static structure factor shows that the large particles form a fcc crystal and the broad peaks in @xmath60 are due to thermal fluctuations at the relatively high temperature @xmath56 .",
    "this can be also infered from the snapshot at @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one can clearly identify the crystalline planes , which are strongly distorted by the thermal motion of the large particles .    by decreasing temperature from @xmath56 to @xmath61 ,",
    "significant structural changes occur . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , both @xmath60 and the snapshot clearly show the long  range structural order of the fcc crystal at @xmath61 .",
    "the crystalline structure of the large particles is also reflected in the correlations among the small particles at @xmath61 .",
    "the function @xmath57 displays peaks at @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the second peak at @xmath64 is at the same position as the first peak in @xmath60 , which corresponds to the nearest neighbor distance in the fcc crystal .",
    "this indicates the tendency of the small particles to populate a sublattice with respect to the fcc structure of the large particles .",
    "an interesting feature is the rather sharp peak of @xmath57 at @xmath65 .",
    "this is due to the coordination of a small particle with another small particle .",
    "it means that some of the small particles form pairs in a given local site .",
    "note that approximately 75% of the small particles have no nearest neighbor , 20% exhibit a pairing , and 5% of the small particles are two  fold or three  fold coordinated .",
    "the occurrence of the small particles with zero neighbour or pairs in local sites is also reflected in @xmath58 .",
    "the first peak in this function shows a shoulder around @xmath66 , which is approximately the distance between a large particle and the next  nearest small particle of a small particle pair .",
    "the periodic structure of the large particles crystalline matrix is accompanied by fluid  like small particles , at least at high temperatures . to characterize in detail the `` disorder '' in the small  small correlations , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the small particles distribution of single  particle potential energies ( denoted by @xmath67 ) at four different temperatures .",
    "it is remarkable that the main peak in @xmath68 moves to higher energies while temperature decreases .",
    "this means that the formation of the fcc structure by the large particles is not energetically favoured by the small particles as it increases their potential energy on average .",
    "another significant feature of @xmath67 is the emergence of a high  energy tail .",
    "this is magnified in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by a double  logarithmic plot of the data .",
    "this high  energy tail tends to dissappear towards low temperatures .",
    "this is due to the fact that the kinetic energy sets an upper bound for the accessible potential energies .",
    "having discussed static properties of the model , we now turn our attention to transport properties of the small particles in the immobile environment of the large particles . fig .",
    "[ fig4]a displays the small  particle self - diffusion constant @xmath69 as a function of temperature in a double  logarithmic plot ( note that we determined @xmath69 from the mean  squared displacement of the small particles via the einstein relation @xcite ) . as temperature",
    "is decreased from @xmath51 ( i.e.  above the freezing transition of the large particles ) to @xmath61 , the self - diffusion constant decreases by three and a half orders of magnitude .",
    "note that the functional form of @xmath69 can neither be described by a power law nor by an arrhenius behavior .",
    "a detailed description of the small  particle dynamics can be obtained from the incoherent intermediate scattering functions @xmath1 , the self ",
    "part of the time ",
    "dependent density  density correlation function for the small particles @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b this function is shown for different temperatures at @xmath70 .",
    "this wavenumber corresponds to the location of the first bragg peak in the static structure factor for the large ",
    "large correlations .",
    "note that for other wavenumbers a similar behavior of @xmath71 is observed . above the liquid  to  crystal transition of the large particles at @xmath54 , @xmath72 exhibits an exponential one  step decay to zero , as expected for simple liquids .",
    "below @xmath73 , a plateau develops at intermediate times , followed by a _",
    "non  exponential _ decay to zero .",
    "the emergence of the plateau is associated with a caging of the particles . in this case , the small particles are trapped in local potential basins created by the large particles .",
    "the height of the plateaus in @xmath71 ( also called lamb  mssbauer factor @xcite ) measures the localization of the particles with respect to the length scale corresponding to the considered wavenumber @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig4]b that around @xmath73 the small particles undergo a transition from a completely delocalized state ( with vanishing plateau ) to a more and more localized state towards low temperatures . in the light of the potential energy distribution",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the delocalization  to  localization transition of the small particles is related to the gradual disappearance of the high  energy tails .    the plateau sets in by an oscillation . with decreasing temperature , this oscillation and the whole microscopic regime , i.e.  the decay of the curves onto the plateau , shift to the right on the time axis",
    "this behavior corresponds to a softening of the cage towards lower temperatures and is the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
    "further information on the long  time regime and the diffusive motion of the small particles can be extracted from the fourier transform of @xmath71 , the self - part of the van hove correlation function , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 is the probability to find a particle at time @xmath3 at a distance @xmath5 away from the origin at @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , this quantity is shown for different times at @xmath56 and @xmath61 in a linear  logarithmic plot . at the high temperature , we observe a regular behavior , which is similar to that of simple liquids . with increasing time",
    ", the location of the peaks moves continuously to larger distances .",
    "however , the behavior is totally different at low temperatures : at @xmath77 , the correlation function exhibits a single peak . as time goes on , a second peak develops and if one waits until @xmath78 five peaks can be identified .",
    "the distance between the peak maxima is around @xmath79 , which corresponds to the lattice constant of the large particle s fcc lattice .",
    "we can conclude from this that at low temperatures the small particles do not diffuse in a continuous manner but discontinuously in time by hopping along the sublattice sites of the large particle s fcc lattice .",
    "note that this interpretation has been first given for similar features in the glassy behavior of a soft  sphere model by roux _",
    "et al . _",
    "we have presented an extensive md simulation study of a binary yukawa mixture with size ratio 1:5 . in this system ,",
    "interesting phase behavior is observed where the crystallization of the large particles is accompanied by a dynamic delocalization  to  localization transition of the small particles .",
    "we speculate that this kind of phase behavior is generic for broad classes of complex systems , in particular mixtures of disparate ",
    "sized ( charged ) colloids ( see , e.g. , the experiments by imhof and dhont @xcite ) . the motion of proteins in lipid cubic phases @xcite might be also very similar to that of the small particles in our yukawa mixture .",
