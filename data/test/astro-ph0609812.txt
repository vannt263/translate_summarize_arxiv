    "the relative proximity of the galactic center ( henceforth gc ) provides a unique opportunity for `` close - up '' study of processes that are expected to be crucial in the formation of galaxies and black holes , yet remain essentially unobservable in more distant galaxies .",
    "recent advances in telescope technology have enabled us to resolve individual stars in the crowded gc environment , and the development of adaptive optics has allowed determination of both velocities and positions of such stars to be made with ever - increasing accuracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these new data have presented several puzzles , notably the presence of a number of b - type stars very close ( @xmath4pc ) to the gc , and also the detection of one , and possibly two , coherent rings of massive o- & b - type stars at somewhat larger radii of @xmath5pc @xcite .",
    "these stars are known to be young , and are therefore presumed to be the result of recent star formation at or close to the gc .",
    "the environment at the gc is vastly different from the typical environment of ongoing star formation in the solar neighborhood , with much larger pressures , densities and temperatures , as well as strong tidal forces , so study of the formation of these stars raises a number of interesting issues ( see also the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "a popular theory for the origin of these rings of stars is that they formed via fragmentation of accretion disks around the central black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stars are assumed to form on nearly circular orbits , as a result of gravitational instabilities in the disk .",
    "@xcite suggests that this will lead to a stellar mass function that is significantly more top - heavy ( i.e.  with significantly more massive stars ) than that seen elsewhere in the galaxy , and recent observational studies suggest that this is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "other suggestions for the formation of these stellar rings exist , however , most notably the infalling star cluster scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario can also result in a significantly top - heavy mass function , due to mass segregation and stellar collisions within the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we consider the dynamical evolution of a ring of stars such as those observed around the gc .",
    "previous models of the stellar dynamics of such a ring have considered a single stellar mass population @xcite , or the effect of processes such as resonant relaxation @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the effects of the stellar mass function on the evolution of the system , and use observational determinations of the stellar orbital parameters to constrain the mass function of the stellar rings .",
    "we find that the distribution of eccentricities can tell us about both the upper and lower ends of the stellar mass function , and discuss the consequences of this result for theories of star formation in the gc environment .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : analytic ] we present a simple analytic model for the dynamical evolution of a mass - segregated ring of stars orbiting a massive central black hole . in section [ sec : numerical ] we describe numerical simulations of such a system , and compare the results to the predictions of our analytic model .",
    "we then apply our model to the gc system ( section [ sec : gc_app ] ) , and derive constraints on the initial conditions by comparing our model to recent observations .",
    "we discuss the consequences of our results , and the limitations of our analysis , in section [ sec : dis ] , and summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "let us first consider the relaxation of a system of @xmath6 stars of mass @xmath7 , orbiting in a disk around a black hole of mass @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) .",
    "the disk ( or ring ) is centered at radius @xmath10 , with a radial width @xmath11 and a one - dimensional stellar velocity dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the velocity dispersion is isotropic .",
    "this is not strictly valid , but it has been shown that the ratio of the radial and vertical velocity dispersions can not become larger than 3 without the system becoming unstable @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time for such a system is given by @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where @xmath14 is the stellar density , @xmath15 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath16 is an order - of - unity constant that depends on the geometry of the system .",
    "( for a spherical system @xmath17 , @xcite . )",
    "the stellar density is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale - height of the disk .",
    "we can express @xmath20 in terms of the stellar velocity dispersion and the orbital angular velocity of the disk , @xmath21 , and so for a keplerian disk we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the keplerian orbital period at @xmath10 , and we have absorbed a factor of 2 into the constant such that @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the relaxation of the system is governed by @xmath25 this form for @xmath26 allows the velocity dispersion to increase indefinitely , and in reality a cooling term should be included .",
    "however , this cooling arises when stars at the high - velocity tail of the distribution begin to escape from the system , and is only significant once the velocity dispersion becomes comparable to the orbital velocity . in our application of this model to the gc",
    "we are only interested in the behavior of the system at relatively early times , and in this case this simpler treatment remains accurate .",
    "the effects of this simplification are discussed in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we now extend this analysis to consider two different mass classes of stars , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and velocity dispersions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , stellar number @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and mean energies per particle @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "each mass class is subject to the `` self - relaxation '' described above , but in addition energy can be exchanged between the classes .",
    "this type of analysis has previously been used to study the evolution of a distribution of planetesimals around the sun , and detailed calculations have been made ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite point out that the treatment of this problem depends on whether the velocity dispersion of the light stars , @xmath31 , is greater than or less than the hill velocity of the heavy stars , @xmath36 .",
    "the hill velocity is defined as @xmath37 where the hill radius @xmath38 . in the former case , referred to as the `` dispersion - dominated '' regime , the velocity dispersion is a good approximation for the speed of a single star and scattering encounters are well approximated by two - body dynamics . however , in the latter case , known as the `` shear dominated '' regime , the tidal gravity of the central black hole is important : in this regime the interactions are rather more subtle .    in applying our model to the gc system ( see sections [ sec : numerical ] & [ sec : gc_app ] ) , we adopt @xmath39m@xmath2 and @xmath40pc .",
    "consequently , the keplerian orbital speed is @xmath41 km s@xmath42 , and the hill velocity scales as @xmath43 thus @xmath44 , so the hill velocity corresponds to orbits with very small eccentricities . in our models ,",
    "@xmath45 at all but extremely early times , so we work in the `` dispersion - dominated '' regime throughout . by considering energy conservation in a two - body interaction , we can write the form for the `` exchange '' term as @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the mean of the two velocity dispersions ( and therefore the mean collision speed ) , @xmath48 is the appropriate coulomb logarithm for such a collision , @xmath49 is another order - of - unity constant , and the factor of 6 in the numerator arises because we are considering the energy rather than the velocity dispersion . we can then use @xmath50 to find expressions for the relaxation of the two velocity dispersions : @xmath51 @xmath52 here we have rewritten the constant terms for clarity , expressing them as @xmath53 for @xmath54,2 .",
    "the form of the exchange term can be considered as the product of a relaxation time ( containing three powers of @xmath55 , as in equation [ eq : t_rel ] ) , a volume scaling term which accounts for the different thicknesses of the two disks ( @xmath56 ) , and a normalized energy difference . as mentioned above ,",
    "similar analyses are common in the study of planet formation . in this context other factors , such as physical collisions , are also significant , but if we neglect these terms we can compare the results to our model .",
    "the form of the solution is the same , and by comparison to the three - dimensional analysis of @xcite we see that that the constants @xmath57 and @xmath49 are related by the ratio @xmath58 .",
    "we adopt this ratio throughout .    from these equations",
    "we can make some qualitative inferences about the evolution of this system .",
    "we see from equation [ eq : t_relax ] that the `` self - relaxation '' of the heavy stars will be more rapid than that of the light stars . however , this holds for any mass function @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( the salpeter slope is @xmath61 ) , and is therefore true for all cases considered in this paper .",
    "] , so we expect the transfer term to boost the velocity dispersion of the light stars , @xmath31 , while at the same time damping the velocity dispersion of the heavy stars @xmath30 .",
    "however , the rate at which this energy transfer occurs depends on both the velocity dispersions and the distribution of mass in the system . in equation [ eq : sigma1 ] the damping term opposes the self - relaxation term when @xmath62 , and we see that the evolution of the heavy stars can be dominated by the damping term only if @xmath63 . since @xmath64 is at least of order @xmath30 , this means that the damping term can dominate if the total mass in light stars is greater than the total mass in heavy stars . in the case of the light stars , however , the exchange term acts in the same sense as the self - relaxation term , so we always expect the light stars to relax more rapidly than they would in isolation .",
    "this simple two - component model shows that , in the absence of other factors such as tidal and resonant effects , the stellar mass function is the critical factor in determining the relaxation of a stellar disk .    in order to make detailed studies of the effect of a real mass function ,",
    "it is necessary to extend this analysis to at least three mass classes .",
    "we add a third class with @xmath65 , and consider three exchange terms of the form seen in equation [ eq : ex_term ] ( 12 , 13 and 23 ) . in this case",
    "we see that the heaviest stars are damped by both lighter mass classes , while the velocity dispersion of the intermediate stars is boosted by the heaviest stars and damped by the lightest stars , and the lightest stars are boosted by both heavier mass classes .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses is critical to the evolution , but by considering three classes we can now emulate the effect of massive stars , which may only live for some fraction of the lifetime of the system .",
    "we apply this `` three - class '' model to the galactic center system in section [ sec : gc_app ] .",
    "our analytic model is rather simple , so in order to assess the validity of this approach we have conducted a number of numerical simulations .",
    "we use the @xmath66-body stellar dynamics code developed by @xcite , treating both the black hole and the stars as point masses .",
    "this code uses a hermite integration scheme , which enables us to retain high numerical accuracy .",
    "great care must be taken when using an @xmath66-body code to analyze such a problem , as the energy of the system is overwhelmingly dominated by the central object . if we assume that the stars have typical separation @xmath19 , then the ratio of the typical energy of a stellar encounter to that of the star ",
    "black - hole system is approximately @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , for 10m@xmath2 stars orbiting a @xmath68m@xmath2 black hole in a disk with aspect ratio @xmath69 , the energy binding the stars to the black hole is some @xmath70 times larger than the typical energy of stellar encounters .",
    "consequently , we require very strict limits on the energy errors resulting from the numerical integration if we are to maintain accuracy in our simulations .",
    "this requirement , combined with restrictions on computational time , limit us to modeling systems with relatively few stars , typically 150 or fewer .",
    "m@xmath2 , @xmath71m@xmath2 and @xmath72 .",
    "the three grey curves show the results of the @xmath66-body simulations for three different random realizations of the initial conditions , and the black curve is the mean of these three realizations .",

    "we first consider a single mass of stars , in order to determine the value of the numerical constant @xmath57 in equation [ eq : t_relax ] ( and indeed to test whether a single constant is appropriate ) .",
    "we consider systems of 50 stars , orbiting around a black hole of mass @xmath74m@xmath2 .",
    "we set up the initial conditions as follows .",
    "the stars are distributed in a radial region between @xmath750.15pc ( i.e.  a ring with radius @xmath76pc and width @xmath77pc ) , with uniform distributions in both radius and azimuth .",
    "the stars are given a gaussian distribution in @xmath78 , with scale - height @xmath79 .",
    "all stars are given zero - eccentricity keplerian orbital velocities in the @xmath80@xmath81 plane , with zero velocity in the @xmath78-direction , and this system is then integrated .",
    "we first consider a stellar mass of @xmath82m@xmath2 .",
    "we generated three sets of random initial conditions , and integrated each for 6000 orbital periods at @xmath10 ( @xmath83yr for the parameters specified ) .",
    "each model was computed using two different energy error tolerances , in order to check the numerical convergence .",
    "the cumulative fractional energy errors were typically @xmath84 in one case , and @xmath85 in the second case . translating the cumulative energy error into a measure of the reliability of the results",
    "is not straightforward , but in both cases we consider the estimated energy errors to be sufficiently small .",
    "we computed the orbital elements of each particle twice every orbital period in order to plot the results .",
    "figure [ fig : ecc_m25_n50 ] shows the evolution of the root - mean - square ( henceforth rms ) eccentricity in the simulations .",
    "the rms eccentricity is evaluated from the simulations by computing the instantaneous eccentricity of each star directly from the orbital elements .",
    "the discrepancy between the mean values obtained from two sets of simulations ( different error tolerances ) is around 15% , and is comparable to the differences between different random realizations of the same simulation .",
    "furthermore , this discrepancy is also comparable to the typical random fluctuations expected ( @xmath86% for @xmath87 ) , so we consider the simulations to be numerically converged .",
    "we see that the rms eccentricity of the stars rises from zero to around 0.15 after 10myr , and we are able to compare the results of the simulations to the analytic model presented in section [ sec : analytic ] . in a disk of small objects orbiting a massive central body , the rms eccentricity of the small bodies ( stars ) can be related to their velocity dispersion by @xmath88 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where @xmath89 is the keplerian orbital speed .",
    "we performed a simple least - squares fit to determine the best - fitting value of the constant @xmath57 .",
    "we evaluate the model fit by integrating equation [ eq : sigma_star ] numerically .",
    "the coulomb logarithm is evaluated as the ratio of the maximum to minimum impact parameters .",
    "we assume that the maximum impact parameter is @xmath11 , and the minimum is @xmath90 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the best - fitting value is @xmath93 ; the `` high - resolution '' simulations give @xmath94 .",
    "however , we note that the velocity dispersion , and therefore the rms eccentricity , depends only on @xmath95 , so this apparently large discrepancy in the scaling constant corresponds only to around a 10% uncertainty in the velocity dispersion . by comparison",
    ", the more detailed analysis of @xcite suggests that @xmath57 lies in the range 1.92.8 , depending on the degree of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion , so we are satisfied that our simplified analytic form for the `` self - relaxation '' term is accurate to within 1015% .",

    "thus the total mass in light , 10m@xmath2 stars is double that in heavy , 50m@xmath2 stars , so we expect the eccentricities of the heavy stars to be damped significantly . for comparison",
    ", we also consider a system with @xmath100m@xmath101 only .",
    "once again we evaluated three random realizations of the initial conditions for each ; the typical cumulative fractional energy errors were @xmath103 .",
    "however , with many more stars it was not practical to run a full convergence test in this case . runs with more stringent error constraints , which were run for much shorter times , suggest that these simulations have relaxed somewhat too rapidly , and that the accuracy of these simulations is around @xmath104% .",
    "however , we note that this comparison only considers the early evolution , where the velocity dispersion is rising very steeply .",

    "the analytic model provides an excellent fit to the comparison ( @xmath100m@xmath101 only ) simulations and , as expected , the eccentricities of the heavy stars in the two - class model are significantly damped .",
    "the analytic curves are slightly below the simulated data , but we suggest that this is a result of slightly insufficient numerical accuracy in the simulations . even with this caveat , the agreement is good both in terms of the relative eccentricities of the two mass classes and the absolute numerical scaling .",

    "the upper panel shows the case where the heaviest ( 125m@xmath2 ) stars are simply removed at @xmath129myr .",
    "the solid line shows the case of a salpeter mf , truncated at @xmath118m@xmath2 ; the dashed line shows the case of a top - heavy mass function ( @xmath119 ) , also with the same low - mass cutoff .",
    "the lower panel is the same , but in this case the heaviest stars were subject to progressive mass - loss as specified in equation [ eq : massloss ] . in both cases",
    "we see that a top - heavy imf is required in order to produce rms eccentricities ( in the 25m@xmath2 stars ) larger than around 0.15 . ]",
    "this simple treatment of the gc system is unlikely to be valid , however , as stars born at the upper end of the imf are subject to significant mass - loss during their lifetimes .",
    "moreover , it is unlikely that stars of greater than @xmath130m@xmath2 will live for longer than 23myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of a supernova blast wave on the dynamics of the stellar rings is negligible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the removal of the massive stars from the system can have a significant effect , as they are no longer able to excite the velocity dispersion of lower mass stars .",
    "we use two crude approximations to account for mass - loss and/or stellar death in our simple model .",
    "our first approach is simply to assume that the most massive stars are not subject to any mass - loss , but are removed from the system at the end of their lifetimes .",
    "we adopt a lifetime of 3myr for these stars , and model this by setting @xmath131 from @xmath129myr onwards .",
    "our second approach is to include mass - loss from the most massive stars .",
    "this is done simply by making the stellar mass @xmath27 a time - dependent function @xmath132 .",
    "the details of mass loss from very massive stars are not well understood , but the qualitative effect of mass - loss on the dynamical evolution of the system is not strongly dependent on the mass - loss rates adopted . for simplicity",
    "we adopt the mean mass - loss rate for wr stars derived by @xcite : @xmath133 we use this form for the mass - loss rate @xmath134 for @xmath135m@xmath2 , and assume that the stars mass remains constant once it drops to 25m@xmath2 .",
    "this results in a rather rapid decline in the mass of the heaviest stars , with the mass @xmath132 falling from @xmath136m@xmath2 to 25m@xmath2 in 1.25myr .",
    "we note , however , that this form was derived from observations of wr stars , the most massive of which were around 50m@xmath2 , and so is of uncertain validity at very large stellar mass .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massloss ] .",
    "we see that the consequence of including mass - loss is , as expected , that the eccentricities of the observable stars are not excited as highly as in the case when no mass - loss was included .",
    "the exact eccentricities achieved are rather sensitive to some rather poorly - defined parameters in the model , namely the mass - loss rates and also the upper cutoff of the mf . however , in broad terms we see that the typical eccentricities of the observable stars are expected to be in the range @xmath00.3 , depending on the details of the upper end of the mf .      taken together , these results have important consequences for the gc system .",
    "as noted above , @xcite find typical eccentricities in the clockwise ring of around 0.20.3 , and in the counter - clockwise ring of @xmath137 .",
    "our analysis has shown that , in order for the observed stars to reach even the moderate eccentricities seen in the clockwise ring , there must be a significant population of much more massive ( @xmath1m@xmath2 ) stars present in numbers greatly exceeding those expected from a salpeter mf .",
    "we also find that the total mass in low - mass ( @xmath114m@xmath2 ) stars must be less than the mass in ob stars in order to avoid significant damping of the eccentricities of the ob stars .",
    "thus we conclude that the clockwise system has a rather top - heavy mass function , in agreement with the previous observations of @xcite and @xcite , and find that the observed eccentricities are in agreement with those expected from star formation in a keplerian disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted in section [ sec : basic ] , however , the much larger eccentricities in the counter - clockwise system @xcite pose a problem for our model . even in a `` best - case '' model , with no mass - loss from the heaviest stars , and a very top - heavy mf ( @xmath138 ) extending to very high stellar mass ( 175m@xmath2 )",
    ", the observable 25m@xmath2 stars only reach an rms eccentricity of 0.5 in 10myr , and more realistic models suggest that rms eccentricities greater than 0.4 are unlikely ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_ecc ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the counter - clockwise system was probably not formed from an initially circular disk , and suggest that some other mechanism must be responsible .",
    "as noted above , our model assumes initially circular stellar orbits , but it may be possible to produce larger eccentricities if the initial configuration of the system has significant eccentricity . such a configuration is also possible in the infalling cluster scenario @xcite . within the disk fragmentation scenario",
    "it may be possible to generate eccentric initial conditions if the disk is itself eccentric when it fragments . if the disk is formed by some individual `` accretion event '' , such as the capture of a molecular cloud ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then an eccentric stellar disk can form if the fragmentation timescale is shorter than the circularization timescale of the disk .",
    "models of eccentric accretion disks have shown that a disk can typically remain eccentric for many orbital times @xcite , so rapid fragmentation of such a disk may indeed provide a mechanism for generating the large observed stellar eccentricities .",
    "we note also that eccentric initial conditions may retain an observable signature , in the form of a significantly anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "observations of the stellar disk(s ) at the center of m31 suggest significant , coherent , eccentricities , and models of eccentric stellar disks have been shown to fit the observed data well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the central black hole in m31 is approximately 100 times more massive than that in the galaxy , so an eccentric stellar disk will retain a preferred eccentricity vector for a much longer time in m31 than at the gc . however , detailed study of this problem , and associated issues to do with the evolution of initially coherent eccentric stellar disks , is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "our model predicts that few , if any , stars should be scattered inwards from the rings at 0.1pc , and we therefore make no attempt to explain the origin of the so - called `` s - stars '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which orbit much closer to the gc ( at a radius of @xmath139pc ) .",
    "it has been suggested that these stars may have been scattered inwards from the rings by an intermediate - mass ( @xmath140@xmath70m@xmath2 ) black hole @xcite , but our model does not make any prediction in this regard .",
    "we note , however , that such an interaction would provide an additional means of exciting eccentricity in the stellar rings , and therefore may provide another means of generating the large eccentricities observed in the counter - clockwise ring .",
    "there are several obvious limitations to our analysis .",
    "our model assumes that the velocity dispersion is isotropic , and while this assumption is not unreasonable it is not strictly valid .",
    "similar analyses applied to planetesimals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that in equipartition the radial velocity dispersion is roughly double the vertical dispersion .",
    "our simulations are complicated by the fact that our initial conditions have zero velocity dispersion in the radial direction ( keplerian orbits ) , but non - zero dispersion in the vertical direction due to the finite thickness of the ring .",
    "the system does not reach equipartition over the timescales considered , but the general trend seems to be in broad agreement with previous analyses .",
    "this suggests that our relation between the velocity dispersion and the disk thickness is not exact , but we note that the manner in which we fit the scaling constant @xmath57 enables us to account for this .",
    "furthermore , we find good agreement between the model and the simulations , so we do not consider anisotropy in the system to be a significant problem .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : analytic ] , our analytic model does not allow for cooling , and consequently does not permit an equilibrium solution . as long as the velocity dispersion remains small relative to the orbital speed ( i.e.  the rms eccentricity remains small ) this approximation is valid , and this is supported by the favorable comparison between the analytic model and the @xmath66-body simulations .",
    "this approach may result in an over - estimate of @xmath141 ( and therefore the eccentricity ) if @xmath141 becomes large .",
    "however , the largest eccentricities attained by any of our models are @xmath142 , so we do not consider this to be a significant problem .",
    "we also neglect cooling via physical stellar collisions , but note that at the stellar densities considered here this is unlikely to be significant .",
    "similarly , although we consider only the `` dispersion dominated '' regime for our two- and three - class models , we note that our initial conditions ( with circular orbits ) lie in the``shear - dominated '' regime .",
    "however , the relaxation of the system to the dispersion - dominated regime is very rapid , typically occurring within @xmath143 orbits , so we are satisfied that this simplification does not affect the results significantly .    as noted in section [ sec : two_class ] , the convergence of our `` two - class '' numerical simulations is rather marginal , with tests indicating that the relaxation of the system is somewhat too fast .",
    "unfortunately it is not practical to run more stringent simulations with this type ( hermite ) of numerical algorithm , and is it not clear if more efficient algorithms ( such as tree - codes ) will provide sufficient accuracy to study this problem .",
    "our tests suggest that the accuracy of our simulations is likely no better than @xmath144% , but we are satisfied that this level of uncertainly does not affect the qualitative results of the model .",
    "we also note , as above , that our treatment of mass - loss from massive stars is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "however , the two models chosen span a significant fraction of the available parameter space , and more extreme parametrizations do not alter our conclusions significantly .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : analytic ] , our model neglects other dynamical effects such as tidal and resonant effects , and also treats the black hole as a point mass with a newtonian potential . at the large radius considered here ( 0.1pc )",
    "the timescale for relativistic precession of orbits is much longer than the age of the system , so we can safely neglect relativistic effects .",
    "( the expected precession rate is a few degrees in 10myr : @xcite . )",
    "moreover , the non - keplerian component of the potential due to either remnant black holes @xcite or other stellar populations at the gc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not expected to be significant .",
    "the effect of resonances on the gc system has recently been studied by @xcite , who find that resonant relaxation can in fact dominate over the type of uncorrelated two - body interactions considered here .",
    "they note , however , that the stellar disks observed at the gc are sufficiently young as to be unaffected by resonant effects . the fact that our model , which neglects resonant effects , provides a good fit to our numerical simulations supports this conclusion",
    ". it may well be that resonant effects will dominate the future evolution of the stellar rings at the gc , but in the early stages of evolution considered here they do not .",
    "in this paper we have considered the dynamical evolution of rings of stars around a massive black hole . through analytic arguments and numerical simulations",
    "we have constructed a model for the evolution of a disk of stars of different masses , and shown that the stellar mass function is the dominant factor in determining the evolution of such a system .",
    "we have then applied our analysis to rings of stars observed to orbit the galactic center system .",
    "we find , in agreement with previous studies , that the total mass in low - mass ( @xmath114m@xmath2 ) stars must be significantly lower than expected from a salpeter mass function , and also find that a significant population of massive ( @xmath1m@xmath2 ) stars must have been present in order to produce eccentricities in the range 0.20.3 , as observed by @xcite .",
    "however , we find that dynamical relaxation alone is unlikely to produce rms eccentricities larger than @xmath145 in the gc system .",
    "consequently we conclude that rings with larger eccentricities , such as the counter - clockwise system observed by @xcite , are unlikely to have originated in a circular disk , and suggest that some other dynamical process must be responsible for such systems .",
    "alternatively , we suggest that star formation by fragmentation of an eccentric accretion disk could produce the observed eccentricities .",
