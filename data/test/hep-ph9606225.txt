    "it appears now technically feasible to operate the future high energy @xmath2 colliders @xcite in the @xmath3 and @xmath0 mode @xcite .",
    "this last possibility will allow a detailed study of the non abelian nature of the electroweak interactions @xcite : triple and quartic gauge boson couplings as well as the coupling of gauge bosons with the higgs particle if it is light enough to be produced .",
    "one of the most important processes to be studied will be w pair production . at high energies ,",
    "the cross section is dominated by @xmath1 channel virtual w exchange and becomes nearly constant for a center of mass energy above @xmath4 gev , with a value of about @xmath5 picobarns . with the aimed luminosity in the range of @xmath6 inverse femtobarns per year about one",
    "millions of w pairs are expected .    since the w boson decays within the detector the experimental signature for w pair production is via its decay products , mostly four fermions in the final state . in view of the forecasted production rate , to address precision studies it is necessary to compute the rate for the process @xmath7 .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the process @xmath8 has been studied . in this paper",
    "i present a systematic study of leptonic four fermion final states at a @xmath0 collider including the effect of fermion masses .",
    "the amplitude for the processes in tables [ xxcc ] , [ xxnca ] and [ xxncb ] is computed using a new technique which , in collaboration with _",
    "f. caravaglios _",
    "@xcite , i have recently developed . exploiting the relation between the one - particle irreducible green functions generator @xmath9 and the connected green functions generator @xmath10 we have proposed a simple numerical algorithm to compute tree level scattering amplitudes . we have then implemented the algorithm in a fortran code alpha which presently uses the standard electroweak lagrangian ( qcd is not included yet ) and can compute any scattering amplitude in this framework , in a fully automatic way .",
    "the tests we have performed as well as the computations we have done using the alpha code are described in the previous papers @xcite , it is only worth noticing here that , because of the automatic approach to the calculation , there is no need to check the matrix elements for mistakes and bugs .",
    "the input values , which will be used in the present paper , for particles masses , widths and for the electroweak coupling constants are reported in table [ ew ] .",
    "the gauge bosons propagator @xmath11 is taken as _",
    "b^ = [ rw ] where @xmath12 is the gauge boson four momentum , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the gauge bosons mass and width respectively , and @xmath15 is the riemann @xmath16 function : it is equal to one for positive @xmath17 and zero otherwise .    .",
    "input parameters for the electroweak lagrangian .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the electron muon and tau masses respectively , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the w and z bosons masses and widths , @xmath25 is the weinberg angle and @xmath26 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "tree level relationships among the parameters of the standard model electroweak lagrangian are assumed . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     lepton energies are also relevant and there is a sizable production of low energy leptons .",
    "in fact although disfavored because of the small phase space these events are enanced because lepton pairs with low invariant mass and momentum are produced . in table",
    "[ xsnclepen ] the cross section as a function of several angular and energy cuts is reported for the process @xmath27 .",
    "i have used the recently developed alpha algorithm ( and the resulting code ) to perform a systematic study of the processes @xmath28 which will be relevant at future @xmath29 colliders when operating in the @xmath0 mode .    for those process which proceed via virtual w exchange",
    "( labelled as @xmath30 in the text and in table [ xxcc ] ) the bulk of the cross section is due to the production and decay of a w pair .",
    "another important contribution , at the level of several per cent , arises because of the emission of a collinear fermion and a single w. to perform precision studies the full computation is therefore needed .",
    "when no angular cut is imposed fermion masses act as cut - off of the singularities which occur in correspondence of charged fermions emitted collinear to the beam direction and are therefore relevant .",
    "if a moderate angular cut is imposed fermion masses become almost unimportant .    because of the contribution of @xmath1 channel virtual w exchange of the diagram @xmath31 the total rate is nearly constant for a center of mass energy above 400 gev . when angular cuts are imposed the usual fall - off with the center of mass energy",
    "is observed .",
    "the reactions which proceed only via neutral gauge bosons exchange ( labelled @xmath32 in the text and in tables [ xxnca ] and [ xxncb ] ) present different features according to the charge multiplicity of the final state .",
    "if in the final state there are a neutrino and a charged lepton pairs the bulk of the cross section is due to the @xmath33 diagram when both of the charged fermions are collinear to the beam a z boson is emitted and then decay in a neutrino pair .",
    "the cross section is always below a few femtobarns with the exception of fermions emitted very close to the beam direction where fermion mass effects are important and the cross sections range from a few to one hundred femtobarns    if in the final state there are two pairs of charged fermions the bulk of the contribution comes from the diagram @xmath34 , namely the two photon radiates a pair of almost on shell fermions and two of these fermions undergo compton scattering with its characteristic singularity in the forward direction . since the fermions which scatter have a small virtuality the typical rate of these processes is proportional to @xmath35 times logarithmic enancements . because of the smallness of lepton masses the resulting cross sections are huge and strongly dependent on angular cuts : a relatively mild angular cut is enough to reduce the rate by order of magnitudes .",
    "a final comment is in order here : because of the finite ( and _ running _ widht of massive gauge bosons in ( [ rw ] ) the results i have presented are not gauge invariant . a discussion ( incomplete ) about this issue",
    "can be found in @xcite where it is argued that it is likely that this fact is numerically irrelevant ( in the unitary gauge which is used here ) .",
    "this fact has anyway to be confirmed by an explicit computation which must respect gauge invariance as well as account for gauge bosons widths in a satisfactory way .",
