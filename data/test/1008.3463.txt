    "the theoretical understanding of out of equilibrium systems is one of the main goals in statistical physics .",
    "nonequilibrium phenomena display very rich behavior , with several features not observed in equilibrium , as for example phase transitions in one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions . recently great theoretical progress has been made concerning systems in contact with two reservoirs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for general nonequilibrium systems very little is known .",
    "for some continuous time markov jump processes an ( average ) entropy production can be defined @xcite .",
    "this quantity is zero if detailed balance is fulfilled , which corresponds to an equilibrium stationary sate , and it is positive in the case of a nonequilibrium stationary state .",
    "therefore , a positive entropy production in the stationary state is a signature of nonequilibrium . in spite of the generality of this statement",
    "the relation between entropy production and nonequilibrium stationary states is still poorly understood @xcite .",
    "recent studies in this direction concern the relation between entropy production and nonequilibrium phase transitions , where the entropy production as a function of the control parameter has been observed to peak near the critical point @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a microscopic surface growth model in the kardar - parisi - zhang @xcite ( kpz ) universality class .",
    "the kpz equation reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the position on a @xmath3dimensional interface ( we will be dealing only with the @xmath4 case ) , @xmath5 represents the height of the interface and @xmath6 is a gaussian white noise .",
    "the laplacian term is related to surface tension , @xmath7 is the velocity of the interface at zero slope and the non - linear term is the lowest order term that breaks the up - down symmetry ( @xmath8 ) @xcite . assuming that a nonequilibrium stationary state of a kpz interface is characterized by @xmath7 and @xmath9 , we study how the entropy production varies with these parameters .",
    "we shall argue that this is a reasonable assumption and it allows us to investigate how entropy production characterizes a nonequilibrium stationary state .",
    "we will work with the restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) growth model , because this model has a rich phase diagram and we can perform analytical calculations ( exact and approximative ) .",
    "the positivity of the average entropy production is a statement analogous to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "more generally , it is possible to associate a fluctuating entropy with a single stochastic path @xcite , and the probability distribution of this fluctuating entropy is constrained through the fluctuation relation @xcite , which is a stronger statement than the positivity of the average entropy production .",
    "the fluctuation relation implies the existence of a symmetry of the large deviation function associated with the probability distribution of entropy which is known as the gallavotti - cohen ( gc ) symmetry @xcite .    in general , unlike the entropy production",
    ", other time - integrated currents are not expected to have symmetric large deviation function @xcite . in a growing interface , the physically relevant time - integrated current is the variation of the interface height .",
    "the main focus of this work is to analyze the symmetry of the large deviation function associated with the variation of height using the rsos model .",
    "we find that while indeed no symmetry of the large deviation function exists in the general case , the large deviation function related to the variation of height is symmetric in the case of a four - site system .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that entropy production and height are not proportional to each other in the long time limit . unlike the gc symmetry which results from a certain relation between the rate of each microscopic trajectory and its time",
    "reversed one , this symmetry is a result of a similar relation between the rates associated with certain groups of trajectories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we define entropy and briefly discuss its relation with nonequilibrium stationary states . in sec .",
    "3 we define the rsos model and calculate the average entropy production analytically , analyzing how it depends on the interface velocity and @xmath9 . the fluctuation relation and the gc symmetry are introduced in sec .",
    "4 . in sec . 5",
    "we investigate fluctuations of the interface height .",
    "we show that if a second time - integrated current is considered a fluctuation relation for the joint probability distribution of two currents , with one of the currents being the height , can be found and we also show that for the four - site system the large deviation function related to height is symmetric , displaying a symmetry different from gc symmetry .",

    "time - integrated currents are a functional of the stochastic path , which changes only when the underlying process jumps to a different configuration .",

    "the laplace transform of it is @xmath115 from the master equation ( [ c5eqmaster1 ] ) we obtain @xcite @xmath116 since @xmath117 is a perron - frobenius operator , it is possible to relate the generating function of the time - integrated current @xmath98 with its minimum eigenvalue in the following way , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath117 . the grtner - ellis theorem @xcite states that the large deviation function ( [ rate ] ) is the legendre transform of @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 therefore the gc symmetry ( [ ggc ] ) is equivalent to @xmath121 in the case where the time integrated current is the external medium entropy ( [ c5defentropy ] ) , we have @xmath122 which clearly has the symmetry @xmath123 .",
    "from this condition , follows ( [ symvp ] ) with @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath124 be some equilibrium transition rates related to an equilibrium distribution @xmath125 , where detailed balance is satisfied .",
    "a sufficient condition for a time - integrated current corresponding to transition rates @xmath126 to satisfy the gc symmetry ( [ ggc ] ) , is that a quantity @xmath127 exists , such that these rates take the form @xcite @xmath128 equivalently to ( [ cs ] ) , we have @xmath129 defining @xmath130 as a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath131 , it then follows , from the last relation , @xmath132 which directly gives ( [ symvp ] ) .",
    "we remark that time - integrated currents , such that an @xmath127 satisfying ( [ cs ] ) can be found , are proportional to the entropy ( up to boundary terms ) in the long time limit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath133 therefore , condition ( [ cs ] ) is very restrictive in the sense that very few currents satisfy it .    nevertheless ,",
    "if one considers the joint probability of more than one time - integrated current a more general relation can be found @xcite .",
    "let us take @xmath134 currents .",
    "similar to ( [ cs ] ) , a sufficient condition for a fluctuation relation including @xmath134 currents is that the rates take the form @xmath135 we define the large deviation function associated with the joint probability distribution of the currents @xmath136 by @xmath137 analogously to ( [ defmar ] ) we can define the deformed operator @xmath138 and relation ( [ cs2 ] ) gives @xmath139 from the last relation we have a multidimensional version of ( [ symvp ] ) , which reads @xmath140 in terms of the large deviation function we have the following generalized gc symmetry @xcite , @xmath141",
    "let us consider the rsos model again .",
    "the physically meaningful time - integrated current is the variation of height . along the line @xmath142 the height is just the entropy multiplying @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath142 the probability distribution of the variation of height displays the gc symmetry ( [ ggc ] ) with @xmath144 . for @xmath145",
    "the relation between height and entropy becomes more complicated , and we would like to investigate the symmetry of the large deviation function associated with the probability distribution of height for this case .",
    "in other words , we would like to know if a symmetric large deviation function ( related to height ) is a general property of the rsos model or if it holds only for specific microscopic rules ( @xmath142 ) . in the rest of this section",
    "we show that if a second time - integrated current is considered , fluctuation relations for the joint probability of two time - integrated currents that holds in the whole phase diagram can be found .",
    "we then proceed to analyze the symmetry of the legendre transform of large deviation function associated with height for small systems ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "we introduce the time - integrated currents @xmath147 and @xmath148 which are defined in the following way .",
    "the increment @xmath149 of @xmath147 is @xmath102 for an evaporation taking place with rate @xmath49 , @xmath101 for the deposition related to the reverse transition , and @xmath150 otherwise . in a same way ,",
    "the increment @xmath151 of @xmath152 is @xmath102 for an evaporation taking place with rate @xmath56 , @xmath101 for the deposition related to the reverse transition and @xmath150 otherwise .",
    "note that , in the present case ( [ cs2 ] ) is verified on the form @xmath153 then , relation ( [ frseveral ] ) becomes @xmath154 in order to include the height as a current we note that in terms of @xmath147 and @xmath152 , the height variation ( multiplied by the system size @xmath35 ) , @xmath155 , is given by @xmath156 hence , ( [ hqphq ] ) implies in @xmath157 the height appears explicitly in these relations and they are valid in the entire phase diagram .",
    "therefore , it is possible to find fluctuation relations for the height if a second time - integrated current is considered .",
    "next , we consider the probability distribution of the variation of height , without a second time - integrated current .",
    "we consider the rsos model for very small system sizes starting with @xmath158 , where the model has 7 states in the charge representation . in order to visualize the network of transitions in this space ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath159 $ ] all configurations which differ only by translation , e.g. @xmath160=\\{+-0,\\,0 + -,\\,-0+\\}$ ] . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : trnet ] , the transitions for @xmath158 form a simple cycle .",
    "although each transition contributes differently to @xmath155 and @xmath99 it is clear from the value of the rates ( i.e. fig .",
    "[ fig : trnet ] ) that for each completed cycle the resulting changes will have the fixed ratio @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , in the long - time limit @xmath162 will be distributed in the same way as @xmath99 and thus trivially displays the gc symmetry .",
    "more precisely , it is possible to find a similarity transformation of the form ( [ c5peqhpeq ] ) with @xmath163 .",
    "( left ) and @xmath0 sites ( right).,width=453 ]    for @xmath0 the situation is different . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : trnet ] , the transition network is a loop consisting of two smaller cycles . if the system passes the whole loop it produces both entropy and height , but if it circulates within the small cycles it generates only entropy .",
    "this means that entropy and height are no longer coupled and are expected to be distributed differently .    to find out whether the distribution of @xmath155 is still symmetric for @xmath0 ,",
    "let us follow the procedure described in the previous section . in the charge basis the deformed evolution operator",
    "@xmath164 turns out to be a @xmath165 matrix of which the lowest eigenvalue has to be found .",
    "the problem can be simplified even further by defining the @xmath166 matrix @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 denote the six sets of charge configurations which differ only by translations and @xmath15 is one of the states represented by @xmath169 . in the basis @xmath170,[--++],[+-00],[+-+-],[+0 - 0],[+00-]\\}$ ] , this matrix reads @xmath171 since the eigenvector corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath164 is translationally invariant , there will be a corresponding eigenvector of @xmath172 with the same eigenvalue . hence @xmath173 can be computed by determining the lowest eigenvalue of the matrix given above .",

    "therefore , the rsos model with @xmath0 sites has a symmetric large deviation function ( associated with height ) .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath173 for the height current  even when appropriately rescaled  differs from the corresponding function for the entropy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : iofs ] ) , showing that entropy and height are not proportional to each other for @xmath88 . in appendix c we present a different proof for this symmetry , without using the matrix @xmath164 .",
    "the gc symmetry has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "it is a result of the fact that the exponential of the variation of the entropy for a given stochastic path is the weight of the path divided by the weight of the time - reversed path ( see @xcite ) . clearly , this is not the case of the height in the rsos model , therefore the symmetry we found for the @xmath0 case is different from the gc symmetry . in appendix",
    "@xmath12 we show that the symmetry is a result of some subtle arrangement of the stochastic trajectories that leads to a variation of height @xmath155 .",
    "hence , we have shown that currents different from the entropy may also have a symmetric large deviation function .",
    "unfortunately , this observation does not extend to @xmath179 , where a small asymmetry in @xmath119 can be observed ( we calculated @xmath119 numerically , directly form the matrix @xmath117 , for @xmath180 ) .",
    "this may be caused by the increasingly complexity of the network of transitions ( see appendix c ) .",
    "in the present paper we studied the entropy production and fluctuation relations for the particular solid - on - solid growth model which belongs to the kpz universality class . on a particular line of the phase diagram , where the model can be solved exactly , we calculated the entropy production , the velocity , and kpz - parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the results are compatible with the idea that @xmath181 and @xmath182 can be used as a measure for the distance from equilibrium .    extending these exact results to the entire phase diagram within a mean field approximation",
    ", we obtained analytical expressions for the lines @xmath58 and @xmath59 which are close to the true lines and exhibit the same curvature .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the entropy production as a function of @xmath9 along the line @xmath58 .",
    "it was found that @xmath74 grows with @xmath181 , again in agreement with the idea that the entropy production gives a measure of the distance form criticality .",
    "as we saw , along the line @xmath142 height is proportional to entropy and therefore its probability distribution displays the gc symmetry .",
    "we showed that if a second time - integrated current is considered a symmetry in the joint probability distribution of two time integrated currents valid in the whole phase diagram can be found .",
    "moreover , we explored the symmetry of the legendre transform of the large deviation function associated with the variation of height for the @xmath146 cases .",
    "for @xmath158 the height turned out to be asymptotically proportional to the entropy , hence it trivially displays a gc symmetry .",
    "a different result emerged for @xmath0 : entropy and height are not proportional in the long time limit , nevertheless the large deviation function related to height is still symmetric . as we showed this a new symmetry different from the gc symmetry .",
    "we would like to point out that the fluctuation relation for the entropy production is very general , holding for any markov process with reversible transitions rates .",
    "contrarily , it is valid for very specific currents , that is , currents that become proportional to the entropy in the long time limit .",
    "here we found an example of a current different from the entropy with a symmetric large deviation function .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate what currents in markov processes , different from the entropy , have a symmetric large deviation function and what may be the physical origin of the symmetry .    *",

    "the second solution @xmath200 , on which we will focus in the following , is much more interesting because it extends to the nonequilibrium regime of the model . in this case",
