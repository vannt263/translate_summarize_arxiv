    "the classic model for fueling bright quasars at high redshift assumes that massive black holes ( mbhs ) are powered by major galaxy mergers , which cause large quantities of gas to be funneled into the regions where mbhs reside ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the result of this process is near - simultaneous bursts of star formation and mbh accretion , which are observed at all redshifts in a large range of galaxy types .",
    "indeed , the peaks in global star formation and quasar activity coincide at a redshift of @xmath3 @xcite , which strengthens the argument that these two phenomena must be connected .",
    "observations support this picture , with growing numbers of observed high - redshift galaxies exhibiting both powerful star formation and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity @xcite .",
    "nearby massive early - type quasar host galaxies are also observed to exhibit signs of a recent major merger @xcite .",
    "a popular suggested paradigm involves a gas - rich major merger triggering a burst of star formation , channeling gas into the central regions of the galaxy , and fueling a powerful agn .",
    "the energy released by accreting gas may unbind the remaining gas from the galaxy , rendering the galaxy `` red and dead '' and eventually resembling today s massive ellipticals @xcite .    however , there is also evidence for agn activity that is not necessarily merger - driven .",
    "low to moderate luminosity agn hosts tend to be disk - dominated at high redshifts @xcite and in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite postulated that major mergers are the primary drivers of accretion in only the most luminous agn .",
    "furthermore , they suggest that this trend does not appear to evolve with redshift ; moderate - luminosity agn inhabit quiescent galaxies out to @xmath4 .    locally , low - luminosity agn hosts tend to be disk galaxies , which are unlikely to have undergone a recent major merger .",
    "recent studies have examined mbh fueling in local agn and found that gravitational torques are efficient at transporting gas from the galactic disk to the central region @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined a sample of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies and found no evidence for merger events , tidal tails , or disrupted features .",
    "the lack of merger - induced features for these galaxies is a hint that their black hole growth is driven by secular processes rather than interactions with other galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite demonstrate that in a matched sample of seyfert and quiescent galaxies , agn hosts are more centrally concentrated with a larger reservoir or molecular gas , perhaps indicating that active nuclei have simply experienced recently triggered inflowing material .",
    "in addition to secular processes , and especially at high redshifts , mbhs may be fueled by gas which is directly accreted onto a galaxy from the intergalactic medium .",
    "these `` cold flows '' may take the form of filamentary inflows , especially at high redshift @xcite .",
    "such flows fueling mbh growth have been demonstrated in large volume and high resolution cosmological simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "the role of cold flows on mbh growth may be significant among the most massive rare halos , but the effect on more common , less massive halos has yet to be investigated , and is the primary goal of this paper .",
    "the diversity of agn hosts suggests that there exists a diversity of fueling mechanisms .",
    "for instance , while not all agn activity is merger driven , mergers or interactions seem to enhance agn activity @xcite .",
    "properties such as galaxy / halo mass , merger history , gas accretion history , and environment likely all play a role in when and how much mbhs accrete .",
    "thus , the aforementioned paradigm of major mergers fueling mbh growth is likely only a dominant mechanism for a small subset of highly luminous objects .",
    "the question `` how do mbhs grow ? '' is likely a very complex one for black holes in different environments . to address one aspect of this question , we focus on late - type galaxies at @xmath5 which host moderate - luminosity agn .",
    "the advantage of studying mbh growth in cosmological simulations is that one can disentangle effects from major galaxy mergers as well as accretion of ambient cold gas from cold flows / filaments , minor mergers , and secular evolution .    in this work",
    "we separate accretion by mergers and the ambient environment by tracing the history of every gas particle as it enters the primary halo .",
    "furthermore , we differentiate between cold flows and gas which is shocked upon entering the virial radius of the halo .",

    "the abovementioned works demonstrate that we are able to simulate realistic galaxies without the addition of these advanced features ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "while these previous results have not included the effects of agn feedback , our current studies suggest that for galaxies of small to moderate masses ( such as those studied previously and in this work ) the central smbh affects only the central regions of the galaxies and leaves the more global properties intact ; we are thus confident that the simulations presented in this paper are quite consistent with the broad range of observed galaxy properties .",

    "here we set @xmath29 , which achieves reasonable mbh occupation fractions in galaxies without overproducing mbh - mbh merger events ( which results in mbhs which violate the soltan argument , growing almost solely through mergers and not gas accretion ) .",
    "this requirement is broadly consistent with theories of seed black hole formation out of population iii stars @xcite or direct collapse of gas @xcite .",
    "it also ensures that seed black holes cease forming at high redshift , once the interstellar medium becomes polluted with metals from supernova feedback .",
    "multiple black holes may form in a single halo ; additionally , they are not fixed to halo centers but are allowed to react dynamically to perturbations such as galaxy mergers . in order to decrease the effects of artificial two - body scattering , we employ dark matter particle masses that are only slightly larger than the black hole masses , which helps the black holes stay in the centers of their hosts . for more details on seed black hole formation ,",

    "while the focus of @xcite is on the gaseous and stellar buildup of galaxy disks , the gas - tracing methodology can be applied to many scenarios , including the accretion of gas by black holes .",

    "before their accretion onto the primary halo , gas particles are traced to determine if they ever belonged to a halo other than the primary . to define the primary halo , we identify the central mbh of the most massive galaxy at the final step of the simulation .",
    "we then trace this mbh back in time and identify its host as the primary at each step .",
    "if gas particles are already in the primary halo at the first step where halos are identified ( @xmath45 in this study ) , they are labeled as `` early '' accretion .",
    "gas particles that have ever belonged to any halo or subhalo other than the primary halo are labeled as `` clumpy '' accretion , and are generally accreted onto the main galaxy in merger events .",
    "gas that enters the halo in any other fashion is labeled `` smooth '' accretion , which is then divided into two categories , cold and shocked .",
    "smoothly accreted gas particles may or may not undergo a shock within the virial radius of the primary galaxy @xcite .",
    "the presence of a shock depends mainly on the mass of the halo ; generally , gas will shock if the galaxy halo is around @xmath46 m@xmath1@xcite .",
    "thus , since dwarf galaxies are less massive than this threshold , they will never develop a shock . in massive galaxies , the development of a shock",
    "is strongly related to the orientation of the gas flow .",
    "cold gas predominantly flows into halos along the filaments inherent to the large - scale structure of the universe , and these filaments may be dense enough to penetrate a shock front and deliver gas to the central galaxy without heating the gas to the virial temperature @xcite . eventually the filaments dissipate , but for a substantial time these filaments are critical in building up galaxy disks at high redshift @xcite .",
    "shocked gas by definition undergoes an entropy increase , which also manifests as a temperature increase .",
    "thus , gas is identified as shocked if it increases its entropy and density based on these two criteria ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "smoothly accreted gas is traced until it reaches a distance of @xmath53 from the galaxy ; after this point , supernova feedback can mimic the effects of virial shocking , which can no longer be accurately tracked .",
    "any smoothly accreted gas particle that undergoes the above temperature and entropy increases is defined as shocked . those gas particles that reach @xmath53 without these increases",
    "is defined as unshocked ( repeating the calculation for tracking radii larger than @xmath53 gives no substantial difference in our results ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more complete details of the relevant shock physics .",
    "armed with these categories of gas accretion , we determine how mbhs accrete their own gas .",
    "we identify the gas particles which are accreted by the primary mbh in a simulation ( defined as the mbh residing at the center of the primary galaxy ) .",
    "we then cross - correlate these particles with their accretion history .",
    "this process provides a history for the accreted gas particles as they enter the primary galaxy , though does not give any information about which mechanisms govern their journey to the mbh .",

    "figure [ fig : images ] shows simulated sdss @xmath54 images of the primary galaxies in each simulation , which were created with sunrise @xcite .",
    "the images show blue colors and late - type morphologies for all three galaxies .",
    "our three chosen simulations have similar mass and environment .",
    "they each form in gas - rich filaments and accrete gas from this cold flow as well as through galaxy mergers .",
    "however , they have a variety of merger histories ; for example , the largest galaxy ( @xmath55 ) has an active history , undergoing a few major mergers ( defined as mergers with stellar mass ratio 1:3 or larger ) .",
    "the galaxies @xmath56 and @xmath57 are somewhat more quiescent , with mostly minor mergers ( stellar mass ratio between 1:3 and 1:10 ) .",
    "we have chosen these simulations in order to examine how galaxies with different interaction histories may experience different mbh growth . in figure",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] we show the bolometric luminosity vs time for the central mbh in the primary galaxy for each simulation .",
    "we highlight major merger events with red hatched regions , and minor mergers with blue hatching .",
    "mergers are defined to begin when the satellite enters the primary s virial radius , and end when the satellite is disrupted . while each lightcurve is fairly noisy , mergers do not seem to substantially enhance the fueling of low - mass mbhs .",
    "however , major mergers trigger strong agn activity only after the third pericenter passage , when central mbhs are @xmath58 kpc apart @xcite , and our resolution limits our ability to analyze this phase in great detail . at lower redshifts",
    "there are several extremely minor mergers ( with ratios less than 1:10 ) as well as a variety of secular instabilities which occur during each galaxy s evolution ; the mbh appears to undergo at least as many spurts of growth during these episodes as during more substantial mergers .",
    "the mbh in @xmath55 reaches a bolometric luminosity greater than @xmath59 erg s@xmath60 for a duration of 66 myr , or 4.5% of its lifetime , and exceeds a luminosity of @xmath61 erg s@xmath60 for a total of 3.7 myr .",
    "the mbh in @xmath56 spends 15 myr ( 1% of its lifetime ) at a luminosity greater than @xmath59 erg s@xmath60 .",
    "the mbh in @xmath57 experiences very little growth by accretion .",
    "the luminosities of the mbhs in @xmath55 and @xmath56 are comparable to those of nearby seyfert galaxies , but are unobservable at the high redshifts of our simulations .",
    "we show the growth of the primary black hole in the largest galaxy in each run in figure [ fig : bhgrowth ] .",
    "each mbh begins with a seed mass of @xmath10 m@xmath1 , and subsequently grows through merging with other mbhs and via gas accretion .",
    "the purple dashed line indicates the total mbh mass , including the initial seed mass and growth through mbh mergers .",
    "the solid black line represents the total mass gained by gas accretion only .",
    "the colored solid lines show the mass due to gas accretion divided into each accretion mode : unshocked / cold flows ( blue ) , shocked ( red ) , and clumpy ( green ) .    in each galaxy , we see that gas which originated in cold flows dominates the mbh accretion .",
    "this result indicates that gas from other galaxies does not always travel directly to the central mbh during mergers , but may get mixed into the host galaxy s gas reservoir , or delayed in entering the central regions due to an elongated orbit .",
    "cold flow gas appears to be the dominant fuel for mbhs ; we must investigate whether this result is due to cold flows being more efficient mbh feeders , or whether they simply provide the most gas to their host galaxies .",

    "if a halo is comprised of gas hailing from one particular mode of accretion , it follows that the mbh will also accrete the majority of its gas from the same mode . on the other hand ,",
    "if the modal fractions accreted by the mbh are different from those comprising the overall galaxy , we can clarify whether one mode is preferentially accreted over another .",

    "the remainder of the gas in @xmath57 is classified as `` early '' accretion : gas which was already in the galaxy at @xmath45 . for @xmath55 and @xmath56 the early fraction is negligible .",
    "cold flows are generally the dominant source of accretion for both the overall galaxy and the central mbh , followed by gas from mergers .",
    "overall , there is very little difference between the modal fractions of accreted gas for the galaxies and the mbhs .",
    "the stars , on the other hand , seem to show a very slight relative preference to form from merger gas compared to the mbh s preference for unshocked gas ( in relation to the overall galaxy composition ) .",
    "while a detailed study of this phenomenon is beyond the scope of this paper , we suspect that gas entering the main galaxy during a merger may experience a variety of processes which may cause it to form stars ; on the other hand , to feed the mbh it must be channeled to a specific location .",
    "we stress that while these trends are evident for all three galaxies in our sample , the differences are only a few percent .",
    "overall , each black hole tends to accrete more or less the same fractions of smooth- and merger - accreted gas as is contained in its host galaxy .",
    "we explore the evolution of these gas fractions with redshift in figure [ fig : gasfraction ] .",
    "the dashed lines show the instantaneous fraction of gas mass accreted by the mbh in @xmath55 for each accretion mode , while the solid lines show the gas fraction of the galaxy as a whole ( colors are as in figure [ fig : bhgrowth ] , with the addition of gray lines representing `` early '' gas which is within the galaxy at the beginning of the tracing history ) .",
    "mergers , which occur in @xmath55 s history around @xmath63 , have the result of dumping a large quantity of gas into the host galaxy , which also increases the fraction the mbh accretes fairly instantaneously . such behavior is evidence of mergers directly fueling mbh growth at high redshift . on the other hand , at times when the galaxy s accretion as a whole becomes more cold - flow - dominated , the mbh also tends to increase the fraction of cold - flow - originated gas it accretes .",
    "the general trend is that the modal fraction which the mbh accretes is merely whatever is available in the galaxy , with a slight delay in time while the mbh s fuel reservoir adjusts to the composition of the entire system .",
    "( while we show this figure for simulation @xmath55 , the results for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are qualitatively similar . )    to focus on the galaxy center , which is the residence of the mbh , in figure [ fig : starfraction ] we plot the mass fractions of newly formed stars within the central 500 parsecs , categorized by the origins of the gas from which they formed . for each simulation output ( roughly 50 myr apart ) , we determine which stars have formed in the central region since the previous timestep .",
    "in addition we sum the gas mass accreted by the mbh during these same timesteps .",
    "these differential mass fractions of stars and accreted gas show that the fractions of gas which are accreted by the mbh are slightly different than the fractions which result in newly formed stars at each timestep .",

    "* ) ) exhibit large amounts of low angular momentum gas , which can efficiently fuel bright quasars and star formation at high redshift ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the angular momentum content of later - collapsing gas is higher , since it is torqued for a longer period of time .",
    "additionally , lower mass galaxies eject low angular momentum gas via feedback processes more efficiently @xcite due to their shallower potential wells .",
    "therefore moderate - mass halos host lower luminosity agn , fueled less efficiently because the available gas has too much inherent spin .",
    "the evidence for merger activity fueling mbh growth is plentiful , but does not present a full picture . while bright quasars are certainly present in the remnants of gas - rich major mergers , we have shown that mbh fueling at high redshift can occur in a number of ways , and reflects the gas accretion history of the host galaxy .",
    "even so , we have just begun to explore the full parameter space of galaxy mass , redshift , gas content , and merger history , and how these quantities affect mbh growth . additionally , the journey of the gas from the outer edge of the halo to the central mbh is still enigmatic .",
    "torques from mergers and secular processes drive gas inwards , fueling the black hole , but how and when this occurs will be the focus of further study .",

    "<S> using a set of zoomed - in cosmological simulations of high - redshift progenitors of massive galaxies , we isolate and trace the history of gas that is accreted by central supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the origins of the accreted gas , in terms of whether it entered the galaxy during a merger event or was smoothly accreted . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we designate whether the smoothly accreted gas is accreted via a cold flow or is shocked upon entry into the halo . for moderate - mass ( @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) black holes at @xmath2 , there is a preference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has a higher fraction of gas from cold flows . in general </S>",
    "<S> , each black hole tends to accrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger - accreted gas as is contained in its host galaxy , suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomes well - mixed , and its origins are erased . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the angular momentum of the gas upon halo entry is a more important factor ; black holes preferentially accrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy , regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers . </S>"
