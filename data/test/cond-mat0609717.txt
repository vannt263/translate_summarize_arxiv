    "the metal - insulator transition arising from the competition of randomness and interactions remains an intriguing problem in condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , the question of the existence of a metallic phase in two dimensions , for which an experimental consensus had emerged in the 1980 s @xcite has been revisited with new samples over the last decade , with developments which have driven a considerable amount of new theoretical work @xcite .",
    "several interesting lines of study have emerged which explore the interplay of one - body potentials and two - body interactions in more general contexts .",
    "the superfluid - insulator transition has been studied in disordered , interacting boson systems , where the existence of a thermodynamic order parameter , the superfluid density @xmath2 , as well as the greater ease of numerical simulations , has resulted in many definitive results @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of a metal and a mott - hubbard insulating phase in the disordered half - filled hubbard model has been explored using both numerical and analytical techniques @xcite .",
    "the existence of insulating phases away from commensurate fermion filling has been explored in models with bimodal distributions of on - site chemical potential @xcite . finally , the question of metallic phases arising from the addition of correlations to a _ band _ insulator is drawing new attention @xcite .",
    "the commonly cited qualitative picture of the appearence of a metallic phase out of a disordered one is that the interactions act to screen the one - body potential .",
    "while several quantum monte carlo studies of disordered interacting fermions exist @xcite which demonstrate the possibility of a metallic phase , none have looked quantitatively at this screening in the hubbard hamiltonian .    in this paper , we will present results for the conductivity and renormalized site energy of the two dimensional anderson - hubbard model , @xmath3 here @xmath4 are fermion creation(destruction ) operators on site @xmath5 for spin @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath8 is the hopping parameter , @xmath0 the onsite repulsion , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 the global chemical potential and local site energies respectively .",
    "each @xmath10 is drawn independently from a uniform distribution on @xmath11 .",
    "we choose @xmath12 to set our scale of energy .",
    "our key conclusion is that while increasing @xmath0 can drive an anderson insulating phase metallic , there appears to be no sharp signature of this transition in the variance of the renormalized site energies .",
    "this suggests that the metallic phase arises at least partially from an additional mechanism beyond a simple screening of the one - body potential .",
    "we employ the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) method @xcite .",
    "since many descriptions of the approach exist , we only provide a brief sketch here , focusing on those features most relevant to the present study .",
    "dqmc is an exact method to compute the properties of tight binding hamiltonians on finite lattices .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath13 in the partition function is discretized and an auxiliary (  hubbard - stratonovich \" ) field introduced to decouple the interactions .",
    "the resulting quadratic form in fermion creation and destruction operators is integrated out analytically , leaving a sum over the hubbard - stratonovich variables which can be performed stochastically .",
    "we have chosen the imaginary time discretization size small enough such that the systematic `` trotter '' errors are comparable to the statistical errors associated with the monte carlo sampling and disorder averaging . of greater concern in these simulations is the finite lattice size and , in particular , the possibility of a  false \" signal of metallic behavior which would occur if the localization length exceeds the lattice size .",
    "we have verified that in the phases we identify as metallic the localization length ( computed at @xmath14 ) is less than the lattice size .    to investigate the metal - insulator transition",
    ", we look directly at the dc conductivity which we obtain from the current - current correlation function @xmath15\\ e^{-h \\tau } .",
    "\\label{cccf}\\ ] ] we compute the fourier transform @xmath16 of @xmath17 and its correlation function @xmath18 . using the general formalism of linear response theory ,",
    "the dc conductivity is given by @xmath19 the frequency dependent conductivity is given by the integral transform @xmath20    it is difficult to obtain @xmath21 by inverting this integral equation , because it requires the determination of @xmath22 on a very fine mesh of imaginary times @xmath23 with very high numerical accuracy .",
    "however , if we insert @xmath24 in eqn .",
    "[ kernel ] , the function multiplying @xmath21 for low @xmath25 effectively restricts the integral to small @xmath26 , so that we may approximate @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "the frequency integral may now be evaluated analytically , leading to the result : @xmath29    this approximation is expected to be valid when the temperature is smaller than an appropriate energy scale in the problem .",
    "it is convenient because it allows the computation of @xmath30 as a function of temperature to be obtained from the function @xmath22 , which is calculated directly in dqmc .",
    "obtaining a transport property like @xmath31 directly from imaginary time data , as described above , is a process which must be undertaken with caution .",
    "however , the use of this procedure gives the correct characterization as a metal or insulator in all cases which we have checked so far .",
    "for example , @xmath32 is positive ( insulating behavior ) for the half - filled @xmath33 hubbard model without randomness at all values of @xmath0 , that is , regardless of whether the insulating character arises predominantly from antiferromagnetic order ( weak coupling ) or mott behavior ( strong coupling ) @xcite .",
    "the procedure also gives the correct physics in a band - insulator when a staggered site energy is present and @xmath14 .",
    "it has also been shown to give the correct physics of the disordered attractive hubbard model@xcite .",
    "a fundamental check of the numerical data is the verification that the longitudinal current - current correlation function obeys the gauge invariance condition , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the kinetic energy .",
    "we have checked that , as in previous work @xcite this condition is satisfied .",
    "since the disordered site - energies in the system are generated randomly from a uniform distribution @xmath36 , the distribution has zero mean , and a variance :    @xmath37    in order to study the screening of the disordered potential by interactions we note that within a mean - field picture an electron moving in the one body potential @xmath10 will feel the site energy renormalized by the density of oppositely oriented electrons .",
    "that is , @xmath38 which becomes , in the absence of spin - polarization , @xmath39 since for each spin species @xmath40 .",
    "we define an associated dimensionless variance by normalizing to the fluctuations in the original site energies , @xmath41 in the absence of interactions ( @xmath14 ) , or for very large @xmath42 at fixed @xmath0 , we have @xmath43 , indicating that there is no screening of the random potential . the question we wish to address is whether there is some signal , e.g. a noticeable decrease , in @xmath44 on entry into a metallic phase .",
    "we begin by demonstrating that interactions can drive an anderson insulating phase metallic .",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : ud8 ] the dc conductivity as a function of temperature for a fixed strength of the disorder potential and increasing @xmath0 . at @xmath14 ,",
    "@xmath31 decreases as @xmath25 is lowered , indicating insulating behavior .",
    "however , at strong coupling @xmath31 increases as @xmath25 is lowered , indicating a cross - over to metallic behavior .",
    "all results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ud8 ] , and subsequently in this paper , are at one - quarter filling @xmath45 .",
    "this is far away from the most dramatic effects of @xmath0 in the hubbard model- the mott transition and antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the metallic phase in fig .  [ fig : ud8 ] can be caused to return to insulating behavior by increasing the site disorder .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaall2 ] where we begin with the interaction strength which gives the largest conductivity , @xmath46 , and make @xmath42 larger . for @xmath47 the low temperature slope of @xmath31 reverts to insulating character .",
    "an interesting feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : ud8 ] is the non - monotonic behavior of the conductivity .",
    "@xmath31 increases with @xmath0 up to @xmath48 , but then comes down again at @xmath49 . in order to verify that this phenomenon is generic , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ud9 ] data for larger @xmath50 .",
    "we again see that @xmath31 comes down at strong coupling .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in the evolution of the superfluid density @xmath2 for correlated bosons moving in a random potential- a superfluid phase with @xmath51 exists at intermediate coupling , but the system is insulating , @xmath52 , both at weak and strong coupling @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cru4 ] we show @xmath30 vs. the disorder strength for progressively lower temperature values . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the system is metallic and @xmath30 increases as the temperature is lowered , while for @xmath54 , in the insulating state , the behavior is opposite .",
    "the crossing point of the plots demarcates the critical disorder strength .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : crd8 ] , we show a similar crossing plot for @xmath30 as we tune the interaction strength through the metal - insulator transition for a fixed disorder strength @xmath55 ( see fig .  [ fig : ud8 ] ) . a small value of the interaction is seen to be enough to cause the transition to a metal .",
    "interestingly , the conductivity is non - monotonic and decreases for large values of the interaction strength ( the fermion sign problem in dqmc simulations forbids the evaluation of @xmath30 at @xmath56 ) .",
    "it is _ possible _ that there is a crossing at larger interaction strengths , when the system reverts back to an insulator .",
    "such non - monotonic behavior behavior of the conductivity has also been seen in recent dqmc studies of a multi - band hubbard model at half - filling , where the sequence of transitions with increasing @xmath0 is found to be band insulator @xmath57 metal @xmath57 mott insulator .",
    "before showing results for the dimensionless variance of the renormalized site energies , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : demeaned ] a plot of the original and renormalized site energy landscapes .",
    "as expected , the particles preferentially sit on the sites with low @xmath10 , and these larger values of @xmath58 then lead to a smoother @xmath59 . however , there is certainly no very dramatic leveling of the landscape .",

    "we plot the low temperature slope @xmath62 from the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaall2 ] and show its change of sign at @xmath63 .",
    "there is no clear indication of this critical value in the renormalized site energy variance @xmath44 .",
    "we can similarly look for this effect at the metal - insulator transition driven by increasing @xmath0 at fixed @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ud8 ] ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . again",
    ", there appears to be no clear signal of the metal - insulator transition in the screened site energies .",
    "the results from the previous section suggest we look more closely at the physical picture of the smoothening of the site - energy landscape by interactions . our expectation in fig .  [",
    "fig : vardsdt ] where we plotted @xmath44 as a function of the disorder strength was that in the metallic phase at weak disorder there would be a markedly smaller value of @xmath44 , and then a crossover to a larger value as the disorder is increased into an insulating phase . on the other hand , at weak disorder we expect the least inhomogeneity in the site occupations . in the limit of uniform density , at very weak disorder , the site energy variance equals the original one , and @xmath64 , suggesting that @xmath44 might instead @xmath65 with disorder . the conflicting tendency to decrease with disorder as charge - inhomogeneity develops , and increase in the insulating phase ,",
    "might explain why the site energy variance is so insensitive to site energy disorder , whereas when we tune through the transition with interaction strength there is a much larger decline ( though still no abrupt signal at the transition ) .",
    "in this section , we examine an analytically solvable limit of the disordered anderson - hubbard model , that of @xmath66 , which can be considered to be the limit of very high disorder . at this limit",

    "as electrons are added to the lattice at @xmath66 , the sites with the lowest site energies are singly occupied up the fermi energy @xmath73 .",
    "when , however , @xmath73 exceeds @xmath74 it becomes preferable to start doubly occupying the low energy sites .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : renorme ] . from the figure it is evident that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and hence that @xmath77 .",
    "we can easily obtain the mean of the renormalized site energies by averaging eqn .",
    "[ rse ] : @xmath78 .",
    "a completely equivalent result is obtained by recognizing that the energies of the sites on which up spin electrons reside are raised by @xmath0 in the range from @xmath68 to @xmath79 , where down spins are present .",
    "similarly , the energies of the sites on which down spin electrons reside are raised by @xmath0 in the range from @xmath68 to @xmath73 , where up spins are present .",
    "( here the designations ` up ' and ` down ' merely reflect the ` first ' and ` second ' electrons on a site . ) when the energies are averaged over these ranges , the same result for @xmath80 is obtained .",
    "the average of the square of the renormalized site energies is obtained in the same way .",
    "we can then evaluate the dimensionless variance of the renormalized site energies @xmath81 , defined as @xmath82 to determine the variance , we must distinguish between two cases : a _ generic _ one , in which the fermi energy @xmath83 is larger than @xmath71 , and there is double occupancy of the low - energy sites , and a _ non - generic _ case , in which there is only single occupancy , which may happen for a large value of @xmath84 or a small density . for the generic case ,",
    "the variance can be computed in terms of the three energy - scales ( @xmath0,@xmath42 and @xmath73 ) in the @xmath66 problem : @xmath85    the fermi energy ( for the generic case ) can be determined in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath42 by the following equation : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the filling . for example , in the quarter - filled case , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . in the non - generic case , the fermi energy can , of course , be determined by simple state counting .    a plot of @xmath90 vs. @xmath84 is given in fig .",

    "we have examined the metal - insulator transition in the anderson - hubbard model using determinant quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "our focus has been on the evolution of the renormalized site energy through the transition , and we conclude that it exhibits no sharp feature there .",
