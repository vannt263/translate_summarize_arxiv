    "the eddington limit corresponds to a situation where the radiative acceleration outwards equals the gravitational acceleration inwards .",
    "eddington ( 1926 ) originally only considered electron scattering for the opacity ( the classical eddington limit ) , but in an ionization zone of an important element the true opacity can be much higher .",
    "therefore , the opacity - modified eddington limit in stellar atmospheres can occur at significantly greater gravities than the classical eddington limit , as is evident for example from the calculations of lamers & fitzpatrick ( 1988 ) , gustafsson & plez ( 1992 ) and asplund & gustafsson ( 1996 ) .",
    "if hydrostatic equilibrium is required , a stellar luminosity which locally exceeds the eddington luminosity automatically forces the development of a gas pressure ( @xmath2 ) inversion , as seen from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium :    @xmath3    from rearranging the above expression one obtains    @xmath4,\\ ] ]    with the radiative acceleration defined by :    @xmath5    ( e.g mihalas 1978 ) . here",
    "@xmath6 denotes the physical flux and @xmath7 the total mass extinction coefficient ( with dimension @xmath8g@xmath1 ) .",
    "obviously a positive @xmath2-gradient must occur when the eddington limit is encountered if hydrostatic equilibrium is valid .",
    "it should be emphasized that a density inversion does not necessarily imply that the eddington limit is exceeded .",
    "a density inversion predominantly occurs due to a changing molecular weight in the ionization zone of a dominant species , while a @xmath2-inversion reflects a super - eddington luminosity due to high opacity ( asplund et al .",
    "since both are related to ionization they may often occur in the same atmospheric layers , which has probably caused the confusion found in the literature ( e.g. maeder 1989 ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath2-inversions only seem possible to develop in optically thick conditions .",
    "if the radiative acceleration exceeds gravity when lines dominate the opacity , the radiative force is highly unstable to perturbations induced by velocity gradients , since the spectral lines may then absorb unattenuated continuum flux .",
    "therefore , rather than the development of a @xmath2-inversion , a stellar wind will be initiated , which is the case for radiatively driven winds of hot stars .",
    "the aim of the present study is to investigate whether @xmath2-inversions in late - type stars , where the opacity instead is dominated by continuous opacity , are subject to a similar instability which would prevent their existence . before considering possible instabilities , in sect .",
    "[ s : eddlimit ] the derived eddington limit for h - deficient stars is presented and a possible connection between the limit and the declines of the r coronae borealis ( rcrb ) stars is discussed .",
    "the location of the eddington limit in a @xmath9-log@xmath10 diagram can be estimated by model atmosphere calculations ( lamers & fitzpatrick 1988 ; gustafsson & plez 1992 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that these models consistently include the radiative acceleration in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the location of the limit is not obtained by extrapolation towards lower gravities nor does it imply zero density , as has sometimes been claimed in the literature ( e.g. humphreys & davidson 1994 ; nieuwenhuijzen & de jager 1995 ) .",
    "an interesting conclusion from the above studies is that the theoretical opacity - modified eddington limit coincides with the upper luminosity limit for stars ( lamers & fitzpatrick 1988 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that the eddington limit , possibly in connection with rotation ( langer 1997a , b ; owocki & gayley 1997 ) , prevents the evolution of stars into the super - eddington regime by the existence of radiative instabilities",
    ". these may give rise to the eruptions of the luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) ( cf .",
    "humphreys & davidson 1994 ) . here a similar investigation but for the h - deficient rcrb and related stars will be carried out ; a preliminary report can be found in asplund & gustafsson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath2-inversions in such model atmospheres was noted by asplund et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , who speculated that it may be the trigger mechanism for the enigmatic visual declines of the rcrb stars .",
    "the variability of these stars is likely due to the formation of an obscuring dust cloud close to the stellar surface in the line - of - sight , but how the dust condensation can proceed despite the relatively high equilibrium temperatures has long been an enigma ( cf .",
    "clayton 1996 ) .",
    "the presence of shocks seems to be a very promising mechanism for the gas to cool sufficiently and thereby trigger dust formation ( woitke et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the models used here are recently constructed line - blanketed model photospheres with typical abundances of rcrb stars ( asplund et al .",
    "1997a ) . in fig .",
    "[ f : gamma ] the variation of @xmath11 with optical depth is displayed for a sequence of models corresponding to constant luminosity and mass ( e.g. @xmath12l@xmath13 and @xmath14m@xmath13 ) .",
    "the super - eddington luminosities only occur in the deep atmospheric layers where hei ionizes and , as expected , where @xmath2-inversions occur .",
    "since the rcrb stars presumably evolve towards higher @xmath9 ( kilkenny 1982 ) , the stars will move from the sub - eddington regime into having super - eddington luminosities , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ f : eddlimit ] where the theoretical eddington limit in the @xmath9-log@xmath10 diagram is shown . compared with solar abundances the limit",
    "is shifted towards higher @xmath9 due to the higher ionization potential of he compared with h , but also extends to slightly larger log@xmath10 .",
    "the location of the eddington limit for higher @xmath9 has not yet been explored , since a self - consistent hydrodynamical treatment is needed for @xmath15k when @xmath16 occurs for @xmath17 and line opacity may determine @xmath18 .",
    "the exact location of the computed eddington limit will naturally depend on the detailed properties of the model atmospheres .",
    "for @xmath19k convection in the deeper layers of the hei ionization zone restricts the limit to lower log@xmath10 , since the radiative flux diminishes in the presence of a significant convective flux .",
    "also , the lower temperatures decrease @xmath7 and @xmath18 further . including turbulent pressure",
    "would therefore bring the limit towards greater gravities by typically 0.2dex , due to less efficient convection with lower densities .",
    "a c / he ratio of 1% has been assumed on the basis of the measured ratio in extreme helium ( ehe ) stars ( jeffery 1996 ) , which presumably the rcrb stars are related to ( lambert et al .",
    "a higher carbon abundance pushes the eddington limit towards higher gravities the same way as turbulent pressure does",
    ". a lower overall metallicity by 0.5dex would decrease the limit by about 0.2dex by lowering the temperatures in the inner layers with a diminished line - blanketing .      in fig .",
    "[ f : eddlimit ] the estimated parameters of the rcrb stars ( lambert et al . 1997 ; asplund et al .",
    "1997c ) are also shown .",
    "obviously , rather than being randomly located in the diagram as one a priori might have guessed , the rcrb stars fall close to the limit , which suggests that a connection between the declines of rcrb stars and the eddington limit exists .",
    "thus , there is an alluring resemblance between the rcrb stars and the luminous blue variables in their proximity to the eddington limits and their eruptive behaviour ( asplund & gustafsson 1996 ) .",
    "if the rcrb stars are evolving towards higher @xmath9 ( kilkenny 1982 ) and the ehe domain at constant luminosity , their immediate progenitors should be the h - deficient carbon ( hdc ) stars ( lambert et al .",
    "the ehe and hdc stars experience no visual fadings despite being otherwise similar to the rcrb stars .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the reason for the non - variability is that the hdc stars have not yet reached the eddington limit while the ehe stars are located on the stable side of the limit at higher @xmath9 .",
    "if the declines of the rcrb stars are indeed triggered by the super - eddington luminosities , one could expect a correspondence between the maximum value of @xmath11 in the atmosphere and frequency of declines . in the pulsation - induced dust condensation model for the rcrb stars ( woitke et al .",
    "1996 ) , in which the dust formation is triggered by propagating shock waves due to ordinary pulsations , one would sooner expect a correlation with pulsation strength .",
    "intriguingly , v854cen , which is the rcrb star most frequent in decline , has very weak photospheric pulsations ( lawson & cottrell 1997 ) but by a wide margin the largest @xmath11 found of the 18 rcrb stars analysed sofar .",
    "rysgr , on the other hand , has by far the strongest photospheric pulsations but only average amount of declines , which might reflect the fact that @xmath11 is not unusually high .",
    "pulsation may , however , push some stars across the limit by periodically shifting them towards higher @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath20k for rcrb itself ( rao & lambert 1997 ) .",
    "the proposed connection between the eddington limit and the declines of the rcrb stars is certainly not without problems , which deserve to be addressed further .",
    "a few stars seem not to behave as expected if the proposal is correct , in particular this is true for some of the coolest ehe stars and the three hot rcrb stars .",
    "as seen above , a @xmath2-inversion must develop at the eddington limit in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "one should ask , however , whether strong convection may take place to prevent it , since the ionization zone causing the high opacity and thereby the super - eddington luminosities also favours convection .",
    "in fact , a super - eddington luminosity in the diffusion regime automatically requires the presence of convection as shown by langer ( 1997a ) . generalizing langer s derivation for a non - negligible radiation pressure to also include the effects of ionization , the schwarzschild criterion @xmath21 for the onset of convection is equivalent to    @xmath22 % \\right\\ } } % { 1 } \\frac{4\\alpha \\left\\ { 2 + 8\\alpha + x\\left(1-x\\right ) \\left[5/2 + \\epsilon",

    "convection must be initiated as @xmath11(r ) approaches unity , since the right hand side is always less than 1 . thereby the radiative flux and hence @xmath11 diminishes when convection is efficient .",
    "the eddington limit can therefore not be exceeded in adiabatic convection zones in the stellar interior and hence @xmath2-inversions will not develop .",
    "thus , inversions can only be present in non - adiabatic convection zones close to the stellar surface .",
    "it should be remembered that the location of the eddington limit is dependent on the convection treatment .",
    "a @xmath2-inversion will for example disappear if the density scale height is applied instead of the normal pressure scale height for the calculation of the convective flux through the mixing length theory .",
    "the mixing length theory is rarely a good description of stellar convection , and in particular for these extreme situations it may be very misleading .",
    "ultimately , hydrodynamical simulations will be necessary to investigate the effects of convection on @xmath2-inversions .      using the momentum equation one can investigate under which conditions a @xmath2-inversion can exist in the presence of a stellar mass loss . or equivalently : which mass loss rates can one expect from a star if the super - eddington luminosities would instead drive a stellar wind ?",
    "in the presence of a stellar outflow , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be replaced with the momentum equation :    @xmath25    where we have restricted ourselves to the one - dimensional , time - independent case .",
    "also other external forces , such as turbulent forces ( @xmath26 ) and centrifugal forces ( @xmath27 ) , can be contained in @xmath28 besides radiation .",
    "it should therefore be kept in mind that the possibility of an instability may be underestimated when restricting the following discussion to only radiative forces , as other forces also tend to be destabilizing ( e.g. nieuwenhuijzen & de jager 1995 ; langer 1997a , b ; owocki & gayley 1997 ) .",
    "together with a constant , spherically symmetric mass loss rate @xmath29 , and the equation of state , it is possible to rewrite the momentum equation into the so called  wind equation \" :    @xmath30    where the isothermal sound speed defined by @xmath31 has been introduced . by an inspection of eq .",
    "[ e : windeq ] , it is possible to determine under which circumstances @xmath32- or @xmath2-inversions are allowed . in normal cases ,",
    "d@xmath33/dr@xmath34 in the surface layers and therefore the parenthesis on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ e : windeq ] is positive as long as a temperature inversion is not present , which is not possible in optically thick layers with a radiative flux .",
    "therefore , if @xmath35 but @xmath36 , the velocity gradient @xmath37 must be negative . since a constant @xmath38 has been assumed , a density inversion will be present if @xmath39 and therefore a @xmath2-inversion is possible ( though not required ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath40 while @xmath35 , then @xmath37 must be positive , and the density gradient can not be positive : a density inversion can not exist .",
    "since a @xmath2-inversion requires a density inversion , neither inversion can occur in the stellar atmosphere despite the super - eddington luminosities . again",
    "the possibility of a temperature inversion has been neglected .",
    "a sufficient criterion for the disappearance of a @xmath2-inversion is therefore that the outflow velocity due to mass loss is high enough ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the critical mass loss rate can be estimated by comparing @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "the values for @xmath43 and @xmath32 will be taken from static models , which is justified for these rough estimates , since the atmosphere below the sonic point is normally little affected by mass loss . a model atmosphere with @xmath44k , log@xmath45 [ cgs ] and solar abundances requires a critical mass loss rate @xmath46 .",
    "hence @xmath2-inversions can exist in stars despite high mass loss rates .",
    "achmad & lamers ( 1997 ) have arrived at similar conclusions and estimates .",
    "they also verify the finding numerically with dynamical steady state atmospheres , though not altogether self - consistently .",
    "an even higher critical mass loss rate is found for the rcrb stars .",
    "the lack of hydrogen makes the continuous opacity significantly lower than for solar abundances and hence the density at a given optical depth will be correspondingly greater , typically by a factor of 50 ( asplund et al .",
    "since the density is higher , the outflow velocity will be lower in order to carry the same @xmath38 .",
    "a similar model as above but with abundances typical for rcrb stars , will therefore require @xmath47 .",
    "the mass loss rates of rcrb stars are poorly known , in particular since it may be episodic , but rough estimates suggest ( e.g. feast 1986 ) , orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath48 .    it is concluded that @xmath2-inversions are not an artifact of hydrostatic equilibrium but may also exist in dynamical steady state atmospheres , even with a high mass loss rate .",
    "dynamical stability has been extensively studied , in particular in connection with the termination of the agb ( e.g. paczyski & zikowski 1968 ; wagenhuber & weiss 1994 ) .",
    "radial adiabatic oscillations will grow exponentially in time for dynamical instability , which is formally encountered if the first generalized adiabatic exponent    @xmath49    is less than @xmath50 in a region effectively isolated from the rest of the star .",
    "an ideal gas has @xmath51 while pure radiation has @xmath52 , but the combined effect of non - negligible radiation pressure and ionization may push @xmath53 below the limiting value . for dynamical instability to occur , the pressure weighted volumetric mean value of @xmath53 between the depth @xmath54 and the stellar surface @xmath55    @xmath56    must be reduced below @xmath50 in a significant fraction of the star .",
    "stars with a pronounced core - envelope structure and high luminosity - to - mass ratios , like the supergiants investigated here , may show dynamical instabilities in ionization zones ( e.g. stothers & chin 1993 ; wagenhuber & weiss 1994 ) .    in fig .",

    "@xmath60 dominates the total pressure and hence @xmath53 is very close to @xmath50 .",
    "a more complete study for h - rich model atmospheres has been presented by lobel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who arrive at the same conclusions . in the rcrb model",
    "only the hei ionization zone exists , which explains the quite different depth variation of @xmath53 .",
    "the higher temperatures at depth in the h - deficient model make hei ionization occur at smaller @xmath61 .",
    "also seen is the minor effect of the ci ionization zone at @xmath62 .",
    "these models only extend down to @xmath63 and hence it is not possibly to tell how @xmath57 varies further in , though the heii ionization zone will also reduce @xmath53 .",
    "it seems that atmospheres of late - type supergiants are close to being dynamically unstable , or may even be so for sufficiently high luminosity - to - mass ratios .",
    "violent instabilities due to this might lead to ejection of material , as found for the termination of the agb ( wagenhuber & weiss 1994 ) , as well as for the lbvs ( stothers & chin 1993 ) .",
    "also rcrb stellar models seem to suffer from a similar dynamical instability as the stars on the tip of the agb ( a. weiss , private communication ) .",
    "it should be remembered though that the above - mentioned evolutionary studies lack a proper hydrodynamical treatment , and therefore interpreting the instabilities found in the models as actually occurring in the stars must still be made with some caution .",
    "it is clear from the discussion in sect . [",
    "s : pgasinversion ] and [ s : dynamical ] that @xmath2-inversions may exist in stars with high luminosity - to - mass ratios and that such stars are close to being dynamically unstable .",
    "thus , these stars may be vulnerable to radiative instabilities , since the additional destabilization from radiative forces may render them unstable . the existence of radiatively driven sound waves in hot stars due to high @xmath18 has been suggested by hearn ( 1972 , 1973 ) , and further elaborated by berthomieu et al .",
    "( 1976 ) , spiegel ( 1976 ) and carlberg ( 1980 ) .",
    "the instability is based on the increase in opacity upon compression , since the radiation force is in phase with the velocity perturbation and hence causes amplification . for these high temperatures it requires essentially isothermal perturbations , since    @xmath64    here @xmath65 , while @xmath66 is the flux weighted mean opacity .",
    "thus only short wavenumbers will be amplified .",
    "the growth rate is especially high as @xmath11 approaches unity ( berthomieu et al .",
    "1976 ) but the super - eddington case has not been investigated .",
    "carlberg ( 1980 ) found that the instability may provide rapid transfer of momentum from the radiation to the gas with typical growth rates of @xmath67s@xmath1 for @xmath68k .",
    "it is possible that a similar instability is exhibited also in late - type supergiants , with the important differences being the super - eddington luminosities in the @xmath2-inversions and that isothermal perturbations are not necessary , since both ( @xmath69)@xmath70 and ( @xmath71)@xmath72 in the upper layers of the @xmath2-inversions ( fig .",
    "[ f : opacity ] ) .    to study the stability of a @xmath2-inversion a local , linear , non - adiabatic stability analysis has been carried out .",
    "small , sinusoidal perturbations around the equilibrium values are assumed for the temperature , density and vertical velocity :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are small .",
    "the atmosphere is assumed to be static ( @xmath76 ) , since the outflow velocity must anyway be less than the isothermal sound speed for a @xmath2-inversion to exist , as demonstrated above .",
    "the analysis will be restricted to vertical motion and therefore multi - dimensional instabilities of rayleigh - taylor - type will not be found .",
    "carlberg ( 1980 ) investigated also such a gradient instability for hot stars but found slow growth rates compared to the radiatively driven sound waves",
    ". such a gradient instability would resemble convective motion which , however , is already present in the layers of interest in the unperturbed model and is thus not specifically searched for here .",
    "the equations to be linearized are the material equations for conservation of mass , momentum and energy :    @xmath77    ( e.g. mihalas & weibel mihalas 1984 ) , where d / dt , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the lagrangean co - moving derivative , the specific internal energy of the gas , the wavelength integrated planck function ( @xmath81 ) and mean intensity ( @xmath82 ) , respectively .",

    "the effects of radiation are included with a time - independent treatment , i.e. the radiation field is assumed to be quasi - static .",
    "the radiation momentum and energy equations will then look like :    @xmath86    here @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the wavelength integrated eddington flux ( @xmath89 ) and radiation pressure ( @xmath90 ) respectively . in the diffusion regime for the unperturbed atmosphere",

    ". however , the perturbations are not very strongly excited with minimum growth times @xmath156s , contrary to the findings by carlberg ( 1980 ) for hot stars , mainly as a result of the much smaller radiative fluxes ( @xmath157 ) . for the instability to generate large amplification ,",
    "the sound waves must be reflected at the surface and pass through the region with high radiative forces several times .",
    "however , the inwards propagating modes are damped for the same reason as the outgoing are amplified , with the magnitude of the damping rate similar to the growth rate , which suggests that the instability will still not be very efficient . in order to estimate the behaviour of the instability in the global , non - linear regime ,",
    "a more sophisticated study than presented here must be carried out .      in order to gain further theoretical insight into which atmospheric properties contribute to the instability presented above ,",
    "the equations can be simplified by assuming the unperturbed atmosphere to be isothermal and neglecting ionization and scattering .",
    "furthermore , only the limits of optically thin and optically thick disturbances will be studied and hence the combined radiative energy and momentum equation will not be needed .",

    ", the propagation speed will be modified by the neglected terms @xmath177 , though the growth / damping rates will remain the same . for both isothermal and adiabatic perturbations ,",
    "the sound waves are amplified by the action of the radiative acceleration , as long as the opacity increases with temperature and density ( assuming constant radiative flux ) :    @xmath178    furthermore , in a @xmath2-inversion @xmath28 is negative and hence tends to excite an initial disturbance .",
    "however , the normal momentum conservation counteracts this due to propagation in a density stratified medium ; the density inversion will tend to damp the amplitude for outwards propagating waves .",
    "in fact , with this simplified atmosphere and the values in table [ t : values ] , in both models the last term dominates . hence , the amplitude of sound waves will decay as they propagate outwards with these assumptions , despite the super - eddington luminosities and the increase in opacity upon compression .",
    "thus , since the numerical results in sect .",
    "[ s : radinstab ] show amplification for the case without these simplifying assumptions , the effects of e.g. ionization and a temperature gradient tend to work together with the radiative force and its derivatives to overcome the damping contribution from the density gradient .",
    "it has been shown that h - deficient model atmospheres may have radiative forces which exceed gravity , similar to the case of some luminous h - rich stars ( lamers & fitzpatrick 1988 ; gustafsson & plez 1992 ) .",
    "such super - eddington luminosities manifest themselves as @xmath2-inversions in hydrostatic atmospheres .",
    "the inversions are , however , not an artifact of this assumption but can also be present in dynamical atmospheres .",
    "the inversions are not removed unless a very high mass loss rate is present , and is neither necessarily removed by convection if the large radiative forces occur close to the surface .",
    "thus , super - eddington luminosities does _ not _ automatically initiate a stellar wind . the location of the h - deficient rcrb stars in the immediate proximity of the computed opacity - modified eddington limit ( fig .",
    "[ f : eddlimit ] ) , is certainly suggestive of a connection between the enigmatic visual declines of the stars and the eddington limit .",
    "it is therefore proposed that instabilities as the rcrb stars encounter the eddington limit during their evolution towards higher @xmath9 are the unknown trigger mechanism for their famous variability .",
    "the eddington limit may thus be the `` smoking gun '' for the declines : gas is ejected due to the high radiative forces in the atmospheres , which then cools rapidly first radiatively and later from adiabatic expansion to reach sub - equilibrium temperatures and thus possibly enable dust condensation ( cf .",
    "woitke et al .",
    "1996 for the similar case of shocks instead induced by pulsations ) .",
    "such gas ejections may be observable as absorption components in strong lines , as observed by rao & lambert ( 1997 ) in rcrb at maximum light .",
    "if a connection indeed exists , it could explain why the ehe and hdc stars do not show rcrb - like variability as a result of being located on the stable side of the eddington limit .",
    "it also points to an interesting similarity between the rcrb stars and the lbvs .",
    "thus , the two types of stars known to be situated at the eddington limit both show eruptive behaviour , which suggests a similar underlying physical explanation for their variability .",
    "a search for radiative and dynamical instabilities in the atmospheres has been carried out for both h - rich and h - deficient late - type supergiants , but only partly successfully .",
    "sound waves are found to be amplified by the large radiative forces but the linear stability analysis reveal only rather slow growth rates compared to for early - type stars despite the super - eddington luminosities .",
    "such radiation - modified sound waves may thus be partly responsible for the semi - regular pulsational variations of such supergiants , but it is doubtful whether the instability is efficient enough to eject gas clouds from the atmospheres as speculated above .",
    "the atmospheres are also found to be close to dynamically unstable , which might give rise to increased mass loss , as previously suggested for lbvs ( stothers & chin 1993 ) and for the termination of the agb phase ( e.g. paczyski & zikowski 1968 ; wagenhuber & weiss 1994 ) .",
    "this does not , however , explain in what way the rcrb stars are special compared to other similar stars . in fact , the h - rich models seem to be more vulnerable to such instabilities , which suggests that dynamical instabilities are not the answer to the declines of the rcrb stars .",
    "another possibility is of course that the same dynamical instabilities occur in both types of stars but that the h - deficient and c - rich environment of the rcrb stars greatly favours dust condensation , and thus the observational manifestation , compared to for h - rich compositions .",
    "one can also imagine that the eddington limit is still responsible for the behaviour of the rcrb stars though in a more indirect way .",
    "( 1997a , b ) has shown that the effect of rotation coupled with strong radiative forces may lead to increased mass loss in the equatorial plane , and it is possible that such a mechanism is at work in these supergiants , despite the presumably relatively small rotational velocities .",
    "the difference in observed variability between the rcrb stars and the hdc and ehe stars could then be the result of viewing angle .",
    "there are some observational evidence for such bipolarity ( e.g. rao & lambert 1993 ; clayton et al .",
    "1997 ) violent instabilities due to strange mode pulsations leading to dramatically increased mass loss is another possibility , which is partly related to the eddington limit , since both have their origin in ionization zones , as do the dynamical instabilities discussed above . whether any of these instabilities , or a combination thereof , could help explain the variability of the rcrb stars and the lbvs certainly deserves further investigation .",
    "finally , it should be remembered that the stability analyses presented here assume the unperturbed model to be a realistic description of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "at least for the rcrb stars , there are strong indications that this is in fact not the case ( gustafsson & asplund 1996 ; asplund et al .",
    "1997a , b , c ; lambert et al .",
    "1997 ) . if the supergiant atmospheres are indeed distinctly different from the predictions of standard models , the efficiency of radiative instabilities may have been underestimated .",
    "one can suspect that models based on the normal assumptions , such as the mixing length theory for convection , near the eddington limit may be very unsuitable .",
    "clearly , radiative hydrodynamical simulations of such atmospheres would be valuable , also since they would shed further light on possible instabilities .",
