    "one may think that the repeated starbursting of a dwarf galaxy quickly exhausts the gas reservoir , thereby making the whole picture inconsistent .",
    "however , the low surface brightness galaxies like the qbcds are gas - rich @xcite , with fuel to power the star formation during several hubble times .",

    "the scenario of a recursive starbursting is not in conflict with the commonly accepted view of a sfr decreasing during the last 10 gy @xcite .",

    "the metallicities of our qbcd  galaxies are systematically larger than the metallicities of the bcd  galaxies .",
    "this result seems to be in conflict with the recursive bcd phase scenario , since the bcd starburst starts off with a metallicity lower than the metallicity of its host galaxy ( see table[properties ] ) .",
    "although this disagreement may indicate a real flaw in the overall picture , one can also think of various ways to circumvent the apparent inconsistency .",
    "for example , the bcd episodes may involve fresh low metallicity gas accreted by the host galaxy during the periods of quiescence .",

    "masses of @xmath143 are also typical of the high velocity clouds hounding our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if these gas reservoirs are common in qbcds , they may develop major star formation events when merging with the galaxy .",

    "it is relatively easy to enrich with metals the small fraction of galactic gas undergoing starbursts .",
    "for example , the metallicity of a pure gas cloud increases from the level observed in bcds ( @xmath145 ; table  [ properties ] ) to the level in qbcds ( @xmath146 ) , if 60% of the original mass is transformed into starts.0.003 ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . ]",

    "we note that this explanation may be in conflict with the ir excess detected in the halos of blue  compact  galaxies by @xcite .",

    "the colors can not be explained with a normal metal - poor stellar population like the milky way halo , but an excess of low - mass stars with significant metallicity is required ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of the disagreement requires further investigation , and it may be due to the fact that these blue compact galaxies with ir excesses are not dwarfs according to the criteria used in our work .",
    "there is yet another possibility to reconcile the metallicities of the two galaxy types . only those qbcd  candidates with metallicity similar to that of the bcd  galaxies would be part of the bcd   qbcd  sequence .",
    "the qbcds with metallicity like the bcds represent 20% of the sample ( see fig .",

    "the same happens with the h  i consumption timescale worked out in equation  ( [ comp9 ] ) .",
    "these qbcd  galaxies may keep their low metallicity levels because the metals are expelled by galactic winds ( @xcite ; see , however , @xcite ) , because they are recycled into new stellar generations within superstar clusters , without significant mixing with the galactic gas @xcite , or simply because of the dilution with pristine gas described above .",
    "we select isolated qbcd  galaxies , therefore , the starburst triggering mechanism to turn them into bcds can not be galaxy - galaxy interactions , mergers or harassment .",
    "how , then , are the bcd  bursts triggered ?",
    "several possibilities are available .",
    "if the fresh gas falls on the qbcd  galaxy over extended periods of time , intense star formation can not be triggered until the gas density exceeds the required threshold ( the so - called schmidt law ; @xcite ) .",
    "waiting for enough gas to accumulate could explain periods of latency .",
    "if the gas falls in during short episodes ( like the collision with a large gas cloud ) , the hitting of the gas itself may induce star formation .",
    "then the qbcd  timescale would be given by the characteristic time between cloud collisions .",
    "if rather than coming from outside , the fresh gas is part of the galaxy , internal galactic structures like bars may periodically excite star formation . in the case of a gas - rich galaxy the triggering may also be due to perturbations of the galactic material by dark matter clumps .",
    "these elusive structures are predicted in lots by the cold dark matter simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they are expected to disturb the quiet evolution of galactic disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the criteria used to characterize qbcds come from the bcd  host galaxies analyzed by @xcite , but we may have used different criteria taken from other works .",
    "the question arises as to whether the selection of candidates critically depends on this assumption .",
    "the bcd  host galaxy properties are used to constrain colors and sersic indexes ( see   [ lsbstuff ] and table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "the lower limit luminosity , also taken from the bcd  host galaxies , turns out to be unimportant since the small number low luminosity objects prevents any serious influence of this criterion on the selection ( see fig .",
    "[ mybcd ] ) .",
    "the range of visible @xmath119 colors that we use agrees with the colors that different studies have assigned to the hosts of bcds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this sense the color criterion does not seem to be questionable and , therefore , any work would have rendered similar qbcd  candidates .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and if we search for galaxies that may be blue - compact-_dwarf _ galaxies during quiescence , they must be dwarfs too ( see equation  [ [ law ] ] . )",

    "the technique is well suited for determining the time elapsed from the last ( young ) starburst , and it has been calibrated by @xcite . depending on the noise level , one can apply the method to selected qbcd  sdss spectra , or to averages of similar qbcd  spectra .",
    "another testable prediction of the scenario has to do with the metallicity inferred from emission lines in qbcd  galaxies (   [ metallicity ] ) .",
    "it should overestimates the true galaxy metallicity and , in particular , the metallicity of the stellar content .",
    "studies of stellar metallicity can be carried out using integrated galaxy spectra , provided that they have enough signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution to show absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
