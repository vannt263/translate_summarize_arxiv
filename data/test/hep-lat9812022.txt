    "discretized models of @xmath2dimensional euclidean quantum gravity , known as simplicial gravity or dynamical triangulations , have been extensively studied in the past decade .",
    "the two dimensional model was proposed quite some time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , and generalized to three and four dimensions in ref .",
    "the model is defined by the grand - canonical partition function @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the discrete cosmological and inverse newton s constants , @xmath7 is the number of @xmath2dimensional simplices , and @xmath8 is the canonical partition function @xmath9 the micro - canonical partition function , @xmath10 , is defined as @xmath11 where the sum is over an ensemble of combinatorial triangulations @xmath12 with a spherical topology and with @xmath13 vertices and @xmath7 @xmath2simplices . for @xmath14",
    "these two numbers are independent .",
    "the symmetry factor @xmath15 of a triangulation @xmath16 is given by the number of equivalent labeling of the vertices .",
    "including this factor is equivalent to summing over all _ labeled _ triangulations @xmath17 .    as a statistical system simplicial gravity displays a wealth of intriguing features .",
    "in @xmath14 it exhibits a geometric phase transition separating a strong - coupling _ crumpled _ phase , where the internal geometry of the triangulations collapses , from a weak - coupling _ elongated _ phase characterized by triangulations consisting of `` bubbles '' glued together into a tree - like structure or branched polymers @xcite .",
    "both in three @xcite and four dimensions @xcite this transition is discontinuous .    in the absence of a continuous phase transition with a divergent correlation length any sensible continuum limit where a theory of gravity might be defined appears to be ruled out",
    "this has led to the studies of modified models of simplicial gravity , e.g.  by changing the relative weight of the triangulations with a modified measure @xcite , or by coupling matter fields to the theory @xcite .",
    "suitable modified the phase structure of the model changes ; the polymerization of the geometry in the weak - coupling limit  the elongated phase  is suppressed and a new _ crinkled _ phase appears @xcite . the crinkled phase is separated from the other two phases by lines of either a soft continuous phase transitions , or possible a cross - over ( a divergent specific heat is not observed ) .",
    "qualitatively the same phase structure , shown schematically in figure  1 , is observed both in three and four dimensions .",
    "both in the elongated and in the crinkled phase the canonical partition function is seen to have the asymptotic behavior @xmath18 which defines the string susceptibility exponent @xmath19 . in the crumpled phase , on the other hand ,",
    "the sub - leading behavior is exponential , corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "many of the properties of the model eq .",
    "( [ part.grand ] ) , in the weak - coupling regime @xmath21 , are reflected by triangulations close to the upper kinematic bound @xmath22 .",
    "this is evident both from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and from the analysis of a strong - coupling expansion ( sce ) of the partition function . for combinatorial triangulations , where each simplex is uniquely defined by a set of @xmath23 distinct vertices ,",
    "the upper kinematic bound is @xmath24 .",
    "although this bound is only saturated in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath25 , for each finite volume there exist triangulations with a well - defined maximal number of vertexes @xmath26 .",
    "the ensemble of these triangulations , the _ maximal _ ensemble @xmath27 , defines the micro - canonical partition function @xmath28    in this paper we investigate the properties of the maximal ensemble , mostly restricted to three dimensions , using both mc simulations and a sce , i.e.  a direct enumeration of the micro - canonical partition function eq .",
    "( [ part.max ] ) .",
    "this investigation is separated into two parts . in the first part we study the pure ( un - modified ) ensemble and",
    "show that @xmath29 effectively separates into _ three _ distinct series ( or two series in @xmath30 ) as in general there are several different volumes @xmath7 corresponding to a given @xmath31 .",
    "one of those series is an ensemble of _ stacked spheres _ , a particular simple class of triangulations which can be enumerated exactly .",
    "this we do in section  3 .",
    "the other two series can be considered as `` almost '' stacked spheres , i.e.  with one , or two , _ defects _ respectively .",
    "heuristic arguments , supported by numerical evidence , show that although the leading asymptotic behavior of the three series is identical , the effect of inserting a defect increases the exponent @xmath19 by @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) compared to stacked spheres .",
    "this is discussed in section  4 .    in the second part of the paper ,",
    "section  5 , we study the model eq .",

    "as the measure is modified , varying @xmath37 , we observe a soft geometric phase transition from the elongated phase to a crinkled phase for @xmath38 , in agreement with the phase diagram figure  1 .",
    "moreover , a scaling analysis of the transition is consistent with a third order transition ( @xmath39 ) .    in the crinkled phase the fractal structure",
    "is dominated by a gas of sub - singular vertices , i.e.  vertices whose order grows sub - linearly with the volume .",
    "the intrinsic fractal structure is characterized by a set of critical exponents : ( i ) a negative string susceptibility exponent @xmath19 , which decreases with @xmath37 .",

    "it follows that in general more then one volume will correspond to a given maximal vertex number . in @xmath50",
    "this defines three different _ series _ , labeled by the @xmath51pairs : @xmath52 the first series @xmath53 has the smallest volume for a given number of vertices and we will call it the _ minimal _ series .",
    "likewise , in @xmath30 there are in principle four different series . however , as only combinatorial four - triangulations of _ even _ volume are allowed this reduces to only two : @xmath54    in the space of all triangulations , the different series are related through a set of ( topology preserving ) geometric changes , the @xmath55moves . in a @xmath55move , where @xmath56 , a ( @xmath57)sub - simplex is replaced by its  dual  ( @xmath58)sub - simplex ,",
    "provided no manifold constraint is violated .",

    "the different series are connected , for fixed @xmath13 , by the @xmath62 and the @xmath64moves . however , as it is not possible to apply move @xmath64 to the series @xmath53 ( as triangulations in this series have the minimal volume for a given @xmath13 ) , the only connection which the maximal ensemble has with the rest of the triangulation space is _ via _ move @xmath62 applied to the series @xmath65 .",

    "there exist triangulations , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , that can not be reduced to the minimal configuration of the corresponding series by a repeated application of the move @xmath78 .",

    "as stacked spheres have a simple tree - like structure , it is possible to calculate the partition function restricted to this ensemble explicitly . in this section",

    "it is interesting to note that although the series of unlabeled triangulations has the same asymptotic behavior as the labeled one , i.e.  the same @xmath106 and @xmath19 , the sub - leading corrections are not analytic in this case .",

    "compared to a method of directly identifying distinct triangulations in mc simulations , discussed in next section , using the algorithm presented above it is possible to calculate more terms in the sce .",
    "however , method presented above is limited to the enumeration of stacked spheres , i.e.  to a sub - class of the maximal ensemble , and moreover the series has to be calculated separately for each value of @xmath37 .",

    "( [ def.gamma ] ) .    to investigate the asymptotic behavior , and to verify the statement above , we have performed several numerical experiments . in figure  [ fig.free ] we show the micro - canonical partition function for the three series measured numerically for @xmath125 .",
