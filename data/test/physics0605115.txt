    "a number of studies have shown that different financial markets reveal hierarchical structure   that can be approximated by factor and group models ( e.g.  @xcite for the stock market case ) . at the level of financial data ,",
    "these structures are determined principally by strength of correlations in returns of different stocks , currencies or other assets .",
    "the most popular methods of such an analysis are based on the calculation of correlation matrices from multivariate time series of returns .",
    "the correlation matrices can then be diagonalized in order to obtain spectra of their eigenvalues and eigenvectors  @xcite or can serve as a source for the construction of minimal spanning trees  @xcite . in the standard approach , in which the correlations between all analysed assets are taken into consideration ,",
    "the correlation matrix is by construction symmetric due to the correlation coefficient invariance under a swap of signals .",
    "this obviously leads to a real eigenspectrum of the matrix .",
    "usually properties of the empirical correlation matrix are compared with universal predictions of the adequate , wishart ensemble of random matrices and the identified deviations are considered as an indication of actual correlations among data .    in principle , however , there is no restriction imposed on the symmetry property of a correlation matrix : it may well be antisymmetric or even completely asymmetric , depending on which signals are used in the calculations .",
    "for example , if there are two separate sets of signals and the correlations are calculated only across these two sets , the resulting matrix can no longer be symmetric and , consequently , its eigenspectrum can be complex .",
    "however , there is still a non - zero probability that some of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are real .",
    "as long as a distribution of the correlation matrix elements is close to a gaussian , the most relevant random matrix ensemble , against which the results should be tested , is the ginibre orthogonal ensemble ( ginoe )  @xcite . for the financial data characterized by fat tails of p.d.f .",
    "this assumption can also be made provided the time series under study are sufficiently long .    at present",
    "one observes in literature a growing interest in theoretical research on properties of real asymmetric and , more generally , non - hermitean random matrices .",
    "this interest is motivated by a broadening spectrum of applications of such matrices which includes , among others , random networks  @xcite , quantum chaos  @xcite , quantum chromodynamics  @xcite and brain research  @xcite .",
    "an issue which we address in this work and which can serve as an example of application of the asymmetric correlation matrices to empirical data can be related to a globalization of financial markets .",
    "we investigate the cross - market correlations between returns of stocks traded on two large but geographically distant markets : new york stock exchange and deutsche brse .",
    "our objective is to identify the strength of the instanteous as well as the time lagged dependencies between evolution of these two markets .",
    "we begin with presenting a brief construction scheme of an asymmetric correlation matrix and a short description of basic properties of ginoe .",
    "let us consider the two disjoint sets @xmath0 each consisting of @xmath1 assets and denote by @xmath2 and @xmath3 the time series of normalized logarithmic returns of assets @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "for each set we construct an @xmath7 data matrix @xmath8 and the correlation matrix @xmath9 according to formula @xmath10 each matrix element @xmath11 is the pearson cross - correlation coefficient for assets @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . in the next step",
    "the correlation matrix can be diagonalized by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath15 which provides us with a complete spectrum of generally complex eigenvalues @xmath16 and pairs of conjugated eigenvectors @xmath17 .",
    "the assumption @xmath18 in eq.([corrmatx ] ) leads to the standard definition of a symmetric correlation matrix @xmath19 with a real eigenspectrum .",
    "properties of the empirical correlation matrix have to be tested against a null hypothesis of completely random correlations characteristic for independent signals . random matrix theory ( rmt )",
    "offers some analytic results for a corresponding ensemble of real asymmetric matrices , i.e. the ginibre orthogonal enseble  @xcite defined by the gaussian probability density @xmath20 , \\label{pdfginoe}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 stands for @xmath22 real matrix . in the limit of @xmath23",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of a ginoe matrix is homogeneous and assumes a regular elliptic shape in the complex plane  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 parametrizes a degree of matrix symmetry ( @xmath27 correspond to , respectively , symmetric matrix with all eigenvalues being real and antisymmetric matrix with imaginary eigenvalues , while @xmath28 means full asymmetry ) . in physical situations with finite @xmath1 ,",
    "these spectra , however , loose their homegenity due to excess of real eigenvalues @xmath29 whose expected number expressed as a fraction of @xmath1 in the @xmath23 limit reads  @xcite @xmath30 a typical eigenvalue p.d.f . in the complex plane of a random matrix ( @xmath31 ) obtained from 100000 independent matrix realizations is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "6.5 cm 6.95 cm",
    "our example of an application of the asymmetric correlation matrix is based on high frequency data from nyse and deutsche brse  @xcite spanning the interval 1 dec 1997 @xmath32 31 dec 1999 .",
    "we analyze @xmath33 stocks belonging to the dow jones industrials group and the same number of stocks constituting the main german dax30 index .",
    "we calculate each element of @xmath34 by cross - correlating the time series pairs representing all possible combinations of an american and a german stock .",
    "we neither consider the correlations inside the german market nor inside the american one . in order to investigate temporal dependencies between both markets",
    "we introduce a time lag @xmath35 and associate it with the german stocks , i.e. we look at @xmath2 and @xmath36 , where @xmath35 can assume both positive and negative integer values .",
    "thus , @xmath37 denotes a retardation of all the signals corresponding to german stocks while @xmath38 denotes the opposite case .",
    "6.5 cm 6.5 cm    since the two markets under study are separated by a few time zones , their activities overlap only for a relatively short period of a trading day ( only the days that were common to both markets are considered ) . for most time it was only 90 minutes a day from 9:30 to 11:00 new york time ( 15:30 to 17:00 frankfurt time ) and only after changing the trading hours in the german floor starting from 20 sep 1999",
    "the overlap interval increased to 120 minutes ( from 9:30 to 11:30 in new york and 15:30 to 17:30 in frankfurt ) .",
    "this means that actually we can analyze the time series spanning 47700 minutes total .",
    "a good time resolution should be a crucial aspect of our analysis hence we consider only short time scales of returns : from @xmath39 seconds down to @xmath40 seconds .",
    "shorter time scales can not be used due to a fact that transaction times in the taq database are stored with only 1 s resolution .",
    "6.5 cm 6.5 cm    6.5 cm 6.5 cm    first of all let us look at the correlation matrix and its eigenvalues for @xmath41 ( no time lag , synchronous evolution of both markets ) .",
    "figure 2(a ) presents p.d.f . of the matrix elements @xmath42 for @xmath40 s ( histogram ) together with a fitted gaussian distribution ( red solid line ) . except the central part of the empirical distribution , where there are excessive small positive elements and lacking small negative ones , the gaussian is well approximated by the histogram ( the same refers to the other time scales ) .",
    "thus , the correlation matrix can be treated  @xcite as a sum of an essentially random core matrix and a non - random part carrying the actual inter - market correlations .",
    "this suggests that we can expect the eigenvalue spectrum consisting of an rmt bulk and at least one significant non - random eigenvalue responsible for the correlations .",
    "in fact , exactly this type of spectrum can be seen in figure 2(b ) .",
    "all except one eigenvalues are localized inside the rmt prediction for a completely asymmetric matrix and the remaining largest one is distant and resides on the real axis . by an analogy to a symmetric matrix",
    "we are justified to associate this eigenvalue with the coupling strength of the two markets ( the global market factor ) .",
    "interestingly , there is no other factor which can influence the behaviour of some smaller parts of the markets like e.g. specific economic sectors .",
    "figure 3 shows examples of the eigenspectra for two different positive time lags .",
    "as we increase @xmath35 from 0 s up to 5 min , we observe a gradual decrease of @xmath43 which remains real even for @xmath44 s , but eventually looses its identity by drowning in the sea of random eigenvalues for @xmath45 min . from the market perspective , after such a time interval the stocks traded in frankfurt forget about what happened earlier in new york .",
    "we however still can not say anything decisive about the possible directional information flow between the markets .",
    "it requires a more systematic investigation in which the largest eigenvalue @xmath46 ( i.e. the one with the largest absolute magnitude ) becomes a function of variable @xmath35 .",
    "figure 4 displays @xmath47 for different time scales of the returns .",
    "it can be seen that with the resolutions of @xmath39 and 60 s the maximum coupling between the markets occurs for synchronous signals and the non - random correlations exist for @xmath48 minutes . for @xmath49",
    "s a weak trace of asymmetry in both the maximum position and the memory length can be identified , which is confirmed in the plot for @xmath50 s. going down to the shortest time scale of 3 s , this asymmetry becomes clear .",
    "figure 5 documents that the stocks from both markets are maximally correlated if the american market is retarded by about 3 - 15 seconds in respect to its german counterpart .",
    "this observation is somehow counterintuitive because one might expect that the american stock market , being the largest in the world and representing the world s largest economy , is less dependent on external influence than is the german market",
    ". we can not give a straightforward explanation of this phenomenon , though .",
    "its source can lie in memory properties of the american market as well as in some specific behaviour of investors in the beginning of a trading day in new york .",
    "for example , they may carefully observe the evolution of the european markets which in the years 1998 - 99 used to finish their activity rather soon after the american markets had been opened .",
    "we also can not exclude the possibility that the reason for this is a possible existence of artifacts in the trade recordings in taq or kkmdb databases which can not be identified in data .",
    "finally , the observed asymmetry of the curve tails in figures 4 and 5 with respect to @xmath41 can be explained , at least in part , by different autocorrelation properties of the two markets under study .",
    "this is evident in figure 6 , where the largest eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix @xmath19 is calculated separately for the german and for the american markets .",
    "here @xmath35 assumes only non - negative values due to a symmetry of the problem ; @xmath47 is a multivariate counterpart of the autocorrelation function .",
    "it is clear from figure 6 that the german market has considerably longer and stronger memory than its american counterpart ; in fact , this memory can lead to longer - lasting cross - dependencies presented in figures 4 and 5 if the german market is retarded .",
    "on the other hand , investors in frankfurt may need a longer time to collect all the information needed before they make investment decisions if they take more markets and more information into consideration .",
    "it is also possible that the american stock market is technically more advanced and , on average , allows the investors to react quicker than in germany .",
    "we construct an asymmetric real correlation matrix from time series of returns representing two separate groups of stocks : german and american ones .",
    "nonexistence of a symmetry condition allows us to concentrate solely on the inter - market correlations without mixing them with the correlations that are inner to only one market , and to study temporal properties of such correlations .",
    "we introduce a time lag associated with german stocks and investigate traces of direct information transfer from one market to the other which can manifest itself in the existence of significant non - synchronous couplings between the markets represented by a @xmath35-shifted maximum in the largest eigenvalue of the empirical correlation matrix .",
    "we identified such delayed correlations indicating that the same information is shared by both markets with the american one following its german counterpart only after a few seconds .",
    "this observation , however , can not be treated as a fully convincing one due to a significant broadening of the @xmath47 maximum and an unintuitive direction of this transfer from a smaller towards a larger market .",
    "another conclusion from our results is that the coupling between the two analyzed markets is only of a one - factor type .",
    "we do not noticed other , more subtle partial couplings that can involve a subset of stocks .",
    "our results can be compared with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in which an analysis of the delayed correlations between different stocks traded on the american market are studied by means of the correlation coefficients .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a similar analysis can also be performed by applying the asymmetric correlation matrices used in our work .",
