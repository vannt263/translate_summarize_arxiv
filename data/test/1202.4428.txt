    "two - dimensionally extended materials , or membranes , have been paid much attention to in various fields of study , such as lipid bilayers @xcite and surfactants @xcite in soft - matter and biophysics @xcite . alongside , many theoretical studies on those membrane - type objects have been done toward a general understanding of physical properties of such materials @xcite . some of them were simulation approaches @xcite and others were with field theoretical techniques @xcite .",
    "for example , one of the authors studied the pore formation in a binary giant vesicle of two - component lipid bilayer , and reproduced its dynamical shapes in the field - theoretical approach with some numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "although most of the works contributed successfully to our knowledge of individual membranes , it can be said that we are yet very far from the general understanding .    in this work ,",
    "we aim to give some new insight to the general understanding of the physical properties of soft - material membranes by studying mathematical models on discretized surfaces both analytically and numerically .",
    "that is to say , we propose a family of fluid particle models of two - dimensional lattice as simpler models of membranes : tightly pack molecular particles on a given lattice , and give the particles dynamics by some stochastic process , or by a set of mathematical rules . for more simplicity , we consider single - component , single - layered incompressible systems , and assume no explicit viscosity and an upper bound for the flow velocities on the particles .",
    "after the formulation , we construct two stochastic models of 2d lattice liquid , as our first steps .",
    "one of them is found to be the vicious random walk @xcite in its densest phase and a version of the dynamic lattice liquid model ( dll model ) @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "the dynamics of these models is given by completely independent time steps and would not generate various fluid dynamical phenomena such as lasting convective flows , while our formulation does not exclude such possibilities .",
    "in fact , the other model is constructed as the flow model with a mathematical rule , which has no corresponding known models .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to a finite flat honey - comb lattice and simulate the two models with their highest mobility . comparing with similar lattice models such as various lattice random walks or the loop gas model ( sos model ) @xcite , we show some statistical properties of the models by the simulation results .",
    "the results tell that the flow model may exhibit some anomalous diffusion , in terms of time - averaged mean square displacements ( tamsd ) , and the ergodicity with its fairly long relaxation time .",
    "relations to other models and some possible extensions of the models will also be discussed in the final section .",
    "there are various situations of the membrane systems , and each situation would deserve a single mathematical model in order to simulate it .",
    "however , since we aim to construct a basic model to be utilised for those various situations , we focus exclusively on a very simple but basic situation among them as a building block .",
    "first , we focus on a single - component and single - layered molecular system on a two - dimensional surface , treating the surrounding medium as a kind of heat bath to the surface . in other words , we introduce some rules or external forces onto the elements of the membrane rather than consider the interactions between the membrane and the medium . secondly , we focus exclusively on a simple classical interaction such as `` collision '' , neglecting any other complicated interaction between the elements of the membrane .",
    "let us call this ` no explicit viscosity ' .",
    "thirdly , we assume that the density fluctuation can be negligible and two elements would not occupy the same location of the surface at any time .",
    "this would correspond to the incompressibility condition of the surface from the two - dimensional fluid point of view . to summarise , we assume and focus on a single - component and single - layered incompressible particle systems with no explicit viscosity on a two - dimensional surface exposed in an external ( random ) field .",
    "now , we are ready to define the 2d lattice liquid models . given a two - dimensional lattice @xmath0 , a 2d lattice liquid model can be defined as a mathematical model of the particles which can only reside at the sites of the lattice @xmath0 , covering all or almost all of the sites , and which flow inside @xmath0 as molecular - dynamical units of liquid do inside them . here",
    ", the particles represent the elements of the membrane , and are assumed to be of the same physical properties : their sizes , masses , and so on .",
    "the word ` liquid ' comes directly from two parts of the above definition , one of which is that the particles cover all or almost all of the sites of @xmath0 , and the other of which is that the particles flow .",
    "obviously , there is an ambiguity on the phrase `` all or almost all '' . to avoid this ambiguity in this paper",
    ", we force each site to hold only and exactly one particle at a time , covering _ all _ the sites .",
    "we call it `` the occupation number is exactly one everywhere '' .",
    "although we can make some of the sites empty or put as many particles as possible , the assumption of the density fluctuation eliminates the latter and we simply omit the former in this paper .",
    "note that the definition of the lattice liquid would not exclude these cases and would be worth studying elsewhere .",
    "one can consider the boundary conditions in the presence of boundary of the surface .",
    "there are two types of boundary conditions , one of which is on particles dynamical degrees of freedom , and the other of which is on their internal degrees of freedom , such as particle species . the former type of boundary conditions are naturally embedded in the lattice on which we define the model . on the latter , since we only consider single - component systems , there is no boundary condition on the particle species .    to complete the definition of the model , the particles `` flows ''",
    "should be defined by imposing a set of mathematical rules on the flows .",
    "this consequently determines the dynamics of the system . before going into the details of the rules ,",
    "let us introduce the lattice conventions and consider the configuration space of the model to begin .",
    "a lattice @xmath0 is defined by a set of sites @xmath1 and a set of bonds @xmath2 .",
    "a bond @xmath3 is connecting a pair of the sites , @xmath4 , which are called neighbouring sites or in the neighbourhood .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath5  the shortest length of the bonds specifies a fine aspect of the lattice .",
    "we consider only the cases with the same bond length , unless otherwise stated .",
    "for that reason we set @xmath6 without loss of generality .",
    "the total number of the sites and the total number of the bonds are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we abbreviate them by @xmath9 and @xmath10 for simplicity .",
    "the degree of the site , @xmath11 , is the number of the bonds connected to the site @xmath12 .",
    "if there is only one value for @xmath11 on @xmath0 , we write it by @xmath13 for short , and we consider mainly such cases . in the later sections of some numerical calculations , we focus on the honeycomb lattices of various sizes as a series of examples .    on a given lattice @xmath0 , under any set of the rules of the movements , a flow of a particle can be sketched schematically in fig.[fig : worldlines ] below .        introducing the minimum time lapse @xmath14 , a particle at the site @xmath12 at the time @xmath15 flew from the site @xmath16 at @xmath17 with the velocity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is implicitly taken as a unit ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "then , the particle at @xmath12 at @xmath15 flows toward @xmath21 at the future time @xmath22 , subject to some fluctuation @xmath23 by external forces . explicitly writing the time dependence of the variables",
    ", @xmath24 denotes the flow velocity of the particle from @xmath17 to @xmath15 , and @xmath25 does from @xmath15 to @xmath22 .",
    "we denote the latter velocity by a redundant variable @xmath26 for convenience .",
    "the solid continuous line in fig.[fig : worldlines ] represents the particle travelling in @xmath27-dimensional space - time , and all the particle movements can be represented by such world - lines .",
    "namely , the configuration of the system at a certain time @xmath15 , can be uniquely given by a set of the flow velocities : \\{_i(t ) }  for  all   i v ( ) .",
    "accordingly , the time evolution is realised by mapping a configuration @xmath28 to another configuration @xmath29 at a successive time , while a particle at @xmath12 travels to @xmath30 with the velocity @xmath31 such that : i^= i+^_i(t ) , _",
    "i^(t+t ) = ^_i(t ) . for consistency",
    ", @xmath18 and @xmath32 can not take completely arbitrary values , but are subject to the constraint that @xmath33 and @xmath34 map @xmath35 to itself and they are bijective . in other words ,",
    "the configuration space is given by the whole set of such bijections .",
    "such a space is highly complicated in general , however one assumption actually makes the space more tractable .",
    "we assume the following upper bound for the velocities : |_i| 1  for  all  i v ( ) .",
    "this means that the particles are prevented from jumping in between non - nearest neighbouring sites .",
    "therefore , the assumption is not too restrictive in the physics context . when the bond lengths are all the same , this leads the absolute value @xmath36 takes either @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly , the velocity @xmath18 takes one of @xmath39 values . since @xmath40 obeys the same , the velocity change @xmath41 takes at most one of @xmath39 values as well .    with the upper bound of the velocities and the assumption of the occupation number",
    ", a configuration of the particles can be represented by a collection of oriented non - intersecting loops on @xmath0 . in order to illustrate this fact ,",
    "let us give a set of random velocities , @xmath42 , with the condition @xmath43 .",
    "all particles potentially try to move toward the directions they have been kicked by some external forces . however , this does not necessarily give movements to the particles due to the frustration of such momenta ( fig.[fig : frustration - circ](a ) ) .",
    "the frustration is an outcome of the excluded volume effect of the particles together with the restriction of the occupation number . in order to generate convective flows ,",
    "some part of the `` potential '' movements generated by the forces must be enclosed so that the particles can move ( fig.[fig : frustration - circ](b ) ) .",
    "+ ( a )     + ( b )    hence , the relevant part of the configuration @xmath33 can be represented by a collection of _ oriented _ non - intersecting loop graphs on @xmath0 .",
    "we label the space of the oriented non - intersecting loop configurations by @xmath44 .",
    "we also label the loop configuration without the orientations by @xmath45 for later use .",
    "formal definition of the ( oriented ) loop configurations in graph theory , refer to appendix [ ap : loops ] .",
    "note that , if and only if @xmath46 , the above algorithm coincides with a version of the dll model @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we focus on the situations where the loop configuration solely plays a crucial role .",
    "as was stated before , the set of mathematical rules of the particle - flows give the principal part of the definition of the model .",
    "however , regardless of how and what sort of the rules are imposed , they are to be expressed in the form of the velocities and the velocity changes : @xmath33 and @xmath47 , or in the form of the present loop configuration and the resulting one , @xmath48 , representing the velocities .",
    "so , we formulate the 2d lattice liquid models as a family of statistical models defined with such variables .",
    "one of the most straightforward expressions of the propagator would take the form of : [ eq:1stprop ] & & g ( x_1 , x_2 , ; g , t ; g^ , t^ ) & & or   g ( x_1 , x_2 , ; \\{_i(t ) } , t ; \\ { _ j(t^ ) } , t^ ) , or as its ensemble : [ eq:2ndprop ] & & z^g ( x_1 , x_2 , ; g , t ; t^ ) & & _ g^ ( ) g ( x_1 , x_2 , ; g , t ; g^ , t^ ) , where the @xmath49 s are other unspecified parameters to prescribe the propagator .",
    "if all the processes are statistical from the beginning , @xmath50 , even the initial configuration is given by some distribution , the following quantity would be the partition function in question : & & z(x_1 , x_2 , ; t , t^ ) & & _ g ( ) p_init ( g ) z^g ( x_1 , x_2 , ; g , t ; t^ ) , where the function @xmath51 is the statistical weight of the configuration @xmath52 .",
    "practically , we will focus on the second expression ( [ eq:2ndprop ] ) of the propagator and the first one ( [ eq:1stprop ] ) for the construction of the second .",
    "let us construct a more concrete yet abstract form of the propagator by the probabilities of the configurations .",
    "for the time step of @xmath19 , given the present configuration @xmath53 , let us define @xmath54 as the `` potential '' probability of a particle remaining at the site @xmath12 , and @xmath55 is the `` potential '' probability of the particle at @xmath12 being kicked toward one of the nearest neighbouring sites @xmath56 .",
    "they satisfy : [ eq : px - const ] p(i)+_j x(i;j ) = 1 , where the summation is over all nearest neighbouring sites to @xmath12 . in general , @xmath54 and @xmath55 may carry the information from the past , but we ignore it in the rest of this manuscript . recall that some of the kicks with the `` potential '' probabilities might not be performed due to the before mentioned frustration .",
    "suppose non - frustrated part of the particles are expressed in the configuration @xmath57 .",
    "the complementary graph can be given with its projection @xmath58 on @xmath45 by @xmath59 .",
    "then , the probability of having @xmath57 in @xmath0 , @xmath60 , can be given by the product of the loop probability @xmath61 of having @xmath57 in @xmath58 and the probability @xmath62 of the frustration in @xmath63 as follows : p(g^ ) = p_l(g^ ) p_f(|g^ ) , where the initial configuration @xmath53 is implicit , and the loop probability can be expressed by multiplying the probabilities @xmath55 s along the oriented loops : p_l(g^ ) _ _ i , j e(g^ ) x(i;j ) . note that the definitions of the above probabilities need some minor extensions to the subgraphs for their consistency .",
    "for the detailed definition of the probability functions and their properties , refer to appendix [ ap : pfpl ] .",
    "the probability @xmath60 is nothing but the first expression ( [ eq:1stprop ] ) of the propagator for one time step .",
    "accordingly , the second expression ( [ eq:2ndprop ] ) of the propagator for one time step is : z^g(g , t ; t+t ) & = & _ g^ ( ) p ( g^ ) .",
    "specifying its @xmath53 dependence by @xmath64 , the propagator for a longer time span can be expressed by : & & z^g(g^(0 ) , t ; t^ ) & & = _",
    "g^(1 ) ( ) _ g^(k-1 ) ( ) _ k=1^k p(g^(k ) ; g^(k-1 ) ) , where @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the construction of the propagator reduces to a detailed construction of the probability functions , @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "note that the above expression actually corresponds to the discretised version of the path integral .",
    "given the probabilities , an expectation value of some physical quantity @xmath66 for @xmath19 can be given as usual by the form of : _ g & = & _ g^ ( ) o p(g^ ; g ) .",
    "it is obvious that the set of the mathematical rules of the particle - flows give the principal part of the definition of the 2d lattice liquid model as well as of its formulation .",
    "in fact , one can easily imagine the following three sorts of the rules for the particle - flows .",
    "namely , the particles flow according to some stochastic process , or subject to some external thermodynamic forces from the surrounding medium , or obeying some physics laws with their ( fluid ) dynamical properties such as the langevin - type equation or the navier - stokes equation in the low @xmath67 single - component limit . in order to avoid ambiguities on discretisation and limiting procedures in the equation - based approaches , we deal only with the stochastic cases here . some relations to thermodynamic or equation - based approaches",
    "will be discussed later .      in this section ,",
    "we construct and formulate one of the simplest stochastic models , the stochastic markovian model , whose rules are as simple as assigning simple kicks to push the particles and arresting them at the end of each step .",
    "the model is turned out to be equivalent to the vicious random walk in its densest phase and a version of the dll model on two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the precise definition of the rules are given as follows .",
    "first , let @xmath54 be non - negative constant , and @xmath55 be of isotropic kicks such that : [ eq : bounds4p ] p(i ) & = & p , x(i;j ) & = & x(i ) . here , we restrict them to be strictly independent of the past , ensuring that the process is markovian .",
    "second , we assign the kicks according to the above probabilities , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and those kicks are projected onto some oriented loop configuration @xmath53 .",
    "perform the moves of @xmath53 .",
    "thirdly , as a key part of the rules , we force : [ def : sto ] _",
    "j(t+t ) = _ i(t ) i , where @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the configuration of the velocities is set at every step by the fluctuation @xmath71 only .",
    "accordingly , one of the two sets , @xmath33 and @xmath72 , becomes redundant .",
    "note that @xmath73 inherits the upper bound from @xmath36 : @xmath74 .",
    "practically , it follows @xmath75 .",
    "the probability of an oriented loop configuration @xmath53 on the sublattice @xmath76 can be written by : p_l ( g ) = _ _ i , je(g ) x(i ) .",
    "if @xmath11 s are all the same as of regular lattices , the above probability can be simplified as : p_l ( g ; x ) = x^l(g ) , where we specify @xmath77 as an argument , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 denotes @xmath80 for @xmath81 of @xmath53 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the total length of the loops in @xmath53 . note that @xmath77 plays the role of the fugacity of the bonds in @xmath53 .",
    "if we further define the probability of a non - oriented loop configuration @xmath76 on the sublattice @xmath76 , summing up all the orientations of @xmath76 , it follows that : p_l ( g ; x ) = 2^(g ) x^l(g ) , where @xmath82 by definition , @xmath83 counts the number of the loops in @xmath76 , and the factor ` 2 ' indicates the directions of each oriented loop in @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , the propagator , or the partition function , can be written down by : [ eq : part_sto ] g^sto ( x ) = _ g ( ) p_l(g;x ) p_f ( |g ; x ) , which is equivalent to unity by definition .",
    "@xmath84 gives the probability of the no - loop configuration .",
    "the probabilities @xmath62 and @xmath61 take physical values , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that if @xmath88 is set to be one for any @xmath76 then the partition function reduces to that of the non - oriented non - intersecting loop configurations on a lattice , which is known as the loop gas model @xcite : @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "so , @xmath88 plays a crucial role in our model .    as in the definition ( [ def : sto ] ) , the present configuration is always trivial so that the above expression ( [ eq : part_sto ] ) is exact at any @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the propagator can be expressed by : z^sto(x ; t ; t+t ) = g^sto(x ) .",
    "hence , it can be summarised and simplified to the propagator of the time lapse @xmath15 as follows :",
    "z^sto(x ; t ) = ^t / t .",
    "the expectation value of a physical quantity @xmath66 is given in a conventional manner : _ t & = & ^t / t , & = & _ g ( ) op_f ( |g ; x ) p_l(g;x ) . before giving our simulation results , let us show some simple relations and calculations on an isotropic regular lattice .",
    "on an isotropic regular lattice , such as a square lattice with periodicities , the one - point function of the velocity can trivially be given by : = 0 , by symmetry .",
    "similarly , the expectation value of the absolute value of the velocity at @xmath12 can be given by : = = i , where @xmath91 is the expectation value of the length of the loops : @xmath92 .",
    "besides , the variance of the velocity becomes : = = , where the normalised lattice spacing is used .    with the above facts",
    ", one can state that each particle behaves like a random walker on the given lattice with the constant trapping ratio of @xmath93 , where a particle moves to a certain direction with the probability @xmath94 .",
    "namely , for any @xmath95 for large @xmath0 or small @xmath15 : & = & 0 , & = & t , where @xmath96 denotes the position of the @xmath97-th particle at the time @xmath15 . however , it should be noted that the system is not a collection of independent simple random walks , as our particles do not occupy the same site at the same time .",
    "in fact , the system is in the densest phase of the vicious random walks  mutually avoiding @xmath98 particles random walks on a lattice with @xmath98 sites @xcite .",
    "the difference between this system and a collection of the independent simple random walks can be clearly shown by the spacial correlation of the velocities .",
    "for example , the spacial correlation of a nearest pair of the system is given by : , whereas those of the simple random walks is given by a simple product of one - point functions : @xmath99 .",
    "in the previous sections , we have formulated the model where the streamlines are temporally generated and live only for the duration of @xmath19 .",
    "because the probability of the shortest loop in a honeycomb lattice is at most @xmath100 in the bulk , @xmath91 seems to be very small .",
    "we infer in the model ( i ) that the stochastic process realises the solid - like nature of the membrane rather than its liquid nature as the dll model targeted supercooled liquids . in this section",
    ", we intend to explore another class of stochastic models where the particles keep flowing on the membrane rather than obeying the ` stop and go ' evolution . in order to realise this phenomenon",
    ", we take the simplest way : if no fluctuations are added to the system , the particles keep flowing along the oriented loops",
    ". this rule can be expressed by the relation in the absence of the fluctuations : [ def : stof ] _",
    "i(t+t ) = _ i(t ) . now",
    ", it is evident that the key point of the construction lies on how to add stochastically generated fluctuations onto the existing streamlines .    in order to avoid complications for realising the relation ( [ def : stof ] ) and the frustrations in terms of @xmath47 ,",
    "let us formulate the above addition in terms of the oriented loop configurations .",
    "say , @xmath101 is the initial configuration and @xmath102 is the resulting configuration .",
    "the arithmetic rule ( addition / subtraction ) for the oriented loop configurations can be illustrated in a multiplicative form by : g g_i = g_f ( ) , where @xmath103 stands for the stochastically generated fluctuations , and vanishing @xmath103 is given by the no - loop configuration @xmath104 naturally satisfying the rule ( [ def : stof ] ) . in @xmath45 , there is a natural definition of such an additive operation as the symmetric difference .",
    "we extend and modify it to our case for @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath106 , @xmath107 be elements in @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath107 consists of the same sites and bonds with opposite directions as those of @xmath106 , then we call @xmath107 the inverse of @xmath106 , denoting it by @xmath108 .",
    "the additive operation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 is defined in the multiplicative form by : g_1 g_2 = g , such that the directed bonds of the elements satisfy : [ eq : symdiff - directed ] g & = & g_1 g_2 - g_1 g_2 ^ -1 - g_1 ^ -1 g_2 , while the disconnected sites are removed from @xmath53 .",
    "the above addition trivially satisfies the followings : g_1 i ( ) & = & i ( ) g_1 = g_1 g_1 ( ) , g_1 g_2 & = & i ( ) g_2 = g_1 ^ -1 , where @xmath104 behaves as the zero in the addition and the identity in its multiplicative form .",
    "the problem of this definition is that @xmath53 is in the corresponding ( directed ) cycle space but not necessarily in @xmath44 . to avoid this unwanted situation , we propose the following projected addition for @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : symdiff - directed ] ) : [ def : addition ] g_1 g_2 & = & g g ( ) , g_1 g_2 & = & g_2 g ( ) . in the second line , we call @xmath106 is non - additive to @xmath107 , or vice versa",
    ". this projection drastically changes the algebraic nature of the operation . in fact",
    ", it breaks the commutativity : @xmath109 , and the associativity : @xmath110 .",
    "so , the ordering of the operations matters in this case .",
    "it should be mentioned here that we can create some different definitions of the addition simply by different projections of @xmath111 onto @xmath44 . as a starting point",
    ", we stick to the above definition and will mention another possibility later .",
    "note also that , precisely speaking , @xmath103 is either a candidate for a fluctuation or a fluctuation which sometimes does nothing , because of the projection .",
    "if the configuration at the time @xmath95 is given by @xmath112 , the configuration @xmath113 at the time @xmath114 can be expressed by a series of successive additions of @xmath103 to @xmath112 : g(t_0+t ) = g(t_0 ) .",
    "[ def : flow - part ] the multiplication in the r.h.s . means the multiple application of the loop additions , @xmath115 , and the addition should be done from right to left .",
    "the factor expresses nothing but a configurational and kinetic path between two configurations .",
    "finally , we complete the definition of the stochastic flow model by stochastically giving @xmath103 in the same manner as in the previous section .",
    "namely , assign the `` potential '' probabilities of a particle remaining at the same position and of a particle at @xmath12 being kicked toward one of the nearest site @xmath56 by @xmath68 and @xmath55 , respectively . for the isotropic distribution",
    ", @xmath55 can be simplified to @xmath116 .",
    "then , project the velocity changes onto the space of the oriented loop configurations @xmath44 , and add it to the current configuration in the end .",
    "the degrees of freedom of @xmath41 and @xmath18 are same as @xmath39 , as long as an additional upper bound for @xmath41 is not imposed .",
    "so , their spaces differ only by the meanings of @xmath68 and @xmath55 . for simplicity , we neglect this difference and distribute the probabilities isotropically .",
    "note that the addition rule implicitly introduced the upper bound for @xmath23 such that @xmath117 .",
    "now , we have formulated how the fluctuations are given and added to existing flows .",
    "the propagator with the initial configuration @xmath118 can now be written down by : & & z^flow(x ; g_i , t_0 ; t+t_0 ) & & = _",

    "some have smaller degrees from those in the bulk . in the case of the honeycomb lattice , there are degree - two boundary sites .",

    "their orders of magnitude are roughly the same we set for the initial time @xmath156 for tamsds .",
    "it can be said that the system is generally in an anomalous diffusion process where @xmath157 in the short range , and @xmath155 in the distance .",
    "there can be found a strange and interesting plateau as well in the middle of the curve for each size of the lattice , but we have not yet obtained any clear explanation of the plateau .",
    "we will further mention this in the final section .",
    "there is a closest model to compare with our model ( ii ) , which is the non - reversal random walk . in that model ,",
    "a random walker can bring a little memory for its past path so that it will not come back to the memorised positions .",
    "usually , the walker memorises only the previous position in order not to come back at once .",
    "the model is sometimes known as a polymer chain model with excluded volume . in our flow model , a particle movement",
    "is always associated with a ring of movements and can not reverse immediately .",
    "this minimum regulation matches with that of the non - reversal walker .",
    "in addition , because the non - reversal walker is not bounded by any loop - like relation to neighbours , we deduce that it gives the upper limit for the tamsd of our model .",
    "we define the stochastic flow model ( ii ) and the non - reversal random walk on the lattice @xmath158 , and compare them in terms of their tamsds in fig.[fig : comparisonii_21 ] .",
    "notice that the constant trapping ratio is equipped with the non - reversal walkers to keep the pace of his first step with the flows in our model .    .",

    "we have calculated the asymptotic value of the msd with some assumption as follows .",
    "assume that , in the limit of @xmath159 , the time correlation of every particle on @xmath0 vanishes so that a particle situated at any of the sites on @xmath0 at a certain time @xmath95 is to be drifted to every site with equal footing in the infinite future .",
    "then , the asymptotic value of @xmath160 can simply be given by the average of the square distances of all the relevant pairs of the sites on @xmath0 .",
    "on the rectangular honeycomb lattice @xmath121 , we derived its exact formula and the leading terms are given by : [ eq : asymptotic_approx ] _",

    "see appendix [ app : aymptotic ] for the exact form of an arbitrary @xmath98 .",
    "the time - averaged msds in fig.[fig : msd11 - 41 ] , [ fig : comparisonii_21 ] approach the calculated asymptotic values ( [ eq : asymptotic ] ) and are stabilised around them as the time grows .",
    "therefore , we can state that our models are surely ergodic in this sense .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed and formulated a family of models , called the 2d lattice liquid models , as one sort of the simplest models of single - component , single - layered , incompressible fluid particle system on a membrane without explicit viscosity and density fluctuation .",
    "the model is formulated as a particle system on a lattice , but the configurations are found to be expressed by the sets of oriented non - intersecting loops , due to the restriction on the occupation number and the upper bound for the velocities . following the formulation ,",
    "we have constructed two models of the lattice liquid .",
    "one of them is the stochastic markovian model ( i ) which is found to be another manifestation of the vicious random walks in its densest phase and the dll model in two dimensions .",
    "we have dealt with the model on the isotropic lattice , and derived a few basic quantities of the model .",
    "we have also shown that the difference between our model and a collection of non - interacting simple random walks by distinct two - point functions .",
    "the other model is the stochastic flow model ( ii ) where the set of rules are given in eqs.([def : stof ] , [ eq : symdiff - directed ] , [ def : addition ] ) .",
    "the first rule ( [ def : stof ] ) is on the stability of the existing flow and is written in the euler formulation .",
    "we have utilised the notion of the oriented loop configurations @xmath44 and formulated the model . in order to interpret the fluctuation as a direct consequence of the kicks by the environment",
    ", it is worth rewriting the rule in the original lagrangian formulation . in this paper , we have focused on the construction of the model itself , and neglected this point .    in numerical calculations",
    ", we have realised both models on the rectangular honeycomb lattice @xmath121 of various sizes in one million time steps . from the input data of the models on @xmath121",
    ", we have found that the probability of the no - loop configuration , @xmath132 , has a scaling relation with the area of the lattice , and we have proposed the functional form ( [ eq : pfapprox ] ) for a general size of the honeycomb lattice as an approximation .",
    "we briefly report here that the probability of one - loop length - six configurations and that of length - ten can also be explained by the proposed form of @xmath62 .",
    "this might suggest that the form of @xmath62 with other additional criteria can explain how the distribution of the total length of the loops takes such a peculiar form in fig.[fig : looplen_dist ] .",
    "the area laws of the average loop length @xmath91 and the average loop number @xmath141 are also to be explained .",
    "we do not know the answers yet . in the numerical calculations of the flow model ( ii )",
    ", we have shown the probability of how many fluctuations of @xmath162 had been added in a million trials . as @xmath98 goes over @xmath163 , the system seems to be stuck against the projected addition .",
    "this reduction of the fluctuations is entirely due to the definition of the projected addition . because of the second line of the projection rule ( [ def : addition ] )",
    ", if @xmath164 is huge enough as a set , many elements of @xmath44 become non - additive .",
    "even so , practically speaking in quasi - critical states , there are about 30% vacant faces .",
    "therefore , the system can not be entirely frozen , changing only the time scale for its dynamics .",
    "it is the msd on which the time scale matters . especially , the emergence of the plateaus in fig.[fig : msd11 - 41 ] might be because of this strong restriction of the fluctuations .",
    "we then expect that softening the projection in the addition may change the intermediate plateau part of the msds , and this point is to be explored more elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are many related statistical models .",
    "particularly , the vicious walk and the dll model are the closest ones to the model ( i ) .",
    "the vicious walk is the model of mutually avoiding multiple particle system so that its densest phase inevitably coincides with ours with the simplest stochastic process .",
    "the dll model is the model of cooperative particle rearrangement for supercooled liquids and polymer melts , usually equipped with volume fluctuations and their temperature dependence . in both cases , the dynamics is governed by completely independent time steps , and they surely overlap with this sort of the models among the family of our models . especially in the dll model , the dynamics is usually equipped with the temperature dependence of @xmath69 , so it would be intriguing to investigate another manifestation of the temperature dependence and multi - component systems @xcite in both contexts .",
    "in addition , the loop gas model is one of the closest models . letting all @xmath62 be one ,",
    "one automatically obtains the partition function of the loop gas model from that of our stochastic markovian model of the lattice liquid .",
    "the loop gas model can be described in the @xmath165 spin model on the lattice by expressing all the loop graphs in terms of @xmath165 spin variables @xcite .",
    "to avoid complications , we have not included this algebraic description of our models .",
    "also , in the presence of the @xmath62 less than unity , the loop probabilities of both models become different .",
    "we can quantify them by the use of number series known as the derangement number and its related series . to invoke the expression ,",
    "the models must be first written in the form of algebras .",
    "we have put aside this procedure , and therefore , to be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we are afraid that the constructed models are not so applicable and not ready to be compared to experiments , except for a few cases in a very different context .",
    "because we used the honeycomb lattice as an explicit example , the current model might be able to be applied directly to a particle system of the same situation : a bigger sort of particles form a most densely packed crystal sitting at the centres of the faces while smaller particles moving in between them .",
    "because of the set - up , the msd of the flow model actually resembles that of the super - cooled polymer melt @xcite .",
    "since their dimensions are different , we consider this happens by accident though .    in order to apply 2d lattice liquid models to soft - material membranes directly",
    ", one should remove or relax some of the assumptions we used in this paper for convenience .",
    "namely , the assumptions are such that the system must be single - component , single - layered , incompressible , non - explicitly - viscous , less density fluctuating . also , we have not used interactions between particles . note that they are not the requirements nor the definitions of the 2d lattice liquid models . among them",
    ", double - layer can easily be embedded just by folding a layer into two , but the interactions between two layers are not obvious . the simplest one is to introduce the interaction between layers only at the common boundary of two layers , possibly as a boundary condition .",
    "our construction itself is ready to be extended to the multi - component case where there are more than one particle species and the interaction between different species should be introduced as well .",
    "the simplest one will be the ising - type nearest neighbour interaction with which one can observe the phase separation according to some temperature .",
    "this might also turn on the effective viscosity in the model . note the concept of the temperature",
    "can naturally be installed by letting @xmath166 be a function of @xmath67 , for example , by @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "thermodynamic behaviour will depend on the manifestation of the functional forms of @xmath77 and @xmath68 .",
    "some of the above proposals will be studied elsewhere @xcite    another very interesting yet possibly very hard model to solve is the fluid model with memory effect . as we mentioned in the manuscript , the `` potential '' probabilities can potentially carry the information from the past so that the past partially control the forthcoming event through the probabilities . here , we have only dealt with markov processes in both models , and the problem is beyond our scope of this manuscript .    *",

    "replacing @xmath227 by @xmath228 , one can rewrite this as @xmath229 : [ c3 ] r_q,(k , l)^2 & = & 34 k^2 + 94 l^2 + 18 c(q , l ) - 8 c(q , l ) ( -1)^k+l , where @xmath230 from this expression , one can verify that @xmath231 is integer .",
    "assume that , in the limit of @xmath159 , all the pairs of the sites are independent to each other so that the asymptotic value of @xmath209 can simply be given by the average of the square distances of all the relevant pairs in @xmath232 combinations .",
    "namely , the value leads to the expression : [ eq : r_inf ] [ eq : r^2 ] & & _ t & & = _ relevant . here",
    ", the word `` relevant '' means that some sites at the boundary can not contribute to the above , because our flow dynamics can only involve those points which have more than one bond .",
    "for instance , regardless of the value of @xmath98 , the following two sites should always be excluded : q = \\ { ( 0,0 ) , ( 2n,0 ) } .",
    "besides , when @xmath98 is odd , the following two sites are to be taken into account in the same manner : q = \\ { ( 0,n ) , ( 2n , n ) } .",
    "they are connected only one nearest neighbouring site , so that the particle can not reach these four points via our flow dynamics .",
    "therefore , the square distances related to these points do not contribute to the above calculation . substituting ( [ c3 ] ) into ( [ eq : r^2 ] ) and subtracting such unnecessary terms from the sum",
    ", we obtain for odd @xmath98 : & & & & = & & & & 18 ( 7 n^2 + 10 n ) , up to @xmath233 . in the cases of @xmath234 ,",
    "the exact values are given in the manuscript up to first five digits .",
