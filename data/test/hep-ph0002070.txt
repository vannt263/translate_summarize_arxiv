    "the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) neutrinoless conversion of a bound 1s - muon to electron in the field of a nucleus @xcite-@xcite @xmath10 is known as one of the best probes to search for the hypothetical muon and electron flavor non - conservation @xcite .",
    "so far , the experiments @xcite-@xcite seeking for @xmath11 conversion events have only succeeded to put upper bounds on the branching ratio @xmath12 i.e. the ratio of the muon - electron conversion rate relative to the total rate of the ordinary muon capture .",
    "the best upper limits have been extracted at psi by the sindrum ii experiments in the values ( at 90% confidence level ) @xmath13 @xmath14 these limits are improvements over the previous limits set at triumf @xcite a decade ago using the same targets .    at present ,",
    "two @xmath1 conversion experiments are launched , the ongoing experiment at psi using @xmath3ti target @xcite , and the planned meco experiment at brookhaven @xcite using @xmath5al target .",
    "the expected sensitivity on @xmath2 in the psi experiment is @xmath15 while in the brookhaven experiment it will be roughly @xmath16 which implies an improvement over the existing limits by about four orders of magnitude .",
    "the meco experiment is going to be conducted in a new @xmath17 beam line at the ags , where the muons are produced using a pulsed proton beam @xcite .",
    "the proton energy will be chosen in the range of 8 - 20 gev to optimize the @xmath18 flux per unit time .",
    "furthermore , the number of electrons with energy @xmath19 mev , equal to the energy for the coherent peak in @xmath5al , is very much suppressed .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of @xmath20 , where the electron flux from @xmath21 decay is peaked at the energy of the electrons from @xmath22 .    for such experiments the knowledge of nuclear transition matrix elements for all accessible @xmath23 channels of the targets employed are of significant importance @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this work we use the transition matrix elements calculated for the aforementioned isotopes in the coherent mode to constrain the lepton flavor violating parameters of various lagrangians predicting this exotic process ( e.g.  scalar and vector couplings , neutrino mixing angles and masses @xcite-@xcite , supersymmetric r - parity violating couplings @xcite-@xcite etc . ) . to this aim the recent experimental data and the expected sensitivity of the meco experiment .",
    "as is well known , only the coherent rate can be measured because it is free from background events from bound muon decay and radiative muon capture followed by a fully asymmetric @xmath24 pair creation @xcite . on the other hand , previous studies of @xmath1 conversion rates @xcite-@xcite",
    "have shown that for all mechanisms the coherent mode dominates the process ( [ reaction ] ) which means that this is the most important channel .",
    "the incoherent reaction leading to excited nuclear states is suppressed due to pauli blocking effects and it is much harder to calculate but its knowledge is also useful in order to determine the experimentally interesting quantity of the ratio of the coherent to the total @xmath6 rate ( see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the family quantum numbers @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are conserved within the standard model ( sm ) in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "however this is an accidental consequence of the sm field content and gauge invariance .",
    "physics beyond the sm can easily spoil this property .",
    "processes like @xmath11 conversion , which is forbidden in the standard model by muon and electron quantum number conservation , play an important role in the study of flavor changing neutral currents and possible physics beyond the sm .    on the particle physics side @xcite , there are many mechanisms of the @xmath11 conversion constructed in the literature ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these mechanisms fall into two different categories : photonic and non - photonic .",
    "mechanisms from different classes significantly differ from the point of view of the nucleon and nuclear structure calculations .",
    "this stems from the fact that they proceed at different distances and , therefore , involve different details of the structure .",
    "the long - distance photonic mechanisms are mediated by the photon exchange between the quark and the @xmath11-lepton currents .",
    "these mechanisms resort to the lepton - flavor non - diagonal electromagnetic vertex which is presumably induced by the non - standard model physics at the loop - level .",
    "the @xmath11 lepton - flavor violating loop can appear as the @xmath28 loop [ fig.1(a ) ] with the massive neutrinos @xmath29 and the loop with the supersymmetric particles such as the neutralino(chargino)-slepton(sneutrino ) [ fig.1(d ) ] . in the r - parity violating susy models",
    "there are also lepton - slepton and quark - squark loops generated by the superpotential couplings @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the short - distance non - photonic mechanisms contain heavy particles in intermediate states and can be realized at tree level [ fig.2 ] , at 1-loop - level [ fig.1(a , b , d , e ) ] or at the level of box diagrams [ fig.1(c ) ] .",
    "the tree - level diagrams can be constructed in the r - parity violating susy models with the virtual z - boson , squarks @xmath32 and sneutrinos @xmath33 [ fig.2 ] .",
    "the 1-loop diagrams of the non - photonic mechanisms include the diagrams similar to those for the photonic mechanisms but with the z - boson instead of the photon [ fig.1(a , d ) ] as well as additional z - boson couplings to the neutrinos and neutralinos [ fig.1(b , e ) ] .",
    "the box diagrams are constructed of the w - bosons and massive neutrinos [ fig.1(c ) ] as well as similar boxes with neutralinos and sleptons or charginos and sneutrinos .",
    "our purpose is to calculate the contribution of the above - described mechanisms to the @xmath6 conversion branching ratio ( [ def1 ] ) . at the first step we construct the effective @xmath6 conversion hamiltonian for these mechanisms in terms of nucleon degrees of freedom of a nucleus involved in the process",
    "this will allow us to accomplish the calculation of @xmath2 by applying the conventional nuclear structure methods using non - relativistic impulse approximation .",

    "one of the most interesting quantities in @xmath6 conversion , both from theoretical and experimental points of view , is the branching ratio @xmath2 defined in eq .",
    "( [ def1 ] ) . the expression which gives @xmath2 in the case of the dominant coherent channel has been written as @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is nearly independent of nuclear physics  @xcite and contains the flavor - violating parameters mentioned before .",

    "for ground state to ground state transitions ( @xmath86 ) in spherically symmetric nuclei the following integral representation is valid @xmath87 where @xmath88 the zero order spherical bessel function and @xmath89 the proton ( p ) , neutron ( n ) nuclear density normalized to the atomic number @xmath90 and neutron number @xmath35 of the participating nucleus , respectively .",
    "the space dependent part of the muon wave function @xmath91 , a spherically symmetric function , can be obtained by solving numerically the schrdinger and dirac equations with the coulomb potential .    for the coherent rate in light nuclei the factorization approximation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is very good and @xmath92 can be expressed in terms of the nuclear form factors @xmath93 ( for protons ) and @xmath94 ( for neutrons ) which are easily estimated ( for this channel only the ground state wave function of the studied nucleus is required ) .",

    "they have been calculated using proton densities @xmath117 from the electron scattering data @xcite and neutron densities @xmath118 from the analysis of pionic atom data @xcite .",

    "the results do not significantly differ from those of the schrdinger picture .    in table 1",
    "we also show the muon binding energy @xmath121 ( obtained as output of the dirac and schrdinger solution ) and the experimental values for the total rate of the ordinary muon capture @xmath122 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    using values for @xmath115 and @xmath116 for a set of nuclei throughout the periodic table @xcite",

    "( [ phi ] ) and its approximate expression @xmath123 of eq .",
    "( [ phitil ] ) .",
    "we see that @xmath102 is very small ( @xmath124 ) and , because the terms of the quantity @xmath125 depending on @xmath102 are also small , we conclude that the nuclear dependence of @xmath125 can be ignored as we have discussed in sect .",
    "2 .    since there is at maximum @xmath126 difference between @xmath102 and @xmath123 and because the isovector terms of the quantity @xmath125 are small , especially for light nuclear systems , one can also use @xmath127 in the expression ( a , z ) dependence of @xmath125 .",
    "the results of table 1 can be exploited for setting constraints on the parameters of a specific gauge model predicting the @xmath11 process . in table 3",

    "( [ rme - ti ] ) , ( [ rme - pb ] ) and the expected experimental sensitivity of the brookhaven experiment , @xmath128 [ see eq .",
    "( [ rme - al ] ) ] .",
    "the limits of @xmath73 and @xmath101 quoted in table 3 are improvements by about four orders of magnitude over the previous ones .",
    "we should stress that the limits on the quantities @xmath73 of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and @xmath101 of eqs .",
    "( [ rme.1 ] ) , are the only constraints imposed by the @xmath11 conversion on its underlying elementary particle physics .",
    "one can extract upper limits on the individual lepton flavor violation parameters ( couplings of scalar , vector currents , neutrino masses etc .",
    "@xcite ) under certain assumptions like the commonly assumed dominance of only one component of the @xmath11 conversion lagrangian which is equivalent to constrain one parameter or product of the parameters at a time . for example , in the case of susy mechanisms , in order to learn about the size and the regularities of possible violation of r - parity , one needs some information on the parameters @xmath129 and the sneutrino vacuum expectation values @xmath130 @xcite . using the upper limits for @xmath101 given in table 3 we can derive under the above assumptions the constraints on @xmath131 of eq . ( [ rme.1 ] ) and the products of various parameters .",
    "thus , the bounds obtained for the scalar current couplings @xmath132 in the @xmath133-parity violating lagrangian for the @xmath5al target @xcite are @xmath134 .",
    "the limit for @xmath132 obtained with the data of ti target @xcite is @xmath135 , i.e. more than two orders of magnitude weaker than the limit of @xmath5al .    with these limits it is straightforward to derive constraints on the parameters of the initial lfv lagrangian . in table 4",
    "we list the most stringent constraints on the products of the trilinear couplings which we obtained from the experimental limit on @xmath11 conversion in @xmath136 [ see eq . ( [ rme - ti ] ) ] and from the expected experimental sensitivity of meco detector using @xmath5al as a target material [ see eq .",

    "the @xmath11-conversion limits on the products @xmath141 are significantly more stringent than those previously known in the literature @xcite and given in the 2nd column . in refs . @xcite it was shown that except few cases , the constraints on @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 obtained from @xmath11 conversion data are better than those derived from any other process .",
    "as we have mentioned at the beginning , significantly better improvement on these limits is expected from the ongoing experiments at psi @xcite and even better from the meco experiment at brookhaven @xcite .",
    "this would make the @xmath11 conversion constraints better than those from the other processes in all the cases .    before closing",
    "we should note that the last four limits for @xmath145 in table 4 originate from the contribution of the strange nucleon sea .",
    "these limits are comparable to the other @xmath11 constraints derived from the valence quarks contributions .",
    "the transition matrix elements of the flavor violating @xmath6 conversion are of notable importance in computing accurately the corresponding rates for each accessible channel of this exotic process .",
    "such calculations provide useful nuclear - physics inputs for the expected new data from the psi and meco experiments to put more severe bounds on the muon - number - changing parameters ( isoscalar couplings , etc . ) determining the effective currents in various models that predict the exotic @xmath6 process .",
    "in the case of the r - parity violating interactions discussed here we have studied all the possible tree - level contributions to the @xmath11 conversion in nuclei taking into account the nucleon and nuclear structure effects .",
    "we found new important contribution to @xmath146 originating from the strange quark sea in the nucleon which is comparable with the usual contribution of the valence @xmath147 quarks .    from the existing data on @xmath2 in @xmath136 and @xmath137 and the expected sensitivity of the designed meco experiment",
    "@xcite we obtained stringent upper limits on the quantities @xmath73 and @xmath125 introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and ( [ rme.1 ] ) .",
    "they can be considered as theoretical sensitivities of a particular experiment to the @xmath6 conversion signals for various targets employed .",
    "thus , these quantities are helpful for comparing different @xmath11 conversion experiments",
    ". we also extracted the upper limits on the products of the trilinear parameters of the type @xmath141 which are significantly more severe than those existing in the literature .",
    "as to the other products , the following observation was formulated in refs .",
    "@xcite . if the ongoing experiments at psi @xcite and brookhaven @xcite will have reached the quoted sensitivities in the branching ratio @xmath2 then the @xmath11 constraints on all the products of the parameters @xmath148 , @xmath145 , @xmath149 measurable in @xmath11 conversion will become more stringent than those from any other processes .",
