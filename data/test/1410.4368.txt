    "modern theory of spiral structure has begun 50 years ago with works by @xcite , but it is still not completed .",
    "one possible approach here is to find unstable eigenoscillations , or _ unstable modes _ , of the stellar disc arising due to self - gravity .",
    "unstable modes are characterized by their shape and complex frequency @xmath0 , in which the real part determines the pattern speed of the spiral , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of arms , while the imaginary part gives the exponential growth rate of the amplitude , @xmath3 ( i.e. the growth rate of instability ) .",
    "if an unstable mode exists , a spiral pattern is formed spontaneously due to the growth of small fluctuations in the initially axisymmetric equilibrium distribution of the stars and the gravitational potential .",
    "generally , there can be several unstable modes , and then the form of the spiral pattern is determined by the most unstable mode or a superposition of several modes in the case of close growth rates .",
    "the knowledge of the spectrum of unstable modes , i.e. their location in the ( @xmath4)-plane , is obviously important for understanding the formation of the stellar disc and finding the shape of the spiral pattern .",
    "this approach may be invaluable not only for the problem of spiral structure formation , but also for the reconstruction of spiral patterns , when direct observations can not be performed .",
    "such a situation occurs in our own galaxy .    in an alternative approach",
    ", the formation of spiral patterns is explained by the interplay of continuously arising , evolving , and fading transient spirals @xcite . unlike modes , which are waves with constant shape and frequency ( @xmath4 )",
    ", they have a fast evolving form and frequency .",
    "the superposition of transient spirals can also lead to a quasi - stationary global picture .",
    "both approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive . depending on the shape of the rotation curve @xmath5 and the phase space distribution function ( df ) ,",
    "one or the other alternative can be realized .",
    "moreover , they can coexist in one model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , if the disc has a large - scale unstable mode , then it should dominate and determine the shape of the global spiral pattern .",
    "this paper considers available methods for finding disc unstable modes . for the first time , this problem was solved by @xcite . in linear perturbation theory , i.e. when the amplitude of oscillations is small compared to the corresponding unperturbed quantity , form and ( complex ) frequency of the mode are fixed .",
    "these characteristics can be formally obtained by the solution of a non - linear matrix equation . in practice , however , this kalnajs matrix equation is effective only when a suitable set of potential ",
    "density basis functions is available .",
    "moreover , due to the non - linearity of the equation a priori knowledge of the approximate values of the desired frequency is needed .",
    "the linear matrix equation of the form @xmath6 for unstable modes without using potential ",
    "density basis functions was suggested by @xcite . the advantage of his method is to obtain the entire spectrum immediately without a priori information on the localization of modes .",
    "however , the weak side of polyachenko s method is the need to work with high - order matrices @xmath7 .",
    "the question of the accuracy of the spectra and the individual modes is addressed in detail in section 3 .",
    "further efforts were directed to reduce the order of the matrix @xmath7 . using the petrov - galerkin projection for the collisionless boltzmann equation ,",
    "@xcite proposed a method of the form ( [ lap ] ) , based on the introduction of a small number of ` interpolating ' functions in action sub - space and the expansion of the potential and surface density in a biorthogonal set of functions .",
    "the choice of the basis functions is limited to several sets @xcite . in his next work",
    "@xcite used the bubnov ",
    "galerkin weighting , where the expansion in a biorthogonal basis was replaced by a finite element method ( fem ) , which approximates the potential and the surface density in annular elements .",
    "this method is well established in structural engineering , as well as in various fields of physics .",
    "unstable solutions of kinetic equations can be of different nature .",
    "for example , the most unstable mode can occur due to a sharp jump of the df at the disc edge , but be localized in the very centre .",
    "hardly this mode can determine the shape of a global spiral pattern .",
    "therefore , one needs to find all unstable modes , i.e.  the entire spectrum .",
    "most of the available calculations of unstable modes are carried out for models with a smoothly rising rotation curve , so - called soft - centred models .",
    "such models are characterized by low mass concentration to the centre , which account for the finite values of the angular velocity @xmath8 and epicyclic frequency @xmath9 in the centre , as well as the existence of a limiting value of the pattern speed when the spiral has no inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , @xmath10 .",
    "ilrs are crucial to the possibility of spiral and bar formation in the disc centre @xcite and thus for the shape of the spectrum of unstable modes . for soft - centred models ,",
    "the modes form a wake pattern resembling one from a small boat bifurcating at @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in models with high mass concentration ,",
    "e.g.  with a flat circular velocity profile @xmath5 or the profile based on observational data , the calculation of spectra is more complicated .",
    "the results are sensitive to uncertainties of model parameters derived from observations , and to parameters of the methods ( computational meshes , etc . ) .",
    "another problem relates to the interpretation of multiple ` spurious ' modes with small growth rates .    the aim of this work is to compare the methods by @xcite by calculating spectra of unstable bisymmetric ( @xmath12 ) modes for several models of stellar discs with both smoothly rising and flat @xmath5 . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review of the linear matrix methods .",
    "section 3 presents the models , spectra , and patterns , as well as discusses the applicability of the methods and the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the concluding section summarizes the results and outlines some perspectives .",
    "in the linear approximation , we consider small perturbations of a system in equilibrium .",
    "let the stars move in the plane of symmetry of the axially symmetric gravitational potential @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 depends only on the action variables @xmath15 , which are integrals of motion .",
    "the equations of motion can be easily integrated , and the corresponding angle variables @xmath16 are @xmath17 where @xmath18 are some phases , and @xmath19 are the radial and azimuthal frequencies . in general both active ( stellar disc ) and passive ( bulge , halo , etc . ) components contribute to the potential @xmath20 .",
    "the circular velocity is determined by the total unperturbed potential @xmath21    the unperturbed stellar disc is described by the equilibrium df @xmath22 depending on the integrals of motion .",

    "the flat circular velocity profile @xmath5 of the mestel disc fits better to describe galactic rotation curves , but brings difficulties in the centre of the disc , where the frequencies @xmath94 grow indefinitely and therefore the ilr occurs for any value of @xmath95 .",
    "the third model is our first attempt to study the spectral properties of galactic disc models with realistic rotation curves .",

    "the first profile rises steeply in the centre , and gives high angular velocity @xmath239 ( see fig.[fig6](b ) ) . in this respect ,",
    "the first model is similar to toomre ",
    "zang model discussed above .",
    "in contrast , the two - component model has a much smoother rise in the centre , and hence moderate oscillation frequencies of stars .    here , we restrict ourselves to the study of the two - component model .",

    "a comparison of the spectra obtained by the different methods is given in fig.[fig6](c ) .",
    "the pme and ecb spectrum resembles the spectrum of the exponential model , and consist of two well - defined groups of unstable modes .",
    "the first group departs from the bifurcation point @xmath253km",
    "/ s / kpc , which corresponds to the maximum value of the angular velocity .",
    "the second group departs from @xmath254km / s / kpc , corresponding to the maximum of the curve @xmath255 .",

    "note that here we obtained no unstable modes with ilr .",
    "the most unstable mode has a frequency @xmath256 km / s / kpc , corresponding to an e - folding time of the growth rate of @xmath257myr .",
    "contrary to pme and ecb , the fem methods with interpolating functions ( [ j10phi ] ) completely fail for this model : the outcome consisted of neutral modes only .",
    "the reason was in vanishing of the denominator in equation ( [ j10phi ] ) for orbits within @xmath258kpc . due to the harmonic potential in this region",
    "arbitrary orbits satisfy resonance conditions for purely radial orbits , @xmath259 .",
    "investigation of @xmath260 , for which the resonance structure of orbits is different , confirms this conjecture : femf gives @xmath261 km / s / kpc , while pme and ecb give @xmath262 km / s / kpc , and @xmath263 km / s / kpc , correspondingly .    to avoid zero denominators",
    ", we used an alternative form of interpolating functions @xmath264 where @xmath265 is a small imaginary part .",
    "the modified femf ( referred as mfemf ) gives satisfactory results for the most unstable mode , @xmath266 km / s / kpc ; the next fastest growing mode is also close to the corresponding modes of pme and ecb .",
    "modified femc ( mfemc ) overestimates the growth rate of the most unstable mode by 20 per cent , while for other modes the results are in agreement with mfemf .",
    "note that the modification distorts the shape of the spectrum near the @xmath152-axis ( see , for example , a series of modes near @xmath267 in fig.[fig6](c ) ) .",
    "this paper presents a comparison of methods for finding unstable modes of stellar discs in the framework of linear perturbation theory .",
    "all considered methods are linear eigenvalue problems , allowing us to determine immediately the entire spectrum of unstable modes .",
    "a comparison was carried out using three models , which enables us to analyse advantages of these methods .",
    "unstable modes of the exponential disc with a soft - centred potential were identified equally well by all methods , except for the simplified finite element method ( femc ; * ? ? ?",
    "femc overestimates the frequency of the most unstable mode ( plus 20 per cent for the growth rate , several percent for the pattern speed ) .",
    "all methods , including femc , reproduce well less unstable modes : the bifurcation points are clearly seen , and the numerical values of the frequencies are close .",
    "the second model ( mestel disc ) differs essentially from the others by its flat circular velocity profile in the centre , which gives indefinitely growing , @xmath268 , frequencies of stellar oscillations .",
    "the determination of a single unstable mode known with very high accuracy from other work , proved to be a very useful test for the linear matrix methods .",
    "in particular , it was found that the ecb method @xcite based on expansion in a clutton - brock potential ",
    "density basis @xcite is not reliable here .",
    "other methods , in addition to the fundamental mode , give multiple spurious modes that have noticeable growth rates .",
    "the latter can be reduced by using more accurate meshes in action sub - space ( pme ) or radial rings ( fem ) .",
    "the collocation scheme @xcite is fully reliable for the determination of the fundamental mode , despite the restrictions on the mesh parameters in action sub - space .",
    "although the scheme sometimes ` adjusts ' itself to satisfy mathematical relations with the expense of compromising the local continuity and differentiability of to - be - determined functions , the obtained patterns are even smoother than fem ones .",
    "the best results are within 0.5 per cent for the pattern speed , and 0.8 per cent for the growth rate from the test values , and a change of the mesh settings indicates convergence to the test values .",
    "the finite elements methods @xcite for this model give opposite results compared to the first model : femc modes were significantly closer to the test values , while femf overestimates the pattern speed and the growth rate by 6 and 13 per cent respectively . note also that good agreement to the frequency of the test mode was obtained by @xcite for femc using an insufficient interval @xmath269 5 .",
    "we obtained that femc values @xmath270 and @xmath151 converge to the values slightly higher than toomre s test values ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for the third model , we adopted parameters of disc and halo component from the three - component model of our galaxy by @xcite .",
    "the angular velocity profile for the two - component model appeared to be growing in the centre of the disc , so we slightly changed the potential by replacing it with a harmonic one , so that the specified profile became non - increasing .",
    "such a correction should not cause problems , since it affects only a small , hot , and therefore stable region in the centre of the disc .",
    "however , this correction led to fail of fem with interpolating functions proposed by @xcite , which proved to be sensitive to the presence of regions with resonant orbits .",
    "adding an imaginary constant to the denominator of the interpolating functions resolved the problem for the discrete unstable modes with high growth rates .",
    "in the three - component model with a bulge any reasonable value of the pattern speed has the ilr .",
    "since this resonance prevents unstable modes , it needs to be isolated .",
    "a possible way is to cutoff the stellar disc between the ilr and cr , or to consider a high @xmath127-barrier further out from the ilr @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of this model will be carried out in a separate paper .",
    "summarizing , we note that despite the significant progress in the optimization of linear matrix methods made by @xcite , these methods should be used with care .",
    "in particular , the applicability of the ecb is limited by the choice of available basis functions . besides",
    ", the presence of resonant orbits may be crucially important for methods that employ interpolating functions in action sub - space ( ecb and fem ) .",
    "note also that fem methods suffer from systematic overestimates of frequencies .",
    "referee of the paper pointed out to an ` increased rigidity ' phenomenon well - known in any finite element analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we anticipate that fem can be substantially improved by the use of more sophisticated interpolating functions .",
