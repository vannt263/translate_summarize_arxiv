    "if the flow field and magnetic field are well diagnosed in space or laboratory plasmas , the expressions for null - point motion may be used to provide constraints on magnetic field dissipation .",
    "equation [ urmhd ] offers another opportunity to measure the plasma resistivity in the collisional limit .",
    "dedicated laboratory experiments offer an opportunity to investigate plasma flow across null points ( and other topological boundaries ) as well as null point and separator bifurcations .",
    "finally , many results exist in the literature outside of plasma physics on bifurcations of vector fields and topology - based visualization of vector fields .",
    "while communication across disciplines is hindered by differences in terminology , the application of this external knowledge to plasma physics will likely lead to improved physics - based understanding of these processes .",

    "<S> while theoretical models and simulations of magnetic reconnection often assume symmetry such that the magnetic null point when present is co - located with a flow stagnation point , the introduction of asymmetry typically leads to non - ideal flows across the null point . to understand this behavior , we present exact expressions for the motion of three - dimensional linear null points . </S>",
    "<S> the most general expression shows that linear null points move in the direction along which the vector field and its time derivative are antiparallel . </S>",
    "<S> null point motion in resistive magnetohydrodynamics results from advection by the bulk plasma flow and resistive diffusion of the magnetic field , which allows non - ideal flows across topological boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> null point motion is described intrinsically by parameters evaluated locally ; however , global dynamics help set the local conditions at the null point . during a bifurcation of a degenerate null point into a null - null pair or the reverse , </S>",
    "<S> the instantaneous velocity of separation or convergence of the null - null pair will typically be infinite along the null space of the jacobian matrix of the magnetic field , but with finite components in the directions orthogonal to the null space . </S>",
    "<S> not all bifurcating null - null pairs are connected by a separator . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , except under special circumstances , there will not exist a straight line separator connecting a bifurcating null - null pair . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of separators can not be described using solely local parameters , because the identification of a particular field line as a separator may change as a result of non - ideal behavior elsewhere along the field line . </S>"
