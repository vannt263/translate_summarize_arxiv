    "in a previous paper @xcite , a family of fixed - point algorithms for the numerical approximation of nonlinear systems of the form @xmath0 was introduced . in ( [ mm1 ] ) , @xmath1 is a nonsingular @xmath2 real matrix and @xmath3 is an homogeneous function with degree @xmath4 ( this means that @xmath5 ) . among other applications , systems of this form",
    "are very typical in the numerical generation of traveling waves and ground states in water wave problems and nonlinear optics . for the numerical approximation to solutions of ( [ mm1 ] ) ,",
    "the use of the classical fixed - point algorithm is not suitable .",
    "this is due to the fact that if @xmath6 is a solution and @xmath7 stands for the iteration matrix at @xmath6 , then , since @xmath8 is homogeneous of degree @xmath9 then @xmath10 and therefore @xmath11 that is , @xmath9 is an eigenvalue of @xmath12 with magnitude above one .",
    "this makes the iteration not convergent in general .    as an alternative and",
    "based on the petviashvili method , @xcite , the following fixed - point algorithms were considered in @xcite : @xmath13 from @xmath14 and where @xmath15 is a @xmath16 function satisfying the following properties :    * a set of fixed points of the iteration operator @xmath17 coincides with a set of fixed points of ( [ mm1 ] ) .",
    "this means that : ( a ) if @xmath6 is a solution of ( [ mm1 ] ) then @xmath18 ; ( b ) inversely , if the sequence @xmath19 , generated by ( [ mm2 ] ) , converges to some @xmath20 , then @xmath21 ( and , consequently , @xmath20 is a solution of ( [ mm1 ] ) ) .",
    "* @xmath22 is homogeneous with degree @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "the function @xmath22 is called the stabilizing factor of the method , inheriting the nomenclature of the petviashvili method .",
    "actually , formula ( [ mm2 ] ) generalizes the petviashvili scheme , which corresponds to the choice @xmath25 the first part of the work , carried out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , analyzed the convergence of ( [ mm2 ] ) .",
    "the main conclusion was that , compared to the classical fixed - point algorithm , the stabilizing factor acts like a filter of the spectrum of the matrix @xmath12 in the sense that :    * the eigenvalue @xmath26 of @xmath12 is transformed to the eigenvalue @xmath27 of the iteration matrix @xmath28 of ( [ iterop ] ) .",
    "* the rest of the spectrum of @xmath28 is included into the spectrum of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the convergence of ( [ mm2 ] ) depends of the spectrum of @xmath12 different from @xmath9 . from these conclusions ,",
    "several results of convergence can be derived , see @xcite for details .",
    "the motivation of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , several numerical experiments in the literature show that the petviashvili type algorithms are in sometimes computationally slower than other alternatives . in order to continue to benefit from the easy implementation ( one of the advantages of the methods )",
    "the algorithms should improve their performance with the inclusion of some acceleration technique .",
    "a further motivation comes from the known mechanism of some extrapolation methods , @xcite , to transform divergent into convergent cases .",
    "the application of this property to these petviashvili type methods may extend their use to compute traveling waves under more demanding conditions , for example in two dimensions or / and in case of highly oscillatory waves .",
    "the literature on acceleration techniques is very rich with many different families and strategies , @xcite .",
    "this paper will be focused on two types of procedures : the vector extrapolation methods , @xcite and the anderson mixing , @xcite .",
    "we think that the first one is the most widely studied group ; in particular , known convergence results for some of these methods will serve us to justify several examples of transformation from divergence to convergence when generating traveling waves iteratively .",
    "the second family accelerates the convergence by introducing the strategy of minimization of the residual in some norms at each step .",
    "they have been revealed efficient in , for example , electronic structure computations , @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) and , to our knowledge , this is the first time they are applied to the numerical generation of traveling waves .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is then exploring by numerical means the application of these two acceleration methods to the generation of traveling waves through several problems of interest and from the petviashvili type methods ( [ mm2 ] ) and their extended versions derived in @xcite .",
    "with the case studies presented here we have tried to cover different situations of hard computation of the waves as an attempt to give some guidelines of application . in this sense",
    ", the paper provides several conclusions to be emphasized :    * the use of acceleration techniques is highly recommended here since it improves the performance in general and allows to extend the application of the methods to computationally harder situations , with especial emphasis on two - dimensional simulations and highly oscillatory wave generation . * by comparing the two families of acceleration techniques considered in this study , the vector extrapolation methods are in general more competitive for these problems compared to the anderson acceleration methods . among the vector extrapolation methods ,",
    "the polynomial methods provide a better performance in general ( some exceptions can be seen in the experiments below ) . *",
    "the main drawback of the anderson acceleration methods concerns the numerical treatment of the associated minimization problem , since most of the difficulties come from ill - conditioning .",
    "this might be improved by including suitable preconditioning techniques ( here the methods were implemented in a standard way , @xcite ) . however , it is remarkable that when the anderson acceleration methods work , their performance is in general comparable to that of some vector extrapolation methods .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ se2 ] is devoted to a description of the two families of acceleration techniques considered in this study .",
    "this also includes some comments on the implementation and convergence results .",
    "the application of both techniques to the methods ( [ mm2 ] ) is studied in section [ se3 ] through a plethora of numerical experiments involving the computation of different types of traveling waves : ground states , classical and generalized solitary waves as well as periodic traveling waves .",
    "the numerical study will be focused on the two main motivations of the paper : the improvement of the efficiency and the extension of application of the methods to computationally harder problems and where the iteration is initially not convergent .",
    "finally , section [ se4 ] completes the computational study with some illustrations of the application of the acceleration to the extended versions of the algorithms ( [ mm2 ] ) , treated in @xcite and suitable when the nonlinearity in ( [ mm1 ] ) contains several homogeneous terms with different degree .",
    "some concluding remarks are in section [ se5 ] .",
    "besides the local character of the convergence , in some cases and compared to other alternatives , fixed point algorithms has the additional disadvantage of a slow performance . in",
    "what follows , several techniques of acceleration will be considered and applied to the methods ( [ mm2 ] ) , with the aim of improving their efficiency .",
    "furthermore , as in the case of the classical algorithm , @xcite , some cases of divergence will be transformed to convergent iterations .",
    "this section introduces two families of acceleration techniques : the vector extrapolation methods ( vem from now on ) and the anderson acceleration methods ( aam ) .",
    "we will include a description of the schemes ( including some convergence results ) and some comments on implementation .",
    "the first group of acceleration techniques consists of vector extrapolation methods ( vem ) . for a more detailed analysis and implementation of the methods",
    "see @xcite and references therein . here",
    "we will describe the general features of the procedures and their application to ( [ mm2 ] ) .",
    "two families of vem are typically emphasized in the literature .",
    "the first one covers the so - called polynomial methods ; they include , as the most widely cited , the minimal polynomial extrapolation ( mpe ) , the reduced rank extrapolation ( rre ) and the modified minimal polynomial extrapolation ( mmpe ) methods , @xcite .",
    "the second family consists of the so - called @xmath29-algorithms ; typical examples are the scalar and vector @xmath29-algorithms and the topological @xmath29-algorithm , @xcite .",
    "all the methods share of course the idea of introducing the extrapolation as a procedure to transform the original sequence @xmath30 of the involved iterative process by some strategy .",
    "the polynomial methods are usually described in terms of the transformation ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 where    * @xmath33 . * @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) denotes the @xmath36 matrix of columns @xmath37 . *",
    "@xmath38 stands for the @xmath36 matrix of some columns @xmath39 with @xmath40 as the adjoint matrix of @xmath38 ( conjugate transpose ) .    in ( [ fsec211 ] ) , @xmath41 stands for the moore - penrose generalized inverse of @xmath42 , defined as @xmath43 , @xcite .",
    "different choices of the vectors @xmath44 lead to the most widely used polynomial methods :    1 .",
    "minimal polynomial extrapolation ( mpe ) : @xmath45 .",
    "2 .   reduced rank extrapolation ( rre ) : @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   modified minimal polynomial extrapolation ( mmpe ) : @xmath47 , for arbitrary , fixed , linearly independent vectors @xmath48 .",
    "the formulation of the vem may follow an alternative approach , @xcite .",
    "the transformation ( [ fsec211 ] ) can be computed in the form @xmath49 where the coefficients @xmath50 are obtained from the resolution ( in some sense ) of overdetermined , inconsistent systems @xmath51 for some vectors @xmath52 .",
    "different methods emerge by combining different choices of the norm where the residual vector @xmath53 is minimized with suitable vectors @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for example , assuming @xmath54 , we have :    * rre is obtained by writing ( [ fsec214 ] ) in the form @xmath55 where the @xmath56 solve ( [ fsec215 ] ) with @xmath57 and the euclidean norm with equal weights is used .",
    "* mpe is obtained by using ( [ fsec214 ] ) with @xmath58 where @xmath59 and the @xmath60 solve ( [ fsec215 ] ) with @xmath61 in the sense of minimization with the euclidean norm with equal weights .",
    "* mmpe is obtained from ( [ fsec214 ] ) but where instead of ( [ fsec215 ] ) a system of the form @xmath62 is used . in ( [ fsec216 ] )",
    "@xmath63 , being @xmath64",
    ".    these formulations can be unified by a representation with determinants , @xcite .",
    "this writes the extrapolation steps @xmath65 in the form @xmath66 with @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are scalars that depend on the extrapolation method and where the expansion of ( [ fsec218 ] ) is in the sense @xmath69 with @xmath70 the cofactor of @xmath71 in the first row .",
    "thus in the case of the numerator in ( [ fsec217 ] ) , formula ( [ fsec219 ] ) is a vector , while in the case of the denominator in ( [ fsec217 ] ) , formula ( [ fsec219 ] ) is a scalar .",
    "( see @xcite for the interpretation in terms of the schur complement of a matrix . )",
    "the three previously mentioned polynomial methods correspond to the following choices of @xmath68 :    * mpe : @xmath72 .",
    "* rre : @xmath73 . * mmpe : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 are linearly independent vectors in @xmath76 .    a second family of vem",
    "is called the @xmath29-algorithms .",
    "a description of them may start from the scalar @xmath29-algorithm of wynn , @xcite .",
    "this scalar extrapolation method can be derived from the representation ( [ fsec217 ] ) , ( [ fsec218 ] ) ( in the scalar case ) with @xmath77 ( which are scalars in the scalar case ) .",
    "the corresponding ratio of determinants @xmath78 is called the classical @xmath79- ( or shanks schmidt @xmath80 ) transform , @xcite .",
    "this ratio can be evaluated recursively for increasing @xmath81 and @xmath82 without the computation of determinants or schur complements .",
    "the corresponding formulation is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and works along diagonals on @xmath85 constant .",
    "thus , from ( [ fsec2111 ] ) , formulas ( [ fsec2112 ] ) , ( [ fsec2113 ] ) compute each entry of a triangular array in terms of the previous entries .",
    "the extension of the scalar @xmath29-algorithm to the vectorial case was carried out by brezinski , @xcite , and wynn , @xcite , by using different definitions of inverse  of a vector , see @xcite .",
    "wynn suggests to consider the transpose of the moore - penrose generalized inverse of a vector , @xmath86 leading to the vector @xmath29-algorithm ( vea ) , whose formulas are of the form ( [ fsec2112 ] ) , ( [ fsec2113 ] ) where the scalars are substituted by vectors and ( [ fsec2113 ] ) makes use of ( [ fsec2114 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the @xmath79-transform ( [ fsec2111 ] ) is understood in the above described vectorial sense .",
    "this is called the generalized shanks schmidt ( gss ) transform , @xcite . on the other hand , brezinski defines the inverse of pair of vectors @xmath87 such that @xmath88 as the pair of vectors @xmath89 where @xmath90 thus , @xmath91 is called the inverse of @xmath92 with respect to @xmath93 and viceversa .",
    "this definition leads to the so - called topological @xmath29-algorithm ( tea ) , when an arbitrary vector @xmath20 is fixed and the inverses of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are considered with respect to @xmath20 , that is @xmath96 the recursive formulas are @xmath97 brezinski proved , @xcite , the connection with the gss - transform , showing that @xmath98 for an efficient implementation of ( [ fsec2115 ] ) see @xcite .",
    "thus ( tea ) corresponds to take @xmath99 in ( [ fsec217 ] ) , ( [ fsec218 ] ) .",
    "the mechanism of working of the vem can be described as follows , see @xcite for details .",
    "one starts from assuming an asymptotic expression for the sequence @xmath100 of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 , ordered such that @xmath104 if @xmath105 with only a finite number of @xmath106 having the same modulus .",
    "the expansion ( [ fsec212 ] ) can be generalized by considering , instead of constant vectors @xmath107 , polynomials @xmath108 in @xmath82 with vector coefficients of the form @xmath109 with @xmath110 linearly independent in @xmath76 and where if @xmath111 then @xmath112 , @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", the description below will make use of ( [ fsec212 ] ) .    the asymptotic expansion ( [ fsec212 ] ) is considered in a general vector space ( finite or infinite dimensional ) where the iteration is defined .",
    "it is understood in the sense that any truncation differs from @xmath100 in less than some power of the next @xmath113 .",
    "this means that for any positive integer @xmath8 there are @xmath114 and a positive integer @xmath115 that only depend on @xmath8 such that for every @xmath116 @xmath117 allows to identify @xmath118 as limit or anti - limit of the sequence @xmath100 , according to the size of @xmath119 .",
    "( that is , if @xmath120 then @xmath121 exists and equals @xmath118 .",
    "if @xmath122 then @xmath121 does not exist and @xmath118 is called the anti - limit of the sequence @xmath100 . ) under these conditions , several results of convergence for mpe , rre , mmpe and tea are obtained in the literature , @xcite and references therein . for these methods , one can find an extrapolation step @xmath123 such that @xmath124 ) may explain the convergent behaviour of the extrapolation in some cases . if the @xmath113 s are identified as the eigenvalues of the linearization operator of the iteration at the limit ( or anti - limit ) @xmath118 , then the extrapolation has the effect of translating the behaviour of the iteration to an eigenvalue @xmath125 that may be into the unit disk , even if the previous ones are out of it .",
    "hence , @xmath118 may be anti - limit for the original iteration and the extrapolation converges to it .",
    "these results are extended to the defective linear case with more general polynomials ( [ fsec212b ] ) in @xcite .",
    "the integer @xmath123 is related to the concept of minimal polynomial @xmath126 of a matrix @xmath42 with respect to a vector @xmath92 , @xcite ; this is the unique polynomial of least degree such that @xmath127 thus in the case of linear iteration with matrix @xmath42 , @xmath123 is taken to be the degree of the minimal polynomial of @xmath42 with respect to the first iteration @xmath128 . in the case of a nonlinear system written in fixed point form",
    "@xmath129 then @xmath123 is theoretically defined as the degree of the minimal polynomial of @xmath130 with respect to @xmath128 , where @xmath6 is a solution of ( [ fsec2110 ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the linear case , there is no way to determine @xmath123 in advance for the nonlinear case .",
    "this forces to consider several strategies for the choice and the corresponding implementation , see the discussion in @xcite and the comments here below .",
    "we also mention that in the linear case , the extrapolation methods mpe and rre are mathematically equivalent to the method of arnoldi , @xcite , and the gmres , @xcite , respectively , see @xcite , while the mmpe is mathematically equivalent to the hessenberg method , @xcite and tea to the method of lanczos , @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "efficient and stable implementation of the rre , mpe and mmpe methods by using qr and lu factorizations can be seen in @xcite .",
    "for the case of tea , see @xcite and @xcite for vea .",
    "the implementation is usually carried out in a cycling mode .",
    "a cycle of the iteration is performed by the following steps : consider a method ( [ mm2 ] ) with a stabilizing factor @xmath22 satisfying ( p1 ) , ( p2 ) .",
    "given @xmath14 and a width of extrapolation @xmath131 , for @xmath132 , the advance @xmath133 is :    * set @xmath134 and compute @xmath135 steps of the fixed - point algorithm : @xmath136 * compute the extrapolation steps ( [ fsec217 ] ) with any of the methods described above and @xmath137 .",
    "* set @xmath138 and go to step ( a ) .    the cycle ( a)-(b)-(c ) is repeated until the error ( residual or between two consecutive iterations ) is below a prefixed tolerance , a maximum number of iterations is attained or the discrepancy between the stabilizing factor at the iterations and one is below a prefixed tolerance .    the width of extrapolation @xmath135 depends on the choice of the technique : @xmath139 for mpe , rre or mmpe and @xmath140 for vea or tea , @xcite .",
    "since @xmath123 is generally unknown , some strategy for the implementation must be adopted . in practice , as discussed in @xcite , the methods are implemented with some ( small ) values of @xmath135 and take that with the best performance",
    ". it may be also different for each cycle , although quadratic convergence is not expected if @xmath123 is too small .",
    "this choice of @xmath123 will be computationally studied in some examples in section [ se3 ] .",
    "the hypotheses for the expansion ( [ fsec212 ] ) include the conditions @xmath141 .",
    "in many problems for traveling wave generation , @xmath142 appears as eigenvalue of the iterative technique ( of fixed point type ) although under especial circumstances that allow to extend the convergence results in some sense .",
    "this especial situation is related to the presence of symmetries in the equations for traveling waves . in order to extend the results of convergence to this case",
    ", one has to consider the orbits by the symmetry group of the equations and interpret the convergence in the orbital sense , that is a convergence for the orbits . the description of this orbital convergence can be seen in @xcite .",
    "finally , local quadratic convergence is proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the four methods and vea for a general nonlinear system ( [ fsec2110 ] ) and under the following hypotheses on @xmath143 :    * the jacobian matrix @xmath144 does not have @xmath142 as eigenvalue .",
    "* @xmath81 is the degree of the minimal polynomial of @xmath144 with respect to @xmath145 . *",
    "the algorithm is implemented in the cycling mode where @xmath123 is chosen in the @xmath146-th cycle as the degree of the minimal polynomial of @xmath144 with respect to @xmath147 .",
    "this result can be extended to the case where @xmath148 admits a @xmath149-parameter ( @xmath150 ) group of symmetries and , consequently , @xmath142 is an eigenvalue of @xmath144 , by using the reduced system for the orbits of the group and in the orbital sense , @xcite .",
    "this would lead to quadratic orbital convergence but linear local convergence .",
    "a second family of acceleration techniques considered here is the so - called anderson family or anderson mixing , @xcite .",
    "it is widely used in electronic structure computations and only recently it has been analyzed in a more general context , @xcite .",
    "( to our knowledge , this is the first time that aam are applied to accelerate traveling wave computations . )",
    "the main goal of the approach consists of combining the iteration with a minimization problem for the residual at each step . for linear problems ,",
    "this technique is essentially equivalent to the gmres method , @xcite .",
    "the stages for an iteration step are as follows : given @xmath151 , set @xmath152 . for @xmath153",

    "one way to reduce this extra effort is the so - called multisecant updating @xcite .",
    "( this also clarifies the connection with quasi - newton methods . ) this technique consists of writing the problem in an equivalent form @xmath160 but with a more direct resolution , and determining the acceleration from it .",

    "two particular members are emphasized : the type - i method ( denoted by aa - i from now on ) , which corresponds to @xmath173 in ( [ aaalternative2 ] ) and type - ii method ( or aa - ii ) , which is the original anderson mixing ( [ aaalternative ] ) .    to our knowledge",

    "finally , @xcite gives some proofs of convergence of the anderson acceleration when applied to contractive mappings : @xmath23-linear convergence of the residual for linear problems under certain conditions when @xmath174 and local @xmath175-linear convergence in the nonlinear case .",
    "( these types of convergence are defined in the paper . )    on the other hand , as observed in @xcite , the implementation of aam should be carried out by attending to three main points : a convenient formulation of the minimization problem ( [ minimize ] ) , a numerical method for its efficient resolution and , finally , the parameter @xmath176 , which plays a similar role to that of the extrapolation width @xmath135 in the vem . in our computations below , we have followed the treatment described in @xcite .",
    "this is based on the use of the unconstrained form ( [ minip ] ) and its numerical resolution with @xmath177 decomposition . for other alternatives in both problems , see the discussion in @xcite and the references cited there .",

    "as far as the choice of @xmath176 is concerned , a similar strategy to that of @xmath135 will be used , since our experiments , @xcite , suggest that @xmath176 ( as @xmath135 ) strongly depends on the problem under study and large values are not recommended .",
    "finally the codes are implemented by retaining the definition of @xmath178 since other alternatives , @xcite , did not improve the results in a relevant way .",
    "presented here is a comparative study on the use of vem and aam as acceleration techniques from the petviashvili type methods ( [ mm2 ] ) in traveling wave computations .",
    "the comparison is organized according to two main points : the type of traveling wave to be generated and the elements of each family of methods to be used for the generation .",

    "the accuracy of the iteration is checked in figure [ figuresw1 ] .",

    "in this paper we have studied numerically the use of acceleration techniques applied to fixed point algorithms of petviashvili type to generate numerically traveling waves in nonlinear dispersive wave equations .",
    "the comparison has been established between vector extrapolation methods and anderson acceleration methods for different types of traveling waves . from the plethora of numerical experiments ,",
    "our main conclusions are :    * the use of acceleration techniques improves the performance of the petviashvili type methods in all the cases .",
    "this improvement is observed in two main points : first , when the petviashvili type method is convergent , the acceleration reduces the number of iterations in a relevant way .",
    "( in some cases , this is really important : in some one - dimensional problems , the reduction is at least of @xmath271 and attains up to @xmath272 . ) on the other hand , the mechanism of acceleration , especially in the case of vem , allows to transform initially divergent sequences into convergent processes .",
    "this is particularly relevant in traveling waves with high oscillations .",
    "furthermore , acceleration has been shown to be more efficient than other alternatives for some cases , like numerical continuation . * in general , vem provide better results and among them , polynomial methods such as mpe and rre are more efficient than @xmath29-algorithms like vea and tea , although in some convergent cases the acceleration in terms of the number of iterations is very similar among all the methods while in computational time the @xmath29-algorithms work better . * the aam are competitive in some cases but they are mostly affected by ill - conditioning and a more computational effort due to their longer implementation . the best results of these methods are obtained when generating numerically periodic traveling waves in some nonlinear dispersive systems and ground state profiles in nls type equations , while their performance is poor when computing highly oscillatory traveling waves .",
    "their application to the e - petviashvili type methods suggests an uncertain behaviour with respect to relevant quantities of the problem through the iteration .",
    "the main question to that this comparative study has not been able to answer is in the authors opinion finding a deeper understanding of the way how acceleration techniques ( especially vem ) work on these problems . in particular , we miss some conclusions about the width of extrapolation ( which is related to the extrapolation step for convergence ) to be used a priori ( if it is possible to do that ) . we have observed that this looks to be strongly dependent on the problem under study .",
