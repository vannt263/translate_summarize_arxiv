    "quantum discord , which is defined as the difference between the quantum versions of two analogous classically equivalent definitions of mutual information , captures all types of nonclassical correlations including entanglement  @xcite .",
    "although entanglement and qd are equivalent for pure states  @xcite , qd is found to be nonzero for some separable states  @xcite .",
    "such states were shown to be useful in the deterministic quantum computations with one pure qubit context  @xcite .",
    "therefore qd is believed a new resource for quantum computation .",
    "the nonlocality as measured by the violation of bell s inequalities is also a signature of the inseparability of a quantum state and signifies entangled states whose correlations can not be reproduced by a classical local hidden - variable model  @xcite .",
    "however it must be emphasized here that the presence of entanglement does not always imply violation of bell s inequalities , while the violation of bell inequalities implies entanglement .",
    "such entangled states violating bell s inequalities play a central role in some applications in quantum information science  @xcite , such as to guarantee the safety of device - independent key distrubition protocols in quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "the relations among different measures of quantum correlations and their dynamical behaviour have been an active area of research with an aim to understand the fundamental question of what quantumness is as well as to characterize these correlations as useful resources for various quantum tasks  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important obstacle to realizing quantum operations is the interaction between the qubits and the environment which tends to wipe out the quantumness of the system  @xcite .",
    "characterization of the effect of environment on the system such as decoherence and dissipation is important .",
    "the dynamics of quantum correlations such as entanglement , quantum discord and bell nonlocality for a two - qubit system subject to various environments have been studied by many groups recently  @xcite .",
    "entanglement sudden death  ( esd ) is one of the new concepts that arise within the context of these studies  @xcite .",
    "esd refers to death of entanglement between two qubits in a finite time while the coherence of the single qubit decays only exponentially . in",
    "contrary to entanglement , qd is more robust in a decohering environment , actually it was shown that almost all states have non - zero quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "qd was shown to decay exponentially in markovian environments , even at finite temperatures  @xcite and can become zero momentarily under non - markovian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "qd was also experimentally investigated in an all - optical set up recently  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , qd and entanglement were analyzed for a heisenberg spin chain with quantum phase transitions and qd was found to detect the critical points of the transition at finite temperatures while entanglement could not  @xcite .",

    "_ investigated the induced quantum correlations between two qubits coupled to a common environment modelled by ising spin chain in a transverse field and during the time evolution , non - zero quantum discord is found to be created for specific initial states whereas entanglement can not be induced  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite quantum discord is found to be totally unaffected by non - dissipative noise for a long time interval under certain conditions , while entanglement decays to zero quickly .",
    "these remarkable properties of quantum discord makes it more practical than the entanglement to characterize quantum correlations .",
    "as mentioned , the nonlocality is curicial for some applications in quantum information .",
    "therefore , many theoretical studies have been devoted to the comparision of entanglement and the violations of bell inequalities  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated by several authors that the survival time for entanglement is much larger than that of the bell - inequality violation  @xcite . in ref .",

    "_ showed that bell inequality might not be violated for a state with high entanglement for a two - qubit system subject to amplitude damping  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nonlocal entanglement between two qubits subject to classical dephasing environment modelled as ornstein - uhlenbeck noise has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , very recently , and it was demonstrated that the strong non - markovian effect can protect the nonlocal entanglement  @xcite . additionally , the nonlocal entanglement induced by the qubit - qubit interaction is found to be protected against the sudden death despite the strong influence of the environmental noise for a certain class of initial states regardless of whether the environment is markovian or non - markovian  @xcite .",
    "although the dynamical relation between the entanglement and quantum discord as well as entanglement and bell nonlocality for a bipartite system subject to different environments have been investigated by a large number of groups as mentioned above , further investigations would help in clarifying the relation of these three correlation measures .",
    "along these lines , in the present paper , we have investigated the dynamics of quantum correlations such as quantum discord , entanglement and bell nonlocality between two qubits in a lossy cavity .",
    "very recently , entanglement , bell nonlocality and quantum discord have been studied in cavity qed  @xcite .",
    "most of them assume identical atoms , or the atom - cavity resonant case , or only one excitation . here",
    ", we have investigated the effect of atom - cavity detuning and cavity decay rate on the corresponding correlation measures for a system which is initially prepared in separable or maximally entangled state .",
    "the most important results of the present study are : depending on the initial preparation of the system and the type of the detunings between the frequency of the cavity mode and the transition frequency of the qubits , the induced quantum discord is found to increase for a long time under cavity decay loss mechanism for certain conditions , while there is no increase in entanglement and bell nonlocality . in some situations ,",
    "the quantum discord is induced even while the atoms remain separable at all times .",
    "also , the preservation of induced entanglement and quantum discord was observed under strong dissipation for certain type of initial states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the model is introduced and the exact differential equations governing the dynamics of two atoms and single cavity mode are derived . the correlation measures ; concurrence , chsh - bell inequality and quantum discord are also introduced , briefly . in secs .",
    "[ cavity1 ] and  [ cavity2 ] , the effect of cavity damping on the corresponding correlation measures are revealed for different detunings for the atoms initially prepared in separable or maximally entangled state .",
    "the summary of the important results is given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "here we consider two two - level atoms with excited states @xmath0 and ground states @xmath1 interacting with a single - mode cavity field of frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is given as  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the transition frequencies for the atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the annihilation and creation operators for the field and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coupling constants to the cavity mode for the atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "when maximum two - photon is considered to be present in the cavity  ( i.e. , the total excitation is equal to two ) and if there is no dissipation in the cavity modes , the closed form of the total state vector at any time may be written as  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13  @xmath14 are the time - dependent probability amplitudes .",
    "for example , @xmath15 represents that the atoms are in their ground states while there are two photons inside the cavity . for this case , the dynamics of the atoms and single mode cavity field can be solved by using time - dependent schrdinger equation and recently many studies have been reported for this case  @xcite . on the other hand , when cavity decay is taken into account , since the cavity decay only changes the number of photons inside the cavity , the atoms and the cavity mode can be found in any of the states  @xcite : @xmath16 .",
    "then the density matrix of the system of two atoms interacting with a single mode cavity field will evolve according to the master equation  @xcite : @xmath17-\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(a^{\\dagger}a\\rho-2a\\rho a^{\\dagger}+\\rho a^{\\dagger}a\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xmath20 are the spin inversion operators . here the first term in eq .",

    "we will restrict ourselves for the initial states : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",

    ". one should note that it is quite difficult to obtain an analytic solution for this set of coupled differential equations , therefore we will solve these equations numerically for the considered initial states .",
