    "the eruptive stars with peak luminosity between those of novae and supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) form a heterogenous group @xcite with many enigmatic objects , and with no consensus on how to name them .",
    "we will refer to objects in this group as intermediate - luminosity optical transients ( ilots ; @xcite ) , but note that red novae , optical transients , and red transients are also in common use , for at least some of these objects .",
    "not only is the name for these objects not in consensus , but also the powering processes of many of them and whether they are due to binary interaction or are formed through single star evolution are debated .",
    "since this is a heterogenous group , it may consist of several subtypes differing by their origin and cause .",
    "the focus of this study is ilots whose pre - outburst objects are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or extreme - agb ( eagb ) stars , e.g. , ngc  300  ot2008 - 1 ( ngc  300ot ; @xcite ) and sn  2008s @xcite .",
    "there are single star models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and binary stellar models @xcite for ilot events harboring agb stars .",
    "the single star mechanisms that were listed by @xcite for eagb - ilots are the formation of massive onemg wd , electron capture supernovae ( ecsne ; also @xcite for sn 2008s ) , iron core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , and outbursts of massive @xmath3 stars . @xcite",
    "derived the total radiated energy in the ngc  300ot outburst to be @xmath4 , and concluded that the ngc 300ot was an eruption of a @xmath3 star that cleared the surrounding dust and initiated a bipolar wind .",
    "they mention an unexplained failed sn , a binary merger , or a photospheric eruption , as possible mechanism for the ngc  300ot outburst . @xcite",
    "found velocities in the range of @xmath5 in the outburst of ngc  300ot , and concluded based on these , the luminosity , and an overall similarity to the ilots sn  2008s @xcite and m85  ot2006 - 1 that the outburst did not result in a complete disruption of the progenitor .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the formation of a massive onemg wd in the single - star scenario for eagb - ilots might form a bipolar pne .",
    "the connection between these ilots and bipolar pns was mentioned also in the binary model for eagb - ilots @xcite .",
    "@xcite already made a connection between ngc  300ot and pre - pne , and raised the possibility that the progenitor of ngc  300ot was of mass @xmath6 .",
    "recently more pne were suggested to have part of their nebula ejected in an ilot event , e.g. , kjpn  8 @xcite . in the binary model a companion star , mostly a main sequence ( ms ) star , accretes part of the mass ejected by the evolved star .",
    "the gravitational energy released is channelled directly to radiation and to kinetic energy of the ejected mass .",
    "the interaction of the gas ejected in the event with previously ejected gas further increases the radiated energy .",
    "a large fraction of the ejected gas can reside in jets launched by the accreting companion star .",
    "the jets lead to the formation of a bipolar nebula , such as the homunculus  the bipolar nebula of eta carinae @xcite  that was formed in the nineteenth century great eruption of eta carinae .",
    "@xcite performed a thorough analysis of the dust destruction by the shock breakout luminosity of sn  2008s and ngc  300ot , and the dust reformation .",
    "( the ` shock breakout ' moment refers to the time when photons behind the shock expand freely to the observer .",
    "this occurs when the shock front is near the photosphere . )",
    "@xcite concluded that the progenitors were red supergiants , and found that the required shock breakout luminosities were of order @xmath7 , and hence the outbursts in both systems were explosive in nature .",
    "however , he could not tell whether the progenitors survived the outburst .",
    "based on @xcite , @xcite adopted an expansion speed of @xmath8 for ngc  300ot .",
    "@xcite noted expansion speeds of about @xmath9 in sn  2008s , and estimated that it ejected @xmath10 in the outburst , and radiated @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite estimated the ejected mass and radiated energy to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for sn  2008s and ngc  300ot , respectively .    in this study",
    "we examine the implications of such outbursts which are powered from within the stellar core .",
    "we aim at answering the following questions .",
    "( 1 ) what are the typical energies required to account for the observed outbursts ?",
    "this question is motivated by the binary - model for these outbursts where the energy comes from accretion onto a companion . in the binary model a large fraction of",
    "the liberated energy goes directly to radiation or to kinetic energy which is later channelled to radiation by wind collisions .",
    "we will find that the efficiency of the single - star model is very low .",
    "( 2 ) can such outbursts leave a large fraction of the envelope bound ? namely , does the star survive the outburst ?",
    "this question is also motivated by the binary - model , where most of the envelope of the primary star stays bound .    in section [ sec : ejection ]",
    "we derive the total energy that is deposited in the envelope from requirements on the ejected gas , and find that most of the envelope must be ejected to account for the velocities of the ejected mass .",
    "our findings are similar to those of @xcite who performed 1d simulations of the same process for @xmath16 stellar models . in section [ sec : shockb ] we derive the energy deposited to the envelope from the required luminosity during the shock breakout , and our short summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",

    "this power - law density profile is presented with the red dash - dot line in fig .",
    "[ fig : agbm ] and [ fig : ysgm ] .",
    "( 3 ) the explosion energy @xmath43 originated from the core region and within a time much shorter than the dynamical time in the envelope .",
    "this assumption allows us to treat the explosion as an instantaneous release of energy from the center of symmetry .",
    "( 4 ) we assumed that radiation pressure dominates the thermal pressure so that the gas can be treated as a @xmath44 fluid .",
    "although this assumption is not accurate for slow shocks , we will nevertheless present results for relatively slow shocks as well , where the gas pressure is higher than the radiation pressure , in order to estimate the outcome . in section [ subsec : solution ] below",
    "we argue that higher values of @xmath45 will only strengthen our conclusions .",
    "( 5 ) as the pre - shock pressure , i.e. , the pressure in the envelope , is much lower than the post - shock pressure , we neglect the pre - shock pressure altogether .",
    "these assumptions imply that the solution asymptotically approaches the self similar solution for a shock wave .",
    "we note that the power - law density profile given in equation ( [ eq : density1 ] ) does not fit the inner part and the very outer part of the agb envelope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agbm ] ) , and the outer part of the ysg envelope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ysgm ] ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of the mismatch in the very outer part of the envelope in section [ subsec : solution ] .",
    "we turn now to present the self similar solution to the shock .",
    "we follow the self similar solution as described by @xcite , for a shock wave travelling through an envelope with a density profile given by equation ( [ eq : density1 ] ) ; see corrections in @xcite . the equations describing the post shock variables when the shock reaches @xmath46 are , @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50^{{(5-\\omega)}{2 } } t_{\\rm end}= r_{\\rm * } ^{9/7 } a^{-1/2 } , \\label{eq : selfsimvar4}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the specific kinetic and internal energies , respectively , @xmath53 is the time when the shock reaches the radius of the star @xmath46 , and @xmath54 is determined by requiring energy conservation , @xmath43 being the total energy deposited in the envelope . for the solutions presented here",

    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]      we aim at examining how much energy is left in the envelope after the shock had passed , and in particular what fraction of the envelope has a positive energy , and hence will be ejected .",
    "the constraints on the solution from observations , as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , are that the shock should accelerate a mass of @xmath58 to velocities of @xmath59 .",
    "we note that there is a steep density gradient at the edge of the envelope , with a slope much larger than @xmath56 .",
    "in such a steep envelope a shock can accelerate gas to velocities of @xmath60 times the initial shock velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such an acceleration in a steep density gradient has been suggested by @xcite to explain sn  2011ht as a sn impostor . for that reason we consider a solution with shock velocities down to @xmath61 . in that case",
    "the post - shock gas pressure dominates the radiation pressure , and taking the adiabatic index to be @xmath55 gives only a crude solution .",
    "however , this is adequate to our purposes and the other approximations , e.g. , the stellar structure .",
    "moreover , since the adiabatic index corresponds to the number of internal degrees of freedom , a larger adiabatic index , as would be the case when thermal pressure dominates , implies that more energy is available for expelling the envelope of the star .",
    "the results of @xcite show that the mass accelerated to high velocities in a steep density gradient is a small fraction of the gas mass travelling at lower velocities .",
    "for example , to eject @xmath62 at @xmath63 by post - shock gas at velocity of @xmath64 , we need @xmath65 of gas moving at @xmath64",
    ".    the initial density profile of the self similar solution given in equation ( [ eq : density1 ] ) does not include the core mass .",
    "the core mass @xmath66 must be included in calculating the gravitational energy of the envelope .",
    "for that , in calculating the specific gravitational energy of a mass element at radius @xmath67 , @xmath68 , we add the core mass @xmath66 to the self - similar mass inner to @xmath67 , @xmath69 .",
    "for the same reason , our approach to the self - similar solution can not deal with the mass that started within the core radius .",
    "we therefore present results just for the gas that started in the envelope , and the graphs below do not start at @xmath70 .    in figure",

    "there is one clear implication from the behavior of @xmath78 : to eject a small amount of mass from the surface at more than the escape speed , implies that almost the entire envelope is lost .",
    "our results are similar to those of @xcite who were aiming indeed at explaining massive envelope removal .",
    "namely , the star is seriously disrupted , it can not return to its previous structure , and also can not experience repeated ilot events .",
    "very small amounts of gas , below those required by the observations described in section [ sec : intro ] , can be ejected because of the steep density profile on the stellar surface .",
    "typically , at velocities of three times the shock velocity ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". the results of @xcite show that the mass accelerated to high velocities in a steep density gradient is a very small fraction of the gas mass at lower velocities .",
    "for example , to eject @xmath98 at @xmath63 by post - shock gas at velocity of @xmath64 , we need @xmath99 of gas moving at @xmath64 .",

    "we find that the required energy is @xmath100 , as given by equation ( [ eq : l3 ] ) .",
    "again , the entire envelope is lost by such an energy deposition .",
    "this strengthens the results we have found in section [ subsec : solution ] .",
    "namely , to account for energetic ilots by energy deposited near the core , the entire envelope is lost .",

    "however , if it turns out that in an ilot most of the envelope is ejected , then energy deposition from the core is required , and indeed can account for such a process @xcite .",
    "the problems we find with models based on a shock running through the envelope , as required for a shock breakout uv flash , do not apply to the case were the core excites waves propagating throughout the envelope , as in the wave - driven mass loss in the sn progenitor mechanism proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
