    "as a striking example of quantum communication protocol , teleportation was discovered early on in the development of the field of quantum information processing . with either qubit @xcite and continuous variable flavors @xcite",
    ", experiments were soon to follow @xcite . until now continuous variable teleportation has only been performed with the class of so - called gaussian states @xcite .",
    "however , this alone is not sufficient for universal quantum computation where non - gaussianity of some kind has been shown to be necessary @xcite .",
    "although non - gaussian nonclassical states of light that would allow for such universal operations have been available experimentally for some time in the continuous variable regime @xcite , the major challenge of actually manipulating these states in some gaussian protocol context beyond simple generation has remained mostly unaddressed .",
    "some recent experimental work has reported on successful continuous variable teleportation of a strongly nonclassical state of light @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a close approximation of a schroedinger s cat state generated with the photon - subtraction protocol @xcite is sent through a continuous variable teleporter .",
    "the quality of teleportation is high enough that the output teleported state is also a nonclassical state with a negative wigner function .",
    "the use of a non - gaussian nonclassical state as an input state is the first most noticeable feature of this experiment .",
    "although gaussian states teleportation has been amply studied , due to the complex nature of non - gaussian states and especially mixed non - gaussian states , only few general results exist for this case .",
    "maybe the most general condition for successful teleportation of non - gaussian non - classical states is the necessary but not sufficient @xmath0 threshold on fidelity @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the theoretical work closest to the experimental conditions of @xcite , teleportation success is investigated for the case of a mixture of vacuum @xmath1 and one photon @xmath2 as an input state . on top of these difficulties , to accommodate with the transient nature of the input state used , the teleporter used in @xcite operates on a broad range of frequencies .",
    "this is the second most noticeable feature of this experiment in contrast with typical continuous variable experiments , which only manipulate narrow sidebands of light . to our knowledge , there are actually very few results relevant to the case of multimode teleportation . in @xcite , multimode teleportation of a quantum field",
    "is investigated from the point of view of temporal fluctuations using the photon correlations function @xmath3 . in @xcite , it is shown how to adapt the single - mode teleportation protocol of @xcite to teleportation of a multi - mode field with finite teleportation bandwidth .",
    "both these works attack the problem of multi - mode teleportation from the henseinberg picture and additional considerations are required to handle the case of non - gaussian nonclassical input states .",
    "our main objective in this paper is to attempt to answer both these issues with a theoretical model as simple and efficient as possible . in sec .",
    "[ section_basics ] , we first briefly introduce the teleportation protocol with its usual phase - space formulation and define a criterion of success . in sec .",
    "[ section_input ] , we describe a realistic model of a nonclassical non - gaussian state that faithfully models the input states of @xcite . with this model",
    ", we are able to predict the success of teleportation in a way similar to @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ section_multi ] , we use the heisenberg picture to approach multimode teleportation as teleportation of a quantum field .",
    "we then show how to reduce this quantum field to a single effective mode that describes the temporal properties of the input state . in sec .",
    "[ section_noise ] , we show how to take into account any external noise spectrum in the broadband teleportation operation . finally in sec .",
    "[ section_conclu ] , we compare our model with the recent experimental results of @xcite and conclude .",
    "deciding on success of continuous variable teleportation is a non - trivial problem as it is closely related to the kind of input states and entanglement used , as well as the specific protocol or quantum circuit teleportation is actually used for . for the gaussian case , the fidelity @xmath4 is the usual figure of merit , though @xmath5 loses much of its meaning as a benchmark figure when more general non - gaussian mixed states are used as input states .",
    "while gaussian states can be fully characterized by their first and second moments , which allow figures like fidelity to have some general and useful meaning , such an approach fails with non - gaussian states . because non - classicality itself is an ambiguous property for continuous variable systems with infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces , it is even more complex to decide on a relevant success criterion for continuous variable teleportation of non - classical quantum states . in this paper",
    "we consider the input @xmath6 and output @xmath7 wigner functions of a teleportation process .",
    "we adopt as a criterion of success the successful transfer of negative features of the wigner function .",
    "provided @xmath6 is itself a negative wigner function and having for @xmath6 a precise algebraic expression including the relevant experimental parameters , we want to know what are the requirements on these parameters and on the teleportation process for successful retrieval of negativity in @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to the braunstein - kimble scheme described in @xcite where the teleportation can be expressed in phase space as the following convolution @xmath8 with @xmath9 the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlation parameter and @xmath10 a normalized gaussian of standard deviation @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) . in this case ,",
    "teleportation of nonclassical features such as negativity has been shown to require 3 db of squeezing @xcite , or equivalently a vacuum fidelity of @xmath13 , which is also called the no - cloning limit @xcite . precisely speaking ,",
    "3-db is a lower bound for unity gain teleportation of negativity of any pure or mixed state .",
    "recent work has shown that , given the precise shape of the input state and amount of anticorrelation in the teleportation quantum channel , there actually exists strategies to surpass the 3 db threshold by tuning the gain of teleportation @xcite . however",
    ", unless extremely pure entanglement is used , typical experimental antisqueezing imposes virtually unity gain operation .",
    "furthermore , as this tuning is input dependent , the teleportation setup losses its universal characteristic .",
    "the 3-db threshold is only a lower bound to negativity teleportation and we would like to have a model that predicts better the success or failure of negativity teleportation . in the general case , this is too broad a problem to handle as teleportation is known to be input dependent . from now on , we focus our analysis on the specific case of the photon - subtracted squeezed vacuum that was used as an input state in @xcite .",
    "this family of quantum states has recently attracted a lot of interest both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . from an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) producing a squeezed vacuum @xmath14 with squeezing parameter @xmath15 called the signal mode , a fraction @xmath16 of the output called the trigger mode is tapped and sent to a photon resolving detector to herald non - gaussian states .",
    "various single - mode and multi - mode models exist for this protocol @xcite , and they are essentially equivalent in the limit of small @xmath15 and @xmath16 . to start",
    ", we will assume that a detection event projects @xmath17 on the photon - subtracted squeezed vacuum @xmath18 equal to a squeezed photon @xmath19 .",
    "the wigner function @xmath20 of this reference state is written @xmath21 and has a maximal central negativity of @xmath22 .",
    "although this is a specificity of this particular input state , from now on we will use the value of the wigner function at the origin of phase space as the figure of merit for negativity teleportation . applying teleportation equation on eq . , we find for output negativity @xmath23 @xmath24 which indeed yields @xmath25 for @xmath26 as expected .",
    "@xmath23 will become negative only if the parameter @xmath9 is greater than @xmath27 , equivalent to 3 db of squeezing .",
    "equation is , of course , of little interest since an actual experimental input state will virtually be a mixed state and a more realistic model of input is required .",
    "the experimental input state used in @xcite happens to fit well a simple loss model where the experimental wigner function @xmath6 can be modeled from @xmath20 , the reference state , by applying `` beam - splitter losses '' @xmath28 equivalent in phase space to the operation : @xmath29 with @xmath30 @xcite . the phase space transformation is derived from the action of a fictitious beam splitter with transmission coefficient @xmath31 , which transforms input coherent states @xmath32 into @xmath33 . as was shown in @xcite , it is also possible to express the action of this beamsplitter with a master equation acting on the density matrix @xmath34 . in this case , we would obtain @xmath35,\\quad l[{\\hat{\\rho } } ] = [ { \\hat{\\rho}}{\\hat{a}},{\\hat{a}^\\dag } ] - [ { \\hat{\\rho}}{\\hat{a}^\\dag},{\\hat{a } } ] .",
    "\\label{master_1}\\ ] ]    by using the previous algebraic expression of @xmath20 together with the transformation , we can obtain the exact expression of @xmath6 with any mathematical software .",
    "we rather are interested in the central negativity given by @xmath36 where the negativity threshold @xmath37 depends only on @xmath31 : @xmath38 implies @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_input_neg ] ) .",
    "using this model of imperfect input state we investigate negativity teleportation of @xmath6 by concatenating eqs . and .",
    "the two successive gaussian convolutions are reduced to one , while the phase space rescaling survives the teleportation .",
    "eventually @xmath7 happens to be written in the same form as @xmath6 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 has been changed to @xmath42 in a way similar to classical amplifiers input / output snr rules .",
    "we remark that besides the degradation of the input negativity @xmath43 , the loss parameter @xmath28 has also the effect of decreasing the effective correlation parameter @xmath9 to @xmath44 .    in practical terms",
    ", this means that both operations do not commute and losses at the input stage have more effect on the quality of the overall process than losses at the output stage .",
    "the output center negativity is now expressed as @xmath45 with @xmath46(plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_output_neg ] ) .",
    "as expected for unity gain teleportation , the @xmath47 threshold is still independent of the squeezing parameter @xmath15 and can be expressed as a function of the two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath9 alone by the simple relation ( fig . [ fig_neg_thre ] ) @xmath48    until now , our model of reference state has assumed a pure state with an initial density matrix @xmath49 of the form @xmath50 however , to be more faithful to experimentally produced squeezed photon states , rather than an ideal photon resolving detector , we should consider the unideal projection properties of the geiger silicon avalanche photodiode ( apds ) experimentally used to produce photon subtracted states .",
    "essentially two mixing mechanisms are at work .",
    "first , the on / off character of the apd makes it only able to detect the presence of photons without resolving the actual number of them .",
    "this leads quite naturally to a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) solution to model the apd measurement , as was done in @xcite .",
    "however , the effect is rather marginal if we restrict ourselves to small squeezing @xmath15 and small tapping fraction @xmath16 and we will actually neglect photon components higher than @xmath51 in the trigger channel .",
    "second , the laboratory apd is also characterized by a dark count rate , which will produce false heralding events and induce some statistical mixing of the target state .",
    "when such a false event occurs , no projection happens on the signal mode as no photon is subtracted and the signal mode density matrix is just @xmath52 corresponding to the opo output squeezed vacuum .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath53 that reflects this statistical mixing and write the new reference density matrix @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath53 is related to the modal purity parameter @xmath56 introduced in @xcite by @xmath57 . with @xmath58 ,",

    "[ fig_mix_input_neg2 ] ) @xmath60 correcting for the effect of eq . in the input negativity , output negativity , and",
    "negativity threshold is just a matter of calculating how the wigner function associated to @xmath61 , @xmath62 , evolves in the teleportation process .",
    "this is possible since all the transformations used until now have been linear and therefore we can write    @xmath63    with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "we find for the corrected input negativity the new expression @xmath67 as well as @xmath68 for the corrected output negativity .",
    "input state negativity threshold @xmath37 now gives the following relation between @xmath31 and @xmath53 @xmath69 for nonzero @xmath53 , the input threshold becomes dependent on the squeezing parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we expect the same dependence on the output negativity threshold corrected for @xmath53 , which is now expressed with the following quadratic equation : @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "keeping the only physical solution in the negativity teleportation threshold corrected for @xmath53 becomes ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mix_output_neg ] ) @xmath73    in summary , we have developed in this section a realistic yet simple model to account for the phase - space properties of photon subtracted squeezed vacuum states . with that model we have considered the effect of teleportation on these states and are able to predict the success of negativity teleportation . in the next section we will now show how to take into account the multi - mode aspect of these input states and the multi - mode aspect of broadband teleportation .",
    "the apd triggered non - gaussian state has been shown to have complex multimode properties @xcite .",
    "on one hand , the opo output beam is a continuous wave with a specific squeezing spectrum , while , on the other hand , the apd triggers that herald a non - gaussian state happen at precisely defined times .",
    "intuitively one expects that a given apd trigger induces non - gaussian statistics in the immediate time vicinity of the trigger event to the extent of the opo bandwidth .",
    "when the number of triggering events increases as @xmath16 and @xmath15 increase and more photons end up in the trigger channel , more complex time interference phenomena arise on the signal mode between neighboring photon subtracted wave packets@xcite . fortunately",
    ", in the limit of small @xmath15 and small @xmath16 , a simple two modes picture allows one to efficiently describe the input state and capture most of its experimental properties @xcite .",
    "it involves two effective wave - packet modes , @xmath74 for the signal mode and @xmath75 for the trigger mode , defined by @xmath76 with @xmath77 . preserving the commutators",
    "@xmath78 = 1 $ ] requires @xmath79 . while the exact form of @xmath80 is not really relevant , since the apd detection time is typically much shorter than any other time scale in these continuous wave experiments , @xmath81 will describe the temporal characteristic of the heralded non - gaussian state .",
    "this function will be defined by the opo bandwidth , as well as the possible filtering cavities used on the trigger channel and numerical optimization has shown that the optimal form ( small @xmath15 and @xmath16 , wide filtering cavities ) can be taken as @xmath82,\\ ] ] with @xmath83 the opo decay rate including intra - cavity losses and @xmath84 the light beam carrier frequency@xcite . in short , an apd heralded state behaves as a traveling wave packet of light with non - gaussian characteristics . using the definition of @xmath74 in eq .",
    ", we return to a pure single - mode model for the input state that we write as @xmath85 this expression is still an approximation of reality in the sense that a true multimode description as done in @xcite would require an extension of a broadband squeezing operator @xmath86 on a basis of adequately chosen orthogonal functions @xmath87 . in this case , @xmath86 is expressed as @xmath88,\\ ] ] with @xmath89 . in practice , once a signal mode @xmath90",

    "a special case happens when @xmath95 is a constant at every frequency .",
    "then the operator @xmath86 can be exactly factorized on the orthogonal basis @xmath87 and the expression becomes exact .",
    "in the general case of a non constant function @xmath95 , the expression is nevertheless useful as it only neglects a small amount of entanglement between the different orthogonal modes @xmath92 if @xmath15 is small . as a result , we will use expressions and for our following analysis of multimode teleportation .    to investigate how this multimode aspect translates quantitatively , we express in the heisenberg picture the relation between input @xmath96 and output @xmath97 quadrature operators of teleportation as @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 two auxiliary modes in the vacuum state@xcite .",

    "are written in the same way as eqs . .",
    "thanks to the linearity of transformation and the linear model of input state in the heisenberg picture , multimode teleportation is equivalent to familiar single - mode teleportation , where an effective broadband epr parameter @xmath116 has been defined to take into account the finite bandwidth of entanglement . in short , all the previous formulas of sec .",

    "an interesting and practical situation is the case of pure linear delay @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "if such a phase factor is added by the classical channel to the output modes , its full effect can be absorbed in @xmath137 and auxiliary modes @xmath119 , @xmath138 by using their fourier transforms , @xmath139 so that @xmath140 is related to @xmath141 by a simple time translation @xmath142 as a matter of fact , this is exactly how the experimental teleportation setup used in @xcite behaves , where an optical delay line is used to match the phase answer of the classical channel and cancel this @xmath143 phase factor .    in this section ,",
    "we have developed an efficient model of unity - gain multimode teleportation with the added benefit of being able to use all the results of the previous section . in the next section",
    "we will further use this model to investigate the effects of classical sources of noise in the classical channel and their effect on the teleportation process .",
    "in this section , we try to better understand the effect of classical sources of noise on the teleportation process .",
    "this is an important point to consider as , compared to the single sideband regime , it is much harder to experimentally insulate from external noise a broad range of frequencies at the same time . to throw light on that issue",

    "consider the wave - packet vacuum state @xmath219 defined by @xmath220 as before this is simply done by using the wave - packet mode function @xmath205 as a filtering function in quantum tomography . with this second method , @xmath116 is estimated to be 0.795 in @xcite .",
    "finally , the third and final step consists of checking our prediction of @xmath7 and particularly @xmath221 using all the known parameters .",
    "this is done by evaluating eq . and",
    "we obtain the value @xmath222 , in agreement with the measured output negativity of @xmath223 in @xcite . as before since @xmath224 the value of @xmath221 estimated here is slightly different from the estimation found in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath213 distance between the two states is 0.04 .",
    "overall , the results of sec .",
    "[ section_input ] are numerically in good agreement with the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "our model uses a set of only three parameters and even though more complex models for photon subtracted squeezed vacuum states exist , we found it was not necessary to use them .",
    "this confirms the validity of our initial assumption to only consider the small @xmath16 , small @xmath15 regime .",
    "our approach to multimode teleportation in sec .",
    "[ section_multi ] has the double benefit of intuitively picturing broadband operations in term of wave packets , while at the same time allowing us to use the usual results of single - mode teleportation with simple renormalization prescriptions .    in conclusion",
    ", we have developed an efficient yet simple framework to model the properties of multimode continuous variable teleportation .",
    "although this work is tied to a specific class of non - gaussian states , it is natural to ask if a similar approach can handle more general non - gaussian states .",
    "as it is known that any wigner function can be approximated by successive displacements and photon subtractions , it is in principle possible to describe any non - gaussian states in a systematic way that would be compatible with the gaussian convolutions needed in sec .",
    "[ section_input ] .",
    "a second and harder issue would be to identify criteria more robust than negativity to decide on the success of teleportation and gaussian operations in general in the context of non - gaussian non - classical input states .",
