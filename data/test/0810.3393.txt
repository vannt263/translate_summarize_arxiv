    "the golf - ng instrument ( turck - chize et al .",
    "2006 ) is a 15 points resonant scattering spectrophotometer observing in the blue and red wings of the d1 sodium line .",
    "the sodium cell , where resonant scattering is produced , is placed in a varying permanent magnet ( between 0 and 12  kg ) , and the resonant scattered light ( resulting from , alternatively , left and right circular polarized incident light ) is extracted at eight different positions ( channels ) along the cell , and later collected on a photodiode matrice detector .",
    "four optical fibers are placed around the cell for each channel position , thus increasing the total photon counting rate compared to other existing instruments .",
    "the objective is to reduce at maximum all the instrumental noise sources in order to increase the sensitivity to solar oscillations . in order to validate the instrumental concept and",
    "evaluate its current performances , the golf - ng prototype has been observing the sun at the observatorio del teide ( tenerife ) for a 2008 summer campaign .",
    "the analysis is currently underway and we present here the first preliminary results .",
    "the uncalibrated solar radial velocity @xmath0 is computed at the different channel positions of golf - ng . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the number of photons collected by the detectors coming ( with a 1-second cadence ) from the left and right wings of the nad1 line respectively . figure [ fig : r_and_pw ] shows the uncalibrated ratio @xmath3 and the associated power spectra for the golf - ng channels obtained for a daily run of observations .",
    "the observed power of the 5-minute oscillations varies as we move along the nad1 line , i.e. as we observe at different heights in the solar atmosphere , although the main pattern ( 5-minute band ) is similar .",
    "the daily residual velocities are obtained by fitting the observations as a function of the total line - of - sight velocity computed from the ephemerides .",
    "the output parameters of this procedure are the coefficient k ( instrumental sensitivity ) and the offset velocity ( representative to the instrumental stability ) , and are represented as a function of the golf - ng channels on figs .",
    "[ fig : kcal]a and [ fig : kcal]b .",
    "the daily evolution of the golf - ng instrument ( figs .",
    "[ fig : kcal]c and [ fig : kcal]d ) presents a high day - to - day stability in addition to the expected decreasing trend resulting from the ( provisional ) lack of proper line profile corrections in the calibration process ( pall et al . 1993 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure  [ fig : compa ] compares golf - ng observations with simultaneous observations collected by the space - based golf / soho instrument observing in the na(d1+d2 ) lines ( approximatively the same height as golf - ng channel 4 ) , and by the mark - i instrument  a node of the bison network , operating at the same site as golf - ng and observing in the k line .",
    "figure  [ fig : photon ] shows simultaneous spectra observed by the ground - based golf - ng and space - based golf / soho instruments during @xmath4  10 hours on july 01 , 2008 . the use of multiple fibres at each channel position in golf - ng results in a lower high - frequency noise ( above 8  mhz , region dominated by the photon noise ) and in a better signal - to - noise ratio in the p - mode range ( of a factor @xmath4  3 ) compared to the present golf / soho instrument after 12 years of operation ( garca et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "10 hours of simultaneous observations from golf - ng channel  4 ( green ) and golf / soho ( black).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in this preliminary analysis , we showed that the signature of the 5-minute solar oscillations is observed in the different channels of the golf - ng instrumental prototype .",
    "the high - frequency noise level is lower than the one from the present golf / soho observations . the optimal way to combine the signal collected by the different channels of golf - ng , in order to reduce the noise level at low frequency ( g - mode region ) , is currently under investigation , as well as the study of the main instrumental noise sources and their respective contributions .",
    "if not limited by atmospheric conditions due to the ground - based location of the prototype and by other instrumental factors , we will use the observations from this 2008 summer campaign to study the contributions of the solar noise as a function of the height in the solar atmosphere in the low - frequency range of the power spectra .",
    "technical and instrumental improvements ( turck - chize et al .",
    "2008 ) are in progress in order to reach the nominal performances necessary for the study of gravity modes and the solar atmosphere characteristics .",
    "we thank the technical and instrumental support received from the different iac s services , as well as the operator team from the observatorio del teide , with a special thanks to a.  pimienta .",
    "this work utilizes data from the mark - i instrument , a node of the bison network .",
