    "serrated signals are ubiquitous in  stick - slip \" physical systems ; examples range from earthquakes @xcite , through barkhasuen noise in magnetic systems @xcite , to stress and energy as a function of strain in amorphous solids @xcite .",
    "the analysis of such signals often tends to seek power - laws to describe the statistics of the magnitude of serrated events@xcite . in this paper",
    "we stress that a more complete understanding of the statistics of such phenomena calls for scaling functions which incorporate knowledge of the system - size dependence .",
    "the system size dependence reveals crucial information pertaining to the underlying physics responsible for the serrated signals .",
    "we will show that the examination of the statistics of the magnitude of serrated responses together with the system size dependence may discover important inhomogeneities in the statistics that may escape attention when focusing on power - laws alone . in typical cases",
    "there is more than one physical mechanism contributing to the observed signal , and these mechanism must be identified @xcite .",
    "finally we will show that a full understanding of the statistics of such signals and their scaling properties calls for an examination of the physical processes involved .",
    "after such an examination the picture may clarify considerably and even universal results may be gleaned .",
    "the context of our analysis is the mechanical responses of amorphous solids , and the serrated signals of stress and energy as a function of strain .",
    "thus we will consider the shear stress @xmath0 and the energy @xmath1 as a function of shear strain @xmath2 in amorphous solids @xcite .",
    "since we will only concern ourselves with one component of the stress and strain tensors we denote them below as @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . typically the stress vs strain curves and the energy vs strain curves as measured in amorphous solids exhibit two distinct regions . at lower strain values the stress @xmath3 and the energy @xmath1 increase on the average upon the increase of strain @xmath4 , but this increase is punctuated by plastic events .",
    "a second region , at higher values of the strain , displays a elasto - plastic steady state in which the stress and energy can not increase on the average even though the strain keeps increasing .",
    "we will present an analysis of the statistics of the sharp drops involving plastic events in this second region , where the steady - state properties allow us to gather enough data for accurate statistics @xcite .",
    "typical such shear stress and energy vs. shear strain curves at zero temperature are shown in fig .  [ stress - strain ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to understand the statistics of the complex looking serrated signal in the post - yield steady state regime @xcite .",
    "in this work , we employ a two - dimensional kob - andersen @xcite binary glass - former with a 65:35 ratio of point particles a and b having equal mass @xmath5 , with interaction given by shifted and smoothed lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials , @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",

    "( [ usmooth ] ) and for a and b particle type interactions in eq.([ulj ] ) are given in the following table    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to understand these exponents .",
    "the numerical fit for achieving data collapse is written as @xmath10 the resulting data collapse is shown in fig .",
    "[ smallsig ] .",
    "one should note that with the present choice of rescaling exponents the parts of the pdf s pertaining to the larger stress drops do not collapse on each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fullscale ] ) .        using the rescaled form of the pdf",
    "we can now compute the expected exponents @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting exponents are in reasonable agreement with the list shown in table ii , with errors not exceeding 8 - 9% .",
    "below we will argue that the real picture is in fact much simpler .",
    "the real nature of the small drops becomes apparent when we consider the small energy drops .",
    "we consider now the pdf of the energy drops restricted to small values .     vs the system size .",
    "the lack of change in the slopes indicate the the small energy drops are system size independent in agreement with a localized event.,width=264 ]    as before , we can plot the negative moments @xmath12 as a function of the system size , shown in fig .",
    "[ smallu ] .",
    "evidently there is no difference in the scaling exponents , meaning that the small energy drops are system size independent , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "this is a clear indication that the small drops are associated with localized events , forcing us at this point to consider the physical significance of the analysis discussed so far .",
    "firstly , since the small energy drops are system size independent , we must associate the small drops with localized events @xcite .",
    "but then the stress drops , being intensive rather than extensive like the energy drops , are expected to scale like @xmath14 if the energy drops are proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "we then realize that eq .",
    "( [ smallsig ] ) was only approximate , and that the exact representation of the pdf of the small stress drops must read @xmath16 having realized this , we now check whether using the trivial scaling form ( [ corrscalesmall ] ) collapses the data as well as eq .",
    "( [ scalesmall ] ) .",
    "the answer is yes , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ corrsmall ] .",
    "the quality of the data collapse is as good , if not better .",
    "we therefore can conclude that the small drops occurring in the steady state are in fact regular plastic drops of the type that are prevalent before yield .",
    "these are typical eshelby quadrupolar events which indeed are known to be associated with and energy drop which is system - size independent . with this realization",
    "we can now correct the list of exponents @xmath11 , these should be @xmath17 , very trivial , and the discrepancy with the list in table ii is simply due to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "this leaves us now with the large drops . but",
    "these must be the  micro shear bands \" that were identified and discussed in some depth in refs .",
    "@xcite . in short , these are events that appear only after yield , never before , and they are represented as a concatenated series of eshelby quadrupoles that span the system .",
    "these are in fact plastic events that organize the displacement field to sharply concentrate the shear over a narrow band which traverses throughout the system . accordingly",
    "the number of particles involved must scale like @xmath18 . accepting this",
    ", we must conclude that @xmath19 . to get agreement with @xmath20",
    "we must accordingly assign the theoretical value @xmath21 . since the associate large stress drops are the intensive counterparts of the large energy drops , we are led to the assignment @xmath22 and to get the exact @xmath23 we end up with @xmath24 .",
    "in fig .  [ final ]",
    "we show the final , theoretically propose rescaled pdfs for the large stress and energy drops , and we conclude that they indeed collapse the data , possibly not as well as the numerically optimized ones , but this discrepancy should be only taken as a warning against straight numerics .",
    ".,width=264 ]    to increase the confidence in the theoretical scaling predictions we can now analyze _",
    "separately _ small or large drops , and find the the moments of their fluctuations .",
    "thus for example we can focus on stress drops that obey @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ corrsmall ] ) , and plot their positive moments , see fig .",
    "[ smallsigpos ] .",
    "the slopes of these plots are @xmath26 with errors of less than 1% .",
    "this is of course a direct consequence of the trivial scaling function eq .",
    "[ corrscalesmall ] .",
    "we presented a detailed analysis of a typical  stick - slip \" serrated signal of stress and energy drops in the post yield elasto - plastic steady state of a strain - controlled typical amorphous solid .",
    "numerical data analysis of the rather complex looking signal yielded pdf s whose scaling properties appeared to call for a definition of a number of non - trivial scaling exponents .",
    "further scrutiny however reveled that much of the apparent complexity was due to the mixture between two types of stress and energy drops : small , or system size independent , and large , which were system size dependent .",
    "the inter - penetration of the two types of drops confused the statistical properties of each independent type of events , leading to a complex looking scaling theory which eventually turned out to be unnecessary . at the end the statistics",
    "is very simple , mixing events where @xmath13 and @xmath27 with system spanning shear bands with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is very likely that other serrated signals measured in other  stick - slip \" systems may hide rich mixtures of physical processes in much the same way presented here .",
    "similar care in the analysis of such data should therefore be exercised .",
