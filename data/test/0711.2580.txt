    "the leading model of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) involves a relativistic ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the jet lorentz factor ) fireball jet , where the observed gamma rays are produced by radiation from fermi - accelerated electrons in optically thin shocks ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the most popular model for the more common long - duration grbs , the so - called collapsar model , the core of a massive star collapses to a black hole or neutron star , driving a highly relativistic jet which breaks out of the star  @xcite . within this scenario , high - energy neutrinos from photomeson interactions of accelerated protons",
    "have been studied  @xcite . with @xmath6 size",
    "neutrino detectors such as icecube  @xcite and km3net  @xcite being constructed , we are entering an age when we can test various predictions for high - energy neutrinos .",
    "waxman and bahcall predicted @xmath7 neutrinos from external reverse shocks  @xcite , and similar predictions have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite for the forward shock .",
    "in addition , internal shocks can occur while the relativistic jet is still in the star .",
    "mszros and waxman predicted a @xmath8 neutrino precursor burst from such a set up  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that a precursor neutrino burst is present even if the jet does not successfully break out of the star , producing a choked jet that is dark in gamma rays and bright in neutrinos .",
    "inferring from the observed rate of grbs , highly relativistic ( @xmath9 ) jets occur in perhaps @xmath10 of core - collapse supernovae  @xcite .",
    "however , the jet signature may be more common , and a significantly higher portion of supernovae may be endowed with slower , mildly relativistic jets ; according to late - time radio observations , perhaps as high as a few @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of low - luminosity grb 060218 also suggests from detection rates that low - luminosity grbs , with mildly relativistic ejecta , are more common than conventional high - luminosity grbs by factors as large as @xmath12  @xcite . the occurrence rate is high enough that despite their lower luminosity , their contribution to the neutrino background is comparable to or larger than conventional grbs  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being more frequent , mildly relativistic jets are more baryon rich , which work positively for neutrino emission .",
    "indeed , the detectability of neutrinos from internal shocks of mildly relativistic jets has been studied by razzaque , mszros , and waxman  @xcite and extended by ando and beacom  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in these scenarios ,",
    "internal shocks occur at @xmath13@xmath14 , smaller than the typical radius of type ib progenitors . accelerated protons interact via proton - photon ( @xmath15 ) and proton - proton ( @xmath16 ) interactions to produce mesons , which consequently produce neutrinos on decay .    in this paper",
    "we investigate neutrinos arising from protons that are accelerated in the reverse shock , while the relativistic jet is still propagating inside the star .",
    "we adopt a type ib progenitor as our model star , but we discuss how our results apply to type ic and ii progenitors also . the reverse shock is strongly motivated because it is a generic prediction of the initial stages of any jet moving through the star , regardless of its lorentz factor , and whether it breaks out of the star or not .",
    "therefore , we consider two types of supernovae : one is the perhaps more numerous supernova containing a mildly relativistic ( @xmath17 ) jet , and the other is a supernova containing an ultrarelativistic ( @xmath18 ) jet that can ultimately cause the observed grbs . in both cases we consider choked as well as successful jets , depending on its duration .",
    "we show that protons can be accelerated to @xmath0@xmath1 gev in the reverse shock .",
    "the low and high - energy protons produce mesons efficiently by @xmath16 and @xmath15 interactions respectively . for energies in between , cooling mechanisms are faster , and result in a characteristic suppression feature in the meson spectrum .",
    "mesons that are produced experience significant cooling due to the high proton and photon densities in the shocked jet . however , we still expect a reasonable number of neutrino events .",
    "for instance , for a choked mildly relativistic jet with isotropic energy @xmath19 erg at 10 mpc , we expect @xmath20 neutrino events at icecube from the reverse shock .",
    "interestingly , assuming the same jet lorentz factor , we find that a lower isotropic energy of @xmath21 erg produces more neutrino events ( @xmath22 events ) .",
    "this is due to meson cooling .",
    "specifically , we find that neutrinos are favored by high - lorentz factor , low - luminosity , and long - duration jets , as meson cooling is less significant for such jets .",
    "the rate of core - collapse supernova within 10 mpc is expected to be @xmath313 yr@xmath23  @xcite , implying particle acceleration in reverse shocks can potentially be tested in the next decades .",
    "neutrino emission from the reverse shock is potentially important for short - duration jets that are completely shocked and do not break out of the star , i.e. , choked jets .",
    "we argue that while it is possible that internal shocks occur prior to jet shocking ( in particular for low @xmath5 jets ) , the allowed range of radii for internal shocks to occur is constrained from above by the reverse shock , and below by the fact that the stellar material is opaque to high - energy neutrinos .",
    "this suggests that neutrino emission from choked jets are of similar magnitude to our estimates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the evolution of the jet as it propagates through the star . in sec .",
    "iii we treat proton acceleration , and suppression of neutrino emission due to proton and meson cooling . in sec .",
    "iv we utilize the results of the previous sections to investigate the detectability of high - energy neutrinos from reverse shocks . finally , we finish with discussions in sec .",
    "v and conclusions in sec .",
    "we first discuss the evolution of a relativistic @xmath24 jet as it strikes the stellar matter .",
    "the aim is to obtain the evolution of the jet head and reverse shock velocities .",
    "there are several numerical simulations on the propagation of an initially hot jet in the literature  @xcite , as well as analytic treatments of initially cold jets  @xcite .",
    "we follow and extend the latter .",
    "generally , two shocks form when a jet strikes external matter : a reverse shock that decelerates the head of the jet to a lorentz factor @xmath25 , and a forward shock that accelerates the external material to @xmath25 .",
    "the jet and stellar material moving at @xmath25 are separated by a contact discontinuity , and are in pressure balance .",
    "equations governing the evolution of the shocks are ( for @xmath24 )  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the proton mass and @xmath28 is the speed of light .",
    "thermodynamic quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( particle number density and internal energy ) are measured in the fluids rest frames , and we have used the following notations : @xmath31 ( jet , unshocked ) , @xmath32 ( jet head , shocked ) , @xmath33 ( stellar , shocked ) , and @xmath34 ( stellar , unshocked ) .",
    "lorentz factors are measured in the lab frame , except for @xmath35 which is the lorentz factor of the jet head measured in the frame of the unshocked jet , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the velocity as a fraction of @xmath28 .",
    "the jet particle density is given by ( for a jet with constant opening angle ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the isotropic jet luminosity .",
    "we obtain @xmath25 by equating the pressure of the shocked jet head @xmath40 and the pressure of the shocked stellar matter @xmath41  @xcite . from eq .",

    "we inject jets at a radius @xmath56 along the rotational axis , which corresponds to an enclosed mass of @xmath57 .",
    "since the explosion and jet mechanisms are still under debate , they are treated parametrically with the following parameters : the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath58 and duration @xmath59 ( which yield the isotropic equivalent luminosity through @xmath60 ) , lorentz factor @xmath5 , and variability @xmath61 .",
    "we consider two types of jets , ( i ) mildly relativistic jets with @xmath54 , and ( ii ) ultrarelativistic jets with @xmath55 .    in fig .",

    "the first progenitor model is e20 as described above , and the second is e15 , a similarly rotating star but with initial mass @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "we see that the evolution of @xmath62 is independent of @xmath5 , and that the initial jet head velocity is always subrelativistic .",
    "the latter is because the external density is very much larger than the jet density , @xmath65 , for conceivable set of jet parameters .",
    "as the jet continues to propagate , the stellar density falls faster with radius ( @xmath66 ) than the jet density ( @xmath67 ) , and the jet head effectively accelerates , reaching mildly relativistic values at @xmath68 a few @xmath69 .",
    "although the initial value of @xmath62 scales somewhat with @xmath39 , the radius at which the velocity reaches @xmath28 is only weakly dependent on jet parameters .",
    "this is because the jet head accelerates to relativistic velocities when the external stellar density suddenly drops , at the edge of the he core .",

    "however , the general features of @xmath62 that concern us , including its initially @xmath73 value and its reaching @xmath74 at @xmath75 , are model independent .",

    "this requires a jet duration of @xmath88@xmath89 , depending on the value of @xmath39 .",
    "we summarize duration times in table [ table : times ] .",
    "we note that we could have in principle chosen a smaller @xmath79 due to smaller @xmath77 .",
    "however , as we discuss in sec .",
    "v , the stellar matter becomes opaque to high - energy neutrinos for radii @xmath90 cm , and small radii are uninteresting .",
    "we also note here that rotational effects decrease the matter density along the rotational axis , increasing the jet head velocity at small radii and thereby shortening the core crossing time @xmath76 .",
    "a decrease in density also decreases neutrino opacity .",
    "however , the effect is not expected to be large , because density modifications typically occur at radii smaller than or equal to @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "next we discuss jets that successfully break out of the star , with @xmath92 .",
    "these jets are progressively shocked as they move through the progenitor , but the reverse shock does not cross the entire jet . therefore , for successful jets , only the front portion of the jet is shocked .",
    "we assume @xmath79 just inside of the he core radius . we stress that for successful jets , @xmath79 is _ not _ the point of reverse shock crossing , but the last point of shocking by the reverse shock .",
    "a few words about the jet models must be noted .",
    "first , we have assumed a conical jet geometry in eq .",
    "( [ n_j ] ) .",
    "this is a good approximation for jets propagating in a sufficiently sparse medium , such as the outer regions of stars . from analytic studies , the jet opening angle @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 constant for @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore injected jets at a radius @xmath97 with profile eq .",
    "( [ n_j ] ) . on the other hand , under conditions such as propagation in the dense iron core and/or when strong magnetic fields are associated with the launch of the jet , the high external matter density and/or magnetic hoop stress work to collimate the jet .",
    "numerical studies find that jets remain tightly collimated in the iron core  @xcite , and further beyond the stronger the magnetic field  @xcite . for jets that remain strongly collimated ,",
    "the reverse shock becomes increasingly less important due to the more penetrating nature of the jet .",
    "further , it is less likely for these jets to form choked jets . for illustration , consider an extreme case where a jet of luminosity @xmath98 erg @xmath99 remains tightly cylindrical all the way until break out , with constant cylindrical radius @xmath100 cm  @xcite .",
    "for such a jet , we find that @xmath101 6 s and @xmath102 s.    second , we have assumed a type ib progenitor .",
    "a jet with @xmath103 erg s@xmath23 propagating through a type ic progenitor would clear the core in @xmath104 seconds , and jets are more likely to break out .",
    "third , we have defined successful jets as those which break out of the star .",
    "however , these do not necessarily always produce observable grbs  for small @xmath5 and @xmath61 , internal shocks will occur while the jet is optically thick to photons .",
    "for example , @xmath105 cm ( we define @xmath106 for a quantity @xmath107 in cgs units ) , while the jet typically becomes optically thin to photons at @xmath108^{1/2 } \\sim 10^{14}l_{\\rm{iso},52}^{1/2}\\gamma_{j,1}^{-1/2}$ ] cm , where @xmath109 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "the jet is still transparent to high - energy neutrinos .",
    "we summarize our various jet definitions in table  [ table : jets ] .",
    "to conclude , we use the following crossing radii : ( i ) @xmath110 for choked jets and ( ii ) @xmath111 for successful jets .",
    "in this section we discuss proton acceleration and neutrino production through decays of pion and kaon mesons .",
    "the reverse shock is likely to be collisionless , as we discuss in section iiia .",

    "one reason for this is that proton cooling affects only energies near and below current detector threshold energies .",

    "if we assume a steeper index , @xmath115 2.1 ( 2.3 , 2.5 ) , we expect 4 ( 2 , 1 ) events for jet model b. in all cases , the neutrino flux is dominated by decay of kaons , since cooling is less efficient for kaons than pions",

    "note that supernova and jet parameters are expected to show considerable scatter .",
    "hence , given neutrino emission is cooling suppressed , the event count need not necessarily correlate with the total burst energy .",
    "neutrino emission from the reverse shock is particularly important for choked jets , which are completely shock decelerated by the reverse shock .",
    "is it possible for choked jets to produce more neutrino emission than our above estimates ?",
    "if the duration is long enough such that @xmath250 , it is possible that internal shocks accelerate protons in the unshocked part of the jet , while the jet head is being shocked .",
    "the internal shock accelerated protons do not travel far , producing mesons efficiently via @xmath16 interactions with the large target jet proton density  @xcite . for high - lorentz factor jets , the protons can travel and interact with termination shock photons  @xcite . in both cases meson cooling",
    "is less severe than in the reverse shock , and we can expect more neutrino emission .",
    "however , internal shocks must occur at large enough radii that the stellar material is not opaque to high - energy neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino opacity is @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the column number density of the star and @xmath253 is the sum of neutrino charged - current and neutral - current cross sections , which is approximately @xmath254 in the energy range in question . for a @xmath255 neutrino emitted at @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258  @xcite , and we find that @xmath259 . for a @xmath260 neutrino , @xmath261 .",
    "thus , only neutrinos with energies @xmath262 can leave the star from @xmath263 . clearly , these results depend on the stellar density profile assumed , and rotational effects have been neglected in our simple estimate .",
    "however , it seems clear that the stellar matter is opaque to high - energy neutrinos for small radii , constraining the range of allowed radii for internal shocks .    the case for the reverse shock in successful jets , which break out of the star , seem better .",
    "this however is not due to any intrinsic property of successful jets .",
    "it is merely because for a given total jet energy , successful jets have longer durations and lower luminosities compared to choked jets .",
    "this results in less meson cooling ; for example , we expect 2 events from a choked jet ( of energy @xmath264 ) , while we expect 36 from a successful jet of the same total energy .",
    "however , it should be noted that we expect internal shocks to be important for successful jets .",
    "considering our successful jet with @xmath246 , @xmath240 , and @xmath265 ( so that internal shocks occur at @xmath266 ) , we find that the total muon event number from the internal shock is @xmath3100 times larger than our estimates from the reverse shock  @xcite .",

    "the temporal profile of neutrinos therefore offers the possibility to distinguish locations of particle acceleration for exceptionally close supernovae .",
    "the expected time difference between components is of order a few to tens seconds , which is within the time resolution of neutrino detectors .",
