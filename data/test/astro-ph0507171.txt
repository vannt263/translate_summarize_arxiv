    "as it is well known , the circular symmetry observed in the signals collected by the surface detectors is broken in the case of inclined showers .",
    "evidence of the azimuthal asymmetries in the signal size were first observed at haverah park  @xcite and the first observations of asymmetries in the time structure of the ground detector signals were found in the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal dependence arises mainly due to the different paths traveled by the particles at different azimuth angles . in ground array experiments",
    "the analysis is done projecting the collected signals and time distributions at ground level into the shower plane neglecting the shower evolution .",
    "this results in an azimuth angle dependence in the slant depth , as it was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "+ the observed asymmetry in the time distributions offers a new possibility for primary composition determination , because its magnitude is strongly dependent on the muon to electromagnetic ratio at ground .",
    "we have done a preliminary study on the information in time distributions using simulations of proton and iron initiated showers with the aim of estimating the sensitivity of the pierre auger observatory for hadronic primary discrimination  @xcite .",
    "the following observables were analyzed:``rise - time '' ( defined as the time between the 10% and 50% of the integrated signal ) and `` fall - time '' ( time between the 50% and 90% of the integrated signal ) .",
    "these variables were studied as a function of the azimuth angle in the shower plane at fixed core ranges and zenith angles , for showers initiated by proton and iron primaries .",
    "+ in this paper we describe a new observable related to the asymmetry factor of the time structure of the signal in the water - erenkov detectors of the pierre auger observatory useful to discriminate composition .",
    "most of the observables related to composition are like a snapshot of the shower development and then , are correlated with @xmath2 and the atmospheric depth .",
    "the time distribution of the signals contains implicitly the information of the shower development .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect a dependence of the mean values of `` rise - time '' and `` fall - time '' , and the corresponding asymmetries observed , with the atmospheric depth . + if we call @xmath3 the atmospheric slant depth , @xmath4 with @xmath5 along the shower axis , then , @xmath6 . we can treat this dependence in a first approximation using a taylor expansion in slant depth around @xmath7 keeping only the first term , considering that the azimuth angle correction is small compared to the slant depth .",
    "this is equivalent to using a linear function in cosine of the azimuth angle in the shower plane , @xmath8 ( defined with @xmath9 in the incoming direction of the shower ) to describe asymmetries in data .",
    "+ in vertical showers , a generic time distribution @xmath10 will be function of @xmath11 , the atmospheric depth along the shower axis , and @xmath12 , the core distance perpendicular to the shower axis . for inclined showers , @xmath13 .     for 100 eev for proton ( @xmath14 ) and iron ( @xmath15 ) for 25 , 45 and 60 from top to bottom , scaledwidth=100.0%",

    "+ for the present monte carlo study , we use proton and iron initiated showers generated with aires 2.6.0 /qgsjet01 with primary energies @xmath20 ev and @xmath21 ev and zenith angles between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 1.103 , 1.221 , 1.414 , 1.743 and 2 ) .",
    "the detector response of the pierre auger observatory was simulated ( using the official simulation and reconstruction tool , offline v1r2 ) with the sdsim module in the full array configuration and with all the parameters in their default values .",
    "the resulting data were reconstructed using the reconstruction modules .",
    "the sample used consisted in 20 showers for @xmath20 ev protons , 25 showers for @xmath20 ev irons and 30 showers for @xmath21 ev proton and iron each , for each angle considered .",
    "the dependence of the `` rise - time '' and `` fall - time '' with azimuth angle was fitted using the functional dependence , @xmath25 . in figures  [ fall - zeta ] and  [ rise - zeta ]",
    "we show the mean value of the timing distributions divided by core distance for proton and iron primaries as a function of @xmath8 for the case of primary energy @xmath21ev .",
    "the fit was performed for each primary species , energy and zenith angle , for all stations between @xmath26 from the core .",
    "it is important to point out that the asymmetry factor is different for different primaries , as one expects due to the greater number of muons in showers initiated by heavy nuclei than in showers initiated by protons .",

    "+ we focussed our analysis on the study of the azimuthal asymmetry of both the `` rise - time '' and `` fall - time '' that are sensitive to the presence of the electromagnetic and muonic components of the shower and , because of this to primary composition . from a study of the dependence of the azimuthal asymmetries in these timing variables with the depth in the atmosphere using monte carlo simulations for proton and iron showers in different energy ranges ,",
    "we have found a new observable for primary mass discrimination : a clear peak appears in the distribution of the asymmetry factor with atmospheric depth , the position of which is sensitive to primary mass . with a high statistics sample of inclined showers we expect to be able to obtain information on the primary composition with good precision using the method described in this work .",
    "an important feature of this study is the weak dependence of the new observable with energy , requiring only the knowledge of the core position with good resolution .",
