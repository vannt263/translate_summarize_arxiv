    "if a @xmath1-dimensional superconducting sample with ginzburg  landau parameter @xmath0 is submitted to a uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath2 , then ( by a theorem of giorgi and phillips  @xcite ) there exists a field strength @xmath3 such that if @xmath4 , then the sample will be in its normal state , i.e. superconductivity is lost altogether .",
    "it is at first sight natural to expect this phenomenon to mark a monotone transition , i.e. to expect that the material is in its superconducting ( possibly mixed ) state for all @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , such a monotonicity result has been proved recently in a number of geometric situations and in both @xmath1 and @xmath6 dimensional settings  @xcite in the case where the ginzburg ",
    "landau parameter @xmath0 is large ( it also follows from asymptotic expansions obtained in other works such as @xcite ) .",
    "however , nature does not support this monotonicity in general .",
    "the famous little  parks effect  @xcite shows that for narrow cylinders ( or @xmath1d annuli ) one has an oscillatory behavior instead of monotonicity .",
    "in this paper we will establish such ` oscillatory ' effects rigorously in different geometric settings .",
    "the lack of monotonicity comes from the topology / geometry of the annulus .",
    "it is natural to ask whether one can get such an oscillatory effect for ( non - vanishing ) magnetic fields defined on domains without topology . from the previous investigations",
    "@xcite we know this to be impossible for a uniform magnetic field , but how about more general fields ?",
    "the analysis of constant magnetic fields tells us that this question is linked to a purely spectral problem , namely whether the first eigenvalue of the schrdinger operator @xmath7 is monotone increasing in the parameter ( strength of the magnetic field ) @xmath8 for sufficiently large values of @xmath8 .",
    "this property has been called ` strong diamagnetism ' and has been proved for large classes of magnetic fields  it is even ` generically ' satisfied @xcite",
    ". however , we produce counterexamples in the general case .",
    "the ginzburg  landau theory of superconductivity is based on the energy functional @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a material parameter ( the ginzburg ",
    "landau parameter ) , @xmath11 is a parameter measuring the intensity of the external magnetic field .",
    "the domain @xmath12 is the part of space occupied by the superconducting material . for @xmath13",
    "there are two natural choices .",
    "one can take @xmath14 .",
    "that will not be our choice here because for reasons of simplicity we want to avoid an unnecessary technical complication connected with unbounded domains in @xmath15 ( for details on how to handle this issue see @xcite ) .",
    "one can also  and that will be our convention here ",
    "take @xmath13 to be the smallest simply connected domain containing @xmath16 , i.e. the union of @xmath16 and all the ` holes ' in @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 is the profile of the external magnetic field .    in the setting of bounded @xmath18 the functional @xmath19",
    "is naturally defined on @xmath20 .",
    "the functional is immediately seen to be gauge invariant , @xmath21 . the vector field @xmath22 models the induced magnetic vector potential .",
    "the function @xmath23 measures the superconducting properties of the material , with @xmath24 being a measure of the local density of cooper pairs .",
    "we say that a minimizer @xmath25 of the ginzburg ",
    "landau functional is trivial if @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in each of the situations we will encounter",
    ", the notation @xmath28 will be reserved for a fixed choice of vector potential with @xmath29 . for trivial minimizers",
    "we clearly have @xmath30 . for a nontrivial minimizer",
    "the functional must be negative , since one gets from the euler - lagrange equations of a minimizer that @xmath31 if @xmath25 is a minimizer .",
    "we define the set @xmath32 following @xcite one typically defines the third critical field to be given by @xmath33 , which is finite by @xcite .",
    "however , unless @xmath34 is an interval , this definition is not the only natural one to take  see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "we will see below that this is not always the case .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the annulus with inner radius @xmath36 and outer radius @xmath37 , let @xmath38 .",
    "in this case we will write @xmath39 i.e. the disc of radius @xmath37 .",
    "[ thm : main3 ] there exists an annulus @xmath16 and a @xmath40 such the set @xmath41 is not an interval .",
    "the mechanism behind this result is a convergence of the magnetic quadratic form on the annulus to the corresponding form on the circle .",
    "this convergence was already noticed in the works @xcite , where also ` annuli ' of non - uniform width were considered .",
    "it is likely that one could deduce theorem  [ thm : main3 ] from these works , however , we prefer to give a simple independent proof which also emphasizes the connection to the bohm  aharonov - effect .",
    "[ rem : largerkappa ] by shrinking the inner radius @xmath36 of the annulus , we can get @xmath42 as large as we want , since the eigenvalues of the limiting problem will then cross at a level @xmath43 .",
    "in particular it is possible to have @xmath44 , which means that theorem  [ thm : main3 ] also applies to superconductors of type ii .",
    "one may criticize the result of theorem  [ thm : main3 ] on two accounts .",
    "one could desire not to have the topology fixed a priori , but rather have it generated by localization properties of the minimizer .",
    "also most previous mathematical analysis has considered the limit of large values of @xmath0 .",
    "one can show that for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 the set @xmath34 of a superconducting sample in the shape of an annulus will behave as the one of the disc with the same outer radius , and it is known that for the disc and with constant magnetic field  for sufficiently large values of @xmath0@xmath34 is indeed an interval @xcite .",

    "in fact , the magnetic field can be chosen as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is some sufficiently small constant .",
