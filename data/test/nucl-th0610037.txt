    "we review briefly the theoretical models adopted in our calculations , i.e. , the bhf approach , and the chiral model for kaon - nucleon interaction . in sect.3",

    "our numerical results are presented in sect.4 .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sect.5 .",
    "in the present work , we employ the brueckner approach for asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite to calculate the baryonic contribution to the eos of the stellar matter .",
    "the starting point of the bhf approach is the interaction @xmath4 matrix which satisfies the brueckner - bethe - goldstone ( bbg ) equation@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the starting energy , and @xmath7 is the proton fraction , being @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the proton and the total baryon density , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the pauli operator , which prevents the two intermediate nucleons from being scattered into the states below the fermi sea , and @xmath11 is the single particle energy given by @xmath12 .",
    "the single particle potential @xmath13 is calculated from the real part of the on - shell @xmath4-matrix and we adopt for it the so called @xmath14  @xcite , i.e. for any momentum @xmath15 below and above the fermi surface    @xmath16|k k'\\rangle_a , \\label{eq : uk}\\ ] ]    where the subscript `` _ a _ '' indicates antisymmetrization of the matrix element . due to the occurrence of @xmath13 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bg ] ) and ( [ eq : uk ] ) , the latter constitute a coupled system of equations that has to be solved in a self - consistent way . in the bhf approximation",
    "the energy per nucleon is @xmath17|k k'\\rangle_a.\\ ] ] adopting the continuous choice for the single - particle potential , the two hole - line ( bhf ) truncation of the energy shift turns out to be a good approximation for the nuclear eos , since the results in this scheme are quite close to those obtained by including also the three hole - line contribution  @xcite .",
    "the basic input of the bbg equation is the realistic baryon - baryon interaction , which is determined by reproducing the nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts .",
    "the realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction @xmath18 adopted in the present calculation is the argonne @xmath19 two - body force  @xcite .        since nonrelativistic calculations , based on purely two - body interactions ,",
    "fail to reproduce the correct saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter , three - body forces ( tbfs ) among nucleons are usually introduced @xcite .",
    "they turn out to be needed to correct this deficiency . in this work",
    "two models have been used , i.e. , the phenomenological urbana model  @xcite , and a microscopic tbf constructed from the meson - exchange current approach  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the bbg approach is applicable only if the tbf is reduced to an effective two body force , which has to be added to the bare two body interaction .",
    "this is done by averaging over the position of the third particle , assuming that the probability of having two particles at a given distance is given by the two - body correlation function .",
    "the resulting potential is a density dependent two - body force  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the microscopic tbf in the calculation for asymmetric nuclear matter has been performed in ref .",

    "the solid lines represent the values obtained using the urbana phenomenological tbf , whereas the dashed lines are the values obtained by adopting the microscopic tbf .",
    "we notice that the results of the two adopted tbfs show a similar behavior up to density @xmath20 , but they differ a lot in the high density range . in particular , the microscopic tbf turns out to be more repulsive than the urbana model at high densities , and the discrepancy between the two predictions becomes increasingly large as the density increases .",
    "nucleonic tbfs play an essential role in determining the chemical composition of a neutron star .",
    "in fact , as shown below , the baryon chemical potentials and the symmetry energy strongly depend on the choice of tbfs , for densities typical of those encountered in the neutron star cores .",
    "the proton and neutron chemical potentials can be derived from the energy density through the standard thermodynamic relation @xmath21 with all remaining densities @xmath22 fixed .",

    ", we show the symmetry energy calculated in the bhf approach as a function of the nucleon density .",
    "its value at the normal nuclear matter density has been well determined to be @xmath29 mev .",
    "actually , the calculations performed with either the urbana phenomenological tbf ( solid line ) or the microscopic tbf ( dashed line ) reproduce correctly this value . however , the high density behavior suffers a large uncertainty , and this reflects in the theoretical predictions of the neutron star composition .",
    "moreover , we see that the symmetry energy predicted by using the microscopic tbf rises much faster at high densities than the one obtained by adopting the phenomenological tbf .",
    "as far as leptons are concerning , the energies and chemical potentials are obtained by solving the free fermi gas model at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "once the baryonic and leptonic chemical potentials are known , one can proceed to calculate the composition of the @xmath0-stable stellar matter , and then the total energy per particle @xmath30 and pressure @xmath31 through the usual thermodynamical relation @xmath32      in the present paper , we use the effective chiral theory proposed by kaplan and nelson  @xcite and extensively investigated afterwards  @xcite . in this model ,",

    "we adopt @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev , as determined from the baryon mass splittings  @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath39 and the bare kaon mass are related by the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath43 .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 had remained largely uncertain for many years , due to our poor knowledge of the strangeness content of the proton and the kaon - nucleon sigma term @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the large ambiguity in this parameter has been settled recently by dong , laga and liu  @xcite with small error based on the lattice calculations . in the present calculations we adopt values of @xmath44 equal to @xmath46 , as done in refs.@xcite , in order to investigate the sensitivity of our results to the variation of the proton strangeness content .",
    "our adopted central value @xmath47 mev is very close to the value extracted from the lattice gauge calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is @xmath48 mev with error of less than @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is essential in determining the onset density for kaon condensation , since it provides the attractive component of the kaon - nucleon interaction .    in principle",
    ", the chiral lagrangian should give the eos of baryons and mesons , but so far only the kaon - nucleon interaction has been extracted from it .",
    "therefore , we use the chiral lagrangian only to extract the kaon - nucleon part of the interactions , and take the eos for nuclear matter from the brueckner many - body theory .",
    "this means that the energy density is a sum of three contributions : the kaon - nucleon interaction energy density ( derived from @xmath50 ) , the nucleon - nucleon energy density , and the energy density for leptons ( @xmath51 ) : @xmath52 from eq.([etot ] ) , we get the nucleon - nucleon contribution as @xmath53 whereas the energy density for leptons is the one for a free fermi gas at zero temperature , and can be found in textbooks @xcite .",
    "following exactly the standard prescription in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can get the kaon - nucleon energy density of the kaon condensed matter from applying the baym theorem  @xcite , i.e. @xmath54 where @xmath9 and @xmath25 denote the nucleon number density and the proton fraction , respectively , and @xmath55 is the amplitude of the condensation .",
    "we remind the reader that in this work we neglect the effects of @xmath56 condensation , which could play a significant role at the high densities typical of neutron star cores , as it has been shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "for stars in which the strongly interacting particles are only baryons , the chemical composition is determined by the requirements of charge neutrality and equilibrium under the weak processes    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are baryons , @xmath60 denotes a lepton , either an electron or a muon , and @xmath61(@xmath62 ) a ( anti-)neutrino . under the condition of neutrino",
    "escape , these two requirements imply that the relations @xmath63 @xmath64 are satisfied . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath65 represents the baryon fraction for the species @xmath66 , and @xmath67 the baryon density .",
    "the neutron chemical potential is denoted by @xmath68 , whereas @xmath69 refers to the chemical potential of the baryon species @xmath66 , @xmath70 to its baryon number and @xmath71 to its electric charge .",
    "the same notation holds true for those quantities with subscript @xmath60 , i.e. leptons . under condition",
    "when the neutrinos are trapped in the system , the beta equilibrium condition ( [ mufre : eps ] ) is altered to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the chemical potential of the neutrino @xmath74 .",
    "because of the trapping , the numbers of leptons per baryon of each flavor of neutrino @xmath75 , @xmath76 are conserved on dynamical time scales .",
    "gravitational collapse calculations of the white - dwarf core of massive stars indicate that at the onset of trapping , the electron lepton number @xmath77 , the precise value depending on the efficiency of electron capture reactions during the initial collapse stage .",
    "also , because no muons are present when neutrinos become trapped , the constraint @xmath78 can be imposed .",
    "we fix @xmath79 at these values in our calculations for neutrino trapped matter .        .",
    "in the upper ( lower ) panels results are displayed for the case when the phenomenological urbana ( microscopic ) tbf is used . ]    in the neutron star matter with kaons the chemical equilibrium can be reached through the following reactions @xmath80 where @xmath60 denotes leptons , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "one can determine the ground state by minimizing the total energy density with respect to the condensate amplitude @xmath55 keeping all densities fixed .",

    "in fig .  [ f : comp ] we present the composition of the @xmath0-equilibrated neutrino - free ( left - hand panels ) and neutrino - trapped @xmath94 matter ( right - hand panels ) .",
    "the upper panels display results obtained using the argonne @xmath19 two - body potential supplemented by the phenomenological urbana tbf , whereas in the lower panels we show the populations obtained when the microscopic tbfs are used . in the neutrino - free case ,",
    "we notice that a stiffer symmetry energy produces a larger proton concentration in the region @xmath95 , where the proton fraction @xmath96 . in neutrino - trapped matter",
    ", the lepton concentration becomes sizeably higher because the electron chemical potential must keep at a high value , in order to fulfill the @xmath0-equilibrium condition .",
    "this leads to a larger proton fraction as compared to the neutrino - free case , because of the charge neutrality .",
    "therefore , neutrino - trapped matter is more symmetric than the neutrino - free one .",
    "we also notice that the differences in proton populations , due to the different tbfs adopted , are smoothed out when neutrinos are trapped .",
    "this is readily understood as follows . in neutrino - free matter",
    ", the electron chemical potential is determined mainly by the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "when neutrinos are trapped , they contribute to the chemical equilibrium , and , as a consequence , the electron chemical potential is determined simultaneously by the neutrino trapping effect and by the symmetry energy . because of the lepton number conservation , the major effect of trapping is to keep the electron concentration high , and this reduces considerably the role played by the symmetry energy in determining the star composition .",
    "let us now discuss the case when kaons are present in @xmath0 stable and neutrally charged matter . in fig .",
    "[ f : compk ] we show the particle fractions for neutrino free star matter , using alternatively the phenomenological urbana tbf ( upper panels ) and the microscopic one ( lower panels ) .",
    "we have chosen three different values of the parameter @xmath44 , respectively @xmath97 .",
    "we observe that the kaon threshold depends sensitively on the attraction term of the kaon - nucleon interaction . in the extreme case of @xmath98 mev ,",
    "the predicted kaon onset density is the lowest , of the order of @xmath99 , almost independently on the adopted nucleonic tbf .",
    "this is due to the fact that , up to densities of the order of @xmath100 , both kinds of tbf produce a very similar symmetry energy .",
    "in addition , the role played by the kaon - nucleon interaction becomes more predominant over that by the symmetry energy for a stronger kaon - nucleon interaction term . for larger densities",
    ", the microscopic tbf gives a higher symmetry energy , and this leads to a slightly different kaon threshold when a weak attractive term is adopted .",
    "we also notice a dramatic decrease of the lepton population and increase of the proton concentration as a consequence of the kaon appearance .",
    "this is due to the charge neutrality condition , which has to be always fulfilled .",
    "we notice that the threshold densities for kaon condensation may be delayed by the onset of hyperons , as found by other authors @xcite .    in fig.[f :",
    "compk_nu ] the particle population is plotted as a function of the baryon density for the neutrino trapped case .",
    "we notice that , because of trapped neutrinos , the onset of kaon condensation is shifted to larger densities than in neutrino free matter . even in that case , both tbf s produce very similar results , except for the less attractive case , i.e. @xmath101 , where the onset for kaon condensation takes place at a lower density for the microscopic tbf .",
    "this is due to the fact that , at high density , the symmetry energy is larger , and this allows for a kaon condensed phase at baryon density lower than in the case with the urbana tbf . as compared to the neutrino free case , the kaon abundance in the condensed phase is much smaller than in neutrino trapped matter , due to the larger electron population .",
    "in contrast to the normal phase , in the condensed phase the number of neutrinos rises up as the baryon density increases , and this is because the presence of kaons leads to a decrease of the electron population as a function of the baryon density .",
    "we notice that the values of the threshold densities for @xmath102 condensation both in neutrino - free and neutrino - trapped matter are in very good agreement with those found in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the threshold densities are dependent both on the value of the temperature , and the attraction term of the kaon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "once the relative particle concentrations are known , we can calculate the equation of state .",
    "this is shown in fig.[f : press_nu ] , both for the neutrino free case ( upper panels ) , and the neutrino trapped one ( lower panels ) . in the case without kaons , the equation of state of neutrino trapped matter is slightly softer than the neutrino free one , because the loss in energy due to the reduction of the neutron - proton asymmetry as a consequence of the increase of the proton abundance exceeds the gain from the presence of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the kaon condensation produces a general softening of the equation of state with respect to the purely nucleonic case .",
    "the degree of softening depends on the value of the parameter @xmath44 , i.e. , the larger the value of @xmath103 the stronger the softening is . in the case with kaon condensate ,",
    "neutrino trapping produces a stiffer equation of state due to the higher onset density of kaons and smaller kaon abundance , as shown in fig.[f : compk_nu ] .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the softening of the equation of state due to kaon condensate is much less pronounced in neutrino trapped matter than in neutrino free matter .",
    "this may lead a newly - formed , hot protoneutron star to metastability , i.e. a delayed collapse while cooling down , as discussed in ref.@xcite .        in some cases , the onset of a kaon condensed phase produces a negative compressibility in the equation of state . following migdal @xcite ,",
    "we have performed a maxwell construction to maintain a positive compressibility .",
    "we should note that the maxwell construction is valid for substances with only one independent component .",
    "neutron star matter has two independent components ( the baryon and electric charge ) .",
    "therefore , the maxwell construction can not satisfy gibbs criteria that pressure , temperature and all chemical potentials be common to both phases in equilibrium .",
    "a novel treatment of the phase transition in @xmath0 stable matter has been proposed by glendenning@xcite for the hadron - quark phase transition , and has been subsequently extended to the study of the kaon condensed phase , treated as a first order phase transition in neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "the gibbs construction has strong consequences on the mechanical stability of neutron stars , because the pressure is a monotonically increasing function of the density . on the contrary",
    ", there is a mechanical instability for the maxwell case that is initiated by the central densities for which the pressure remains constant .",
    "such an unstable region is absent when the phase transition is treated using gibbs conditions .",
    "it turns out that the value of the maximum mass of neutron stars with kaon condensation is only slightly affected by the gibbs construction@xcite , which is still affected by many theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "therefore we limit ourselves to the maxwell construction . in fig.5 , the region of constant pressure ( thin solid line )",
    "is comprised between two values of the baryon density , denoted by @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "if the magnitude of @xmath103 is large , it may happen that @xmath106 . as a rule",
    ", we consider this solution as unrealistic , and we do not show the corresponding curve in fig.[f : press_nu ] .",
    "this is the case when @xmath107 and neutrinos are trapped , that is to say that the kaon condensation requires a very stiff symmetry energy if the kaon - nucleon interaction is strongly attractive .",
    "once the eos has been determined , the tov equations can be solved .",
    "the resulting gravitational mass is plotted for neutrino free matter in fig.[f : mass_rho_free ] , as a function of both radius and central density , normalized with respect to the saturation value . in particular ,",
    "microscopic tbf s produce stiffer equations of state , and therefore give rise to larger values of the maximum mass .",
    "we observe a decrease of the maximum mass when kaons appear , the exact value being dependent on the chosen tbf s and the parameter @xmath44 . in the microscopic case ,",
    "the inclusion of kaons decreases the maximum mass configuration down to about 2 @xmath108 . on the other hand , phenomenological tbf s",
    "produce softer equations of state and , consequently , smaller neutron stars , whose maximum mass is about 1.7 @xmath108 . in fig.[f : mass_rho_free ] circles represent unstable configurations , originating from the maxwell construction .",
    "those configurations turn out to be stable if the gibbs construction @xcite is applied to the transition from purely nuclear matter to the kaon condensed phase .        in the purely nucleonic case ,",
    "neutrino trapping generally produces a softer equation of state , because beta - stable matter turns out to be more symmetric in neutrons and protons . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum mass becomes smaller .",
    "this is displayed in fig.[f : mass_rho_trap ] .",
    "however , the appearance of kaons changes this general picture and the equation of state becomes stiffer .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath102 onset depends on the lepton chemical potential , i.e. , @xmath109 , which stays at larger values in neutrino - trapped matter than in the neutrino - free case , thus delaying the appearance of @xmath102 to higher baryon density .",
    "the resulting maximum mass increases , as shown in fig.[f : mass_rho_trap ] .",
    "if phenomenological tbf s are used , the value of the maximum mass stabilizes around 1.8 @xmath108 , whereas microscopic tbf s give rise to protoneutron stars with mass slightly larger than 2 @xmath108 .",
    "as compared to the neutrino free case ( fig.[f : mass_rho_free ] ) , the reduction of the maximum mass due to the presence of kaons is smaller in the neutrino trapped case .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the properties of kaon condensed neutrino - free and neutrino - trapped matter at zero temperature including the composition , the equation of state , and the radius - mass relation , in the framework of the bhf approach with both microscopic and phenomenological three - body forces .",
    "in particular , we have discussed the interplay among the effects of the different tbfs , kaon condensate , and neutrino trapping .",
    "it is found that the effect of the microscopic tbf results in larger values of symmetry energy at high densities ( @xmath110 ) than that of the phenomenological one .",
    "this gives rise to a higher proton population in ns matter without neutrinos and kaons , thus allowing for fast cooling through the direct urca process .",
    "the contribution of trapped neutrinos makes the electron concentration keep high in @xmath0-equilibrated star matter and weakens the role played by the symmetry energy on the predicted composition of the star . as a result",
    ", the composition of the star matter becomes less sensitive to the two different three - body forces considered when neutrinos are trapped . in the star matter without kaons ,",
    "neutrino trapping leads to a softening of the equation of state .",
    "however when kaons are allowed , neutrino trapping makes the equation of state stiffer as compared to the neutrino free star matter , since the presence of trapped neutrinos shifts the onset of kaons to higher densities and reduces the kaon abundance .    in both cases with and without kaons ,",
    "the microscopic tbf leads to larger values of the maximum star masses than the phenomenological one .",
    "if only nucleons and leptons are allowed , the effect of neutrino trapping is to reduce the maximum star mass ; while when kaons are allowed , trapping instead produces larger stars .",
    "as expected , the effect of kaon condensate is generally to soften the equation of state and reduce the predicted maximum star mass .",
    "neutrino trapping weakens the role of kaons by delaying their onset densities to higher values and by reducing the kaon abundance . as a result ,",
    "the reduction of the maximum mass due to kaon condensate is less in the neutrino trapped case than in the neutrino free case .",
    "this general scenario could change if we include hyperons in our calculations .",
    "several studies have been performed on hyperonic matter within the bhf approach @xcite , showing that @xmath111 appear already at a very low value of the baryon density , i.e. , @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , hyperon onset might be a process in competition with kaon condensation @xcite , as found in relativistic mean - field approaches @xcite .",
    "we will present a more detailed study in a forthcoming publication .",

    "<S> we investigate the composition and the equation of state of the kaon condensed phase in neutrino - free and neutrino - trapped star matter within the framework of the brueckner - hartree - fock approach with three - body forces . </S>",
    "<S> we find that neutrino trapping shifts the onset density of kaon condensation to a larger baryon density , and reduces considerably the kaon abundance . as a consequence , when kaons are allowed , the equation of state of neutrino - trapped star matter becomes stiffer than the one of neutrino free matter . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of different three - body forces are compared and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino trapping turns out to weaken the role played by the symmetry energy in determining the composition of stellar matter , and thus reduces the difference between the results obtained by using different three - body forces . </S>"
