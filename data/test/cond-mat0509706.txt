    "the mott  @xcite and the anderson  @xcite routes to localization have long been recognized as two of the basic processes that can drive the metal - insulator transition .",
    "theories separately describing each of these mechanisms were discussed long ago . according to the scaling theory of localization ,  @xcite for example , any amount of disorder drives a system with dimension smaller or equal to two to an insulator phase . however , this result was derived considering anderson localization effects due to disorder , in the absence of electron - electron interaction .",
    "several years after the scaling theory of localization ,  @xcite the groundbreaking work of finkelstein  @xcite suggested for the first time the existence of a possible metallic phase in two dimensions for disordered correlated systems . in ref .",
    ", the effects of correlation and disorder were included by a perturbative renormalization group approach based on the fermi liquid theory .",
    "these results are valid in the diffusive regime .",
    "behavior in the ballistic regime was later considered by gold and dolgopolov ,  @xcite by das sarma and hwang , @xcite and by zala _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite most recently , punnoose and finkelstein  @xcite have extended the latter s earlier work  @xcite to give a description of metallic behavior in two - dimensional semiconductor structures . however , all these works focus on corrections to the fermi liquid theory and as such are appropriate in the weak coupling regime .",
    "@xcite such perturbative approaches can not properly describe strong correlation effects , such as the approach to the mott transition , or the associated transmutation of conduction electrons into local magnetic moments .",
    "these processes are of key importance in many materials of recent interest , ranging from doped transition metal oxides and doped semiconductors to organic mott systems .    to describe systems in which both the correlations and the disorder effects are strong , complementary methods are required .",
    "this is the situation we examine in the present paper , where we focus on extensions of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite these extensions are local mean field approaches , which certainly can not provide a proper description of fluctuation effects in low dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , they can be considered as the simplest approaches incorporating both the mott and the anderson routes to localization .",
    "even simple estimates indicate that in many systems both of these processes play comparable roles , and as a result they can not be considered separately . addressing",
    "the behavior in this nonperturbative regime is the main subject of this work .    in the following , we first briefly review the principal physical ideas on the interplay of correlations and disorder , as already presented in the early works of mott .",
    "@xcite we then discuss how this physical behavior is naturally described by the extended dmft approaches which are the main subject of this paper .",
    "@xcite      fig1.eps    a first glimpse of the basic effect of disorder on the mott transition was outlined by mott ,  @xcite who pointed out that important consequences of disorder can be seen even when the correlations are so strong that the system is in the strongly localized ( atomic ) limit . in the absence of disorder , each site has two energy levels , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the on - site interaction potential . if the system is half - filled , then each site is singly occupied ; the levels @xmath9 remain empty",
    ". we have one local magnetic moment at each site , and a gap equal to @xmath8 to charge excitations ( as schematically represented in fig .  [ fig01 ] on the right ) .",
    "when disorder is added , each of these energy levels is shifted by a randomly fluctuating site energy @xmath10 .",
    "the situation remains unchanged for @xmath11 , as all the levels @xmath12 remain empty ( for half - filling the chemical potential is @xmath13 ) . for larger disorder ,",
    "those sites with @xmath14 have the level @xmath15 and are empty .",
    "similarly , those sites with @xmath16 have the excited level @xmath17 and are doubly occupied .",
    "thus for @xmath18 a fraction of the sites are either doubly occupied or empty . the mott gap is now closed , although a fraction of the sites still remain as localized magnetic moments .",
    "we can describe this state as an inhomogeneous mixture of a mott and an anderson insulator ( as shown in the center of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "however , the empty and doubly occupied sites have succeeded to completely fill the gap in the average single particle density - of - states ( dos ) .",
    "this physical picture of mott is very transparent and intuitive .",
    "the nontrivial question is how the strongly localized ( atomic ) limit is approached as one crosses the metal - insulator transition from the metallic side . to address this question one needs a more detailed theory for the metal - insulator transition region , which was not available when the questions posed by mott and anderson were put forward .",
    "the early ideas of mott have been elaborated and put on a considerably firmer ground by the development of dmft approaches .",
    "here,@xcite the many - body problem is reduced to focusing on a single site in the lattice and solving for the dynamics of an electron trying to delocalize by escaping into its environment .",
    "the solution of such an anderson impurity problem depends very strongly on the spectrum of electronic states @xmath19 describing the environment , a quantity determined by an appropriate self - consistency condition defined by the lattice model in question.@xcite in the presence of disorder , we have an _ ensemble _ of single - impurity problems and the self - consistency condition involves the algebraic average of local quantities over the ensemble .",
    "this theory provides the currently best available description of the mott metal - insulator transition , but standard dmft fails to incorporate anderson localization effects .",
    "+   + _ localization effects within dmft : statdmft _   + to overcome this difficulty , in a recent work  @xcite dmft was extended by allowing for spatial fluctuations of the cavity spectrum , now given by @xmath20 ( note the index  @xmath21 ) .",
    "this led to the so - called _ _",
    "stat__dmft approach , which followed the original method of anderson .",
    "@xcite here , one takes the local point of view , but looks at the typical values of the quantities , that is , to their most probable values .",
    "in particular , one can examine the typical escape rate , which is given by the typical dos available to escape from a given lattice site .",
    "these accessible levels are typically found away from the fermi energy , reducing the relevant spectral weight `` seen '' by the local electron .",
    "stat__dmft approach is intuitively appealing and physically well - justified ; its limitation is the extensive numerical work required to solve the associated stochastic equations .",
    "+ _ typical medium theory _   + an alternative and much simpler approach was recently provided by the typical medium theory ( tmt ) ,  @xcite in which the local spectrum of the effective medium is replaced by its geometric ( typical ) average .",
    "this approach proved able to reproduce many expected features of the anderson localization transition for dimension larger than @xmath22 .",
    "it can be viewed as the conceptually simplest local picture of the anderson localization . in this approximation ,",
    "the spectral weight of the cavity is reduced as the anderson transition is approached .    even before doing any calculations",
    ", one may anticipate that such an elementary manifestation of incipient localization should dramatically affect the correlation effects when the electron - electron interaction is turned on .",
    "very recent work by byczuk _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite followed a tmt approach and confirmed that ( in contrast to standard dmft ) it provides a consistent description of both mott and anderson transition in the limiting cases and also of the mott - anderson transition when both interaction and disorder are present .",
    "a phase diagram obtained by employing a numerical renormalization group impurity solver was presented . however",
    ", a more detailed understanding of the physical behavior in the critical regime , such as possible scaling properties and power - law behavior , was not elucidated .    to have a better understanding of what is going on , we use a `` 4-boson '' impurity solver ( in the following call it sb4 ) of kotliar and ruckenstein  @xcite to examine the critical behavior at the mott - anderson transition . before having a complete description of this critical behavior ,",
    "it is important to first understand in detail the critical behavior of the local impurity models , and this is what we concentrate on in this paper .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion of the atomic limit , as well as from the previous _ _ stat__dmft results ,  @xcite that for @xmath18 the mott - anderson transition has a qualitatively different character than either the pure mott or anderson transitions .",
    "one has to deal with a two - fluid situation , as a fraction of the electrons become local magnetic moments and the other fraction remains in magnetically inert configurations .    in this paper",
    ", we explore this two - fluid picture from the point of view of single - impurity problems with different on - site energies . instead of addressing the structure of the self - consistent solution",
    ", we examine a simpler problem , where we use a simple model to describe the behavior of the cavity spectrum .",
    "more specifically , we look at the behavior of a collection of anderson impurity models , defined by the local site energies @xmath0 as , guided by the tmt results ,  @xcite we reduce the spectral weight of the bath function . the latter is a measure of the distance @xmath4 to the transition and we thus mimic the approach to it .",
    "we find that when the distance @xmath4 to the transition decreases , depending on the value of the impurity on - site energy @xmath0 , the quasiparticle weight @xmath23 goes either to @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "we explore in detail the scaling behavior of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath0 , which can be expressed in an elegant form using an appropriate @xmath26-function formulation , as described below .",
    "we anticipate that our detailed understanding of this scaling behavior will allow for an analytical solution of the critical behavior within the full self - consistent theory .",
    "this interesting direction is left for future work .",
    "note , though , that the analysis presented in this paper describes properties of quantum impurities in a metallic host and is therefore relevant for that class of problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the single - impurity models we solved and the method used to do it . in section iii , we discuss the @xmath26-function formulation valid for the problem in question .",
    "we finish by presenting our conclusions in section iv .",
    "in dmft language , a given site is seen as an anderson impurity that has the freedom to dynamically choose between a singlet or a doublet ( local moment ) solution upon entering the insulator .",
    "the relevant impurity model is characterized by the on - site repulsion @xmath8 , the on - site energy @xmath0 and the total spectral weight @xmath4 of the cavity field ( this is defined in terms of @xmath4 below ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the problem is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are annihilation operators of extended and localized electrons , respectively , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 define the cavity field @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "alternatively , the cavity function can be written in the spectral form @xmath33    we used two different forms for @xmath34 :    1 .",
    "the typical dos calculated self - consistently when approaching the mott - anderson transition.@xcite an example can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for @xmath35 and different values of the breadth of the disorder @xmath36 .",
    "we find that , as the transition is approached , the spectrum retains the same shape , while mainly the total spectral weight , determined here by the spectrum width , decreases [ see panel ( a)].@xcite besides , as shown in panel ( b ) , the results can be scaled to a single function , with the scaling parameter @xmath4 ( inset ) having a powerlaw dependence on @xmath36 .",
    "here @xmath4 is a measure of the spectrum width .",
    "2 .   a featureless model bath given by @xmath25 for @xmath37 and zero otherwise , with @xmath38 at the transition .    as we shall see , the qualitative critical behaviors of the impurity models are not affected by the specific choice of the spectral function , as identical critical exponents are obtained for the two models .",
    "this is important , since a simple featureless model offers a considerable advantage for analytical work .    the impurity model of eq .",
    "( [ 1imp ] ) was solved at zero temperature using the sb4 method ,  @xcite which provides a parametrization of the low - energy ( quasiparticle ) part of the local green s function , given by    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the local quasiparticle weight and @xmath41 is the renormalized site energy .",
    "the approach consists of determining the site - dependent parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 by the following equations @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48/ [ 1-(e_{i}^{2 } -d_{i}^{2})^{2}]$ ] in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "[ fig1 ] for the flat bath function explained above .",
    "almost identical results are found for the self consistent typical bath of fig .  [ fig0 ] .",
    "we shall examine the situation where the spectral weight @xmath4 goes to zero , meaning that the system goes towards the mott - anderson transition .",
    "fig4.ps    considering many single - impurity problems , we observe a two - fluid picture , just as in the limit earlier analyzed by mott .",
    "@xcite indeed , these results correspond to the same atomic limit discussed by mott , since , although the hopping itself is still finite , the cavity field `` seen '' by the impurities goes to zero in the current case .",
    "one can either look at the results as a function of @xmath53 for different values of @xmath4 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , or look at the same data plotted as a function of @xmath4 for different values of @xmath53 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .    as in the atomic limit",
    ", the sites with @xmath54 turn into local moments and have vanishing quasiparticle weight @xmath55 .",
    "the remaining sites show @xmath56 , as they are either doubly occupied , which corresponds to those with @xmath16 , or empty , which is the case for those sites with @xmath57 . consequently ,",
    "as the transition is approached , the curves @xmath58 `` diverge '' and approach either @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "these values of @xmath3 can thus be identified as two stable fixed points for the problem in question , as we discuss below .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we restrict the results to positive energy values , as a similar behavior is observed for negative @xmath53 . in this case , there is precisely one value of the site energy @xmath61 , for which @xmath62 .",
    "this corresponds to the value of @xmath0 below which @xmath3 `` flows '' to @xmath24 and above which @xmath3 `` flows '' to @xmath25 .",
    "in other words , it corresponds to an unstable fixed point .",
    "just as in the atomic limit , @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where @xmath35 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "interestingly , the family of curves in fig .  [ fig8 ] looks similar to those seen in some other examples of quantum critical phenomena .",
    "in fact , one can say that the crossover scale @xmath4 plays the role of the reduced temperature , and the reduced site energy @xmath67 that of the control parameter of the quantum critical point .",
    "as the site energy is tuned at @xmath68 , the impurity model undergoes a phase transition from a singlet to a doublet ground state .",
    "quantum fluctuations associated with the metallic host introduce a cutoff and round this phase transition , which becomes sharp only in the @xmath38 limit . in the following ,",
    "we develop a detailed scaling analysis of the @xmath68 , @xmath69 fixed point based on our numerical and analytical results obtained from the sb4 impurity model solution .",
    "our numerical solutions provide evidence that as a function of @xmath4 the `` charge '' @xmath70 `` flows '' away from the unstable `` fixed point '' @xmath71 , and towards either stable `` fixed points '' @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
