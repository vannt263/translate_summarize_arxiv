    "in spite of quantum mechanics has demonstrated the amazing power to describe micro - phenomena , its behavior is so different from macro - intuitions that attempts to recover ( quasi- ) deterministic movement of particles never give up.@xcite however , due to non - local correlation of quantum states , these attempts all suffer quite difficulties to achieve self - consistent results and received a despaired strike by aspect s experiments@xcite on epr correlations.@xcite many evidences have revealed that non - locality ( or entanglement ) is a fundamental property of quantum process , and to restore the motion of particles back to deterministic manner is in fact impossible .",
    "nevertheless , one may ask a further question : is such kind of non - local correlation globally ( i.e. , simultaneously around the whole space ) correlated or partially localized ? from a point of view of standard non - relativistic quantum mechanics , since wave function is defined on the whole space , as well as all operators , the theory must be globally correlated . in terms of feynman",

    ". here path integral @xmath1\\mathcal{d}[p(t)]$ ] means to sum over the whole coordinate and momentum spaces along time - sliced paths with fixed end points at @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see chapter 1 of ref .   for details ) .",
    "thus one may wonder how can we separate an atomic ( quantum ) system from the universe and treat it isolatedly as we did heaps of times before ? a consistent theory should explain why to ignore effects due to supernova explosions or other processes occurring at somewhere in the cosmos is reasonable .",
    "it is difficult within the framework of standard quantum mechanics within the framework of path integral formalism , one may would like to employ the stationary phase condition to argue that contributions from those paths with large deviation from classical one s canceled completely and results in required isolation conditions . but notice ( a ) this is only true for quasi - classical approximations ; ( b ) obviously different paths would have different variations of the contribution due to changes of the dynamic environment along each course , there is no guarantee that all of these variations with time can be completely and simultaneously canceled all the time . in a sense of that ,",
    "we reach a point that some paths in eq.([eq : fpi ] ) should be forbidden in a self - consistent quantum theory in order to satisfy the isolation hypothesis and to remove instantaneous correlations .",
    "actually , it will be seen in this paper that to generalize the feynman s formalism slightly to covariant relativistic case will produce partial locality to quantum mechanics .",
    "this property is crucial to ensure that experiments on atomic system are really corresponding to the behavior of that system but not those relating to the external cosmos .",
    "it is necessary to point out that several attempts to set up a relativistic particle path integral have been proposed before , but they failed to produce the required isolation condition .",
    "the employed formalisms are rather unsatisfactory due to lack of explicit lorentz covariance and treated time and spatial coordinates on different footings.@xcite the physical implications associated with the derivations also are not clear enough .",
    "therefore these attempts are in fact a kind of mathematical techniques for conventional quantum mechanics , and can not be taken as the foundation for developing a new theory . in subsequent sections ,",

    "usually it is non - inertial .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that instantaneously one can employ an inertial frame to approximate it ( in terms of the general theory of relativity , the space - time manifold can be approximated by a series of minkowski spacetimes locally@xcite ) . in this way the movement of a particle can be described by a series of inertial frames , which relating to the observer by respective lorentz transformations",

    "this means that @xmath92 does not be defined around the whole space - time . to enlarge its definition domain to the whole space - time",

    "however , when @xmath101 , it will become correlated since the intersection of @xmath80 and @xmath81 usually non - empty in this case .",
    "it is quite clear that in this case the propagation of quantum correlation of measurements also has the same speed as light ( if the space - time coordinates of one measurement lies within the influence region of another measurement , then their results will be correlated , otherwise are independent ) .",
    "however , if paths in @xmath88 are involved , i.e. , with anti - particle excitations , the segments of a path with @xmath102 allow the path sweeping a larger time interval than actually happened from the point of an observer .",
    "this implies that the permitted spatial region in fig.[fig : cpi](b ) are broadened , which would lead to a superluminal propagation of influence region of measurements . at high energy limits where excited anti - particle can exist permanently , quantum correlation",

    "this novel mechanism for propagation of quantum correlation makes it possible to interpret the experiments on epr effect@xcite with a new point of view .",
    "a. aspect s experiments shows a contradiction between the reality and locality in a physical theory.@xcite however since there the locality is defined by the principle of maximum speed of light ( i.e. , the velocity of quantum correlation propagation is limited by @xmath103 ) , the propagation mechanism of perturbations arised from our formalism releases this definition and solve the contradiction automatically for massive matters . as long as energy",
    "does not approach infinite , the life - time of excited anti - particles must be finite , then we have a finite correlation speed and the required isolation condition for quantum mechanics .",
    "if we define this property as locality , which has the same spirit as the original one  to get rid of action at a distance from physical theory , then bell s inequality@xcite loses its availability to characterize the relationship of physical reality and locality because we do nt know exact information about anti - particle excitations , as well as the exact value of correction speed , despite it should larger than the velocity of light usually .",
    "we see that in this case we still have a possibility to preserve the reality and locality from epr s experiments . of course",
    "this also leaks a light of hope for hidden variable theories if they prefer to include anti - particle effects in their framework to reproduce superluminal mechanism , though i do not believe it could be a right choice for the truth .",
    "it is necessary to point out that in aspect s experiments , since correlation between photons are examined , which corresponding to a singular case in our formalism because photon is massless and its anti - particle is just itself , the predicted correlation velocity will approach infinite .",
    "this should be the only one case where action at a distance may be possible in our formalism and results in a maximum violation of bell s inequality . however , to eliminate this possibility is far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "regards this , we suggest to perform analogous experiments on massive particles to examine the effects of anti - particle excitations .",
    "using developed variational principle defined on world lines , we obtained the formal action for a relativistic system .",
    "it permits us to generalize the feynman s path integral formalism of quantum mechanics to special relativity case elegantly , which reproduces the klein - gordon and dirac equation for infinitesimal intervals very well .",
    "some novel understandings are obtained from this new point of view .",
    "though quantum state can be defined on the whole space - time , quantum processes are always localized at low energy limits , while large - scale correlations are due to anti - particles excitations , which makes superluminal corrections become possible even within the framework of special relativity . with this mechanism for correlation propagation ,",
    "quantum mechanics becomes more completeness and self - consistency .",
    "also it shows at the first time that we still have opportunity to save the concept of physical reality without lost the locality of a theory .",
    "sometimes this kind of correlation mechanism will bring a little inconvenience to calculation .",
    "for example , when considering a process described by a superposition state , one then need to check that if its sub - states are really correlated or not within studied time interval in order to give physical meaning to the final superimposed state . at",
