    "in 1936 bethe and bacher @xcite and in 1938 hafstad and teller @xcite predicted that alpha particle structures @xcite could be present in atomic nuclei .",
    "convincing arguments for existence of such structures were provided by systematics of the binding energies of the even - even nuclei with equal number of protons and neutrons ( see also @xcite ) , as well as by systematics of the binding energy of the additional neutron in nuclei like @xmath3b , @xmath4c and @xmath5o .",
    "the latter systematics could be explained by assuming that the valence neutron moves in a multi - center potential with centers identified with alpha particles . today",
    ", in a commonly accepted point of view one considers that alpha particle clusters can appear in the nuclear matter at subsaturation densities .",
    "such conditions are met e.g. at the nuclear surface where , in not too heavy nuclei , almost the whole nuclear mass is concentrated .",
    "subtle changes of the ground state energy of atomic nuclei as a function of nucleon number can be described by the shell model , which neglects correlations between nucleons .",
    "the main idea of the present approach is to verify whether these subtle changes , in case of @xmath6-alpha nuclei , could be attributed to the appearance of alpha - like clusters which modify the structure of the wave function and introduce strong correlations between nucleons .",
    "in such an approach the system in its ground state behaves like a crystal , with stationary configuration and shape and with definite distances between the wave function centers for a given nucleus .",
    "the subtle changes of the binding energy due to appearance of alpha - like clusters in the wave functions of @xmath6-alpha nuclei will be determined within an extended version of the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "it will be shown in the following that the hypothesis of alpha structures in the @xmath6-alpha nuclei can indeed describe the binding energy systematics of bethe @xcite .",
    "it will be also shown that the hypothesis of the alpha structures helps to understand the evolution of the root mean square ( rms ) radii and of the density profiles as a function of the number of alpha particles in the @xmath6-alpha nuclei .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the adopted interactions in the nuclear matter .",
    "section 3 presents constraints on the introduced parametrization resulting from the properties of light charged particles .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the ground state properties of @xmath6-alpha nuclei .",
    "first , it investigates the effects of clusterization on the ground state configurations .",
    "then , some corrections to the hamiltonian , related to the many body character of the nuclear interaction and to the bosonic nature of the wave function are introduced .",
    "it will be shown that the introduced corrections make the structural corrections stronger .",
    "finally , the model predictions for binding energies , rms radii and density profiles are presented and compared with the experimental values .",
    "section 5 contains conclusions .",
    "in order to predict correctly a state and evolution of a nuclear system a reliable description of the interaction between nucleons is needed . in case of a strong interaction",
    "it is not an easy task . as we know",
    "the fundamental theory governing the nucleon - nucleon interactions is the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , where interactions are calculated from the physics of quarks and gluons .",
    "unfortunately , very limited progress has been achieved in application of qcd for the description of interaction between quark - gluon clusters .",
    "therefore a phenomenological approach , associated to some specific conditions has been applied .",
    "since we are interested in the low - energy region in which nucleons are not excited internally , one can treat nucleons as quasi elementary particles .",
    "additionally , if we apply a non - relativistic approximation , the mutual nucleon interaction can be described by a respective potential . as can be found in the text books , details of the form of such a potential are deduced from nuclear interaction symmetries and mechanism of exchange of bosons .    for a final test of this type of a potential and the determination of its parameters",
    "one uses a comparison with the experimental data . here",
    "the nucleon - nucleon scattering data or light nuclei properties are usually used . a general conclusion from this kind of research",
    "is that a simple two body potential is not sufficient to describe the behavior of the system of more than two nucleons .",
    "one should add at least the three - body force .",
    "in particular , in the nuclear system , the three - body force is acceptable because the strong interaction is generated by the exchange process of gluons .",
    "the n - body interaction can be interpreted as coming from the multi - pion exchange processes .",
    "these considerations show the difficulties in the description of even the simplest nuclear system .",
    "the extension of the description of interaction by the three - body forces shows that the exchanged particles ( bosons ) play a significant role in the interaction process .    in order to describe dynamics of the system one has to express the change of energy associated with its evolution . in the description of energy through the potential one",
    "has to define its form .",
    "hence the wave function of a system of identical particles must be either symmetric or antisymmetric and it must be taken into account when defining the energy of the ground state . in case of the fermionic systems one should use antisymmetric wave function which is a serious difficulty in the description of the collision dynamics .",
    "some proposals to solve this problem are shown for instance in @xcite .",
    "other approaches , introducing some kinds of the momentum dependent pauli potentials and pauli - blocking schemes , which are meant to mimic the effects of antisymmetrization and are much less time consuming , are also proposed , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present approach , we propose a description in which particles are distinguishable and energy associated with the fermionic motion affects the resulting energy density which is parametrized and used instead of the potential .",
    "such a concept is present in the description of the liquid drop model ( ldm ) and in some density functional models , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that such an approach requires the knowledge of the local density of matter and the knowledge of the wave function describing the system . in the present description we use a standard one , commonly applied in such cases , i.e. the wave function",
    "is defined as a simple product of minimal wave packets ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the main argument for disregarding the antisymmetrization in the present approach is the form of the proposed eos which includes the spin and isospin terms .",
    "these terms force the unlike nucleons to form `` bosonic '' alpha - like clusters for which , presumably , the antisymmetrization may no longer play a decisive role .    each minimal wave packet in the adopted wave function has a defined spin and a specific charge for a selected quantization axis :    @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , are the width ( the position variance of the @xmath12-th nucleon ) of a gaussian wave packet and the mean position and mean momentum of each of the @xmath13 nucleons , respectively .",
    "every partial wave function is labeled by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , denoting the isospin and spin ( or precisely , their projections on a specified quantization axis ) associated with a given nucleon .",
    "variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath9 are , in general , time - dependent parameters describing the wave functions .    in the present approach",
    "the nuclear matter is treated as a four component fluid characterized by the respective densities :    @xmath18 - for protons with spin up ,    @xmath19 - for protons with spin down ,    @xmath20 - for neutrons with spin up ,    @xmath21 - for neutrons with spin down .",
    "density distributions in the system are uniquely determined by parameters of the wave function ( mean position , mean momentum and variance of the position of each nucleon ) .",
    "the description of the system evolution due to the time evolution of these parameters is , in general , defined by the dirac - frenkel time - dependent variational principle @xcite .",
    "this approach describes the interaction in a self - consistent way .    assuming that nucleons are moving inside the nuclear system , the average energy of the system is a sum of the average potential energy and of kinetic energy associated with the fermionic motion",
    "this is the case when one disregards the energy of the ordered motion , which for the low excitations of the system is considered later on as a correction ( see formula ( [ eq : ham ] ) ) .    according to the above idea",
    "we now present a method of determining the average energy associated with each nucleon . for the description of this average energy we assume the existence of a scalar field @xmath22 , determined by the local densities @xmath23 .",
    "if , for every @xmath24 nucleon , the corresponding wave packet @xmath25 determines the probability @xmath26 of finding a nucleon at a given point * @xmath27 * then it is assumed that the average energy @xmath28 associated with this nucleon is defined by the mean value and variance of the field @xmath22 and can be expressed as :    @xmath29    where : @xmath30    @xmath31    and @xmath32 is a parameter related to the surface energy , similarly as in @xcite .",
    "the eos of the nuclear matter is defined for an infinite system , assuming its homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "for such a matter , variance of the associated field @xmath22 vanishes and the average value of the energy per nucleon is determined by the mean value of the field alone .",
    "the field @xmath22 is in this case equivalent to the eos of the nuclear matter .",
    "thus , the functional form of the field @xmath22 can be obtained from the eos by applying the local density approximation .    in the present work we use a 12-parameter cubic form of the eos proposed in @xcite . in the vicinity of the saturation density",
    "it can be approximated using a second order taylor expansion :    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    where :    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    in which @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the total nuclear matter density and the density of isospin and spin balanced matter at saturation , respectively .",
    "the first two terms in ( [ eq : eos_4 - 1 ] ) are just a standard , 6-parameter form of the eos approximation commonly used in the present day experimental and theoretical studies , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the first term describes the symmetric matter in a balanced system ( zero isospin and spin ) , with @xmath43 being the compressibility of the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the second one is a standard approximation of the symmetry energy :    @xmath44    with @xmath45 being the wigner constant and the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the slope and curvature , respectively .",
    "the last two terms of ( [ eq : eos_4 - 1 ] ) are the main novelty of the present approach ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in analogy to the isospin symmetry energy , they describe the spin symmetry energies for neutrons and protons separately :    @xmath48    and the energy of the mutual , spin interaction of protons and neutrons :    @xmath49    the terms with indices @xmath50 , i.e. the @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , ( constant , slope and curvature ) describe the energy of protons or neutrons .",
    "indices @xmath54 indicate that the symmetry energy refers to the mutual interaction of protons and neutrons .",
    "determination of the expansion parameters in ( [ eq : eos_4 - 1 ] ) will be discussed in the next chapters .",
    "using the field @xmath22 one can express the average value of the hamiltonian for a given system of a nucleons as :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the nucleon mass and the last term describes the coulomb energy . as later on we will be searching for the ground state configurations of the even - even nuclei with @xmath57 , it can be assumed that the average momenta of the wave packets @xmath17 are equal to zero and , thus , the first term in the expression ( [ eq : ham ] ) can be neglected .",
    "following a standard approach ( see e.g. @xcite ) it is assumed that the parametrization of the eos includes implicitly the kinetic contribution coming from the fermi motion . as has been demonstrated in @xcite , the adopted cubic approximation of the eos is flexible enough to reproduce typical predictions of sophisticated models of the nuclear matter which explicitly take into account the kinetic contribution resulting from the fermi motion .",
    "since the local density can be written as : @xmath58 the average value of the hamiltonian can be expressed as : @xmath59 as one can see the hamiltonian is a sum of three components , which can be interpreted as a volume , surface and coulomb energies .",
    "therefore the present description can be interpreted as a microscopic realization of the ldm .",
    "finding the ground state configuration of a group of a nucleons within the adopted parametrization of the wave function and for given parameters of the eos , consists in finding the values of parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath60 , which minimize the value of hamiltonian .",
    "the procedure of finding the ground state configurations has been described in sect .",
    "4 of @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the proposed parametrization of the eos , with two more terms in ( 6 ) , is responsible for driving the nucleons of different types , p@xmath61 , p@xmath62 , n@xmath61 , n@xmath62 , to form quadruplets , i.e. to group into @xmath0-like clusters during the minimization procedure .",
    "these two terms play a similar role as the standard symmetry term which attains a minimum when the neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath63 of ( 7 ) tends to zero , i.e. when the neutron - proton couples group together .",
    "this @xmath0-like clustering property of ( 6 ) , is demonstrated in figure [ figmin ] .",
    "p@xmath61 , 3@xmath64p@xmath62 , 3@xmath64n@xmath61 and 3@xmath64n@xmath62 ) during the minimization procedure .",
    "the insets 1 - 6 show the projections of the configurations of nucleons on the x - y plane at selected stages of the minimization .",
    "panel 1 represents the random initial configuration .",
    "panel 6 shows the projection of the final ground state configuration of @xmath65c . ]    the histogram in fig .",
    "[ figmin ] presents the evolution of the binding energy of 12 nucleons during the process of searching for the ground state configuration which minimizes the model hamiltonian ( 16 ) .",
    "the 6 panels of the inset show `` snapshots '' of the projections of the mean positions of the nucleon wave packets onto the x - y plane , at selected stages of the minimization procedure .",
    "panel 1 presents the initial random configuration , panels 2 - 5 some intermediate ones and panel 6 shows the final ground state configuration of @xmath65c .",
    "as can be seen , the minimum of the hamiltonian is achieved for a configuration with three @xmath0-like clusters .",
    "these clusters appear in the corners of an equilateral triangle .",
    "note , that in the figure the triangle is not perfectly equilateral due to the 2-dimensional projection .",
    "it has to be emphasized , that if clusters are allowed to appear in the considered system the description has to be modified .",
    "modifications of the hamiltonian due to clustering will be discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "ground state properties of light charged particles , lcp , such as @xmath66 , @xmath2 , @xmath1he or @xmath0 can provide important constraints on parameters which describe interactions in the nuclear matter for at least four reasons .",
    "first , one can assume that in their structure clusters of matter ( obviously beyond nucleons ) can be formed .",
    "therefore one may expect that clustering of matter has no effect on their binding energies and sizes .",
    "second , these lcps do not contain more than one @xmath0 particle and thus one can neglect the @xmath67 interactions ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) and use the simpler liquid - drop - like hamiltonian ( 16 ) .",
    "third , the measured density profiles of these light particles are relatively well described by gaussian distributions which is in line with the adopted parametrization of the wave function .",
    "fourth , simplicity of these particles assures vanishing of some types of interactions in ( 6 ) and selective increase of sensitivity to some other ones .",
    "for instance , parameters related to the isospin symmetry energy ( second term in ( [ eq : eos_4 - 1 ] ) ) in principle do not affect the binding energy of a deuteron and alpha particle .",
    "similarly , due to the saturation of the proton ( neutron ) spin interactions in @xmath1he ( @xmath2 ) , the mutual spin interaction ( fourth term in ( [ eq : eos_4 - 1 ] ) ) vanishes in their case .    in case of lcps",
    "we can assume that the average value of the hamiltonian is completely determined by the field @xmath22 , by the coulomb interaction and by the surface energy .",
    "this assumption may not be valid for more complex systems in which mutually interacting clusters can be formed , eg . for @xmath68be@xmath69 or @xmath70li@xmath71 . for such systems one can expect additional interactions between clusters due to",
    "the specific many - body forces .",
    "the mean value of the hamiltonian ( 16 ) depends on 13 parameters : 12 parameters of the field @xmath72 plus the surface tension parameter @xmath32 .",
    "binding energies and rms radii of the ground states for @xmath66 , @xmath2 , @xmath1he and @xmath0 provide 8 equations , thus insufficient number of constraints for a unique choice of parameters describing the interaction . in the present section we will try to deduce a subspace of this 13-parameter - space for which the above mentioned properties of lcps are reproduced .",
    "it is clear that the greatest reduction of the number of parameters can be expected in case of an alpha particle . here",
    ", the spin and isospin dependent interactions are practically absent .",
    "thus , properties of alpha particles should be described by four parameters only : @xmath42 , @xmath73 , @xmath43 and @xmath32 .",
    "constraints on these parameters are imposed by the rms radius and the binding energy of an alpha .",
    "these parameters can not be determined unambiguously .",
    "however , there is a flexibility in determining a two - dimensional hypersurface , in the space @xmath42 , @xmath73 , @xmath43 and @xmath32 , in which the searched values of these parameters exist .    in order to determine this hypersurface the following @xmath74 variable",
    "is defined : @xmath75 where , @xmath76 are the experimental and model values of the binding energy and rms radius , respectively .",
    "note that a variable defined this way should be zero in the searched subspace .",
    ", as a function of @xmath73 , @xmath43 and @xmath32 , constrained by the ground state properties of an @xmath0 particle . ]    in order to determine the correlations among the parameters in a searched subspace , the variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 are predefined on a grid , and the remaining two parameters are found by requiring that @xmath77 for the model ground state configurations of an alpha particle .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the figure presents the constant saturation density curves as a function of the other three parameters specified on the axis , which ensure a correct binding energy and rms radius of an alpha particle for the model ground state configurations .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines show how one can determine the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath73 for a given compressibility @xmath43 and saturation density @xmath42 . in the illustrated example",
    "the parameters @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 mev determine the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 mev .",
    "these values of the parameters have been suggested by additional studies of the competition between coulomb , surface and volume energies in the binding energy calculated for the ground state configurations of the heavier nuclei ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this problem will be considered later on .",
    "after fixing the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath73 , @xmath43 and @xmath32 let us try to examine the other ones . for @xmath2 and @xmath1he",
    "the ground state energy does not depend on the choice of parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this results from vanishing of the @xmath86 product in the last term of ( [ eq : eos_4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the binding energies and rms radii for @xmath2 and @xmath1he can provide four equations for six unknown eos parameters : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and so , two equations are still missing .",
    "the two free parameters can be constrained from the properties of heavier nuclei as it was done in the case of the fully symmetric nuclear matter . at this stage",
    "it is only possible to examine the subspace defining the limits for the considered parameters from the properties of the @xmath2 and @xmath1he nuclei .",
    "we notice the fact that the parameters associated with isospin : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 differentiate between the binding energy and the rms radii of @xmath2 and @xmath1he while the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 affect equally the energy and the size of these particles .    using a similar method as in the case of an alpha particle one can find relationships between the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 , by requiring a precise description of the binding energies and radii of the @xmath2 and @xmath1he particles . here , the values of @xmath45 and @xmath47 were varied independently on a grid and the value of @xmath46 was found from the minimization of ( [ eq : ch2 ] ) .",
    "the results of such calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    , and curvature , @xmath47 , of the isospin symmetry energy for different wigner energies , @xmath45 , obtained from fitting the binding energies and rms radii of the @xmath2 and @xmath1he . ]",
    "the figure presents a relationship between the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "selection of two of them allows to determine the third one .",
    "it should be stressed that the above correlations have been obtained as a result of the procedure reproducing the @xmath2 and @xmath1he ground state properties with the parameters @xmath78 @xmath79 , @xmath80 mev , @xmath81 and @xmath82 mev fixed from the ground state properties of an alpha particle ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "three other parameters : @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 were found to be almost independent of @xmath45 and @xmath87      the final values of the eos parameters adopted in this work have been obtained by taking into account also the binding energy and size of a deuteron .",
    "the values have been summarized in tables [ tbl : eos1 ] and [ tbl : eos2 ] .",
    "for this example set of values the model reproduces exactly the experimental values of the rms radii and of the binding energies of the @xmath66 , @xmath2 , @xmath1he and @xmath0 particles ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .    from the point of view of the present work , which focuses on the nuclear systems with even and equal",
    "numbers of protons and neutrons ( i.e. the spin - balanced matter ) , the parameters : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 from the expansion ( [ eq : eos_4 - 1 ] ) are irrelevant . however",
    ", they do play an important role when constructing the ground state configurations and determining the properties of nuclei composed of asymmetric matter .",
    "as far as the interactions between neutrons and protons are concerned , the coulomb repulsion between protons causes that the proton matter tends to locate itself in the outer regions of the nucleus .",
    "this leads to differences between the neutron and proton density distributions , even for symmetric nuclei , and triggers additional interactions associated with the isospin symmetry energy ( proton or neutron skins can be created ) .",
    "this effect can be negligible in case of light nuclei , while for heavier ones it may be more significant .",
    "therefore , for heavier nuclei , one has to use a reliable set of isospin symmetry energy parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , even for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "as has been shown above , the binding energies and the rms radii of @xmath2 , @xmath1he and @xmath0 impose certain constraints on the parameters of the eos . in case of the @xmath73 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath32 parameters ,",
    "once two of them are fixed by some other constraints or means , or from some other evidences , the remaining ones can be determined using the obtained correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . here , the compressibility parameter of symmetric matter @xmath43 should fall within the range of about 250@xmath8850 mev according to the recent experimental constraints ( flow interpretation @xcite , monopole vibrations @xcite , subthreshold kaon production @xcite ) .",
    "it has been fixed to 270 mev in the present approximation .",
    "the volume energy parameter @xmath73 should take the value of about -16 mev according to the ldm . in the present approximation",
    "it has been assumed to have the value of -16.79 mev .",
    "the values of the remaining two parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath32 have been then uniquely determined from the correlation plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in case of the symmetry energy ,",
    "the choice of any two parameters out of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , allows to determine the third one ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the compilation @xcite of the latest results of the nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations suggests that the value of the symmetry energy constant , @xmath45 , and of the slope parameter , @xmath46 , should fall within a range of about 32 @xmath88 1 mev and of about 59 @xmath88 17 mev , respectively . in the present approximation",
    "the values of these parameters have been assumed to be 32 and 59.405 mev , respectively .",
    "these values yield the value of @xmath47 to be about -1250 mev , according to the correlation plot of fig .",
    "the experimental constraint of @xcite on the symmetry energy compressibility parameter , @xmath47 , yields its value to be about @xmath89 200 mev .",
    "another compilation @xcite locates the theoretical values of @xmath47 between @xmath90 and + 466 mev and its experimental values in a range from @xmath91 1350 mev to 34 @xmath88 159 mev .",
    "thus , this parameter is least constrained experimentally and theoretically so far .",
    "its value obtained within the model , preferring very soft symmetry energy , is consistent with the negative experimental constraint , thanks to its large error bar .",
    "however , we should stress that the adopted set of values is not at all unique . as seen from the correlation plots ,",
    "some other choice of parameters is equally well possible .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the assumed value of @xmath42 equal to 0.185 @xmath79 , which fits well properties of the lcps , and is higher than the commonly used values of @xmath92 @xmath79 , may influence values of the remaining parameters .    in order to describe the exotic nuclei and provide more precise parameters of the symmetry energy ,",
    "definitely some more advanced parameter searches will be needed , involving e.g. fitting the properties of the neutron skin nuclei and also of those approaching the proton drip line across the chart of the nuclides , but this is beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "a simple model of nuclei formed out of alpha - like clusters in which interactions lead to strong correlations between nucleons has been presented .",
    "the model interactions have been defined using a cubic approximation of the nuclear eos .",
    "the proposed eos contains additional terms which take into account the spin and isospin polarizations .",
    "these additional terms cause that nucleonic clusters , with an enlarged binding energy , appear in the ground state configurations .",
    "these clusters have full spin - isospin symmetry similarly as in @xcite and in @xcite . for @xmath6-alpha nuclei these clusters",
    "can be identified as alpha like structures .",
    "when these clusters are formed in regions of smaller density , i.e. at the nuclear surface , then their sizes measured as the variance of the density distribution become comparable to the alpha particle size . on the other hand formation of the clusters in the central part of nuclei leads to much bigger spreads of their density distributions and they can hardly be identified as alpha particles .    it has been shown that by taking into account the liquid drop - like form of the hamiltonian in the minimization process it was not possible to describe the subtle changes of the binding energies of nuclei .",
    "therefore the liquid drop part of the hamiltonian has been supplemented by the corrections taking into account the cluster - cluster interactions .",
    "the ground state configurations obtained from the minimization of the full hamiltonian with the imposed structural constraints were found to reproduce very well the experimental binding energies and sizes of the @xmath6-alpha nuclei and the available density profiles . in particular , the model with the cluster corrections has been able to reproduce the `` fine structure '' of the ground state energy distribution ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . in this respect",
    "it seems to be able to mimic the shell effects without explicit spin - orbit term .",
    "the interactions have been defined using a 12 parameter eos approximation .",
    "the thirteenth parameter has been added to control the variance of the field for finite systems .",
    "the values of these parameters and correlations among them have been constrained using the experimental binding energies and sizes of @xmath66 , @xmath2 , @xmath1he and @xmath0 particles .",
    "additional 4 parameters have been introduced in the corrections to the liquid drop part of the hamiltonian in order to account for the interactions between the alpha - like clusters and to substantially improve the model predictions .",
    "the differences between the calculated and measured ground state energies for nuclei with z@xmath1008 are about an order of magnitude smaller than those obtained using the liquid drop model . besides , the obtained parameters describe the properties of the @xmath2 , @xmath1he and @xmath0 very accurately ( practically error free ) .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that correlations between nucleons in the phase space can play an important role in the description of the ground states , particularly of the ground states of nuclei with the same and even number of neutrons and protons .",

    "the hamiltonian ( 16 ) depends on 13 parameters and since the binding energies and rms radii of the ground states of @xmath66 , @xmath2 , @xmath1he and @xmath0 provide only 8 constraints , 5 of the parameters have to be fixed by some other means .    the first step of the procedure to fix the eos parameters consisted in constraining the values of @xmath43 , @xmath42 , @xmath73 and @xmath32 by the binding energy and rms radius of an alpha particle .",
