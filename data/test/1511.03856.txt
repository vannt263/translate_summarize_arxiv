    "the statement , that the assumption of non - interacting magnetic molecules constitutes a paradigm , is of course exaggerated . in the more specific scientific community which deals with magnetic molecules for quantum computing",
    "the question of intermolecular ( and other unwanted ) interactions is of course of utmost importance.@xcite also in low - dimensional magnetism the question arises for instance in connection with dimerization or interchain as well as interlattice interactions.@xcite intermolecular exchange is also carefully taken care of when designing magnetic multi - qubit devices . for these cases",
    "the intermolecular interactions are even made switchable.@xcite    in this paper we would like to approach the problem from a somewhat different perspective .",
    "we would like to ask how big intermolecular interactions have to be in order to modify dc magnetic observables so drastically that the fingerprint of the underlying molecular subunits is masked .",
    "we concentrate our investigations on molecules with an antiferromagnetic intramolecular coupling . for these cases",
    "the low - temperature magnetization curves consist of clearly spaced steps,@xcite which disappear with increasing antiferromagnetic intermolecular interaction .",
    "such a behavior was observed in several recent investigations , compare e.g. refs .  , and interpreted in various ways .",
    "we do nt offer a solution to specific problems , but we would like to present order - of - magnitude calculations that show for which ratios of inter- and intramolecular interactions magnetization steps of finite clusters disappear . we demonstrate that the space dimension of the embedding plays a strong role .    the evaluation of magnetic properties of interacting magnetic molecules constitutes a massive quantum many - body problem , even if only spin hamiltonians are considered .",
    "that s why only two to three dozens of spins @xmath0 can be modeled numerically exactly by diagonalizing a spin hamiltonian even when symmetries are employed.@xcite but for non - frustrated spin systems quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) provides quasi exact thermodynamic observables .",
    "we therefore restrict our investigations to a series of such systems , which should be sufficient for the purpose of this paper .",
    "the clear advantage is that we do not rely on mean field approximations.@xcite    the result of our investigations is that single molecule signatures are washed out in the magnetization if the intermolecular interactions are stronger than about 10  % of the intramolecular interactions .",
    "the specific value depends on the space dimension of the embedding , e.g. for intermolecular interactions in three dimensions a smaller intermolecular interaction is needed to mask the molecular behavior than in lower dimensions .",
    "we compare some of our results with the scenario of j - strain , that sometimes is also taken into consideration for the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "finally , we would like to draw the readers attention to related investigations .",
    "an important related problem is given by the influence of interchain or interplane interactions on magnetic observables and in particular ordering temperatures in antiferromagnetic systems .",
    "such questions are also dealt with by means of qmc for instance in refs .  .",

    "section  [ sec-3 ] presents magnetization , susceptibility and specific heat for dimers , squares and cubes embedded in one , two and three dimensions , respectively , whereas section  [ sec-4 ] discusses the magnetism of dimers with intermolecular interactions in one , two and three dimensions . in section  [ sec-5 ] a comparison with the scenario of j - strain",
    "is presented .",
    "the article closes with summary and outlook .",
    "the investigated spin systems are modeled by a heisenberg hamiltonian augmented with a zeeman term , i. e. @xmath1 thermodynamic observables are evaluated by means of quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) using the alps package.@xcite the prefactors in ( [ e-2 - 1 ] ) are chosen according to the convention used in alps , in particular a negative heisenberg exchange corresponds to an antiferromagnetic interaction . without loss of generality @xmath0 is chosen as spin quantum number , and the spectroscopic splitting factor is taken as @xmath2 for all spins .    in our qmc calculations",
    "we choose @xmath3 for one - dimensional problems , @xmath4 for two - dimensional problems as well as @xmath5 for three - dimensional problems . in all cases",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied . for magnetization curves we use 100000 steps for thermalization and another 100000 steps for sampling . in case of susceptibility and specific heat functions of temperature at @xmath6 thermalization",
    "is done with 10000000 steps and sampling with 200000000 steps .",
    "although we used @xmath7 for the latter functions , convergence was very slow at the lowest temperatures , which can be seen in the upcoming plots . fortunately , this does not alter our conclusions .",
    ", dashed bonds @xmath8.,width=226 ]    in the following magnetic observables are presented for small magnetic units ( molecules ) that are investigated in dependence of the intermolecular interaction .",
    "these investigations have been performed for couplings in one , two and three space dimensions .",
    "our main concern is the magnetization curve , since this curve usually exhibits a very strong dependence on whether and how subunits are magnetically coupled.@xcite for small systems the magnetization curve exhibits clear fingerprints of the specific unit , such as magnetization steps .",
    "we follow two rationals when comparing the behavior in different space dimensions . in the first investigation",
    "each spin interacts with the same number of intramolecular @xmath9 and intermolecular @xmath8 bonds with its neighbors .",
    "this is realized by dimers in one , squares in two and cubes in three dimensions .",
    "in addition , the size of the singlet - triplet gap is the same for dimer and square and almost the same ( 80  % ) for the cube . in a second investigation the molecular unit",
    "is kept fixed as dimers , and the dimension of the embedding is varied .",
    "one - dimensional systems have been very thoroughly investigated over almost a century .",
    "the famous bethe ansatz for the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain and the resulting knowledge on observables as well as the haldane conjecture are cornerstones of this research.@xcite here we focus on the question how magnetic observables develop with an increasing intermolecular interaction @xmath8 between dimers that are coupled through @xmath9 , compare fig .

    "both interactions are antiferromagnetic .",

    "[ intermolecular - f-7 ] one immediately realizes that already a rather small intermolecular interaction of 10  % suffices to wash out the magnetization steps of the spin cube .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the cube has almost the same singlet - triplet gap as dimer and square , so the effect is not thermal .",
    "we thus speculate that the dimensionality of the embedding structure , here three , is responsible for the quick disappearance of the molecular fingerprints with increasing intermolecular interaction .     for various interdimer couplings",

    "finally , as a supplement to the presented investigations , we would like to discuss the question whether a similar modification of observables could stem from j - strain .",
    "the assumption of strain , for instance g - strain , is not unusual for instance when modeling epr lines .",
    "j - strain , i.e. a distribution of @xmath25 values about a mean was used in several theoretical models , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "the effect of j - strain is rather similar to that of intermolecular interactions : magnetization steps are smeared out , and susceptibility as well as specific heat as functions of temperature are not much altered .",

    "@xmath28 was chosen such , that the saturation field for the three cases discussed in section [ sec-4 ] is met .",
    "figure  [ intermolecular - f-11 ] shows a comparison of the magnetization of a single dimer ( black solid curve ) , of dimers with intermolecular interactions in one , two , and three space dimensions ( dashed curves ) as well as of dimers with j - strain according to the flat distribution ( solid colored curves ) .",
    "one immediately realizes that the functional form of the magnetization curve with j - strain is different from the behavior under the influence of intermolecular interactions .",
    "although the saturation field is met by tuning @xmath28 appropriately , the onset of the magnetization curves happens already at smaller fields .",
    "in addition , at the field value where the magnetization step happens for the unperturbed dimer , the magnetization curves of dimers with j - strain cross at half the step height whereas for intermolecular interactions the magnetization curves cross at a lower magnetization .",
    "overall , the magnetization curves for j - strain are symmetric about the crossing field value .",
    "this would also hold if another ( more realistic , but also symmetric about @xmath29 ) gaussian distribution of @xmath9 values would have been taken .",
    "intermolecular interactions on the contrary seem to lead to magnetization curves , that do not show any symmetry with respect to the original crossing field .",

    "we investigated the question how intermolecular interactions influence magnetic observables for small ( molecular ) magnetic units .",
    "in particular we investigated for certain bipartite configurations how large the intermolecular interaction needs to be compared to the intramolecular interaction in order to mask the molecular behavior .",
    "it could be demonstrated that the various static magnetic observables reflect intermolecular interactions differently : the low - temperature magnetization turned out to be most sensitive , since the appearance of magnetization steps appears to be fragile .",
    "in addition dimensionality plays a role . with increasing space dimensionality of the intermolecular coupling the effect of masking molecular properties happens for smaller intermolecular coupling .",
    "finally we discussed briefly whether similar modifications of observables could be misinterpreted as j - strain .",
    "we pointed out , that certain features of the observables are different in the two scenarios , so that with good quality of experimental data a discrimination should be possible .",
