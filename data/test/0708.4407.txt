    "the scenario of @xmath0 users wanting to communicate to a single destination using cooperative strategies . for simplicity , we consider one of the @xmath0 users as the source and the remaining @xmath1 users as relays .",
    "predominantly there are two types of relaying strategies discussed in the literature , i.e. , 1 ) amplify and forward and 2 ) decode and forward . in this work ,",
    "we focus only on amplify and forward based relaying strategies wherein the relays are allowed to perform linear processing of the received signal . amplify and forward based relaying is simpler and moreover does not require the relays to have knowledge of the codebook used by the source or the knowledge of the source to relay channel fading gains . recently in @xcite , the idea of space - time coding for collocated mimo ( multiple input multiple output ) systems has been applied in the setting of cooperative wireless relay networks in the name of distributing space - time coding , wherein coding is performed across users and time .",
    "this strategy provides each user a diversity order equal to the number of relays even though all the users are only equipped with a single antenna .",
    "the diversity thus achieved is called as cooperative diversity .",
    "however , such strategies require that the destination have complete knowledge of the fading coefficients from all the users to itself as well as that of the fading coefficients between users .",
    "obtaining the knowledge of the fading coefficients between the users at the destination requires additional resources . to solve this problem , in @xcite , kiran _",
    "et al _ have proposed a differential encoding / decoding setup for cooperative wireless networks that does not require the knowledge of fading coefficients between the users at the destination .",
    "such codes were named as partially coherent distributed space - time codes in @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the same strategy of @xcite offers full diversity with a suboptimal receiver that does not require the knowledge of any of the fading coefficients . in an independent work @xcite , jing and jafarkhani have proposed a differential encoding / decoding setup for cooperative wireless relay networks which is more general than the setup proposed in @xcite and they have also provided few code constructions .",
    "we call the class of differential space - time codes ( dstcs ) which can be used in a distributed manner for cooperative diversity as distributed dstcs ( and denote by ddstcs ) to differentiate them from dstcs for collocated mimo systems",
    ". the problem of designing ddstcs is more challenging than that of dstcs for collocated mimo systems , since in this scenario we have additional constraints to be satisfied which are due to the cooperative diversity protocol . in @xcite ,",
    "the setup of @xcite has been generalized to the case when the source and destination nodes have multiple antennas . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose the use of a random diagonal unitary matrix codebook in general and for certain specific number of relays ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) propose the use of cyclic codes .",
    "however , a random code is not guaranteed to offer full diversity . moreover designing good cyclic codes",
    "becomes difficult for large number of relays . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose the use of alamouti code and @xmath5 code for the specific case of @xmath6 and @xmath7 relays .",
    "for an arbitrary number of relays , the authors construct fully diverse ddstcs based on circulant matrices .",
    "but , except for the alamouti code all other ddstc constructions in the literature @xcite have large decoding complexity .",
    "thus , a general full diversity code construction targeting the requirements of low encoding complexity as well as low decoding complexity is not available .",
    "this issue gains significant importance especially if the number of cooperating terminals is large , which is quite expected in applications like wireless sensor networks .    in this paper",
    "we address this issue and present the following contributions :    * the notion of encoding complexity for space - time codes in terms of @xmath8-group encodability is introduced ( definition [ defn1 ] ) and its significance is highlighted .",
    "* the differential encoding / decoding setup introduced by kiran _",
    "et al _ @xcite , oggier _ et al _ @xcite and jing _ et al _ @xcite for wireless relay networks that use codebooks consisting of unitary matrices is generalized to allow codebooks consisting of scaled unitary matrices .",
    "this generalization aids in reducing the encoding / decoding complexity of ddstcs .",
    "when the codebook of scaled unitary matrices is used in the jing - hassibi protocol @xcite for differential encoding at the source , the extra conditions involving the interrelationship between relay matrices and the codeword matrices that need to be satisfied are identified ( eqn . ) . * using the algebraic framework of extended clifford algebras , a new class of ddstcs satisfying these extra conditions ( constructions [ cons_design ] and [ cons_signalset ] ) is proposed which achieves full diversity with a low complexity sub - optimal receiver ( theorem [ thm_relay ] ) .",
    "explicit construction of multidimensional signal sets that lead to full diversity ( theorem [ thm_signalset ] ) are also provided . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first known low decoding complexity ddstc scheme for cooperative wireless networks which is available for all power of two number of relays .",
    "section [ sec2 ] introduces the system model for the distributed differential encoding / decoding setup employing a differential scaled unitary matrix codebook at the source . in section [ sec3 ] , the notion of @xmath8-group encodable and @xmath8-group decodable space - time codes is discussed for the system model of section [ sec2 ] and the problem statement for ddstcs with low encoding and decoding complexity is given .",
    "the extra conditions on the code structure imposed by the cooperative diversity protocol of @xcite are then described . in section [ sec4 ] , we explicitly construct a family of dstcs using extended clifford algebras and prove using algebraic techniques that they satisfy the extra conditions needed for ddstcs .",

    "2 .   even if the relay matrices are obtained , an initial vector satisfying condition may not exist for the chosen relay matrices .    for the specific case of @xmath250 ,",
    "things were possible because the linear designs correspond to left regular matrix representation of an algebra over @xmath251 and hence using algebraic techniques , it was possible to construct the relay matrices and the initial vector satisfying all the required conditions .    optimizing the signal sets for coding gain might be possible for small number of relays and for small number of points .",

    "the resulting linear designs are precisely those given by construction [ cons_design ] .",
    "this has been explicitly shown in more detail in @xcite .",
    "let us prove the theorem assuming that all the complex variables of the linear design take values from the entire complex field .",

    "that @xmath284 is a ring homomorphism , these matrices are guaranteed to commute with all the codewords because they are matrix representations of elements belonging to the center of the algebra @xmath279 . to obtain the remaining @xmath45 relay matrices , we need to find unitary matrices which satisfy @xmath285 where , @xmath12 is any codeword .",
    "but the codeword @xmath12 is simply a matrix representation of some element belonging to the extended clifford algebra .",
    "one method to get these relay matrices is to take them from within the extended clifford algebra itself . by doing so , we can translate the condition in into a condition on elements of the algebra which will then provide us a handle on the problem . towards that end ,",
    "we first identify a map in the algebra which is the analogue of taking the conjugate of the matrix representation of an element .",
    "note from appendix [ appendix1 ] that we used the fact that @xmath268 can be thought of as the complex number @xmath272 .",
    "when we take the conjugate of a matrix , we simply replace @xmath25 by @xmath286 .",
    "hence the analogue of this action in the algebra is to replace @xmath268 by @xmath287 .",
    "thus , the analogous map @xmath288 in the algebra is defined as follows : @xmath289 where , the element @xmath290 is obtained from @xmath16 by simply replacing @xmath268 by @xmath287 in the expression of @xmath16 in terms of the natural @xmath291-basis of extended clifford algebra .",
    "now the problem is to find @xmath45 distinct elements denoted by @xmath292 of the algebra @xmath279 which satisfy @xmath293 .",
    "the elements of the union of the following two sets satisfy the above required condition .",
    "@xmath294 this can be proved by using the anti - commuting property , i.e. , @xmath295 .",
