    "over the last few years , the lyman break technique has been used extensively to isolate galaxies at @xmath0  24 ( e.g. , steidel et  al . 1996 ; lowenthal et  al .",
    "1997 ; dickinson 1998 ; steidel et  al .",
    "1999 ) observed near the peak in the cosmic star - formation rate ( e.g. , blain et  al .",
    "these objects often exhibit stellar and interstellar absorption lines characteristic of local starburst galaxies .",
    "their morphologies are varied , with multiple knots of emission and diffuse wispy tails that suggest nonrelaxed systems .",
    "the lyman break technique has found particular application in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ; williams et  al .",
    "1996 ) due to the excellent imaging data and photometry available there , although the small angular size of the hdf - n limits somewhat its utility for statistical studies ( e.g. , dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "we have recently completed an @xmath4  ms observation of the hdf - n and its environs with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( weisskopf et  al . 2000 ) : the  deep field north (; brandt et  al . 2001b , hereafter paper  v ) .",
    "in addition to probing luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) throughout the universe , this survey is also useful for studying x - ray emission from more `` normal '' galaxies where the emission originates from x - ray binaries , supernova remnants , and low - luminosity agn ( llagn ; e.g. , hornschemeier et  al .",
    "2001 , paper  ii ; brandt et  al . 2001a , paper  iv ) .",
    "stacking techniques are particularly powerful in this regard , since they allow detection of x - ray emission from objects lying below the detection limit for individual sources . in paper",
    "iv we used stacking techniques to constrain the x - ray emission from normal spiral galaxies out to @xmath0  0.51 , finding that their x - ray luminosities were not more than a factor of @xmath5 larger ( per unit @xmath3-band luminosity ) than those of spiral galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath6 ) . stacking analyses using the 480  ks of data available at the time allowed effective exposures of 58  ms to be achieved .    with",
    "the additional  data recently obtained and improvements in our data processing techniques , we are now able to extend our constraints on galaxy x - ray luminosities to higher redshift .",
    "this is of cosmological interest since the x - ray luminosities of normal galaxies are expected to evolve with redshift due to the changing cosmic star - formation rate ( e.g. , van  paradijs 1978 ; white & ghosh 1998 ; ghosh & white 2001 ; ptak et  al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    "we present constraints on the x - ray emission from the lyman break galaxy population found in the hdf - n itself .",
    "the galactic column density along this line of sight is @xmath7  @xmath8 ( stark et  al .",
    "@xmath9  km  s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are adopted throughout this paper .",
    "coordinates throughout this paper are j2000 .",
    "we have used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; g.p .",
    "garmire et  al . , in preparation ) data sets and basic analysis methods described in paper  v. we employ three standard x - ray bands : 0.58.0  kev ( full band ) , 0.52.0  kev ( soft band ) , and 28  kev ( hard band ) .",
    "we use data screened with the restricted acis grade set defined in table  2 of paper  v , since this screening provides significantly improved signal - to - noise for faint sources .",
    "we restrict our focus to the data obtained within the hdf - n itself ; our x - ray coverage is deepest in this area , and the  background and point - spread function ( psf ) are relatively uniform over the hdf - n .",
    "positions within the hdf - n are good to within @xmath12 .    for the stacking analysis",
    ", we selected galaxies in the hdf - n itself using the spectroscopic redshift catalogs of cohen et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , cohen ( 2001 ) , dawson et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and references therein .",
    "we considered the @xmath13  24 galaxies spectroscopically identified in the hdf - n ; there are 28 such objects , and most were found using the lyman break technique ( the   @xmath14 filter has allowed lyman break galaxies to be found down to @xmath15 in the hdf - n ; e.g. , dickinson 1998 ) . prior to stacking , we verified that none of the objects being stacked was individually detected by .",
    "this was accomplished by searching for nearby ( within @xmath16 ) x - ray sources found by wavdetect with a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath17 ( dobrzycki et  al .",
    "1999 ; freeman et  al .",
    "2001 ) ; it led to the removal of one source , the @xmath18 agn 123639.6 + 621230 ( associated with cxohdfn  j123639.5 + 621230 ) .",
    "we have also manually inspected  images in all three of the standard x - ray bands and removed three lyman break galaxies lying near unrelated x - ray sources .",
    "123645.3 + 621153 was removed because it lies within the region covered by the faint extended source cxohdfn  j123645.0 + 621142 .",
    "123645.8 + 621411 and 123654.7 + 621314 were removed because they lie relatively near ( 68@xmath19 ) the bright x - ray sources cxohdfn  j123646.3 + 621404 and cxohdfn  j123655.4 + 621311 , respectively , and could be affected by the low - level wings of the  psf . while we consider it unlikely that these three lyman break galaxies suffer from significant contamination by the unrelated x - ray sources , we wanted to be cautious and avoid any problems with the background estimation .",
    "figure  1 shows the redshifts and @xmath20 magnitudes of the 24 selected objects .",
    "the median redshift of the selected objects is @xmath21 , corresponding to a median lookback time of 11.9  gyr ( 84% of the age of the universe ) and a median luminosity distance of 25,800  mpc ( hogg 1999 ) .",
    "these galaxies have a range of morphologies but generally appear nonrelaxed .",
    "they do not show signs of containing agn in their optical spectra , although the spectral quality is often limited .",
    "they were not identified as agn candidates by jarvis & macalpine ( 1998 ) , conti et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , or sarajedini et  al .",
    "two of the 24 galaxies have weak ( 68  @xmath22jy ) radio emission at 8.5  ghz ( richards et  al .",
    "1998 ) ; this emission could be due to either starburst activity or agn .    for each of the standard x - ray bands , we stacked `` cutout '' images centered on the positions of the 24 selected galaxies . for the photometry below we use an approximately circular aperture comprised of the 30 pixels with centers within @xmath23 of the stacking position ( see  3.4 of paper  iv ) . in figure",
    "2 we show the number of full - band and soft - band counts obtained for each of the individual galaxies being stacked , and in figure  3 we show images created from the stacked data .",
    "the stacked full - band image has an effective exposure time of 22.44  ms ( 260  days ) . in this image",
    ", we find 164 counts within the 30-pixel aperture , while 134.3 are expected from the background .",
    "the poisson probability of obtaining 164 counts or more when 134.3 are expected is @xmath24 , indicating a detection at the 99.5% confidence level . in the stacked soft - band image ( 22.46  ms exposure )",
    ", we find 43 counts when 26.2 are expected from background , corresponding to a detection at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "the higher significance of the soft - band detection is most likely due to the lower background in this band .",
    "no significant detection is obtained in the hard band ; unfortunately , the spectral constraint implied by the hard - band nondetection is not physically interesting .",
    "following appendix  a of paper  iv , we performed monte carlo stacking simulations to assess false - detection probabilities empirically . for each band",
    ", we performed 100,000 trials where we stacked 24 random positions using the same photometry aperture as was used for the lyman break galaxies above .",
    "the random positions were chosen to lie within @xmath25 `` local background regions '' centered on each of the lyman break galaxies ( avoiding known  sources ) to reproduce the actual background as closely as possible .",
    "figure  4 displays the number of trials giving a particular number of counts for the full and soft bands .",
    "the resulting distributions are very nearly gaussian . in",
    "the full band 518 of the 100,000 stacking trials gave 164 counts or more ; the corresponding detection confidence level of 99.5% is in excellent agreement with that computed from poisson statistics above . in",
    "the soft band 103 of the 100,000 stacking trials gave 43 counts or more ; again the corresponding detection confidence level of 99.9% agrees well with poisson statistics .",
    "again , no significant detection is obtained in the hard band .",
    "we performed several additional tests to verify the robustness of our results .",
    "if we include the three lyman break galaxies excluded above because they lie near to unrelated x - ray sources ( 123645.3 + 621153 , 123645.8 + 621411 , and 123654.7 + 621314 ) , the statistical significance of our results is improved .",
    "we varied the size of the local background regions to examine if background gradients could be confusing the stacking analysis ; our results remain highly significant for local background region sizes of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "because use of the local background regions limits the number of independent random positions that can be chosen in the monte carlo simulations , we also performed simulations with `` global background regions . '' for these simulations we drew the random positions from larger areas , not restricting the positions to lie close to the lyman break galaxies .",
    "the statistical significance of our results remained the same or was slightly improved .",
    "finally , we varied the size of our photometry aperture , and our results remain significant for reasonable aperture - size choices . in fact , reducing the aperture size to include only the 14 pixels with centers within @xmath29 of the stacking position improves the statistical significance by a further factor of @xmath30 in both the full and soft bands .",
    "we note that our results can not be explained by instrumental effects ( e.g. , subtle cosmic ray afterglows ) since such effects will not be preferentially correlated with lyman break galaxies . moreover , unrelated galaxies at lower redshift that by chance lie within our stacking apertures can not explain the observed signal since these galaxies will be found equally in both the lyman break galaxy stacking and the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the stacking analyses above extend our ability to detect relatively normal galaxies in the x - ray band to substantially higher redshifts ( @xmath13  24 ) than was previously possible . at the median redshift of our sample of @xmath21 ,",
    "the observed - frame full and soft bands correspond to rest - frame bands of 2.031.4  kev and 2.07.8  kev , respectively . provided the basic x - ray production mechanisms of lyman break galaxies are similar to those of spiral galaxies in the local universe , the emission in these bands should have an effective power - law photon index of @xmath31 ( e.g. , kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ; ptak et  al .",
    "1999 ) ; this is a typical photon index for both x - ray binaries and llagn . in the soft band , where we obtain the highest significance detection ,",
    "the measured count rate ( @xmath32  count  s@xmath2 ) corresponds to an average observed - frame flux of @xmath33  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath2 and an average rest - frame 2.07.8  kev luminosity of @xmath34  erg  s@xmath2 ( at the median redshift ) .",
    "erg  @xmath8  s@xmath2 , corresponding to a rest - frame 2.07.8  kev luminosity of @xmath35  erg  s@xmath2 . ]",
    "note that these lyman break galaxies are @xmath36 times more luminous from 28  kev than the 11 normal spiral galaxies at @xmath37 studied in  4.2 of paper  iv . since these lyman break galaxies are thought to contain significant starburst activity ( see  1 ) , it is appropriate to compare their x - ray luminosities to those of local starbursts . on average",
    "the 28  kev luminosities of these lyman break galaxies are @xmath30 times larger than that of the starburst galaxy m82 ( e.g. , griffiths et  al .",
    "2000 ; kaaret et  al .",
    "2001 ) and are comparable to that of ngc  3256 , one of the most x - ray luminous starbursts in the local universe ( e.g. , moran , lehnert , & helfand 1999 ; lira et  al .",
    "the star - formation rates in these lyman break galaxies are uncertain but are thought to be often @xmath38  3050  m@xmath39  yr@xmath2 , compared to @xmath40  m@xmath39  yr@xmath2 for m82 and @xmath41  m@xmath39  yr@xmath2 for ngc  3256 .",
    "the hdf - n lyman break galaxies are optically luminous with @xmath3-band luminosities somewhat greater than present - day @xmath42 ; a present - day @xmath42 galaxy has a @xmath3-band luminosity density of @xmath43  erg  s@xmath2  hz@xmath2 ( e.g. , blanton et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "the 24 lyman break galaxies used in the stacking analysis above have a mean rest - frame @xmath44  erg  s@xmath2  hz@xmath2 [ the median @xmath45  erg  s@xmath2  hz@xmath2 , and the range is @xmath46  ( 0.46.6)@xmath47  erg  s@xmath2  hz@xmath2 ] ; this is @xmath49 times larger than for the 11 normal spiral galaxies at @xmath37 studied in  4.2 of paper  iv .",
    "values for the lyman break galaxies have been calculated using the observed - frame @xmath50-band data in table  2 of papovich , dickinson , & ferguson ( 2001 ) and the irregular galaxy spectral energy distribution from coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) .",
    "the good match between the @xmath50-band data and rest - frame @xmath3 for these objects removes nearly all of the dependence of @xmath51 on the spectral energy distribution . ] therefore , the hdf - n lyman break galaxies are @xmath52 times more x - ray luminous per unit @xmath3-band luminosity than normal spiral galaxies at @xmath37 ( also see shapley , fabbiano , & eskridge 2001 ) . an elevated ratio of x - ray to @xmath3-band luminosity is observed in many starburst galaxies at low redshift . the starburst galaxies in  3 of david , jones , & forman ( 1992 ) have x - ray to @xmath3-band luminosity ratios @xmath53  315 times higher than for normal galaxies ( for example , this ratio is @xmath54 times higher for m82 ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray to @xmath3-band luminosity ratios for lyman break galaxies are somewhat , but not greatly , higher than those of local starbursts . if the lyman break galaxies suffered from more dust obscuration than local starbursts , this could explain their higher x - ray to @xmath3-band luminosity ratios ; dust would attenuate @xmath3-band emission substantially more than 28  kev emission .    theoretical efforts to predict the x - ray evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , van  paradijs 1978 ; white & ghosh 1998 ; ghosh & white 2001 ; ptak et  al .",
    "2001 ) have typically focused on their low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) populations which are predicted to peak in luminosity at @xmath55 .",
    "much less work has been carried out , however , at the higher redshifts under study here . if the x - ray emission of lyman break galaxies is indeed produced via the same mechanisms as those operating in local starburst galaxies , then high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) and `` super - eddington '' x - ray sources ( e.g. , makishima et  al .",
    "2000 ) are likely to produce much of the observed emission in the rest - frame 28  kev band . unlike lmxbs , which have an evolutionary timescale of @xmath56  yr",
    ", the x - ray emission from hmxbs should track the cosmic star - formation rate closely ( any lmxbs contributing to the observed x - ray emission would have formed at @xmath57 ) . given the results from submillimeter and other surveys which are sensitive to star formation in dusty environments ,",
    "cosmic star formation is likely to peak at roughly the redshifts under study here ( e.g. , blain et  al . 1999 ) .",
    "the cosmic evolution of super - eddington x - ray sources is impossible to predict reliably at present given that even the basic nature of these objects is poorly understood at low redshift .",
    "llagn with 28  kev luminosities @xmath58",
    "erg  s@xmath2 could also contribute to the observed x - ray emission from some of these lyman break galaxies , although none of the galaxies under study here has been found to contain an llagn ( see  2 ) ; again , even the most basic properties of llagn at these redshifts are poorly constrained by current data .",
    "finally , these results show that the  acis performs well at source detection even with effective exposure times of 260 days ( the current longest  exposures are 11.6  days for the cdf - n and the  deep field south ) .",
    "any systematic effects that cause the sensitivity to deviate from that expected due to photon statistics appear mild . stacking analyses using deeper observations with  should allow this work to be extended .",
    "missions such as  should ultimately allow the x - ray study of individual lyman break galaxies .",
