    "starting with the pioneering work of burlaga ( @xcite ) a considerable number of studies have been dedicated to the analysis of the intermittent nature of the solar wind turbulence ( see @xcite for a review ) . in particular , the phenomenon of intermittency , as the inhomogeneity of the energy transfer rate in the turbulent nonlinear cascade , has been identified in fluctuations of plasma variables and of the magnetic field in the entire heliosphere @xcite , in the distant heliosheath @xcite , and near the heliopause @xcite .",
    "the level of intermittency in the solar wind turbulence has been mainly determined by the analysis of the anomalous scaling of structure functions @xcite , by considering probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of fluctuations and departure from gaussianity for smaller scales @xcite , by using the scale behavior of the flatness ( or fourth - order moment ) and fitting of the pdfs @xcite , or by fitting models of turbulence @xcite .",
    "+ multifractal analysis is a higher - order method used to reveal the intermittent nature of various characteristics of turbulence ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the degree of multifractality is a measure of the level of heterogeneity in the local scaling indices ; in other words , it informs about the departure from a strict self - similarity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is also a quantitative measure of the intermittency successfully used in many studies of turbulence @xcite .",
    "+ the analysis of observations at the ecliptic showed that fast solar wind is generally less intermittent than slow wind for both wind speed and magnetic field components @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite studied the intermittent properties of the fast wind in the inner heliosphere from helios data ( between @xmath0 and @xmath1 au ) and concluded that fast wind intermittency increases with the distance from the sun .",
    "+ considerable effort has been devoted to investigating the evolution of intermittency in interplanetary magnetic fields with distance and latitude in the solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite focused on the different intermittent levels of magnetic field fluctuations measured by _ ulysses _ during solar minimum ( 1994 - 1996 ) and solar maximum ( 2000 - 2001 ) and found a high level of intermittency throughout the both phases of the solar cycle .",
    "moreover , they showed that the slow wind has a lower level of intermittency as compared with the fast flow .",
    "however , these authors used only the wind speed as a criterion to discriminate between pure coronal fast and typical equatorial slow wind .",
    "further analysis of pure polar coronal fast wind at solar minimum between 1994 and 1996 @xcite shows that inertial range intermittency at time scales between 40 and 200 seconds , described as departure of pdfs from gaussianity , increases with increasing radial distance from the sun .",
    "+ @xcite performed a detailed selection of the so - called  pure \" states of the solar wind encountered by _",
    "ulysses _ between 1992 and 1997 .",
    "it was shown that slow wind is more intermittent than fast wind and no radial evolution was found for the slow wind . however , the heliocentric radial variations during the time intervals studied by @xcite were rather limited ( @xmath2 au ) , as was the heliolatitude range ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "there are very few comparative studies of solar wind intermittent turbulence at solar minimum and solar maximum out of the ecliptic plane .",
    "therefore , a systematic analysis of data for a larger range of radial distances and heliolatitudes may allow a better understanding of the nature of intermittency out of the ecliptic plane .",
    "+ in this study , we use _ ulysses _ data recorded during the last two minima of the solar cycle ( 1997 - 1998 and 2007 - 2008 ) , as well as during the previous maximum ( 1999 - 2001 ) ; the database includes 130 time intervals of  pure \" slow and fast solar wind , whose selection procedure is described in the next section . based on these data ,",
    "we construct a more complete picture of the multifractal scaling and intermittent nature of the turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane .",
    "this is the comprehensive study of such a magnitude devoted to the multifractal spectrum of fluctuations of the interplanetary magnetic field strength measured at different heliocentric distances and heliographic latitudes during two solar minima ( 1997 - 1998 , 2007 - 2008 ) and a solar maximum ( 1999 - 2001 ) .",
    "the selected data cover a radial range between 1.5 and 5.4 au and a heliolatitude range between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "_ ulysses _ is a joint esa - nasa mission launched in 1990 october .",
    "the probe completed roughly three solar orbits before the mission ended in 2009 june .",
    "the orbit of _ ulysses _ was periodic ( 6.2 years ) , with perihelion at 1.3 au and aphelion at 5.4 au and a latitudinal excursion of @xmath6 allowing the study of both latitudinal and radial dependence of the solar wind over a wide range of solar activity conditions @xcite . in this study",
    ", we focused on the slow and fast solar wind data measured in situ by the _ ulysses _ during two solar minima ( 1997 - 1998 , 2007 - 2008 ) and a solar maximum ( 1999 - 2001 ) . to identify the solar wind type and origin",
    "we define a set of criteria and thresholds applied on plasma and magnetic field data .",
    "thus , we use five parameters to discriminate between the fast and slow solar wind state : ( 1 ) the radial velocity , ( 2 ) the proton density , ( 3 ) proton temperature parameters measured by the swoops instrument @xcite , ( 4 ) the oxygen ion ratio ( @xmath7 ) from swics @xcite , and ( 5 ) the magnetic compressibility factor calculated from magnetic field measurements by the vhm - fgm magnetometer @xcite . for each of the five parameters",
    ", we defined a threshold value as a transition from slow to fast wind:(1 ) @xmath8 km s@xmath9 , ( 2 ) @xmath10 @xmath11 , ( 3)@xmath12 k , ( 4 ) @xmath13 , and ( 5 ) @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we also take into account the solar cycle variation of these thresholds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and exclude time intervals corresponding to interplanetary transients like shocks and cmes , identified by gosling and forysth ( see http://www.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk/ulysses/shocklist.txt ) and gosling and ebert ( see http://swoops.lanl.gov + /cme_list.html ) .",
    "we identified @xmath15 time intervals of fast solar wind ( @xmath16 during solar maximum and @xmath17 during solar minimum ) and @xmath18 time intervals of slow solar wind ( @xmath19 during solar maximum and @xmath20 during solar minimum ) .",
    "the multifractality is checked for each data set that contains a few days long time series of the magnetic field strength measured with a @xmath21 hz sampling rate .",
    "the multifractal approach is a generalization of fractal analysis used to characterize objects that demonstrate a variety of self - similarities at various scales .",
    "a detailed description of the multifractal theory can be found in , e.g. , the works of @xcite or @xcite",
    ". one of the basic characteristics of multifractal scaling is the multifractal spectrum @xmath22 , sketched in figure  1 of the paper by @xcite . as a function of a singularity strength @xmath23",
    ", @xmath22 portrays the variability in the scaling properties of the measures .",
    "in particular , the width of the spectrum quantifies the degree of multifractality of a given system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "+ there are several techniques to obtain multifractal spectra from the experimental data . in this study , we use two methods : the partition function technique @xcite and the direct method of determination of a multifractal spectrum proposed by @xcite , both successfully tested in many situations for space plasma turbulence @xcite and briefly described below . + in the first step of the analysis , we construct a multifractal measure @xcite from the first moment of increments of magnetic fluctuations at a scale @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , with @xmath27 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 denoting the data set length as a power of 2 , while @xmath30 denotes the magnetic field strength .",
    "next , we decompose the signal in segments of size @xmath24 and associate with each @xmath31th segment a probability measure defined by @xmath32 this quantity can be interpreted as a probability that the portion of fluctuation is transferred to a segment of size @xmath24 . as is typical , at a given position @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the average solar wind speed , the temporal scales measured in units of sampling time @xmath35 can be interpreted as the spatial scales @xmath36 ( the taylor hypothesis )",
    "next , the scaling of the partition function , @xmath37 , for various box size @xmath24 and moments of order @xmath38 is considered according to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the scaling exponent .",
    "the scaling exponents @xmath40 are extracted from the slopes of the logarithm of the partition function @xmath41 versus @xmath42 ( eq .",
    "( [ e : w : spf ] ) ) . in the next step",
    ", @xmath22 is determined by a legendre transformation of the @xmath40 curve with @xmath43= \\tau'(q)$ ] and @xmath44 @xcite . in the case of the direct method of determination of a multifractal spectrum , the so - called pseudoprobability measure , @xmath45 ,",
    "is determined from @xmath46 next , the multifractal spectrum can be calculated directly from the average of the pseudoprobability measure @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 indicates ensemble averaging .",
    "the corresponding average value of the singularity strength is given by@xcite @xmath50    the scaling range where a linear regression is applied to determine @xmath40 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is not known a priori , and it must be chosen before the analysis . in this study , we apply an automatic selection procedure proposed by @xcite . in most cases",
    ", we identified a scaling range from 4 s to a few days that can be somewhat related to the existence of the inertial range and with the dissipation effects observed on smaller scales .",
    "cases , for which the optimal scaling range could not be determined , have been rejected from a further analysis .",
    "+ the two points @xmath53 and @xmath54 , at which @xmath55 , quantify the degree of multifractality @xcite : @xmath56 owing to the limited amount of data available from _ ulysses _ in the solar wind , we can only determine the points near the maximum of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , in the last step of the analysis we fit the observations with a theoretical two - scale binomial multiplicative model @xcite to extrapolate the values of @xmath54 and @xmath53 and to obtain the degree of multifractality . + it is worth to noting that the agreement of the multifractal spectrum with the phenomenological intermittent two - scale model confirms that multifractal structures detected at small scales are generated by an intermittent cascade .",
    "moreover , the degree of multifractality calculated by using fitted two - scale model parameters ( @xmath57 ; for more details , see , e.g. @xcite ) measures inhomogeneity of the considered fluctuations and their deviation from a strict self - similarity .",
    "that is why @xmath58 is also a measure of intermittency , which is in contrast to self - similarity ( * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ f : w : sp ] presents an example of an @xmath22 multifractal spectrum obtained using the experimental values of the magnetic field strength for the fast solar wind measured by _",
    "ulysses _ in 2007 ( from january 22 to 28 ) at @xmath59 au and @xmath60 .",
    "the continuous line shows the @xmath22 spectrum derived from the theoretical two - scale model @xcite fitted with the observations ; the theoretical fit allows us to determine the width of the multifractal spectrum as the measure of multifractality ( intermittency ) , @xmath61 , as defined by eq .",
    "[ e : w : dm ] and discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 was computed for all selected time intervals during two solar minima ( 1997 - 1998 , 2007 - 2008 ) and maximum ( 1999 - 2001 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ f : w : rad ] and  [ f : w : lat ] .",
    "+ figure  [ f : w : rad ] suggests a slow evolution of intermittency in the fast and slow solar wind with the distance @xmath62 from the sun .",
    "the fast wind multifractal spectra seem to exhibit a small decrease of intermittency with the distance as @xmath63 .",
    "the rate of this decrease has been determined by the least squares linear fit to the log - log values of @xmath58 against @xmath62 to all points both from solar minimum and maximum ( figure [ f : w : rad]a ) . for the slow solar wind ( figure [ f : w : rad]b ) ,",
    "the evolution of intermittency with distance @xmath62 is more variable but anyway the decrease with distance with rate @xmath64 is observed anyway . + a latitudinal dependence of the multifractality of turbulence",
    "is also found , as illustrated in figure  [ f : w : lat ] .",
    "the fast solar wind at solar minimum exhibits a decrease in intermittency as the latitude increases ; the smallest values of multifractality are found near solar pole .",
    "another significant effect is the existence of a symmetry with respect to the ecliptic plane , observed mainly during solar minima ( 1997 - 1998 and 2007 - 2008 ) , which confirms previous observations @xcite .",
    "this is an indication that the fast polar solar wind has similar turbulent properties in the two hemispheres .",
    "we can not confirm this trend at solar maximum since the statistics of slow wind intervals in our database is rather poor and the solar wind is much more variable .",
    "+ the results denoted in figures  [ f : w : rad ] and  [ f : w : lat ] by blue circles correspond to solar minimum conditions ( 1997 - 1998 ) , heliocentric distances of the order of @xmath65 au , and heliographic latitudes smaller than @xmath66 . for this data subset , we observe that the level of multifractality is slightly lower for fast than for slow solar wind , with mean @xmath58 about @xmath67 ( compared to @xmath68 for the slow wind ) .",
    "these results are consistent with previous studies performed in the ecliptic plane @xcite and with previous analyses of _ ulysses _ data for the years 1992 - 1997 @xcite , which postulate that intermittency in the slow solar wind is higher than for the fast wind .",
    "+ results for the second minimum ( 2007 - 2008 ) , marked in figures  [ f : w : rad ] and  [ f : w : lat ] by black circles , seem to suggest somewhat different behavior .",
    "however , the data from this time interval have been collected for a wider range of latitudes , @xmath69 , and for a radial distance from the sun between @xmath70 and @xmath71 au .",
    "our hypothesis here is that the effect of change on solar wind multifractality with heliographic latitude may interfere with variations of this parameter observed with respect to the distance from the sun .",
    "the statistics of `` pure '' slow wind data is very poor ( only three intervals for 2007 - 2008 ) , correlated with the end of ulysses mission ; therefore , a comparison of the variation of multifractality between fast / slow wind and the solar cycle is not possible .",
    "+ in general , in the case of _ ulysses _ data , it is difficult to separate latitudinal and radial evolution of intermittency .",
    "the calculated multifractality as function of both heliocentric distance and heliographic latitude for the fast and slow solar wind are summarized in figures [ f : w : fast_slow]a and [ f : w : fast_slow]b , respectively .",
    "one may see that fluctuations of the magnetic field strength both in the fast and slow solar wind exhibit increased intermittent features at small distances from the sun .",
    "moreover , once again we see that at small heliolatitudes and at distance of about @xmath72 au , the slow wind is more intermittent than the fast .",
    "further , analysis of results presented in figures  [ f : w : rad ] and  [ f : w : lat ] shows a rather similar range of the degree of intermittency determined for the solar maximum and minimum .",
    "in other words , we have less dependence on the phases of solar activity than on the type of the solar wind @xcite .",
    "+ additionally , the multifractal analysis of _ ulysses _ magnetic field data presents a somewhat smaller degree of multifractality , @xmath73 , than those obtained previously for velocity fluctuations , @xmath74 @xcite . +",
    "in this letter , we have performed systematic studies of the multifractal and intermittent behavior of fluctuations of the interplanetary magnetic field strength for a broad range of heliographic latitudes , heliocentric distances , and for the maximum and minimum phase of the solar cycle .",
    "the obtained results can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the slow solar wind during solar minimum ( 1997 - 1998 ) , at distances of @xmath65 au and close to the equatorial plane , exhibits on average a higher level of intermittency than fast solar wind ; ( 2 ) the fast solar wind measured during the second minimum ( 2007 - 2008 ) , at distances of @xmath75 au and latitudes of @xmath76 reveals a decrease of intermittency ; ( 3 ) the level of intermittency during solar maximum present non - orderly behavior ; however , in many cases , we observe the same degree as those determined for data from solar minimum ; and ( 4 ) during solar minima ( 1997 - 1998 and 2007 - 2008 ) , similar intermittent properties of the fast polar solar wind in the two hemispheres are observed .",
    "+ generally , at small distances from the sun , both in the slow and fast solar wind , we observe the highest degree of multifractality , suggesting that most of the intermittent events have a solar origin .",
    "moreover , the level of intermittency seems to decrease also with latitude .",
    "this effect can be related to the fact that at radial distances of the order of 1 au and less , the solar wind turbulence is still developing ( see , e.g. , the structure function analysis of @xcite ) ; thus , the solar wind structures that contribute to intermittency have not reached statistical stationarity . at larger radial distances and higher heliolatitudes ,",
    "the turbulence is decaying as there are fewer  sources \" of turbulence than at low latitudes , like , e.g. , velocity stream shears .",
    "this hypothesis could be tested by investigation of _ ulysses _ data not included in this study .",
    "another effect that could possibly contribute to the decrease of intermittency with the radial distance is the inherent expansion of the structures involved in the intermittent transfer of energy ; their statistics would therefore decrease within the ranges of scales considered in this study .",
    "possible tests of this hypothesis could be provided by numerical simulations with an expanding solar wind .",
    "+ based on the investigations presented in this letter , we conclude that the evolution of `` pure '' slow and fast solar wind turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane is probably insufficient to maintain a high level of intermittency . while previous analyses of the radial evolution of solar wind intermittency were based on probability distribution functions and their moments , in this study we use the degree of multifractalality as a key descriptor .",
    "although the two approaches have similarities , they do not capture exactly the same aspects of solar wind fluctuations and scale behavior . in a future study",
    ", we will explore the consistency between the two approaches for the same data set .",
    "we would like to thank the swoops , swics , and mag instruments teams of the _ ulysses _ mission for providing data .",
