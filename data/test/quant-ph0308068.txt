    "the development of increasingly accurate atomic clocks has led to many advances in technology and tests of fundamental physics . in the search for the next generation of clocks and frequency standards ,",
    "there has been considerable interest in using alkaline earth species because of their narrow intercombination lines in the optical spectrum  @xcite . in order to achieve a high level of short - term stability and long - term reproducibility and accuracy on the clock transition ,",
    "it is desirable to have a large number of cold atoms located in a well - characterized trap for an improved signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0 ) and reduced systematic errors associated with atomic motion .",
    "single ion - based systems do effectively eliminate doppler and other motion - related systematic errors when the single ions are confined in the lamb - dicke regime  @xcite , although the achievable @xmath0 is limited by single quantum absorbers . for neutral atoms it is important that changes in the level structure due to the trapping potential do not alter the relevant clock transition frequency . such a scheme has been proposed by trapping alkaline earth atoms in three - dimensional optical lattices tuned to a  magic \" wavelength where the relevant states for the clock transition experience exactly the same level shift  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 forbidden transition ( @xmath2 nm ) in @xmath3sr  @xcite is in particular a promising candidate for a lattice - based optical clock transition because of the long lifetime of the excited state ( @xmath4 s ) and the insensitivity of the @xmath5 states to the polarization state of the trapping light .",
    "already there have been efforts towards the cooling and trapping of @xmath3sr  @xcite , and recently this transition was directly observed and measured for the first time  @xcite .",
    "calcium , another alkaline earth atom that has been studied extensively as a frequency standard  @xcite , may be a candidate for optical lattice clocks as well .    in the case of @xmath6 independent atoms , one benefits from a @xmath7 improvement in @xmath0 in spectroscopy .",
    "however , atoms trapped in an optical lattice can interact with each other and can not truly be considered independent .",
    "each optically excited atom represents essentially a point dipole whose radiated electromagnetic field can affect other atoms .",
    "these atom - atom interactions can manifest themselves as shifts in the observed transition frequencies . because of the spatial ordering of atoms in a lattice and the potentially high atomic density , it is possible that such interactions may produce very large frequency shifts .",
    "one might expect then that dipole - dipole interactions can be much more severe here than in , for example , atomic fountains , and thus could place serious limits on the accuracy of an optical lattice clock if not accounted for . on the other hand , it might be possible to design lattice geometries where this shift is reduced or cancelled .",
    "although the trapping lasers are constrained to operate at the  magic \" wavelength , the lattice geometry can be altered by changing the relative orientations of the trapping beams , whose degrees of freedom can be characterized by a set of variables @xmath8 .    in this paper , we investigate theoretically the dipole - dipole interaction - induced shifts in the clock transition frequency recovered by ramsey spectroscopy .",
    "we show that by varying the lattice geometry we can quantitatively control the clock frequency shift and even reduce the shift to zero .",
    "in particular , we give an analytical equation that can be solved giving configurations @xmath9 where constructive interference causes the line shift to be very large .",
    "in these  bad \" lattice configurations , the magnitude of the line shift scales approximately like @xmath10 .",
    "quite generally we propose that by tuning the parameter space @xmath8 to lie in between two of these bad configurations , one can find  good \" configurations where the shift is cancelled .",
    "the mechanism of cancellation is associated with the destructive interference of contributions to the shift from different atoms in the lattice .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the present mechanism and theoretical treatment differ considerably from the conventional approaches used to treat dipole - dipole line broadening and shifts . in the case of atoms in a spatially - ordered lattice geometry , long - range effects are important , and the usual methods involving binary collisions of nearest neighbors  @xcite are not applicable .",
    "these long - range effects include , in particular , interference of the far - field dipole radiation produced by the excited atoms , a phenomenon similar to bragg scattering in a crystal .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eqofmotion ] we derive equations describing the evolution of an atomic system with dipole - dipole interactions . these equations are derived assuming that the atoms are in the lamb - dicke regime , with one atom or less per lattice site . in sec .  [",
    "sec : ramsey ] we give a brief review of ramsey spectroscopy and solve for the dipole - dipole induced line shift using perturbation theory .",
    "we find that the shift can be qualitatively understood in terms of the classical interaction energies between oscillating dipoles .",
    "there is a contribution to the shift that is zeroth order in the interrogation time @xmath11 , which is due to imperfections in the ramsey pulses . even with perfect pulses , however",
    ", one finds a shift that is first order in @xmath11 that results from spontaneous decay of the atoms .",
    "[ sec : generalization ] discusses how our result for the line shift can be generalized for systems with imperfect filling of the lattice sites and for multilevel atoms . in the case of imperfect filling",
    ", one can calculate the mean value of the frequency shift as well as some nonzero variance , due to the uncertainty of how the lattice is filled . in sec .",
    "[ sec : latticedesign ] , we derive an equation that can be solved giving lattice configurations where the shift is large due to constructive interference .",
    "we derive an approximate scaling law for the shift in these  bad \" configurations and discuss how the line shift can be reduced by choosing an appropriate lattice design . in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] we demonstrate these results numerically for one specific lattice configuration .",
    "to treat the problem of interacting atoms in a lattice , we consider @xmath6 two - level atoms in the lamb - dicke limit with polarizability along the @xmath12-axis . a simple model of the system consists of treating the atoms as point dipoles , and we further assume that there is one or less atom per lattice site",
    ". this corresponds to a mott - insulator state for bosons or a normal state for fermions . in principle , to solve exactly the problem of interacting atoms one would start from the full atom - field hamiltonian and take into account not only all the atomic degrees of freedom but the continuum of electromagnetic field modes . to simplify the theoretical treatment ,",
    "we effectively eliminate the field in the standard way using the born - markov approximation  ( see appendix ) .",

    "( [ eq : dpdt ] ) , one can derive equations of motion for any atomic operators . for our particular application of ramsey spectroscopy",
    ", we find it necessary to solve for the coherence @xmath41 and the two - atom correlation @xmath42 .",

    "we now analyze the effects of atom - atom interactions on ramsey spectroscopy . starting from the ground state @xmath45 of the system ,",
    "suppose that one applies a strong probe pulse with the interrogating laser , given in the rotating frame by the hamiltonian h=^_ai(e^i_a - e^-i_a ) , where @xmath46 is the rabi frequency . for simplicity",

    "it should be noted that the line shift can be very large in one of these  bad \" configurations . even in the limit of short interrogation times",
    ", one can see that shifts of order @xmath145 are possible .",
    "this is perhaps a surprising result , and occurs because the spatial ordering of the atoms allows the interactions to behave constructively at these points . for longer interrogation times",
    ", one expects this line shift to become even larger , since the constructive interference in these configurations also leads to superradiant decay and thus a large contribution to the shift that is first order in @xmath11 .",

    "we have derived an expression for the line shift measured in ramsey spectroscopy due to dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we find that the lattice geometry strongly affects the magnitude of the shift , and is peaked in lattice configurations where the interactions between atoms add constructively . because of the spatial ordering in the lattice",
    ", the shift can be quite large in these resonant configurations . by tuning the lattice between two of these configurations",
    ", one can reduce the dipole - induced line shift to nearly zero .    while the resonant configurations might be bad for clock applications",

    "the dipole - dipole couplings in an optical lattice offer the possibility of strong , constructive interactions that can be dynamically tuned by changing the lattice geometry",

    "@xmath104 is the position of atom @xmath87 , and @xmath153 is the polarization direction of the dipoles .",
