    "rotation is a key parameter in stellar evolution , and is directly linked to many fundamental astrophysical processes , including magnetic field generation , stellar winds , star - disk interaction , and binary formation @xcite . because rotation drives magnetic activity , it is also relevant for space weather in the stellar surroundings and thus for planetary habitability @xcite .",
    "the rotation period , derived from the periodic photometric modulation induced by surface spots , is one of the rare stellar parameters that can be measured with high precision ( @xmath0% ) for large samples .",
    "large numbers of periods have been measured for low - mass stars with spectral types f to m of all ages from @xmath0myr to several gyrs , and they provide very useful constraints for angular momentum evolution models .",
    "other portions of the mass - age parameter space are still poorly explored .",
    "one example is the regime of bds , substellar objects with masses less than @xmath1 .",
    "the only regions with significant samples of measured bd periods are clusters in orion , the onc @xmath2ori , and @xmath3ori , at ages of 1 - 5myr . like stars , bds start with a range of periods from hours up to 5 - 10 days , and spin up due to pre - main sequence contraction , but in contrast to stars they maintain fast rotation with negligible spindown for several gyrs .    due to their intrinsic faintness , the small photometric amplitudes , and the wide range of periods at young ages",
    ", it is challenging to obtain a reliable picture of the rotational evolution of bds with ground - based observations alone , which feature typical daytime gaps and are therefore biased in the period sensitivity .",
    "there are good indications that disk braking is less efficient in the very low mass regime .",
    "but the lack of substantial and unbiased period samples for a range of ages prohibits us from putting firm constraints on models .",
    "here we present first period measurements for bds obtained with kepler s k2 mission @xcite . in campaign 2 ,",
    "the k2 field included large parts of the upper scorpius ( upsco ) star forming region ( age 5 - 10 myr ) , which harbours a huge population of bds . with a cadence of 30min and a time baseline of 72d ,",
    "the k2 lightcurves cover the entire period range for young bds . during the course of its mission",
    ", k2 is expected to fill the period - age diagram for bds with dozens of new datapoints ; this study is the first step towards a new census of bd rotation .",
    "we observed brown dwarfs in upsco as part of campaign 2 of the k2 mission .",
    "the targets were selected from the census by @xcite based on the ukidss survey .",
    "analysis of mid - infrared data shows that @xmath4% still harbour circum - sub - stellar disks .",
    "51 of the full sample of 116 have been covered by k2 .",
    "we downloaded the data , in the form of long - cadence target pixel files , from the mikulsi archive for space telescopes ( mast ) . to extract aperture photometry , detrend and correct for systematic effects we used the latest version of pyke @xcite",
    "this is an open - source pyraf package originally designed for custom manipulation of the _ kepler _ data and now also including the self - flat - fielding procedure of @xcite optimized for processing data from the k2 mission .",
    "the procedure utilizes the relation between the position of the target on the detector and the measured flux to correct for artifacts induced by the pointing drift of the spacecraft .",
    "our data reduction proceeds as follows .",
    "first we used pyke s _ kepmask _ to define sub - image apertures ( @xmath5 pixels ) from the respective target s postage stamp image ( typically @xmath6 pixels ) , then extract simple aperture photometry ( sap ) with _",
    "kepextract_. next , we detrend and normalize the raw lightcurves with _",
    "kepflatten _ using a low - order polynomial ( n  @xmath7 ) and , finally , to correct for the motion - induced systematic effects we use _ kepsff_. as an illustrative example , on fig .",
    "[ proc ] we show a section of the sap lightcurve ( background - corrected ) of epic204614722 ( top panel ) , the two moment centroids ( middle panels ) and the corresponding _ kepsff_-corrected lightcurve ( lower panel ) . throughout the data - reduction process",
    "we appropriately adjust the relevant input parameters on a target - by - target basis .",
    "we note that we used the entire campaign 2 dataset , including the majority of cadences from the second half of the campaign where most of the data flags are non - zero due to the photometer s local detector electronics parity errors , as these do not affect the quality of the data for the purposes of detecting rotational variability .",
    "all 51 lightcurves were visually inspected .",
    "16 of them show clear signs of periodic variability . in most cases",
    "the periodicity is obvious and periods ranging from a few hours up to 5d are estimated by eye . to measure the periods",
    ", we used the autocorrelation function , which has been established as a useful tool for period analysis in kepler lightcurves by @xcite . compared to fourier ( lomb - scargle ) or phase - based techniques ( e.g. , phase dispersion minimisation )",
    ", it has the advantage that it is robust against phase / amplitude changes as well as systematics .    after dividing the lightcurves in seven segments of 500 datapoints each , each covering about 10d with a uniform cadence of 30min",
    ", we calculate the autocorrelation function and determine the position of the first non - zero peak , which is a measurement of the fundamental period in the dataset . for 10 objects , we find a consistent period in all 7 segments , for 5 more the same period is found for 5 or 6 segments .",
    "the scatter in the individual period measurements is 1 - 8% , which we adopt as the uncertainty .",
    "one additional object shows an obvious @xmath8d period , but also strong additional variations , which could be intrinsic to the object , but might also be partly instrumental .",
    "the best periods and the uncertainties are listed in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the lightcurves are plotted in phase to the best period ( for the first 10 days of the campaign ) in fig .",
    "[ phase1 ] . for three targets not in table [ t1 ] , epic204367193 , epic204418005 , and epic204086791 .",
    "we discard these because the lightcurves , phase plots and autocorrelation functions do not look convincing",
    ". these could be residuals of the systematics and have to be re - examined when new software is available . ]",
    "+      +      +        to check for false positive signals due to contamination from other sources , we extracted the light curves of k2 stars near our targets as listed in mast ( typically much brigher , and within @xmath9 ) .",
    "we also tested various apertures on a target - by - target basis  from the central pixels , from the pixels surrounding them , and from any other conspicuously bright pixel in their respective postage stamp images  and visually examined the extracted light curves .",
    "our analysis indicates that the flux modulations in our targets light curves originate in their respective central pixels only .",
    "in addition , with the exception of mars moving across the detector containing our targets for a few days in october of 2014 , there are no obvious false positive sources .",
    "we also confirmed that the periods estimated here are also visible in the lightcurves made publicly available by @xcite .",
    "therefore we are convinced that the periods in table [ t1 ] are of astrophysical origin .",

    "the amplitudes of the lightcurves are typically a few percent , with the shape usually well approximated by a sinus curve .",
    "according to spectroscopy analysed in the literature , the objects with measured periods have spectral types of m5 to m7.5 and effective temperatures from 2500 to 3000k , corresponding to masses of 0.02 to 0.09@xmath11 .",
    "the majority of these objects are likely at the high end of this mass range . given that our targets are all mid to late m dwarfs and thus magnetically active objects , the most straightforward explanation for the periodicities",
    "are magnetically induced cool spots on the surface , which modulate the flux over a rotational cycle .",
    "therefore , we interpret the periods as rotation periods . for a more detailed discussion on the causes of periodic variability in very low mass objects , see .    for the other 35 objects in the sample we can not determine rotation rates .",
    "it is conceivable that the periods measured here are biased , particularly since we are using an activity phenomenon ( spots ) to derive periods , and activity may depend on rotation .",
    "ultimately this can only be tested by complementary , activity - independent measurements of rotation , such as spectroscopic @xmath12 . at this point",
    "there is no evidence for a bias in the photometric period samples ; the rotation - activity relation is flat in mid m dwarfs and so far @xmath12 have confirmed the fast rotation of very low mass objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , for the remainder of the paper we will assume that these periods are representative of young bds in upsco .",
    "the periods are persistent throughout the campaign , i.e. over at least 72d , with stable amplitudes .",
    "most objects show clear signs of phaseshift : if we plot the datapoints as function of phase for each of the segments , the maximum shifts through the observing campaign by 0.1 - 0.5 cycles over the course of 72d . comparing",
    "the phased lightcurve for various segments also shows in some cases indications for changes in the shape .",
    "thus , while the surfaces of our targets are continuously covered by spots , the parts of the surfaces that induce the variability change over time .",
    "this is evidence for evolving spot pattern on young bds . in one case ( epic204614722 )",
    "the period significantly decreases over the observing campaign , from 0.69d to 0.61d , most likely because the variability is induced by spots located at varying and differentially rotating latitudes .",
    "out of the 16 objects , 4 have mid - infrared colour excess indicating the presence of a disk ( class ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the remainder are disk - less based on their broadband colours ( class iii ) .",
    "one of the class ii sources , epic204344180 , shows a series of eclipses in the first part of its lightcurve ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] , left panel ) .",
    "the width and depth of the features vary slightly , and the eclipses disappear after about 20d .",
    "the dominant periodicity , however , persists over the entire lightcurve .",
    "this object might belong to the object class of aa - tau analogs , recently termed dippers , which show either regular or irregular eclipses , presumably caused by a wall at the inner edge of the disk @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the first example of a bd dipper. the fact that the rotation period of this object is consistent with the period of the eclipses indicates that the disk feature has to be near co - rotation radius .",
    "another one of the sources with disk , epic204078097 , has only insignificant colour excess at 3 - 5@xmath13 , but clearly exceeds the photospheric emission at 12@xmath13 , which makes this a bd transition disk .",
    "this object shows irregular amplitude changes throughout the observing campaign ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] , right panel ) , possibly due to short accretion bursts , maybe analogous to the ones reported for stars by @xcite and @xcite . as pointed out above , epic203348744 , another class ii object , features irregular variability which could at least partially be caused by accretion or the presence of a disk .",
    "the new periods for upsco bds give us an opportunity to probe the rotational evolution in the substellar regime . at ages of 1 - 20myr , stars spin up when angular momentum is conserved , because they contract towards their final main - sequence radii .",
    "angular momentum losses occur either due to magnetic star - disk coupling or accretion powered stellar winds @xcite . for a review of these processes and the observational evidence for disk braking , see @xcite    , width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ rotevo ] we compare the rotation periods in upsco presented in this paper ( table [ t1 ] ) with the two other sizable samples of bd periods , in the onc and @xmath2orid . ] and with simple rotational evolution tracks .",
    "the models are calculated based on the evolutionary models by , for a fiducial bd mass of 0.07@xmath14 .",
    "adopting a different mass ( 0.04 - 0.07@xmath14 ) shifts the tracks slightly .",
    "all tracks assume angular momentum conservation .",
    "we also overplot the physical barrier for the rotation period ( breakup period ) .    for @xmath2ori ,",
    "we combine the samples by and @xcite .",
    "we also include in the @xmath2ori sample the bd periods for the cluster around @xmath3ori , a poorly characterised region , but note that their inclusion does not change any of the following results . for the samples by and @xcite we adopt a magnitude cutoff of @xmath15 to separate bds from stars ; this is subject to uncertainties in evolutionary tracks and cluster distances . for the other two samples ,",
    "masses have been determined by comparing the ijhk photometry with evolutionary tracks in the original papers . in total",
    "we use 179 periods in the onc and 29 periods in @xmath2ori .",
    "we overplot the median and the 10% and 90% percentile .",
    "all samples should be sensitive to periods ranging from @xmath16 to several days , in the case of the k2 sample up to several weeks .",
    "the choice for the ages of @xmath2ori and upsco is relevant for the discussion . for @xmath2ori members the plausible age range is 3 - 6myr @xcite , for upsco 5 - 12myr @xcite .",
    "both regions are significantly older than the onc , and upsco is probably again significantly older than @xmath2ori . in fig .",
    "[ rotevo ] we choose ages of 4 and 8myr for @xmath2ori and upsco , respectively .",
    "age spread is probably present in both regions , but since ages for individual bds are not easily determined , this is neglected here .",
    "the median and percentiles for the upsco periods are slightly lower than in the onc , consistent with spinup due to contraction . compared with @xmath2ori ,",
    "the median and lower limit are actually slightly higher in upsco .",
    "we do not put too much emphasis on this finding at this point , since we can not be sure that we are not missing some of the ultrashort periods in the k2 lightcurves , which may have been removed together with systematics .",
    "the upper limit in upsco is lower than in @xmath2ori , mostly because @xmath2ori has a larger fraction of slow rotators with @xmath17 ( 8/29 vs. 1/16 ) .",
    "some of the periods in @xmath2ori and @xmath3ori are below or very close to the breakup period , this may have consequences on the rotational evolution , see discussion in .    from fig .",
    "[ rotevo ] it is evident that the current period census does not require any disk braking to explain the evolution of the period median and upper / lower limits .",
    "only ages at the upper end of the plausible range ( 6myr for @xmath2ori , 11myr for upsco ) may require to include some disk locking in the evolutionary tracks , but only for the slow rotators and only over a locking timescale of @xmath18myr .",
    "this is about about half as long as the locking timescale for slowly rotating low - mass stars .",
    "thus , independent of the choice of the ages , this analysis robustly demonstrates that disk braking is inefficient in the bd regime .",
    "this is consistent with earlier findings of moderate angular momentum loss in very low mass stars , by .",
    "it is notable that the four objects with disk in the upsco sample are among the six slowest rotators , with periods of 1.4 , 1.7 , 1.8d , and 5d well above the median .",
    "this indicates that disk braking does have some effect , but only for very few objects and/or on short timescales .",
    "we have measured a sample of rotation periods for young brown dwarfs in the upsco region , using lightcurves from campaign 2 of the k2 mission .",
    "our periods range from a few hours up to 5d , with a median just above one day , confirming that bds , except at the youngest ages , are fast rotators .",
    "four of the slowest rotators have mid - infrared excess emission due to the presence of a disk ; at least two of them show signs of disk eclipses and accretion in the lightcurves .",
    "we compare the new periods with previously published samples in the onc and @xmath2ori and show that the period evolution from 1 to 10myr is consistent with no or little rotational braking , in contrast to low - mass stars .",
    "this confirms that disk braking , while still at work , is inefficient in the bd regime .",
    "this main finding is potentially an important constraint on the mass dependence of the braking mechanism .",
    "compared with low - mass stars , young bds have much lower accretion rates , weak magnetic fields @xcite , and possibly lower ionisation rates at the inner edge of the gas disk .",
    "these characteristics may influence the efficiency of rotational braking .",
    "we thank thomas barclay for his assistance with pyke and andrew vanderburg for a fruitful discussion on the details of his data reduction technique .",
    "this work was supported in part by nserc grants to r. jayawardhana .",
    "this work made use of pyke @xcite , a software package for the reduction and analysis of kepler data .",
