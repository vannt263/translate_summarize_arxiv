    "the obscuring effects of dust and high stellar density in the milky way have historically prevented the detection of galaxies that lie behind the disk of our galaxy .",
    "this zone of avoidance ( zoa ) typically comprises more than 20% of the optical extragalactic sky and nearly 10% of the infrared extragalactic sky , although recent surveys have begun to lessen its extent .",
    "the presence of the zoa does not affect extragalactic population studies , as galaxies in the highly obscured zoa should not differ from those detected in regions of low obscuration .",
    "a complete census of galaxies across the galactic plane is necessary , however , to fully understand the dynamics of the local group as well as the large - scale structure of the local universe .",
    "many early zoa studies focused on finding a highly obscured , nearby , massive galaxy .",
    "several such galaxies have been found , including maffei  1  and  2 ( maffei 1968 ) , circinus ( freeman et al . 1977 ) , and dwingeloo 1 ( kraan - korteweg et al . 1994 ) . while the ic  342/maffei group and other nearby massive galaxies largely define the motion of the local group , the direction of the local group acceleration is strongly affected by the full zoa mass distribution out to 6000  km  s@xmath5 ( kolatt , dekel , & lahav 1995 ) , and possibly beyond .",
    "several attempts have been made in recent years to sample the zoa more completely .",
    "optical galaxy candidates have been identified by searches of the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) prints and schmidt atlases ( see kraan - korteweg & lahav 2000 for a review ) .",
    "highly obscured galaxies have also been detected in the near - infrared ( nir ) and far - infrared by the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; schrder , kraan - korteweg , & mamon 1999 ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the infrared astronomical satellite sky survey ( iras , e.g. nakanishi et al .",
    "1997 ) .    while useful in reducing the size of the zoa , optical and infrared surveys are ultimately limited by galactic extinction and source confusion .",
    "the most thorough optical searches are complete to an apparent diameter of @xmath9 and a magnitude of b@xmath10 at extinctions of @xmath11 ( kraan - korteweg 2000 , woudt & kraan - korteweg 2001 ) .",
    "the dirbe/_iras _ 100  @xmath12 m extinction maps ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) directly measure the dust column density and indicate that @xmath13 for 9.5% of the sky , although the data in the galactic plane are not yet well - calibrated .",
    "the completeness of infrared surveys of the zoa is affected primarily by source confusion .",
    "results from the denis survey indicate that nir surveys can easily detect galaxies down to @xmath14  mag , and the brighter ones far beyond ( schrder et al .",
    "the 2mass survey is expected to be complete to @xmath15 at 2.2  @xmath12 m for the majority of the sky , but for @xmath16 , this completeness drops to @xmath17 ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "hi emission is not affected by the dust in the milky way .",
    "consequently , blind hi surveys provide a unique means by which to identify gas - rich zoa galaxies .",
    "the first blind zoa hi survey was conducted by henning ( 1992 ) using the green bank 300-ft telescope .",
    "more recent blind hi surveys include the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs , rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) and the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss , zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ) , which intersect with but do not focus on the zoa .",
    "the first systematic hi survey to focus on the optically most opaque part of the zoa is the dwingeloo obscured galaxies survey ( henning et al .",
    "1998 , rivers 2000 ) which sampled the northern zoa ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) to velocities of 4000  km  s@xmath5 in the local group standard of rest with an rms of 40  mjy  beam@xmath5 .",
    "each of these surveys has contributed to our understanding of gas - rich galaxies and the structure of the local universe , but all have been limited in either sensitivity or sky coverage .    the 21-cm multibeam receiver ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1996 ) on the parkes 64-m telescope is the first instrument capable of conducting both sensitive _ and _ large - area blind hi surveys in a reasonable time .",
    "two multibeam surveys commenced in 1997 .",
    "the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass , see meyer et al .",
    "2004 ) is a blind hi survey of the sky south of @xmath20 and has an rms noise of 13  mjy  beam@xmath5 .",
    "the hi parkes zone of avoidance survey is a more sensitive ( rms = 6 mjy  beam@xmath5 ) survey of the region of the milky way accessible from parkes ( @xmath21 to @xmath1 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "an analysis of shallower data for the southern zoa ( rms = 15  mjy  beam@xmath5 , @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) led to the discovery of 110 galaxies , 67 of which were previously unknown ( henning et al .",

    "@xmath25 ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) .",
    "the results reported here are , however , at full survey sensitivity ( rms = 6  mjy  beam@xmath5 ) .",
    "although this region overlaps with the dwingeloo survey , the parkes survey is much more sensitive and represents the first probe , beyond a few mpc , of this region of the universe , which lies near both the local and microscopium voids .",
    "data of similar depth for the remainder of the zoa ( @xmath26 to @xmath24 ) will be reported elsewhere .    in  2",
    ", we describe the observations and the method by which the data were reduced .",
    "the galaxy search method , measurement of hi parameters , search results , and survey completeness are discussed in  3 . in  4 , we describe the results of a search for multiwavelength counterparts to the survey galaxies .",
    "the large - scale structures revealed by the survey are discussed in  5 , and the mass function of the galaxies is discussed in  6 . throughout the paper , we assume @xmath27  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the observations for the northern extension of the hi parkes zoa survey began in 2000 october and were completed in 2002 may .",
    "the data were taken at the parkes 64-m telescope using the 21-cm multibeam receiver , which consists of an array of 13 beams each with two orthogonal linear polarizations and an average beamwidth of @xmath28 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the multibeam correlator has a bandwidth of 64  mhz and covers the velocity range @xmath29  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the channel spacing is 13.2  km  s@xmath5 and the average system temperature is 20k .",
    "the northern zoa region referred to in this paper lies at declinations @xmath30 and is divided into four fields , each approximately @xmath31 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "each field was scanned 425 times , with a single @xmath32 scan covering a region @xmath33 wide in eight minutes .",
    "the central beam for all scans lies along a line of constant galactic latitude , with each of the 425 scans being separated by 14 in latitude . at the midpoint of each scan , the feed angle is @xmath34 with respect to the scan direction so that all 13 beams lie at different latitudes in a minimally redundant fashion .",
    "the total integration time is 2100  s  beam@xmath5 .",
    "the median rms noise of the four fields after hanning smoothing is 6.0  mjy  beam@xmath5 .    the data were bandpass - corrected , doppler - corrected , and calibrated using aips++ livedata ( barnes et al .",
    "gridding was performed by gridzilla , using a top - hat median gridding algorithm with a top - hat radius of 6@xmath35 ( barnes et al .",
    "the resulting pixel and beam sizes are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "spectral ringing associated with galactic hi emission and the baseline ripple associated with strong continuum emission were respectively removed or suppressed using hanning smoothing and the scaled template method ( see barnes et al .",
    "hanning smoothing increases the velocity resolution to 27  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "several sources of extraneous signal remained after standard processing .",
    "residual baseline ripples caused by continuum radio sources are the most prominent",
    ". hydrogen recombination lines at 1424.734 mhz ( h166@xmath38 ) , 1399.368 mhz ( h167@xmath38 ) , and 1374.601 mhz ( h168@xmath38 ) appear at velocities of cz=-911  km  s@xmath5 , 4507  km  s@xmath5 , and 9990  km  s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "interference from the l3 beacon of the gps near 1380 mhz ( 8778  km  s@xmath5 ) is also present .",
    "these sources of interference can generally be identified by their characteristic frequencies and widths . in the case of recombination lines , they are accompanied by continuum emission from their underlying hii regions .",
    "the four hanning - smoothed data cubes were visualized using kview in the software package karma ( gooch 1995 ) and were searched by eye ; the strong residual baseline ripples prevented the use of automatic galaxy - finding software .",
    "the galaxy search was conducted over the full velocity range , @xmath39  km  s@xmath5 , although confusion from galactic emission prevented a complete survey of the region with @xmath40  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "all possible planes , ra - dec , ra - velocity , and dec - velocity were examined by three independent parties and a final galaxy list was decided upon by a fourth author .      the coordinates and spectral characteristics of each galaxy",
    "were measured using the program mbspect in the software package miriad ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) .",
    "the galaxy positions were determined by spatially fitting a gaussian to the velocity - integrated emission of each galaxy .",
    "we subsequently used this position in the spectral analysis , where the weighted sum of the emission in each velocity plane was used to form the spectral profile .",
    "the total flux was measured by integrating the flux over the galaxy profile .",
    "the systemic velocity was taken to be the midpoint of the profile at 50% of the peak flux .",
    "the widths at 20% and 50% of the peak flux density were measured using a width - maximizing technique . due to the large hanning - smoothed velocity resolution of 27  km  s@xmath5 ,",
    "the velocity widths we measure are broader than the intrinsic widths of the galaxies .",
    "the velocity widths at the 20% and 50% peak flux levels were therefore corrected by 21 and 14  km  s@xmath5 , respectively ( see henning et al .",
    "2000 ) . if the hi emission showed no evidence of extension or confusion , we analyzed a region 28@xmath35 around the galaxy . for seven of the galaxies , a narrower box of width 12@xmath35 or 20@xmath35 was used to isolate the galaxy emission from that arising from a neighboring galaxy , which may have led to an underestimation of the total flux . while no galaxies in our survey are clearly extended",
    ", we did identify one galaxy that is possibly extended or confused , j1912 + 02 .",
    "the spectral fitting for this galaxy was conducted by summing the emission over a @xmath41 box .",
    "the position was fit over a smaller @xmath42 box .",
    "where possible , a first - order baseline was fit to each profile . for approximately half of the galaxies , however , baseline ripples made a first - order fit unrealistic ; for these galaxies , we used the lowest order baseline that gave a reasonable fit .",
    "the distance to each galaxy , @xmath43 , was calculated using its velocity in the local group standard of rest , @xmath44  sin@xmath45  cos@xmath46 .",
    "the hi mass was determined using @xmath47 = 2.36\\times10^{5 } d^{2 } f_{\\rm hi}$ ] , where @xmath48 is the distance in mpc and @xmath49 is the integrated hi flux in jy  km  s@xmath5 .    to estimate the errors on the hi parameters",
    ", we conducted a set of simulations .",
    "each galaxy profile was first smoothed using a savitzky - golay smoothing filter ( press et al .",
    "1992 , sec .",
    "this least - squares polynomial filter reduces noise while better retaining the higher - order characteristics of the spectrum than traditional smoothing techniques .",
    "fifty simulated spectra were then created for each galaxy by adding random poisson noise to the smoothed galaxy spectrum ; the rms of this random noise was set equal to that of the original galaxy spectrum .",
    "the errors on the hi parameters were then taken to be the median absolute offsets between the parameters of the 50 simulated spectra , as measured by mbspect , and those of the smoothed galaxy profile .",
    "the median errors on the peak and integrated flux for the entire sample of galaxies are approximately 9% and 4% , respectively .",
    "the median error on the systemic velocity is 3  km  s@xmath5 and the median errors on the 50% and 20% velocity widths are 8  km  s@xmath5 and 10  km  s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we note that the error we quote for the integrated flux does not take into account the uncertainty due to baseline subtraction or the uncertainty in calibration ; the total errors on the integrated flux are likely to be @xmath50 10 - 15% .",
    "we further discuss this method and the dependence of the estimated errors on s / n in appendix a.      77 definite or probable galaxies were detected , 35 in the @xmath0 to @xmath1 region and 42 in the @xmath2 to @xmath3 region . because adjacent data cubes extend slightly beyond the @xmath31 boundaries and overlap in galactic longitude , 5 galaxies were initially detected twice . of these",
    ", the detection located within the well defined @xmath31 region of a cube was chosen for the final list .",
    "the hi properties of the 77 galaxies are presented in table 1 .",
    "the hi spectra of a subset of the sample are shown in figure 2 ; the complete set of spectra is available in the electronic edition of the journal .",
    "the set of dotted lines nearest the galaxy spectrum defines the region in which the galaxy profile was measured .",
    "a second set of more widely spaced dotted lines indicate the region over which the baseline was fit .",
    "if no second set is present , the baseline fit was applied to the entire region displayed .",
    "all velocities are given in the optical convention , @xmath51 .    for several galaxies ,",
    "a highly variable baseline prevents a convincing spectrum from being attained although the galaxy is clearly present in the data cube . as an example , consider j0623 + 14 , a galaxy that was detected despite its superposition on one of the most extreme ripples that remain in the survey data . coincidentally ,",
    "j0623 + 14 has previously been observed by arecibo in an hi follow - up survey of weinberger galaxies ( pantoja et al .",
    "despite the extremely poor baseline we observe , our hi parameters are in satisfactory agreement with the arecibo hi parameters . the arecibo flux is higher than what we detect by 14% and the peak flux density is lower by 22% .",
    "the most significant difference between our hi properties and those derived from the arecibo observation is the 50% velocity width ; we measure a value of 286  km  s@xmath5 whereas pantoja et al .",
    "measure 411  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the identification of confused and marginally extended galaxies in our sample is difficult .",
    "we expect most normal galaxies to be unresolved in the parkes beam at the typical distances in this survey , although confusion in the parkes beam is not unlikely .",
    "the hi profile is the best indicator of a confused signal , although a profile can be intrinsically asymmetric , and minor contributions to the hi profile often do not disturb the profile greatly .",
    "a possible confusion in the detection can be confirmed by the relative positions and distances of the potential optical and ir counterparts , although background galaxies and hi - poor counterparts make this difficult , as does the high extinction in the zoa .",
    "the unambiguous identification of confused galaxies can therefore only be made by high - resolution follow - up observations .",
    "the mass distribution of the survey galaxies is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the hi masses range from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , with a mean mass of @xmath54 .",
    "the distributions of velocities in the local group ( solid line ) and heliocentric ( dotted line ) standards of rest are shown in figure 4 . by using the local group standard of rest ,",
    "we remove the effect of the milky way s velocity within the local group from our velocity and distance determinations .",
    "as we are interested in large - scale structures outside of the local group , we feel that this is the more appropriate standard of rest .",
    "both the velocities in the local group and heliocentric standards of rest have been plotted in figure 4 , however , for comparison .",
    "distinct peaks can be seen at local group standard of rest velocities near 3250  km  s@xmath5 , 4750  km  s@xmath5 , and 6750  km  s@xmath5 in the @xmath0 to @xmath1 region which seem to be due to filaments crossing the galactic plane at those velocities ( see also fig .",
    "the first of these peaks seems to be due to the boundary of the local void .",
    "the velocity distribution for the @xmath2 to @xmath3 region seems smoother overall , except for the curious gap around 4500  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "as will be discussed in  5 , this structure may be due to the wall of the canis major void .      of the 77 galaxies detected in this survey , three have systemic velocities of @xmath55  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the newly detected galaxy hizoa j0630 + 08 ( @xmath6 = 203.1,0.9 ) has a velocity of only @xmath56 km  s@xmath5 ( see table 1 ) and could be a high velocity cloud , though its isolation and relative compactness suggest it is more likely a nearby dwarf galaxy .",
    "the galactic extinction towards this galaxy is @xmath57 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "hizoa j0630 + 08 may be part of the orion group ( giovanelli & haynes 1981 ) whose known members are the orion dwarf ( @xmath6 = 200.6 , 12.3 ) , the irregular galaxy 0554 + 07 ( @xmath6 = 200.0 , 8.4 ) , the dwarf irregular galaxy cgcg  422003 ( @xmath6 = 198.8 , 12.2 ) and ugc  03303 ( @xmath6 = 198.6 , 16.9 ) . their velocities are cz = 365 , 411 , 441 and 521 km  s@xmath5 , respectively ( giovanelli 1979 , giovanelli & haynes 1981 , michel & huchra 1988 , thuan & seitzer 1979 ) .",
    "karachentsev & musella ( 1996 ) give distances of @xmath58 mpc ( orion dwarf ) and @xmath59 mpc ( 0554 + 07 ) assuming galactic extinctions of 2.7 and 2.9 mag , respectively . at a distance of 6 mpc the hi mass of hizoa j0630",
    "+ 08 would be @xmath60 .",
    "further investigations of the orion group and surroundings are under way .",
    "in addition to hizoa j0630 + 08 , we detect two other nearby galaxies , hizoa j1940 + 11 and hizoa j1914 + 10 , with systemic velocities of 580  km  s@xmath5 and 654  km  s@xmath5 , respectively . for hizoa j1914 + 10 we derive an hi mass of @xmath61 m@xmath62 .",
    "this galaxy was previously detected in the dwingeloo obscured galaxies survey and is known as dw044.80.5 ( henning et al .",
    "1998 , rivers 2000 ) .",
    "the galactic extinction in this direction is extremely high , preventing detection of optical or infrared counterparts .    for hizoa j1940 + 11 , a newly cataloged galaxy ,",
    "we derive an hi mass of only @xmath63 m@xmath62 .",
    "confirmation of this hi detection would be desirable as it is very weak and found at the edge of our survey field .",
    "the galactic extinction in this direction is @xmath64 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "both hizoa j1940 + 11 and hizoa j1914 + 10 appear isolated , in contrast to hizoa j0630 + 08 , and lie in the outskirts of the local void .",
    "our ability to detect a galaxy in the survey depends on both its integrated flux and velocity width . a galaxy with a high total flux and a small to moderate velocity width can be identified most easily ; decreasing a galaxy s flux or increasing its velocity width would generally make detection more difficult . this , and previous experience with hi surveys ( e.g. kilborn et al . 2002 ) , leads us to expect the survey to be approximately mean flux limited , where mean flux is defined here to be the integrated flux divided by the 20% velocity width ( or the 50% velocity width in cases where the 20% width is not available ) .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by plotting the number of survey galaxies with a given flux , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is defined to be the mean , integrated , or peak flux density .",
    "we find that @xmath65 declines most steeply at low fluxes , and therefore best defines the flux cutoff , when the flux is taken to be the mean flux density .",
    "a plot of @xmath65 against @xmath66 is shown in fig.5 , with @xmath66 representing the mean flux density as above .",
    "it is consistent with a euclidean power law , @xmath67 , and a mean flux density completeness limit of 0.022 jy , assuming approximate spatial homogeneity .",
    "the best - fit linear relationship between the mean flux density and peak flux density of galaxies in the survey has a slope of 0.75 .",
    "the above completeness limit therefore corresponds roughly to a peak flux density completeness limit of 0.029  jy , which is @xmath68 above the rms noise of the survey , 6.0  mjy .    in figure 6 ,",
    "we plot as a solid histogram the area of the survey , @xmath69 , at or below a given rms noise , @xmath66 .",
    "the number of galaxies detected at or below a given rms noise is also given as a dotted histogram .",
    "we conservatively define the effective area of the survey to be the area with an rms noise at or below 0.0073  jy , 239  deg@xmath70 . inside this area",
    ", the limiting mean flux density of the survey , 0.022  jy , corresponds to a 3@xmath71 , or higher , detection ( corresponding to 5@xmath71 , or higher , in peak flux density ) .",
    "this area is less than the nominal survey area of @xmath72 deg@xmath73 partly because of edge effects , and partly because of the increased continuum ( particularly residual continuum ripple ) along the galactic plane .    to investigate the effect of the variable rms , we divide the survey into three regions of equal area , but of different rms noise .",
    "we again plot @xmath65 against @xmath66 for each of the three regions and fit the differential number counts with a euclidean power law .",
    "we estimate completeness limits of 0.019 , 0.020 and 0.026  jy for the regions of low , medium , and high rms noise , respectively .",
    "as expected , the completeness limit increases with rms noise . however , the variation is sufficiently limited that , for the present purposes , a mean completeness limit of 0.022  jy adequately characterizes the survey .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that , in addition to good completeness above a mean flux density of 0.022  jy , this survey is expected to be highly reliable .",
    "galaxy identifications were made by three authors independently , and the final galaxy list was made by a fourth author in a conservative manner , guided by experience gained from follow - up observations of surveys with similar noise characteristics ( henning et al .",
    "2000 , zwaan et al .",
    "we expect that very few , if any , of the new galaxies presented here will be false detections , and therefore the reliability of the catalog to be close to 100% .",
    "ultimately , however , follow - up hi observations of some weaker objects will be required to ensure that no false detections remain .",
    "the region of sky covered by the northern zoa survey overlaps slightly with a number of other surveys . these include four blind hi surveys , the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs ; rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) , the pilot nrao 300-ft telescope survey ( henning 1992 ) , the dwingeloo obscured galaxy survey ( dogs ; henning et al .",

    "2000 ) , although the overlap with the hizss is extremely small .",
    "this region also coincides with a number of hi follow - up surveys and several optical surveys , from which the zoag ( see lercher , kerber , & weinberger 1996 ) , cgmw ( see roman , iwata , & saito 2000 ) , wein ( weinberger 1980 ) , and additional catalogs have been compiled .",
    "significant infrared coverage of these regions has been provided by iras and 2mass .",
    "we searched for hi , optical , and infrared counterparts to the northern zoa galaxies using two methods .",
    "we first used the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) , and the iras point source catalog ( psc ) to conduct an automated search for the _ nearest _ potential counterparts to each hi galaxy .",
    "the fraction of these counterparts likely to be associated with the hi galaxies was estimated by a simulation , described in appendix b. our second approach was to determine the most likely counterparts by searching for and visually inspecting all potential optical and infrared counterparts , including ( 1 ) counterparts located further from the hi position than those chosen by our previous search and ( 2 ) previously unidentified galaxies in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) poss - ii near - infrared , red , and blue images .",
    "any galaxy visible in the dss bands was classified by us as an optical detection .",
    "the visual search is , of course , subject to error ; we have tried to minimize this error by having multiple authors participate in the choice of counterparts .",
    "previous investigations of the offset between parkes hi sources and their counterparts ( see juraszek et al . 2000 , koribalski et al . 2004 , ryan - weber et al .",
    "2002 ) indicate that while most counterparts are found within @xmath74 , offsets as high as @xmath75 are not highly unusual .",

    "20 have been detected previously in hi .",

    "both were previously observed as part of the arecibo dual beam survey . the small adbs flux for hizoa j0622 + 11b",
    "can potentially be explained by the fact that adbs flux measurements were underestimated if the source was offset from the beam center ( see rosenberg and schneider 2000 ) .",
    "we are confident in our fits to both galaxies , and are unable to explain the large positive flux offset of hizoa j0654 + 08 .",
    "two of the remaining galaxies for which our flux is significantly higher than that in the literature were identified by the dwingeloo obscured galaxies survey .",
    "both have strong clean profiles .",
    "the discrepancies in flux most likely arise from the conservative way in which the dwingeloo galaxy fluxes were measured ( rivers ( 2000 ) defined the total integrated flux to be the flux inside the @xmath78  @xmath79 contour ) .",

    "figure a2(c ) illustrates the differences between the errors derived from the simulated profiles and those estimated from the template .",
