    "screening in semiconductor nanocrystals is a fundamental issue , the importance of which is mostly due to the large amount of technological applications inherent in the world of nanostructures . while screening in bulk semiconductors is a well known and widely investigated subject , @xcite the phenomenon of screening in nanostructures is still not fully understood .",
    "the presence of many papers recently published on this subject shows that there is a strong interest in this field .",
    "@xcite in particular , it has been shown that the response of a nanostructure to an external field is bulklike well inside the structure .",
    "@xcite this is an interesting feature due to the local nature of bonding in semiconductors . on the other hand ,",
    "such a behavior is quite different from the trend shown , in both experimental results and theoretical calculations , by the nanocrystal macroscopic dielectric constant,@xcite that is shown to increase quite slowly with the size upon going from small nanocrystals to the bulk .",
    "the connection between the microscopic local , bulk - like response and the macroscopic dielectric properties can be understood only through the study of the surface polarization contribution , which strongly influences the nanocrystal properties .",
    "preliminary results on this subject have been presented in ref . .",
    "in the present paper , we investigate the nature of the screening in semiconductor nanocrystals by performing a detailed microscopic analysis . in the first part of the paper ,",
    "a first - principles study of shallow impurity screening in nanocrystals is described . the charge density induced by donors and acceptors in si and ge nanocrystals",
    "is discussed , pointing to the connections to both the point - charge case and the bulk limit .",
    "it is shown that , just like in bulk semiconductors,@xcite the response to isocoric impurities in nanocrystals is similar to that of a point - charge .",
    "a description of the local field effects on the induced charge is given showing that the present real - space analysis gives a way to distinguish between surface and bond polarization contributions .",
    "in particular , a very interesting comparison with the work of ref . allows us to give a physical interpretation of the various contributions to the screening .    in the second part of the paper , a model for the screening",
    "is proposed .",
    "the well known electrostatic model , based on the image charge method,@xcite is not valid in the neighborhood of the impurity , in that wrong boundary conditions are given for the induced potential .",
    "we propose a generalization to semiconductor nanocrystals of the thomas - fermi model as originally proposed in ref . for bulk semiconductors .",
    "in order to better appreciate the merits and the shortcomings of the thomas - fermi theory , an alternative derivation of the model from the hohenberg and kohn theorem @xcite is described . in the present model , both the correct limit in the neighborhood of the impurity and",
    "the surface polarization contributions are taken into account from the beginning as boundary conditions of the poisson equation .",
    "our results fit well the screening diagonal contribution @xcite for bulk silicon , and excellent agreement with a recent first - principles calculation of the screening function @xcite is obtained .",
    "moreover , the model gives a fair prediction of the impurity binding energies .",
    "we have performed _ ab initio _ calculations using different kinds of impurities in si and ge nanocrystals .",
    "the study has been based on a plane - wave density - functional theory ( dft ) framework .",
    "the calculations have been done with the quantum - espresso package,@xcite using the general gradient approximation with ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite a vacuum space of at least @xmath0  has been left within the supercell , in order to avoid spurious interactions between a nanocrystal and its replicas .",
    "the convergence with respect to the plane - wave basis - set cutoff has been treated with care , and makov - payne corrections @xcite have been added for the computation of the charged nanocrystal total energies .",
    "the nanocrystals have a nearly spherical shape , they are centered on a si ( ge ) atom , and the surface dangling bonds are saturated with hydrogen atoms .",
    "the undoped structures have been relaxed , and the optimized geometries used for the doped structures . in this way we study the screening due to the electronic response to an external perturbation , where fixed ionic positions are considered .",
    "the resulting screening does not take into account the contribution due to the ionic displacement .",
    "this latter is negligible when covalent semiconductors are considered .",
    "the electron density induced by a donor species @xmath1 in the nanocrystal si@xmath2h@xmath3 is given by @xmath4 -n\\left [ \\mathrm{si}_{l}\\mathrm{h}_{m}\\right ] , \\label{eq : indchorig}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the impurity net charge ( atomic units are used throughout this work ) .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] it is seen that , in the case of the acceptors al@xmath15 and mg@xmath16 ( circles and stars ) , apart from a narrow region of space near the impurity ( inside the pseudopotential core , the acceptor curves show a nonlinear peak that is absent in the donor case ) , the overall structure is similar to the donor case .",
    "however , while in the region of space after the second main peak from the impurity the curve is very similar to the donor case , the first main peak is lower and pushed away from the impurity site @xmath17 .",

    "[ fig : fig2](b ) we also report ( stars ) a previous _ ab initio _ result obtained using a truly point - charge impurity for computing the linear - response screening in bulk ge.@xcite it is evident that the screening near the impurity is much more pronounced for the nonisocoric p@xmath14 impurity than for the isocoric as@xmath14 .",
    "the different core of the dopant atom with respect to the host atom gives rise , in the first case , to the so called central cell corrections , which give a nonlinear contribution . on the other hand , the response to ( isocoric ) as@xmath14 impurity does not induce central cell corrections",
    "it should be pointed out that these corrections have a finite range , being especially pronounced in the region of space before the second main peak in the @xmath10 curve . instead , the electron charge localized on the surface is quite independent of the chemical shift .",

    "further considerations can be driven from panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in ref .",
    ", it was shown for bulk ge that the induced charge density [ stars in fig [ fig : fig2](b ) ] receives contributions from both diagonal and off - diagonal terms of the dielectric matrix in reciprocal space . the diagonal contribution to the integrated density consists in a monotonic increase of @xmath10 , followed by constant value .",
    "instead , the off - diagonal contribution , related to the so called local field effects , gives a wavy structure to the integrated induced density .",
    "this undulating behavior has been discussed by several authors for bulk systems , and arises from the polarization of the bonds.@xcite both the diagonal and off - diagonal contributions are retrieved for the nanocrystals , as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , but an additional effect due to the polarization of the surface emerges .",
    "it consists of an electron density accumulation around the nanocrystal surface due to the dielectric nature of the structure , as is well known from classical electrostatics .",
    "the surface polarization is retrieved from the present _ ab initio _ formulation and can be seen as a very special kind of local field effect causing the annihilation of @xmath10 in correspondence with the nanocrystal boundary [ figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) and [ fig : fig2](a ) ] .",
    "we conclude that in a nanocrystal , local field effects ( i.e. , not diagonal contributions ) show up as both the bond and the surface polarization .",
    "nonetheless , while the bond polarization , which is a bulk effect , gives a negligible contribution to the screening and the optical properties , the surface polarization is extremely important .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] , where the spherical average of the induced density [ panel a ] and the integrated density [ panel b ] are shown for a set of p@xmath14-doped silicon nanocrystals with increasing radii .",
    "it comes out that up to a distance of a few a.u . from the impurity ,",
    "both the induced and the integrated densities are almost independent of the nanocrystal size . in order to be more quantitative , it is necessary to define the nanocrystal radius .",
    "we do not follow the standard route , that is , the radius of sphere whose volume equals the product of the volume per atom in the bulk times the number of , say , silicon atoms .",
    "indeed , the shortcoming of this definition is that the hydrogens passivating the surface are left out .",
    "moreover , in a screening problem the fundamental objects are the electrons , including those participating in the bonds near the surface . on the basis of these arguments",
    ", we define the nanocrystal radius through the equation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the bulk valence electron density and @xmath38 is the total number of valence electrons in si@xmath2h@xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : fig3](a ) , with the present definition all the radii lie almost exactly in the middle of the surface charge density . as a final observation ,",
    "we stress that despite the undulation in both the induced and integrated densities , the total induced charge around the impurity is almost independent of the nanocrystal radius .",
    "although , at this level , this concept may not appear to be well - defined , we shall see in the next section how it allows the construction of a thomas - fermi model for the screening .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the density induced by a point - charge impurity in semiconductor nanocrystals consists of several contributions . the first contribution is due to the reciprocal - space diagonal part of the dielectric matrix , the second contribution comes from the si - si bond polarization , and the third is from the nanocrystal surface polarization . in this section ,",
    "we illustrate a thomas - fermi model , which reproduces with great accuracy both the diagonal and surface polarization contributions .      as a starting step ,",
    "we briefly describe a simple electrostatic model that can be used as a first approximation in studying point - charge screening in semiconductor nanocrystals .",
    "the basic assumption is that , as a response to a point - charge potential @xmath41 , an electron polarization charge @xmath42 is induced around the impurity . on the other hand ,",
    "since the total induced charge must integrate to zero , a compensating charge @xmath43 , assumed as uniformly distributed on the nanocrystal surface , must be introduced .",
    "the resulting potential energy is therefore due to a total charge @xmath44 localized around the impurity , and to a charge @xmath43 distributed on the surface . from electrostatics , the potential energy for an electron is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the nanocrystal radius , as defined in the previous section .",
    "this electrostatic model is supported by the dft results described in the previous section .",
    "indeed , fig.[fig : fig3 ] ( a ) shows that the induced electron density has two main contributions concentrated around the impurity and across the surface .",
    "a basic hypothesis for the model is that the total charge @xmath43 is independent of the nanocrystal size .",
    "this is supported by the fact that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the induced density near the impurity rapidly converges to the bulk value .",
    "as is shown below , the use of the bulk value for @xmath43 is a good approximation for nanocrystals .",

    "screening in covalent semiconductor nanocrystals has been studied using both advanced _ ab initio _ methods and a thomas - fermi model .",
    "our dft calculations have shown that isocoric donor dopants essentially behave as a point - charge giving an induced charge that agrees well with the linear - response approximation . comparing the induced integrated densities with those obtained in ref . , we have been able to conceptually isolate the features directly related to local field effects .",
    "it is , at least in principle , not easy to distinguish the several contributions to the screening due to local fields .",
    "however , in the specific cases we have analyzed , there is an indication of the fact that surface polarization is the dominant local field effect in semiconductor nanocrystals .",
    "this was proved combining the thomas - fermi theory including electrostatics of surface polarization with the result that the screening function agrees very well with state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that local field effects related to surface polarizations may have dramatic consequences also in the optical response , particularly for anisotropic structure such as wires and ellipsoidal dots .",
    "indeed , it has been shown for both silicon @xcite and germanium @xcite wires that the optical frequency - dependent absorption function is strongly suppressed for light polarized perpendicularly to the wire axis .",
    "this suppression does not come out when local fields are neglected . from a classical point of view , these local fields are again dominated by surface polarization , as originally recognized in interpreting the polarization anisotropy of porous silicon.@xcite although the present model can not be generalized to the case of the response to an external field , it is of interest to note that in both cases , that is , point - charge screening and external field , surface polarization plays a fundamental role at the nanoscale .",
    "the first - principles calculations presented in this work have shown that the concept of bulklike response to an external perturbation introduced in ref . is valid also in a screening problem .",
    "although the induced electron density contains some oscillations , we have shown that it is possible to define a screening radius that is practically independent of the nanocrystal dimension .",
    "the progressive reduction of the screening action is due to the surface polarization . in this paper",
    "we have shown how this contribution may be described with simple electrostatics .",
    "the important point is that now we have an analytical expression for the effective screening function whose validity for both the nanoscale and bulk has been proved .    a final note should be devoted to a possible generalization of the model to the case of off - center impurities .",
    "this could be done , at least in principle , by considering the matching of the thomas - fermi solution to the full image potential of an off - center point - charge .",
    "however , beyond the technical difficulties in doing that , one should consider that the method fails , particularly for very small nanocrystals , when the impurity is at a distance from the nanocrystal surface that is less than or comparable to the screening radius .",
    "we are grateful to professor serdar t for a critical reading of the manuscript . financial support by cofin - prin 2005 is acknowledged .",
    "calculations have been performed at cineca-``progetti supercalcolo 2006 '' and `` campus computational grid''-universit di napoli `` federico ii '' advanced computing facilities ."
