    "long radiative lifetimes of rydberg atoms and their possibility to interact strongly at large distances have made ultracold rydberg atoms interesting systems for possible quantum information applications .",
    "the electron in a rydberg state is very far from the nucleus and thus sensitive to external fields or the presence of neighboring rydberg atoms . due to the huge polarizabilities of rydberg atoms , it is possible to induce relatively large electric dipole moments using small electric fields .",
    "the capability to turn on and off the interactions just by switching the external field is an important aspect of this approach to quantum computation . in this way",
    "decoherence effects due to the interactions between atoms or with the environment , can be significantly reduced .",
    "strong interactions can be used to entangle neutral atoms and achieve fast quantum gates @xcite , as well as to blockade excitation by shifting many - atom excited states out of resonance .",
    "it has been proposed to use this blockading effect to realize scalable quantum gates @xcite .",
    "the evidence of excitation blockade has been found in several experiments with a narrow laser bandwidth . in @xcite , a local blockade of rydberg state excitation in a mesoscopic sample due to",
    "strong van der waals ( vdw ) interactions has been observed using a pulse - amplified single - mode laser .",
    "the @xmath0 ground - state rubidium atoms were excited by one photon uv transitions to high @xmath1 rydberg states .",
    "rydberg excitation exhibited dramatic suppression compared to the non - interacting case .",
    "a mean - field type model was proposed to explain these experimental results . in the model ,",
    "different atoms interact differently depending on their locations .",
    "different interaction energies were modeled by a distribution of mean - field shifts for which a distribution of excitation probabilities was calculated . a good agreement between",
    "the theoretical model and experimental measurements was found.significant suppression of rydberg excitation has also been observed using cw excitation @xcite .",
    "this rydberg excitation , strongly influenced by interactions , exhibits sub - poissonian atom counting statistics @xcite .",
    "the blockade effect due to dipole - dipole interactions in an ultracold sample of cs atoms @xcite has been reported . also , an interesting antiblockade effect in two - step excitation processes was predicted @xcite .    at high principal quantum number @xmath2 ,",
    "the interactions between rydberg atoms are quite strong and they inhibit the excitation of many surrounding atoms within a range of few @xmath3 .",
    "the atoms within this range are strongly correlated so that a many - body treatment is , in general , needed . in @xcite the many - body wave function was calculated by numerically solving the schr \" odinger equation .",
    "this type of analysis can be important for quantum information applications @xcite because precise control at the quantum level is essential in these applications .",
    "strong interactions can affect the coherent manipulation of a large group of atoms so it is necessary to use a many - body treatment to evaluate the fidelity of quantum information protocols .",
    "in this paper we consider mesoscopic samples of @xmath410 @xmath3 diameter containing up to 100 ground - state atoms which are excited by single photon transitions to high @xmath5 rydberg states .",
    "we study in detail the dynamics of such systems , especially the possibility of many - body rabi oscillations of rydberg excitation .",
    "it is plausible to investigate these oscillations in smaller systems because one would not normally expect to achieve the coherent manipulation of large groups of atoms .",
    "the many - body approach developed in @xcite is quite suitable for this analysis and we use it here .",
    "we only modify some technical details on how to treat interactions in this approach .",
    "although models may be very useful in explaining some important overall properties of large strongly - interacting rydberg systems , it is essential to include many - body correlations in the study of many - body effects . in ultracold rydberg systems , the thermal motion of the atoms is greatly reduced so that in many situations it can be completely ignored .",
    "the idea of these collective oscillations can be explained as follows .",
    "if the interactions between atoms are strong enough , all many - body states with two or more excited atoms will be greatly shifted by these interactions and thus far - off resonance .",
    "such systems are effectively two - level systems because there are only two ( collective ) states that are populated : the ground state @xmath6 , where all atoms are in the atomic ground state @xmath7 , and only one excited state @xmath8 where any , but only one , atom can be excited . on atomic resonance",
    "such two - level systems are exactly solvable @xcite and the solution , in terms of excitation probability @xmath9 , is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pulse area and @xmath12 is the number of atoms in the sample .",
    "clearly , the collective oscillations are much faster then the isolated - atom rabi frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the question is whether these fast oscillations can exist in systems which are big enough that there can be several excited atoms , or alternatively with the interactions not strong enough to fully blockade the system .    because the atoms are ultracold",
    ", we ignore the effects of thermal motion during rydberg excitation in this analysis .",
    "we consider the following many - body hamiltonian of two - level atoms and rydberg - rydberg interactions ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the frequency detuning and the interactions between rydberg atoms are given by @xmath17 .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian is the dipole operator representing the interaction with the optical field .",
    "the function @xmath18 is the time evolution ( envelope ) of the laser pulse .",
    "the non - trivial parts of the @xmath19-operators are defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 reffer either to the ground state @xmath22 or the excited state @xmath23 .",
    "we can always eliminate the detuning from the previous hamiltonian by the unitary transformation @xmath24 . in the remaining part of the hamiltonian , the only effect of this transformation is to replace @xmath18 by @xmath25 .",
    "this transformation can simplify the use of other approximations applied to solve ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we assume that it is always performed and there is no need to consider this term explicitly .",
    "in fact , we set @xmath26 in our simulation .    since the dimensionality of the problem is @xmath27 , which is a huge number for numerical calculations with @xmath28 , it is necessary to make some approximations .",
    "the idea of local blockade is utilized here ( more explanations can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we can group atoms in such a way that the probability to have two or more excited atoms within a group is practically zero .",
    "such groups of atoms are often called superatoms .",
    "each superatom  i \" is a two - level system described by two collective states @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the next step ,",
    "the actual many - body hamiltonian is represented / approximated in terms of these superatoms .",
    "for convenience we define new operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in terms of the new operators , the interaction with the laser field",
    "can be expressed as follows @xmath33 because @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of superatoms and @xmath36 is the number of atoms in a superatom .",
    "the rydberg interaction @xmath37 between superatoms  i \" and  j \" in their excited states is @xmath38 in these sums , atoms",
    " p \" and  q \" belong to different superatoms .",
    "the last formula gives the prescription for how to introduce the interaction between superatoms .",
    "it seems that the interaction between two superatoms in @xcite was modeled using the distance between their centers of mass .",
    "equation ( [ sdinteract ] ) suggests that the superatom interaction is rather defined by @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 .",
    "using @xmath40 tends to underestimate the influence of interactions .",
    "the difference between these two ways can be significant if @xmath41 depends strongly on @xmath42 , which is the case here . however , the effect of such differences in interaction energies on the results of simulations is hard to judge because the largest @xmath43 do not contribute to the interactions between superatoms ( explained later in the text ) and because of the strong suppression of rydberg excitation .",
    "this @xmath44 , as the relevant parameter to describe the interactions between superatoms , should be preferably used in the process of the superatom formation as well .",
    "these are the only modifications we make to the method @xcite .",
    "another useful simplification comes from the suppression of rydberg excitation .",
    "namely , the number of excited atoms is limited due to the blockade effect and there is no need to consider many - body states with high numbers of excited atoms . to illustrate the size of the problem after these steps",
    ", we note that for systems with twenty - three superatoms and at most seven of them excited , there are about four hundred thousand excitation amplitudes to solve .",
    "= 2.9 in    to form superatoms we use the same recursion described in @xcite , except that the largest @xmath44 is our guidance in deciding which ( super)atoms to group together .",
    "we use the following recursion .",
    "we initially set the number of superatoms to be equal to the number of atoms .",
    "after that , we start the recursion . in the first step , we calculate the interactions between superatoms using eq .",
    "( [ sdinteract ] ) . in the second step ,",
    "we check if the number of superatoms is equal to the desired number ( chosen in advance ) of superatoms .",
    "if it is , the recursion is over , otherwise , we execute the third step . in this step ,",
    "we group superatoms corresponding to the largest @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the number of superatoms is reduced by one and thus we need to recalculate all @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the recursion cycle is initiated again .",
    "we consider mesoscopic samples of @xmath410 @xmath3 diameter containing up to 100 ground - state atoms .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath0 ground state rubidium atoms are excited by one - photon transitions to @xmath46 rydberg states .",
    "the positions of atoms within a sample are randomly generated before the time evolution of the system takes place .",
    "we typically consider samples of 70 atoms and density of @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "the only exception is the analysis of density fluctuations , shown in fig [ fig_co5 ] , where the number of atoms varies according to a poissonian distribution .",
    "the effect of changing the density is similar to changing the interaction strength , and so we can vary only one of them .",
    "we vary the scaled interaction strength which is obtained as follows . from the schrdinger equation @xmath49 , after the scaling @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we conclude that the final excitation probability @xmath53 is a function of the pulse area and the product @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 . here @xmath56 is the pulse duration ( for a gaussian it is the fwhm ) and @xmath57 is the bandwidth . in our simulations ,",
    "the range of possible pulse areas ( @xmath58 ) is the same for all types of laser pulses .",
    "because the single - atom rabi frequency @xmath13 is scaled by @xmath59 , in the regime where the correlations between atoms are significant , the many - body characteristics of rydberg excitation should be present at relatively small @xmath13 .",
    "the effect of interactions can be amplified , not only by increasing @xmath44 , but also @xmath56 .",
    "increasing @xmath56 also means reducing the bandwidth ( for ideal pulses ) .",
    "when , for some @xmath56 , the interactions between nearest neighbors become comparable with the bandwidth , the influence of interactions on the excitation dynamics should become noticeable .",
    "in our simulations the interactions between atoms are given by @xmath60 .",
    "this type of interactions is also supported by the experiment @xcite , in which the production of ions in collision processes is consistent with the assumption of an attractive van der waals potential and a theoretical estimate of its magnitude . in the model presented in @xcite",
    ", we calculated the effective vdw coefficient @xmath61 to be @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the dispersion coefficient of the strongest @xmath64 potential @xcite .",
    "this @xmath61 is essentially model - dependent , however , using this value we had a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite and thus we use it in this calculation as well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_co1 ] , the time and omega dependencies of the excitation probability are shown for square laser pulses in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "these two dependencies are presented as functions of the pulse area . in both graphs",
    "the dashed curves correspond to particular random distributions of atoms within the sample .",
    "the solid curves are the average over the results obtained from one hundred random arrangement of atoms .",
    "if we use fifty different placements instead of one hundred , the difference in the average excitation probability is only about 1 @xmath65 .",
    "the evaluation of the omega dependence is much more demanding because for each value of @xmath13 we have to calculate the corresponding time dependence first .",
    "although excitation probabilities for particular random distributions of atoms clearly exhibit many - body oscillations , when averaged over many distributions , these oscillations are significantly suppressed .",
    "collective oscillations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_co5 ] are more pronounced because a much greater scaled interaction strength is used .",
    "= 2.9 in    in fig .",
    "[ fig_co2 ] the average time and omega dependencies of the excitation probability for square and gaussian pulses are presented . here",
    "we show how different pulse shapes affect rydberg excitation .",
    "it is known that for resonant single - atom excitation , the excitation probabilities depend only on the pulse area . however , from @xmath66 , we see that varying the pulse area by changing @xmath56 or @xmath13 leads , in general , to different results . only in the limit of a full blockade , according to eq .",
    "( [ full_block ] ) , does @xmath53 again become a function of the pulse area only .",
    "the average time dependencies , for both types of pulses , slowly decrease after reaching saturation ( the first maximum ) .",
    "this slow decrease can be explained by the reduction of the bandwidth @xmath57 for longer pulse durations , i.e. the blockading due to interactions becomes more effective .",
    "the slow increase with omega , after reaching saturation , is expected to happen due to higher laser power .",
    "this figure shows that the excitation probabilities for gaussian pulses are systematically lower than those for square pulses .",
    "this is also expected because of the following somewhat oversimplified argument .",
    "from the point of view of mean - field theory , the effect of interactions is a level shift , which can be expressed as some effective detuning of the excited level . ignoring the time dependence of such level shifts , and in the first approximation ,",
    "the probabilities are given by the fourier transform of the pulse envelope .",
    "however , the fourier transform of a gaussian is also a gaussian so that the fourier components of a gaussian vanish much faster for large detunings than the corresponding fourier components of a square pulse ( which fall off as @xmath67 ) .    in the previous figures we have assumed the interactions between @xmath46 rydberg atoms and , for square pulses , pulse durations of 10 ns at most .",
    "however , the product @xmath68 can still be significantly increased , either by going to higher principal quantum numbers @xmath2 ( increasing @xmath44 due to the @xmath69 scaling of @xmath63 ) or using longer pulses . in practice both ways should probably be used because for high @xmath2 the diatomic energy levels become very close to each other and the interactions at short internuclear distances have complicated forms due to avoided crossings between potential curves . however",
    ", increasing @xmath56 also means decreasing @xmath57 so that the excitation of atoms at shorter internuclear separations can be ignored and thus the van der waals form of interaction can still be appropriate .",
    "actually , the approximations in the superatom approach are justifiable if such excitation can be ignored .",
    "in fact , the largest @xmath70 have no influence on superatom interactions @xmath44 because for such @xmath43 , ideally , both atoms @xmath71 and @xmath72 should belong to the same superatom . the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_co5 ] is obtained for the product @xmath68 15 times larger than the value used in figs .",
    "[ fig_co1]-[fig_co2 ] .",
    "this would roughly correspond to the interactions between @xmath73 rydberg atoms with the same bandwidth @xmath57 .",
    "both curves are obtained after averaging over many random spatial distributions of atoms .",
    "the oscillations are obviously more pronounced here than in fig .",
    "[ fig_co1]-[fig_co2 ] . to see how robust these oscillations are against density fluctuations",
    ", we varied the number of atoms in the sample according to a poissonian statistics .",
    "the dashed curves is obtained after this additional averaging over density fluctuations .",
    "= 2.9 in    in the first approximation , we can find an approximate parametrization of collective oscillations as follows .",
    "from the fact that the initial excitation probabilities do not depend on interactions , and the assumption that as soon as the interactions start to dominate the process they quickly saturate the excitations , one readily derives the following approximate formula @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are respectively the excitation probability and the number of excited atoms at the first maximum of @xmath53 , and @xmath77 is the corresponding pulse area .",
    "the last formula is just the excitation probability for isolated ( noninteracting ) atoms if the pulse area is small .",
    "we can use it because , initially , there are no excited atoms and so there are no effects of interactions . in the next chapter",
    "we give a formal proof ( [ sigma_ee(2 ) ] ) for this claim .",
    "the effects of interactions for small pulse areas @xmath78 are proportional to @xmath79 . depending on the strength of interactions",
    ", this saturation can be achieved much faster than the one in single - atom processes . in terms of frequency ,",
    "the collective phenomena are faster than their counterparts in single - atom processes . assuming that the phase @xmath80 of collective oscillations can be simply characterized by some collective frequency @xmath81 ( i.e. @xmath82 ) , where @xmath83",
    ", the scaling parameter @xmath84 can be obtained from the saturation condition @xmath85 combining the last two equations one gets @xmath86 to illustrate excitations in large samples with a significant excitation blockade , a domain ( or `` bubble '' ) picture is often used .",
    "each domain represents a region in which there exists exactly one rydberg atom .",
    "denoting the number of atoms in a domain by @xmath87 , then @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90    = 2.9 in    the factor @xmath91 can ( and probably should ) be approximated by one ( because for @xmath92 , according to eq .",
    "( [ full_block ] ) , @xmath93 ) .",
    "we conclude that it seems that @xmath94 is the scaling factor of collective oscillations .",
    "we can verify this estimate by comparing with the numerical calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_co2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_co5 ] .",
    "also , if the phase of collective oscillations can be really described by a simple parameter @xmath81 ( or @xmath94 ) , then the ratio of the pulse areas corresponding to the second and the first maximum of @xmath53 should be three .",
    "the figures clearly show that the actual many - body behavior is much more complicated , so we just want to verify how much it deviates from the simple picture . for convenience ,",
    "we define two parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "interestingly , for all square pulse results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig_co2 ] and [ fig_co5 ] , we find @xmath97 , while for the gaussian pulses in fig .",
    "[ fig_co2 ] , @xmath98 .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 varies more . for a square laser pulse in panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_co2 ] , @xmath99 is respectively 0.95 , 0.84 and 1.07 . for the gaussian ones in plots ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_co2 ] , @xmath99 is 0.87 and 0.77 .",
    "besides the many - body rabi oscillations , there are other manifestations of correlations between interacting excited atoms .",
    "one can study the fluctuations of the number of excited atoms . without these correlations , the probability to have a certain number of excited atoms",
    "is determined by the average excitation probability @xmath100 and the total number of atoms @xmath12 .",
    "the probability @xmath101 to get any number @xmath102 of excited atoms is given by the bernoulli formula @xmath103 for a given excitation probability @xmath100 , one can calculate the expected variance @xmath104 assuming no correlations , and then compare it with the actual @xmath105 .",
    "we take the relative size of these variances as the measure of these fluctuations .",
    "this procedure can be done experimentally as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig_co3 ] , we show the ratio @xmath106 as a function of the pulse area . this ratio is smaller than one because there are some restrictions on which combinations of excited atoms can be likely excited in the presence of interactions .",
    "on the other hand , in the absence of correlations , all combinations of excited atoms are equally probable .",
    "this figure also shows that after reaching the minimum , the ratio @xmath106 increases again due to decoherence .",
    "the experimental results @xcite on counting statistics of somewhat larger samples than we consider here do show the sub - poissonian character of rydberg excitation .",
    "= 2.9 in    we have also calculated the spatial correlation function between the central atom and other atoms in mesoscopic samples . for larger samples ,",
    "this function was calculated in @xcite .",
    "they also found some interesting correlations if there is some frequency chirp of the laser pulse . in the presence of chirp , there is a region of internuclear separations @xmath107 for which the correlation function is greater than one . in the absence of chirp",
    "this region does not exist .",
    "we do not include any chirp in our simulations because it is known that it destroys even the single - atom rabi flopping . a delicate point for calculating the correlation function",
    "is that what we really calculate is the correlations beetwen superatoms and these superatoms are quite extended objects .",
    "their linear size is about one third of the sample radius .",
    "averaging over many random arrangements of atoms improves the determination of the correlation functions , but we do not insist on having many points for this function ( fig .",
    "[ fig_co4 ] ) . in the supperatom approach ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath108 between any atom @xmath71 belonging to superatom @xmath109 and any atom @xmath72 belonging to superatom @xmath110 is the same for all @xmath71 and @xmath72 and equal to the correlation function @xmath111 between superatoms @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "in addition , @xmath112 for atoms @xmath71 and @xmath72 belonging to the same superatom .",
    "this suggests that the correlation function @xmath108 implicitly contains , in some sense , spatial averaging over the spatial extension of a superatom . since",
    ", on average , excitation probabilities @xmath113 depend on the atom s location , the correlation function has to be @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the probability to excite simultaneously atoms @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in our case one of atoms",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 is always a central atom . the correlation function averaged over one hundred random positions of atoms is presented in fig . [ fig_co4 ] .",
    "this figure shows that there are almost no correlations ( i.e. @xmath116 ) between the central atom and the atoms near the sample surface .",

    "the possibility of many - body rabi oscillation of rydberg excitation is explored assuming that the @xmath0 ground - state atoms are excited to the @xmath119 rydberg state by laser pulses of @xmath120 ns duration . for typical experimental parameters",
    ", we have found that excitation probability for particular random distributions of atoms clearly exhibit many - body oscillations . however , when averaged over many distributions , these oscillations are significantly suppressed .",
