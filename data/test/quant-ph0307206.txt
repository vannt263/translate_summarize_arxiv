    "entanglement @xcite in a composite system refers to certain implicit correlation between the subsystems arising from their interaction .",
    "it is the key resource of quantum computation and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "due to recent advances in this field , entanglement has generated renewed interest .",
    "there have been different approaches to understand and to quantify entanglement @xcite .",
    "but so far the entanglement , only in a bipartite pure state has been investigated very extensively .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xcite of either of the subsystems provides a good measure of entanglement in this case @xcite .",
    "this is the quantum partner of the shannon s entropy @xcite in classical information theory and is defined as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 . here , @xmath3 is the reduced density operator of the subsystem @xmath4 and is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density operator of the composite system under consideration and @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "in general , the quantities @xmath9 satisfy the following inequality ( due to araki and lieb ) @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the joint entropy of the composite system comprising @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the second part of the above inequality is known as subadditivity inequality @xcite . for a pure state , @xmath14 and thus @xmath15 .",
    "the equality sign in the above relation holds good if and only if the composite density matrix @xmath6 can be written as a tensor product of its two reduced density matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. , for a disentangled state .",
    "one can define the index of correlation @xmath18 given by the expression @xmath19 @xcite , which can also be interpreted as information entropy in quantum information point of view .",
    "we note that kim _",
    "et al . _ have calculated the entropies of different kinds of pure states including two - mode fock states and squeezed states @xcite .",
    "further , the above relation for entropy has been studied in the context of entangled gaussian states @xcite .",
    "so far we have discussed about the measurement of entanglement in a bipartite pure state .",
    "if the composite system is in a mixed state ( defined by the density operator @xmath20 ) , the entanglement of formation @xmath21 can be defined in terms of the average von neumann entropies of the pure states of the decompositions @xcite .",
    "wootters has shown the quantity @xmath21 to be an explicit function of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "he has introduced the notion of concurrence in this context .",
    "we further notice that from the schmidt decomposition of a pure bipartite state , one can properly identify the entanglement present in the state @xcite .",
    "this is also very useful to study bipartite continuous systems @xcite . on the other hand , for a mixed state @xmath20 , the separability criterion has been proposed @xcite to study entanglement .",
    "this is based on positive partial transpose mapping of @xmath20 .",
    "thus the negativity ( entanglement monotone ) of the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of @xmath20 could be a measure of entanglement in a mixed bipartite system @xcite .",
    "the concept of negativity as an entanglement measure has been used in context of interaction of atoms with thermal field @xcite .",
    "the separability criterion has been extended to continuous systems @xcite also .    despite many approaches to define entanglement for a bipartite system ,",
    "there have been only a few approaches to quantify entanglement in the composite systems of three or more particles @xcite .",
    "we note that a generalization of schmidt decomposition in multipartite systems in pure states has been introduced @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a measurement of entanglement in a tripartite system in terms of concurrences of the pairs of subsystems .",
    "this measure is invariant under permutations of the subsystems .",
    "an average entanglement in a four - partite entangled state has been defined in terms of von neumann entropies of the pairs of subsystems @xcite .",
    "very recently , yukalov has addressed the question more generally and quantified multipartite entanglement @xcite in terms of the ratio of norms of an entangling operator and of a disentangling operator in the relevant disentangled hilbert space .    in this paper",
    ", we put forward a possible measurement of entanglement of a four - particle system by studying the entropy of the reduced three - particle system .",
    "as mentioned above , the von neumann entropy is a good measure for entanglement in a bipartite system . for a tripartite composite state ,",
    "this entropy satisfies a strong subadditivity inequality ( ssi ) @xcite , which has many important implications in the subject of quantum information theory . in this paper",
    ", we study the properties of a four - particle entangled state through the three - particle entropy and the ssi .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we provide a brief discussion on strong subadditivity inequality from the quantum information point of view . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe a physical model and show the preparation of a four - particle entangled state . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the validity of the ssi in the present context and provide a physical explanation of the results .",
    "we conclude this paper by proposing a measurement of the corresponding four - particle entanglement .",
    "we have already mentioned that for a bipartite composite system of two particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the joint entropy @xmath11 satisfies the subadditivity inequality ( [ ineq ] ) . for a composite system of three particles a , b , and c , this inequality can be extended to the following form @xcite : @xmath22 this inequality is known as strong subadditivity inequality . the most obvious situation that the equality sign holds in ( [ lieb ] ) is when",
    "the composite density matrix @xmath23 can be written as the tensor product of its three reduced density matrices as @xmath24 , i.e. , when the system is in a disentangled state .",
    "however , the more stringent condition for this reads as @xcite @xmath25    there have been numerous implications of the above inequality ( [ lieb ] ) in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "firstly , it refers to the fact that the conditioning on the subsystem always reduces the entropy , i.e. , @xmath26 , where , @xmath27 is the entropy of a conditional on knowing the state of b. secondly , the above inequality implies that discarding a quantum system never increases mutual information , i.e. , @xmath28 , where , @xmath29 is the mutual information of the subsystems a and b. thirdly , quantum operations never increase mutual information of two subsystems .",
    "this means that if the mutual information of the two subsystems a and b becomes @xmath30 after trace - preserving operation on b , then @xmath31 .",
    "further , this inequality ( [ lieb ] ) implies that the conditional entropy of the subsystems a , b , and c is also subadditive , i.e. , @xmath32 .    to verify ssi",
    ", one needs to calculate the entropies like @xmath33 which clearly requires a three - particle mixed state which we can produce using a pure four - particle entangled state @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how one can prepare a pure four - particle entangled state so that we can study ssi for the first time for a system realizable using cavity qed methods .",
    "we consider two three - level atoms ( a and b ) with relevant energy levels in @xmath0-configuration ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) interacting with a two - mode high quality optical cavity .",
    "the specified annihilation operators for the cavity modes are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the atoms are interacting with the cavity mode @xmath34 in @xmath36 transition and with the mode @xmath35 in @xmath37 transition .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system under rotating wave approximation can be written as    @xmath38\\;,\\ ] ]    where , @xmath39 is the atomic transition frequency between the levels @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 is the respective frequency of the cavity modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath44 @xmath43 provides the atom - cavity coupling .",
    "we assume @xmath44 s to be real and function of time .",
    "we start with the initial state @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the initial numbers of photons in the cavity modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively and the two atoms are in @xmath48 state .",
    "the state of the system can be expanded in terms of the relevant basis states in the following way : @xmath49 from the schrdinger equation we find the following equations of the corresponding probability amplitudes : @xmath50\\;,\\\\ \\dot{d}_6&=&-i(\\sqrt{\\mu + 2}g_{2a}d_4+\\sqrt{\\mu + 2}g_{2b}d_7)\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\dot{d}_7&=&-i(\\sqrt{\\mu + 1}g_{2a}d_5+\\sqrt{\\mu + 2}g_{2b}d_6+\\delta d_7+\\sqrt{n-1}g_{1b}d _ 8)\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\dot{d}_8&=&-i(\\sqrt{n-1}g_{1b}d_7+\\sqrt{\\mu + 1}g_{2a}d_9)\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\dot{d}_9&=&-i(\\sqrt{n}g_{1a}d_1+\\sqrt{n-1}g_{1b}d_5+\\sqrt{\\mu + 1}g_{2a}d_8+\\delta d_9)\\;,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , we have used the following transformations : @xmath51 where , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the one - photon detuning of the cavity modes for the @xmath54-th atom .",
    "here we have assumed that the cavity modes are in two - photon resonance and @xmath55 .    writing these equations ( [ doteq ] ) in the matrix form @xmath56=-i[m][d_i]$ ] , we find that one of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath57 $ ] is zero .",
    "the corresponding eigenstate is @xmath58\\ ; , \\label{dark}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 clearly , this state is an entangled state of four particles , namely , the atoms a and b , and the two modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using appropriate time - dependence of the pulses ,",
    "the four - particle system can be prepared in this state , as discussed in the next section .",
    "recently , there have a few experimental demonstrations of preparation of four - particle entangled state @xcite and performance of a c - not gate @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the state @xmath60 is a two - atom two - mode multipartite coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state which is a counterpart of the well - known cpt state for a single atom interacting with two coherent fields @xcite .",
    "we next discuss how the state @xmath60 can be prepared by using raman adiabatic passage technique .",
    "we assume that both the atoms are initially in @xmath48 state .",
    "we further assume the time - dependence of the rabi frequencies @xmath44 of the two modes as @xmath61 here , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the amplitude of the respective pulse , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the width and time - separation respectively , of the two pulses .",
    "note that the pulses are applied in counterintuitive sequence . under this condition",
    ", the atom - cavity system follows the evolution of the state @xmath60 adiabatically .",
    "this state is a zero eigenvalue eigenstate ( adiabatic state ) of the hamiltonian ( [ hamil1 ] ) . during this process , known as stimulated raman adiabatic technique ( stirap ) @xcite ,",
    "the atom - cavity system remains in this state for all times . in the present case , at the end of the evolution ,",
    "the population of both the atoms are simultaneously transferred to the state @xmath66 . however , if the atoms are not in one - photon resonance , i.e. , if @xmath67",
    ", then this transfer process is not complete .",
    "this happens because the system does not remain confined in the null adiabatic state @xmath60 for @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we now investigate the validity of ssi for any trio of quantum systems in the present process .",
    "we can express this inequality for any three particles , namely , atom a , atom b , and cavity mode @xmath34 with number @xmath46 of photons out of the four - particle system under consideration as @xmath68 here , @xmath69 defines the joint von neumann entropy of the relevant subsystems [ see eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) ] . this can be calculated from the state ( [ wavefunc ] ) by tracing over the other subsystems , e.g. , @xmath70 where , @xmath6 is the reduced density matrix of the atoms a and b and is given by @xmath71 we show the time variation of @xmath72 in fig .",
    "clearly , @xmath73 never becomes negative during the evolution and thus the ssi ( [ ssi ] ) holds for all times .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one clearly sees that for @xmath74 , in long time limit , @xmath72 becomes zero .",
    "this means that the subsystems ( a , b , and the mode @xmath34 with photon number @xmath46 ) become disentangled .",
    "this happens because of complete adiabatic transfer of population to the level @xmath66 of both the atoms at long time limit .",
    "the entire process can be written as @xmath75 we have shown the time - variation of the coefficients @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 [ see eq .  ( [ norm ] ) ] in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this figure reveals the above evolution according to the state @xmath60 under the action of the pulses ( [ pulse ] ) .",
    "but for @xmath80 , since complete population transfer does not occur , the system remains entangled in the state @xmath81 at long time limit .",
    "this is clear from the dashed curve of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , as the equality @xmath82 no longer holds at this time limit .",
    "thus we can recognize the expression @xmath72 [ see eq .",
    "( [ ssi ] ) ] as a measure of four - particle entanglement in the present process .",
    "precisely , @xmath83 , where the equality sign holds good for the disentangled states .",
    "an increase in value of @xmath72 refers to increase in entanglement .",
    "thus , during the evolution , the system gets more entangled for @xmath74 than for @xmath80 .",
    "however , at the end of the evolution , the entanglement persists for nonzero @xmath84 .",
    "we must emphasize here that , the present definition of entanglement measurement satisfies all the relevant criteria , namely , ( a ) it is semipositive , i.e. , @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath82 for an disentangled state , and ( c ) the function @xmath73 is continuous in time domain .",
    "using our four - particle entanglement , we can also study the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) involving the entropies of two particles , say , atoms a and b. they remain strongly correlated during the evolution , as @xmath18 remains much larger than zero . at the end of the evolution , @xmath18 becomes zero for @xmath85 which means that the subsystems become uncorrelated .",
    "in other words , the entanglement between them vanishes .",
    "we note in passing that for a four - particle ghz state defined by @xmath86 of four qubits a , b , c , and d , one is led to a three - particle mixed state @xmath23 defined by @xmath87 in this case , @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath72 in this case becomes zero , as from eq .",
    "( [ ssi ] ) .",
    "so we have a counter - example , in which the equality sign in ( [ lieb ] ) holds for an entangled state , too .",
    "however , we note that the above state ( [ mix ] ) satisfies the condition ( [ must ] ) and thus the said equality .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown for the first time the role of strong subadditivity inequality for entropies in a four - particle composite system .",
    "the stimulated raman adiabatic technique has been used to prepare the four - particle entangled state using two three - level atoms initially in their ground states in a two - mode cavity .",
    "we further show that the parameter @xmath72 could serve as a possible measurement of entanglement in the four - particle entangled state under consideration .              c. h. bennett , g. brassard , s. popescu , b. schumacher , j. a. smolin , and w. k. wootters , phys .",
