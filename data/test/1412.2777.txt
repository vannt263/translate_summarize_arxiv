    "one of the biggest challenges in cosmology and astrophysics nowadays is to understand the nature of the two most abundant components of the universe : dark energy and dark matter .",
    "these are usually described as two independent components where dark matter is responsible for most of the non - relativistic matter in the universe and where dark energy is responsible for the late time acceleration of our universe , which is described by a cosmological constant in the @xmath0-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model .",
    "this standard model is widely used to describe the cosmological evolution of the universe  @xcite , and it fits very well the current observational data . however , this model has some theoretical and observational challenges ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) that open the way for alternative models of dark energy .",
    "recently the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) experiment of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) collaboration presented new evidence against the @xmath0cdm model  @xcite based on the measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) flux - correlation function of the lyman alpha ( ly-@xmath1 ) forest from @xmath6 quasars at high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "comparatively to previous experiments , they provide the line of sight and tangential bao components , and this allows one to determine the angular distance and the hubble distance independently .",
    "their results indicate a deviation from @xmath0cdm of the hubble parameter and of angular distance at an average redshift of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 deviations from  _ _ planck__+wmap and act / spt respectively ) . assuming a @xmath0cdm universe",
    ", this implies a negative energy density for the dark energy component , @xmath11 , which is @xmath12 away from the expected value .",
    "we point out that boss is not optimized to observe quasars at such high redshifts . however , if more data or other experiments show that this discrepancy stands , then it would indicate that @xmath0cdm needs to be revised .",
    "its simplest generalization would consist in allowing for dynamical dark energy ( see  @xcite for a review ) , but this would not be enough to fix this discrepancy . in dynamical dark energy models , all matter contents",
    "are individually conserved , and so , agreeing with the boss result for @xmath13 would require a negative energy density for dark energy  @xcite .",
    "this may lead one to study very exotic forms of dark energy .",
    "a simpler solution is to consider interacting dark energy . indeed",
    ", dark energy could couple to gravity , neutrinos , or dark matter since its effects have only been detected gravitationally .",
    "interaction with baryonic matter ( or radiation ) has very tight constraints from observations @xcite and must be very small or negligible . in this sense , we are interested in models in which dark energy interacts with the dark matter component . in a field theory description of those components , this interaction is allowed and even mandatory  @xcite .",
    "however , the main motivation to introduce such an interaction is to alleviate the coincidence problem , which can be done given an appropriate interaction .    since the nature of the dark sector is unknown , the study of these coupled dark energy models is challenging .",
    "many different models of this interaction have been studied in the literature from the point of view of either interacting field theory or phenomenology ( for a classification of those models , see  @xcite ) . as an example of phenomenological study",
    ", one can consider holographic dark energy or a quintessence field interacting with a dark matter fluid  @xcite .",
    "there are also attempts to develop lagrangian models where one postulates an interaction between the scalar field , playing the role of dark energy , and a fermionic field , playing the role of dark matter  @xcite ( see , however ,  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there have been studies of interacting dark energy models in light of new observations  @xcite . however , we note that there has been only little exploration of the consequences of the results from boss in the literature  @xcite , and these studies do not explore the idea of interacting dark energy and dark matter .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to see what are the phenomenological implications from boss for interacting dark energy .",
    "since this model allows for one of the components to decay into the other , we claim that energy flow from dark energy to dark matter implies a smaller amount of dark matter in the past , thus accommodating for the value of the hubble parameter at @xmath14 found by boss and still maintaining the cosmology today close to @xmath0cdm . as a first test",
    ", we perform a comparison by showing that the observational value of the hubble parameter from quasars given by the boss collaboration , @xmath15 , is consistent with the interacting model with a small positive coupling constant .",
    "this comparison serves to indicate that the interaction is able to accommodate the boss collaboration result .",
    "after that , we perform a full markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis using the new boss data together with the _ planck _ data for the interacting model .",
    "we show that the constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath16 for the interacting model are in better agreement with boss compared to @xmath0cdm .",
    "given the energy conservation of the full energy - momentum tensor , we can suppose that the fluid equations representing dark energy ( @xmath17 ) and dark matter ( @xmath18 ) are not conserved separately . in a friedmann - robertson - walker universe",
    ", we take @xmath19 and all other components follow the standard conservation equations . in the above equations ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the energy densities for dark matter and dark energy , respectively ; @xmath22 is the equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy , considered constant in this work ; and @xmath23 indicates the interaction between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "one can take the taylor expansion of the general interaction term @xmath24 , and thus , it can be represented phenomenologically as @xmath25 , where the coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 are to be determined by observations @xcite .",
    "following our definition , if @xmath28 , then dark energy decays into dark matter , and for @xmath29 , the energy flow is in the opposite direction .",
    "the first case is consistent with the requirement that the energy density for dark energy must be of the same order as the one for dark matter for a longer period of time in order to alleviate the coincidence problem .",
    "the validity of the phenomenological interacting dark energy model was studied in  @xcite where it was found that the curvature perturbation can always be stable when the interaction is proportional to the energy density of dark energy , i.e.  where @xmath30 while @xmath31 .",
    "this is true for the constant equation of state within the range @xmath32 ( we call this model i ) and for @xmath33 ( model ii ) . for the interaction proportional to the dark matter energy density ( @xmath34 while @xmath35 ) , the curvature perturbation is only stable when the constant @xmath36 is smaller than @xmath37 , which we call model iii .",
    "the models are summarized in table  [ table : models ] .",
    "ccc model & @xmath23 & @xmath17 eos + i & @xmath38 & @xmath39 + ii & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + iii & @xmath42 & @xmath41 +    [ table : models ]    in this framework , the friedmann equations can be written as @xmath43\\ , , \\\\",

    "we will use this to construct the hubble parameter for each of the interacting models and compare it with the hubble parameter inferred from the boss quasar data in the next subsection .    for models",
    "i and ii , the energy densities for dark energy and dark matter behave as  @xcite @xmath45\\rho_{de}^0}{\\xi_{2}+\\omega_{de}}+\\rho_{dm}^0\\right\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript 0 indicates quantities measured today .",
    "the baryonic density is given by the standard expression , proportional to @xmath46 . for model iii ,",
    "the evolution of the energy densities is given by  @xcite @xmath47    one can see from these equations that if there is an energy flow from dark energy to dark matter ( i.e. , if the coupling constant is positive ) , then the energy density for dark matter is always smaller than what one would expect in the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "since @xmath20 is the dominant contribution in the friedmann equations at higher redshifts and since observations indicate that the universe is well explained by the @xmath0cdm model at low redshifts , which means that @xmath48 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , one can see from eq .   that the interaction implies a smaller hubble parameter in the past in comparison with @xmath0cdm , when @xmath49 is held fixed and for a positive coupling constant .",
    "furthermore , this helps alleviating the coincidence problem which is the fact that we do not understand why the energy densities of dark energy and dark matter are so close today .",
    "as it can be seen in @xcite , a positive coupling constant implies that the quantity @xmath50 decreases at a slower rate in the interacting model than in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this makes the energy density of dark energy closer to the one of dark matter in the past , giving us a better understanding of their closer values today .      in order to gain some intuition before performing the proper statistical analysis ,",
    "let us see whether the measured value of the hubble parameter by the boss collaboration , @xmath15 , can be accommodated by the phenomenological interacting models introduced above .",
    "from this perspective , we compare the hubble parameter constructed theoretically with its observational value at @xmath51 .        in order to compute the value of the hubble parameter from eqs .",
    ",  , and  , one needs several cosmological parameters such as @xmath49 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the standard @xmath0cdm parameters found from the _ planck _ analysis were used by the boss collaboration ( listed in table  [ table : boss_parameters ] ) .",
    "we first use these parameters to construct @xmath55 , and we show the resulting hubble parameter at @xmath14 with respect to the coupling constant @xmath56 in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : theoretical ] .",
    "alternatively , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : theoretical ] , we use the adjusted cosmological parameters found in  @xcite from the analysis of the interacting model using  _ planck _ , bao , snia , and @xmath57 data .",
    "the goal of using different sets of cosmological parameters is to see if the parameters adjusted to the interacting models yield a different prediction than the parameters adjusted to @xmath0cdm .",

    "[ fig : theoretical ] , the curves are in accordance with the hubble parameter inferred by boss ( indicated by the dashed gray line and by the @xmath71 and @xmath72 shaded areas ) given a nonzero coupling constant .",
    "comparing the left and right panels for model i ( red curve ) , we notice that different cosmological parameters require a different sign for the coupling constant @xmath56 in order to match the boss result .",
    "this indicates that model i may not be fully robust at explaining the observed value of @xmath13 from boss . for models",
    "ii and iii ( the purple and blue curves , respectively ) , we see that the theory can easily be within the @xmath71 shaded area for a positive coupling constant in both panels .",
    "we notice that in order for the theoretical value of @xmath4 to match the boss measurement , the values of the coupling constant have to be higher in the right panel where the cosmological parameters were adjusted to _ _",
    "planck__+bao+snia+@xmath49 data using the interacting model .    at this point ,",
    "[ fig : theoretical ] provides us with indications that a positive coupling constant allows one to explain in a very simple way a smaller value of the hubble parameter in the past , which is not possible with @xmath0cdm or dynamical dark energy , and without requiring a very exotic dark energy component . the fact that we obtain a positive coupling constant is crucial , because only positive values help alleviating the coincidence problem .",
    "thus , this model gives a natural explanation for the energy densities of the dark components at low redshifts and also at high redshifts since they may explain the boss data .",
    "this gives us evidence that the interacting dark energy model has the required features to be able to explain the different cosmological evolution shown by the boss collaboration at higher redshifts .",
    "however , this difference from @xmath0cdm dynamics is also encoded in the angular distances , as inferred by the bao measurement .",
    "we now compare the results for these parameters by performing a global fit analysis of the interacting model with the currently available data .",
    "now that we see some evidence that the interacting dark energy model can explain the deviation from @xmath0cdm observed by boss , we perform a bayesian statistical analysis of the interacting dark energy model with the _ planck _ and boss ly@xmath1 quasar data .",
    "we wish to compare the interacting dark energy model presented here against @xmath0cdm and test the predictions of the interacting dark energy model with the addition of the new boss data . in order to achieve this ,",
    "we perform a global fit by running the cosmomc package @xcite , a publicly available code that performs a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) parameter sampling . to include the interaction between dark energy and dark matter",

    "[ contours ] since it does not carry any additional information ) .",
    "having confirmed that our analysis is consistent , we perform the analysis using only _ planck _ data for the @xmath0cdm and interacting dark energy models .",

    "we can see that for @xmath0cdm ( dotted green lines ) we obtain more or less the same result as @xcite with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this confirms that @xmath0cdm differs from the boss result by at least @xmath90 .",
    "when we test the interacting models ( dotted purple and gray lines ) , this difference is reduced , and we can see that the contours overlap with the @xmath71 region of the boss autocorrelation data .",
    "model ii , for which we find @xmath91 and @xmath92 , shows the biggest overlap with the boss results .",
    "the very elongated contours of model iii imply that this conclusion is less strong in this case .",
    "we then include the boss quasar ly@xmath1 data together with the _ planck _ data and repeat the above analysis .",
    "as a result , the @xmath0cdm contours ( shaded green areas ) are almost unchanged .",
    "our interpretation is that @xmath0cdm is not sensible to the inclusion of this data set ( boss quasar ly@xmath1 data ) , and therefore , it can not accommodate the change in the hubble parameter at high redshift . on the other hand , the interacting models ii and iii ( purple and gray shaded areas )",
    "significantly change with the inclusion of the boss data set .",
    "first , we note that the contours become more constrained , especially in the case of model iii .",
    "also , both models are slightly shifted towards higher @xmath93 and smaller @xmath94 .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath95 and @xmath96 for model ii and @xmath97 and @xmath98 for model iii .",
    "this improves the overlap between the @xmath71 regions of the boss autocorrelation and the interacting models .",
    "model ii shows the best concordance of all .    in performing the mcmc analysis of the interacting models",

    "it is in this context that we compare our results with boss . however , since we find that the fitted values for @xmath103 are approximately equal to what one expects in @xmath0cdm ( given the use of the _ planck _ data ) , we can still compare the hubble parameter values for the interacting models with the boss result .",
    "] , hence resulting in a much reduced tension compared to @xmath0cdm .",
    "this indicates that the interacting model ii is a good candidate to explain the observed deviation from @xmath0cdm from high-@xmath104 bao probes .",
    "the upper bound on the coupling constant for model iii is much smaller than expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : theoretical ] .",

    "[ contours ] , although to a smaller extent than model ii .",
    "the upper bounds found for the coupling constants are compatible with small positive values .",
    "although we can not exclude the possibility that the coupling constants are zero with the data set used , we can see from the constraints obtained for the eos of dark energy that our models are not consistent with @xmath0cdm .",

    "in this paper , we explored the consequences of interacting dark energy in light of the recent results by the boss experiment .",
    "the boss data indicates that the hubble parameter at @xmath14 is smaller than what one would expect from the standard @xmath0cdm model , something that can not be explained by simple dynamical dark energy models such as quintessence .",
    "our results suggest that interacting dark energy can naturally explain the boss data without introducing exotic forms of dark energy .",
    "we tested three different phenomenological models of interacting dark energy .",
    "first , we computed the theoretical value of the hubble parameter at @xmath14 for different sets of cosmological parameters .",
    "models ii and iii showed to be in good agreement with the observations for a small positive coupling constant .",
    "furthermore , such a positive coupling constant can help alleviating the coincidence problem .",
    "model i was omitted from the analysis since it did not contribute to reducing the tension with the boss data , and also , in general , it does not help relieving the coincidence problem .",
    "we then performed a global fit of those models given the _",
    "planck _ 2013 and boss quasar ly@xmath1 data .",
    "this showed that models ii and iii are compatible with the boss collaboration results at a good confidence level , reducing the discrepancy coming from @xmath0cdm .",
    "model ii appeared as the most promising theory , presenting a small positive coupling constant .",
    "also , we could see from the eos obtained that those models are different than @xmath0cdm at high confidence level ( _ _ planck__+boss ) .",
    "these results suggest that the interacting dark energy models presented in this paper can be used to explain the deviations from @xmath0cdm found in high-@xmath104 bao , and they represent a simpler solution than invoking exotic dark energy models .    in order to further constrain interacting dark energy models , one could refine the analysis of this work by using more data sets and by combining the boss data with other observations .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the global fit of those models with the inclusion of boss data is the topic of a follow - up paper that is currently in preparation .",
    "furthermore , the jpas telescope  @xcite will be able to reproduce and improve the bao measurements at high redshifts since this instrument is supposed to be optimized to measure quasars at high redshifts compared to previous experiments  @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper , we show that an interaction between dark matter and dark energy is in better agreement with the most recent large scale structure observations than the standard @xmath0cdm scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the result presented by the boss - sdss collaboration measuring the baryon acoustic oscillations of the ly-@xmath1 forest from high - redshift quasars indicates a @xmath2 departure from the standard @xmath0cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that the evolution of dark energy at high redshifts has been measured , and the current results can not be explained by simple generalizations of the cosmological constant . we show here that a simple phenomenological interaction in the dark sector provides a good explanation for this deviation , naturally accommodating the hubble parameter obtained by boss , @xmath3 . by performing a global fit of the parameters with the inclusion of this new data set together with the _ planck _ data for the interacting model , we are able to show that some interacting models have constraints for @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are compatible with the ones obtained by the boss collaboration , showing a better concordance than @xmath0cdm . </S>",
    "<S> a small positive coupling constant is obtained for those models , which also helps alleviating the coincidence problem . </S>"
