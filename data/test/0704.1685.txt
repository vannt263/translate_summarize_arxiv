    "the phase transition in the early universe could produce different kinds of topological defects which have some important implications in cosmology@xcite .",
    "domain walls are two - dimensional defects , and strings are one - dimensional defects .",
    "point - like defects also arise in same theories which undergo the spontaneous symmetry breaking , and they appears as monopoles . the global monopole , which has divergent mass in flat spacetime , is one of the most interesting defects .",
    "the idea that monopoles ought to exist has been proved to be remarkably durable .",
    "barriola and vilenkin @xcite firstly researched the characteristic of global monopole in curved spacetime , or equivalently , its gravitational effects .",
    "when one considers the gravity , the linearly divergent mass of global monopole has an effect analogous to that of a deficit solid angle plus that of a tiny mass at the origin .",
    "harari and loust @xcite , and shi and li @xcite have shown that this small gravitational potential is actually repulsive .",
    "furthermore , li _ et al _",
    "@xcite have proposed a new class of cold stars which are called d - stars ( defect stars ) .",
    "one of the most important features of such stars , comparing to q - stars , is that the theory has monopole solutions when the matter field is absent , which makes the d - stars behave very differently from the q - stars .",
    "the topological defects are also investigated in the friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the properties of global monopoles in asymptotically ds / ads spacetime @xcite and the brans - dicke theory @xcite are very different from those of ordinary ones .",
    "the similar issue for the gravitational mass of composite monopole , i.e. , global and local monopole has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "the huge attractive force between global monopole @xmath0 and antimonopole @xmath1 proposes that the monopole over - production problem does not exist , because the pair annihilation is very efficient .",
    "barriola and vilenkin have shown that the radiative lifetime of the pair is very short as they lose energy by goldstone boson radiation @xcite .",
    "no serious attempt has made to develop an analytical model of the cosmological evolution of a global monopole , so we are limited to the numerical simulations of evolution by bennett and rhie @xcite . in the @xmath2-model approximation ,",
    "the average number of monopoles per horizon is @xmath3 .",
    "the gravitational field of global monopoles can lead to clustering in matter , and later evolve into galaxies and clusters .",
    "the scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations has been given @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can numerically obtain the microwave background anisotropy @xmath4 patterns @xcite .",
    "comparing theoretical value to the observed rms fluctuation , one can find the constraint of parameters in global monopole .",
    "on the other hand , non - canonical kinetic terms are rather ordinary for effective field theories .",
    "the k - field theory , in which the non - canonical kinetic terms are introduced in the lagrangian , have been recently investigated to serve as the inflaton in the inflation scenario , which is so - called k - inflation @xcite , and to explain the current acceleration of the universe and the cosmic coincidence problem , k - essence @xcite .",
    "armendariz - picon _ et al _ @xcite have discussed gravitationally bound static and spherically symmetric configurations of k - essence fields .",
    "another interesting application of k - fields is topological defects , dubbed by k - defects @xcite .",
    "monopole @xcite and vortex @xcite of tachyon field , which as an example of k - field comes from string / m theory , have also been investigated .",
    "the mass of global k - monopole diverges in flat spacetime , just as that of standard global monopole , therefore , it is of more physical significance to consider the gravitational effects of global k - monopole .    in this paper , we study the gravitational field of global k - monopole and derive the solutions numerically and asymptotically .",
    "we find that the topological condition of vacuum manifold for the formation of a k - monopole is identical to that of an ordinary monopole , but their physical properties are disparate .",
    "especially , we show that the mass of k - monopole can be positive in some form of the non - canonical kinetic terms . in other words ,",
    "the gravitational field can be attractive or repulsive depending on the non - canonical kinetic term .",

    "the static spherically symmetric metric can be written as @xmath25 with the usual relation between the spherical coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the `` cartesian '' coordinate @xmath29 . introducing a dimensionless parameter @xmath30 , from ( [ s ] ) and ( [ config ] ) , we obtain the equations of motion for @xmath31 as @xmath32f'-\\frac{2}{r^2}f\\right\\}+ \\ddot{k}\\frac{x'f'}{a } - \\lambda^2f(f^2 - 1)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath33 , the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath35 . since we only consider the static solution , positive @xmath34 and negative @xmath34 are irrelevant each other . in this paper",

    "the tt and rr components of the einstein equations now could be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "although the existence of global k - monopole , as well as the standard one , is guaranteed by the symmetry - breaking potential , there exist the non - canonical kinetic term in k - monopole which certainly leads to the appearance of a new scale in the action and the mass parameter in the potential term .",
    "however , the non - canonical kinetic term is non - trivial . at small gradients , it can be chosen to have a same asymptotical behavior with that of the standard one , so that it ensures the standard manner of a small perturbations . while at large gradient we choose it to have a different form from the standard one .    in the small @xmath34 case ,",
    "we assume that the kinetic term has the asymptotically canonical behavior , which can avoid `` zero - kinetic problem '' .",
    "if @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 , and @xmath44 then there is a singularity at @xmath45 ; and @xmath46 then the system becomes non - dynamical at @xmath45 .",
    "for the monopole solution , it is easily found that @xmath47 at @xmath48 . on the other hand",
    ", we assume that the modificatory kinetic term @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath51 . one can easily obtain the equation of motion inside the core of a global monopole after assuming that @xmath51 in the core of the global monopole .",
    "the equations of motion are highly non - linear and can not be solved analytically .",
    "next , we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of global monopole with non - linear in @xmath34 kinetic term .",
    "to be specific , we consider the following type of kinetic term @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a parameter of global k - monopole .",
    "it is easy to find that global k - monopole will reduce to be the standard one when @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to check whether the kinetic term ( [ kx ] ) satisfy the condition for the hyperbolicity @xcite @xmath55 which leads to a positive definite speed of sound for the small perturbations of the field .",
    "the stability of solutions shows that for the case @xmath56 , the range @xmath57 must be excluded .",
    "however , this will not destroy the results which are carried out from the case @xmath58 .",
    "we here only consider the cases for @xmath58 .    using eqs.([gold])-([t11 ] ) , we get the asymptotic expression for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 which is valid near @xmath62 , @xmath63}{60\\,\\left ( 1 + 5\\beta\\,{{f_0}}^2 \\right)}{r}^3 \\\\\\nonumber & + & \\frac{f_0\\left[\\left ( 9 + 7\\beta\\,\\lambda^2 \\right ) \\,\\epsilon^2 \\,{{f_0}}^2 + 36\\beta^2\\,\\epsilon^2 \\,{{f_0}}^6 \\right ] } { 60\\,\\left ( 1 + 5\\beta\\,{{f_0}}^2 \\right )        } { r}^3+o(r^4)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath64 @xmath65 where the undetermined coefficient @xmath66 is characterized as the mass of k - monopole , which can be determined in the numerical calculation .    in the region of @xmath48",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath31 will approach to zero when @xmath76 and approach to unity when @xmath77 .",
    "actually there is a general solution to einstein equation with energy - momentum tensor @xmath38 which takes the form as ( [ t00 ] ) and ( [ t11 ] ) for spherically symmetric metric ( [ metric ] ) @xmath78r^2dr\\ ] ] @xmath79.\\ ] ] in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath72 , the metric coefficient @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be formally integrated and read as @xmath80 @xmath81 the small dimensionless parameter @xmath72 arise naturally from einstein equations and clearly @xmath82 describes a solid angular deficit of space - time .",
    "a global k - monopole solution @xmath31 should approach unity when @xmath83 . if this convergence is fast enough , then @xmath84 and @xmath85 will also rapidly converge to finite values .",
    "therefore , from eqs.([fb])-([br ] ) we have the asymptotic expansions : @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "one can easily find that the dependence on @xmath72 of the asymptotic expansion for @xmath61 is very weak , in other words , the asymptotic behavior is quite independent of the scale of symmetry breakdown @xmath88 up to value as large as the planck scale . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath84 depends obviously on @xmath88 .     as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "here we choose @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    ", we find that the mass of global k - monopole decrease to a negative asymptotic value when @xmath33 approaches infinity in the case that @xmath54 and @xmath69 . while the mass will be positive if @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "the asymptotic mass for the cases above are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "it is clear that the presence of parameter @xmath53 , which measures the degree of deviation of kinetic term from canonical one , affects the effective mass of the global k - monopole significantly .",
    "it is not difficult to understand this property . from eqs.([kx ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ solution1 ] ) , the mass function @xmath84 can be expressed explicitly as @xmath94r^2dr.\\ ] ] obviously , the @xmath53-term in the integration has the positive contribution for the mass function . from fig.[f ] , @xmath31 ( then @xmath34 ) is not sensitive to the value of @xmath53 , so the greater parameter @xmath53 is chosen , the larger value @xmath84 takes for a given @xmath33 , and if @xmath53 is greater than some value , @xmath84 will be positive for large @xmath33 as fig.[ma ] shows .",
    "however , inside the core , @xmath34 varies slowly but @xmath31 varies fast with respect to @xmath33 , therefore , @xmath95-term in the integration will become dominant as @xmath33 decreases .",
    "this leads to two characteristics of the mass curves which is also shown in fig.[ma ] : ( i ) the mass curves with different @xmath53 converge gradually in the region near @xmath62 ; ( ii ) in the case that @xmath53 is large enough , @xmath84 has a minimum .    to show the effect of solid defect angle",
    ", we then investigate the motion test particles around a global k - monopole .",
    "it is a good approximation to take @xmath84 as a constant in the region far away from the core of the global k - monopole , since the the mass @xmath84 approaches very quickly to its asymptotic value .",
    "therefore , we can consider the geodesic equation in the metric ( [ metric ] ) with @xmath96 where @xmath97 . solving the geodesic equation and introducing a dimensionless quantaty @xmath98 , one will get the second order differentiating equation of @xmath99 with respect to @xmath28 @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the angular momentum per unit of mass .",

    "when a test particle rotates one loop around the global k - monopole , the precession of it will be @xmath105 the last term in eq.([d ] ) is the modificaiton comparing this result with that for the precession around an ordinary star .",
    "in summary , k - monopole could arise during the phase transition in the early universe .",
    "we calculate the asymptotic solutions of global k - monopole in static spherically symmetric spacetime , and find that the behavior of a k - monopole is similar to that of a standard one .",
    "although the choice of the parameter @xmath53 , which measures the degree of deviation of kinetic term from canonical one , have little influence on the configuration of k - field @xmath106 , the effective mass of global k - monopole is affected significantly .",
    "the mass might be negative or positive when different parameters @xmath53 are chosen .",
    "this shows that the gravitational field of the global k - monopole could be attractive or repulsive depending on the different non - canonical kinetic term .",
    "the configuration of a global k - monopole is more complicated than that of a standard one . as for its cosmological evolution , we should not attempt to get the analytical mode , instead we can only use numerical simulation . however , the energy dominance of global k - monopole is in the region outside the core .",
    "we can roughly estimate that global k - monopoles will result in the clustering in matter and evolve into galaxies and clusters in a way similar to that of standard monopoles .",
