    "in their comment , @xcite delaney and greer ( dg ) claim that the unphysical result ( current @xmath2 ) presented by us in ref .",
    "( hereafter , i ) as evidence against their variational approach @xcite is due to the fact ( i ) that our constraints ( electronic populations ) prevent a broken time - reversal symmetry , and ( ii ) that we used real orbitals , which concomitantly constrain incoming and outgoing electrons .",
    "further , dg accept that our idea to constrain populations `` is an interesting alternative to the wigner function '' ( wf ) , but ( iii ) argue that to get @xmath3 it is essential to use complex orbitals , like those obtained by applying periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) for electrodes . by using the superscript @xmath4 and by referring to their work,@xcite which we amply criticized @xcite they aim to convey the false impression that they used such complex orbitals previously .",
    "responding briefly , claim ( i ) is incorrect , claim ( ii ) has absolutely no real basis , while claim ( iii ) does not mender their variational approach ; the complex orbitals discussed by them solely represent a particular case of the general case of i and do not in the least change the unphysical linear response current @xmath2 .",
    "dg argue that the unphysical result ( @xmath2 ) deduced in i is the consequence of our unsuitable choice of constraints , namely the particle number operators .",
    "they ( incorrectly ) claim that constraining _",
    "real _ particle number operators does not break time - reversal symmetry , and for this very reason the current vanishes even beyond the linear response limit examined in i.    we shall immediately show that this is not true : our constraints _ allow _ a broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the fact that this symmetry is _ not _ broken is the _ result _ of the defective dg variational ansatz ( constrained energy minimization at zero temperature ) .",
    "below , we shall only discuss the particular constraint @xmath5 mentioned in the comment .",
    "let us consider a general many - body state , @xmath6 , expanded in terms of the complete set of the real eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath7 of the finite transport cluster without external bias ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 .",

    "( [ eq - q - k ] )  ( [ eq - an - ast ] ) .",
    "beyond linear response , eqs .",
    "( [ eq - q - k ] )  ( [ eq - an - ast ] ) are coupled nonlinear equations , and the solution is _ not _ necessarily unique . in i , we do _ solve _ this problem for linear response , show that the solution _ is _ unique , and the unphysical result @xmath2 is the _ outcome _ of these calculations . throughout our critical analysis of the dg approach , @xcite to be on the safe side ,",
    "we confined ourselves to the linear response limit , wherein the solution is _ unique _ and its lamentable failure can be unambiguously stated . it _ is _ possible that the dg current vanishes beyond the linear response limit,@xcite but we can not _ safely _ state this . but _ if _ this were the case , it would have nothing to do with the dg claim : as seen above , constraining populations does not prevent a broken time - reversal symmetry . whether the solution of the nonlinear problem corresponds to @xmath2 or not did and does not represent our concern once the linear response limit is incorrect .",
    "this would be yet another unphysical dg prediction , as we already stated _ explicitly _ : see the last but one paragraph of sec .",
    "vi in ref .  .",
    "let us now see what is wrong with the dg argumentation yielding the `` conclusion '' that constraining populations is unphysical .",
    "there are two reasons why their conclusion is incorrect : on one hand , the dg argumentation eliminates an important aspect and , on the other hand , it introduces an unjustified assumption .",
    "dg seem to have realized that current conservation is a serious stumbling block for their argumentation ; noteworthy , the steps 16 listed in the beginning of the comment omit the current conservation .",
    "they first discuss the minimization _ ignoring _ the current conservation .",
    "this amounts to exclude the last term of the square parentheses of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - min ] ) , ( [ eq - an ] ) , and ( [ eq - an - ast ] ) above .",
    "this _ almost _ suffices to argue that eqs .",
    "( [ eq - q - k ] )  ( [ eq - an - ast ] ) automatically imply real coefficients @xmath10 . ``",
    "almost '' but not _ really _ , because the unknown @xmath10 can be complex ( @xmath33 ) despite the fact that all the other quantities entering these equations are real ( remember @xmath34 ) .",
    "then , to more `` convincingly '' argue that our constraints do not break the time - reversal symmetry , dg supplement their argumentation with an _ unjustified _ supposition .",
    "namely , they simply _ postulate _ that `` the variational approach assumes a unique solution @xmath35  '' the dg variational approach is a well - defined mathematical problem .",
    "needless to say , whether a solution _ exists _ and is furthermore _",
    "unique _ can not be `` assumed '' in any mathematical problem .",
    "this should be _ demonstrated _ , an imperious requirement particularly in the case of such an approach , whose shortcomings are so amply documented .",
    "@xcite in the last part of their argumentation , dg claim that their deduction that @xmath35 is real remains true if they impose current conservation .",
    "as discussed above , this unjustified assertion is contradicted by our eqs .",
    "( [ eq - an ] ) and ( [ eq - an - ast ] ) . as a matter of fact , it is just the opposite sign of the last term in the square parentheses of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - an ] ) and ( [ eq - an - ast ] ) that is related to the broken time - reversal symmetry expressed by the transformation @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 in dg s notation ) noted above .",
    "dg also mention this transformation but fail ( or avoid ) to correctly include the current conservation as a constraint in the energy minimzation that has to be done .    to summarize",
    ", constraining populations is very possible and does not in the least exclude a broken time - reversal symmetry . were our choice to constrain electronic populations inadequate , which are used in the most well - established approaches for the uncorrelated and correlated transport [ like those based on boltzmann s equations , nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf ) , master equations , etc ] , all these approaches would fail , but this is not the case .",
    "they all employ the fermi distributions ( fds ) @xmath39 to express open boundary conditions for incoming electrons .    before ending this section",
    ", we still make the following remark .",
    "most important for the invalidity of the variational dg approach demonstrated in i is that it leads ( even with the constraints most justifiable physically , namely @xmath40 ) to an _ unphysical _ result .",
    "we paid and pay little attention to the fact that the deduced current vanishes . by chance ,",
    "the current could have been nonvanishing , as could fortuitously ( but must not ) happen when using the dg variational ansatz with wigner constraints ( e.  g. , fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "there are certainly _ many _ possibilities to obtain nonvanishing currents by constraining ad hoc complex hermitian operators , since all these generally yield @xmath41 : see eqs .",
    "( 18)(20 ) of i for @xmath42 ; one needs not be too `` careful '' for this , contrary to the impression which dg attempt to convey . essential to deduce results which are physically relevant is to be careful in selecting from the very broad class @xmath43 mentioned in the comment those hermitian operators which are associated to observables able to express the physical reality at the boundaries . and , according to the present community s wisdom , a choice better justifiable physically than the electronic momentum distributions ( fds ) is not known ; dg themselves have to admit that they represent `` an interesting alternative to the '' wf ( cf .",
    "last paragraph of the comment ) .",
    "attempting to give a physical basis to their criticism , dg switch to the single - particle description and claim that we can not constrain only incoming electrons , as appropriate for transport , because our single - particle wave functions ( orbitals ) are real , and outgoing electrons become concomitantly constrained .    in i ( as well as in sec .",
    "[ sec - time - reversal ] ) we need not orbitals at all , nor constrain orbitals , so it is not true what dg write that we `` have decided to constrain the occupation of _ real _ states of the left electrodes of approximate form @xmath44 '' .",
    "these ( approximate ) wave functions pertain to an _ isolated _ electrode ( i.  e. , uncoupled to a device ) with open boundary conditions ( obcs ) . here , _",
    "open _ is meant not in the sense of transport theories ( of a system exchanging particles and energy with environment ) , but in that used , e.  g. , in numerical exact diagonalization or dmrg ( density matrix renormalization group ) studies , of a system with open ends whose wave function vanishes at the boundaries [ in dg s notation , @xmath45 . our boundary conditions ( bcs ) for the isolated electrodes [ cf .",
    "( 6 ) of i ] are _ general _ ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - complex ] ) .    nevertheless , to understand why the dg claim is incorrect",
    "let us suppose in this section that we would have imposed obcs .",
    "the dg s analysis related to the functions @xmath46 explains nothing but the trivial fact that a current can not flow in an isolated electrode .",
    "how could a current flow in an electrode uncoupled to device ?",
    "what we constrained is clearly visible in eq .",
    "( 23 ) of i : that the populations of the incoming electrons in two _ many - body _ states ( @xmath47 for @xmath8 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 ) pertaining to the _ total _ system ( electrodes _ coupled _ to the device ) are equal .",
    "we did not constrain noninteracting electrons confined within an isolated electrode described by the wave function denoted by dg by @xmath50 .",
    "this would be meaningless physically . that our constraints refer to _",
    "incoming _ electrons was already indicated in the step ( ii ) of sec .",
    "ii of i. our erratum,@xcite which dg attempt to misinterpret to gain more credibility , merely emphasizes this fact ; it neither corrects an error nor retracts a statement .",
    "in fact , as already noted above and discussed in detail below , our results apply to more general cases than that analyzed in the comment , but let us still remain in the latter framework .",
    "dg calculations would also be possible by using single - electron wave functions @xmath51 to build all slater determinants needed to exhaus the total electrode - device hilbert space and express the general many - body state @xmath35 required for the prescribed minimization .",
    "( notice that our demonstration of i is exact and does not rely upon any approximate ci expansion , contrary to ref .  ) .",
    "the physical content of the orbitals @xmath52 with @xmath53 [ these are the dg s @xmath54 is that incoming ( @xmath55 ) and outgoing ( @xmath56 ) electrons move symmetrically in the isolated left electrode .",
    "if we formulated in i the dg variational ansatz in terms of orbitals , the transport approach would have _ allowed _ a broken @xmath55(coming)-@xmath56(going)symmetry when the electrodes are coupled to a device [ @xmath57 for a nonvanishing bias @xmath49 .",
    "a current @xmath32 can flow only through a device _ coupled _ to electrodes .",
    "these @xmath51 s would have been used throughout to express all averages needed in i [ including the rhs of eq .",
    "( 23 ) , that is , at @xmath8 for electrodes _ coupled _ to a device ] and _ determined _ self - consistently from the dg variational ansatz , just like our @xmath10 s of i or above in sec .",
    "[ sec - time - reversal ] .",
    "whether this symmetry , _ allowed _ to be broken , _ is _ indeed broken and a current indeed flows ( @xmath3 ) should be determined by performing calculations within the dg variational ansatz , and this is exactly what we did within the many - body formalism of i. _ if _ the dg variational ansatz were valid , the minimization would yield wave functions @xmath58 different from @xmath59 and @xmath41 , in the same way in which it would have led to im@xmath60 in i and in sec .",
    "[ sec - time - reversal ] above .",
    "of course , this cumbersome approach based on the first quantization is equivalent to the second quantization formalism employed in i , and what is important is the unphysical _ outcome _ ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that the dg transport ansatz is invalid .",
    "dg chose the obcs as a stumbling block for the demonstration of i , but , because that case turned out to be more subtle , ended becoming trapped themselves in this pitfall .",
    "by contrast , the case of pbcs indicated by them as a way - out solution is really much easier to analyze and allows to easily understand the correctness of the result @xmath2 of i.    as already noted , our derivation of the unphysical result @xmath2 for the linear response limit in i is very general . to give a flavor on how general are the situations where the dg variational ansatz fails , we referred to a rather broad class of uncorrelated and correlated models , which are mostly used in nanotransport , although our demonstration applies well beyond that class . in i we gave a formal general analytical demonstration and needed not bother to do expensive numerical calculations for certain device models nor become involved by giving a particular type of the bcs for the isolated electrodes or explicitly indicating which labels @xmath61 refer to single - particle states of incoming electrons and which to outgoing electrons , although they can be obviously specified ( see below in this section and sec .",
    "[ sec - el - h ] ) .    by inspecting the second and third lines of eq .  ( 6 ) of i , one can immediately realize that our isolated electrodes can be described by _",
    "general _ boundary conditions . just for not to bother the reader with an unnecessary lengthy discussion of the bcs , we avoided , e.  g. , to specify the site indices at the ends of the electrodes opposite to the device , and wrote @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the second and third lines of eq .",
    "( 6 ) of i. the message of our refs .   is unambiguous and leaves no hope : the dg approach is completely incorrect and can not be rescued .",
    "having demonstrated this , we doubted and doubt on the usefulness or necessity of a too detailed analysis of an approach so incorrect .",
    "the results of i apply for the aforementioned obcs ( sec .",
    "[ sec - real - orbitals ] ) , but also for boundaries that are , e.  g. , periodic ( pbcs ) , anti - periodic ( moebius ) or general twisted ( see , e.  g. , ref .   and citations therein ) . to this , one should keep , e.  g. , @xmath64 sites in the right electrode and impose , e.  g. , that the annihilation operators satisfy @xmath65 , @xmath66 , or @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is a real constant phase ) , respectively .",
    "the left and right electrodes can even be described by different types of boundaries .    in their comment , dg concede that our idea of constraining populations `` is an interesting alternative to the wigner function '' , but claim that it is essential to choose complex single - particle wave functions associated to pbcs . accepting also this dg s challenge now ,",

    "the incorrect claims of dg made us aware of a limitation of the usefulness of the wf for transport , which we could not find in the literature .",
    "the wf ( @xmath190 ) is employed in many physical studies , including transport s , in spite of its physical limitations .",
    "the limitation known from textbooks @xcite traces back to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "the wf can be negative and should be not interpreted as a probability distribution , but rather as `` one step in the calculation  never the last step , since '' is not measurable but `` is used to calculate other quantities that can be measured  the particle density and current '' and ``",
    "no problems are encountered as long as one avoids interpreting @xmath190 as a probability density '' ( quotations from ch .",
    "3.8 , p.  203 of ref .  ) .",
    "as noted above , in transport it is helpful to distinguish between incoming and outgoing electrons . to this aim , it is necessary to use a physical property enabling to indubitably assess that electrons are , say , left- or right - moving .",
    "the averages of the particle current operator @xmath191 used above or the _ physical _ momentum do represent such properties . to see whether the momentum `` variable '' @xmath0 of the wf @xmath192 justifies to speak of left- or right - moving electrons depending on the sign of @xmath0 ,",
    "let us consider @xmath112 noninteracting electrons confined within a one - dimensional square well of width @xmath193 and infinite height .",
    "( this could be the isolated electrode considered by dg . )",
    "electrons occupy energy levels @xmath194 , whose single - electron wave functions @xmath195 $ ] ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 ) are just those that dg @xcite incorrectly claim we would have used in ref .  . in the ground state ,",
    "the lowest @xmath112 levels are occupied up to the fermi `` momentum '' @xmath198 .",

    "[ fig : wf ] .",

    "[ fig : wf ] ) , at larger sizes ( much larger than those one could hope to tackle within ab initio calculations to correlated molecules , for which the dg approach @xcite was conceived ) the curves ( the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] ) become more similar to a step function , and one may think that this is encouraging . in reality , the contrary is true : as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] , _ mathematically _ one can calculate the wf for positive and negative `` momentum '' variables @xmath0 _",
    "separately_. however , this mathematical separation does not reflect a physical reality : for any single - particle eigenstate @xmath61 the electron momentum vanishes , @xmath204 ; left- and right - traveling waves are entangled with equal weight , and one can not speak of single - particle eigenstates representing left- or right - moving electrons only because wigner functions with positive or negative @xmath0-arguments can be computed .",
    "this represents a further limitation of the usefulness of the wf , not related to the heisenberg s principle , which is particularly relevant for transport .",
    "the current has a direction , and if one wants to unambiguously specify this direction , the wf @xmath202 is inappropriate ; a wf with negative ( positive ) `` momentum '' , @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) , does not imply that left- and right - moving particles exist in the real physical world .",
    "so , using @xmath168 and @xmath169 as if they were true momentum distributions of incoming electrons , as dg did,@xcite is not justified in quantum mechanics .",

    "approach,@xcite we can state that this approach lamentably fails because virtually all its ingredients are incorrect :    * the dg approach imposes boundary conditions as if the wf were a true particle distribution , which is not justified quantum mechanically . replacing the wf - constraints by the boundary conditions most justified physically (",

    "the lamentable failure of the dg approach was demonstrated by explicit calculations for the simplest uncorrelated and correlated , discrete and continuous models.@xcite they contradict well - established experimental and theoretical results , and it would make little sense to more amply document the incorrectness in _ many _ other cases.@xcite by contrast , dg could not present even a single example where it is valid .    based on ingredients unfounded physically , it is not at all surprising that the currents predicted by the dg approach are completely unphysical and much poorly agreeing with experiment that more common approaches , contrary to the seemingly original success claimed in ref .  .",

    "<S> we also discuss a general reason why transport approaches which , like the dg s , are solely based on information on an isolated nanocluster are incorrect . </S>"
