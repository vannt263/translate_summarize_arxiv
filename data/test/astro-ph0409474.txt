    "galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models are useful tools to understand how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "in particular , abundance and abundance ratio trends can be read as records of different evolutionary histories and interpreted in terms of the different time scales on which different objects evolve ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . unfortunately , dealing with very complex and poorly known mechanisms such as mass accretion , star formation and stellar feedback , brings with it the need for many assumptions and parameters . as a consequence , gce models are by no means unique ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile quantifying the uncertainties of gce predictions arising from different treatments of the physical processes involved with structure formation and evolution .",
    "here we concentrate on uncertainties due to different assumptions on the stellar imf . by comparing the model predictions with the available data ,",
    "we show that particular imf slopes can be ruled out in the galaxy , whilst a `` standard '' solar neighbourhood imf is not suitable to describe the high metallicities observed in ellipticals .",
    "the most widely used functional form for the imf is an extension of the `` original mass function '' proposed by @xcite to the whole stellar mass range , @xmath0 for 0.1 @xmath1 100 . besides this , multi - slope expressions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and a lognormal form for the low - mass part of the imf ( @xmath2 1 @xmath3 ; @xcite ) are considered here . in the latter case ,",
    "for the 1100 @xmath3 stellar mass range we adopt a power - law form with an exponent @xmath4 = 1.7 .    in fig .  1 we show the fractional masses falling in specific mass ranges according to different imf choices , for one single stellar generation .",
    "an example of what one gets when integrating over the galactic lifetime , i.e. over many stellar generations , is given in fig .  2 , where we display the predicted behaviour of [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] for",
    "all the imfs listed above .",
    "we choose oxygen because of its well understood nucleosynthetic origin ( @xcite ) and because the very high - quality data available for solar neighbourhood stars ( @xcite ) allow for a very meaningful comparison between model predictions and observations .",
    "although theoretical errors of the order of 0.20.3 dex can be associated to model predictions owing to the uncertainties in the actual imf form , it is apparent that both salpeter s and scalo s ( 1998 ) imfs overproduce oxygen for most of the galactic lifetime .",
    "generally , models assuming salpeter s , tinsley s or scalo s ( 1998 ) imfs are found to predict far too high global metal abundances ( @xmath5 0.0240.033 ) , especially if the most recent measurement of this quantity in the sun is taken into account ( @xmath6 = 0.0126 ; @xcite ) . the scalo ( 1998 ) imf also leads to overproduce @xmath7he from the time of solar birth up to now , due to its high percentage of 12 @xmath3 stars ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "on the contrary , the remaining imfs all guarantee a good agreement between the model predictions and the data ( see romano et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "therefore , from simple gce arguments we conclude that the imf of field stars in the solar neighbourhood must contain less massive stars than the salpeter one .",
    "an extrapolation of the salpeter law to the high - mass domain is not suitable to explain the solar neighbourhood properties . this is not surprinsing ; _ indeed ,",
    "the salpeter slope of @xmath4 = 1.35 was originally derived for stars less massive than 10 @xmath3_.",
    "the observational properties of dwarf galaxies are better explained by assuming a salpeter - like stellar mass spectrum .",
    "this is true for both dwarf spheroidals ( @xcite ) and late - type dwarf galaxies ( romano , tosi and matteucci in preparation ) . on the other hand , the chemo - photometric properties of massive ellipticals at both low and high redshifts",
    "are better explained with an imf slightly flatter than salpeter s . in their pioneering work",
    ", @xcite showed that an imf with a power index smaller than salpeter , @xmath8 @xmath9 for 0.05 @xmath1 60 , gives an excellent fit to the observed colors of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "we find that the chemo - photometric properties of local and high - redshift massive spheroids are well reproduced with an imf slope even more similar to salpeter s , i.e. @xmath8 @xmath10 for @xmath11 1 @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .    in conclusions ,",
    "our gce models give us hints for ( small ) imf variations with star forming conditions .",
    "further studies have been presented at this workshop which seem to confirm our findings , from both a theoretical ( e.g. c. chiosi ; p. kroupa ; l. portinari , these proceedings ) and an observational ( e.g. s. lucatello , these proceedings ) point of view ."
