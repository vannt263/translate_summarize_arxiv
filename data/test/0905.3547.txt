    "the study of the time - evolution of a non - relativistic charged particle in homogeneous magnetic and electric fields has a long history in physics . in a quantum context",
    ", the treatment of the problem goes back to darwin @xcite , who considered the evolution of a gaussian wave - packet in a magnetic field , and fock @xcite who obtained the eigenenergies and eigenstates of a charged particle in an isotropic harmonic potential , subjected to a magnetic field normal to the plane of motion .",
    "if one takes a particle of charge @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 , moving in the @xmath2 plane in an harmonic potencial of frequency @xmath3 and subjected to a magnetic field @xmath4 , the hamiltonian describing the system is given , in the symmetric gauge where @xmath5 , by @xmath6+\\frac{1}{2}\\,m\\,\\omega_0 ^ 2\\,(\\hat{x}^2 + \\hat{y}^2)\\ , , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where the operators @xmath7 obey the canonical commutation relations .",
    "this simple problem has applications in the context of the quantum hall effect @xcite , where disorder and the coulomb interaction also play a crucial role .",
    "another field for which the study of this hamiltonian has proved fruitful is that of quantum dots , where the simple hamiltonian given by ( [ eq1 ] ) seems to give a good account of the @xmath8 curves obtained when a gate voltage is applied to the quantum dot @xcite , with corrections due to the assymetry of the confining potential and to the coulomb interactions also playing a role .",
    "for some types of quantum dots , such as inas / gaas quantum dots , the agreement between the theoretical and experimental results seems to hold for magnetic fields up to 15 t @xcite .",
    "the study of the evolution of gaussian wave packets also goes back to the first days of quantum mechanics .",
    "this study was first undertaken by schrdinger @xcite , kennard @xcite and also by darwin @xcite in the context of the harmonic oscillator , of a free particle and of a particle in constant electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this problem continues to attract attention to the present day in many contexts , see the review by dodonov @xcite .",
    "schrdinger considered the time - evolution of a minimal uncertainty state , i.e. a coherent state of the harmonic oscillator , in the terminology of glauber @xcite .",
    "these states have a wide range of applications in quantum optics ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where they act as the quasi - classical states of the em field , and in quantum field theory , where they are the basis of the phase - space path integral @xcite .",
    "such states and their derivatives have become important in quantum information processing in recent years , in the context of the manipulation of cold atoms in traps .",
    "it has become possible to reconstruct the wigner function of a coherent state of the center - of - mass of an harmonically bound ion @xcite .",
    "kennard has on the other hand considered the evolution of a more general wavepacket of the harmonic oscillator , what is now known as a squeezed state .",
    "important early contributions are those of husimi @xcite and infeld and plebaski @xcite .",
    "these later authors introduced the so - called squeezing operator and established a relation between the evolution of initial states for which the time - evolution is known ( unsqueezed states ) and states which are derived from such initial states by the application of the squeezing operator ( squeezed states ) .",
    "the generalisation of this relation to the fd hamiltonian in an homogeneous time - dependent electric field is the main result of the present paper .",
    "stoler @xcite proved that squeezed - coherent states are unitarily equivalent to coherent states , thus being minimal uncertainty states , but that their minimal character is not preserved by time - evolution , although the uncertainty periodically assumes the minimum value compatible with heisenberg s uncertainty relation .",
    "he also showed that the squeezing operator as currently written in terms of quadratures operators is exactly of the form given by infeld and plebaski .",
    "squeezed states play a proeminent role in quantum optics , see again @xcite .",
    "recently , they have also become important in quantum information processing both in a quantum optics context and also through the manipulation of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "see in particular reference @xcite for an up - to - date report of the state of quantum information processing using cold atoms and photons .",
    "besides the paper of darwin already referred , the time - evolution of states of a non - relativistic particle in homogeneous electric and magnetic fields was also considered by malkin , manko , trifonov and dodonov @xcite , who considered the dynamics of a particle in an homogeneous electromagnetic field in terms of coherent states , obtaining an explicit representation of the green s function , and studied the invariants of the system ; by lewis and riesenfeld @xcite , who also considered the invariants of such a system ; by kim and weiner @xcite , who considered the evolution of gaussian wave - packets in a magnetic field , subjected to an isotropic harmonic potential ( i.e. the fd hamiltonian ) , but also to sadle - point potentials , which are relevant for tunnelling problems .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we review the notion of squeezing operator and generalise the relation of infeld and plebaski to states evolving under the fock - darwin hamiltonian . in section [ secc ] , with a view to applications in the manipulation of cold atoms , we use the relation obtained to establish a relation between the wigner function of different states and apply it to the special case of squeezed - coherent states . in section [ secd ] , we present our conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ appendixa ] , we present a derivation of the finite frequency permitivity and conductivity of the fd hamiltonian that uses the same operator methods that are used in the main text but which lies somewhat outside of the scope of the main text .",
    "finally , in appendix [ appendixb ] , we derive the original infeld - plebaski relation through elementary means .",
    "we consider the time - evolution of the state @xmath9 , that obeys the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being given by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) and where the interaction hamiltonean @xmath13 of the charge with the external electric field is given , in the schrdinger picture , by @xmath14 .",
    "if one now expands the squares and groups the different terms of ( [ eq1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the giration frequency and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the angular momentum component along the @xmath19 axis .",
    "one should note that one can write @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the hamiltonean of the isotropic harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath22 , and also that @xmath23=0 $ ] .",
    "given the state vector @xmath9 , one can define the corresponding state vector @xmath24 , in the interaction representation , such that the two vectors coincide at @xmath25 .",
    "this state vector evolves acording to the hamiltonian @xmath26 , which given that @xmath21 and @xmath27 in @xmath12 commute , one can also write as @xmath28 if one now applies the time - dependent rotation , encoded by @xmath27 to @xmath13 , followed by the dynamics of the isotropic harmonic oscillator , encoded in @xmath21 , one obtains for @xmath29 : @xmath30+\\,e_{y}'(t)\\left[\\,\\hat{y}\\,\\cos(\\omega_r    t)+\\hat{p}_y\\,\\sin(\\omega_r t)\\,\\right]\\right\\ } , \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the components of the electric field in the rotated frame .    the wave equation for @xmath32 can be formally integrated in terms of time - ordered products of the integral of @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath33 .",

    "we obtain @xmath194 if @xmath195 .",
    "however , we obtain @xmath196 in the @xmath197 case ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "this result is physically simple to understand if one realises that , when a harmonic force is present , a constant electric field merely displaces the force center , whether a constant magnetic field is present or not ( a shift in the origin of the coordinates merely contributes a constant term to the vector potential , that can be simply gauged away ) .",
    "therefore , one will not observe a response of the velocity to the electric field in that case .",
    "however , in the absence of an harmonic force , the electric field pulls on the giration radius center as if it were a free particle and one does observe a transverse response .",
    "one should again note that the quantum and classical results obtained for the susceptibilities computed above and those obtained from the classical equations of motion ( [ eq7]-[eq10 ] ) are identical and , moreover , that the response to the electric field is purely linear .",
    "this result follows from the fact that the classical equations of motion and their quantum counterparts , the ehrenfest equations , are linear and can therefore be solved with respect to the field and the initial conditions . in this respect ,",
    "the system behaviour is trivial .",
    "however , the equality of results between the classical and quantum cases is limited to operators that are linear combinations of the coordinates and momenta . in the case of non - linear operators",
    ", one can still use the methods discussed in this appendix to study their time evolution . furthermore ,",
    "if one is interested in the evolution of wave - functions , as discussed in the main text , one should keep the phase factors that were discarded in the computation of average values .",
    "we give here an elementary demonstration of the relation of infeld and plebaski @xcite . if @xmath198 is the squeezing operator introduced above , it is easy to show @xcite that @xmath199 , @xmath200 , i.e. @xmath201 is a scale transformation operator that preserves the volume of phase space . using these identities , one can show that @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the space dimension ( two in this case ) .",
    "we now wish to consider the wave - function of a squeezed state evolving under the isotropic harmonic oscillator @xmath21 , i.e. the matrix element @xmath204 ( the discussion in momentum space is completely analogous ) . inserting a complete set of position eigenstates , one can write this quantity as @xmath205 where @xmath206 . using the identity ( [ eqb1 ] ) , one has that @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the isotropic harmonic oscillator propagator .",
    "note , however , that ( [ eqb3_1 ] ) is valid for an arbitrary one - particle hamiltonian .",
    "the harmonic oscillator propagator is given by @xcite @xmath209 now , introducing the scaled variables @xmath210 , @xmath211 , with @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , one can show , using equation ( [ eqb3_1 ] ) , that @xmath212 substituting ( [ eqb5 ] ) in ( [ eqb3 ] ) , one obtains @xmath213 which is the infeld - plebaski relation used in the main text . since the expression for the propagator in momentum space is entirely analogous to ( [ eqb4 ] ) ,",
    "the steps are identical to those above , except that @xmath41 is replaced by @xmath214 .",
    "one obtains @xmath215",
