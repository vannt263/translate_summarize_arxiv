    "circular planar electrical networks were studied by curtis - ingerman - morrow @xcite and de verdire - gitler - vertigan @xcite .",

    "* theorem 4 ) as the symmetric matrices with row sums equal to zero and _ circular minors _ non - negative .",
    "furthermore , the circular minors which are strictly positive can be identified combinatorially using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.2 ) .",
    "this positivity condition is of particular interest to us , and the goal of this paper is to investigate the connections between electrical networks and other positivity phenomena in the literature . until now",
    ", the combinatorial properties of these response matrices have remained largely unstudied , despite their inherently combinatorial descriptions .",
    "a natural question that arises is : which sets of circular minors can be positive , while the others are zero ?",
    "it is clear ( for example , from the grassmann - plcker relations ) that one can not construct response matrices with arbitrary sets of positive circular minors .",
    "postnikov @xcite studied a similar question in the _ totally nonnegative grassmannian _ , as follows : for @xmath2 matrices @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and all @xmath5 minors nonnegative , which sets ( in fact , matroids ) of @xmath5 minors can be the set of positive minors of @xmath3 ?",
    "these sets , called _ positroids _ by knutson - lam - speyer @xcite , were found in @xcite to index many interesting combinatorial objects .",
    "two of these objects , plabic graphs and alternating strand diagrams , are highly similar to circular planar electrial networks and medial graphs , respectively , which we study in this paper .",
    "our introduction of _ electrical positroids _ is therefore a natural extension of the theory of positroids .",
    "we give a novel axiomatization of electrical positroids , motivated by the grassmann - plcker relations , and prove the following :    a set @xmath6 of circular pairs is the set of positive circular minors of a response matrix if and only if @xmath6 is an electrical positroid .",
    "another point of interest is that of _ positivity tests _ for response matrices . in @xcite ,",
    "fomin - zelevinsky describe various positivity tests for _ totally positive matrices _ : given an @xmath1 matrix , there exist sets of @xmath7 minors whose positivity implies the positivity of all minors",
    ". these sets of minors are described combinatorially by _",
    "double wiring diagrams_. fomin - zelevinsky later introduced _",
    "cluster algebras _ in @xcite , in part , to study similar positivity phenomena .",
    "in particular , their double wiring diagrams fit naturally within the realm of cluster algebras as manifestations of certain cluster algebra mutations .    in a similar way",
    ", we describe sets of @xmath8 minors of an @xmath1 matrix @xmath9 whose positivity implies the positivity of all circular minors , that is , that @xmath9 is a response matrix for a top - rank ( in @xmath10 , as defined in @xcite ) electrical network .",
    "some such sets were first described by kenyon - wilson @xcite . however , these sets do not form clusters in a cluster algebra . instead",
    ", they form clusters in a _",
    "laurent phenomenon ( lp ) algebra _ , a notion introduced by lam - pylyavskyy in @xcite .",
    "this observation leads to the last of our main theorems :    there exists an lp algebra @xmath11 , isomorphic to the polynomial ring on @xmath8 generators , with an initial seed @xmath12 of diametric circular minors .",
    "@xmath12 is a positivity test for circular minors , and furthermore , all `` plcker clusters '' in @xmath11 , that is , clusters of circular minors , are positivity tests .    in proving theorem [ lpalg ] , we find that @xmath11 is , in a sense , `` double - covered '' by a cluster algebra @xmath13 that behaves very much like @xmath11 when we restrict to certain types of mutations .",
    "further investigation of the clusters leads to an analogue of weak separation , as studied by oh - speyer - postnikov @xcite and scott @xcite .",
    "conjecturally , the `` plcker clusters , '' of @xmath11 correspond exactly to the maximal pairwise weakly separated sets of circular pairs . furthermore",
    ", we conjecture that these maximal pairwise weakly separated sets are related to each other by mutations corresponding to the grasmann - plcker relations .",
    "while we establish several weak forms of the conjecture , the general statement remains open .",
    "the roadmap of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing terminology and known results in  [ defs ] , referring the reader to @xcite for a more detailed exposition . in  [ circpos ] , we motivate and introduce electrical positroids , and prove theorem [ circposthm ] . in  [ lpsec ] , using positivity tests as a springboard , we construct @xmath11 and prove theorem [ lpalg ] , and conclude by establishing weak forms of conjecture [ wsconj ] , which relates the clusters of @xmath11 to positivity tests and our new analogue of weak separation .",
    "we recommend that the reader begin by reviewing the definitions and notational conventions from @xcite . for convenience , we re - state some of the more important definitions and results that we will use in this paper .",
