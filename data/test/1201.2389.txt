    "such high temperatures are required to eliminate defects ( gas bubbles and unmolten sand grains ) , and to homogenize the melt .",
    "parameters such as the grain size of raw materials are known to influence the quality of glasses  @xcite .",
    "however , little direct information is available concerning the complex interplay between the geometry of the system and the rate of chemical reactions taking place during the earliest stages of melting .    in this respect , _ in - situ _ high - temperature tomographic x - ray imaging  @xcite is a potentially powerful technique as it provides the possibility to : a ) quantitatively describe the distribution of grains and the nature of solid - solid contacts in the initial pile ; b ) identify where and at what temperature reactions between grains occur ; c ) quantify the extent to which these reactions occur .",
    "this technique has been employed in the past to study the evolution of powder compacts during the sintering of glass beads  @xcite or metallic powders  @xcite .",
    "however , no tomographic data have been acquired concerning a high temperature system involving chemical reactions between grains and the irreversible formation of a liquid .",
    "an _ in - situ _ microtomography experiment has been performed on the id15a beamline at the european synchotron radiation facility ( esrf ) .",

    "a mixture of ronceveaux silica sand , solvay@xmath5 sodium carbonate and saint - germain calcium carbonate was poured into a 2-mm - diameter silica crucible .",
    "weight percentages of these three materials were 64 , 19 and 17 respectively , and each material had a characteristic grain - size of : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 for sand , sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system]a and supplementary movie ) .",
    "such grain sizes are consistent with those used by the glass making industry .",
    "the sample was first heated from room temperature to @xmath9c at a rate of 70 @xmath10c / min , during which rapid thermal dilation prevented imaging .",
    "above that temperature , the sample was heated at 5 @xmath10c / min up to @xmath11c .",
    "3-d scans of the sample were acquired every @xmath12c , providing a direct picture of the evolution of the microstructure of the system , as illustrated in fig .",

    "sodium carbonate grains are characterized by their large internal porosity ( red grains in fig .",
    "[ fig : system]a ) .",
    "our data reveal the importance of solid - state reactions before the first appearance of melts . between room temperature and @xmath13c ,",
    "many sodium carbonate grains have unexpectedly broken up ( fig .",

    "this dramatic change in morphology continues with increasing temperature , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenar_carbo ] for the reaction between a sodium carbonate grain ( in red ) , and two sand grains ( in yellow and blue ) . as temperature increases , the original sodium carbonate grain shrinks , with the appearance of a jagged and fuzzy reaction layer ( shown in white ) .",
    "this newly formed material sticks to either of the adjacent sand grains and the residual carbonate grain moves , seemingly attracted to unreacted parts of the sand grains . a large fraction of the sand grains is rapidly covered in a loose shell of the new high porosity material ( fig .  [ fig : scenar_carbo ] ) .",
    "consideration of the relevant phase diagrams ( see supplementary materials ) and data from the literature including thermogravimetric experiments  @xcite , in - situ x - ray diffraction  @xcite and in - situ nmr  @xcite all suggest that formation of crystalline sodium silicates ( @xmath14 and/or @xmath15 ) is responsible for this fragmentation",
    ". furthermore , a second type of solid - state reaction occurs involving the two carbonates .",
    "although only a minority fraction is concerned , some grains of @xmath16 grains are found to react with @xmath17 at temperatures below @xmath13c to form a new compound ( fig .",
    "[ fig : calcium]a , b ) .",
    "it has been suggested in the literature that formation of a na - ca double carbonate is possible  @xcite , but no direct evidence for such a reaction had been found when silica is present .",
    "c , and @xmath18c .",
    "the calcium carbonate grain ( delineated in yellow in ( b ) and indicated by the presence of additional facets ) is incorporated into its larger neighbor , suggesting the formation of a double carbonate . at @xmath18c , the eutectic melting of sodium carbonate and the double carbonate produces a carbonate liquid , as shown by the absence of porosity on the right part of the grain .",

    "two major drops occur around the eutectic temperatures between sodium metasilicate ( ns ) and sodium disilicate ( @xmath20 ) , and the melting temperature of sodium carbonate .",
    "[ fig : sand_attacks ] ]    inspection of the different evolutions of grains shows that the occurrence of such solid - state reactions is conditioned by the proximity of sand and calcium carbonate to sodium carbonate .",
    "consideration of the statistics of contact types demonstrates that in the initial packing , 28 sand grains ( out of 108 ) and 18 calcium carbonate grains ( out of 56 ) did not have any contact with a sodium carbonate grain .",
    "the volumes of 47 individual silica grains have been compared at room temperature and at @xmath21c ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sand_attacks]a ) .",
    "these grains are a mixture of grains with and without contacts with sodium carbonate .",
    "we find that a little over 30 of these grains show a volume increase of @xmath22 ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sand_attacks]a ) corresponding to that expected from the @xmath23 to @xmath24 transition of quartz . on the other hand , approximately one third of the original sand grains have experienced a volume increase smaller than 8% , or even a significant volume decrease .",
    "the grains concerned are found to be systematically surrounded by the fine grained phase produced from sodium carbonate .",
    "it is found that at least one sodium carbonate neighbor at room temperature is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a sand grain to have decreased in size at @xmath21c .",
    "only about one half of the original sand - sodium carbonate contacts are concerned by a loss in volume of the sand grain at @xmath21c , probably because some of the contacts are lost when sodium carbonate starts reacting and moving , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenar_carbo ] . concerning calcium carbonate , given the large fraction of sand and the reaction - induced elimination of sodium carbonate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scenar_carbo ] ) , the majority of calcium carbonate grains are not in contact with sodium carbonate .",
    "such grains isolated from @xmath17 are observed to simply lose their @xmath25 , producing refractory grains of @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system]d ) , in contrast to the reactive pathway shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calcium ] .",
    "the appearance of the first melts appears to be determined by the solid - state reactions . even at @xmath21c",
    "certain sand grains show textural evidence for the presence of a small amount of liquid ( highlighted by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : system]b ) , despite the fact that the lowest stable eutectic in the @xmath27 system is at @xmath28c  @xcite .",
    "the presence of liquid at such low temperature may be explained by the existence of a metastable eutectic between sodium metasilicate and silica ( see supplementary materials ) .",
    "quantification of the amount of liquid is not possible directly , but may be estimated indirectly from the evolution of the amount of texturally distinctive sodium carbonate and associated secondary phases ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : system]b ) .",
    "the proportion of these porous phases increases up to @xmath29c ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sand_attacks]b ) , interpreted to reflect the conversion of sand grains to sodium silicates . from @xmath30 to @xmath29 c , we observe in places a scarce production of liquid between some of the sand grains ; nevertheless , the production of crystalline phases is much more important than the production of liquid , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : sand_attacks]b .",
    "despite the large fraction of silica in the final glass composition ( 75% ) , we do not observe any significant formation of melts around @xmath28c , the eutectic temperature between silica and sodium disilicate .",
    "however , at @xmath29c there is a sharp drop in the proportion of porous phases , and clear appearance of a significant amount of liquid around sand grains previously covered by a layer of fine - grained porous phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system]b ) .",
    "this temperature corresponds to the equilibrium eutectic between sodium metasilicate and sodium disilicate .",
    "the formation of this sodium - rich liquid is less favorable for glass melting than formation of the silica - sodium disilicate eutectic , which contains more silica , thus resulting in greater consumption of crystalline silica",
    ". these observations therefore provide strong indirect evidence in favor of the low temperature formation of both crystalline @xmath14 and @xmath15 . an even more abrupt decrease in the fraction of the fine grained porous phase",
    "is observed at @xmath31c ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sand_attacks]b ) , corresponding to the melting of sodium carbonate . the proportion of porous solids drops rapidly to zero afterwards .",
    "also , visual inspection reveals that at @xmath18c , the porosity of the few sodium carbonate grains that have cemented to neighboring calcium carbonate grains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : calcium]b ) is suddenly invaded by the presence of a liquid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : calcium]c ) .",
    "this temperature agrees well with the incongruent melting temperature of the na - ca double carbonate at  @xmath29c  @xcite .",
    "finally , our data offer insights into the generation of defects .",
    "quartz grains not surrounded by porous sodium carbonate or silicates below @xmath29c are found to have approximately the same size at @xmath32c as at room temperature .",
    "it is undoubtedly this population of grains that will remain as high temperature solid defects because of slow local diffusion . in the same way ,",
    "enhancing the formation of na - ca double carbonate will act to eliminate the generation of cao .    in summary",
    ", these _ in - situ _ observations combined with quantitative image processing reveal unprecedented processes of glass melting . from a physical point of view",
    ", the importance of direct observation is exemplified by the unexpected and dramatic effect of solid - state reactions on the spatial distribution of sodium carbonate , changes in microstructure that in turn lead to accelerated reactions compared to a fixed geometry . from a chemical point of view , many excursions from overall thermodynamic equilibrium are observed .",
    "short range packing arrangements have a profound influence on local reaction pathways , as most eloquently illustrated by the divergent fates of different calcium carbonate grains .",
    "the occurence of different reactions at different places strongly encourages the use of a spatially - resolved technique such as tomographic imaging in order to study glass melting .",
    "other metastable phenomena include the generation of liquids well below those predicted by the equilibrium phase diagram , and the observation of a eutectic transition in the @xmath33-@xmath34 phase diagram , which is not the closest eutectic to the mean composition .",
