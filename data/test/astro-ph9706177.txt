    "column densities in molecular clouds ( mc ) are estimated using the integrated antenna temperature of optically thin rotational transitions such as the j=1@xmath50 line of @xmath0co under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( dickman 1978 ) , adopting an empirical value for the [ h@xmath6/[@xmath0co ] abundance ratio .",
    "the lte calculations are based on a set of approximations that varies from work to work concerning the way to estimate excitation temperatures ( @xmath7 ) , the partition functions ( @xmath8 ) , and optical depths ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the empirical determination of the [ h@xmath6/[@xmath0co ] abundance ratio relies on the lte calculations , and on the empirical relation between gas column density and stellar extinction ( lilley 1955 ; jenkins & savage 1974 ; bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) .",
    "the conversion of the lte @xmath0co column density into total gas column density suffers from several uncertainties that we do not discuss here .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the true @xmath0co column density is underestimated by the usual lte approximations .",
    "although previous works have indicated that the lte approximations are good ( eg dickman 1978 ; park , hong & minh 1996 ) , real mcs have structure and kinematics that are far more complex than assumed in those works .",
    "the effect of complexity on the resulting spectra is investigated here .",
    "juvela ( 1997 ) , using more realistic density fields created with fractal models or structure tree statistics , has shown that the estimation of column densities is uncertain if the density structure of the cloud is unknown .",
    "padoan et al .",
    "( 1997a ) produced a catalog of artificial mcs containing grids of 90@xmath1090 spectra of different molecular transitions for a total of more than one million spectra .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a non - lte monte carlo code ( juvela 1997 ) starting from density and velocity fields that provide realistic descriptions of the observed physical conditions in mcs .",
    "the density and velocity fields are obtained as solutions of the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in a 128@xmath1 periodic grid and in both super - alfvnic and highly supersonic regimes of random flows ( padoan & nordlund 1997 ) . the resulting density fields span a continuous range of values from 0.1 to 10@xmath3 @xmath4 which produce column densities ranging over three orders of magnitude or more .",
    "these cloud models have been shown to reproduce the observed statistical properties of mcs ( padoan , jones & nordlund 1997 , padoan & nordlund 1997 ) and are realistic enough to allow a theoretical calibration of the @xmath0co column density .    for the purpose of this work we use six cloud models from the catalog of artificial clouds by padoan et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "we use 90@xmath1090 grids of spectra of j=1@xmath50 @xmath0co and @xmath11co lines from three 5  pc diameter artificial clouds and from three 20  pc clouds . for a detailed description of the construction of the synthetic molecular maps we refer the reader to padoan et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the structures seen in these simulations result entirely from the random character of the flows .",
    "the influence of gravity and heating effects of external radiation fields are ignored in these mhd calculations .",
    "over most of the calculated volume , the @xmath0co rotational transitions are sub - thermally excited in our artificial clouds . the excitation temperature , @xmath7 , is higher in regions of larger gas density .",
    "1 shows three slices of the 3-d datacubes illustrating typical images of @xmath7 of the j=1@xmath50 @xmath0co and gas density in the 5  pc cloud model .",
    "as expected , @xmath7 correlates with gas density .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 has a smaller dynamic range than the density distribution .",
    "the intensity scale in the density map is proportional to the logarithm of the density in order to compress the contrast .",
    "2 shows scatter plots of @xmath7 versus logarithmic gas density , @xmath12 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the mean excitation temperature @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 in both cloud models . however , the 20  pc models are a bit ` colder ' because they have larger regions of very low density gas than the 5  pc models ( see padoan et al",
    ". 1997a ) .",
    "the j=1@xmath50 transition of @xmath0co is therefore strongly sub - thermally excited .    in the following section we estimate the lte column density for these models .",
    "we estimate the excitation temperature from the peak temperature of the j=1@xmath50 transition of @xmath11co , at every spectrum in the 2d grids , adopting the abundance ratio [ @xmath11co]/[@xmath0co]=50 .",
    "the mean value of that temperature is plotted in fig .  2 as a continuous horizontal line .",
    "it is apparent that the estimated value of @xmath7 is about twice as large as the correct one .",
    "the j=1@xmath50 transitions of @xmath0co and @xmath11co can be used to estimate the column density of @xmath0co , under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "different authors made use of different approximations , when performing the lte calculations to estimate column densities from observational data .",
    "therefore we will determine lte column densities from our models in several different ways to reproduce the various methods presented in the literature .",
    "we briefly summarize the formulae that are used in the lte calculations ( eg dickman 1978 ; harjunp & mattila 1996 ) and we then add some simplyfing assumptions .",
    "the two basic assumptions are : ( 1 ) the excitation temperature is uniform along the line of sight .",
    "( 2 ) the j=1@xmath50 excitation temperature of @xmath0co and @xmath11co are the same .",
    "the excitation temperature , @xmath7 , is estimated from the formula :    @xmath15(1-e^{-\\tau } ) \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the background temperature , @xmath9 is the optical depth , @xmath17 is the radiation temperature , and the function @xmath18 is :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the frequency of the transition j=1@xmath50 of @xmath0co .",
    "@xmath7 is estimated from the formula ( [ 1 ] ) , where the peak radiation temperature of the j=1@xmath50 transitions of @xmath11co is used for @xmath17 , and the same transition is assumed to be optically thick ( @xmath22 )",
    ". then equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be used again , with the estimated value of @xmath7 , to determine @xmath9 in each channel , @xmath23 . the column density of @xmath0co in the ground state , @xmath24 ,",
    "is given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the channel width in km  s@xmath27 . to obtain the total column density of @xmath0co , @xmath24",
    "must be multiplied by the partition function @xmath8 :    @xmath28 \\label{4}\\ ] ]    to use equation ( [ 4 ] ) , it is usually assumed that the same @xmath7 is valid for all rotational states of the molecule .",
    "the formulae are taken from harjunp & mattila ( 1996 ) , and we call @xmath29 the lte column density estimated in this way",
    ". the optically thin limit ( @xmath30 ) is sometimes adopted ( eg park , hong & minh 1996 ) , which corresponds to the approximation : @xmath31 .",
    "we call @xmath32 the lte column density estimated under this assumption .",
    "another frequently adopted simplification ( eg .",
    "dickman 1978 ; park , hong & minh 1996 ) is the following approximation to the partition function :    @xmath33    ( penzias , jefferts & wilson 1971 ) .",
    "we call @xmath34 the lte column density estimated like @xmath29 , but with the approximation ( [ 5 ] ) . in some work ( eg dickman 1978 ) , equation ( [ 3 ] )",
    "is not evaluated as the sum of @xmath35 over all channels , but rather using the line center optical depth multiplied by the line full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "we call this case @xmath36 , where the partition function is also approximated with the formula ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath37 is calculated as @xmath36 , but the fwhm and the peak temperature are that of a gaussian fit to the line profile .",
    "all results are summarized in table  1 , where the lte column densities @xmath38 are compared with the true column density @xmath39 , that is the @xmath0co column density of the model clouds .",
    "the value of @xmath40 illustrates the typical error made with the lte approximation . on the average ,",
    "the most detailed lte calculations yield a value of @xmath29 that is about 65% of the true column density in the 5  pc cloud model , and 40% of @xmath39 in the larger scale 20  pc cloud .",
    "lte column densities estimated with additional approximations underestimate the true column densities even more with the worst case being the optically thin approximation , @xmath32 , although the j=1@xmath50 transitions of @xmath0co is optically thin in most of the map .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is an estimator of the ratio of total estimated mass and real total mass of the cloud . the best case , @xmath29 , yields 50% and 72% of the total mass of 20  pc and 5  pc models respectively ; the worst case , @xmath32 , yields 37% and 56% of the total mass for the same models .",
    "the estimated mean excitation temperature , @xmath13 , is lower than the kinetic temperature ( @xmath42 ) , but higher than the true mean excitation temperature of the model clouds ( cf fig .  2 ) .",
    "3 the probability distributions of @xmath43 are plotted for both scales .    in fig .  4 ,",
    "the value of @xmath44 is compared with the lte column density estimated in the same way as @xmath29 , but assuming a given constant @xmath7 of 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 k. if very low @xmath7 are adopted , the lte column density can grow to the point of overestimating the true column density ( cf harjunp & mattila 1996 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "if instead , the value adopted for the constant @xmath7 is close to the value of @xmath13 estimated with the peak temperature of @xmath11co , the constant temperature column densities underestimate @xmath39 more than @xmath29 does .",
    "moreover , the scatter around the estimated mean column density is always larger than for @xmath29 .",
    "fig .  5 and fig .  6 are log - log plots of @xmath29 versus the true column density @xmath39 .",
    "our models span three orders of magnitude in column density , a much larger range than can be sampled by observations when estimating gas column density using stellar extinction determinations ( eg .",
    "encrenaz , falgarone & lucas 1975 ; tucker et al .  1976 ; dickman 1978 ; dickman & herbst 1990 ; lee , snell & dickman 1991 ; lada et al .  1994 ; harjunp & mattila 1996 ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , our cloud models have been shown to be consistent with the known properties of mcs .",
    "therefore , we use these models to determine the scale factor @xmath45 that can be used to convert lte based column density estimates to a more precise estimate of the true column density .",
    "unfortunately it is rather difficult to fit the relations @xmath46 with simple mathematical functions .",
    "instead , we plot the calibration factors , @xmath47 , for @xmath29 , @xmath32 , and @xmath36 , in fig .  7 .",
    "when the lte column density of @xmath0co is estimated from observational spectra , it should be multiplied by the calibration factor @xmath48 .",
    "the lte column densities perform better at larger density , apart from @xmath32 that is good only in the optical thin limit .",
    "the often used and simplest lte estimate , @xmath36 , is rather good at large density , but it is up to 7 times smaller than the true column density , at low densities .",
    "several authors have produced synthetic molecular spectra using simple models for the structure and kinematics of mcs ( eg zuckerman & evans 1974 ; leung & liszt 1976 ; baker 1976 ; dickman 1978 ; martin , hills & sanders 1984 ; kwan & sanders 1986 ; albrecht & kegel 1987 ; tauber & goldsmith 1990 ; tauber , goldsmith & dickman 1991 ; wolfire , hollenbach & tielens 1993 ; robert & pagani 1993 ; park & hong 1995 ; park , hong & minh 1996 ; juvela 1997 ) .",
    "leung & liszt ( 1976 ) used a single micro - turbulent cloud and dickman ( 1978 ) a collapsing spherical cloud .",
    "models of many clumps moving at random velocities larger than their intrinsic line - width ( macro - turbulence ) were used by zuckerman & evans ( 1974 ) and by baker ( 1976 ) .",
    "macro - turbulence was recognized to be necessary to obtain centrally peaked co line profiles .",
    "macro - turbulent clumpy models include the use of different velocity and clustering laws ( eg kwan & sanders 1986 ) , increasing clump filling factor towards the center of the cloud ( eg tauber et al .",
    "1991 ) , variations of correlation length in the clump distribution ( albrecht & kegel 1987 ) , a description of chemical reactions and heating ( eg wolfire et al . 1993 ) , a low density warmer inter - clump medium ( park et al .",
    "1996 ) , density fields generated with fractal models or structure tree statistics ( juvela 1997 ) .",
    "although clumpy models have being useful to study the properties of mcs , they can only provide a schematic representation of the structure and kinematics of mcs , since their velocity and density fields are not solutions of the fluid equations .",
    "mcs are highly dynamical objects with a continuous range of gas density values and therefore a fluid description is appropriate and necessary .",
    "stenholm & pudritz ( 1993 ) and falgarone et al . ( 1994 ) produced molecular spectra from fluid models of clouds .",
    "stenholm & pudritz ( 1993 ) did not solve the mhd equations , but rather used a sticky particles code with an imposed spectrum of alfvn waves ( carlberg & pudritz 1990 ) .",
    "they computed molecular spectra under the simple assumption of lte .",
    "falgarone et al .",
    "( 1994 ) did not solve the radiative transfer equations , but simply calculated density weighted radial velocity profiles .",
    "they used a very high resolution turbulence simulation ( porter , pouquet & woodward 1994 ) , but with a low mach number ( @xmath49 ) and without magnetic fields .",
    "though these cloud models are solutions of the fluid equations , they are not a realistic representation of the physical conditions in mcs , because of the low mach numbers and of the low density contrasts .    in the present work we make use of highly supersonic mhd turbulence simulations where the density fields span a continuous range of values covering about six orders of magnitude .",
    "we perform the radiative transfer calculations with a non - lte monte carlo code , producing high resolution molecular maps ( 90@xmath1090 spectra ) for different molecular transitions .",
    "we have already shown in other papers that our cloud models are excellent description of the observed physical conditions in mcs ( padoan , jones & nordlund 1997 ; padoan & nordlund 1997 ; padoan et al .",

    "our main result is that the _ lte @xmath0co column density of mcs underestimates the true column density by a factor of 1.3 to 7 . _",
    "although previous works have shown that the lte approximations are good ( eg .",
    "dickman 1978 ; park , hong & minh 1996 ) , these authors found that in regions of low density , the lte column density is underestimated .",
    "our results are consistent with previous studies . in our more realistic cloud models",
    "the density has a continuous distribution and a large fraction of the volume is at very low densities where conditions are far from lte .",
    "as an example , in our models , only 20 - 30% of the total mass resides in regions where the density is larger than in the clumps modeled by park et al .",
    "on the other hand , the peak density in our model is larger than in park et al .",
    "( 1996 ) model .    in fig .",
    "8 we show that three basic assumptions of the lte calculations are not correct .",
    "the probability distribution functions of @xmath7 of different transitions show that : ( 1 ) @xmath7 values are considerably smaller than the kinetic temperature ( 10  k ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath7 of @xmath0co and @xmath11co are quite different ; ( 3 ) the @xmath7 along a single line of sight is not uniform , but has a broad distribution of values .",
    "it is not surprising therefore to find discrepancies between lte column densities and true column densities .    in this work",
    "we have treated the small scale ( 5  pc ) and large scale ( 20  pc ) simulations separately .",
    "the distinction is important , because the volume filling factor of dense regions grows with decreasing scale .",
    "the peak density in a simulation is independent of simulation scale but the mean density is lower in the larger simulations where the density contrast is larger .",
    "larger scales have stronger turbulent motions that cause a larger density contrast compared with smaller scales .",
    "therefore , the calibration of lte column densities , using a realistic cloud model , requires consideration of the length scales involved .",
    "observations have demonstrated that external radiation fields tend to make cloud exteriors warmer than their interiors ( cf .",
    "castets et al 1990 ) .",
    "the @xmath11co cloud ` photosphere ' ( where the line optical depth reaches unity ) tends to lie in a warmer region than the portion of the cloud where the @xmath0co emission is produced .",
    "thus , estimates of t@xmath50 based on @xmath11co tend to overestimate its true value .",
