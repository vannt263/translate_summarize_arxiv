    "the magnitude of finite metric spaces is a partially defined numerical invariant which was introduced by leinster via a category theoretic analogue of the euler characteristic of spaces , group and posets .",
    "if a finite metric space is scaled up sufficiently then the magnitude tends upwards to the number of points in the metric space and , typically , as the metric space is scaled down the magnitude tends to one ; this allows one to think of the magnitude as the ` effective number of points ' in the metric space .",
    "interestingly , magnitude has applications in measuring biodiversity ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in previous papers @xcite and @xcite we speculatively studied the magnitude of _ infinite _ metric spaces using finite subsets as approximations .",
    "whilst we do not know that the magnitude can always be defined in that way it seems to give meaningful answers for many subsets of euclidean space , both numerically and theoretically .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite it is shown using that approach that a closed , bounded subinterval of the real line can be assigned a magnitude equal to one plus half its length ; similarly magnitudes can be assigned to circles and to cantor sets .",
    "( these results are corroborated here in section  1 using the measure theoretic approach of this paper ) . in  @xcite",
    "the magnitudes of various simple subsets of @xmath1 and @xmath2 were calculated numerically and for various spaces considered it was observed that if the metric space was scaled up then the magnitude seemed to asymptotically depend on classical intrinsic volumes of the space such as volume and euler characteristic . for _ convex",
    "_ sets it appeared that this dependence held even non - asymptotically , so for a square it seems , numerically at least , that the magnitude is given by @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we look at the magnitude of homogeneous riemannian manifolds , using a measure theoretic approach rather than the finite subset approach mentioned above .",
    "the magnitude is calculated explicitly for the @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath4 with its intrinsic metric , leading to the following answer .",
    "r \\bigl(\\bigl(\\frac{r}{n-1}\\bigr)^2 +   1\\bigr))\\bigl(\\bigl(\\frac{r}{n-3}\\bigr)^2 + 1\\bigr ) \\dots \\bigl(\\bigl(\\frac{r}{2}\\bigr)^2 + 1\\bigr ) } { 1-e^{-\\pi r}}\\quad &   \\text{for $ n$ odd}. \\end{cases}\\ ] ] for a general homogeneous riemannian manifold @xmath6 we calculate the leading three terms in the magnitude as the manifold is scaled up : the first term is proportional to the volume , the second term vanishes and the third term is proportional to the total scalar curvature ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "writing @xmath8 for @xmath6 scaled up by a factor of @xmath9 and writing @xmath10 for the volume of the unit @xmath0-ball , we have @xmath11 this suffices to determine the asymptotics of the magnitude of a homogeneous surface , this asymptotic expression involving just the area and euler characteristic of the surface @xmath12 : @xmath13 this expression in the area and euler characteristic is precisely the penguin valuation of @xcite .",
    "there are a few things to note .",
    "the first thing to note is that although we use the measure theoretic approach rather than the finite approximation approach , we show that all the results of @xcite obtained using the finite approximations are all also obtained using the measure theoretic approach .",
    "the second thing to note is that in the cases that are known , namely the @xmath0-spheres and surfaces , the constant term is precisely the euler characteristic .",
    "this is particularly interesting as the magnitude arose from a category theoretic generalization of the notion of euler characteristic of various mathematical objects .",
    "indeed we might have named magnitude as `` the euler chacteristic of metric spaces '' if that were nt such a potentially confusing term .",
    "the final thing to note is that the intrinsic volumes , which are the terms so far identified in the asymptotic expansion all appear in the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel @xcite and , as the definition of is slightly reminiscent of the heat kernel , this looks intriguing . before giving a more detailed synopsis of the contents of the paper ,",
    "it is worth making some comments about the metric that we are considering on a riemannian manifold .",
    "there is potential for confusion here in that we are considering metric spaces and riemannian metrics , so the word ` metric ' is being used with two different senses . to reduce the likelihood of confusion , in this paragraph and the next paragraph we will talk about",
    "` distance metric ' for the metric on a metric space and ` riemannian metric ' for an inner product on each tangent space of a smooth manifold : a distance metric is a global object , a riemannian",
    "metric is an infinitessimal object . in order to define the magnitude of a riemannian manifold",
    "we need a distance metric on the manifold , we will be considering the intrinsic distance metric which arises in the following way .",
    "a riemannian metric gives rise to an arc - length function and this gives rise to a distance metric by defining the distance between two points to be the infimum of the lengths of the paths between the two points .",
    "if there is a riemannian embedding of a riemannian manifold in euclidean space then there are two obvious distance metrics , the intrinsic metric and the subspace metric : in this paper we are primarily considering the intrinsic metric whereas in @xcite and @xcite we considered mainly the subspace metric .",
    "so , for instance , on the earth , the intrinsic distance metric is realized by travelling over the surface of the earth , but the subspace distance metric is realized by tunnelling _ through _ the earth .",
    "we compare the asymptotics for the magnitude of the @xmath0-sphere with the subspace metric and to that with the intrinsic metric ; they are seen to have the same leading term but different lower order terms .    there",
    "now follows a more detailed synopsis of what is in this paper .      in section  1",
    "we define the magnitude of a metric space using a measure on the space .",
    "the key observation here is that if @xmath6 is a homogeneous metric space and @xmath14 is a non - zero homogeneous measure on @xmath6 , then the magnitude of @xmath6 is given by the following formula : for any @xmath15 , @xmath16 provided that the denominator is finite and non - zero .",
    "it is also shown in this section that the measure theoretic definition gives the same magnitude as the finite subset approach did for the circle , line segment and cantor set in  @xcite .    in section",
    "2 we give a brief exposition on the notion of intrinsic volumes of riemannian manifolds .",
    "intrinsic volumes are defined for a wide class of subsets of euclidean space and include such invariants as the volume , the surface area of the boundary and the euler characteristic . in @xcite and @xcite we mainly considered these for polyconvex sets  that is unions of convex sets  following klain and rota s treatment @xcite , but here we consider a differential treatment , utilizing @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one key point for us is that for @xmath17 a closed submanifold of @xmath18 these intrinsic volumes are intrinsic in the sense of differential geometry  that is to say they are independent of the embedding and depend only on the riemannian metric of @xmath17 .",
    "so for such a riemannian manifold there are @xmath19 intrinsic volumes @xmath20 , but it turns out that about half of these vanish because @xmath17 is closed , @xmath21 if @xmath22 is odd : the fact that @xmath23 can be explained by the fact that @xmath24 measures the surface of the boundary , which is of course trivial when @xmath17 is closed .",
    "the non - zero intrinsic volumes are also known in this case as killing - lipschitz curvatures and in a few cases are well - known invariants : @xmath25 is the volume of @xmath17 ; the next non - trivial intrinsic volume @xmath26 is the total scalar curvature ( tsc ) of @xmath17 ; and @xmath27 is the euler characteristic of @xmath17 . in general",
    "these can be obtained by integrating over @xmath17 a certain form defined in terms of the curvature .",
    "in section  3 we get to one of the main results which is an explicit formula for @xmath28 the magnitude of the @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath4 equipped with its intrinsic metric .",
    "( here it is slightly misleading to talk of the radius of the @xmath0-sphere as it is being thought of as an abstract manifold with the arclength distance metric and not as a subset of @xmath29 with the subspace distance metric ; however it is perhaps slightly less comfortable to talk of the sphere of curvature @xmath30 . )",
    "the formula has many of the properties you might expect , such as @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "asymptotically as @xmath33 , writing @xmath10 for the volume of the unit @xmath0-ball , we get @xmath34 this is certainly consistent with the asymptotics being described by the intrinsic volumes : for instance the alternate terms vanish and we pick up the volume , the total scalar curvature and the euler characteristic .    in section  4",
    "we see the other main result that for all homogeneous riemannian manifolds the first three terms in the asymptotic expansion are like those in the above expansion , further work will be needed to get more terms in the expansion .",
    "however , this is sufficient to show that for a homogeneous riemannian surface asymptotically the magnitude has the form conjectured for the asymptotic magnitude of metric subsets of euclidean space in @xcite and @xcite .    in section  5 the magnitude of the @xmath0-sphere with its subspace metric",
    "is considered .",
    "a closed form is given for @xmath35 , but not for general @xmath0 ; however , for general @xmath0 it is shown that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion is the same as for the intrinsic metric , namely @xmath36 , but that the next non - trivial term is different .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jonathan jordan , tom leinster and david speyer for their contributions to section  1 , as well as for other informative discussions .",
    "i would also like to thank mark meckes for comments on an earlier draft .",
    "in this section we first recall the definition of the magnitude of finite metric spaces in terms of weights and generalize it to infinite metric spaces using weight measures . we show that speyer s theorem for homogeneous spaces immediately generalizes and that this definition is consistent with previous calculations for intervals , circles and cantor sets .",
    "leinster introduced the notion of the euler characteristic of a finite category which is not always defined , but which generalizes many pre - existing notions of euler characteristic , such as the euler characteristic of a group or a poset or the cardinality of a set . then using lawvere s observation that a metric space can be viewed as an enriched category he defined the notion of the euler characteristic or cardinality of a finite metric space",
    " it was decided that these terms were already too overburdened , so we renamed the concept the magnitude of a metric space .",
    "this has the following definition .    for @xmath6 a finite metric space , a _ weighting _ on @xmath6",
    "is an assignment of a number @xmath37 to each point @xmath38 such that the _ weight equation _ is satisfied for each point @xmath15 : @xmath39 if a weighting exists for @xmath6 then the magnitude @xmath40 is defined to be the sum of the weights : @xmath41    note the following two things about the definition .",
    "firstly , the weights can be negative .",
    "secondly , if more than one weighting exists then the magnitude is independent of the choice of weighting ( a proof appears below in the more general measure theoretic setting ) .",
    "if you require a little intuition then one way of thinking about the weight equations is as follows .",
    "each point can be thought of as an organism , with the weight being the amount of ` heat ' being generated by that point ( a negative weight denoting some sort of refrigeration ) .",
    "each organism experiences the heat generated by the other organisms in a fashion which decays exponentially with the distance",
    ". the organisms each wish to experience unit heat and this is what is expressed by the weight equation .    we can try to extend the idea of magnitude to non - finite metric spaces . two approaches present themselves .",
    "* use finite approximation to the metric space .",
    "* use a measure in the definition of a weighting .",
    "the first of these approaches was explored in  @xcite and  @xcite . in this approach",
    "a metric space @xmath6 is approximated by taking a sequence @xmath42 of finite subsets of @xmath6 , which converges to @xmath6 in the hausdorff topology , so @xmath43 as @xmath44 .",
    "one can then take the corresponding sequence of magnitudes @xmath45 and hope that they tend to a limit , and furthermore hope that the limit is independent of the choice of approximating sequence .",
    "this seems to work in many cases such as compact subsets of euclidean space .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it can be implemented on a computer to obtain approximations to the magnitude of some spaces as in  @xcite .",
    "the second approach is the one that will be used in this paper .",
    "this was independently suggested to me by tom leinster and david speyer ( my own thoughts on the matter lay more in realm of currents and differential forms ) .",
    "the idea is to generalize the definition of magnitude using measures in the following way .",
    "if @xmath6 is a metric space then a _ weight measure _ on @xmath6 is a signed measure @xmath46 on @xmath6 such that for all @xmath15 @xmath47 if a weight measure @xmath46 exists then @xmath40 , the _ magnitude _ of @xmath6 , is defined to be the mass of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath46 : @xmath48    note that the magnitude , if it exists , is independent of the choice of weight measure .",
    "suppose that @xmath46 and @xmath49 are weight measures then @xmath50    it is worth giving a brief mention here to some connections between measure theory and riemannian geometry ( for more details see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath17 is an orientable riemannian manifold then there is a volume form @xmath51 , well - defined up to sign  the choice of sign corresponding to the choice of orientation .",
    "the volume form is defined by smoothly picking an ordered orthonormal basis @xmath52 for each tangent space , taking the dual basis @xmath53 and defining @xmath54 .",
    "integrating with respect to this volume form does not quite give a measure because of the sign ambiguity  think how on the real line we have @xmath55 .",
    "however , there is an associated measure @xmath56 , called the density , which obviates the sign problem . in the case of euclidean space",
    "this density is the usual lebesgue measure . as no confusion should occur",
    ", we will not distinguish between the volume form and the associated density .",
    "if @xmath17 is an orientable @xmath0-dimensional submanifold of euclidean space @xmath18 then there are two obvious measures that one might consider .",
    "firstly the riemannian metric on @xmath18 can be pulled back to @xmath17 to make it into an orientable riemannian manifold so we can use the associated density .",
    "alternatively , one could use the @xmath0-dimensional hausdorff measure on @xmath18 restricted to @xmath17 .",
    "provided that the hausdorff measure is normalized so that the @xmath0-dimensional cube @xmath57^n$ ] has unit measure , these two measures on @xmath17 coincide .",
    "one of the key tools of this paper is the following generalization of speyer s theorem on the magnitude of finite homogeneous spaces given in @xcite . recall that a homogeneous space is one for which there is a transitive group of isometries , or , in other words , one in which all of the points look the same .",
    "[ thm : speyer ] suppose that @xmath6 is a homogeneous metric space and @xmath14 is an invariant metric on @xmath6 then @xmath58 is independent of @xmath59 .",
    "if this quantity is non - zero and finite then a weight measure on @xmath6 is given by @xmath60 thus the magnitude is given by @xmath61    this follows immediately from the definition of magnitude .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that every _ compact _ homogeneous space has a unique - up - to - scaling , invariant , positive measure , thus has a well - defined magnitude .    aside from the calculations for the interval and cantor",
    "set given below , this theorem is the only way i currently know for calculating the magnitude of non - finite metric spaces .",
    "we can now look at the spaces whose cardinality was defined using finite approximations in  @xcite , and show that the same results are obtained using weight measures .",
    "these spaces are closed straight line segments , circles and cantor sets .",
    "we consider first @xmath62 the length @xmath63 closed line segment .",
    "the following was essentially told to me by tom leinster and david speyer independently .",
    "[ thm : intervalweightmeasure ] let @xmath14 be the lebesgue measure on @xmath62 the length @xmath63 line segment and let @xmath64 and @xmath65 be the dirac delta measures supported at the two respective end points .",
    "then a weight measure on @xmath62 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "hence the magnitude is simply :",
    "@xmath67    it is just necessary to show that the given measure satisfies the weight equation for every point @xmath68 . we can consider @xmath62 as the subset @xmath69\\subset { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] where @xmath70 , then for every @xmath68 @xmath71^y_a-[e^{y - x}]_y^b\\right )       = 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the magnitude is given by @xmath72 as required .",
    "now turn to the ternary cantor set .",
    "the following lemma , pointed out to me by jonathan jordan , will be rather useful in calculating the magnitude .",
    "it says that if we have a weight measure on a subset of the line which on some subinterval is a multiple of the lebesgue measure then if the subinterval is removed then a weight measure is obtained for the resulting space by putting simple dirac delta measures at the end points of the removed subinterval .",
    "[ lemma : measureonhole ] if @xmath6 is a subset of @xmath73 with @xmath46 a weight measure on @xmath6 with @xmath69\\subset x$ ] and @xmath74}=\\frac12\\mu|_{[a , b]}$ ] , then a weight measure on @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 so the magnitude satisfies @xmath77    we need the easy - to - verify identity @xmath78 to obtain @xmath79 .",

    ".    this can now be repeatedly to obtain the magnitude of the cantor set , and this agrees with the answer in @xcite .",
    "note that there the cantor set was approximated below via finite subsets , and here it is approximated above by subsets of @xmath82 $ ] with non - zero measure .",

    "now finish this section by considering the circle .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath100 the circle of circumference @xmath63 is given by @xmath101    this follows immediately from the homogeneity theorem .    in conclusion ,",
    "the confidence expressed in  @xcite when defining the magnitude in terms of subsets is now justified . in  @xcite",
    "it was unclear that the answers given for the cantor set and circle were independent of the choice of approximating subsets ; but they agree with the answers given here which are independent of the choice of weight measure .",
    "this section is a brief exposition on intrinsic volumes for riemannian manifolds ; these invariants are also known as curvature measures , lipshitz - killing curvatures , generalized curvatures and quermassintegrale .",
    "i will mention weyl s tube formula and the connection with total scalar curvature and volumes of geodesic speres .",
    "this treatment is mainly obtained from the books  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this section also serves to fix some notation and conventions .    in  @xcite , following   @xcite , we considered the intrinsic volumes @xmath102 as functions on polyconvex subsets of euclidean space @xmath103 .",
    "in fact the intrinsic volumes are defined for a much larger class of subsets of @xmath103 via the theory of curvature measures ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsic volumes can be defined for subsets which have an appropriate notion of unit normal bundle  a so - called normal cycle .",
    "this class of subsets includes smooth submanifold with boundary and more generally sets of positive reach . in general",
    ", the basic properties of the intrinsic volumes are the following .",

    "homogeneity : :    @xmath105 .",
    "normalization : :    @xmath106^i)=1 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath107 is the usual @xmath108-dimensional volume of @xmath6 and @xmath109 is the euler characteristic of @xmath6 .    for a closed smooth submanifold of @xmath103",
    "there are many formulas for the intrinsic volumes .",
    "the simplest formulas are for when the submanifold in question is a hypersurface @xmath110 . in this case , at each point in @xmath111 there are @xmath0 principal curvatures @xmath112 , and the @xmath113th symmetrized curvatures @xmath114 is defined to be the @xmath113th - elementary symmetric function in the principal curvatures : @xmath115 .",
    "the intrinsic volumes are given , up to factor , by integrating these symmetrized curvatures over the submanifold .",
    "more precisely , recalling that @xmath116 denotes the volume of the unit @xmath113-sphere , for @xmath117 , @xmath118 from this one obtains , for instance , @xmath119 .",
    "this allows us to calculate the intrinsic volumes of @xmath120 the @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath4 sitting in @xmath121 in the usual way . here",
    "all of the principal curvatures are the reciprocal of the radius , @xmath122 , so the symmetrized curvatures are given by @xmath123 and so , for @xmath117 , @xmath124    in the case of a submanifold of codimension greater than @xmath125 there are not principal curvatures , but the intrinsic volumes can be expressed in terms of the marginally more complicated lipschitz - killing curvatures",
    ". however it is still true that for @xmath126 a closed submanifold @xmath127 whenever @xmath22 is odd . from these curvature expressions , as weyl notes , a good undergraduate could derive the following tube formula . as an easy exercise ,",
    "you may wish to verify this for the @xmath0-sphere using the formulas given above for the intrinsic volumes .",
    "suppose that @xmath128 is a closed , smooth submanifold of euclidean space , that @xmath129 is the set of points of distance at most @xmath130 from @xmath131 , and that @xmath132 is the volume of the unit @xmath97-ball , then @xmath133    weyl s key observation , however , was that the intrinsic volumes of @xmath6 can be expressed purely in terms of its _ intrinsic _ geometry  we have already observed that @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",

    "let @xmath231 be the set of points at a distance @xmath141 from @xmath157 , then if @xmath232 denotes the scalar curvature of @xmath6 , which will be the same at every point , then we know @xmath233 because @xmath141 parametrizes distance , locally the volume form splits as @xmath234 .",
