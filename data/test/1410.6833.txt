    "critical phenomena at the nanoscale size follow a different behaviour than in bulk .",
    "a reduction of critical temperature with thickness is expected in magnetic films when their size is comparable to the characteristic correlation length associated to the interatomic magnetic interaction .",
    "this intrinsic effect is often hindered by unwanted changes in the structure and in the chemical composition , as well as by interface effects .",
    "the importance of interface parameters tends to increase with the constant seek for reduction of dimensions in technological systems .",
    "the complete structure of these systems is a key to properly disentangle finite size , bulk and surface structural effects .    due to its technological applications the exchange bias ( eb ) effect , which takes place at ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic",
    "( fm - afm ) interfaces , has been widely investigated in the last decades . below a critical blocking temperature ( @xmath3 )",
    ", the coupling between the two layers induces a shift of the hysteresis loop of the fm layer due to an intrinsic exchange bias field ( @xmath4 ) @xcite . despite its scientific relevance and its widespread use in magnetoelectronic applications , several aspects of this effect",
    "have not been completely elucidated , especially the assessment of the magnetic structure at the interface and throughout the volume of the afm layer@xcite .",
    "this latter is strongly influenced by the interface structural parameters @xcite as reduced coordination of surface atoms , atomic modifications induced by strain or chemical diffusion at interfaces .",
    "for example , an apparent discrepancy between the amplitude of the reduction of the nel temperature ( @xmath5 ) with the thickness in nano - periodic coo / sio@xmath6 @xcite and coo / mgo multilayers @xcite was explained several years later by the presence of an amorphous coo layer at the interface with sio@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    bulk coo is afm with @xmath5 of 293 k and a large magnetic anisotropy . in the paramagnetic phase , it crystallizes in rock - salt structure with @xmath7=4.261  .",
    "co and o planes alternate along the [ 111 ] directions , with an in - plane atomic arrangement given by an hexagonal mesh and an interatomic distance of 3.013  .",
    "the afm transition goes along a cubic - to - monoclinic crystallographic distortion . at 10 k , the monoclinic constants are a=5.18190(6 )  , b=3.01761(3 )  , c=3.01860(3 )  and @xmath8=125.5792(9 ) , with @xmath8 the angle between @xmath9 and @xmath10.@xcite in the pseudo - cubic face - centered setting , this corresponds to an angle of 89.962 between the two edges of different lengths .",
    "its magnetic structure is collinear with high spin co@xmath2 ions forming a stacking of fm planes coupled antiferromagnetically along the pseudo - cubic [ 111 ] axis .",
    "the moments are oriented in the monoclinic @xmath11 plane , pointing close to the [ 001 ] axis@xcite .",
    "this magnetic structure , usually denoted as afm ii @xcite , is stabilized by superexchange mediated by the oxygen atoms@xcite .    in films with nanometric thicknesses ,",
    "the coo structure is extremely influenced by the substrate , through the epitaxial strain and interface chemistry , as well as by the growth conditions .",
    "coo grows epitaxially on ag(001 ) with the same ( 001 ) orientation and bulk - like structure , except for a slight in - plane compressive strain .",
    "it grows pseudomorphic for a thickness of 4 ml @xcite but then it relaxes with the appearence of misfit dislocations . on pd(001 ) , gragnaniello et al.@xcite reported a modification of the coo cristallographic orientation and morphology as function of the coverage .",
    "meyer et al . showed the presence of a wurtzite - like coo bilayer at the surface of coo(111)/ir(100 ) films@xcite .",
    "moreover , on this substrate the growth orientation can be switched from ( 111 ) to ( 100 ) by the predeposition of a 1ml co buffer layer @xcite . on pt(111 ) , coo films are ( 111 ) oriented , and a moir pattern can be observed according to the oxidation conditions and thickness of the deposited layer @xcite .",
    "these structural differences are likely to strongly influence the magnetic properties of the films , as nicely demonstrated by a spin reorientation related to the nature -compressive or expansive- of the strain @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , the growth of coo on pt(001 ) has never been reported in literature . moreover , epitaxial coo film on pt(001 ) opens the way towards a coo / fept afm / fm bilayer on pt , since pt - terminated fept(001 ) and pt(001 ) present rather the same chemical surface .    in this paper",
    "we report epitaxial growth of coo films on a pt(001 ) substrate and on a fm ptfe(001 ) pseudomorphic alloy on pt(001 ) .",
    "we have succeeded at the growth of strained ultrathin ( 111)-oriented coo films on both pt(001 ) and pt - terminated ptfe(001 ) surfaces and have precisely determined the strain and the structure of coo layers with @xmath0 and real time surface x - ray diffraction .",
    "we find that on both surfaces the coo structure presents a slight monoclinic distortion stable at room temperature ( rt ) evocative of the low temperature and magnetically driven distortion of the bulk . at local scale",
    ", such a distortion translates into a tetragonal distortion of the octahedra formed by the first oxygen neighbors around co atoms .",
    "the implications of that distortion on magnetism and spin orientation of co@xmath2 ions is discussed .",
    "surface x - ray diffraction experiments at grazing incidence ( sxrd ) were performed at the french crg - if bm32 beamline @xcite at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) using a photon energy of 22 kev ( @xmath12=0.56354 ) .",
    "the ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) chamber , fully equipped for sample preparation , was working at a base pressure of @xmath13@xmath14 mbar .",
    "the pt(001 ) single - crystal substrate was prepared by cycles of 800 ev @xmath15 sputtering and annealing at about 1200 k. after preparation no impurities were detected by auger electron spectroscopy and sxrd showed large terraces of the typical quasi - hexagonal reconstruction @xcite .",
    "fe , co and pt were deposited by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , using pure rods inserted in water - cooled electron beam evaporators .",
    "the deposition rate , calibrated with a quartz crystal microbalance , was typically 1 monolayer ( ml ) per 10 minutes for fe and co , and 1 ml per 45 minutes for pt .",
    "coo films were grown with the pt substrate held at 520 k by reactive deposition of co , keeping a molecular oxygen pressure in the chamber of @xmath16@xmath17 mbar during evaporation .    the diffracted intensity as function of momentum transfer ( @xmath18 ) from a truncated crystal ( or an ultrathin epitaxial film ) shows sharp scattering line - shape parallel to the surface and continuous line - shape in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "these out - of - plane intensity distributions at fixed ( hk ) indexes of the surface mesh are known as ( hk ) difrraction rods .",
    "when originating from the substrate they are called crystal truncation rod ( ctr ) @xcite .",
    "the surface unit - cell is defined by the three vectors @xmath19 of a tetragonal body centered mesh related to the fcc substrate by @xmath20}$ ] , @xmath21}$ ] , and @xmath22}$ ] with @xmath23  .",
    "an ( hk ) ctr bind bulk bragg peaks with the same ( hk ) .",
    "when a film grows in registry with the substrate , film and substrate contributions interfere on the same rod .",
    "the film structure has to be resolved by a fine analysis of these ctrs intensities @xcite .",
    "it requires quantitative data , which are obtained by an integration of the scattered intensity at ( hkl ) nodes along the ctr , by rocking the sample around the surface normal ( ctr - scan ) .",
    "then the structure factors are extracted applying standard correction factors @xcite and averaged over symmetry equivalent reflections . the data reduction and structural analysis",
    "are performed using the ana - rod package that uses a @xmath24 minimization for fitting occupation profiles and interplane distances @xcite .",
    "after optimizing the growth procedure , two samples were studied in detail by sxrd .",
    "the first one is a nominally 3.5-nm - thick coo layer grown on a clean pt(001 ) substrate held at 520 k by reactive ( @xmath16@xmath17 mbar ) co deposition .",
    "the second one is a coo / fept / pt(001 ) double - layer film , where the coo layer is coupled to a fm l1@xmath25 ordered ptfe layer in registry with the pt(001 ) substrate .",
    "the fept layer was grown by evaporation of nominally 3 ml of fe on a clean pt(001 ) substrate held at 600 k , followed by 1 ml pt deposition .",
    "this strategy of fept growth steems from the fact that an atomic site exchange process takes place between fe adatoms and pt atoms of the substrate @xcite . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the process is reinforced and the fe adatoms interdiffuse into the pt substrate to form an epitaxial surface alloy @xcite .",
    "the additional pt monolayer ensures a pt rich interface with coo , intended to limit fe oxidation and produce a similar interface chemistry as for a clean pt substrate .",
    "the resulting ptfe(001 ) layer is pseudomorphic with the substrate .",
    "no traces of l1@xmath6 type ordered alloys or l1@xmath25 domains with the c - axis lying in - plane were found .",
    "then , a coo layer was grown at 520 k starting by deposition of 2 ml of metallic co followed by oxidation during 10 min and additional reactive ( @xmath16@xmath17 mbar ) co deposition up to a 4-nm - thick coo layer . for the analysis of these non - pseudomorph coo layers ,",
    "the intensity of the additional rods appearing between those of the substrate was measured simply by scanning the momentum transfer perpendicular to the surface ( l - scans ) .",
    "the structure factors were extracted using the so called stationary geometry corrections , after a background substraction @xcite .",
    "the structure of the coo layer turn out to be essentially the same on both pt(001 ) substrate and pt - terminated ptfe(001 ) fm layer .    to provide a fully structural description of the exchanged - coupled system , a total of 128 non - equivalent reflections belonging to the ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) , and ( 20 ) ctrs ( as indexed in the surface unit - cell ) were used for the determination of the atomic structure of the ptfe layer .",
    "the ptfe layer rods measured before and after coo growth show minor changes ascribed to some oxidation of fe at the interface . in order to estimate the extent of this oxidation , x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) at the fe @xmath26 edges",
    "was performed @xmath27 at the soft x - ray beamline of the esrf .",
    "all spectra were collected with a spectral resolution of @xmath28 @xmath29 and using total electron yield , corrected for electron yield saturation effects and normalized far from @xmath30 edges .",
    "reference scans were collected for the clean substrate prior to metal deposition .",
    "they show , besides the ctrs , additional rods coming from the typical pt(001 ) quasi - hexagonal reconstruction@xcite .",
    "after fe deposition , the reconstruction is lifted and scans of the momentum transfer parallel to the surface ( @xmath31 ) do not show any extra peak or shoulder close to the ctr .",
    "these measurements , repeated at different values of the momentum transfer perpendicular to the surface ( @xmath32 ) , ensures that the layer is in registry with the substrate , without any in - plane relaxation .",
    "the ctr structure factors reflect then the interference between the scattering from the fept film and the pt substrate .",
    "broad peaks have shown up between the substrate bragg peaks at @xmath33 @xmath34 for ( 1 0 ) and at @xmath35 @xmath34 for ( 1 1 ) and ( 2 0 ) ctrs ( pointed by arrows in fig.[fig : ptfectr ] ) , indicating a doubling of the electronic density period along the growing direction .",
    "these order peaks correspond to the @xmath36 phase with c - axis perpendicular to the surface @xcite .",
    "the lattice mismatch favours this orientated growth because the bulk fept @xmath36 lattice parameters , @xmath37=3.860  and @xmath38=3.713  are smaller than @xmath39 by 1.6% and 5.4% , respectively .",
    ".[table1 ] fitting results of a 4 ml fept alloy and its interfaces after cobalt oxide deposition .",
    "occupation rates ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and interplane distance @xmath42 to the preceeding layer are described for each layers . the last column ( @xmath43 / @xmath44 ) reports an estimation of the occupancies obtained thanks to wide angular scans performed at the superstructure peaks maximum . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the rt monoclinic distortion imposed by epitaxy for the coo films is of the same order of magnitude of that observed in low temperature bulk coo phase .",
    "the structure of these two phases can be compared within the distorted cubic cell , taking as lattice basis @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ( fig.[fig : coo_6 ] ) .",
    "the lattice parameters for both structures are reported in table [ tab film vs bulk-1 ] , along with the cell volume and the co - o coordination distances .    in the regular cubic structure ,",
    "co atoms are embedded in the octahedral crystal field of its first neighbors o atoms .",
    "the @xmath48 ions are in the high spin @xmath49 configuration , which leaves a hole in a @xmath50 orbital . at local scale , the tetragonal distortion , characterised by @xmath51@xmath52 , leads to a splitting of the @xmath50 orbitals by the orthorhombic crystal field@xcite .",
    "the elongation in the @xmath53 octahedron determines then the symmetry @xmath54 or @xmath55 of the empty @xmath50 orbital .",
    "the strong spin - orbit coupling completes the scenario and imposes the @xmath48 spin - orientation .",
    "experiments@xcite supported by theoretical calculations @xcite have demonstrated such a behavior .",
    "csiszar and coworkers@xcite established the dependence of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments of coo films on the strain induced by the substrate by comparing two cases : on ag(001 ) , the strain induces an extensive ( @xmath1 ) tetragonal deformation of the coo layer , leading to a @xmath48 spins with @xmath54 symmetry in the film plane . as opposite , a coo layer sandwiched between mno(100 ) layers presents a slightly compressive ( @xmath56 ) deformation and have its moment directed out - of - plane , along the @xmath57-axis .",
    "the remarkable difference between low temperature coo bulk and our films is the opposite @xmath51 ratio , reflecting opposite the tetragonal distortion . in the low temperature bulk structure ,",
    "the apical co - o interatomic distance @xmath58 is shorter than the @xmath59 distance and , based only on the orbital occupation and spin - orbit coupling energy , the spin should point along the @xmath57-axis .",
    "nevertheless , the spin orientation is sligthly inclined by about 11@xmath60 to 20@xmath60 from the @xmath61 axis @xcite . in order to minimize dipole - dipole interaction@xcite ,",
    "the @xmath48 spins , which are ferromagnetically coupled , tend to be within the ( 111 ) plane of the distorted cubic cell .",
    "the competition between spin - orbit coupling and dipolar energy leads to the sligth inclination .    in our films ,",
    "the apical oxygen distance @xmath58 is larger than the @xmath59 distance in the @xmath62 plane and the @xmath50 hole has @xmath55 symmetry . as a consequence , the spin should be within the @xmath62 plane , as in the case of coo / ag(001 ) . to completely define the spin orientation",
    ", we have to consider now the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the break in cubic symmetry is identified in the film by the decrease in @xmath8 in the monoclinic cell .",
    "such symmetry breaking sets the ( 111 ) plane apart , amongst the other \\{111 } planes .",
    "one can then deduce that this is the plane where @xmath48 spins are coupled ferromagnetically . to minimize the dipolar interaction@xcite",
    ", the spins should be within this plane .",
    "as opposite to the bulk case , both interactions are not competing and may be simultaneously satisfied if the spins align along the monoclinic @xmath63-axis , i.e. parallel to the @xmath64 ( fig.[fig : directspace ] and [ fig : coo_6 ] ) .",
    "such a conclusion , based solely on structural distortion and symmetry arguments , is in agreement with the experimental finding by x - ray absorption spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "one may note that the rt unit cell volume of the film ( 77.0 @xmath65 ) ( table [ tab film vs bulk-1 ] ) ranges between the bulk rt rock - salt ( 77.36 @xmath65 ) and the low temperature monoclinic ( 76.77 @xmath65 ) ones .",
    "the difference is small but may be of importance for the strength of the exchange interaction .",
    "the volume decrease leads an increase in orbital superposition and consequent increase in the superexchange interaction .",
    "this might be correlated to the exceptionally high ordering temperature of the film ( @xmath66=293 k ) and to the robust perpendicular exchange bias shift , kept up to the @xmath66 , as seen in our previous report@xcite .",
    "we have reported the growth and structure of ultrathin coo layers on pt(001 ) and ptfe / pt(001 ) surfaces .",
    "the cobalt oxide grows very similarly on both surfaces with ( 111 ) rock - salt - like orientation .",
    "its structure corresponds to a distorted hexagonal stacking with alternating planes of co and o and displays a rough surface . even then , the structure develops and keeps a monoclinic distortion in the ultrathin regime .",
    "the anisotropic epitaxial mismatch with the substrates leads to a stress that deforms the co hexagon along one of the main pt axis ; the second hexagonal layer formed by oxygen is also distorted and moves in the same direction .",
    "such anisotropy is at the origin of the monoclinic distortion when the coo film develops .",
    "the magnetic performance of our sample highlights the high - quality epitaxial growth control and the importance of the strain in the stabilization of the magnetic properties .",
    "the presence of the monoclinic phase , and the strain tensor elements of this phase , illustrates that epitaxy can be exploited to tune both the onset of the magnetic transition and the magnetic moment orientation in ultrathin films .",
