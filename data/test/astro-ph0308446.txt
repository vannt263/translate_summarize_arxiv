    "the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) mission confirmed the standard cosmological model to a very high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "wmap  _ data alone is consistent with a spatially flat model dominated by dark energy and dark matter , with nearly scale - invariant , adiabatic and gaussian initial perturbations consistent with the simplest inflationary models @xcite .",
    "one of the remaining outstanding issues is whether the shape of the primordial power spectrum is consistent with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this is usually expressed in terms of the slope of the primordial scalar spectrum @xmath4 and its running @xmath5 .",
    "most of the existing models predict that the slope is close , but not identical , to scale invariant , @xmath6 , and that running is small , @xmath7 .",
    "the best way to observationally settle this question is by combining data over a wide range of scales . combining data from _ wmap _ , the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) @xcite , and the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar ) @xcite , together with constraints from the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite ref .",
    "@xcite found 0.05 error on @xmath4 and 0.025 on @xmath0 , with scale invariant model fitting the data at 1.3 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite added lyman-@xmath1 forest constraints from @xcite and reduced the error on running to 0.016 ( as well as found evidence for running at @xmath9 ) , but ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the assumed errors were too small and the current lyman-@xmath1 forest constraints do not add significantly to the constraints from the cmb .",
    "the constraints on @xmath0 in @xcite were obtained assuming no tensor modes , the strong degeneracy between running and tensors in the current data complicates the interpretation of the one - dimensional marginalized probability distribution for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "other authors @xcite who did not use lyman-@xmath1 forest , also find no significant evidence for a running spectral index , with errors at the level of 0.03 .",
    "while the current data show no evidence for running , the errors are still large and will be improved in the future .",
    "the most immediate improvement will come from the sloan digial sky survey ( sdss)@xcite . the galaxy power spectrum analysis is not expected to improve the 2df results in a statistical sense ( but will be an important check of systematics ) , since on scales smaller than a few mpc the nonlinear bias becomes intractable . on the other hand , the lyman-@xmath1 forest spectrum and bispectrum analysis of several thousand quasar spectra in sdss will lead to an order of magnitude improvement of the lyman-@xmath1 constraints @xcite . in combination with the cmb this is expected to give an error of @xmath10 on @xmath0 .",
    "there are however uncertanties associated with the baryonic physics of the lyman-@xmath1 forest .",
    "future high-@xmath11 cmb data from the _ planck _ satellite ( and , to a lesser extent , measurement of the second and third acoustic peaks from future _ wmap  _ data ) will enable precision measurement of @xmath0 independently of the galaxy and lyman-@xmath1 data , but contamination from secondary anisotropies and foregrounds at high @xmath11 may be significant , since we are interested in effects of only a few percent .",
    "( the measurement of the first acoustic peak by _ wmap  _ is comparatively clean due to the large cosmological signal . )",
    "it is therefore desirable to have yet another probe of the primordial power spectrum at high wavenumbers .",
    "weak lensing is an attractive candidate since most of the potential systematics are related to the difficulty of the observations and are unrelated to the systematics associated with the other cosmological probes we have discussed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the constraints from future galaxy weak lensing ( cosmic shear ) surveys combined with the current cmb results on cosmological parameters , particularly the running of the scalar spectral index .",
    "weak lensing is one of the most promising tools for an era of precision cosmology as it probes directly the distribution of the gravitating matter and does not suffer from the uncertainties associated with nonlinear bias or gas physics ( for reviews , see and references therein ) .",
    "a few authors have used statistical inference theory to report forecasts on how well cosmic shear surveys combined with cmb data are able to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "see , for example @xcite .",
    "our goal is to extend these studies to include the running , as well as investigate the effects of possible systematics on the results .",
    "more recently , refs . @xcite combined cmb data from various experiments with the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) weak lensing survey data ( 53 deg@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "even with a modest survey , they found that their analysis reduces the uncertainties by comparable amounts or better than when the cmb results are combined with other types of probes because it breaks degeneracies present in the cmb data .",
    "their results are consistent with the earlier forecasts .",
    "other recent papers that reported statistical forecasts on how well weak lensing will be able to constrain various cosmological parameters include @xcite .",
    "the potential of weak lensing as a cosmological probe has been realized quickly and there are many ongoing , planned , and proposed surveys , such as the deep lens survey ( _ http://dls.bell-labs.com/ _ ) @xcite ; the noao deep survey ( _ http://www.noao.edu/noao/noaodeep/_ ) ; the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) legacy survey ( _ http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/science/cfhls/ _ ) @xcite ; the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( _ http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/_ ) ; the _ supernova acceleration probe _ ( _ snap _ ; _ http://snap.lbl.gov/_ ) @xcite ; and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; _ http://www.lsst.org/lsst_home.html_ ) @xcite . in this paper",

    "we have used the analytic approximation to the growth factor of ref .",
    "we used the recent nonlinear mapping procedure halofit @xcite to compute the non - linear power spectrum .",

    "are split in two bins : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the normalized source redshift distributions for these two bins are : @xmath67      weak lensing surveys today are subject to various systematic errors that are comparable to the statistical errors .",
    "one example is the shear calibration bias , in which the gravitational shear is systematically over- or under - estimated by a multiplicative factor .",
    "physically , the principal source of this bias is incomplete correction for the circularization of images of galaxies by the point - spread function ( psf ) , although there are also noise- and selection - related contributions .",
    "the shear calibration bias is particularly dangerous because the usual systematic error tests applied in weak lensing ",
    "e.g. decomposition of the shear field into @xmath68 and @xmath69 modes , cross - correlation of the shear map against maps of the psf , etc .",
    " are completely insensitive to this bias .",
    "indeed , shear calibration bias mimics an overall rescaling of the shear power spectrum , and proposals to circumvent it have thus far been based on detailed simulations of the observation .",
    "we have parameterized the shear calibration bias here using the power calibration parameter @xmath23 ; that is , the measured convergence power spectrum @xmath70 is given by : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the power spectrum obtained in the absence of calibration errors .",
    "note that @xmath23 refers to the calibration error of the power spectrum , which is twice the calibration error of the amplitude because the power spectrum is proportional to amplitude squared .",
    "when we consider tomography , we must also consider the relative calibration @xmath24 between the two redshift bins .",
    "this error affects the measured power spectrum @xmath73 in accordance with : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fraction of the source galaxies in bin a and @xmath76 is the fraction of the source galaxies in bin b. mathematically , this means that if @xmath77 , then the power spectrum calibrations of the two redshift bins are offset 1% relative to each other , but the calibration is correct when averaged over all the source galaxies .",
    "physically , @xmath24 parameterizes a redshift - dependent calibration bias , which could arise e.g. from an incomplete psf correction whose residual error depended on the galaxy s angular size or magnitude ( which correlates with redshift ) .",

    "are not completely unknown , but rather are parameters of the experiment that can in principle be determined by simulating observations .",
    "we have therefore imposed gaussian priors of width @xmath80 and @xmath81 on the calibration parameters ( for simplicity we have taken @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be uncorrelated in the case of tomography ) ; here the @xmath82 are the uncertainties in the shear calibration of the experiment .",

    "it is not obvious whether it is accurate enough for the present purpose : computing the derivatives of the non - linear power spectrum that are used to form the fisher matrix .",
    "@xcite effectively varied all the parameters we use here , but their sampling of parameter space may not have been sufficiently dense to constrain the interpolation near our point of interest .",

    "additional data ( such as spectroscopic redshifts ) and detailed analysis and simulations may be required in order to constrain some of these parameters . however , in some cases it is possible to obtain information about the systematics parameters from the data itself .",

    "note that this does not imply that the nonlinear mapping is sufficiently accurate for analysis of reference survey data , since the best - fit values of cosmological parameters can be significantly affected by small errors in theoretical predictions even if the fractional change in the fisher matrix is small .    in summary",
