    "electrons are characterized by their quantized spin and charge . in conventional electronic devices ,",
    "only the charge degree of freedom has been employed for the control of the electron transport .",
    "a new field of spintronics @xcite was born from both experimental and theoretical efforts to harness the electron s spin degree of freedom in order to control the electric current in the devices .",
    "one of typical spintronic devices is the spin valve which is a hybrid structure of ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal / nonmagnetic ( nm ) material / fm metal .",
    "the current passing through the spin valve depends on the magnetization configuration of two fm metals . in the collinear case , usually more current flows through the spin valve in the parallel configuration than in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "difference in resistance between the two is called magnetoresistance . in the noncollinear case or when",
    "two magnetization orientations are neither parallel nor antiparallel , the spin polarized current from one fm electrode exerts the spin torque @xcite on the other fm electrode , and induces the magnetization dynamics .",
    "examples of a spin valve are giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) devices,@xcite magnetic tunnel junctions,@xcite nanopillars,@xcite etc .",
    "in contrast with vertical spin valves , lateral spin valves are characterized by their multi terminal functionalities and so are more favorable for integration into semiconductor electronics .",
    "due to increased spacing between terminals , efficient spin injection and detection have been a very hot issue .",
    "the spin injection and detection experiments in the two - terminal geometry are obscured by other effects like anisotropic magnetoresistance , hall effect , etc .",
    "this defect was overcome by adopting the nonlocal spin valve geometry @xcite similar to the schematic device structure in fig.[3fmlead ] .",
    "the original spin valve devices contain two fm electrodes ( vs. three fm electrodes in fig .",
    "[ 3fmlead ] ) contacting the nonmagnetic base electrode . in this lateral spin valve system ,",
    "the spin transport was clearly observed with al wires @xcite by spatially separating the spin current path from the charge current path and thereby removing other undesirable effects .",
    "the spin polarized current flows from the left of n ( base electrode ) into f1 . that is , spin polarized electrons are injected from f1 into base electrode n and",
    "is drained to the left of n. due to asymmetry of two spin states in fm , the number of injected spin - up and spin - down electrons is different .",
    "flowing from the left end of n into f1 .",
    "the electrode f1 is called the spin - injecting probe , while f@xmath0 with @xmath1 will be called the nonlocal ( voltage ) probe in this paper .",
    "( b ) the one - dimensional model geometry of the spin valve system in ( a ) . [ 3fmlead],width=264 ]    in addition to charge current in the left of n ( @xmath2 ) , diffusion of injected spins generates spin current flowing to left and right of n symmetrically .",
    "pure spin current to the right of n was detected @xcite with another fm electrode by measuring the spin - dependent nonlocal voltage drop .",
    "the nonlocal spin injection and detection technique was also used to observe @xcite the ( inverse ) spin hall effect in diffusive nonmagnetic metallic strips . in these experiments , the spatial separation of charge and spin currents as well as the efficient spin injection are essential to observing the charge hall voltage induced by the spin current .",
    "recently experimental groups @xcite studied the spin transport in the lateral spin valves with the three fm electrodes as shown in fig .",
    "[ 3fmlead ] .",
    "f1 is the spin - injection electrode ( f@xmath3 ) as usual , while f2 and f3 are the nonlocal voltage probes located outside the charge current path .",
    "while the spin polarized electrons are injected from f1 into n and are drained into the left of n , the transresistance is measured between f1 and f2 or between f1 and f3 . in the former case , f2 is the spin - detecting electrode f@xmath4 and f3 is the additional electrode f@xmath5 . in the latter case , the roles of f2 and f3 are switched .",
    "the important issue is how sensitively the transresistance is affected by f@xmath5 .",
    "one experimental group @xcite found that f@xmath5 can drain the spin current and thereby significantly suppress the transresistance .",
    "they concluded that such additional fm electrode is relevant to the spin injection and accumulation in the multi terminal lateral spin valves . on the other hand",
    ", another group @xcite found that the transresistance is weakly affected by f@xmath5 even when the contact resistance between f@xmath5 and n is ohmic .",
    "moreover the transresistance was observed @xcite to be independent of the magnetization orientation of f@xmath5 ( parallel or antiparallel to that of f@xmath3 ) .",
    "they concluded that such additional fm electrodes are irrelevant to the spin injection and accumulation in the multi terminal lateral spin valves .",
    "the existing experimental results seem to be contradictory to each other .",
    "motivated by this experimental situation , we study theoretically the spin transport in the lateral spin valve with three ferromagnetic electrodes as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ 3fmlead ] .",
    "we adopt the semiclassical spin drift - diffusion ( sdd ) equation @xcite for the one - dimensional device structure and study the mutual effect of fm electrodes on their nonlocal spin signals such as nonlocal voltage drop and leakage spin current .",
    "we find that the efficiency of the spin current leakage into fm electrodes depends on the relative magnitude of junction resistance and the bulk resistance ( defined over spin diffusion length ) in fm and n electrodes .",
    "the voltage drop in @xmath6 is proportional to its leakage spin current with the proportionality constant given by the _ effective _ spin resistance which depends on the magnetization orientation of f@xmath4 .",
    "nonlocal spin signals are sensitive to the position of f@xmath5 relative to the positions of f@xmath3 and f@xmath4 .",
    "when f@xmath5 is located in between f@xmath3 and f@xmath4 , the transresistance can be either significantly or weakly affected by f@xmath5 depending on the relative magnitude of junction resistance and spin resistance .",
    "the effect of f@xmath5 is weak when f@xmath5 is located outside the region between f@xmath3 and f@xmath4 .",
    "even though the magnitude of the spin current and nonlocal spin signals may be modified by f@xmath5 , the flow direction of the spin current in the whole device is set by the magnetization orientation of f@xmath3 and so the nonlocal spin signals are independent of the magnetization orientation of f@xmath5 .",
    "this surprising result is already observed @xcite in experiments and is the direct consequence of no charge current in f@xmath5 .",
    "based on decoupling of charge and spin modes in the sdd equation and the kirchhoff rules at the junction , we also show that the relationship between nonlocal spin signals and magnetization holds true even in realistic three - dimensional samples .",
    "these interesting properties in fact originate from zero charge current in nonlocal voltage electrodes .",
    "irrelevance of magnetization orientation of additional fm electrode to nonlocal spin signals implies that even additional _",
    "nonmagnetic _ electrode can modify nonlocal spin signals in the spin - detecting probe .",
    "our theoretical study may be useful for clarifying the conflicting roles @xcite of an additional fm electrode in the lateral spin valve devices .",
    "in addition , our study is relevant to device applications , because the multi terminal functionality is essential for device applications of lateral spin valves .",

    "iv , our work is summarized and its relevance to experiments is discussed . some algebraic details and interesting results are included in three appendices .",
    "from now on we are going to confine our discussion to the collinear magnetizations of three fm electrodes in spin valves and so we consider the spin polarized transport in a steady state .",
    "the noncollinear magnetizations go beyond the scope of our paper since the current flow in the noncollinear magnetizations generates the spin transfer torque and induces the magnetization dynamics . in the collinear and diffusive transport ,",
    "the spin drift - diffusion equations @xcite have been very useful for understanding phenomenologically the spin polarized transport in the spin valve systems . later the sdd equations were derived @xcite from the semiclassical boltzmann equation under the assumption that the spin diffusion length ( sdl ) is larger than the mean free path ( mfp ) . using the numerical solution of the spin dependent boltzmann equation , the validity of the sdd equations",
    "was further extended @xcite to the case when the sdl is comparable to the mfp .",

    "<S> we study the effect of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) contacts on the spin accumulation in the lateral spin valve system for the collinear magnetization configurations . when an additional fm electrode is introduced in the all - metallic lateral spin - valve system , we find that the transresistance can be fractionally suppressed or very weakly influenced depending on the position of the additional fm electrode , and relative magnitudes of contact resistance and the bulk resistance defined over the spin diffusion length . </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal spin signals such as nonlocal voltage drop and leakage spin currents are independent of the magnetization orientation of the additional fm electrode . </S>",
    "<S> even when the additional contact is nonmagnetic , nonlocal spin signals can be changed by the spin current leaking into the nonmagnetic electrode . </S>"
