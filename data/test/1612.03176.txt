    "over the past few years , the increasingly stronger exclusion limits set by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) on colored top partners have put significant pressure on the classic solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the absence of beyond - the - standard model ( bsm ) signals has , at the same time , sparked a renewed interest in models of neutral naturalness , where the top partners do not carry standard model ( sm ) color charge .",
    "the prime example in this class is the twin higgs ( th ) model @xcite , where the top and gauge partners are complete singlets under the sm , and the sensitivity to ultraviolet ( uv ) scales is softened thanks to a discrete @xmath2 symmetry .    by construction ,",
    "the collider phenomenology of the lowest - lying states in th is very challenging , and rare decays of the higgs into long - lived twin particles typically constitute the most promising signatures @xcite .",
    "however , these signals display a strong sensitivity to the unknown parameters of the model that limits to some extent their robustness . for example",
    ", in the fraternal th model @xcite , where only the third generation of twin particles is introduced to avoid the cosmological problems associated with light degrees of freedom , the lightest twin glueball can be long - lived .",
    "it decays into sm particles through mixing with the higgs , with a width proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the confinement scale of twin qcd . as a consequence , the twin glueball",
    "displaced decays are observable at the lhc only in a relatively narrow range of twin confinement scales , while naturalness considerations allow a wider uncertainty on @xmath7 . on the other hand , a robust deviation from the sm is provided by higgs couplings modifications proportional to @xmath8 that arise due to the pseudo - goldstone nature of the higgs , where @xmath9 is the scale of spontaneous @xmath2 breaking and @xmath10 is the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "still , the future lhc precision on higgs couplings measurements will be limited to @xmath11-@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "altogether , these considerations suggest that it is not inconceivable that the lhc may remain blind to a th model with @xmath13 tev .",
    "the low - energy theory of th , however , requires uv completion at a relatively low scale @xmath14 tev .",
    "the extended theory necessarily contains new particles , some of which can give visible signals at colliders .",
    "while more model - dependent , these signatures may turn out to be key to the discovery of the model .",
    "for example , non - supersymmetric uv completions generically predict the existence of new exotic fermions , charged under both the sm and twin gauge symmetries .",
    "these vector - like fermions were already introduced in the original th paper @xcite , to cut off the residual logarithmic divergences in the higgs potential .",
    "furthermore , they appear in composite th completions @xcite , where they are resonances of the strong sector , and in uv completions with extra dimensions @xcite , where they are kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of bulk fields whose zero modes are removed through boundary conditions or orbifold projections .",
    "some of these fermions carry sm color ( as well as twin electroweak ) charge and can therefore be produced with large rates at the lhc or at a future @xmath15 tev collider , depending on their masses .",
    "the phenomenology of these ` exotic quarks ' was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that future searches for their signals can test large regions of the parameter space of the fraternal th .    in this paper",
    "we explore the phenomenology of other states that can be expected to accompany the exotic quarks ( which were labeled by @xmath16 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in a non - supersymmetric uv completion of th .",
    "we focus primarily on the mirror partners of the exotic quarks , which are vector - like ` exotic fermions ' that carry twin color and sm electroweak charges ( labeled by @xmath17 in ref .",
    "in addition we consider exotic vector particles , including both bifundamentals under @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the sm and twin weak groups , respectively , and bifundamentals under the color symmetries @xmath21 .",
    "the electroweak bifundamentals , which we label @xmath22 , are necessary to restore at high energy the @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) symmetry that protects the pseudo - goldstone higgs . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath25 bifundamentals , dubbed @xmath26 , appear in models where the sm and twin color groups are embedded into an @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "this is not strictly required for a consistent uv completion , so the presence of @xmath26 is somewhat more model - dependent .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , stop searches based on @xmath28 plus missing transverse energy ( met ) constitute a robust probe of the exotic quarks . given the absence of any signals in the first @xmath29 fb@xmath30 of data collected by each of atlas and cms at @xmath31 tev , we estimate that the current lower bound on the vector - like mass of the @xmath16 is approximately @xmath32 tev .",
    "if the masses of the exotic fermions respect the @xmath2 symmetry , as we assume in the first part of this paper , the same lower bound applies to @xmath33 , the mass of the @xmath17 . as a consequence",
    "the uncolored exotic fermions have a very suppressed electroweak pair - production , even at a @xmath15 tev collider . on the other hand , if the colored exotic vector @xmath26 is heavier than the exotic fermions , its decays can provide a sizable production rate for the @xmath17 .",
    "we sketch the corresponding phenomenology , finding that it is qualitatively similar to that of the exotic quarks : the most promising signature is @xmath34 , accompanied either by large missing transverse energy ( met ) or by the displaced decay of a twin particle @xcite .",
    "we find that the best strategy to pin down the presence of the @xmath26 and @xmath17 would be to require an additional @xmath5 boson in the final state , since this is generated very rarely in the decays of the exotic quarks .",
    "we also outline the phenomenology of the electroweak bifundamental vectors , showing that some of them can mix with the sm @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and therefore be singly produced in the drell - yan process . on the other hand",
    ", we find that the @xmath35 parameter of electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) requires their masses to be at least @xmath36 tev , implying that they are likely out of the lhc reach , but may be discovered at a @xmath15 tev collider .",
    "notice that from a phenomenological perspective , @xmath37 is independent from @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath38 breaks the @xmath2 only softly , thus preserving the cancellation of @xmath39-loop quadratic divergences in the higgs mass . since @xmath40 only couples to the sm through the electroweak interactions , the experimental constraints still allow it to be relatively light .",
    "it is therefore logical to analyze the region of parameter space where @xmath41 , to which the second part of this paper is devoted .",
    "we find that for @xmath33 in the few hundred gev range , one of the exotic fermions , @xmath42 , naturally has a very suppressed decay width .",
    "this implies that once produced through the electroweak interactions , @xmath43 pairs form bound states held together by the twin strong force , which eventually annihilate back to the sm .",
    "we study in detail the associated resonance signals , which provide a novel phenomenological aspect of th models .",
    "in addition , we consider the significant effects that a relatively light color bifundamental vector may have on the bound state decays .",
    "a light @xmath26 is expected to be accompanied by a light excited gluon ( for which we will use the name ` kk gluon ' in analogy to an extra - dimensional model ) in realistic models , so for completeness , we also summarize the main constraints on the kk gluon .",
    "finally , we inspect closely the consequences on naturalness of the @xmath2-breaking exotic fermion masses .",
    "while the @xmath39-loop effects are mild , we identify a @xmath44-loop quadratically divergent contribution to the higgs mass that can be important for light @xmath26 .",
