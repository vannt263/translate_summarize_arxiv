    "disk galaxies exhibit many designs : bars , rings , and spiral structure .",
    "the structure and placement of rings and bars are widely believed , on numerical and analytical grounds , to be governed by resonance .",
    "a resonance is a rational relationship between two frequencies .",
    "inner and outer rings form at radii that are resonant with the angular frequency of the bar pattern ( schwarz 1981 ; buta 1986 ; buta & crocker 1991 ) .",
    "a strong bar ends near its corotation resonance ( contopoulos 1980 ) , referred to hereafter as `` cr '' .",
    "many disk galaxies show spiral patterns , some of which are beautiful , two - armed spirals .",
    "what effect do resonances have on the appearance of spiral patterns ? first consider barred spirals .",
    "it was once widely believed that the bar was capable of `` driving '' spiral structure ( e.g. , van albada & roberts 1981 ) or of providing a source of disturbances that might be swing amplified into spiral structure ( toomre 1977 ) .",
    "then the bar and the spiral patterns would be resonantly related .",
    "but sellwood & sparke ( 1988 ) have suggested that spiral patterns need not be resonantly related to bars .",
    "kinematic data for few galaxies have been analyzed to see if the resonant link exists between bars and spirals .",
    "bar and spiral are part of the same pattern in both ngc1365 and ngc4321 , for example , but the transition from bar to spiral is at the cr in ngc1365 ( lindblad , lindblad , & athanassoula 1996 ) while it is at the inner 4:1 resonance in ngc4321 ( elmegreen , elmegreen , & montenegro 1992 ; sempere et al .",
    "1995 ; canzian & allen 1997 ) .",
    "apart from these two galaxies , there are differences between strongly and weakly barred spirals to consider , as well as differences between flat and exponential bars .",
    "spiral patterns exist in disks without bars , too .",
    "spiral density waves are constrained to exist between the inner and outer lindblad resonances , hereafter `` ilr '' and `` olr '' .",
    "aside from this constraint , the role of resonances in shaping pure spiral morphology is uncertain .",
    "many signatures of resonance structures have been suggested and used with varying success .",
    "dust lanes may jump to the other sides of spiral arms across the cr ( roberts 1969 ) .",
    "star formation may be less efficient within spiral arms near cr ( seen in ngc0628 and ngc3992 by cepa & beckman 1990 and in m51 by knapen et al .",
    "1992 but not in ngc4321 by knapen et al .",
    "enhanced star formation may occur in the interarm region at the cr , and at the inner 4:1 resonance there may be brightness minima in the arms and spurs should erupt in the interarm region ( elmegreen et al .",
    "1989 , 1992 ) .",
    "not all of the above prescriptions work in all cases .",
    "tests of the above prescriptions can follow only when clear determinations of resonance locations have been made for many spirals .",
    "confirmation of resonance locations requires kinematic data .",
    "such data derive from emission line mapping , which is difficult and time consuming",
    ". it would be more rewarding to study galaxies for which interesting resonance locations were known beforehand to be at easily studied radii in the bright disk .",
    "the cr is one of the most interesting resonances to study .",
    "this paper presents a test to identify galaxies whose cr is favorably placed for study ( within the bright disk ) .",
    "the test requires only moderately deep imaging in typical seeing .",
    "no rotation curve data are necessary .",
    "the test is not completely determinate : galaxies with cr within the bright disk can be missed .",
    "this is the price paid for operating in ignorance of the rotation curve shape and spiral pattern speed .",
    "however , the test is reliable : when a suitable galaxy is identified , there is a good chance that its cr is , indeed , within the bright disk .",
    "the basis of the test to identify galaxies with well - placed cr is presented in  [ sec_extensive ] .",
    "the section also investigates how much effect the shape of the rotation curve and the spiral pattern speed have on the outcome of the test . ",
    "[ sec_observations ] outlines the observations .",
    "the analysis of the imaging is described in  [ sec_analysis ] .",
    "this includes not only a description of the measurements made but also some surface photometry to estimate how deep the imaging reaches .",
    "the results are presented in",
    " [ sec_discussion ] , where promising galaxies are described and where the different characteristics of barred and pure spirals are discussed .",
    "spiral structure is constrained to be between the ilr and olr of the spiral pattern .",
    "the cr is between the ilr and olr .",
    "it is not known how often spiral structure remains relatively bright , or even optically detectable , at radii approaching the olr .",
    "spiral structure is probably detectable at the cr in most galaxies .",
    "we seek galaxies for which the spiral structure is not merely detectable , but is genuinely bright , at the cr . by implication ,",
    "the spiral structure would then stretch most of the way between the ilr and olr .    to test for placement of the cr within the bright disk , first measure the inner and outer extent of the spiral structure from deep imaging in typical seeing .",
    "when the measured ratio of the outer to inner extent exceeds the `` typical '' ratio of cr to ilr radius ( described in  [ sec_flatrc ] ) , the spiral structure appears to have needed more space than is available just between the ilr and cr .",
    "therefore , the cr is in the optically detectable part of the disk",
    ". the larger the measured ratio , the deeper into the bright part of the disk the cr might be .",
    "consider a flat rotation curve .",
    "( more realistic shapes will be considered in  [ sec_shape ] . ) at the cr , disk material has an orbital frequency equal to the angular frequency of the spiral pattern : the stars and pattern corotate .",
    "that is , @xmath0 at the cr , where @xmath1 is the pattern angular frequency , @xmath2 is the circular rotation speed , and @xmath3 is the corotation resonance radius . at the lindblad resonances , the material experiences the entire pattern exactly once each orbit . at the ilr",
    ", the material sweeps through the pattern , while at the olr , the pattern catches up with and passes through the material . consider a two - armed spiral pattern . at the lindblad resonances , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the epicyclic frequency , the @xmath6 sign refers to olr , the @xmath7 sign to ilr , and @xmath8 is the number of spiral arms .",

    "how does the shape of the rotation curve change the results of  [ sec_flatrc ] ?",
    "four functional forms for rotation curves will be explored .",
    "rotation curves that are not strictly flat lead to numerical coefficients somewhat different than , but still close to , those in equations  [ eq_ilrcr ] and  [ eq_ilrolr ] , so small violations of equations  [ eq_ilrcr ] or  [ eq_ilrolr ] are expected .    a rotation curve that is linearly rising or falling ( having functional form @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 small ) will alter the values of the `` typical '' resonance ratios ( equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] or equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ) .",
    "the changes are generally small and are independent of the value of @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig_4graph]_a _ shows the variation of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 ratios for @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath29 curve is asymptotic to @xmath32 and the @xmath33 curve is asymptotic to @xmath34 , diverging strongly only for very low pattern speeds .",
    "consider the following family of rotation curves : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rotation speed as a function of radius @xmath37 and @xmath28 and @xmath27 are free parameters . for small @xmath37 , @xmath38 is approximately linear , and for large @xmath37 , @xmath39 is approximately constant , thus approximating the shapes of many real rotation curves .",
    "graphs of the ratios @xmath29 and @xmath40 are shown in figure  [ fig_4graph]_b _ for the equation  [ eq_rcfamily ] family .",
    "the ratios are independent of the asymptotic rotation speed and the slope of the inner part .",
    "the ratios depend weakly on pattern speed until the pattern speed is a significant fraction ( over 50% ) of the value at the peak of the @xmath41 curve .",
    "the curvature of the @xmath41 curve ( see figure  [ fig_freq ] ) pulls the ilr to a smaller radius than for a flat rotation curve .",
    "the smaller inner radius , used as the divisor in equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] or equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] , will cause the computed value exceed unity . for the equation  [ eq_rcfamily ] rotation curves , the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] value reaches 1.71 when the pattern speed is 75% of the angular frequency at the peak in @xmath41 .",
    "( when the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] value is 1.71 , the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio is unity . )",
    "the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio equals 2 when the pattern speed is at 86% of the angular frequency at the peak .",
    "if the pattern speed exceeds the value at the peak , then there is no ilr , and spiral structure may ( in principle ) extend to the center of the disk",
    ". then the @xmath29 and @xmath30 ratios can be arbitrarily large .",
    "equations  [ eq_ilrcr ] and  [ eq_ilrolr ] will be called the `` canonical '' tests ; replacing the unit value of the inequality by 2 will be called the `` conservative '' tests .",
    "when the conservative equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] test is applied , we are protecting ourselves against the case ( a `` false positive '' ) of a galaxy with a non - flat rotation curve giving a false indication that its cr is within its bright optical disk .",
    "the power law is another family of rotation curve forms : @xmath42 many dwarf galaxies and a moderate fraction of low surface brightness disk galaxies have rotation curves that are well approximated by a power law out to the farthest observed radius ( de blok , mcgaugh , & van der hulst 1996 ; pickering et al .",
    "current thinking on galaxy formation suggests that rotation curves that have an inner power - law form will flatten out at larger radius ( dalcanton , spergel , & summers 1997 ) .",
    "but it is nonetheless worth while to derive the resonance ratio tests when the rotation curve is a power law , since it is possible that the ilr and olr are within the power law - like region of the rotation curve .",
    "rising rotation curves are given by positive values of the exponent @xmath27 , with small values approximating a flat rotation curve ; slowly falling but nearly flat curves are given by negative values of the exponent @xmath27 .",
    "for power law rotation curves , @xmath43^{1/(b-1)}.\\label{eq_powlaw_ilrcr}\\ ] ] and @xmath44^{1/(b-1)}.\\label{eq_powlaw_ilrolr}\\ ] ] graphs of the variation of these ratios with exponent @xmath27 are shown in figure  [ fig_4graph]_c_. although the ratios are a bit smaller than the canonical test values ( equations  [ eq_ilrcr ] and  [ eq_ilrolr ] ) for the smallest reasonable values of @xmath27 , the range between the canonical test value and the conservative test value includes most of the variation of the ratio graphs .",
    "consider finally the hybrid form ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1990 ) : @xmath45.\\label{eq_hybrid}\\ ] ] some examples of rotation curves of this shape are shown in fig .  4 in elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1990 ) .",
    "numerical solution for the resonance ratios led to the curves graphed in figure  [ fig_4graph]_d_. in this case , too , the range between the canonical test value and the conservative test value includes much of the variation in the resonance ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4graph]_d_.    in all cases of realistic rotation curve shapes examined above , most of the variation in the resonance ratios falls within the range between the canonical and conservative tests derived for a flat rotation curve . for many rotation curves , the ratio is smaller than that for a flat rotation curve ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_4graph]_d _ ) .",
    "the consequence of small ratios is that some interesting candidates may not be noticed .",
    "galaxies with such rotation curves might have only a modest extent of spiral structure as measured by the canonical test , yet the extent of spiral structure could be near the maximum allowed by the location of the lindblad resonances",
    ". such a galaxy would be missed by the test proposed here .",
    "although this circumstance decreases the efficiency of identifying promising galaxies , it also decreases the likelihood of incorrectly selecting a galaxy that does not , in fact , have its cr within its bright disk .      in a private discussion ,",
    "a.  toomre noted potential problems that might result by assuming a unique pattern speed for the spiral structure , as was done in   [ sec_flatrc]-[sec_shape ] .",
    "it is possible that the spiral structure is produced from spiral density waves with a range of pattern speeds about a well - defined characteristic pattern speed . there",
    "would then be both a general broadening of the observed pattern and an apparent penetration of the lindblad resonances of the characteristic pattern .",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "8 of toomre ( 1981 ) , a classic illustration of a swing amplified spiral density wave , where the inner parts of the spiral become tightly wrapped and appear to penetrate the ilr .",
    "the model was constructed from spiral density wave packets with a gaussian distribution of pattern speeds . to avoid the pitfalls of a spread of pattern speeds , only clearly defined spiral structure",
    "was measured for this paper , letting the seeing blur any high frequency interior structure , which was ignored .",
    "in contrast , spiral structure that is a mode of the disk may have a single pattern speed , as will spiral structure produced through swing amplification of a groove mode . in these cases , apparent extension of the spiral structure through lindblad resonance should not be apparent .",
    "ccd frames have been obtained for 140 galaxies .",

    "swing amplification ( see , e.g. , toomre 1981 ) of disturbances created by companions ( byrd & howard 1992 ) or a groove ( sellwood & kahn 1991 ) should create spirals that reach both their ilr and olr . if the swing - amplified spiral is a superposition of spiral density waves with a range of pattern speeds (  [ sec_caveats ] ) , then measurement of the extent of the spiral could lead to an equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio greater than unity , not less . but",
    "under modal theory ( see , e.g. , bertin et al .",
    "1989a , b ) , the innermost extent of the spiral would be the @xmath65-barrier , which is exterior to the ilr , thus decreasing the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio .    the best explanation for the low values of the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio involves the resonant interaction of spirals with bars and rings , as will be discussed below .",
    "there is a peak in the distribution of values of equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] near 0.5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_histo ] ) .",
    "most of the galaxies contributing to the peak are barred and ringed galaxies .",
    "the distributions of the values of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio are graphed separately in figure  [ fig_type ] for three morphological classes : pure spirals with no sign of ring or bar , barred galaxies ( which may have a ring ) , and ringed galaxies ( which may also have a bar ) including galaxies with pseudorings .",
    "galaxies showing signs of strong interaction , such as an anomalously long spiral arm and a probable companion , were omitted from all the distributions .",
    "for example , galaxies resembling arp  82 or arp  248 , which have long and obvious tidal tails , were excluded from the distributions .",
    "galaxies resembling m51 , which show a close interaction but no tidal tails , were excluded because the projection of a tidal tail nearly along the line of sight could masquerade as a spiral arm in such cases .",
    "galaxies resembling m81 were included in the distributions .",
    "although m81 has spiral structure that resulted from an interaction with a companion , its spiral structure is a spiral density wave in the disk and there is no sign of a tidal tail or other structure out of the plane of the disk .",

    "the values of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio are much more evenly distributed for pure spirals than they are for the other morphological classes .",
    "( pure spirals comprise less than one - third of the sample , making their statistics somewhat noisier than those for barred or ringed galaxies . ) the distributions of the equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ratio for barred and ringed galaxies , in contrast to pure spirals , are decidedly peaked at small values ( around 0.5 to 0.7 ) .",

    "in contrast , the ratios for barred and ringed spirals have a 97% probability of being drawn from the same population .",
    "the last statistic is not surprising , since many galaxies have both bar and ring features .",
    "( over half the barred galaxies in this study are also ringed . )",
    "a correlation between limited spiral extent and the presence of a bar can be explained if , in many barred spirals , the bar and spiral are resonantly related .",
    "modeling of barred spirals indicates that strong bars end at or just short of their cr ( contopoulos 1980 ; cf .",
    "also elmegreen 1996 ) .",
    "if the spiral patterns in strongly barred spirals had the same pattern speed as the bar , then spirals could extend only between their cr and olr .",

    "all bars are not strong , though .",
    "the relationship , if any , between the end of a weak bar and its resonances is not known .",
    "furthermore , it is not established that bars and spirals are resonantly related when they appear together in the same galaxy .",
    "so the rationale explaining why galaxies with bars tend to have less extensive spiral structure may be only a partial explanation",

    "combes 1996 ) , which is exterior to the ilr .",
    "limiting spiral structure to the range between inner 4:1 and olr also decreases the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio .",
    "other aspects of rings are neutral to the discussion or are problematic .",
    "the location of an outer ring at the olr ( buta & crocker 1991 ) does not place an extra limitation on spiral extent , and so does nothing to decrease the equation  [ eq_ilrolr ] ratio .",
    "many barred spirals also have an inner ring circumscribing the bar .",

    "the purpose of the project was to find galaxies for which the corotation resonance of the two - armed grand design spiral structure was likely to be within the bright optical disk .",
    "the likelihood that the corotation resonance is within the optical disk can be assessed by comparing the measured ratio of outer to inner spiral extent with the value of the canonical ratio ( equation  [ eq_ilrcr ] ) .    the test using the canonical ratio is not conclusive because of variations due to rotation curve shape .",
    "it is also possible that there is no inner lindblad resonance . to counter our ignorance of the rotation curve ,",

    "<S> spiral density wave theories demand that grand design spiral structure be bounded , at most , between the inner and outer lindblad resonances of the spiral pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the corotation resonance lies between the outer and inner lindblad resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the locations of the resonances are at radii whose ratios to each other are rather independent of the shape of the rotation curve . the measured ratio of outer to inner extent of spiral structure for a given spiral galaxy can be compared to the standard ratio of corotation to inner lindblad resonance radius . in the case that the measured ratio far exceeds the standard ratio , it is likely that the corotation resonance is within the bright optical disk . </S>",
    "<S> studying such galaxies can teach us how the action of resonances sculpts the appearance of spiral disks . </S>",
    "<S> this paper reports observations of 140 disk galaxies , leading to resonance ratio tests for 109 qualified spirals . </S>",
    "<S> it lists candidates that have a good chance of having the corotation resonance radius within the bright optical disk . </S>"
