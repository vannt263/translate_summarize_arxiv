    "we present a map of the water emission from the central portion of the orion molecular cloud obtained with the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( _ swas _ ) .",
    "these results provide the first definitive detection of water in the extended , cold molecular gas .",
    "the orion molecular cloud has been the focus of many studies of water , and besides the strongly masing transition at 22 ghz , numerous transitions of h@xmath1o  and h@xmath5o  have been detected from the ground @xcite , from the _ kuiper airborne observatory _",
    "@xcite , and from the _ infrared space observatory _ @xcite . with the exception of the broad h@xmath5o  line emission observed toward bn / kl by @xcite ,",
    "all of the transitions detected have upper states lying from 200 to 700 k above the ground state and many are likely masing . in most cases",
    "this emission arises from the hot gas associated with bn / kl , however @xcite report spatially extended emission from the @xmath7 transition of water at 183 ghz .",
    "_ swas _  observed the @xmath8 transitions of ortho - h@xmath1oat 556.936 ghz and of ortho - h@xmath5o  at 547.676 ghz .",
    "these transitions have upper state energies of only 27 k above the ortho - h@xmath1o  ground state , and thus are unique probes of water in the cooler molecular gas . the emission obtained with _ swas _  toward bn / kl @xcite",
    "is composed of both a broad velocity feature associated with the shocked gas and a narrow feature that likely arises from the quiescent gas in the orion molecular ridge .",
    "the abundance of water relative to h@xmath1  in the shocked gas is of order @xmath9 , making water one of the most abundant molecules in the hot gas .",
    "the focus of this letter is the kinematically narrow and spatially extended component of the water emission detected in orion .",
    "the observations reported here were acquired by _ swas _  during the periods from 1998 december to 1999 march and 1999 september to 1999 october .",
    "the data were taken by alternately nodding the satellite from the source to a reference position free of molecular emission .",
    "observations of the @xmath10 transition of h@xmath1o  were obtained at 40 positions in a 5 by 8 grid spaced by 32 . the reference position for this map was at @xmath11 , @xmath12 = @xmath13 ( j2000 ) .",
    "integration times were typically 2 hr per position .",
    "besides the h@xmath5o  spectrum reported by @xcite toward bn / kl , observations of h@xmath5o  were also obtained at a position 32 south of the map reference position where the h@xmath1o  spectrum showed a strong , narrow line .",
    "the _ swas _  beam is elliptical , and at the frequency of the water transitions has angular dimensions of @xmath14 .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard _ swas _",
    "pipeline described in @xcite .",
    "the data shown in this paper are not corrected for the _ swas _  main beam efficiency of 0.90 .",
    "we also used the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14  m telescope to map an approximately @xmath15 region in the @xmath16 transition of @xmath17co , a @xmath18 region in the @xmath16 transition of c@xmath19o , and a @xmath20 region in the @xmath21 transitions of ch@xmath22cch .",
    "these data are used to provide an estimate of the temperature and column density of the gas ridge for our analysis of the water emission .",
    "emission was detected in 23 of the 40 positions observed .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure 1 shows the integrated intensity map of the h@xmath1o  emission , which is dominated by the broad line width emission associated with bn / kl . because of the large and slightly elliptical main beam of _ swas _ , this broad emission is seen in five of the map positions . outside of these five positions the emission is narrow with line widths between 3 and 6 km s@xmath2 .",
    "figure 2 provides examples of h@xmath1ospectra obtained at three positions in the cloud .",
    "we have fitted the positions showing broad emission with two gaussian components and include only the integrated intensity of the narrow component in the map shown in the middle panel of figure 1 .",
    "the narrow line width water emission is elongated north - south , and extends 128 north of bn / kl to omc-2 and 64 south of bn / kl .",
    "the velocity of the narrow line width emission varies from @xmath23 to 11.6 km s@xmath2 , with a trend of increasing velocity from south to north .",
    "the line widths and velocity of the h@xmath1o  emission agree well with the emission associated with the extended molecular ridge and molecular bar .",
    "weak h@xmath1o",
    "emission also extends 10  east of the molecular ridge where weaker emission is detected in both @xmath17co  and cn @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 transition of h@xmath1o  has a high critical density ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ) and is expected to have a high optical depth even for a relatively small water abundance .",
    "thus , trapping plays an important role in the excitation of this transition . for large optical depths",
    "the `` effective critical density '' is approximately @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the collisional de - excitation rate coefficient , @xmath28 is the line center optical depth , and @xmath29 is the spontaneous emission rate . in the low - collision rate limit , where the density is much smaller than the effective critical density , @xcite and @xcite derived a simple analytical expression for the antenna temperature in a two - level system . in this limit ,",
    "collisional excitation always results in a photon that escapes the cloud , even though it may be repeatedly absorbed and reemitted .",
    "thus the gas can be optically thick but effectively thin .        applying this approximation to water ,",
    "gives the following expression for the integrated antenna temperature for the 557 ghz water line :    @xmath30    note that in this limit the integrated intensity increases linearly with increasing h@xmath1 density , @xmath31 , and ortho - water column density , @xmath32(o - h@xmath1o ) , even if the line center optical depth is large .",
    "we have evaluated equation ( 1 ) using the collision rate coefficients for para- and ortho - h@xmath1  from @xcite for a temperature of 40 k , assuming the ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath1  is in lte ( implying an ortho - to - para ratio of 0.13 ) .",
    "the ortho - water fractional abundance , @xmath33(o - h@xmath1o ) , is thus    @xmath34    where the integrated intensity of the water line has units of kelvins kilometers per second , density has units per cubic centimeter , and column density has units per square centimeter . if we assume that the molecular ridge has @xmath35 40 k , @xmath36 @xmath25 , and @xmath32(h@xmath1 ) = @xmath37 @xmath38 , then for a typical main beam corrected water integrated intensity in the ridge of 10 k km s@xmath2 , the relative abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  is @xmath39 .",
    "although the line center optical depth is over 10 , the emission is still well within the low - collision rate limit , so the emission is effectively thin .",
    "this estimate ignores beam dilution which could be significant in the 33 @xmath40 45 main beam of _",
    "swas_.    a detailed model of the temperature , density , column density , and velocity dispersion for the orion molecular gas is needed to model the water excitation and beam filling factor to derive accurate estimates of the water abundance .",
    "we have used our observations of ch@xmath22cchto derive the temperature along the molecular ridge in orion using the method described by @xcite .",
    "we find temperatures varying from 50 k toward the center of the ridge dropping to about 25 k at the boundary of the ch@xmath22cch  emission , consistent with temperatures found by @xcite .",
    "we have assumed a temperature of 25 k outside of the area of detectable ch@xmath22cch  emission .",
    "the h@xmath1 gas column density is derived from our observations of @xmath17co  assuming lte , the temperatures described above , and a @xmath17co / h@xmath1  abundance ratio of @xmath41 .",
    "the column density is derived on a 44  grid defined by the @xmath17co  sampling .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas along each line of sight is determined from the @xmath17co  line width .",
    "we have assumed that the density of the gas along the molecular ridge near bn / kl is @xmath42 @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the extension of the ridge north to omc-2 is assumed to have a density of @xmath43 @xmath25 based on the analysis of @xcite , and the density of the diffuse emission to the east of bn / kl is assumed to be @xmath44 @xmath25 based on the cn analysis of @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that all of the gas column density toward the orion core arises in the dense gas , consistent with the results found by @xcite .",
    "once the temperature , density , velocity dispersion , and h@xmath1  column density are fixed , the strength of the water emission is determined only by its abundance relative to h@xmath1 .",
    "we model the water emission using a statistical equilibrium code that uses the large velocity gradient approximation to account for radiation trapping .",
    "collisional rate coefficients are taken from @xcite using both the para- and ortho - h@xmath1  rates and assuming that the ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath1  is in lte  ratio of 3 ( the high temperature limit ) , the collision rates would be approximately 5 times larger and the derived water abundance correspondingly smaller . ] .",
    "we include the 5 lowest levels of ortho - water in our calculations .",
    "we proceed by assuming a water abundance , computing the water emission in each of the 44  regions , convolving the predicted emission with the _ swas _  beam , and then varying the abundance until there is agreement between the integrated intensity predicted by the model and the observations .",
    "we assume the h@xmath1o  abundance is constant across the _ swas _  beam . using this technique",
    ", we find that for the 23 positions where h@xmath1o  emission was detected that the average abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  relative to h@xmath1is @xmath45 , with variations between 1 and 8@xmath4 .",
    "for the narrow velocity component detected toward bn / kl , our results agree with @xcite . the largest h@xmath1o  abundances are found east of the molecular ridge near the molecular bar and h  ii region .",
    "we can also use the h@xmath5o  spectrum obtained 32 south of bn / kl ( see fig .  2 ) to estimate the water abundance .",
    "the h@xmath5o  spectrum may show evidence for a weak broad line width component similar to that detected toward bn / kl @xcite .",
    "for the h@xmath5o  observation the long axis of the _ swas _  beam was oriented nearly north / south and explains why the broad h@xmath5o  emission toward bn / kl may be weakly detected at this position .",
    "we have fitted the h@xmath5o  spectrum with two components , one matching the line width and velocity of the broad velocity component seen toward bn / kl and a second narrow - line component with a width ( 5.65 km s@xmath2 ) and velocity ( 9.0 km s@xmath2 ) derived from the h@xmath1oline detected in this direction .",
    "no evidence for a narrow - line velocity component was found in the h@xmath5o  spectrum , similar to the results found by @xcite toward bn / kl . using the same model as before ,",
    "the h@xmath5o  data sets a @xmath6  upper limit of @xmath46 for the relative abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  32 south of bn / kl , assuming a ratio of h@xmath1o / h@xmath5o of 500 .",
    "this result is consistent with the abundance of @xmath47 derived from the h@xmath1o  analysis .",
    "our modeling has ignored several potentially important effects : ( 1 ) pumping by the far - infrared radiation field of the cloud , ( 2 ) line scattering in a thin layer of gas surrounding the cloud core , and ( 3 ) clumpy cloud structure .",
    "the importance of radiation pumping can be easily estimated by computing the excitation of a molecule immersed in a dilute blackbody radiation field derived from the measurements toward bn / kl @xcite .",
    "even using the strong radiation field present within 1  of bn / kl , the fractional population in the upper rotational states ( 2@xmath48 and 2@xmath49 ) of water will be small , and thus ignoring this radiation will have a negligible effect on our estimates of the water abundance . toward bn",
    "/ kl , @xcite have more carefully modeled the effect of dust on h@xmath1o  excitation and confirm that for the extended emission ignoring dust has only a small impact on the derived h@xmath1o  abundance .",
    "line scattering is of even greater concern . because of the low excitation , but high optical depths predicted for this water transition",
    ", photons collisionally produced in the ridge may be absorbed and reemitted by an extended halo of low column density gas . in this case",
    "the abundance of water derived for the molecular ridge may be underestimated and the abundance of water in the extended structure of the orion cloud may be overestimated .",
    "the importance of this effect for hco@xmath50 was investigated by @xcite .",
    "the water line shape provides some constraints on this process .",
    "the water lines show no evidence for self - absorption as would be expected if absorption in a surrounding envelope is important . while absorption followed by emission",
    "is plausibly occurring , the photons would emerge in the line wings after a number of scatterings and most of the scattered photons would probably still be within the _ swas _  beam .",
    "the only exception would be if the absorbing envelope were spatially well separated from the emitting gas . nevertheless , even if scattering were having a large impact on the h@xmath1o  emission , it is not important for h@xmath5o and therefore the abundance limit established from the h@xmath5o  observation is valid .",
    "the orion cloud core may also have structure on scales smaller than modeled .",
    "if there is significant structure on scales smaller than 44 we may underestimate the optical depth of water in the high column density regions .",
    "this in turn , could cause an underestimate of the collisional de - excitation rate and consequently an underestimate of the water abundance .",
    "this might be important near bn / kl ; however , it is unlikely to be important in the more extended water emission regions where the emission is considerably weaker and , even with significant unresolved structure , it is unlikely the column density is sufficiently large for collisional de - excitation to be important .",
    "regardless of its impact on h@xmath1o this effect is unimportant for h@xmath5o and our upper limit on the water abundance based on h@xmath5o  is unaffected .",
    "however it is important to stress that the h@xmath1o  abundances that we quote are averages over the _ swas _",
    "beam , it is possible that there are significant abundance variations within the beam .",
    "_ swas _  has made the first detection of water emission from the cold , quiescent gas in the orion molecular cloud . the water emission seen by _ swas _",
    "has line widths and velocities characteristic of the emission from the molecular ridge .",
    "the average abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  in the cold gas is @xmath45 , with variations between 1 and 8@xmath4 . as discussed earlier , the abundance derived from the h@xmath1o  emission can be compromised by several physical processes , however a firm @xmath6upper limit on the relative water abundance 32 south of bn / kl of @xmath46 is established from the h@xmath5o  observation .",
    "uncertainties in the water abundance arise entirely from systematic errors associated with uncertainties in our estimates of the density and gas column density .",
    "for instance , if a significant fraction of the gas column density is associated with much lower density gas that we assumed in our model , then our estimate of the ortho - water abundance will be underestimated . specifically ,",
    "if one - half of the gas column density originated in low - density gas , our estimate of the water abundance will be too low by approximately a factor of two .",
    "since @xcite concluded that it is unlikely that the low density gas contributes significantly to the total gas column density toward the orion core , we believe that our estimates of the water abundance can not be greatly in error .",
    "@xcite estimated the water abundance in orion based on their observations of the @xmath51 transition of para - h@xmath1o  at 183 ghz . although this masing transition arises from an upper state lying 200 k above the ground state , the emission is spatially extended and , away from bn / kl , has relatively narrow line widths .",
    "@xcite estimate a relative water abundance of at least 10@xmath52 .",
    "however , if the abundance of water in the cold molecular gas were as large as they estimate , then h@xmath5o  emission should have been readily detected by _",
    "swas _  and be of comparable strength to the detected h@xmath1o  emission .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath1o  line observed by _",
    "swas_should be between 5 and 100 times stronger than observed , depending on position .",
    "the 183 ghz line must trace a warmer , denser component of the gas than the 557 ghz line - as suggested by the anomalous line velocity reported by @xcite - so that the high abundance estimate does not apply to the bulk of the cloud material , which is at low temperature .",
    "the water abundance we derive for the quiescent gas in orion is many orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for the hot gas in orion and other massive star forming regions @xcite .",
    "chemical models @xcite predict equilibrium gas - phase water abundances of order @xmath53 in the quiescent gas , similar to the results found for the extended envelope surrounding sgrb2 @xcite , but about 10 times larger than what we estimate for orion .",
    "further discussion of the chemical implications of these results is presented in @xcite .",
