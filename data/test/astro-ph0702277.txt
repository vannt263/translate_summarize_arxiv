    "our progress in understanding the large scale make - up of the universe has been propelled rapidly in the last 15 years by extremely detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "current measurements of the cmb temperature anisotropies have allowed us to place stringent constraints on some of our universe s key parameters and are proving to be a driving force in fundamental physics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic - variance places limits on the amount of information which can be extracted from the temperature anisotropies alone , however .",
    "the _ planck _  satellite , for example , is expected to reach this limit over the entire primary temperature anisotropy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the polarization of the cmb anisotropies provides us with a wealth of additional cosmological information which we have only just begun to probe .",
    "the benefits of cmb polarization data are numerous .",
    "perhaps most excitingly , polarization data provide a chance to detect primordial gravitational waves , through the measurement of b - mode polarization @xcite .",
    "the rapid improvements in cmb polarization data provided by experiments like pique @xcite , dasi @xcite , capmap @xcite , boomerang @xcite , cbi @xcite , maxipol @xcite , _ wmap _",
    "@xcite , and upcoming experiments like bicep , clover @xcite , quad , and the _ planck _  satellite , ensure that polarization will become one of the most important tools we have for furthering our understanding of the universe in the years to come .    unfortunately , the polarization signal is much more difficult to measure than the temperature anisotropies .",
    "the magnitude of the cmb polarization anisotropies is at most 10 per cent that of the temperature anisotropies , making their detection alone a challenging task .",
    "this difficulty is being gradually overcome with improvements in detector technology .",
    "another problem with the cmb polarization , however , is that its signal is dominated over most of the sky by foregrounds .",
    "in particular , over the wavelength range where the cmb is typically measured , synchrotron and non - spherical dust emission from within our galaxy contaminate uncleaned polarization maps .",
    "it is not yet clear how well the problem of foreground contamination can be solved .",
    "its resolution will require both a detailed knowledge of the structure and magnitude of the foregrounds , and an understanding of how to remove them from the polarization data without introducing unwanted systematics .",
    "understandably , the issue of polarization foregrounds has received much attention in the literature .",
    "several papers have been written on the construction of templates for the emission @xcite , and a number of methods have been proposed for performing the foreground removal @xcite . testing",
    "the efficacy of these methods is a crucial step in the analysis pipeline , to compare the abilities of the various removal techniques and ultimately to provide confidence in the accuracy of cmb polarization data .",
    "tests for the existence of residual polarized foreground contamination have received less attention in the literature , however .",
    "the test used in the _ wmap _  team s analysis , where foregrounds are cleaned using a template method in pixel space , is a simple @xmath1 statistic @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this statistic can not be used to make comparisons between different cleaning methods . the only currently proposed ` general ' statistic which is capable of this application",
    "is based on the bipolar power spectrum ( bips ) and has been developed by @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce and analyse another general method of testing for residual foreground contamination in cmb polarization maps , the @xmath0 statistic of @xcite .",
    "it possesses the virtues of having a simple interpretation as a measure of directionality in a cmb map and of being extremely rapid to compute .",
    "we argue that this statistic is well suited to the detection of foreground contamination , as both the synchrotron and dust foreground components have strong overall directionality on large scales .",
    "we then apply the @xmath0 statistic to the _ wmap _",
    "3-yr polarization maps to demonstrate its usefulness for real data .",
    "the @xmath2 statistic was first presented by @xcite ; the @xmath2 value for a sky map pixelized into @xmath3 pixels is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 runs over the unit sphere , and with the function @xmath6 given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 are weights chosen to compensate for noise and the effects of a cut sky , and @xmath9 is a local directionality vector calculated for the pixel @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath6 value is a measure of how much ( or how little ) the @xmath9 of a map tend to point in a given direction .",
    "the @xmath2 statistic tells us how extreme these values are .",
    "once @xmath2 has been calculated for real sky data , we can compare its value to that found for simulated realizations of the cmb .",
    "calculating @xmath2 for a large number of these simulations gives us a histogram of expected values , and excess directionality in a cmb data - set appears as a value of @xmath2 which is an outlier of this distribution .    for sky maps of temperature ,",
    "a reasonable quantity to use for @xmath9 is the local temperature gradient @xmath11 . for polarization maps , on the other hand ,",
    "the polarization psuedo - vectors themselves are obvious candidates .",
    "we define @xmath9 to be a vector whose magnitude and direction are those of the polarization at point @xmath10 . to express @xmath9 explicitly in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , recall that the polarization magnitude is @xmath14 while the polarization direction lies in the tangent plane to the celestial sphere at @xmath10 and makes an angle with the meridian of @xmath15 measuring the angle from the meridian is a _",
    "convention @xcite which we adopt here , although it is not universally followed .",
    "we define the vector @xmath9 to have magnitude @xmath16 and direction given by @xmath17 .",
    "because the polarization is a spin-2 quantity , it is represented by headless ` pseudo - vectors ' rather than vectors , so @xmath17 can always be rotated by @xmath18 without altering the polarization .",
    "however , due to the quadratic definition of @xmath6 , this ambiguity does not affect @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , because the function @xmath19 smoothly averages together polarization information over the whole sky , @xmath2 is only sensitive to large scale ( @xmath20 ) directionality .    the weights @xmath21 must be chosen to satisfy the null hypothesis that for isotropically distributed @xmath9 no preferred direction will be found on average , even when parts of the sky have been removed .",
    "we can see how these weights may be obtained by casting @xmath6 in matrix form as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a @xmath24 matrix defined by @xmath25    in order for no preferred direction to be found , we must have @xmath6 independent of @xmath5 ( on average ) . from equation  [ eq.fmatrixdef ]",
    "it can be seen that this constraint may be realized by choosing suitably normalized @xmath21 such that @xmath26 is equal to the identity matrix for isotropically distributed @xmath9 .",
    "this criterion ensures that @xmath6 will be approximately constant over the sky when the underlying data lack a preferred direction , although it does not guarantee that fluctuations of @xmath19 about its ensemble average will be isotropic . as a result",
    ", @xmath2 may still pick out preferred directions arising from the noise structure or sky coverage , even when the underlying signal is isotropic .",
    "we find that such departures from anisotropy are weak in practice ; this point is discussed further in section  [ section.wmappolarizationanalysis ] .    because @xmath23 is symmetric , requiring @xmath27 gives only 6 independent equations on the weights . to completely determine them for a large number of pixels",
    ", the additional constraint is imposed that @xmath28 be minimized , where @xmath29 is the expected value of @xmath30 given by pixel noise and cosmological signal . for a large signal - to - noise ratio on an isotropic sky",
    "this is equivalent to minimizing the variance of the weights . when noise is not negligible , minimizing @xmath28 rather than @xmath31 has the favourable effect of down - weighting noisy pixels .",
    "more explicit details on the calculation of the weights are given in @xcite .",
    "once the weights @xmath21 have been calculated , the simple quadratic definition of @xmath6 makes it possible to calculate @xmath2 for a given data - set in @xmath32 operations , where @xmath3 is the number of pixels .",
    "this can be done by noting that the values of @xmath5 which extremize @xmath6 are given by the eigenvectors of @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath0 follows immediately by taking the ratio of the largest and smallest eigenvalues .",
    "@xmath2 is one of the simplest statistics which can be proposed for the identification of statistical anisotropy in a cmb map . to compare it to the bips method of @xcite",
    ", we note that it is ultimately a less powerful statistic , as bips can be used to probe both large and small scales , whereas @xmath2 is only sensitive to large scale anisotropies .",
    "the advantage of @xmath0 , however , is that it can be calculated in @xmath32 operations , an unbeatable scaling .",
    "this speed makes @xmath2 an excellent statistic for ` first look ' determination of anisotropy in cmb maps , and the concomitant possible foreground contamination .",
    "the two main sources of foreground contamination in cmb polarization maps at the @xmath33ghz frequencies where the cmb is usually probed are galactic synchrotron and thermal dust emission . polarized synchrotron emission results from the acceleration of cosmic - ray electrons as they orbit in the galactic magnetic field . polarized dust emission , on the other hand , is the result of non - spherical dust grains which tend to align their long axes perpendicular to the field ; these dust grains preferentially emit thermal radiation polarized along their long axis @xcite .",
    "the polarization of both the synchrotron and thermal dust emission has its origins in the anisotropy introduced by the galactic magnetic field , and at cmb wavelengths ( where galactic faraday rotation is negligible ) these two components should both be polarized preferentially in the same direction . thus , we expect that they have a common and distinctive directionality on the sky , dictated by the large scale structure of the galactic magnetic field . to illustrate the signature of this directionality under application of the @xmath0 statistic , we analyse the low resolution k - band polarization map at @xmath34ghz and the dust polarization template of the _ wmap _  team , masking both with the standard polarization mask ( p06 ) to mimic the situation when analysing maps for foreground contamination . for the k - band map we find a preferred direction at a galactic latitude @xmath35 , within @xmath36 of the poles . for the dust emission template",
    "we find that the preferred direction lies at @xmath37 , @xmath38 shy of the poles .",
    "thus , the significant presence of synchrotron and dust foregrounds in a polarization map is expected to result in an outlying value of @xmath0 , with a preferred direction in the vicinity of the galactic poles .",
    "the release of the _ wmap _",
    "3-year data has provided us with a glimpse at the structure of cmb polarization .",
    "here we analyse the @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarization maps for foreground contamination using the @xmath2 statistic .",
    "we have chosen to examine the _ wmap _  low resolution 3rd year ( v2 ) polarization maps at healpix resolution 4 , corresponding to 3072 pixels on the entire sphere .",
    "these are the maps used for low @xmath39 analysis of the _ wmap _  data , corresponding to the angular scales which @xmath2 effectively probes . at this resolution",
    "it is also feasible to accurately simulate realizations of the _ wmap _  noise structure using the full noise covariance matrix , which becomes necessary for large angle analyses .    in all of our simulations",
    ", we generate cosmological signals given by the ` _ wmap _  + all @xmath40cdm ' fit parameters @xcite .",
    "the details of this choice have little effect on the outcome of our simulations .",
    "all of the polarization maps are strongly noise - dominated , and we find that histograms of @xmath2 for simulated data with and without cosmological signal are indistinguishable for all of the _ wmap _  bands ; this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.dhistforvpolwwocosmo ] for simulated v - band maps .",
    "thus , we believe that , with an accurate treatment of the maps noise properties , any excess directionality which we detect in the _ wmap _  data can be attributed to residual foregrounds , and not a cosmological signal .     is the value of @xmath2 calculated for the v - band data themselves . ]    for all of our simulations , we add correlated gaussian noise to each unmasked map pixel based on the _ full qu covariance matrices _ for the corresponding _ wmap _  frequency band , as provided by the _ wmap _  team .",
    "we generate this noise using the cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix .",
    "this method accounts for qq , qu and uu correlations both within each pixel and with other pixels across the sky .    for uncleaned maps , the @xmath2 statistic produces the expected results . for each band",
    ", we generate and analyze @xmath41 simulated skies .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.dhistforvpolwwocosmo ] .",
    "we can use the number of standard deviations ( at which the real data lie from the histogram mean ) as an approximate measure of the significance with which we detect foreground contamination .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.significancesforintrapixel ] , which shows the expected dependence on radiometer band as the synchrotron emission decreases with frequency and the dust contribution increases , leading to an apparent minimum of foreground contamination near the v - band .",
    "we can see that use of the standard p06 polar mask results in a greater level of contamination than when we use the more stringent p02 mask . for the p06 mask ,",
    "all of the preferred directions which are found for the real data lie within @xmath42 of the galactic poles , and for the p02 mask the preferred directions all lie within @xmath43 of the poles , further demonstrating the foreground origin of the directionality excess . with p06 masking , we find that @xmath44 of our v - band simulations have values of @xmath2 less than the value calculated for the _ wmap _  data .",
    "with p02 masking , this result drops to @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding significance figures of merit are @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .    )",
    "symbols are for the standard p06 mask ( 27 per cent sky cut ) , while the ( @xmath48 ) symbols are for the more stringent p02 masking ( 50 per cent sky cut for our downgrading scheme ) .",
    "the curve roughly follows that expected from the frequency dependence of contamination by synchrotron and dust foreground components . ]",
    "calculated for the q- and v - band data themselves . ]    in order to assess the efficacy of the foreground removal performed by the _ wmap _",
    "team we also analyse the low resolution q- and v - band foreground reduced maps .",
    "these have had dust and synchrotron templates projected out to remove foreground contamination .",
    "the results of these analyses are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.qvforeredhists ] . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath12 and @xmath49 maps have similar noise properties under analysis with @xmath2 , as the simulation histograms almost completely overlap .",
    "we find no evidence for residual foreground contamination in these maps , their @xmath2 statistics both lying well within the range of probable values , and with the maximal @xmath2 directions for the q- and v - band data being @xmath50 and @xmath51 from the pole , respectively .",
    "our significance figure of merit is @xmath52 for the q - band and @xmath53 for the v - band maps .",
    "@xmath54 of the simulated @xmath2 values lie below the map value for the q - band , and @xmath55 of the simulated data lie below the v - band value .",
    "thus , we find no evidence for foreground contamination in these cleaned maps .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we had generated noise which only accounted for the intra - pixel or diagonal components of the noise covariance matrix then we would have found strong evidence for residual contamination . in the case of the v - band foreground",
    "reduced data , for example , we would have found some evidence for foreground contamination , with over @xmath44 of simulated @xmath2 values falling below that calculated for real data in the cleaned v - band maps ( corresponding to a value of @xmath46 for our significance figure ) .",
    "accounting for _ inter_-pixel noise correlations broadens the distribution of simulated @xmath2 values .",
    "indeed , the detailed noise structure of the _ wmap _  data appears to be such that it introduces a degree of anisotropy into the maps .",
    "this can best be seen by looking at the histograms of preferred directions found in a series of 30,000 v - band map simulations , given in fig .",
    "[ fig.diagintrafullcovhists ] .",
    "differing methods of noise generation were utilized for three sets of simulations .",
    "` diagonal ' noise was generated from only the @xmath56 and @xmath57 elements of the covariance matrix , intra - pixel noise included @xmath58 terms , and the full covariance matrix treatment simulated inter - pixel correlations as well .",
    "unlike the isotropic distribution of preferred directions which is found when accounting only for diagonal noise correlations , there is a tendency towards anisotropy for the intra - pixel and full covariance simulations , with a definite slight preference for directions in the vicinity of @xmath59 for the full covariance simulations .",
    "the statistics of these two dimensional histograms support this visual finding , with the diagonal , intrapixel , and full covariance simulation methods having variance / mean values of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "for an isotropic sky , we expect the histogram values to follow a multinomial distribution , and to have a variance / mean of @xmath63 .",
    "we believe that the excess variance which is seen in the diagonal and intra - pixel simulation histograms can be attributed to the slight inherent bias possessed by @xmath2 , as discussed in section  [ section.thedstatistic ] .",
    "the much higher excess variance seen in the inter - pixel simulations can be attributed to the sum of this bias and another , stronger bias given by the noise covariance structure of the map .",
    "this bias is independent of the specifics of the @xmath2 statistic , and most likely can be detected in the future by other polarization statistics sensitive to anisotropy .",
    "the dependence of our results on the precise treatment of noise underscores the general need for care when dealing with large angle polarization data .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath2 statistic of @xcite in the context of cmb polarization data , finding that it is an excellent general tool for quickly assessing the magnitude of foreground contamination in polarization maps . under analysis with @xmath2 , imperfectly removed foregrounds leave a tell - tale signature of excess directionality toward the galactic poles .",
    "an analysis of the _ wmap _  3-year polarization data supports these statements .",
    "we find the expected dependence of foreground contamination on channel frequency in all of the _ wmap _  low resolution maps , with the magnitude of this excess disappearing in the cleaned , ` foreground reduced ' maps .    in the future ,",
    "a better understanding of the polarization foregrounds will allow us to develop more sophisticated statistics to precisely evaluate the possibility of foreground contamination in cleaned maps .",
    "given the current state of understanding , however , we feel that calculation of @xmath2 is a useful technique for this purpose , as it is one of the simplest possible statistics which captures the directional signature of the polarization foregrounds .",
    "it has the advantages of being simple and rapidly computable , and can be considered complementary to other statistics such as the bips @xcite .",
    "hence it should be one of the diagnostic tests ready to assess foreground contamination in data from the _ planck _  satellite , as well as other large - angle polarization experiments .",
    "the work carried out in this paper made use of the healpix @xcite package for pixelization .",
    "this research was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and the canadian space agency .",
