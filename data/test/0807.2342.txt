    "the dissipative two - state or _ spin - boson _ model has been thoroughly studied in wide regions of the parameter space with diverse methods and techniques since the 80 s @xcite .    in the last decade , the subject of decoherence has experienced renaissance following the growing interest in the field of quantum state manipulation and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "any noise source sensitively leads to a narrowing of the quantum coherence domain .",
    "this entails severe limitations for coupled qubits to perform logic quantum operations . for this reason ,",
    "extensive understanding of the decoherence mechanisms is indispensable .    in this work ,",
    "we focus upon a model which is a generalization of the single spin - boson model to the case of two spins which mutually interact via an ising - type coupling and are coupled to independent environments made up by bosons .",
    "the first analysis of this model relying on the influence functional method was given by dub and stamp @xcite .",
    "they obtained results for the dynamics in analytic form in restricted regions of the parameter space by omitting certain classes of path contributions and bath correlations .",
    "several other previous studies on the same or related models relied on the master equation and/or perturbative redfield approach @xcite .",
    "besides the weak - coupling assumption , often the secular approximation @xcite is made , which breaks down however when the spectrum becomes degenerate .",
    "the model allows , for instance , to study decoherence and relaxation of two coupled qubits @xcite , or the influence of a bistable impurity on the qubit dynamics @xcite . the latter may significantly degrade coherence in josephson phase qubits @xcite",
    "other possible application is study of coherence effects in coupled molecular magnets @xcite .    in earlier works ,",
    "the model has been analyzed in the pure dephasing regime both by the feynman - vernon method @xcite and the lindblad approach @xcite .",

    "the model and relevant quantities of the reduced dynamics are introduced in section 2 .",
    "section 3 deals with the exact formal solution for the reduced dynamics . in section 4 , the path sum is carried out in the white - noise domain without any further approximation , and analytic expressions for the relevant expectation values in laplace space are presented . after an overview of the qualitative features of the dynamics in section 5 , we present in section 6 explicit expressions for decoherence and relaxation in the various parameter regimes ranging from low temperture and/or weak coupling to high temperature and/or strong coupling .",
    "finally , we study in section 7 the influence of a nonlinear spin - boson environment on the second spin in the various limits .",
