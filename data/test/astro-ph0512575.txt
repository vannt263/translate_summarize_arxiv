    "according to the most popular progenitor model of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the collapsar model @xcite , a grb is the result of ultra - relativistic jets ejected by an accreting black hole formed by the core - collapse of a massive star ( most probably a wolf - rayet star ) .",
    "this predicts a physical link between grbs and supernovae ( sne ) that has been spectroscopically confirmed in four cases so far : xrf 020903 @xcite , grb 021211/sn2002lt @xcite , grb 030329/sn2003dh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and grb 031203/sn2003lw .",
    "further evidence comes from the observation of late - time bumps in grb afterglows that can be modelled very well by an underlying sn component @xcite , and which have led to the conclusion that in fact all long - duration grbs are physically related to sn explosions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "furthermore , the collapsar model implies that the progenitors of long - duration grbs are associated with regions of high - mass star formation @xcite , which might reveal themselves by a detectable extinction in the grb host galaxies along the lines of sight towards the burster .",
    "this idea is further supported by the so - called dark bursts @xcite , for which no optical afterglow has been discovered despite rapid and deep searches in small error box regions . while most none - discoveries are the result of too shallow searches and too large error boxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a small percentile remains that require intrinsic extinction to dim the afterglow , e.g. , grb 970828 @xcite , 990506 @xcite and 020819 @xcite , while others might have been intrinsically underluminous ( for a discussion , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ".    of particular interest within the dust extinction model is the statistical distribution of the amount of visual extinction in the grb host galaxies , as well as the nature of the corresponding dust .",
    "given the fact that grbs and their afterglows can be observed up to high redshift , they offer the possibility to get insight into the nature of cosmic dust when the universe was much younger and galaxies were much less evolved . furthermore , since the optical properties of the dust grains trace the environmental conditions in the interstellar medium @xcite , they are to some degree an indicator for the physical conditions to make a grb progenitor .    the present paper is the third in a series of papers where we employ a large database of photometry gathered from the literature to reanalyze all optical afterglow light curves of grbs in the pre-_swift _ era in a consistent manner to derive a homogenous sample , which is then used to study afterglow properties in a statistical way . in paper",
    "i and an update @xcite , the properties of the supernovae underlying nearby afterglow light curves were explored . in paper",
    "ii @xcite the optical light curve parameters were derived for a large ( and basically complete ) sample of afterglows observed by the end of 2004 , up to the launch of the _ swift _ mission . in this paper , we extend this systematic analysis to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of grb afterglows in the optical / near - infrared bands in order to search for signals from extinction by dust in the grb host galaxies .    in  [ data ]",
    ", we present the methods with which we analyzed the afterglow seds . among the 59 grbs studied in paper",
    "ii , 30 had data quality sufficiently high to be included in a sample for an investigation of the seds .",
    "we then further reduce this sample to a golden sample of 19 grb afterglows with parameters derived from specific dust model fits . in ",
    "[ rad ] we present the results derived from our analysis and discuss our findings in the context of the standard fireball model .",
    "the fitting process allows us to derive the host galaxy extinction @xmath0 along the line of sight and the intrinsic , extinction - corrected spectral slope @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) of the afterglow light in the optical / near - infrared bands .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 sample is then further analyzed statistically to derive conclusions about the environment of grbs and the dust properties of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in paper ii we presented the analysis of a complete list of optical / nir afterglow light curves for which sufficient public data was available , up to grb 041006 .",
    "one parameter derived in these light curve fits is the normalization constant @xmath3 , the magnitude of the afterglow at a certain time , being one day after the grb trigger in the case of a light curve fit with a simple power - law ( @xmath4 ) , or the jet break time , @xmath5 , in case of a fit with a smoothly broken power - law with a pre - break decay slope @xmath6 and a post - break decay slope @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "all data used to fit these light curves is corrected for galactic extinction with @xmath8 derived from the cobe maps @xcite employing the milky way extinction curve of @xcite . the contemporaneous afterglow brightness in different photometric bands is then transformed into a spectral energy distribution , using zero fluxes and median wavelengths taken from the literature .",
    "the sed for grb 030329 is derived in an alternate way , see appendix [ litcomp ] .",
    "the fits use a levenberg - marquardt @xmath9 minimization algorithm . unless stated otherwise , all errors in this paper are at the @xmath10 confidence level .",
    "initially , we assume no extinction and the seds are fit with a simple power - law , @xmath2 . in the following ,",
    "we label a slope derived from such a fit @xmath11 .",
    "a steep @xmath11 combined with a non - linear ( curved ) @xmath12 is then indicative of extinction in the grb host galaxy .    in order to derive the visual extinction @xmath0 in the grb host galaxy along the line of sight",
    ", we transform the wavelengths of the sed into the host galaxy frame following @xcite , using redshifts taken from the compilation of @xcite . in two cases redshift estimates",
    "are used . for grb 980519",
    ", we use a redshift of @xmath13 , following @xcite who state that @xmath14 due to the lack of a supernova bump . for xrf 030723",
    ", we varied the redshift and fit the sed for each redshift , and find the best results in a redshift range of @xmath15 to 0.4 .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite find tentative evidence for a low redshift ( although the host galaxy would be very faint ) , and @xcite find a preferred @xmath17 from the amati relation @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the sed is fit well by a power - law with an additional small amount of source frame extinction .",
    "the influence of intergalactic lyman absorption on the photometry was accounted for by excluding sed data points lying beyond @xmath18 hz in the host frame from the fit ) , the v band also had to be excluded as the host galaxy is a dla with a very wide lyman @xmath19 absorption line @xcite . ] .",
    "the observed sed ( corrected for galactic extinction ) is then modeled by the function @xmath20 with @xmath21 here , @xmath1 is the intrinsic power - law slope of the sed , and @xmath22 a normalization constant ( we choose the unextinguished flux density at @xmath23 hz in the host galaxy frame ) .",
    "the function @xmath24 is the extinction law assumed for the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the grb host galaxy .",
    "we call this extinction source frame extinction .",
    "it encompasses local extinction close to the site of the grb and host galaxy extinction further away in case the afterglow passes through a significant part of the host galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "the extinction law for the milky way ( mw ) , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) was taken from @xcite .",
    "these three dust types differ strongly in the wavelength region we examine ( host frame uv / optical / nir ) , especially toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "the sequence mw , lmc , smc is given by a decreasing strength of the 2175  bump , an increasing fuv extinction , and a decreasing reddening per h atom @xcite .",
    "the former implies the absence of very small carbonaceous grains @xcite , while the latter is consistent with the trend observed for the metallicity in hii regions , with mw representing the highest metallicity and smc the lowest .",
    "thus , smc dust traces the dust properties in low - metallicity environments .",
    "as the wavelengths of the sed are shifted from the uv into the optical / nir , a distinction between the three dust types is easiest for grbs at high redshift , whereas for nearby grbs the three extinction curves are almost identical in the considered wavelength regime .",
    "since the fit has three free parameters ( @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) , the observed sed has to have at least four data points .",
    "the one exception is grb 000131 ( appendix [ litcomp ] ) , which we include because of its very high redshift ( @xmath25 , * ? ? ?",
    "the fitting process is very sensitive to slight variations in the sed , especially if the @xmath3 data points have small errors , so we did a careful check for each sed and removed outliers .",
    "furthermore , we added a systematic error of 0.03 magnitudes to each data point of the sed ( with the exception of those small number of cases where @xmath3 is based on only one data point , as these almost always have much larger errors anyway ) to encompass uncertainties that may derive from the process of data reduction .",
    "this results in a strong decrease of @xmath9 for the fits and reduces the importance of this measure for discerning among different models for sed fits .",
    "our final sample ( table [ taball ] ) comprises 30 afterglows out of the 59 bursts included in the sample of paper ii , with fits to the three dust models for each afterglow .",
    "figure [ seds ] shows all 30 seds and the associated best fits for each of the three dust models .",
    "this figure contains all fit results that we obtain , including those with unphysical results , just in order to show the failure of certain extinction laws to reproduce the observational data .",
    "table [ taball ] reveals that many of the fits are unsatisfactory .",
    "first of all , some fits have very large error bars @xmath26 and @xmath27 . since the seds are fit by allowing all three free parameters ( incl .",
    "@xmath22 ) to vary simultaneously , this creates a cross - sectional error , as the errors of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are correlated . the steepest spectral slope ( @xmath28 ) results in the smallest extinction ( @xmath29 ) and vice",
    "secondly , many fits , especially when using the mw dust model , find _ negative _ extinction .",
    "this would imply bright emission features , for which we have no evidence .",
    "thirdly in some cases @xmath30 is found , while the standard fireball model implies @xmath31 in the timespans ( hours to days ) and wavelength bands that afterglows are typically observed in , and thus the timespan where we derive @xmath3 .",
    "these afterglow seds ( e.g. grb 971214 ) are categorized by a relatively shallow unextinguished slope @xmath32 to 1 but a strong spectral curvature .",
    "correction of this curvature results in @xmath30 .",
    "one solution would be dust with an increased fuv extinction , but recent results on high redshift quasars @xcite do not support this idea .",
    "we note that in these cases the data base is also sparse in photometric bands other than @xmath33 .    to derive a more homogenous sample , which we call the golden sample , we employ the following criteria :    1",
    ".   the 1@xmath34 error in @xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) and the 1@xmath34 error in @xmath0 ( @xmath26 ) should both be @xmath35 .",
    "2 .   @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   we do not consider grbs where all fits ( mw , lmc , and smc ) find @xmath37 , even if the previous criterium is fulfilled .",
    "4 .   @xmath38 ( although we do not reject cases with @xmath39 ) .",
    "5 .   a known redshift .    as there is no case where lmc dust is clearly preferred compared to smc and mw dust ( table [ taball ] ) , in the following we",
    "remove all lmc dust cases from further consideration .",
    "after applying these criteria , for the remaining 19 grbs , in eight cases only one dust model remains . for grb 000131",
    "no distinction can be made , as it is not fit with extinction .",
    "the remaining ten grbs give ambiguous results when it comes to distinguishing between the two dust models . with the exception of grb 020813 and grb 030328 , where visual inspection of the fits shows that the inclusion of smc dust reproduces the observed sed better than mw dust , no true distinction can be made at all .",
    "for these grbs , we do not claim any dust model preference , but for the sake of consistency , we choose the dust model result which produces smaller errors in the derived parameters .",
    "this results in 19 @xmath1-@xmath0 pairs which we designate our golden sample ( table [ tabgold ] ) .",
    "there are some grbs for which high visual source frame extinction has been deduced in the literature but which are not included in table [ taball ] . for grb 980329 ,",
    "no redshift is known , although it is assumed to be high . @xcite",
    "derive a bayesian photometric redshift of @xmath40 . the very steep observed spectral slope ( uncorrected for extinction )",
    "has been noted by several authors .",
    "@xcite use their own data combined with data from the literature and derive an @xmath41 for @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this is concurrent with our result @xmath44 for smc dust and under the assumption of a redshift of @xmath40 .",
    "however , this result also has @xmath30 , implying that the true host extinction is lower than @xmath45 .",
    "two afterglows which have redshifts but viable data in only two colors , grb 990705 and grb 000418 , could not be fitted with the procedure outlined in ",
    "[ analysis ] .",
    "@xcite find @xmath46 , in agreement with our result .",
    "while they do discuss reddening by intrinsic dust , their lack of a redshift measurement does not allow them to find a definite result .",
    "the steep initial decay suggests a wind environment with a cooling break blueward of the optical bands . using this case and smc dust",
    ", we derive @xmath47 . for grb 000418 , assuming a wind ( ism ) environment with the cooling break blueward of the optical bands and the new derived light curve parameters from paper ii we fix @xmath1 via the @xmath19-@xmath1 relations and find @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the latter is slightly smaller than in @xcite ( who used an ism environment ) , while @xcite find @xmath50 for lmc dust . finally , there are indications of very high source frame extinction from the nir afterglows of grb 030528 @xcite and grb 040827 @xcite , but we were not able to perform any fits .",
    "in the selection of our golden sample , there were eight bursts where application of our selection criteria yielded an unambiguous result .",
    "smc dust is by far the most preferred model , with seven out of the eight cases ( table [ tabgold ] ) , only grb 970508 has evidence for mw dust .",
    "this result is expected from studies of grb host galaxies , which indicate that most hosts are low - metallicity galaxies , as they are lyman @xmath19 emitters , blue , and subluminous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus we deduce that the ism in these galaxies is probably metal - poor .    while the preference of smc - like dust in grb environments",
    "has already been found by many groups for several bursts , e.g. , grb 000301c @xcite , grb 000926 @xcite , grb 010222 @xcite , grb 020813 @xcite , grb 021004 @xcite , grb 030226 @xcite , grb 030429 @xcite , xrf 030723 @xcite , our study puts this conclusion on a statistical basis .",
    "given the sparse knowledge we have so far on the dust properties in cosmologically remote galaxies we note however that this finding does not necessarily imply the requirement of low - metallicity environments for the creation of grb progenitors , as it might be indicated by smc - like dust .",
    "the fact that at least some afterglows seds are fitted best assuming mw dust raises doubt on such a general requirement . even though one can not rule out the possibility that in such cases the line of sight passes through foreground material with different grain properties and ism metallicity . in any case",
    ", it is clear from this study that grb afterglows can be used as a tool in order to explore the properties of cosmic dust in the cosmologically remote universe , in star - forming regions in particular and in galaxies in general .",
    "but high quality photometric data are essential for building larger samples .      among the 19 grbs in our golden sample ( table [ tabgold ] ) , we find eleven with @xmath51 .",
    "we note that almost all of these cases are also those with the highest quality data .",
    "basically , this is not surprising , as more sed data reduces errors .",
    "it is more speculative to state that , given high quality sed data , there will always be small amounts of source frame extinction detected in grb afterglows . in eight of these cases ,",
    "the detection is significant at the 2@xmath34 level or higher , it is significant at more than 3@xmath34 in two cases and at 4@xmath34 in one case .",
    "the distribution of derived intrinsic extinctions is given in figure [ a_vhist ] .",
    "a strong clustering toward low extinctions ( @xmath52 ) is evident . zooming in with smaller bins",
    "shows that values between @xmath53 and @xmath54 are preferred , with a non - error - weighted mean value of @xmath55 .",
    "no afterglow is extinguished by more than 0.8 magnitudes . as a comparison , the prime example of a dark burst",
    "is plotted , grb 970828 . for this burst , @xcite derive @xmath56 by interpolating between x - ray and radio data and comparing this with deep optical observations that found no afterglow @xcite .",
    "the intervening space is free of examples , creating a potential dark burst desert . on the other hand , there are two afterglows in table [ taball ] that have mean @xmath0 values lying in this dark burst desert but are not included in the golden sample due to the large errors of their fits ( criterium ( 1 ) in   [ golden ] ) . for grb 010921 , mw dust is preferred , as smc dust finds @xmath57 .",
    "we derive @xmath58 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "while this is a positive detection , the error encompasses most other bursts of the golden sample . for grb 980703",
    ", no dust model preference can be derived , but even for the smc result with smaller extinction , we find @xmath59 .",
    "how real is the non - existence of highly extinguished afterglows ?",
    "a first argument against the reality of the dark burst desert is that our sample is biased toward afterglows with low source frame extinction , as we require viable photometric data in several wavebands and a known redshift .",
    "intrinsic extinction complicates the gathering of photometry ( starting with the discovery of the afterglow ) and a spectroscopic redshift . in  [ others ] , we mentioned several probably highly extinguished afterglows that are not part of our sample due to the sparsity of their photometric data .",
    "highly extinguished afterglows are not observed well enough to determine conclusively that they are highly extinguished and not just intrinsically faint @xcite .",
    "figure [ a_vtoz ] shows the derived visual extinctions ( table [ tabgold ] ) plotted as a function of redshift @xmath60 ( values taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the exception of grb 030429",
    "the amount of extinction drops sharply toward high redshifts .",
    "most likely , this can be explained by an observational bias , at least in the pre-_swift _ era where only very few afterglows were already localized within minutes after a burst . in particular , due to the wavelength dependence of the dust opacity , the higher the redshift the more effective dust can dim an afterglow in the optical bands .",
    "furthermore , the redshift measurement itself is biased toward bright and unextinguished afterglows , as many redshifts are determined from absorption spectra taken when the afterglow is much brighter than the underlying host galaxy .",
    "finally , our data indicate that , on average , low-@xmath60 grbs have brighter afterglows ( cf .",
    "figure [ bigpic1 ] ) , and thus have a greater chance of being detected through significant extinction .",
    "unfortunately , the chances of detecting a `` rosetta stone dark burst '' at low redshift that is highly obscured by dust but still bright enough to yield viable data and a redshift might be small if the grb frequency is coupled with the star - formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and low metallicities @xcite .",
    "it is also visible that the the ability to discern between different dust models is coupled to the redshift , as the strongest deviations ( 2175  bump , fuv extinction ) appear in the uv region and the burst has to lie at a certain redshift to shift these features into the optical bands .",
    "assuming that our database is not seriously affected by an observational bias ( dark bursts ) , figure [ submm ] shows that the standard grb afterglow is nearly unextinguished in its host galaxy .",
    "since any long - lasting dust destruction by the intense fireball radiation should represent itself in a color evolution of the afterglow @xcite , which we do not find in our data , we conclude that on average there is not much evidence for dust in grb environments along the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , any dust destruction could only affect the dust in the immediate grb environment , say , within 10 pc around the burster @xcite .",
    "dust at larger distances will still produce extinction . additionally , the _ swift _ satellite has made observations of early grb afterglows routine , and a major result is the almost complete absence of reverse shock uv flashes @xcite .",
    "it seems that in most cases the absence of large amounts of dust is not due to dust destruction but due to the fact that the standard grb progenitor ( seen pole - on along its rotational axis ) is not enshrouded by dust , globally and locally .",
    "thus , if in those cases where significant extinction is found the extinction is not just produced in the immediate grb environment ( local extinction ) but prevails within the host galaxy ( global extinction ) , we would expect that grbs for which we find significant optical extinction are located in very dusty , submm - bright hosts .    in order to explore this possibility ,",
    "we have taken from the literature all submm data for grb hosts with a flux density @xmath61 at the 1@xmath34 level that are also in our main sample of 30 afterglows @xcite and calculated the corresponding star formation rate ( sfr ) via the procedure developed by @xcite ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to take the different redshifts into account .",
    "since the sfr is a direct measure of the far - infrared luminosity of a galaxy @xcite , it traces its total amount of radiating dust . for grb 980703",
    ", we conservatively used the result for smc dust , which has the lowest extinction , and took the sfr from @xcite .",
    "we added grb 000418 ( @xmath48 ,  [ others ] ) , arbitrarily assuming a 1  @xmath34 error of 0.5 mag , and transformed the @xmath0 result for grb 011211 ( smc dust ) into an upper limit , as we find @xmath30 , making @xmath0 unsure .",
    "the resulting relation of sfr ( @xmath62 per year ) versus @xmath0 is shown in figure [ submm ] .",
    "a trend is visible , a rising sfr is coupled to a rising intrinsic visual extinction along the line of sight , with the exception of grb 010222 .",
    "a linear fit to the data ( excepting grb 010222 relation is grb 010222 . a hubble space telescope image of the grb 010222 host galaxy reveals the location of the grb being offset by a small margin from the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we find a low extinction value along the line of sight , whereas persistent submillimeter flux indicates that this is a dusty starburst galaxy @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is resolved if the grb happened toward the edge of the galaxy , but our line of sight places it in front of the galaxy . ] ) gives @xmath63 .",
    "we conclude that , on average , grb afterglows that show significant extinction along the line of sight in their host are located in galaxies with a substantial star formation rate and , hence , a globally acting extinction by large amounts of dust .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the trend seen in the data indicates that the line - of - sight can pass through a significant extent of the host galaxy .",
    "since the sample is still very small and the error bars on both the sfr and the extinction @xmath0 are very large , it is clear that more and better data are required in order to verify this result .",
    "figure [ betahist ] displays the distribution of the intrinsic spectral slopes , @xmath1 , for the bursts from table [ tabgold ] .",
    "the distribution is broad , ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 , and features a peak around @xmath64 .",
    "we find a non - error - weighted mean value of @xmath65 .",
    "this result of a broad @xmath1 distribution of the intrinsic sed of the afterglows is probably robust , since ( 1 ) our light curve fits of the individual afterglows usually include many data points covering several days , so that we are not much sensitive to individual measurement errors and ( 2 ) these fits do not include the very early phase of an afterglow when its spectral properties might develop much faster than at later times .",
    "in fact , with the exception of the early afterglows of grb 021004 and grb 030329 , we have never found clear evidence for color variations of the genuine afterglow light in our data .    while it is not the goal of the present paper to find reliable explanations for the observed width of the distribution of spectral slopes @xmath1 of the afterglows in the optical / nir bands , we note that the mean of this distribution gives a value for the power - law index of the electron distribution ( @xmath66 ) of @xmath67 , assuming a wind environment and the cooling frequency blueward of the optical bands ( * ? ? ? * and references therin ) and the peak of the histogram ( figure [ betahist ] ) .",
    "this is in general agreement with theoretical predictions for ultra - relativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "the maximum values we find for @xmath1 ( figure [ betahist ] ) could then be explained by those afterglows which had the cooling frequency redward of the optical bands during the entire time span when they were observed , provided that @xmath68 is a universal number . on the other hand",
    ", a universality of @xmath68 seems to be difficult to reconcile with those afterglows which have @xmath69 . assuming the standard afterglow models @xcite , these afterglows require @xmath70 , provided that the basic model assumptions are indeed fulfilled in these cases . note that in paper ii we also found afterglows that require",
