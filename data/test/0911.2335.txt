    "while so far the majority of experiments is carried out with ground state atoms , exploiting the unique properties of highly excited states is gradually moving into the focus of experimental and theoretical efforts .",
    "atoms in highly excited states can interact strongly , i.e. , the interaction strength can be of the order of several tens of mhz at a distance of several micrometers .",
    "the corresponding quantum dynamics takes place on a microsecond timescale and thus is orders of magnitude faster than the atoms external dynamics . such scenario",
    "is usually referred to as frozen gas @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental groups have studied the excitation dynamics of such system using rydberg states of alkali metal atoms @xcite which were excited from an ultracold gas . here a dramatic reduction of the fraction of excited atoms was observed once the atomic density was too high or the interaction between excited states was too strong @xcite .",
    "this is a manifestation of the so - called rydberg blockade @xcite effect that is responsible for the collective character @xcite of rydberg excitations in dense gases .",
    "very recently the power of rydberg states to establish a controlled interaction of single atoms trapped in distant traps has been demonstrated in a series of impressive experiments @xcite . strongly supported by these results ,",
    "highly excited atoms nowadays are believed to have a manifold of applications ranging far beyond traditional atomic physics . indeed , exploiting the properties of atoms in rydberg states",

    "@xcite ) we showed that the unique properties of rydberg atoms allow the creation of entangled many - particle states on a one - dimensional ring lattice on a short time scale .",
    "finding simple ways for creating entangled many - particle states is of importance , since such states have a number of applications , e.g , they serve as resource for the creation of single - photon light sources @xcite , for improving precision quantum measurements @xcite and for measurement based quantum information processing .    in this paper",

    "the wannier functions @xmath1 are localized at the @xmath2-th site with a width @xmath3 . we assume the external dynamics of the atoms to be frozen , i.e. , no hopping and hence no particle exchange between the lattice sites is present .",
    "this is well justified as the internal ( electronic ) dynamics - in which we are interested here - takes place on a much shorter timescale , of the order of hundred nanoseconds .",

    "this is achieved , for example , if the system is initialized in a mott - insulator state .",
    "the interaction between the rydberg atoms is given by the van - der - waals potential @xmath21 , that is quickly decaying with the distance @xmath22 between atoms .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath23 scales with the eleventh power of the principal quantum number @xmath6 , the interaction can strongly affect the excitation dynamics of atoms that are separated by several micrometers .",

    "the rabi frequency @xmath19 and the combination of @xmath43 can be effectively interpreted as perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "hence , the relevant parameters in our system will be : a ) the ones related to the laser , i.e. , the single - atom rabi frequency @xmath7 and detuning @xmath8 , which can be time - dependent and b ) the interaction between rydberg atoms represented by @xmath44 .      throughout this paper ,",
    "we consider the regime where the detuning is much smaller than both the collective rabi frequency ( laser driving ) and the interaction strength , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "as a consequence , the behavior of the system will be determined by the ratio of the latter two parameters . here",
    "we focus on the limit @xmath46 , i.e. , the laser coupling is much stronger than the interaction between atoms . in this regime the first term of",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) is the dominant one and it is convenient to make it diagonal by means of a rotation of the basis .",
    "this is achieved by the unitary transformation @xmath47 which brings @xmath48 and @xmath49 . when applied to our hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) ,",

    "let us now analyze the importance of the individual contributions of @xmath54 . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , the spectrum of @xmath54 decays into manifolds of states which are separated by gaps whose width is approximately @xmath55 .",
    "this is caused by the dominant first term of @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath57 are - in terms of the ( super)atom states - given by @xmath58\\ ] ] with @xmath59 .",
    "thus , each of the manifolds that determine the coarse structure of the spectrum is spanned by a set of product states that have the same number of ( super)atoms in the state @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , these manifolds are denoted by @xmath61 , which is the eigenvalue of the states with respect to the operator @xmath62 .",
    "the second term of @xmath52 conserves the total number of @xmath60 ( super)atoms . in other words , it couples only states that belong to the same @xmath61-manifold and that are nearly degenerate . as a consequence ,",
    "the strength of these intra - manifold couplings due to @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "conversely , @xmath64 and @xmath65 couple states that belong to manifolds with different number of ( super)atoms in the state @xmath60 . in particular , @xmath64 and the last term of @xmath65 flip one of the ( super)atoms from @xmath60 to @xmath66 or viceversa .",
    "thus , the coupled states belong to different manifolds with @xmath67 , energetically separated by @xmath55 .",
    "the two first terms of @xmath65 drive a similar process , flipping always two contiguous ( super)atoms in the same state simultaneously , i.e. , @xmath68 or @xmath69 . as a result",
    ", these terms connect states with eigenvalue @xmath61 to those with @xmath70 , which are separated roughly by @xmath71 .",
    "these features are reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .     and @xmath72 .",
    "the spectrum splits into manifolds which can be labeled by the quantum number @xmath61 of the operator @xmath73 . for sufficiently large @xmath19",
    ", the coupling between manifolds that is established only by @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be neglected .",
    "the ( constrained ) dynamics inside the @xmath61-subspaces is then determined by @xmath52.,width=188 ]    the transition rates between @xmath61-manifolds corresponding to @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be estimated by second order perturbation theory to be of the order @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "hence , for sufficiently strong driving @xmath46 , their contribution can be neglected and the system s dynamics is constrained to the @xmath61-manifolds . as a consequence ,",
    "the hamiltonian that drives the intra - manifold dynamics , @xmath52 , _ effectively drives the dynamics of the entire system in this parameter regime_. this hamiltonian is analytically solvable , and we thus have access to the actual spectrum and eigenstates of the system .",
    "the diagonalization of this hamiltonian relies on the so - called jordan - wigner transformation and a fourier transform that we explain thoroughly in the following paragraph @xcite .",
    "the pauli matrices in the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_xy ] ) obey anti - commutation and commutation relations when they belong to the same and different sites , respectively .",
    "thus , the algebra is neither bosonic nor fermionic .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by the jordan - wigner transformation , @xmath76 which introduces the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 that obey the canonical fermionic algebra @xmath79 after this transformation , the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_xy ] ) takes on the form @xmath80\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\left(c_l^\\dagger c_1+c_1^\\dagger c_l\\right)\\left(e^{i\\pi n_+}+1\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the hamiltonian has been transformed into one which describes a chain of spinless fermions with nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the last term of hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_jw ] ) appears due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it depends on the operator @xmath81 which counts the total number of fermions , which is also equivalent to the number of ( super)atoms in the state @xmath60 .",
    "thus , depending on the parity of the number of fermions of the state , @xmath52 reads @xmath82 for even ( e ) or odd ( o ) parity , respectively .",
    "these two cases can be accounted for simultaneously in a convenient way by introducing a matrix representation for the fermionic operators .",
    "they are projected onto the subspaces with even and odd eigenvalue of @xmath83 by means of the projectors @xmath84/2 $ ] , with @xmath85 .",
    "since the hamiltonian @xmath52 conserves the number of fermions , i.e. , @xmath86=0 $ ] , it is diagonal in this representation and can be decomposed as @xmath87 we now introduce new matrix - valued creation and annihilation operators of the form @xmath88 which obey the fermionic algebra provided @xmath78 and @xmath89 are fermionic operators .",
    "the hamiltonian can now be conveniently written as @xmath90 with @xmath91    the diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_matrix_gamma ] ) is achieved by performing the following fourier transform @xmath92 with the fourier coefficients @xmath93 the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 are matrix - valued @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 being fermionic creation and annihilation operators , respectively . defining the eigenvalue matrix @xmath99 as @xmath100 } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\cos{\\left[\\frac{2\\pi}{l}n\\right ] } \\end{array}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the diagonalized hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_matrix_gamma ] ) reads @xmath101 as we will see in the next section , the introduction of the matrix - valued fermionic operators has the advantage that excited states can be constructed by applying products of @xmath94 to the ground state . as a consequence ,",
    "this matrix notation allows us to automatically distinguish between the odd and even fermion cases , which otherwise has to be done manually .",
    "the symmetry properties of our system impose certain selection rules for the excitation of the many - particle states . in order to understand this ,",
    "let us start our analysis of the excited states by studying the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "because of the special arrangement of the sites , the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) and also ( [ eqn : h_matrix_lambda ] ) are invariant under cyclic shifts and reversal of the lattice sites .",
    "this can be formally seen by representing these two symmetries through the operators @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "their action on the spin ladder operators are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , from where follows that @xmath106=\\left[h_\\mathrm{spin},{\\cal r}\\right]=0 $ ] , i.e. , both of them correspond to conserved quantities .",
    "thus , if the system is initialized in an eigenstate with respect to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the time evolution will not take place in the entire hilbert space , but merely in the subspace spanned by the states with the same quantum number with respect to @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this observation is highly relevant for our system . in practise",
    ", the natural initial situation will be that in which all atoms are in the ground state , i.e. , @xmath109 .",
    "this state has the above - mentioned properties , i.e. , it is invariant under cyclic shifts and the reversal of the sites : @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we will refer to such a state that has eigenvalue @xmath112 with respect to @xmath107 and @xmath108 as being fully - symmetric .",
    "hence , only the states from this fully - symmetric subspace can be actually accessed in the course of the system s time evolution under hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) . in the following",
    "we will thus focus on constructing excited states that belong to this subset .",
    "the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_matrix_lambda ] ) is given by @xmath113 and it is fully - symmetric .",
    "excited states that contain @xmath114 fermions are in general formed by successive application of the creation operator , i.e. , @xmath115 . however , not all combinations will give rise to states that belong to the fully - symmetric subset .",

    "for a fully - symmetric state we require @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 with @xmath118 being a placeholder for @xmath102 and @xmath103 . after some algebra one finds that @xmath119 since @xmath120 and @xmath121 , only the single excitation with @xmath122 is symmetric under cyclic shifts and reversal .",

    "to do so , we first turn off the laser ( @xmath201 ) and then switch on a second one whose action can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath202 in this expression , @xmath203 and @xmath204 stand for the creation and annihilation operators of an single - atom stable storage state @xmath205 on site @xmath2 , respectively . in the limit where the interaction is much smaller than the rabi frequency of this transition , i.e. , @xmath206",

    "this is accomplished in two steps : first , one has to prepare the ground state @xmath157 of hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_xy ] ) in the limit @xmath46 ; once the ground state is populated , the single - fermion and two - fermion many - particle states can be accessed by means of an oscillating detuning , that gives rise to a time - dependent @xmath64 .    _ step 1 : _ let us start by explaining how to vary the laser parameters to prepare the ground state @xmath157 . in particular , when setting @xmath215 , the ground state of the system at @xmath201 coincides with the initial state @xmath211 . with increasing @xmath19 , it is adiabatically connected to the ground state @xmath157 of @xmath63 ( see fig .

    "this increases the energy gap between @xmath211 and other energy levels , and , as a consequence , suppresses non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "this initial detuning can be decreased as @xmath19 increases so that in the desired regime , i.e. , @xmath218 , it is set to zero . as an example , we propose the following shapes of @xmath219 and @xmath196 @xmath220\\label{eqn : detuning}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the obtained fidelity @xmath221 for different values of the initial detuning @xmath212 and time intervals @xmath222 is given in fig .",

    "note that the timescale of this whole process is limited by the lifetime of the rydberg state .     when populating the ground state of @xmath52 from the initial state via variation of the parameters of the laser @xmath219 and @xmath196 in the form given by ( @xmath227 ) and ( [ eqn : detuning ] ) , respectively .",
    "several initial values of the detuning and time intervals , as well as different lattice sizes , are considered . for a fixed value of @xmath212 ( units of @xmath44 ) ,",
    "better fidelities are obtained for larger time intervals ( units of @xmath228 ) . for a fixed time interval , there is an optimal value of @xmath212 for each size of the lattice , around @xmath229.,width=340 ]    if there is only one atom per site , and based on the fact that @xmath230 is a product state , an alternative procedure to this adiabatic passage can be envisaged .",
    "starting from the vacuum @xmath211 ( also a product state with every atom in @xmath4 ) , we perform a global @xmath231-pulse to the single - atom transition @xmath232 . as a result",

    "it is worth remarking that this method eliminates the lifetime limitation in this first stage .",

[",
    "fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "we exploit this fact and introduce an oscillating detuning of the form @xmath236 . if we tune @xmath237 to coincide with the gap between two given states , this detuning acts effectively as a laser that couples them resonantly with a rabi frequency that is proportional to @xmath238 .    using this oscillating detuning , we want to transfer the population from the ground to the first excited state ( fig .",

    ", we can choose a not too large value of @xmath19 .",
    "in this regime , the second order level shifts caused by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , that are roughly given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ( see section [ sec : energy ] ) , become increasingly important . in particular , as it is sketched in fig . [",
    "fig : excitation]a , the gap between @xmath240 and any of the @xmath151 levels becomes more and more different from @xmath241 and , as a consequence , the unwanted transitions fall out of resonance .",
    "analogously , the same procedure could be used to address the two - fermion many - particle states ( see fig . [",
    "fig : excitation]b ) .",
    "the first @xmath207-pulse resonant with the @xmath242 transition , is followed by another @xmath207-pulse with @xmath237 tuned to coincide with the energy gap of the specific @xmath243 transition , @xmath244 .",
    "the separation between neighboring @xmath151 states is of the order of @xmath44 and the rabi frequency of the transition is proportional to @xmath238 . as a consequence , to populate only a single level of the two - fermion manifold , the parameters have to accomplish that @xmath245 and , at the same time , @xmath238 has to be large enough in order to perform the transfer at a time interval that is much shorter than the lifetime of the rydberg state .    . *",

    "in this work we have studied the collective excitation of a laser - driven rydberg gas confined to a ring lattice .",
    "we have focused on the regime in which the interaction between the highly excited states is much weaker than the laser field .",
    "we found that the corresponding system can be described as a chain of spinless fermions whose dynamics is driven by the @xmath53-model .",
    "this hamiltonian can be analytically solved and , by exploiting the symmetries of the system , we were able to completely characterize the many - particle states arising .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the first excited state of the hamiltonian corresponds to a spin wave or to an excitation which is completely delocalized all over the lattice .",
    "the two - fermion states could be expressed as a superposition of excitation pairs and an investigation of their density - density correlation function has been performed .",
    "we have demonstrated that the qualitative behavior of these correlations differs substantially from one state to another of the same two - fermion manifold , going from a smoothly decaying function to a pronounced correlation - anticorrelation pattern .",

    "finally , we have investigated several paths for the selective excitation of the many - particle states .",
    "one of them relies on the variation of the laser parameters with time , finding trajectories from the initial to a given final many - body state .",
    "the other possibility we have presented makes use of an oscillating detuning which allows to access excitations starting from the ground state of the hamiltonian . in each step , a @xmath207-pulse is performed with the frequency of the oscillation matching the energy gap between the involved states .    throughout this work",
    "we have considered an homogeneous occupation of the sites of the ring lattice .",
    "the situation of having a randomly fluctuating number of atoms per site would effectively lead to a disorder potential for the fermions , as outlined in ref .",
    "this would imply as well a change in the symmetry properties of the system , so that more states become accessible by a time - evolution ( e.g. , @xmath177 possible single - fermion states instead of only the fully - symmetric one ) .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that the atoms are strongly localized , @xmath248 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "taking into consideration the finite width of the wave packet would lead to another kind of disorder , this time associated to the interaction parameter @xmath44 .    as we have pointed out",
    ", the main problem one has to face in this system is the limited lifetime of the rydberg states , which is in the order of several microseconds .",
    "one could think of preparing a parallel system to the one described in this work but using polar molecules @xcite , to overcome this lifetime limitation .",
    "an interesting extension is also the investigation of the system in two - dimensional geometries , e.g. , triangular or square lattices , as well as several rings disposed in concentric or cylindric configurations . in all these cases",
