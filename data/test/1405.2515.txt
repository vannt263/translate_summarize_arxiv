    "the latter approach for explanation of the acceleration expansion is based on the modification of the underlying theory of gravity on large scales such as @xmath5 gravity @xcite and braneworld scenarios @xcite .    among various models of de ,",
    "the so called ghost dark energy ( gde ) has attracted a lot of interests in recent years .",
    "the origin of de in this model comes from veneziano ghosts in qcd theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , the contribution of the ghosts field to the vacuum energy in curved space or time - dependent background can be regarded as a possible candidate for de @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this vacuum energy is of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hubble parameter and @xmath8 is the qcd mass scale . with @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 gives the right order of magnitude @xmath12 for the observed dark energy density @xcite .",
    "the advantages of gde model compared to other de models is that it is totally embedded in standard model and general relativity , therefore one needs not to introduce any new parameter , new degree of freedom or to modify gravity .",
    "the dynamical behavior of gde model in flat universe have been studied @xcite .",
    "the study was also generalized to the universe with spacial curvature @xcite .",
    "the instability of the gde model against perturbations was studied in @xcite . in @xcite the correspondence between gde and scalar field models of de",

    "the gde model was investigated in @xcite .",
    "other features of the gde model have been investigated in refs .",
    "the cosmological constraints on this model have been considered by some authors @xcite .",
    "scalar tensor theories have been reconsidered extensively , recently .",
    "one important example of the scalar tensor theories is the bd theory of gravity which was introduced by brans and dicke in 1961 to incorporate the mach s principle in the einstein s theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "this theory also passes the observational tests in the solar system domain @xcite .",
    "in addition , bd theory can be tested by the cosmological observations such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "since the gde model have a dynamic behavior , it is more reasonable to consider this model in a dynamical framework such as bd theory .",
    "it was shown that some features of gde in bd cosmology differ from einstein s gravity @xcite .",
    "for example , while the original de is instable in all range of the parameter spaces in standard cosmology @xcite , it leads to a stable phase in bd theory @xcite . in the framework of bd cosmology",
    ", the ghost model of de has been studied @xcite .",
    "it is also of great interest to see whether the gde model in the framework of the bd theory is compatible with observational data or not .    in this paper , cosmological constraints on gde in the bd theory ( gdebd )",
    "@xcite theory is performed by using the marko chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation .",
    "the used observational datasets are as follows : cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) from wmap7 @xcite , 557 union2 dataset of type ia supernova @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) from sdss dr7 @xcite , and the cluster x - ray gas mass fraction from the chandra x - ray observations @xcite . to put the constraints , the modified cosmomc @xcite code is used .",

    "nowadays , there are some evidences in favor of closed universe with a small positive curvature ( @xmath23 ) @xcite . using metric ( [ metric ] ) , the field equations ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) reduce to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hubble parameter , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively",

    "here we propose the case where there is an interaction between gde and dm . in this case",
    "the semi - conservation equations read @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the interaction term between dark matter and dark energy and here we assume that the baryonic matter is conserved separately .",
    "we assume @xmath34 with @xmath35 being a constant .",
    "such a choice for interacting term implies the the de and dm component do not conserve separately while the total density is still conserved through @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the ghost energy density is proportional to the hubble parameter @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is roughly of order @xmath41 and @xmath42 is qcd mass scale .",
    "taking into account the fact that @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the present time , this gives the right order of magnitude @xmath45 for the ghost energy density @xcite .",
    "since the system of equations ( [ fe1]-[fe3 ] ) is not closed , we still have another degree of freedom in analyzing the set of equations . as usual",
    "we assume the bd scalar field @xmath15 has a power law relation versus the scale factor , @xmath46 an interesting case is when @xmath47 is small whereas @xmath3 is high so that the product @xmath48 results of order unity @xcite . in section [ sec :",
