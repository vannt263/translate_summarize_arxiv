    "the study of critical phenomena is one of the most fascinating topics in physics : phase transitions are processes that physicists continuously encounter in their investigations of nature , and they can occur in an incredible variety of systems .",
    "a phase transition is basically a change in the order of a system : by varying some parameter ( usually the temperature ) , the microscopic constituents of the system , that we here call ` spins ' , choose a different way of staying together .",
    "if we go from high to low temperatures , we see that one passes from a situation in which the behaviour of each spin is totally independent of the others , to a situation in which several spins are correlated with each other and form ordered structures in the body of the system .",
    "these structures are local realizations of the new phase @xcite .",
    "if we further lower the temperature , the size of the ordered regions increases , until most of them stick to each other and form a domain which spans the whole system . when this happens , the system is in a new state of order , i.e. in a new phase .",
    "this mechanism led already at the end of the 40 s @xcite to the idea that the physics of the phase transition is basically governed by the ordered domains built by the spin - spin correlations , and not by the individual spins .",
    "if the degrees of freedom relevant for the phase change are the ones of sets of particles , and not of single particles , it is likely that they do not depend on the details of the microscopic interaction , but only on its gross features ( e.g. symmetries ) .",
    "that could explain why whole classes of systems , ruled by dynamics which appear very different from each other , happen to have the same behaviour at the phase transition .",
    "in particular , for second - order phase transitions , this simple picture could allow to explain the universality of the critical indices .",
    "percolation theory @xcite is the ideal framework for a geometrical description of phase transitions .",
    "the percolation phenomenon takes place when geometrical _ clusters _ , formed by elementary objects of some system , stick to each other giving rise to an infinite network , that spans the whole system .",
    "the analogy with the phase transition mechanism described above is evident , but there is much more than that .",
    "the real amazing thing is the fact that , in spite of the apparently different nature of percolation , which is a purely geometrical phenomenon , and second - order thermal phase transitions , these two types of processes are formally identical , as they are characterized by the same basic features , which are :    * power law behaviour of the variables near the critical point , with relative exponents ; * scaling relations between the exponents ; * universality of the critical indices .",
    "the temptation to identify a continuous thermal phase transition with a simple percolation transition is then very strong .",
    "this identification is possible provided one can establish a one - to - one correspondence between thermal and percolation variables .",
    "the main percolation variables are :    * the percolation strength @xmath3 , i.e. the probability that a site chosen at random belongs to a percolating cluster ; * the average cluster size @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of clusters with @xmath7 sites and the sums exclude eventual percolating clusters .",
    "suppose we have defined how to group the spins of the configurations of a given model in clusters .",
    "such clusters are the ` physical ' clusters or _ droplets _ of the model if the following conditions are satisfied :    * the percolation point coincides with the thermal critical point ; * the connectedness length ( average cluster radius ) diverges as the thermal correlation length ( same exponent ) ; * the percolation strength @xmath3 near the threshold varies like the order parameter @xmath8 of the model ( same exponent ) ; * the average cluster size @xmath4 diverges as the physical susceptibility @xmath9 ( same exponent ) .",
    "the first studies in this direction concerned the ising model .",
    "the simplest clusters one can think of are just the magnetic domains , i.e. the clusters built by joining nearest - neighbour spins of the same sign . in two dimensions these clusters indeed percolate at the critical temperature of the ising model @xcite ; however , the critical percolation exponents differ from the thermal ones @xcite .",
    "so , the magnetic domains are not the ising droplets .",
    "it was soon realized that the problem of these clusters is that they are too big due to purely geometrical effects .",
    "the average cluster size would be non - negligible also at extremely high temperatures , just because spins of the same sign may happen to lie close to each other , even in the absence of a physical correlation between them . in order to eliminate these artificial geometrical correlations",
    ", one can introduce a bond probability @xmath0 and join nearest - neighbouring spins with this probability , which automatically reduces the size of the clusters .",
    "since the correlation changes with the temperature @xmath10 , @xmath0 must be as well a function of @xmath10 .",
    "if one chooses the expression @xmath11 @xcite ( @xmath12 is the ising coupling ) , the corresponding site - bond clusters are indeed the critical droplets of the ising model , in any dimension @xcite .",
    "nobody can yet say whether the phase transition of every model can be geometrically described as a percolation transition , i.e. whether one can always define the droplets .",
    "the ising result , which is valid more in general for the @xmath13-state potts model , can easily be extended to several spin systems , both discrete and continuous @xcite . in general",
    ", one finds that each interaction between a pair of spins corresponds to a bond in the percolation picture with an analogous bond probability as in ising . in models with several spin - spin interactions of the same type ( all ferro- or antiferromagnetic )",
    ", one can still define a percolation picture @xcite by putting bonds between any pair of interacting spins with some probability , but the picture becomes quite involved : if two interacting spins are far from each other , the geometrical bond between them looks virtual , as the two spins are geometrically disconnected .    recent investigations @xcite aimed at recovering the importance of the role of geometrical connectivity in the mapping between percolation and thermal critical behaviour . in @xcite it was shown that , for a wide class of bidimensional models , one can define simple site - bond clusters which show all features the droplets should have . for the models where a rigorous mapping between percolation and critical behaviour is possible , such site - bond clusters are in general different from the `` exact '' droplets ( see @xcite ) , which are in general more complex , even if their behaviour at criticality is identical . moreover , the result remains valid as well for models with competitive interactions ( e.g. ferromagnetic + antiferromagnetic ) , for which an exact definition of the droplets is , at present , missing . in @xcite",
    "one examined theories with center symmetry @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that their critical behaviour is in the universality class of the model obtained by removing all interactions except the nearest - neighbour one ( ising for @xmath14 , 3-state potts for @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , for these models the nearest - neighbour spin - spin coupling is the fundamental interaction which determines the behaviour at the phase transition .",
    "this is probably the reason why , if one just considers geometrical connections between nearest - neighbours , weighted by some suitable bond probability , the corresponding clusters are at least a good approximation of the critical droplets of the model .",
    "the previous argument is of course independent of the number @xmath16 of space dimensions of the system .",
    "for this reason we believe that the result of @xcite must be valid in general , i.e. for @xmath17 as well . in this paper",
    "we review the 2-dimensional results presented in @xcite and provide numerical evidence , based on monte carlo simulations , that our droplet definition holds true also in three dimensions .",
    "we stress that the original target of our investigations was to provide a geometrical description in terms of percolation of the confinement - deconfinement transition in @xmath2 gauge theories .",
    "early attempts focused on @xmath18 pure gauge theory , whose deconfining transition is second - order and in the universality class of the ising model @xcite .",
    "the strategy we followed at that stage was to approximate the gauge model by means of simpler polyakov loop effective theories for which an exact droplet definition exists @xcite .",
    "in this way one finds only an approximate solution of the problem , which strongly depends on the specific lattice regularization one chooses @xcite .",
    "this seemed to us unsatisfactory : the droplet prescription we propose here solves the problem in a simple and general way .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section ii we discuss more in detail our droplet definition ; in section iii we present the results of our simulations , distinguishing between spin models and @xmath18 pure gauge theory ; finally the conclusions of our work are exposed .",
    "our droplet candidates are clusters built by joining nearest - neighbour spins of the same sign with a bond probability @xmath0 : they are then uniquely defined once we specify @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",
    "the following criterion was proposed : @xmath0 is the minimal probability that still makes percolation possible at the critical temperature @xmath1 . this special minimal probability , that we will call @xmath19 , depends on the model at study .",
    "we recall that @xmath19 is in general a function of the temperature , like in the ising model ( where @xmath20 ) .",
    "we are only interested in the behaviour at the transition , i.e. near @xmath1",
    ". therefore what matters is basically only the value @xmath21 of the bond weight at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is why , referring to @xmath0 ( @xmath19 ) , we use the term `` value '' instead of `` expression '' .    in two dimensions , for any @xmath22 , the percolation temperature @xmath23 and the exponents are in the universality class of 2d pure random percolation . on the other hand , for any @xmath24 ( including the pure - site case @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 , but the exponents do not coincide either with the thermal or with the random percolation ones . for @xmath27 and only in this case ,",
    "the site - bond clusters satisfy all conditions required for the droplets , i.e. both the critical temperature and the exponents of the geometrical transition are equal to the thermal counterparts .",
    "we see that there is a whole range of @xmath0 values , i.e. @xmath28 , for which the relative site - bond clusters begin to percolate exactly at the onset of the thermal transition .",
    "such feature is specific of bidimensional lattices . in three dimensions",
    "we shall see that there is just a single value of the bond probability @xmath0 for which the percolation threshold is exactly at @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath0 is greater than this value , the clusters begin to percolate at some @xmath29 .",
    "however , this asymmetry between the 2d and the 3d cases does not represent a serious problem . in the ising model , by using the fortuin - kasteleyn bond weight @xmath30 , one obtains the correct droplets in any dimension @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the 3-dimensional ising model , @xmath21 is necessarily the unique @xmath0 value for which the two thresholds coincide @xcite .",
    "this special @xmath0 value is again the minimal probability one needs in order to have a percolating cluster at @xmath1 , so that the `` criterion of the minimal bond probability '' adopted in @xcite would lead to the correct droplet definition in three dimensions too , at least in the ising case .",
    "we then assume that such criterion is valid more in general , and we shall verify its validity by computer simulations of two models in three dimensions , the @xmath31 spin model and @xmath18 lattice gauge theory .",
    "our aim is to investigate the percolation transition of special site - bond clusters , determining in particular the percolation temperature and the critical exponents .    to produce the equilibrium configurations we made use of standard monte carlo algorithms , like metropolis or heat bath ; for some models we adopted cluster updates , like the wolff algorithm , which allows to reduce sensibly the correlation of the data and save a lot of cpu time . at each iteration ,",
    "once the configuration to be examined is determined , all lattice sites are grouped in clusters by means of the algorithm devised by hoshen and kopelman @xcite ; for the cluster labeling we have always used free boundary conditions .",
    "after that we are left with a set of clusters of various sizes , and we can calculate the percolation variables .",
    "if a cluster connects the top with the bottom side ( face in 3d ) of the lattice , we say that it percolates @xcite .",
    "besides the percolation strength @xmath3 and the average cluster size @xmath4 , we also calculate the size @xmath32 of the largest cluster of the configuration , since from it one can derive the fractal dimension @xmath33 of the spanning cluster at the threshold @xcite . at each iteration the energy density @xmath34 and the lattice average @xmath8 of the order parameter of the thermal transition were also stored @xcite .",
    "the first step is of course the determination of the percolation temperature .",
    "this can be effectively done by using a variable that can be extracted from the data sample of the percolation strength @xmath3 .",
    "suppose we have performed a number @xmath35 of iterations for one of our models at a given temperature and lattice size .",
    "looking at the column of the @xmath3 data , say @xmath36 the number of configurations of our sample with ( at least ) a percolating cluster ( for those configurations @xmath37 ) . the ratio @xmath38 is the _ percolation cumulant _ @xmath39 , which shares the same properties of the well - known binder cumulant , namely :",
    "1 .   if one plots @xmath39 as a function of @xmath10 , all curves corresponding to different lattice sizes cross at the same temperature @xmath40 , which marks the threshold of the percolation transition ; 2 .",
    "the percolation cumulants for different values of the lattice size @xmath41 coincide , if considered as functions of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the exponent of the connectedness length ) ; 3 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 at @xmath40 is a universal quantity , i.e. it labels a well defined set of critical indices .",
    "the first property suggests that it is enough to make simulations on two different lattices to determine the critical point .",
    "the result is of course the more precise the larger the size of the lattices .    after evaluating the percolation temperature @xmath40 , we extracted the values of the critical indices by means of standard finite - size scaling techniques at the critical point .",
    "if corrections to scaling do not play an important role , the finite - size scaling laws of the percolation variables at @xmath40 are given by the simple formulas    @xmath45    where @xmath41 is the lattice side and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the exponents that rule the power law behaviour at criticality of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . in order to improve the precision of the fits and to keep disturbing finite - size effects under control , for each model",
    "four to six different lattices were used . in all our analyses we found that corrections to scaling do not perturb appreciably the leading behaviour expressed by eqs .",
    "( 2)-(4 ) .",
    "we start by reviewing the investigations of the bidimensional models presented in @xcite .",
    "there , we analyzed two classes of systems : models with @xmath14 global symmetry and a magnetization transition with ising exponents and models with @xmath15 global symmetry and a magnetization transition with exponents belonging to the 2-dimensional 3-state potts model universality class .",
    "the spin systems belonging to the first group are :    1 .   the ising model , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) ; 2 .   a model with nearest - neighbour ( nn ) ferromagnetic coupling and a weaker next - to - nearest ( ntn ) antiferromagnetic coupling : @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath50 ) ; 3 .   the continuous ising model , @xmath55 ( @xmath49 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "the models belonging to the second group are :    1 .   the 3-state potts model , @xmath57 ( @xmath49 , @xmath58 ) ; 2 .   a model obtained by adding to 1 ) a weaker next - to - nearest ( ntn ) antiferromagnetic coupling : @xmath59 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath58 ) ;    the strategy we followed in the numerical analysis was to tune by hand the value of the bond probability @xmath0 until , at the critical temperature @xmath1 of the model , the percolation cumulant @xmath39 takes the same value for each of the lattices we used .",
    "the smallest @xmath0 value for which this is still possible is the minimal bond probability @xmath19 we look for .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath39 gives a strong indication on the universality class of the geometrical transition ( property 3 of the percolation cumulant ) . to calculate the error on @xmath19 we decreased @xmath0 until the @xmath39 values of all lattices at @xmath1 were offset by more than one @xmath60 .    from a strictly numerical point of view one",
    "should take care to interpret the data of the simulations when @xmath0 is close to @xmath19 . in this case , in fact ,",
    "the system finds itself in the neighbourhood of a discontinuity and if the lattice is not large enough , its behaviour is influenced by that .",
    "the simulations on small lattices would produce configurations which represent a sort of mixture of the two situations at @xmath27 and @xmath61 . to recover the real behaviour of the system",
    "one should then go to very large lattices and disregard the small ones .    in two dimensions , as we said above",
    ", there is a whole range of @xmath0 values such that the onset of the percolation transition is exactly at the thermal critical point .",
    "the calculation of the exponents is then crucial to distinguish the various geometrical transitions .",
    "we start by discussing the spin systems with @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the threshold value of the percolation cumulant @xmath39 in the ising model as a function of the bond probability @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath62 we plotted the value of @xmath39 for the largest lattice we took ( @xmath63 ) , as @xmath39 changes sensibly with the lattice size for the reason we explained above @xcite .    the vertical dashed line in the plot marks the minimal probability @xmath64 .",
    "we see that the cumulant is quite stable to the right and to the left of @xmath19 , and that the plateau values correspond to two different universality classes . for @xmath22",
    "the site - bond clusters percolate at a temperature @xmath23 , and the percolation exponents are in the random percolation universality class @xcite . when @xmath24 @xmath26 and the exponents belong to a special universality class ( we call it 2d @xmath14 site percolation universality class because it includes the pure site percolation case , @xmath25 , and is the same for all @xmath14 models we studied ) . for @xmath27",
    "we recover the fortuin - kasteleyn mapping @xcite and the site - bond clusters are the exact critical droplets of the system .",
    "we see that in this case the @xmath39 threshold value does not lie on either of the plateaus , since the exponents are now in a different universality class , i.e. in the class of the 2d ising model .    for the other @xmath14 spin systems the situation is analogous and we could show identical pictures as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , except that the minimal probabilities @xmath19 are different ( @xmath65 for model 2 and @xmath66 for model 3 ) .",
    "we remark that for the continuous ising model we bound nearest - neighbour spins of the same sign , independently of their absolute values , although they play a key role in the definition of the `` exact '' droplets @xcite .",
    "however , there is no proof of the existence of an exact correspondence between the percolation transition of the site - bond clusters for @xmath27 and the magnetization transition .",
    "so it is essential to calculate precisely the critical exponents to show that the `` minimal '' clusters are indeed droplets for the system .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab1 ] , where we can see that the agreement with the critical indices of the 2d ising droplets is very good .",
    ".[tab1 ] critical percolation indices for the site - bond clusters of the @xmath14 models when @xmath27 , compared with the values of the 2d ising droplets .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have shown that the phase transition of many systems can be interpreted as a geometrical percolation transition of simple site - bond clusters , like in the ising model .",
    "we have found a general criterion to define the `` correct '' bond probability @xmath19 of geometrical connection between nearest - neighbouring sites carrying spins of the same sign : @xmath19 is the minimal probability for which it is still possible to have a percolating cluster at the critical temperature @xmath1 of the system .",
    "we remark that this criterion looks a bit artificial , since it imposes by hand the coincidence of the percolation with the thermal threshold .",
    "so , if one studies a new model , it would be impossible to define the droplets until one finds the critical temperature of the system . however , this is not relevant for us , as our aim was just to show that the droplets exist .",
    "we investigated a wide variety of models , from spin systems ( discrete and continuous ) to @xmath18 lattice gauge theory , both in two and in three dimensions . to the extent of these models",
    "our recipe provides indeed a solution of the problem , valid even for systems for which `` exact '' droplets could not so far be identified ( models with competitive interactions , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the generality of the solution is clearly shown by its validity for a complex theory like @xmath18 : the effective theory of the polyakov loop for @xmath2 gauge theory consists of a mixture of many different interactions , short- and long - ranged , ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic , including couplings between more than two spins ( like plaquette - interactions , six - spin couplings , etc . ) and self - interactions .",
    "our analysis is entirely numerical , but the result is most likely exact , as it is for ising .",
    "the droplet definition we propose puts in evidence the key role of geometrical connectivity in the mechanism of the phase transition .",
    "this is easy to understand for the models we have considered , where the nearest - neighbour coupling is by far the most important compared to eventual longer - ranged interactions and determines the critical behaviour .",
    "however this may not be valid when the strength of other couplings is comparable to the nearest - neighbour one : in this case the phase transition could be influenced as well by the other interactions ( e.g. the critical indices might change ) and a droplet definition based only on nearest - neighbour connections is probably inadequate .    in our analysis of the models with @xmath14 symmetry we have seen that the essential spin feature for the droplet definition is the @xmath14 variable , i.e. the sign of the spin .",
    "in fact , we built the clusters in the same way , no matter if the spin is discrete like in ising or continuous like in @xmath18 .",
    "this shows once more the crucial role played by the @xmath14 symmetry , whose spontaneous breaking is indeed responsible for the phase transition .",
    "since the relationship between @xmath2 pure gauge theories and @xmath67 spin models holds for any @xmath68 , our result should be valid for all @xmath2 pure gauge theories with a continuous deconfining transition , i.e. also for @xmath69 and @xmath70 in @xmath71 dimensions .",
    "the special lattice regularization of the gauge theory does not play a role , as the critical behaviour has the same features for any @xmath72 .",
    "so , we found that the confinement - deconfinement phase transition of @xmath2 pure gauge theory , if second - order , is equivalent to a percolation transition of special site - bond clusters of like - signed polyakov loops : this is the most important result of our work .",
    "very recent studies show that percolation can help to describe as well the chiral transition of special fermion lattice models @xcite .",
    "we focused only on systems with a continuous second - order transition because the percolation phenomenon is typically smooth .",
    "this does not mean that we can not use percolation to describe discontinuous phase changes .",
    "the fortuin - kasteleyn mapping @xcite is valid for any @xmath73state potts model in any dimension , and the equivalence between the magnetization and the percolation order parameter holds for first - order phase transitions as well . in this case at the critical point there is a coexistence of a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase , which correspond to two different `` geometrical phases '' , characterized by small and large clusters , respectively .",
    "therefore , the percolation order parameter jumps at the threshold exactly as the magnetization ( from zero to a non - zero value ) . because of that we believe that the criterion of the minimal bond probability we adopted here can be directly extended to systems undergoing a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "now it is however more difficult to support the idea of droplets because there are no critical indices to reproduce .",
    "one could nevertheless try to see whether the percolation variables ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) vary near @xmath1 like their thermal counterparts ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) . in this way one could study in particular the `` physical '' confinement - deconfinement transition of @xmath69 pure gauge theory in @xmath74 dimensions ( quenched @xmath75 ) .",
    "we remark that @xmath0 is always less than one except at zero temperature .",
    "that means that , for any @xmath76 , the geometrical correlations of the spins are stronger than the physical correlations between them . in particular , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and",
