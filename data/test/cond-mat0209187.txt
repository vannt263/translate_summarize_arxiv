    "in a small metallic island where the charging energy @xmath5 exceeds the temperature @xmath6 ( we use the unit @xmath7 ) , the coulomb interaction affects transport properties through the island .",
    "the resulting phenomenon is called the coulomb blockade ( cb ) and such system is named the single - electron transistor ( set ) .",
    "cb has been attracted much attention in the last decade @xcite and the nature of the transport properties of set has been clarified .",
    "set is interesting because it is regarded as one of the most simple examples of strongly correlated system which can be brought into the non - equilibrium state by applied bias voltage .",
    "early investigations consider the case where the tunneling conductance is so small that the higher order quantum fluctuation of island charge is negligible .",
    "recently , the quantum fluctuation in set has attracted much attention as one of the basic problems in this field .",
    "the quantum fluctuation is quantitatively characterized by the dimensionless parallel conductance : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the quantum resistance and @xmath10 is the parallel tunneling resistance of the source and the drain junctions .",

    ", it is predicted that the quantum fluctuation of charge causes the renormalization of the conductance and the charging energy below the kondo temperature \" @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of the conductance is confirmed experimentally as @xmath14 dependence of the conductance peak at low temperature@xcite .",
    "it is also predicted that in the non - equilibrium state , the dissipative charge fluctuation causes the life - time broadening of a charge state level and smears the structures of @xmath15-@xmath16 characteristic@xcite .",
    "though investigations have revealed much about the quantum fluctuation , most of them have been limited to averaged quantities . in order to understand the nature of the quantum fluctuation ,",
    "investigations on the higher - order correlation function of fluctuation operators are required .",
    "a good starting point may be the investigation on the second moment of fluctuation operators , i.e. , the noise@xcite .",
    "the charge noise and the current noise in the weak tunneling regime is also important for practical applications , because it determines the performance of set electrometers @xcite .",
    "the current noise is defined by the auto - correlation function of the current fluctuation operator @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 means the statistical average . until recently",
    ", investigations on the noise have been done using the framework of the orthodox `` theory@xcite , which takes account of the lowest order quantum fluctuation , namely the sequential tunneling ( st ) process .",
    "recently , several authors@xcite discussed the higher order quantum fluctuation in cb regime within the co - tunneling theory''@xcite . however , there is no approximation covering both st and cb regime .",
    "the aim of the present work is to construct a theoretical framework , which covers both of these regimes for arbitrary @xmath11 and clarify how the quantum fluctuation affects the noise .",
    "the keldysh formalism@xcite has been one of the most powerful methods to study the non - equilibrium properties of mesoscopic systems . however to apply this method to set in the two - state limit , one must overcome a technical difficulty : the spin-1/2 operator , which is introduced to restrict charge number states by the strong coulomb interaction , prevents one from utilizing wick s theorem .",

    ", we investigate the current noise and the charge noise in the regime of large quantum fluctuation of charge out of equilibrium .",

    "schwinger - keldysh approach enables us to calculate any order moment systematically by the functional derivative technique@xcite satisfying the charge conservation@xcite , and it helps us in manipulating many complicated terms .",
    "the drone - fermion representation allows us to utilize the fermionic wick s theorem and to take effects of the strong correlation into account . with the help of this technique",
