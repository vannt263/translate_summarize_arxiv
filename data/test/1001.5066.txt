    "the einstein - maxwell-(dilaton-(axion ) ) or -(chern - simons ) theories in different dimensionalities have been extensively explored from many different directions .",
    "the black hole solutions have been considered in @xcite as well as solitonic and gravitational instantons , dyonic and pp - wave solutions in @xcite , supergravity solutions in @xcite , brane worlds and cosmology in @xcite , nut and bolt solutions , liouville potential , rotating solutions and string theory extensions of einstein - maxwell fields in @xcite .",
    "the atiyah - hitchin space is a part of the set of two monopole solutions of bogomolnyi equation .",
    "the moduli space of solutions is a product of @xmath0 ( that describes the center of mass of two monopoles and a phase factor that is related to the total electric charge of the system ) and a four dimensional manifold @xmath1 , which has self - dual curvature .",
    "the self - duality comes from the hyper - khler property of the moduli space .",
    "a further aspect concerning @xmath1 is that it should be rotational invariant , since two monopoles do exist in ordinary flat space ; hence the metric on @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of three functions of the monopole separation .",
    "self - duality implies that these three functions obey a set of first - order ordinary differential equations .",
    "this space has been used recently for construction of five - dimensional three - charge supergravity solutions that only have a rotational @xmath2 isometry @xcite as well as construction of m - brane solutions @xcite .",
    "moreover , atiyah - hitchin space and its various generalizations were identified with the full quantum moduli space of @xmath3 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions @xcite . moreover , in the context of string theory and brane world , investigations on black hole ( ring ) solutions in higher dimensions have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "it is believed that in the strong coupling limit , many horizonless three - charge brane configurations undergo a geometric transition and become smooth horizonless geometries with black hole or black ring charges @xcite .",
    "these charges come completely from fluxes wrapping on non - trivial cycles .",
    "the three - charge black hole ( ring ) systems are dual to the states of corresponding conformal field theories : in favor of the idea that non - fundamental - black hole ( ring ) systems effectively arise as a result of many horizonless configurations @xcite . in eleven - dimensional supergravity , there are solutions based on transverse four - dimensional hyper - khler metrics ( which are equivalent to metrics with self - dual curvatures ) .",
    "the hyper - khlericity of transverse metric guarantees ( at least partially ) to have supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "there are also many solutions to five - dimensional minimal supergravity . in five - dimensions , unlike the four dimensions that the only horizon topology is 2-sphere , we can have different more interesting horizon topologies such as black holes with horizon topology of 3-sphere @xcite , black rings with horizon topology of 2-sphere @xmath4 circle @xcite , black saturn : a spherical black hole  surrounded by a black ring @xcite , black lens which the horizon geometry is a lens space @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "all allowed horizon topologies have been classified in @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown how a uniqueness theorem might be proved for black holes in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "it was shown stationary , asymptotically flat vacuum black holes with two commuting axial symmetries are uniquely determined by their mass , angular momentum and rod structure .",
    "specifically , the rod structure @xcite determines the topology of horizon in five dimensions . in references",
    "@xcite , the authors constructed different solutions of five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory based on four - dimensional self - dual metrics .",
    "some of solutions describe ( multi ) black hole solutions with and without cosmological constant .    motivated by these facts , in this article we try to construct solutions to five - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory with positive cosmological constant , based on atiyah - hitchin space . to our knowledge , these solutions are the first solutions to einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory with positive cosmological constant that the base space ca nt be written in gibbons - hawking form . moreover , our five dimensional solutions interpolate between a bolt structure to gibbons - perry - sorkin monopole solutions on the boundary .",
    "we note that hyper - khler atiyah - hitchin geometries ( unlike gibbons - hawking geometries ) do not have any tri - holomorphic @xmath2 isometry , hence our solutions could be used to study the physical processes in spacetimes with positive cosmological constant that do not respect any tri - holomorphic @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec:5dreview ] ,",
    "we review briefly the einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory with positive cosmological constant , the atiyah - hitchin space and its features . in section [ sec : sol ] , we present our cosmological solutions based on two forms for the atiyah - hitchin space and discuss the asymptotics of the solutions . we conclude in section [ sec : con ] with a summary of our solutions and possible future research directions .",
    "we consider the five dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the action is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are five dimensional ricci scalar and maxwell filed .",
    "the einstein and maxwell equations are @xmath9 respectively .",
    "we take the following form for the five - dimensional metric @xmath10and the only non - vanishing component of gauge field as @xmath11where @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the atiyah - hitchin metric @xmath14 is given by the following manifestly @xmath15 invariant form @xcite @xmath16where @xmath17 are maurer - cartan one - forms ( see appendix ) .",
    "the metric ( ahmetric ) satisfies einstein s equations provided@xmath18 choosing * *  * * @xmath19 * *  * * , we can find the explicit expressions for the metric functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 in terms of elliptic integrals ( see appendix ) .",
    "in fact as @xmath22 the metric ( [ ahmetric ] ) reduces to @xmath23which is the well known euclidean taub - nut metric with a negative nut charge @xmath24 the metric ( [ reducedah ] ) is obtained from a consideration of the limiting behaviors of the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 at large monopole separation ( see appendix ) . on the other hand , near the bolt location , @xmath25 ,",
    "we can write the metric ( [ ahmetric ] ) as@xmath26where we use a new set of coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , related to @xmath29  @xmath30 through some rotations .",
    "we note that the last term in ( [ nearbolt ] ) is the induced metric on the two dimensional bolt .",
    "to find the five - dimensional metric function @xmath31 , we consider equations of motion ( [ eeq]-[geq ] ) .",
    "the metric ( [ ds5 ] ) and the gauge field ( [ gauge5 ] ) are solutions to einstein - maxwell equations with positive cosmological constant , provided @xmath31 is a solution to the differential equation , @xmath32 the solution to this partial differential equation is given by @xmath33 where the function @xmath34 is @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , two constants of integration .",
    "although the @xmath38-dependences of metric functions @xmath39 , are given explicitly in equations ( [ abc1]-[abc3 ] ) , it s unlikely to find an analytic expression for @xmath34 given by ( [ hsol ] ) .",
    "as @xmath40 , the metric function ( [ hsol ] ) goes to @xmath41 on the other hand , near bolt , the metric function @xmath34 has a logarithmic divergence as @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "this type of divergence in the metric function has been observed previously in the metric function of m2-brane in a transverse atiyah - hitchin space @xcite .",
    "we note that setting @xmath44 in ( [ hhh ] ) yields the solutions of einstein - maxwell equations with no cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "as we noticed , we could not find a closed analytic expression for the metric function given in ( [ hsol ] ) . to overcome this problem",
    ", we choose @xmath45 in ( [ ahmetric ] ) to be @xmath46 and so the atiyah - hitchin metric reads @xmath47 where functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 satisfy equations ( [ conditions1]-[conditions3 ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath51 means @xmath52 . by introducing the new functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 such that @xmath55 the set of equations ( [ conditions1]-[conditions3 ] ) with @xmath50 reduces onto a darboux - halpern system @xmath56 we can find the solutions to the above equations as @xmath57 where @xmath58 the new coordinate @xmath59 is related to the coordinate @xmath60 by @xmath61 the coordinate @xmath59 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath60 ; takes values over @xmath62 $ ] if the coordinate @xmath60 is chosen to take values on @xmath63 $ ] . the function @xmath64 has an increasing behavior from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . at @xmath67 , the function @xmath68 reaches to maximum value @xmath69 and decreases then to zero at @xmath70 .",
    "hence , in the range of @xmath71 , @xmath68 is positive and so the change of variables , given in ( [ theta ] ) , is completely well defined .",
    "the functions @xmath72 are always negative and @xmath73 is always positive , hence , equations ( [ psis1 ] , [ psis2 ] , [ psis3 ] ) show the metric functions always are positive . in figure ( [ abcs ] ) , the behaviors of functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 versus @xmath59 are plotted .",

    "the killing vectors of gross - perry - sorkin monopole solution ( [ asymp ] ) are @xmath96 and all of them are space - like .",
    "so , we conclude our solution ( [ ah5ex ] ) is a non - stationary solution .",
    "there is a singualrity at @xmath97 which can be avoided by choosing sign of @xmath77 opposite to that of @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , to avoid any singularity at @xmath98 and to get a regular positive definite metric , we should choose @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    on the other extreme limit where @xmath101 , ( or @xmath102 ) , we find the metric ( [ ah5ex ] ) changes to @xmath103 where @xmath104 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the metric ( [ bol2 ] ) shows a bolt at @xmath105 since ricci scalar and kretschman invariant of the metric ( [ bol2 ] ) diverge on bolt location @xmath105 .",
    "as it is well known , in both asymptotically ads / ds spacetimes , there is a natural correspondence between phenomena occurring near the boundary ( or in the deep interior ) of either spacetime and uv ( ir ) physics in the dual cft .",
