    "as a mechanism to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe , the electroweak baryogenesis is given wide attentions , since it can be tested in the future high energy experiments [ 1 ] .",
    "sakharov have several decades ago established the three essential conditions for generating dynamically the baryon asymmetry of the universe from a baryon - symmetric universe [ 2 ] .",
    "as is well known , the three conditions are the presence of baryon number violation , the violation of both c and cp , and a departure from thermal equilibrium",
    ". the possibility of the electroweak phase transition has already been exhaustively studied , which can provide the baryon number violation and the violation of both c and cp .",
    "the remaining sakharov condition , the departure from thermal equilibrium , may be fulfilled at a weak scale temperatures if the nature of the electroweak phase transition is first order .",
    "the difficulty of the standard model ( sm ) is that the strength of the first order electroweak phase transition , which must be strong enough for preserving the generated baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale , appears too weak for the experimentally allowed mass of the sm scalar higgs boson [ 3 ] .",
    "thus , it seems that electroweak baryogenesis requires a new physics beyond the sm at weak scale [ 4 ] .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has been studied intensively within the context of electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "it is observed that , if one of the scalar top quark has a mass smaller than top quark mass , the mssm may possess a parameter region where the electroweak phase transition is strong enough [ 5 ] . in this scenario of a light scalar top quark ,",
    "the requirement that the electroweak phase transition should be strongly first order is equivalent to the imposition of an upper bound of about 120 gev on the lightest higgs scalar boson mass of the mssm .    in any supersymmetric standard model , there are superpartners to ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "experimentally , no scalar quark or scalar lepton that is lighter than 5 gev has been discovered .",
    "thus , the ordinary quarks and leptons , up to bottom quark , are lighter than their corresponding superpartners .",
    "possibly , top quark might be an exception , if a scalar top quark is lighter than top quark .",
    "the idea that a scalar top quark might be lighter than top quark is not in accord with the behavior of lighter fermions , but is allowed by present experiment and accommodated in the mssm within the context of the electroweak phase transition . if the scalar top quarks are not degenerate in mass , the @xmath0 mass matrix for the scalar top quarks yields a lighter scalar top quark and a heavier one in the mssm . in order for the electroweak phase transition to be strongly first order",
    ", the mass of the scalar top quark should be either smaller than 170 gev or larger than 1 tev .",
    "thus , the lighter scalar top quark should have a mass smaller than 170 gev .",
    "the heavier scalar top quark may have a mass comparable to the susy breaking scale , say , between 1 and 2 tev .",
    "a light scalar top quark suggested in the mssm scenario , which depends strongly on chargino and neutralino masses , might soon face experimental examination at tevatron .",
    "the possibility of a scalar top quark heavier than top quark has been considered in scenarios other than the mssm .",
    "for example , in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , the strongly first order electroweak phase transition takes place where the top quark mass is smaller than the mass of the scalar top quark . within the framework of the mssm",
    ", we need to enlarge the model somehow to accommodate a scalar top quark heavier than top quark .",
    "we examine the possibility for the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition in the mssm by introducing an extra generation of fermions .    in this paper , we study the effect of the fourth generation of quarks on the strength of the first order electroweak phase transition in the mssm .",
    "we find that introducing an extra generation of fermions might also lead to a scalar top quark heavier than top quark .",
    "although the number of the sm neutrino species has already been fixed experimentally as three , one may find a lot of articles in the literature that mention about the fourth generation and study on the assumption of its existence [ 6,7 ] . in principle , the sm , as well as the mssm , can accomodate any number of generations . in various contexts ,",
    "the mssm with four generations has been studied [ 8,9,10 ] .",
    "our study shows that the fourth generation is found to enhance the strength of the first - order electroweak phase transition , while the scalar higgs boson mass is calculated to be larger than the experimental lower bound , and the scalar quarks of the third generations are comparable to the supersymmetry breaking scale ( @xmath1 tev ) , in a reasonably wide region of parameter space in the mssm . in our scenario , a light scalar quark is not necessarily required to ensure the first order electroweak phase transition be strong ; the scalar quarks of the third and the fourth generations may be heavier than the corresponding quarks ; and the scalar higgs boson mass lies above the experimental lower bound .",
    "let us study a particular , yet reasonable as well as plausible , form of the higgs potential in the mssm with four generations of quarks for the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we consider only the third and the fourth generations , and assume that there is no mixing between them .",
    "the fourth generation appears simply in a repetitive manner .",
    "as is well known , there are two higgs doublets in the higgs sector of the mssm , namely , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking emerge five physical higgs bosons : two neutral scalar higgs bosons ( @xmath4 ) , one neutral pseudoscalar higgs bosons ( @xmath5 ) , and a pair of charged higgs bosons ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we assume that the mass of @xmath7 is lighter than that of @xmath8 . at the tree level ,",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm depends on only two free parameters .",
    "we take them to be the ratio @xmath9 of the two real vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath10 of @xmath11 and @xmath12 of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the mass of @xmath5 . in this paper , we assume that cp is conserved in the higgs sector by choosing all parameters in the effective higgs potential to be real .    in the decoupling limit , where @xmath15 , with fixed @xmath16 , only one linear combination of the two neutral scalar higgs bosons , @xmath17 remains light at the electroweak scale [ 11 ] . in this limit",
    ", the tree - level higgs potential at zero temperature can be expressed in terms of @xmath18 as @xmath19 since all quartic terms have gauge coupling coefficients in the mssm , the quartic higgs self - coupling @xmath20 is given as @xmath21 .",
    "note that there is an upper bound on the mass of @xmath7 as @xmath22 at the tree level in the mssm . in this limit ,",
    "the couplings of @xmath7 to gauge bosons and fermions are identical to the couplings of the sm higgs boson , which implies that one can not distinguish phenomenologically the sm scalar higgs boson from @xmath7 [ 12 ] .",
    "thus , one might expect that @xmath23 has the same experimental lower bound as the sm scalar higgs boson in the decoupling limit [ 13 ] .",
    "the current experimental lower bound on the mass of the sm scalar higgs boson is about 114.5 gev .",
    "now , at the one - loop level at zero temperature , the effective higgs potential is given by @xmath24 where the one - loop contribution @xmath25 at zero temperature is obtained via the effective potential method as [ 14 ] @xmath26 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 stands for various participating particles : the gauge bosons @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the third generation quarks and scalar quarks @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as well as the fourth generation quarks and scalar quarks @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the renormalization scale in the above one - loop effective potential is set as @xmath42 .",
    "the degrees of freedom for each particle are : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "their field - dependent masses are given by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 with @xmath57 . in the above expression for the scalar quark masses [ 15 ] , we have @xmath58 and similarly for the fourth generation by substituting with primed quantities , where @xmath59 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the above expressions for the scalar quark masses are given as @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , and similarly for the fourth generation .",
    "note that @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) does not necessarily imply that the right - handed and the left - handed scalar top ( bottom ) quarks are degenerate in mass , since there is @xmath68-term contributions .",
    "only if @xmath68-term contributions to the scalar top ( bottom ) quark masses are neglected , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) would yield degenerate right - handed and left - handed scalar top ( bottom ) quarks .    however , we remark that the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 control the mixings between the scalar top or scalar bottom masses in each generation",
    ". if these parameters are zero , there would be no mixing between right - handed and left - handed scalar quarks of each generation . in this paper , we assume that there is no mixing , taking @xmath69 in the expressions for the scalar quark masses . therefore , we study the mssm higgs potential in the decoupling limit without mixing .",
    "the decoupling limit without mixing is an optimal situation for electroweak phase transition to be strongly first order .",
    "the case without mixing is more favorable for the first order electroweak phase transition to be strong than the case with mixing , as the strength of the electroweak phase transition is found to decrease when the mixings between scalar quarks are taken into account [ 15 ] .",
    "also , one can notice , for example , in fig . 2 of ref . [ 16 ] , that the strength of the electroweak phase transition increases as @xmath14 increases in the mssm with three generations .",
    "thus , we study the mssm higgs potential in circumstances that enhance the first order electroweak phase transition .    now , the renormalized parameter @xmath70 in the higgs potential can be eliminated by the minimum condition . by calculating the first derivative of @xmath71 with respect to @xmath18 , @xmath70",

    "and the negative sign is for bosons and the positive sign for fermions .",
    "the full one - loop effective potential at finite temperature that we are considering can now be expressed as @xmath79 we perform the exact integration in @xmath80 instead of employing the high - temperature approximation .",

    "there are some experimental constraints .",
    "some years ago , tevatron data have set @xmath89 gev , and recently , from the search for long - lived charged massive particles at tevatron come more stringent experimental lower bounds of @xmath90 gev and @xmath91 gev [ 18 ] . with these constraints in mind",
    ", we take @xmath83 = 250 gev and @xmath92 gev . finally , we take 1 tev for the value of @xmath85 from the susy breaking scale @xmath1 tev . thus",
    ", our numerical analysis involves two free parameters : @xmath16 and @xmath86 .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show a typical behavior of @xmath93 as a function of @xmath18 , at a critical temperature @xmath94 gev , where we take @xmath95 and @xmath96 gev .",
    "as one can see in the figure , we obtain the critical vacuum expectation value as @xmath97 = 149 gev , and the ratio as @xmath98 .",
    "one can notice that the potential in fig .",
    "1 allows a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition .",

    "the search for a light higgs boson in the mssm by delphi collaboration without mixing , where only three generations of quarks are taken into account , suggests that @xmath23 is about 115 gev , for @xmath107 [ 19 ] . comparing this number with our result of 129 gev in fig . 1",
    ", we may well deduce that the difference is due to the contribution by the fourth generation of quarks .",
    "the contribution by the fourth generation of quarks also enables the electroweak phase transition strongly first order .",
    "our value is compatible with the result of ref .",
    "[ 8 ] where the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass is obtained as 152 gev for small @xmath16 and @xmath108 gev in the mssm with four generations of quarks .",
