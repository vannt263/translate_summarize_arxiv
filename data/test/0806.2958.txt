    "the lattice structures of consecutive shells are generally uncorrelated with each other , and can even have different chiralities .",
    "in fact , several experiments on mwcnts have indicated that often the different shells have different periodicities.@xcite two consecutive shells of an mwcnt are called commensurate ( incommensurate ) if the ratio of their unit - cell lengths along the cnt axis is rational ( irrational ) , indicating the presence ( absence ) of translational symmetry .",
    "incommensurability affects the transport and optical properties of mwcnts .",
    "@xcite    the critical issue when modeling the electromagnetic properties of an mwcnt is the intershell interaction leading to intershell electron tunneling or hopping .",

    "as may be expected , two incommensurate shells interact differently than two commensurate cells .",
    "@xcite for example , the fermi momentums of two incommensurate shells do not coincide within the first brillouin zone and therefore the intershell tunneling vanishes .",

    "[ fig8](b ) , the value of @xmath272 is less than for an isolated metal wire ( @xmath254 ) and significantly decreases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "these trends can be explained in the following manner .",
    "the guided wave propagates partly inside the mwcnt and partly inside the gold core .",
    "the dissipation in the mwcnt shells is high because the real and the imaginary parts of the surface conductivities of the shells in the interband regime are of comparable magnitudes .",
    "this dissipation increases with frequency , in accordance with the frequency dependence of the effective per - unit - length conductivity of the mwcnt presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "because of the weak electromagnetic coupling of cnt shells , the shells strongly absorb electromagnetic energy independently on each other  which explains the strong dependence of @xmath268 on @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the weak coupling changes the radial electromagnetic field distribution of the surface - plasmon wave only slightly as @xmath1 increases , which explains the weak dependence of @xmath273 on @xmath1 .    the decrease of the magnitude of @xmath268 with increasing @xmath1 increasing implies the enhancement of @xmath117 , the power lost to ohmic dissipation , and consequently the decreasing of the antenna efficiency @xmath186 of an mwcnt with a metal core . however , if @xmath1 is not too large ( @xmath274 or @xmath275 ) some worsening of antenna properties may be justified by other advantages that the metal - core mwcnt may confer .",
    "thus , an mwcnt can operate as an antenna in two different regimes .",
    "the first is the _ drude - conductivity regime _ , wherein the motion of conduction - band electrons is responsible for radiation properties .",
    "this regime has a distinct analogy with a classical radio - frequency wire antenna , as is clear from sec .",
    "[ low - coupling ] and [ num1 ] .",
    "the second regime is the _ interband - transitions regime _ , wherein quantum transitions of electrons between different energy states occur .",
    "this regime was considered in sec .",
    "[ num2 ] and does not have a classical analogy .",
    "the frequency @xmath184 separates the drude - conductivity regime @xmath197 from the interband - transitions regime @xmath198 .",
    "guided - wave propagation and geometric resonances of the guided waves are typical for macroscopic wire antennas .",
    "the guided waves have a quasi - transverse - electromagnetic structure and are characterized by low retardation and low attenuation .",
    "@xcite the existence of guided ( surface ) waves and geometric resonances also is typical for nanowire antennas in the drude - conductivity regime . @xcite",
    "but the guided wave has strong retardation and high attenuation , so that the frequency of a geometric resonance is not connected to the free - space wavelength but to a shorter effective wavelength that depends on the material properties .",
    "@xcite this general rule is also true for mwcnt antennas : fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that guided waves have strong retardation and high attenuation , and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] presents geometric resonances at @xmath276 demonstrating thereby the effective wavelength to be shorter than free - space wavelength .",
    "calculated data presented in fig .  [ fig3](a )",
    "indicate that the retardation coefficient increases when the number of shells increases .",
    "furthermore , the retardation coefficient is the highest for the @xmath144 mode in mwcnts of type m. that implies that a mwcnt with only metallic shells and operating in the @xmath144 mode offers attractive prospects for high antenna efficiencies in the terahertz regime .",
    "the frequency @xmath184 , separating the drude - conductivity regime from the interband - transitions regime , depends on the detailed electronic and geometric attributes of the mwcnt .",
    "according to ( [ freq ] ) , @xmath184 decreases as @xmath17 increases . as examples , for an mwcnt of type a , ( i ) @xmath277 nm and @xmath278  thz when @xmath279 , but ( ii ) @xmath280 nm and @xmath281  thz when @xmath282 . in the interband - transitions regime",
    "@xmath283 , guided - wave propagation and geometric resonances are absent for both swcnts and mwcnts , which cardinally distinguishes this regime from the drude - conductivity regime .",
    "as shown experimentally,@xcite the absorption and the scattering characteristics of an electrically thick mwcnt in the regime of optical transitions depend only slightly on the frequency .",
    "this conclusion , also borne out by the data in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , may be seem to be unexpected .",
    "in fact optical transitions are resonance processes and the surface conductivities of swcnts and mwcnt shells have resonances corresponding to the van hove singularities .",
    "but we found that the antenna parameters of electrically thin mwcnts are determined by the effective parameter @xmath203 defined in ( [ sigm ] ) .",
    "the overlapping of a large number of resonances of the surface conductivities of the different shells leads to a smooth frequency dependence of @xmath203 .",
    "such an effect is analogous to inhomogeneous broadening in an ensemble of all different harmonic oscillators .",
    "thus , within the framework of our model , it is impossible to interpret the observation scattering resonances of random arrays of mwcnts with average outermost radius @xmath5  nm reported in ref .  .",
    "the same conclusion emerged from the model of hao and hansen .",
    "@xcite further experiments are required .",
    "antennas are objects that transform a near - field into a far - field and vice versa .",
    "the morphology of the near field of a nanoantenna possess a nanoscale , and is therefore determined by quantum size effects .",
    "therefore the coupling of a nanoantenna with its near field is stronger than that of a macroscopic antenna with its near field ; as a result , the transformation of the near field to the far field by a nanoantenna is more difficult , and the antenna efficiency of a thin - nanowire antenna is low .",
    "this property is inherent to different types of nanoantennas : swcnts @xcite , bundle of swcnts @xcite , metallic nanorods @xcite , and mwcnts as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . the antenna efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the number of shells in an mwcnt ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , the number of swcnts in a bundle ( fig . 7 in ref .  ) , and the cross - sectional radius of a metallic rod antenna ( fig . 1 in ref .   ) .",
    "we can thus conclude that the small value of antenna efficiency is the fundamental physical characteristic of nanoantennas .",
    "nevertheless , its antenna efficiency is tunable over a wide range .    in order to achieve antenna efficiency close to unity",
    ", it is necessary to strongly suppress the influence of quantum size effects by ensuring that the cross - sectional radius is high .",
    "note that , since quantum size effects are not pronounced in gold nanowires of cross - sectional radius of several tens of nanometers , such nanowire - based antennas are expected to possess properties analogous to macroscopic antennas .",
    "the electromagnetic properties of mwcnts have only a slight frequency - dependence in the interband - transitions regime , per fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "thus , and mwcnt can be considered to be a nanoantenna with sufficiently high @xmath284 ( @xmath285 in fig .  [ fig7 ] ) and a wide operating - frequency range in the visible regime .",
    "such nanoantennas have properties similar to those of electrically small but macroscopic antennas in microwave regimes ( e.g. , short non - resonant dipoles ) . @xcite",
    "to conclude , we modeled the shells of an mwcnt as impedance sheets with axially directed surface conductivity , ignored intershell tunneling of electrons but incorporated intershell coupling , in an integral - equation approach .",
    "calculated data indicate that in a low - frequency regime called the drude - conductivity regime , wherein optical interband transitions do not occur , guided waves can propagate with low attenuation in an mwcnt which has metallic shells . in the same frequency regime",
    ", the axial polarizability of a finite - length mwcnt has a resonant behavior due to the antenna - length matching effect .",
    "however , the shells with surface conductivity due to interband transitions suppress guided - wave propagation",
    ". due of the high dissipation in such shells , mwcnts with outermost radius @xmath286 nm can not possess resonant properties in the visible regime .",
    "analysis of surface - plasmon - wave propagation in a mwcnt with a gold core shows that , in the near - infrared and the visible regimes , the shells behave effectively as lossy dielectric materials and suppress surface - wave propagation along the gold core .      *",
    "the antenna efficiency @xmath186 of an mwcnt exceeds that of an swcnt but is less than that of an almost circular bundle of closely packed , metallic swcnts , provided that all three objects are of roughly the same outermost radius .",

    "filling the core of an mwcnt with a metal makes the mwcnt attractive as a nanoantenna , provided that the number of shells does not exceed 3 .",
