    "ratios of percentiles from a single population may be of direct interest for many disciplines , but in particular it is very often used as a simple measure of income inequality .",
    "for example , in a recent brief discussion of income inequality measures , @xcite remarks that decile ratios are simple but effective .",
    "also , in the inequality literature one often finds estimated ratios of quantiles plotted against the year in which the samples are taken , to illustrate whether inequality is growing or decreasing over time . of course such plots can be misleading , and what is required are inferential methods based on sample ratios",
    "recent contributions to inference for ratios of quantiles based on _ two _ independent samples are found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge there are no published results based on inference for ratios of quantiles based on a single sample .",
    "the main results presented in this paper are first , showing that large sample distribution - free confidence intervals for ratios of quantiles based on standard theory have reliable coverage for moderate sample sizes .",
    "second , even for samples of size 10,000 , the standard errors of ratio estimators can not be ignored ; thus one can not assume that sample ratios are accurate just because the sample size is large.third , showing such procedures are resistant to outliers and to the presence of a small proportion of zero incomes in the population .",
    "the same can not be said for most inequality measures , as shown by @xcite ; although progress in robustifying some of them has been achieved , see @xcite and references therein .    in section  [ sec : abs data ] we examine income data from the australian bureau of statistics , and illustrate how our results can provide useful inferential information . then in section  [ sec : dfcis ] we find distribution free - standard errors for the ratio of quantiles which require distribution - free estimates of the quantile density at the two quantiles defining the ratio .",
    "two interval estimators are described , one based on the studentized log - transformation and the other on a variance stabilization transformation .",
    "simulation studies in section  [ sec : simulations ] show that these intervals rarely have coverage below the nominal level for several distributions that are commonly assumed for income populations , and that the intervals based on variance stabilization have more accurate coverage and smaller widths for small to moderate sample sizes .",
    "similar good results are obtained for data fitted by the generalized lambda distribution ; these are relegated to the appendix , section  [ sec : gld ] . in section  [ sec : contamination ]",
    "the effects of contamination by a point mass of zero incomes or infinitesimal contamination are studied via simulations and influence functions . in section  [ sec : twotest ] interval estimators for the difference between two independent ratios are found effective .",
    "the software r script for computing the intervals is found in section  [ rscript ] , and further research is suggested in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "measuring household income is a complicated task carried out by governmental departments , including the australian bureau of statistics , whose annual reports are available at @xcite .",
    "the gross household income per week is of interest but households differ so much in size that the _ equivalized _ disposal income ( ewi ) is also found , and which the abs defines as ... the amount of disposable cash income that a single person household would require to maintain the same standard of living as the household in question , regardless of the size or composition of the latter .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we list ratios of percentiles from @xcite . while details of how the percentiles were calculated are not reported , the sample size of households each year ranges from 9,345 for 2007 and 18,071 for 2009 .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "are histograms of the ewi data for the financial years beginning 2005 and 2011 , listed in table  [ table7 ] of the appendix , after exclusion of 0 income and income greater than $ 2000 .",
    "below them are density plots of the reconstructed   data sets from which we will obtain our quantile estimates and standard errors .",
    "superimposed on the density plots are gamma densities whose parameters are estimated by the method of moments .",
    "we are not advocating these gamma models for inference regarding quantiles , but rather we generate random samples from them to assist in assessing interval coverage for such data .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] we report the results for our reconstructed data .",
    "vst and ` stud ' refer to 95% interval estimators that we introduce soon in section [ subsec : dfcis ] based on variance stabilization and studentization respectively .",
    "as can be seen the studentized and vst intervals are identical to two decimal places which is due to the large sample sizes .",
    "it should be noted that the widths of the intervals are not so narrow so as to make the intervals redundant , but rather they are themselves informative when reported with the ratio point estimates .",
    "also shown are results for 10,000 simulation runs from gamma distributed data with parameters set to those used to overlay the densities in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "they indicate excellent coverage of the intervals when sampling from the fitted gamma distributions with approximately the same results for both methods .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the @xmath1% quantile from the standard normal distribution . a test of @xmath2 for the ratio p90/p10 against a significant difference would reject at level 0.05 when @xmath3 , where @xmath4=\\{\\se _ \\text{2005}^2+\\se _ \\text{2011}^2\\}^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath5=0.0105 $ ] and @xmath6=0.0088.$ ] now @xmath7 , so the p90/p10 ratios differ significantly for the years 2005 and 2011 .",
    "formalities are given in section  [ sec : twotest ] .",
    "let @xmath8 be a continuous distribution with positive domain . define the _ quantile function _ as the inverse @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath8 is understood , we often write @xmath11 for the @xmath12th quantile @xmath13 , which is also called the @xmath14th percentile . for any choices of @xmath15 in @xmath16 we are interested in the ratios",

    "however , the @xcite quantile estimator @xmath23 , which is a linear combination of two adjacent order statistics , generally has much less bias and similar variance , so in the sequel we estimate @xmath11 by @xmath23 .",
    "this estimator is type  8 of quantile estimators on the software package r , @xcite .",
    "given such a single sample , and fixed @xmath24 we estimate the ratio @xmath25 by @xmath26 .",
    "assuming @xmath8 has a positive and continuous derivative @xmath27 on its support , the derivative of the quantile function @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 ; this is the _ quantile density _ of @xcite , earlier called the _ sparsity index _ by @xcite .",
    "it arises in first order asymptotic covariance expressions , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.2 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.7 ) , where it is shown that as @xmath22 increases without bound @xmath30 ; and , for @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 means that lower order terms are omitted . for the case",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath31 a first - order approximation to the correlation between @xmath36 , @xmath37 is @xmath38 ; for @xmath34 it is @xmath39 this asymptotic correlation is notably free of @xmath8 and sample sizes , and must be taken into account in computing standard errors of @xmath40 the classical formula @xcite for the variance of a ratio of random variables , provided the denominator has positive support , is given in terms of means , variances and covariance of its components .",
    "we only consider @xmath8 with positive support , and thus when applied to sample quantile estimators with @xmath24 this formula for the ratio of variances can be written : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the quadratic with constants defined in terms of ( [ covxpxq ] ) by @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 note that @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 are free of scale and sample size .",
    "the quadratic @xmath49 for all @xmath50 because @xmath51 and its discriminant @xmath52 ; the latter inequality follows from @xmath53    these results suggest that the large sample variance of @xmath54 is approximately @xmath55 , and , because the large sample squared bias is of smaller order , the standard error can be approximated by @xmath56 this formula has been derived for _ known _ constants @xmath57 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . to make it distribution - free , one needs to replace @xmath58 by @xmath37 , @xmath59 by @xmath60 and @xmath61 by @xmath62 ; where @xmath63 is a quantile density estimate such as the kernel density estimator described in appendix  [ sec : qden ] .",
    "when this is done , we obtain the distribution - free standard error estimate @xmath64      we compare distribution - free large - sample confidence intervals for @xmath65 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath66 is asymptotically normal but quite skewed for moderate sample sizes , so transformations are employed to normalize its distribution and derive confidence intervals .",
    "this methodology is standard , so here we only present the final results for the log - transformation and a variance stabilizing transformation , with details given in section  [ sec : taylor ] .",
    "one traditional approach for finding confidence intervals of a ratio of statistics such as @xmath67 is to first find approximations to the asymptotic mean and variance of the estimated log - ratio @xmath68 , use the studentized version of this estimator to obtain a confidence interval for @xmath69 and then exponentiate this interval . in terms of earlier definitions ( [ covxpxq ] ) , the asymptotic mean and variance of @xmath70 are shown in appendix  [ sec : taylor ] to be : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given by ( [ asymvarrhohat ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic normality of @xmath73 then leads to the nominal 100@xmath74% confidence interval for @xmath50 : @xmath75_\\text{s } = \\widehat \\rho \\,\\left \\{\\exp \\left [ \\mp z_{1-\\alpha /2}\\,\\sqrt { { \\var } ( \\widehat \\theta ) } \\;\\right ] \\right \\}~.\\ ] ] to make the intervals ( [ scis ] ) distribution - free , the values of @xmath11 , @xmath58 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 appearing in @xmath79 need to be consistently estimated , and @xmath79 replaced by @xmath80 .",
    "it is also noted in appendix  [ sec : qden ] that the widths of these intervals behave like : @xmath81      let @xmath82 be the derivative of the quadratic @xmath83 defined in ( [ asymvarrhohat ] ) , and let @xmath84 be the negative of its discriminant .",
    "then as explained in appendix  [ sec : qden ] , one can derive large - sample nominal 100@xmath74% confidence intervals : @xmath85_\\text{v}=\\frac { 1}{2\\widehat a_2}\\left \\",

    "the hats appearing on @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 indicate that they are the result of distribution - free estimates of @xmath89 @xmath76 , @xmath78 etc .",
    "being replaced by consistent estimates .",
    "the asymptotic widths of these intervals are , up to first order , the same as those derived by the log - transformation ( [ widthscis ] ) . thus the large - sample coverage and widths of the two intervals @xmath90_\\text{s}$ ] and @xmath90_\\text{v}$ ]",
    "are the same ; so in section  [ sec : simulations ] we compare their finite sample properties .",
    "in this section we report simulated coverage probabilities and mean interval widths for several distributions .",
    "extensive simulations were carried out for the ln(0,1 ) , exp(1 ) , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , pareto(1 ) , pareto(1.5 ) and pareto(2 ) distributions . by pareto(@xmath94 )  we mean the type ii pareto distribution with shape parameter @xmath94 and distribution function @xmath95 for @xmath96 commands for generating data or finding quantiles from this distribution are obtained by downloading the package actuar on r. we report the results for three of these distributions and remark that similar results were obtained for the other distributions .      to ensure that the interval widths are considered in the correct context , in table [ table3 ] we provide the true quantile ratios for the distributions considered . in table",
    "[ table4 ] we report the simulated coverage probabilities ( cp ) and average widths ( @xmath97 ) for the interval estimators associated with the ln(0,1 ) , @xmath92 and the pareto(2 ) distributions for various choices or @xmath18 and @xmath12 and three sample sizes @xmath98 and 500 . in almost all cases ,",
    "the coverage probabilities are between 0.95 and 0.97 . in general , the vst intervals are slightly narrower than the studentized intervals and consequently slightly less conservative .",
    "this is consistent with the folkloric view amongst applied statisticians that variance stabilization generally leads to more powerful tests than studentization for moderate sample sizes ; a view recently reinforced by examples in @xcite , @xcite and theory in @xcite .    the results of table  [ table4 ]",
    "were restricted to the special case of @xmath99 for choices of @xmath100 .",
    "however , it will be useful to consider the coverage probabilities for a much wider choice of @xmath18 and @xmath12",
    ". we will now consider coverage probabilities for the vst and studentized intervals for two of the distributions .",
    "additionally , we use the log - normal qor only since the smaller computation cost means that we can use a large number of iterations over many choices of @xmath18 and @xmath12 .    as in @xcite , we use contour plots to assess coverage probability over a wider range of @xmath101 combinations . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot the simulated coverage probabilities based on 10,000 replications for all combinations of @xmath18 and @xmath12 from @xmath102 for data sampled from the logn(0 , 1 ) distribution .",
    "green indicates ideal coverage of between 0.95 and 0.96 ( e.g. at least nominal ) and light blue indicates slightly conservative intervals . when @xmath103 we can see that the intervals can be very conservative ( i.e. the dark blue regions ) when @xmath18 and @xmath12 are close together .",
    "however , such choices of @xmath18 and @xmath12 do not typically provide much insight since quantiles are approximately the same .",
    "for other choices of @xmath18 and @xmath12 the coverages are quite good , despite the small sample sizes of @xmath103 . typically , the vst interval is the marginally better performer with coverages slightly closer to the nominal level of 0.95 . as @xmath22",
    "is increased to 250 and then to 500 , we see that the coverage probabilities become even closer to nominal with a tendency for slightly conservative intervals . very rarely does the simulated coverage fall below the nominal coverage of 0.95 highlighting reliable performance for this distribution .    in figure [ fig3 ] are shown the simulated coverage probability contour plots for the pareto(2 ) distribution . in general , the intervals are slightly more conservative than they were for the log normal although lower than nominal coverage is very rare .",
    "again , @xmath104 results in the most conservative intervals , especially for smaller @xmath22 , although in practice this scenario is trivial , at best .",
    "coverage improves for increasing @xmath22 with most reported coverages between 0.95 and 0.97 when @xmath105 . in the next section",
    "we will see that further increases of the samples sizes continues to improve coverage .      in table",
    "[ table5 ] we report large sample size empirical probabilities and mean widths for the same intervals and distributions summarized in table  [ table4 ] , and one can see that the coverage probabilities are closer to nominal .",
    "further , the widths of the intervals are not so small as to justify the use of point estimates only .",
    "this is especially true for the pareto(2 ) distribution where even for @xmath106 the mean widths are still large relative to the ratio being estimated ; ( e.g. , @xmath107 , @xmath108 with @xmath109 and the mean interval width is 5.89 for both intervals ) .",
    "additional to the large sample simulations conducted above , we note that many samples of income data include a small percentage of zero values ( e.g. for households with zero income or households in debt rounded upwards to zero ) .",
    "we therefore examine the following mixture model :    @xmath110    where @xmath8 is the positive income distribution , @xmath111 is places all its mass at the point 0 and @xmath112 is the proportion of the mixture that are zeroes .    in table",
    "[ table6 ] we report simulation results for zeroes mixed with the logn(0,1 ) , @xmath92 and the pareto(2 ) distributions , respectively , with probabilities @xmath113 . for simplicity",
    "we report only the coverage probabilities and only for the vst intervals ; similar results are obtained for the studentized intervals .",
    "when @xmath114 we do not report results for any ratio estimating @xmath115 since approximately half of the estimates will equate to zero .",
    "overall the coverage probabilities are close to nominal with a tendency for conservative intervals when estimating @xmath115 . in this case a mass of zeroes lying close to one of the quantiles in the ratio will have a small effect on the estimated density in that vicinity .      for background material on robustness concepts such as influence functions and breakdown points ,",
    "see @xcite or @xcite .      extending on the zero mixture distribution from ,",
    "define the contamination   distribution which places positive probability @xmath116 on @xmath117 ( the contamination point ) and @xmath118 on the distribution @xmath8 .",
    "formally , it is defined for each @xmath119 by @xmath120 $ ] . the influence function for any functional @xmath121 is then defined for each @xmath117 as the @xmath122 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the reason for calculating this variance is that it arises in the asymptotic variance of the functional applied to the empirical distribution @xmath129 , namely @xmath130 ; that is , @xmath131=p(1-p)\\,g^2(p)$ ] ; and sometimes a simple expression for the asymptotic variance is not otherwise available .",
    "the influence function of the ratio of two quantiles @xmath132 is then by elementary calculus and ( [ ifquantile ] ) found to be @xmath133\\}\\,g(p)-                    x_{p}\\{q - i[x_{q}\\geq z]\\}\\,g(q)}{x_{q}^2}~.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when expanded in a power series expansion with respect to @xmath134 , we have that @xmath135 .",
    "consequently , it would be of interest to study the influence relative to @xmath136 since large values of @xmath137 are not suggestive of high sensitivity if the ratio at @xmath8 is very large .    to assess influence sensitivity relative to the size of the ratio at @xmath8 , in plot a of figure [ fig4 ]",
    "is shown @xmath138 for @xmath139 $ ] and @xmath140 and @xmath99 .",
    "as one can see , the influence increases quickly as @xmath18 approaches its boundaries when @xmath117 is close to zero .",
    "in this situation either @xmath11 or @xmath58 is close to zero and therefore close to the contamination . in plot",
    "b we vary both @xmath18 and @xmath12 but fix the contamination @xmath141 .",
    "again it can be seen that the ratio estimator is especially sensitive to zero valued observations when either @xmath18 or @xmath12 is close to 0 . in practice ,",
    "if a data set contains a mixture of zero valued observations together with positive values then inference will be difficult if either @xmath18 or @xmath12 is small . in section [ sec : simmix ]",
    "simulations revealed that even a small proportion of zeroes could result in over conservative intervals when @xmath18 or @xmath12 was equal to 0.05 .",
    "the influence function can also be used to calculate the asymptotic variance @xmath142=\\text{asv}(\\rho_{p , q};f)=\\e\\left[\\if ( z;\\,\\rho _ { p , q } , f)^2\\right]\\ ] ] by expanding and noting that for the two cases @xmath143 and @xmath144 we have @xmath145)i(x_{q}\\geq z])=i(x_{p}\\geq z])$ ] and @xmath145)i(x_{q}\\geq z])=i(x_{q}\\geq z])$ ] respectively .",
    "this gives @xmath146\\label{asv}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 when @xmath148 and @xmath149 when @xmath150 .",
    "it can be verified that this expression for the asymptotic variance is equal to .",
    "also , for the special case @xmath151 we have simply @xmath152 ^ 2\\label{asv2}\\ ] ] we assess the variability of the ratio estimator with respect to the magnitude of the ratio to be estimated .",
    "therefore , in figure [ fig5 ] we plot @xmath153 for @xmath18 in @xmath154 ( plot b ) .",
    "these plots show that the variance of the ratio estimator can be very large ( relative the population ratio squared ) when either @xmath18 and @xmath12 is close to zero . in practice",
    ", one needs to be aware that ratios involving very small quantiles will have higher variability and wider intervals relative to the magnitude of the ratio will result .      the asymptotic breakdown point @xmath155 of a functional @xmath121 is roughly speaking the minimum proportion of contamination of @xmath8 to @xmath156 that can render useless @xmath157 , as @xmath117 varies over the support of @xmath8 .",
    "this @xmath158 is often free of @xmath8 and gives an indication of how sensitive the functional @xmath121 and its estimator @xmath159 are to possible contamination .",
    "unfortunately , rigorous definitions and mathematical arguments for finding such breakdown points are often complicated , see @xcite and references therein . here",
    "we give a somewhat heuristic derivation of the breakdown point for the functional @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath8 is continuous and strictly increasing on @xmath162 .",
    "it is well known and intuitively clear that the breakdown point of @xmath163 itself is @xmath164 this is because if @xmath165 one can move the @xmath18th quantile of @xmath166 to 0 by choice of @xmath117 and if @xmath167 one can make it move towards @xmath168 and for any @xmath169 the contamination can not move @xmath166 to one of its boundaries .",
    "the functional @xmath170 is more complicated , and breaks down  if either @xmath171 or @xmath172 breaks down , ( because then the ratio is @xmath173 or undefined ) , and hence uninformative .",
    "it also breaks down if @xmath174 ( because then the ratio is 1 , another uninformative value ) ; and this can be arranged if and only if @xmath175 by taking @xmath176 . putting these facts together ,",
    "the breakdown point for the ratio of quantiles equals @xmath177 .",
    "this breakdown point is clearly maximized by taking @xmath178 or @xmath179",
    "while point estimators of the ratio of percentiles from a single sample are commonplace , accompanying standard errors and/or interval estimators of such ratios are now possible .",
    "we have shown that such procedures are necessary because what are usually considered large samples do not by any means guarantee that variability is negligible in the ratio estimates .",
    "we compared two interval estimators of the quantile ratios , one based on the studentized log - transformation , and the other on variance stabilization .",
    "while asymptotically equivalent , simulations showed that the coverage of the vst intervals was slightly better than the log intervals , although both are somewhat conservative for moderate sample sizes .",
    "however , the log - transformed ratios are more amenable to computing two - sample tests from independent samples , as described in [ sec : twotest ]",
    ".    one may be able to reduce the conservative coverage of both intervals by using a bias correction ; for example by subtracting an estimate of the bias in @xmath180 , see equation ( [ asymmeanthetahat ] ) .",
    "however , we tried this and other bias correction methods for the variance - stabilized estimate ratio , to no avail",
    ". finally , it may well be possible to choose sample sizes to achieve a desired relative width in the confidence intervals over a large class of distributions .",

    "also , we will truncate the income data to the interval @xmath181 $ ] for two reasons : first , to obtain a sample from a continuous data set by excluding the positive mass at 0 ; and second because the largest category 2000 or more  is unbounded .",
    "our reconstructed sample for 2005 has size @xmath182 and similarly for 2011 it is 13904 .      in what follows",

    "further , we need @xmath186\\doteq \\ln ( \\e[u])\\,\\ln ( \\e[v])+\\frac { \\cov[u , v]}{\\e[u]\\,\\e[v ] } -\\frac { \\ln ( \\e[v])\\,\\var [ u]}{2\\e^2[u ] } -\\frac { \\ln ( \\e[u])\\,\\var [ v]}{2\\e^2[v]}~.\\ ] ] combining the above formulae , the approximate variance of @xmath187 is @xmath188\\doteq \\frac { \\var [ u ] } { \\e^2[u]}+ \\frac { \\var [ v ] } { \\e^2[v]}-\\frac { 2\\cov [ u , v]}{\\e[u]\\,\\e[v ] } ~.\\ ] ] applying these approximations to @xmath189 and @xmath190 yields ( [ asymmeanthetahat ] ) and ( [ asymvarthetahat ] ) . by the delta theorem , @xcite , @xmath191}$ ]",
    "converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution , so a large sample 100@xmath192% confidence interval for @xmath69 is given by @xmath193}\\;.$ ] this leads immediately to the interval ( [ scis ] ) having the same confidence for @xmath194 . by expanding the exponentials appearing in ( [ scis ] ) in series",
    ", it is found that the widths of these intervals @xmath195 can be expressed in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath196 $ ] as shown in ( [ widthscis ] ) .",
    "the confidence intervals described previously ( [ scis ] ) and ( [ vstcis ] ) require estimates of @xmath57 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 appearing in the asymptotic variance quadratic ( [ asymvarrhohat ] ) , which require estimates of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 defined in ( [ covxpxq ] ) ; and these in turn require estimates of the quantile densities @xmath59 and @xmath61 . there have been many contributors to this problem and we refer the reader to @xcite for background and results on kernel density estimators of the form @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a bandwidth and @xmath199 for some kernel function @xmath200 which is an even function on @xmath201 $ ] .",
    "we follow @xcite in using the epanechnikov kernel with an estimated optimal bandwidth .",
    "the optimal bandwidth depends on the quantile optimality ratio qor@xmath202 and the qor for an assumed underlying log - normal distribution can be used for many unimodal distributions supported on the half - infinite interval @xmath203 ; a boundary correction is included for quantiles near 0 .",
    "alternatively , one can calculate the qor assuming that the underlying density can be well - approximated by the highly flexible generalized lambda distribution ( gld ) , see section  [ sec : gld ] .",
    "the intervals ( [ vstcis ] ) are derived exactly as for the quantile - based skewness coefficients in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.3 ) and displayed in equation  9 of that paper .",
    "one only needs to replace the coefficients in the quadratic defining the asymptotic variance by the simpler ones needed here ( [ asymvarrhohat ] ) .",
    "it is also shown there that the width @xmath204 can be expressed @xmath205 .",
    "the leading term of this expression is exactly equal to that in ( [ widthscis ] ) , which is the asymptotic width for the interval @xmath206 based on studentization .      gld qor identifies another approach when the underlying distribution is assumed to be at least close to a member of the highly - flexible generalized lambda distribution . for more on the estimation of the quantile density see appendix [ sec : qden ] and @xcite . in general , the vst intervals are slightly narrower than the studentized intervals and consequently slightly less conservative .",
    "additionally , there may be some small gain to using the gld qor , in particular when the distribution is not the log - normal .",
    "however , the log - normal qor provides a good bandwidth and is easier to compute .",
    "given that there were 10,000 iterations used in the simulations , we used method of moments estimators for the gld distribution which were comparatively quick to compute .",
    "there are various other gld estimators available .",
    "the r packages ` gld ` and ` gldex ` @xcite provide various gld estimators .",
    "however , some small improvements may results when using the gld qor as seen in table [ table8 ] . using the parameterisation of (",
    "* fkml parameterisation ) , some small improvements may be achieved although requiring the estimation of four parameters increases the computational complexity .",
    "the theory supporting the studentized log - transformed ratios can also be extended to consider the difference between two independent log - transformed ratio estimators . for simplicity",
    "we will assume that the same @xmath18 and @xmath12 are used for each of the estimators although this is technically not required .",
    "let @xmath207 and @xmath208 be estimates of the percentile ratios @xmath209 and @xmath210 respectively .",
    "further , let @xmath211 and @xmath212 where the asymptotic variances , @xmath213 and @xmath213 , for each can be obtained from . then a large sample @xmath214% confidence interval for @xmath215 is @xmath216 or , for @xmath217 to be interpreted on a ratio scale , @xmath218\\right \\}\\label{ci_diff2}.\\ ] ]    the good empirical coverage probabilities for the interval estimates of a single ratio suggest good approximations for the standard error which in turn suggest good coverage is achievable when considering two independent ratios .",
    "we provide some brief verification here via simulation and note that these coverage probability results are for both of the interval estimators in and which are equivalent in this regard .",
    "empirical coverage probabilities computed over 10,000 simulation runs are reported in table [ table9 ] .",
    "the samples sizes were @xmath22 and @xmath219 for each of the two groups with data sampled from the ln(0,1 ) and ln(0.2,1.5 ) distributions respectively .",
    "while slightly conservative , for each of the differences in percentile ratios considered for this simulation , the coverage does not drop below the nominal level of 0.95 .",
