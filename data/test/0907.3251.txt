    "as the paradigmatic discrete - time realization of brownian motion and diffusive processes , whose theory was formulated in the pioneering work by einstein  @xcite and smoluchowski  @xcite published in beginning of the last century , random walks have received a considerable amount of attention  @xcite , uncovering their wide range of distinct applications . thus far , random walks are still an active area of research  @xcite . however , due to the complexity and variety of real media , theory of random walks on general graphs ( networks ) is not yet available .",
    "for this reason , studying random walks occurring on simple structures is a matter of exceptional importance .",
    "fractal structures , in particular deterministic fractals , are valuable media in this content  @xcite , because their properties can be exactly studied .    among various deterministic fractals  @xcite , the t - fractal ( t - graph )",
    "@xcite is a typical candidate for exactly solvable model , and a plethora of issues for random walks on this fractal have been studied  @xcite .",
    "a simple analytical approach was proposed in  @xcite , showing that random walks on the t - graph can be mapped onto diffusion on a comb structure .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the moments of the first - passage time and survival probability for random walks on the t - graph was computed in  @xcite .",
    "particularly , random walks performed on the t - graph with a single trap were extensively studied by many groups  @xcite , revealing some scaling relations and dominating behavior .",
    "despite the fact that these investigations uncovered many unusual and exotic features of the t - graph , providing useful insight into understanding random walks on this fractal , they did not give a complete picture of random - walk dynamics on the t - fractal , since in these studies , only one special trap was considered .",
    "it was shown that in some real networks , any node may be looked as a trap , and the location of traps strongly affects the behavior of random walks  @xcite .",
    "irrespective of its obvious importance and ubiquity , this issue has not been addressed for the t - graph .    in this paper , using the connection between the random walks and electrical networks  @xcite , we investigate random walks on the t - graph .",
    "the random walk process addressed here may be considered as the trapping problem with the perfect trap uniformly located at all nodes .",
    "we derive analytically an exact formula for the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) averaged all pairs of nodes , which characterizes the efficiency of random walks on the t - graph .",
    "we show that the location of trap has no qualitative effect on the scaling for mfpt .",
    "we expect that our analytical method can be applied to some other deterministic media , and that our results can lead to deeper insights to random walks on the t - graph .",
    "the t - graph is built in an iterative way  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) the t - graph after @xmath2 iterations .",
    "note that henceforth we will also call the number of iterations as generation of the t - graph . the construction of the t - graph starts from ( @xmath3 ) two nodes connected by an edge , which corresponds to @xmath4 . for @xmath5 , @xmath0",
    "is obtained from @xmath6 by performing the operation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cons ] . according to the construction algorithm , at each generation , the number of edges in the system increases by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we can easily obtain that at generation @xmath2 , the total number of edges in @xmath0 is @xmath8 . since the t - graph is a tree ,",
    "the total number of nodes in @xmath0 is @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ net ] shows schematically the structure of @xmath10 .        the t - graph is a fractal with the fractal dimension and random walk dimension being @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the spectral dimension of the t - graph is @xmath13 .",
    "note that for a general connected graph , the spectral dimension governs the longtime behavior of a random walk on the graph at a deep level .",
    "for example , when a walker originating at a given node @xmath14 of the graph , the probability @xmath15 for returning back to @xmath14 , at long time @xmath16 , obeys the relation",
    "@xmath17  @xcite .",
    "again for instance , for an infinite graph with the spectral dimension @xmath18 , a walker starting from a given node will return back to the node almost surely over the course of time .",
    "the phenomenon of a random walk on such a graph is called  persistence \" .",
    "since the spectral dimension @xmath19 for the t - graph , a random walk on such a graph is persistent .    to facilitate the description in what follows",
    ", we define the central node in fig .",
    "[ net ] as the innermost node , and we call those nodes farthest from the central node as outermost nodes . then , the t - graph can be alteratively constructed in another method , see fig .",
    "[ copy ] . given the generation @xmath2 , @xmath20 may be obtained by joining three copies of @xmath0 , denoted as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "in other words , to get @xmath20 one can merge together separate outermost nodes of the three replicas of @xmath0 . in the process of joining ,",
    "the three outermost nodes are emerged into a single new node , which becomes the innermost node of @xmath20 .    , which is obtained by joining three copies of @xmath0 , consecutively represented as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "in this section , we investigate a minimal model for discrete - time random walks of a particle on the t - graph @xmath0 . at each time step",
    ", the walker moves from its current location to any of its nearest neighbors with equal probability .",
    "a key quantity characterizing such a random walk is the first - passage time ( fpt ) , in terms of which many other quantities can be expressed .",
    "we are interested in the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) between two distinct nodes , averaged over all pairs .",
    "it is well - known that the random walks addressed here can be described by the processes of markov chains  @xcite , the fundamental matrices corresponding to which can be used to express the fpt between any pair of nodes .",
    "however , the fundamental matrix method for computing the mfpt in @xmath0 requires computing the inversion of @xmath24 matrices of size @xmath25 , making it prohibitively difficult to calculate the quantity concerned for all but small networks .    to bring down the high computational demands the fundamental matrix method makes",
    ", one can apply the method of the pseudoinverse of the laplacian matrix  @xcite for the graph @xmath0 that random walks are performed on , which allows to compute the fpt between two arbitrary nodes directly from the network topology and requires inversion of a single @xmath26 matrix .",
    "the elements @xmath27 of the laplacian matrix @xmath28 for graph @xmath0 are defined as follows : @xmath29 if the pair of two different nodes @xmath14 and @xmath30 is connected by a link , otherwise @xmath31 ; while @xmath32 ( i.e. , degree of node @xmath14 ) .",
    "then , the pseudoinverse of the laplacian matrix @xmath28 is  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35-dimensional  one \" vector , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the fpt for a walker in the t - graph @xmath0 , starting from node @xmath14 , to arrive at node @xmath30 for the first time .",
    "since the graph @xmath0 is connected , the pseudoinverse matrix @xmath38 is well defined and the entries @xmath39 can be applied to express the fpt @xmath37 as follows  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 entry of the diagonal of the laplacian matrix @xmath28 as defined above . then the sum , @xmath43 , for the fpt between two nodes over all node pairs in graph @xmath0 reads @xmath44 and the mfpt , @xmath45 , is @xmath46    the quantity of mfpt @xmath45 is very important since it measures the efficiency of the random walks on @xmath0 : the smaller the value @xmath45 , the higher the efficiency , and vice versa",
    ". equations  ( [ hitting01 ] ) and ( [ hitting03 ] ) show that the problem of calculating @xmath47 is reduced to determining the elements of the pseudoinverse matrix @xmath38 , whose complexity is that of inverting an @xmath48 matrix , it can be easily obtained by utilizing a standard software package , mathematica 5.0 .",
    "however , since @xmath35 increases exponentially with @xmath2 , for large @xmath2 , it becomes difficult to obtain @xmath45 through direct calculation using the pseudoinverse matrix , because of the limitations of time and computer memory .",
    "therefore , one can compute directly the mfpt only for the first generations , see fig .",
    "fortunately , the particular construction of the t - graph and the connection  @xcite between effective resistance and first - passage time allow us to calculate analytically the mfpt to obtain an explicit formula .",
    "details will be given below .",
    "( color online ) mean first - passage time @xmath45 as a function of the iteration @xmath2 on a semilogarithmic scale . the red squares are the numerical results obtained by direct calculation from eqs .",
    "( [ hitting01 ] ) and ( [ hitting03 ] ) , while the full blue squares represent the exact values from eq .",
    "( [ hitting07 ] ) , both of which agree with each other . ]",
    "in the following text , we will use the connection between the electrical networks and random walks to derive the closed - form expression for mfpt @xmath45 , avoiding the computation process for inverting any matrix .      given a graph ,",
    "the underlying electrical network  @xcite can be obtained by replacing each edge of the original graph with a unit resistor .",
    "the effective resistance between any node pair @xmath14 and @xmath30 is defined as the voltage when a unit current enters one node and leaves the other .",
    "it has been proved that the effective resistance is a distance measure , so the quantity is also called resistance distance  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can view @xmath0 as a resistor network by considering all edges of @xmath0 to be unit resistors .",
    "previous work  @xcite showed that many problems on a resistor network are closed related to the classic random walks on the original graph .",
    "for example , the computation of effective resistance between two nodes in a resistor network can be expressed by the fpt between the two nodes on the corresponding network : for an arbitrary connected graph , the effective resistance @xmath49 between a pair of nodes @xmath14 and @xmath30 is equal to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the total number of edges in the graph , and @xmath52 is the expected time for a walker starting at node @xmath14 to first reach @xmath30 . in fact",
    ", @xmath53 is the average time that a walker , originating at node @xmath14 , will take to hit node @xmath30 and go back to @xmath14 , and it is often called commute time  @xcite between @xmath14 and @xmath30 denoted as @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 .    according to the close relation between commute time and effective resistance , we have that for @xmath0 , the effective resistance @xmath56 between a pair of nodes @xmath14 and @xmath30 is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the commute time between @xmath14 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath59 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ hitting02 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath60 and eq .",
    "( [ hitting03 ] ) can be recast as @xmath61 equation  ( [ hitting05 ] ) shows that if we know how to determine the effective resistances , then we have the way to find the mfpt .    for a general graph with order @xmath62 ,",
    "the complexity of resistance computation is that of inverting an @xmath63 matrix , identical to that of calculating mfpt .",
    "however , for a treelike graph , the effective resistance between two nodes is exactly the usual shortest - path distance ( also called geodesic distance ) between the corresponding nodes .",
    "since the t - graph has a treelike structure and it is self - similar at the same time , we can use these properties to find its geodesic distance , obtaining a rigorous expression .",
    "after reducing the determination of mfpt to finding the average geodesic distance , the next step is to explicitly determine the latter quantity . to this end",
    ", we represent all the shortest - path distance of @xmath0 as a matrix  @xcite , where the entry @xmath64 is the shortest distance from node @xmath14 to node @xmath30 , which is the minimum length for the path connecting the two nodes .",
    "the maximum value @xmath65 of @xmath64 is called the diameter of @xmath0 .",
    "then , the average geodesic distance of @xmath0 is defined as the mean of shortest - path distances over all pairs of nodes : @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the sum of the geodesic distances between two nodes over all pairs .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ total01 ] ) , for two nodes @xmath14 and @xmath30 ( @xmath68 ) , we only count @xmath64 or @xmath69 , not both .    we continue by exhibiting the procedure of the determination of the total shortest - path distance and present the recurrence formula , which allows us to obtain @xmath70 of the @xmath71 generation from @xmath72 of the @xmath2 generation .",
    "according to the second construction method , we can easily see that the t - graph is self - similar .",
    "this obvious self - similar structure allows to calculate @xmath73 analytically .",
    "it is not difficult to find that the total shortest - path distance @xmath70 satisfies the recursion relation@xmath74 where @xmath75 is the sum over all shortest - path distances whose end - points are not in the same @xmath0 branch .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ total02 ] ) is @xmath76.\\ ] ] thus , all that is left to obtain @xmath73 is to compute @xmath77 .",
    "the paths that contribute to @xmath75 must all go through the innermost node ( e.g. , @xmath78 in fig .  [ copy ] ) of @xmath20 .",
    "to find @xmath75 , we denote @xmath79 as the sum of all shortest paths with end - points in @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath79 rules out the paths where end - point is the node shared by @xmath80 and @xmath81 . by symmetry , @xmath82 .",
    "then , the total sum @xmath75 is given by @xmath83    in order to calculate the path length @xmath84 , we give the following notation .",
    "let @xmath85 be the geodesic distance of a outermost node of @xmath0  @xcite , which is defined as the sum of geodesic distances between the outermost node and all nodes of @xmath0 , including the outermost node itself .",
    "prior to determining @xmath85 , we first compute the diameter @xmath65 of @xmath0 . actually , the diameter @xmath65 is equal to the path length between arbitrary pair of the outermost nodes previously belong to two different @xmath86 branches .",
    "obviously , the following recursive relation holds : @xmath87 considering the initial condition @xmath88 , eq .",
    "( [ diam01 ] ) is solved inductively to obtain @xmath89    we now calculate the quantity @xmath90 .",

    "inserting eq .",

    "( [ cross01 ] ) , we have @xmath106 substituting eq .",
    "( [ cross04 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ total03 ] ) and using the initial value @xmath107 , we can obtain the exact expression for the total distance @xmath108 then the analytic expression for mean geodesic distance can be obtained as @xmath109    since for @xmath0 , the shortest - path distance is equivalent to the resistance distance , i.e. , @xmath110 , according to the above obtained results shown in eqs .",
    "( [ sg ] ) and  ( [ apl02 ] ) , we can easily get that the total of fpt between all @xmath111 pairs of nodes and the mfpt are @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "we have checked our analytical formula against numerical values , see fig .  [ time ] . for the range of @xmath114 , the values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ hitting07 ] ) are in complete agreement with those numerical results on the basis of the direct calculation through the method of pseudoinverse matrix discussed in section  [ sec03 ] .",
    "this agreement serves as an independent test of our theoretical formula .",
    "note that the result provided in eq .",
    "( [ hitting07 ] ) is consistent with the recent proposal by condamin _",

    "_ , one has @xmath120 as found in eq .",
    "( [ hitting07 ] ) .",
    "next we will express the mfpt @xmath45 as a function of network order @xmath35 , in order to obtain the scaling between these two quantities . from the relation @xmath121",
    ", we have @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "thereby , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ hitting07 ] ) as @xmath124 which provides explicit dependence of @xmath45 on network order @xmath35 . in the infinite network order , namely @xmath125 , @xmath126 thus , for the large t - graph , the mfpt grows as a power law function of network order with the exponent larger than 1 and less than 2 , implying that the mfpt increases superlinearly with the number of network nodes .",
    "equation  ( [ hitting09 ] ) encodes the speed of the random walks on @xmath0 , which may be quantified by the coverage @xmath127 , standing for the mean number of different nodes visited by a walker at time @xmath16 , averaged for distinct walks initially starting from different sources  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath128 , the leading asymptotic behavior for @xmath127 is @xmath129 which may be established from the following heuristic argument  @xcite . since the random walker will visit all nodes of @xmath0 with probability one in the longtime limit , irrespective of its starting location , @xmath35 plays the role of @xmath127 , and @xmath45 is like @xmath16 ( step number of the walker ) .",
    "then , inverting the relation in eq .",
    "( [ coverage01 ] ) leads to asymptotic scaling @xmath130 , as found above and given by eq .",
    "( [ hitting09 ] ) , which also provides the exact coefficient of proportionality .",
    "notice that in ref .",
    "@xcite agliari studied the trapping problem with an immobile trap located at the innermost ( central ) node , and showed that in the asymptotic limit , the average trapping time ( att ) to first reach the trap , averaged over all nodes except the absorbing node itself , exhibiting a similar behavior ( the same exponent ) as that of eq .",
    "( [ hitting09 ] ) , but has a different prefactor . note that , due to the symmetry , the att in this case corresponds to the mean time for random walks with a fixed trap situated at an outmost node in the t - graph of generation @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "that is to say , random walks of these two extreme cases show almost the same behavior of att . on the other hand ,",
    "the random walks discussed here may be considered as the trapping issue with the trap uniformly distributed throughout all nodes on the t - graph .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the trap s location has no qualitative impact on the leading behavior of the att for random walks on the t - graph , which is in sharp contrast to trapping problem on some scale - free networks  @xcite , where the att depends on the trap position : it is much smaller for the case when trap is located at a large - degree node than that for the case when the trap is uniformly placed .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the standard discrete - time random walks on the t - graph . by making use of the link between the electric networks and random walks ,",
    "we have studied analytically the mfpt averaged over all pairs of nodes , based on the recursive relations derived from the self - similar structure of the t - graph .",
    "we have determined the rigorous solution for the mfpt , which in the large limit of graph order , increases algebraically with the number of nodes .",
    "we showed that trap location has little influence on the scaling of mfpt for random walks on the t - graph .",
    "we expect that by providing a paradigm for computing the mfpt , our analytical technique could guide and shed light on related studies of random walks on other deterministic media , especially to some scale - free fractals  @xcite that has received much recent contention  @xcite .",
    "we also expect that our work , especially the exact solution , could prompt the studies of diffusion process on random fractals , other stochastic graphs , and even complex networks  @xcite , by giving a guide to and a test of approximate methods for random media .",
