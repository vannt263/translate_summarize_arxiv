    "liquid argon ( lar ) detectors have been widely used during recent years in several fields ranging from neutrino physics @xcite to direct dark matter searches @xcite . in particular a massive liquid argon time projection chamber ( lar - tpc ) is the preferred option for the next generation of underground neutrino observatories recently proposed @xcite , given its particle identification and low energy threshold capabilities in large active volumes @xcite .",
    "particle interactions in argon produce simultaneous excitation and ionization of the atoms , generating , at the same time , vuv photons and ion / electron pairs . in a typical lar - tpc ,",
    "photon sensors are used to detect the prompt scintillation light , while a constant electric field @xmath0 drifts the electrons to the anode .",
    "the charge readout can be carried out through the collection of the electrons on thin wires placed directly in the liquid @xcite or , for double phase liquid - vapor detectors , through their extraction to a gas region placed above the sensitive volume @xcite . in this case",
    ", a townsend avalanche can be induced through high electric fields , producing an amplified signal proportional to the number of primary electrons extracted from the liquid phase .",
    "a direct charge readout with the wires in a single phase chamber has the advantage of an overall simplified detector design .",
    "however experiments foreseeing drift up to 20 m have been recently proposed @xcite , which require a considerable technological effort to mantain a level of contamination less than 60 ppt of o@xmath1 equivalent @xcite ( electron half life @xmath2 5 ms @xcite ) , in order to reduce the impact of the electron quenching by electronegative impurities contaminating the lar bulk .",
    "the amplification in the gas phase makes it possible to detect smaller charge signals , thus allowing it to reach a lower energy threshold or , equivalently , to foresee a longer drift distance with respect to the single phase design .",
    "the positive and negative charges , produced by the particle interactions in the liquid , drift to the cathode and the anode following the same field lines , although the former have a drift speed which is six orders of magnitude lower than the latter ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . as a consequence , the ions spend more time in the liquid before they get collected on the cathode and neutralized , and the positive charge density is much larger than that of the electrons ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this effect can be particularly relevant for double - phase detectors foreseeing large charge amplification factors , where the ions , created in the vapor volume , may drift back to the cathode crossing the gas - liquid interface and increase the @xmath5 in the liquid .",
    "the space charge can locally modify the amplitude of the electric field , the drift lines and the velocity of the electrons produced in the liquid , leading to a displacement in the reconstructed position of the ionization signal .",
    "additionally , the positive density @xmath5 can be sizable such that the probability of a  secondary electron / ion recombination \" , different than the primary columnar recombination , has to be considered between the charge signal produced in the liquid and the ion current .",
    "the effect can cause an additional signal loss , with a probability dependent on the electron drift path , that could resemble the charge quenching given by the electronegative impurities in the active volume .",
    "the dynamics of the positive charge density produced by the cosmic rays and by the @xmath6 contamination in natural argon has been investigated in the present article , evaluating its impact on the electron signal in massive argon detectors .",
    "the study is particularly relevant for the new generation of neutrino experiments foreseeing drift paths of many meters .",
    "in a double phase detector , the primary electrons produced in the liquid drift to the gas region where they are extracted and accelerated with the production of a townsend avalanche . at the same time , given low diffusion of the ions in gas argon relative to the typical size of the amplification region , a non - negligible fraction of the ar ions produced by the avalanche can drift back to the liquid interface along the same field lines of the extracted electrons . when the distance between the ion and the liquid - vapor interface is greater than several angstroms , the liquid can be treated as a continuum , thus an approximated description of the dynamics can be obtained solving a boundary condition problem between different dielectrics with the mirror charge method in a single dimension @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a point like charge @xmath7 in a medium with permittivity @xmath8 , placed near the interface with another medium with permittivity @xmath9 , produces a mirror charge @xmath10 . taking into account that the relative permittivity is @xmath11 for liquid argon and @xmath12 for argon vapor , the corresponding potential energy for an ion placed at a distance @xmath13 from the liquid - vapor interface is a function of the inverse of the distance from the surface @xcite : @xmath14    and it is depicted in fig .  [ pot_e_ion ] , where the integration constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 account for the potential energy of the ion when it is far from the interface ( see the eq .",
    "[ energy_ion ] ) .",
    "classically , the potential is infinite at @xmath17 , thus it has been sometimes assumed that the barrier can preclude the ions from reaching the liquid phase @xcite , although that is true only if the charge can be approximated as point - like . considering dimensions of the order of 1   , as it is the case for the ionized atomic or molecular states whose formation is typical in noble gases @xcite , the mirror approximation is no longer valid .",
    "as the ion approaches the interface , it induces a displacement of the charge in the liquid that reduces the potential energy . the effective potential should decrease monotonically as the ion plunges into the liquid , following a sigmoidal shape ( dashed line , fig .",
    "[ pot_e_ion ] ) , thus the problem is reduced to a finite classical potential barrier .",
    "     at the same time , the crossing of the liquid - gas interface is energetically favored .",
    "considering the ion as a uniformly charged sphere of radius @xmath18 , its potential energy far from the surface can be expressed as : @xmath19    taking into account that @xmath18 is of the order of @xmath20  , the @xmath21  ev difference between the potential energies at the interface allows the injection of the ions into the liquid , thus the possibility that a large fraction of the positive charge produced in the gas phase enters the liquid can not be discarded .",
    "for the present study it is irrelevant what kind of charge amplification device is used : we introduce the ion gain @xmath22 defined as the number of positive ions injected into the liquid for each electron extracted .",
    "this factor is proportional to the electron amplification @xmath23 through a constant @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) which takes into account the average loss of the positive charge in the gas , given by the ions scattering onto field lines not ending on the liquid surface depends on the geometry and the field configuration of the charge amplifying device . ] , as well as the efficiency to pass the liquid - gas interface . if the amplification factor @xmath22 is large enough , the positive charge density @xmath26 in the liquid can be widely increased by the secondary ions produced by the avalanche .",
    "we consider a lar - tpc with an axial geometry and the @xmath27 axis perpendicular to the surface of the liquid .",
    "the drift field @xmath0 in the liquid is along @xmath27 , with the anode at the origin ( @xmath28 ) and the cathode at a positive distance @xmath29 . in the following calculation",
    "we assume that the detector is wide enough such that the transverse coordinate is not relevant for the discussion and @xmath0 is constant in any transverse section of the detector .    in the limit of a null ion",
    "current , the drift field is constant and it is equal to the cathode voltage divided by the total drift length @xmath29 . on the contrary ,",
    "the ion cloud makes the drift field to change with @xmath27 , and it is minimum at the anode and maximum at the cathode . the cathode voltage necessary to obtain a given field has to take into account the ion current , and it can be calculated integrating the drift field expression as a function of @xmath27 .    additionally , the possibility has to be considered that an ion recombines along the drift with a free electron produced by the interactions in the liquid , causing a quenching effect of the charge signal similar to the one given by the electronegative impurities . in order to evaluate the probability of that  secondary \" recombination , different than the primary columnar recombination",
