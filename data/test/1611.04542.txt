    "subsequently , deutsch and jozsa @xcite , bernstein and vazirani @xcite and simon @xcite demonstrated the striking difference between the classical and quantum query complexity .",
    "this culminated with grover s search algorithm @xcite achieving a quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm for the unstructured search problem along with shor s factoring algorithm @xcite that could factor integers efficiently and also calculate discrete logarithms .",
    "grover s algorithm gives an optimal solution to the unstructured search problem , the problem of deciding whether a black - box boolean function has any input that evaluates to 1 .",

    "however , adiabatic quantum computation @xcite provides a continuous time model for quantum computing by using the quantum adiabatic theorem . here",
    ", one begins by finding an appropriate hamiltonian whose ground state describes the solution to the problem of interest .",
    "next , a system with a simple hamiltonian is prepared and initialized to the ground state .",
    "finally , the simple hamiltonian is adiabatically evolved to the desired hamiltonian . by the quantum adiabatic theorem ,",
    "the system remains in the ground state at all times during this adiabatic evolution , depending on the spectral properties of the hamiltonian @xcite@xcite . at the end",
    ", the final state of the system describes the solution to the problem .",
    "the time complexity for an adiabatic algorithm is simply defined as the time taken to complete the adiabatic evolution , which is known to depend on the spectral gap of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic model of quantum computing is universal and equivalent to standard quantum computation @xcite .",
    "farhi and gutmann were the first to construct an analog algorithm for solving the grover search problem @xcite referred to hereafter as the _ analog analogue of grover search algorithm _ or simply the _ analog grover search algorithm_.    it is understood that the speedup in quantum algorithms comes from quantum mechanical features like quantum coherence and quantum correlations like quantum entanglement , that exist amongst the qubits .",
    "quantum correlations , especially quantum entanglement , is one of the crucial resources in quantum information theory and has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the indispensable role of entanglement in quantum information processing tasks such as quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and remote state preparation @xcite @xcite , etc . has been quantified and understood deeply . however , despite showing that quantum entanglement is _ necessary _ for the pure state implementation of grover search @xcite @xcite and shor s factoring algorithm @xcite , the innate role of entanglement is not clear for general quantum computing tasks .",
    "one of the fundamental attributes of quantum systems is their ability to exist in linear superpositions of different physical states .",

    "a ` coherence measure ' is a real - valued function over the quantum state - space , such that it vanishes for all the states that are deemed to be incoherent and can not increase under some class of operations that preserve incoherence .    in this paper , we quantitatively analyze the role of quantum coherence and monogamy of entanglement @xcite @xcite in the discrete analogue of the analog grover search algorithm . to quantify the dynamics of coherence in this analog grover search",

    "we use an entanglement monotone called the concurrence  @xcite to study the same .",
    "we find that the amount of coherence ( as quantified by the coherence measures ) is non - zero at all times during the search .",
    "the only time this coherence goes to zero is when the search algorithm attains the maximum success probability equal to one .",
    "since we begin with a maximally coherent state , in a resource theoretic sense , @xmath0-maximal coherence is actually consumed during the quantum search .",
    "using coherence monotones , we relate the success probability of the search algorithm with the amount of coherence .",
    "further , during the analog search , the final state is a product state and so all entanglement monotones must go to zero at the end of the search algorithm .",
    "the bipartite entanglement entropy , concurrence and the monogamy score , all behave in accord with this , since for both qubit partitions , these measures of quantum correlations go to zero and mark the completion of the search algorithm . furthermore",

    "adiabatic quantum computation can be described as a controlled hamiltonian evolution of a system obeying the schrdinger equation @xmath2 we briefly recapitulate the analog analogue of grover search algorithm  @xcite , where the problem is to use quantum evolution to find a marked state among @xmath3 orthonormal states .",

    "this analog model has been generalized further .",

    "our results will also hold in these generalized models .",
    "quantum coherence is one of the salient features of the quantum world . as this crucial",
    "feature drives several quantum technologies , it is very desirable to quantify the usefulness of coherence as a resource",
    ". this is done using the mathematical framework called a ` resource theory ' . to characterize something as a resource",
    ", we must first impose certain constraints on what specific physical operations are allowed ( e.g. the local operations and classical communication(locc ) framework for quantum entanglement @xcite restricts one from performing joint quantum operations between distant laboratories ) , which define the freely accessible operations . to be able to execute general quantum operations under such a constraint then requires some `` special '' quantum states that contain a relevant resource ( e.g. entangled states ) and can be consumed in the process .",
    "in fact , a quantitative resource theory for entanglement is already in place @xcite @xcite and has later expanded to encompass a wider range of operational phenomenon @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , for a long time there did not exist a resource theoretic framework to quantify the physical aspects of coherence .",
    "coherence was often defined in terms of functions of the off - diagonal entries of a density matrix , and the definition justified on the basis of physical intuition , which in turn also lead to the idea of decoherence developing along similar lines @xcite .",
    "eventually , in 2014 , baumgratz _",
    "et al_. @xcite defined a resource theory of coherence and rigorously quantified the role of coherence in close analogy to the resource theory of entanglement .",
    "let us formally introduce the measures of coherence in the framework of a resource theory that is based on the set of incoherent operations and incoherent states @xcite .",
    "coherence is a basis dependent property and hence first , we must fix a _",
    "reference basis_. the choice of the reference basis may be dictated by the underlying physics of the problem ( say the energy eigenbasis ) or the task to be performed ( wherever we wish to use quantum coherence ) .",

    "<S> grover s search algorithm is the optimal quantum algorithm that can search an unstructured database quadratically faster than any known classical algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the role of entanglement and correlations in the search algorithm have been studied in great detail and it is known that entanglement between the qubits is necessary to gain a quadratic speedup , for pure state implementation of the grover search algorithm . here , we systematically investigate the behavior of quantum coherence and monogamy of entanglement in the discrete analogue of the _ analog analogue of grover search algorithm_. the analog analogue of grover search is a continuous time quantum algorithm based on the adiabatic hamiltonian evolution that gives a quadratic speedup , similar to the original grover search algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the decrease of quantum coherence , quantified using various coherence monotones , is a clear signature of attaining the maximum success probability in the analog grover search . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that for any two qubit reduced density matrix of the system , the concurrence evolves in close vicinity to the increasing rate of success probability . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the system satisfies a @xmath0-party monogamy inequality for arbitrary times , hence bounding the amount of @xmath0-qubit entanglement during the quantum search . </S>"
