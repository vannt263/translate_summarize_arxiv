    "in the last two decades several experiments have provided strong evidence in favor of the neutrinos oscillation hypothesis . in the so called _ atmospheric sector _ the flavor conversion was first established by super - kamiokande@xcite and further by macro@xcite and soudan-2@xcite experiments .",
    "further confirmation was more recently obtained by the k2k@xcite and minos@xcite long - baseline experiments .",
    "however a two fold question is still unanswered , does the oscillation scenario correspond to the simple 3-flavor expectation or not ? which is related to the still unobserved direct appearance of one flavor to another , in particular to the highly expected @xmath0 oscillation .",
    "answer to this two - fold question is relevant mainly to proceed towards the next steps in the clarification of the leptonic sector of the particle model .    after a brief reminder of the physics behind we will assay to focus on the main points which brings us to the present knowledge about neutrino mixing .",
    "the recent history provided the scenario in which the neutrino oscillation framework was settled .",
    "still new questions opened up and these bring us directly into the future .",
    "next we will shortly report on the present results from short - base - line ( sbl ) experiment , mainly the miniboone@xcite experiment , and the long - base - line ( lbl ) experiments , namely minos and opera@xcite .",
    "finally some physics expectations for the near future after a personal discussion of the very recent opera results@xcite will be drawn .",
    "the issue of the lepton mixing is far from being understood and even generally described as it occurs in the quark sector .",
    "in particular the generic three questions on the reason the leptons mix themselves , the details of the way they actually mix and which are the mechanisms which underlay their mixing , arize . in 1998 a new history for neutrinos began as a sort of second life with the double discovery that ( a ) they oscillate@xcite then owing a mass after 41 years from the initial idea of b. pontecorvo in 1957@xcite and ( b ) they mix themselves in a peculiar way after the void result by chooz@xcite .",
    "the chooz experiment took data in 1997 - 98 at a distance of about 1 km from a nuclear power plant of two reactors in france .",
    "it aimed to observe @xmath1 ( actually antineutrinos ) oscillations .",
    "after a collection of 2991 @xmath2 candidates chooz put an upper limit on the direct observation of @xmath3 events . at that time the limit was set as @xmath4 with a systematic error of 2.7% .",
    "the low error was due to the possibility for chooz to measure the backgrounds before the switching on of the reactors .    in 2002",
    "the kamland experiment@xcite repeated the measure in a site in japan where many reactors were present , close and far away from the detector .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath2 flux coming from the reactors is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1.2](a ) , with an average distance of 150 km from the reactor .",
    "differently from chooz , kamland obtained a positive result in term of disappearance of @xmath2 flux . the beautiful oscillation pattern is shown in fig .  [ fig1.2](b ) .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    mainly after kamland ( and a rather contemporary result in the _ solar _ neutrino sector by the sno experiment@xcite ) the increase in the oscillation neutrino studies was extremely rapid and huge bringing to a re - interpretation of the chooz result in term of oscillations of flavour eigenstates .",
    "the old idea of mixing matrix by maki et al . in 1962@xcite was revitalized , similarly to what was made by cabibbo@xcite in 1963 for the quark sector .",
    "the standard parametrization of a mixing matrix at 3 components is therefore realized via the usual 3 euler rotations , leaving us with 3 angles , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and a phase @xmath8 .",
    "moreover in case of a majorana picture two more phases are present , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to emphasize the key point it comes out quite naturally to simply establish a similar way of mixing for quarks and leptons .",
    "of course other more complex scenarios , where more than 3 eigenstates appear , are possible .",
    "more neutrinos states are compatible with the present knowledge of the lepton physics , in particular one or more _ sterile _ neutrinos@xcite may be included .",
    "this is a fundament question since it may or it may not en strength parallelism between quarks and leptons",
    ".    the complete description of the formalism may be found in [ ] , while several fits have been performed to take into account the whole set of measurements .",
    "still fundamental questions remain unanswered .",
    "the first question relates to the mass ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates . does the mass scale ordering of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( as defined by the parametrization )",
    "follows the same ordering of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ?",
    "as the measured oscillation pattern is described only in term of @xmath17 and @xmath18 the exact order is not identified yet , neither it is the absolute mass scale .",
    "are the 3 masses just below the present neutrino mass absolute limit ( less than 1 ev ) or are they some order of magnitude smaller ?    more and more unanswered questions come up as we put a closer look to the measured quantities .",
    "for example in table  [ tab1 ] the present values of the mixing matrix components for quarks , @xmath19 , and for leptons , @xmath20 are compared .",
    "the underlying pattern is clearly different and we finally conclude that the lepton mixing is weird s angles have been done .",
    "see for example ref .  .",
    "] .    [ tab1 ]    also the present knowledge of the errors is largely different in the quark and lepton sector .",
    "see e.g. ref .   for an up - to - date report on the error measurements , to be compared with the extremely well known values of the quark mixing matrix@xcite . to illustrate the importance of the size of the errors we may look at fig .  [ figiss ] taken from ref .",
    "43 ) , which shows the large region for the possible values of the top angle of the lepton unitarity triangle .",
    "the degenerate case , @xmath21 , corresponding to the bottom horizontal line , is also still allowed by the present measurements .",
    "more and exhaustive discussions may be found in ref .  .    in summary",
    "we may conclude that the lepton mass mixing matrix might be technically similar to the quark one even if it shows a quite different pattern and it is at present rather poor known .",
    "we like to conclude this section by using the same wording of w. buchmller at eps09 conference@xcite : `` right - handed neutrinos have been found ; no exotics have been found ( yet ) '' .",
    "therefore as a whole it follows that we have to be prepared to the unexpected !",
    "currently the lepton scenario illustrated in the previous section is the only one which is receiving attention by experimental investigation and mostly phenomenological investigation too . other theoretical possibilities like e.g. the nsi , non - standard - interactions@xcite , are in our judgement not so appealing and remains at the level of generic phenomenological models .",
    "therefore a not so long list of unknowns have to be identified and measured : the 3 mixing angles ( @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 ) , the 2 neutrino squared mass differences ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , the sign of one the two mass differences ( @xmath22 ) , a cp phase ( @xmath8 ) , the absolute neutrino mass scale and their nature ( dirac or majorana ) , the total number of neutrino ( are there more than 3 neutrinos ? ) , not at last forgetting the detection of the undergoing source of the oscillation . the latter question corresponds to the detection of a direct appearance signal , that is the observation of the @xmath16 appearance for the atmospheric oscillation ( and the @xmath14 for the solar one ) providing a direct measurement of the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) process .",
    "most of the above items may be investigated at long - base - line experiments by excluding the investigation of the fundamental nature of the neutrinos and their absolute mass scale .",
    "the physics prospects are raveled by the `` presence '' of internal puzzles in the experimental side .",
    "in particular the recent results from miniboone are not able to disentangle the somewhat old and controversial result by lsnd@xcite . the original result from lsnd ( see fig .",
    "[ figlsnd ] ) of the @xmath23 observation could not be phenomenologically arranged in the 3 neutrino standard scenario .",
    "miniboone@xcite looked for the oscillation in either the neutrino or the antineutrino modes . in the neutrino mode it is able to rule out the result by lsnd as oscillation while observing an unexplained excess in a energy region below that of lsnd . in the antineutrino mode",
    "no similar excess is observed while the ruling out of lsnd is not gained .",
    "[ figminiboone ] ( a and b ) as extracted by ref",
    ".   shows the miniboone results .    as a matter of fact to the author",
    "the experimental situation is rather confused .",
    "more experimental facts are needed and the question whether the ongoing two lbl experiments minos and opera may help turns out to be fully relevant .",
    "the minos experiment@xcite is constituted by two similar apparata , the near and the far detectors , made of scintillator strips and a toroidal spectrometer .",
    "this layout allows the minimization of several uncertainties like the neutrino flux from the numi beam and the extrapolation via monte carlo of the unoscillated @xmath15 spectrum from near to far sites .",
    "a very detailed analysis allows to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrinos ( fig .",
    "[ figminos ] ) and estimate the percentage of disappeared neutrinos@xcite . from the later",
    "minos extracts the oscillation parameters in the assumption of 2 flavor oscillation mode ( fig .",
    "[ figminos1 ] from the analysis in [ ] ) .    since we will discuss in the next section the opera experiment it is worthwhile to outline the twofold character of the minos analysis , the `` rate '' and the `` shape '' . as opera will be able to deal only with `` rates '' , the latter significance power has to be compared with the corresponding one by minos which turned out to be rather poor ( fig .",
    "[ figminos2 ] ) .",
    "the disappearance mode can be complementary studied in minos with the appearance of electron @xmath24 .",
    "first results reported were indicative of a possible @xmath14 appearance : 35 events from @xmath14 interactions were observed against an expected background of @xmath25 , corresponding to a 1.5 excess@xcite .",
    "however very recent results ( released after the conference time ) with an increased statistics washed out that indication@xcite .",
    "it seems that the new dedicated experiments for the @xmath7 measurement have to be waited for ( see the related contributions to these proceedings ) .",
    "we will now discuss at length the opera experiment since the very recent on may 31@xmath26 2010 release of new results ( see next section ) corresponds to a relevant new contribution in the neutrino physics .    the opera experiment@xcite has been designed to observe the @xmath27 appearance in the cngs @xmath28 beam@xcite on an event by event basis . the @xmath27 signature is given by the decay topology of the short - lived @xmath29 leptons produced in the @xmath27 charged current ( cc ) interactions decaying to one prong ( electron , muon or hadron ) or three prongs hadrons .",
    "the detector is located underground in the laboratorio nazionale del gran sasso ( lngs , laquila , italy ) along the path of the cngs neutrino beam , 730 km away from the source at cern .",
    "the beam was optimized in order to maximize the number of @xmath27 cc interactions at the lngs site keeping the energy constraint to be above the @xmath29 production threshold .",
    "the result is a wide band neutrino beam with an average energy of @xmath30 gev ; the @xmath31 contamination is 2.1% , @xmath32 is below 1% and prompt @xmath27 at production is negligible . with a nominal beam intensity of @xmath33 proton - on - target ( p.o.t . ) per year , @xmath28 cc and neutral current ( nc ) interactions at gran sasso",
    "are deemed to  2900/(kton@xmath34year ) and 875/(kton@xmath34year ) , respectively . by assuming the oscillation parameters @xmath35 ev@xmath36 at full mixing 10.4 events",
    "are expected to be observed in opera in 5 years of data taking with a background of 0.75 events .    in the two years 2008 and 2009 opera succeeded@xcite to collect @xmath37 p.o.t . corresponding to 31,550 detected events in time with the beam , 5391 of which matched to a neutrino interaction in the opera target within more than 99% percent accuracy . at the cngs energies",
    "the average @xmath29 decay length is @xmath38 . in order to observe it opera",
    "makes use of @xmath39 nuclear emulsions films interspaced with @xmath40 thick lead plates which form the target mass of the opera detector .",
    "this technique , called emulsion cloud chamber ( ecc ) , has been used successfully by the donut experiment for the first direct observation@xcite of the @xmath27 . every time a trigger in the electronic detectors is compatible with an interaction inside the target ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) , the brick with the highest probability to contain the neutrino interaction vertex is extracted from the apparatus and exposed to x - rays for film - to - film alignment .",
    "further the brick is unsandwiched , the emulsion films are developed and analyzed .",
    "the final sensitivities are @xmath410.3 @xmath42 m spatial resolution , @xmath412 mrad angular resolution and @xmath4190% single track detection efficiency .",
    "* addendum * very recently opera reported the observation of a first @xmath16 candidate@xcite .",
    "the result is obtained by the observation of a rather clean event ( fig .",
    "[ tauevt ] ) , a possible 1-prong hadron decay of a @xmath29 lepton with @xmath43 derived by the presence of some electromagnetic showers .",
    "the decay topology is consistent to be that of @xmath44 .",
    "even if the expected number of @xmath16 interactions and identification in opera is estimated to be @xmath45 , well in agreement with the possible observation of 1 @xmath16 event , the significance of the result depends totally on the value of the background .",
    "opera estimates the background to be @xmath46 for the _",
    "1-prong _ decay channel where the candidate has been observed .",
    "that corresponds to a probability of 1.8% to fluctuate to 1 event , which may be interpreted as a significance of 2.36 sigma s towards the observation of a @xmath16 interaction ( _ p_-values of the null hypothesis , see ref .",
    "[ ] ) .    at first sight it may be surprising to extract such level of significance from just one event .",
    "that is the power of a _",
    "clean _ experiment .",
    "it is ilustrated in fig .",
    "[ prob1 ] where the significance of the result is drafted towards the number of events observed instead of the usual integrated _ luminosity _ of the data collected .",
    "the curves parametrized as function of the number of p.o.t collected by opera candidates and background events have been extracted and used from the opera proposal@xcite in 2001 . ]",
    "show that very few events allow to set a quite robust physics result . on top of",
    "that it is also evident that whether opera will be able to decrease the level of background the significance will increase it .",
    "for example , in case the estimated background be increased / decreased of a factor 2 , retaining the assumed 50% nuisance , the corresponding significances will decrease / increase as 2.10 and 2.61 , respectively . from another point of view the detection of a second ( third ) @xmath16 candidate , with the present level of total background proportionally updated ,",
    "will increase the statistical significance from 2.01 to 2.82 ( 3.42 ) .",
    "the latter consideration may demonstrate that the opera result be potentially much more interesting that the actual measurement by super - kamiokande which set a 2.4 significance in the @xmath16 appearance observation@xcite .",
    "the opera result , at 98.2% of probability , corresponds to an extremely important evidence which can be expressed in several ways .",
    "for example , we may say that it is the first direct evidence of lepton flavor violation , the theoretical unsatisfaction of the standard models being from now on even more evident .",
    "the observation of the transition from one flavor to the other should constraint and open new horizons to the theoretical elaborations , not forgetting the parallelism ( somehow _ opposite _ in term of flavor eigenstates ) with the quark sector .",
    "the second important point which is left to opera for the near future is to answer the question about the number of oscillated @xmath16 .",
    "that issue is well illustrated by a plot similar to the previous one ( fig .",
    "[ prob2 ] ) where the _ distance _ in terms of sigma s from the minos expectation is drawn towards the number of observed events .",
    "the result is parametrized as function of number of p.o.t . from the figure",
    "we may deduce that it will take some time to disentangle any deviation from the standard oscillation scenario .",
    "however it is will be fully worthwhile to pursue it .",
    "the neutrino oscillation scenario began to be clarified in 1998 with the observation of a disappearance of atmosferic @xmath15 , followed by the determination of similar disappearance ( and indirect appearance ) in the solar sector .",
    "the scenario that rose up is based on a 3-flavor oscillation which however leave out some intriguing concerns like the lsnd result and the presence or not of _ sterile _ neutrinos . in that context",
    "possible correlations with the similar mixing pattern of the quark sector are still at the level of theoretical exercises .",
    "the powerful results by minos settled a stringent measurement on the @xmath15 oscillation .",
    "the very recent result by opera , even if still at the level of _ evidence _ , demonstrates the action of lfv and it rules out for the time being the presence of _ sterile _ neutrinos . the large numbers of experiments undergoing all over the world to search for a @xmath7 value different from zero corresponds to a lively field of physics interest ( see other contributions on these proceedings )",
    ". however more than usual it is necessary to outline the lesson from past , nature is not obvious and the lack of experimental confirmations about theoretical models should encourage us to be prepared on the unexpected .",
    "it is a pleasure to thanks the very warm hospitality of the organizers and the kind invitation .",
    "the presentation allowed the author to further elaborate on the very attractive field of neutrino physics . some results and discussions reported in these proceedings",
    "were stimulated just for this occasion .",
    "some of the statistical elaborations have been checked through by my colleague s. dusini .",
    "also i want to thank m. mezzetto for a critical reading of the draft , many of his suggestions have been incorporated in the present version .",
