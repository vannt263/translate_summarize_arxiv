    "these studies have shown that laes are fairly common from 2 @xmath2 z @xmath2 7 , and more interestingly , their properties do not evolve strongly with time , with stellar populations and observed ly@xmath4 luminosity functions which are roughly constant over this redshift range .",
    "@xcite discovered @xmath0 100 low - redshift laes from 0.2 @xmath2 z @xmath2 0.45 with the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) .",
    "they ruled out objects with ly@xmath4  line widths @xmath5 1200 km s@xmath6 as broad - lined active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , although they typically could not rule out narrow - lined agn , as the ciii ] or civ diagnostic lines were either too faint , or located in a noisy part of the spectrum .",
    "they found that the ly@xmath4 luminosity function of these objects was substantially different than at high - redshift , with low - redshift laes having a lower surface density and being typically less luminous in the ly@xmath4  line .    in @xcite , we studied the physical properties of 30 of these laes which had optical counterparts in the extended chandra deep field  south ( cdf  s ) and extended groth strip ( egs ) , and found them to be significantly older and more massive than their high - redshift counterparts , with typical ages of a few gyr , and stellar masses of @xmath0 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 .",
    "a few of these objects were poorly fit , which could imply agn contamination , but with only one object detected in x - rays , we could not discern agns from star - forming galaxies . in this letter , we present an optical spectroscopic study of 23 of these low - redshift laes in order to determine the agn fraction in laes at low redshift . while deharveng et al .",
    "have already ruled out most broad - lined agn , optical spectroscopy will enable us to search for narrow - lined agn .",
    "where applicable , we assume h@xmath9 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath10 = 0.3 and @xmath11 = 0.7 ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we observed 23 low - redshift laes in the egs using hectospec at the 6.5 m mmt , which has a 1@xmath12 diameter field - of - view @xcite .",
    "we obtained 2 hours of spectroscopy on 19 march 2009 , with spectral coverage from @xmath0 3650 - 9200  , and spectral resolution of @xmath0 5  .",
    "we used the external specroad pipeline for data reduction ( developed by juan cabanela ; private communication ) .",
    "this pipeline performs standard spectroscopic reductions , including bias , dark and flat correction , and wavelength calibration ( rms residuals @xmath13 0.1  ) .",
    "we flux - calibrated the spectra using observations of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) f - type stars .",
    "further details on the observations and data reduction , as well as tabulated line fluxes , will be presented in a future paper ( finkelstein et al .",
    "2009 , in prep ) .",
    "the 23 laes varied in redshift from 0.2 @xmath1 z @xmath1 0.45 , thus we found 31 possible spectral lines which we could detect , from mgii @xmath14 2796 , 2803 to [ sii ] @xmath156733 .",
    "we examined the expected position ( using the redshift from @xcite as a first estimate ) of each of the expected lines in each spectrum , and noted whether it was detected .",
    "we fit a gaussian curve to each detected line , using the mpfit idl software package , obtaining the continuum flux , central wavelength , gaussian @xmath16 and line flux .",
    "errors on each of these parameters were estimated via monte carlo simulations by varying each spectral data point within its photometric uncertainty .",
    "table 1 lists the object redshifts as determined from this spectroscopy , which are consistent with ( and refine ) those published in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fullspec ] shows spectra of two of the observed laes , one which we classify as an agn , and one which is dominated by star formation . while some features are obviously different in the agn , many still appear the same , thus one requires numerous diagnostics to investigate the presence of an agn . combining our spectra with the public data from the all  wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ; @xcite ) , we perform five tests to search for agn . we first search for broad - lined agn by examining the widths of permitted lines .",
    "we then search our dataset for emission lines from ions which require high energies to ionize their current state , such as [ nev ] ( 126.2 ev ) .",
    "next , we use ratios of emission lines to classify them using diagnostic plots from ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bpt ) .",
    "we then use infrared data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ to probe for warm dust re - emission from absorbed high - energy photons . finally , we use archival _ chandra x - ray observatory _ data to search for x - ray emission , which could be indicative of an accretion disk around a central black hole . in the following section ,",
    "the object ids refer to those defined in @xcite . in table 1",
    "we list these ids along with the ids from @xcite .",
    "lines from the broad - line region of agns have velocities @xmath17 1000 km s@xmath6 , while narrow - line region lines have widths @xmath1 500 km s@xmath6 .",
    "depending on the orientation , one may only see one of these regions , leading to two separate classification of agns : broad - lined agn ( blagn , also called type 1 or seyfert 1 ) , and narrow - lined agn ( nlagn ; type 2 ; seyfert 2 ) . for each object , we measured the characteristic line velocity widths for all detectable , permitted transitions of hi , hei and heii .",
    "only egs24 has a velocity width @xmath5 1000 km s@xmath6 , with v = 1064 @xmath18 17 km s@xmath6 , and thus likely contains a blagn .",
    "the remaining objects have v @xmath19 300 km s@xmath6 , implying that if an agn is present in the rest of the sample , it is narrow - lined .",
    "[ nev ] and heii are two of the strongest indicators of agn activity to which our data are sensitive .",
    "we detect [ nev ] @xmath153347 or [ nev ] @xmath153427 in egs16 , egs17 , egs18 and egs24 at @xmath5 3 @xmath16 significance , and in egs14 and egs20 , at 2.9 and 2.0 @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the heii @xmath154686 line is also an agn indicator , and this line is observed at @xmath20 3 @xmath16 significance in egs2 , and at 2.6 @xmath16 in egs24 .",
    "we note that although heii emission can also come from the winds of wolf - rayet stars , these lines are typically broad ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus that is likely not the case here .",
    "in addition , while the [ nev ] emission is most likely due to an agn , there is the possibility that it arises due to shocks , although none of our objects solely identified by this line inhabit the bpt plane ( see   3.3 ) near the shock models of @xcite ( c.f .",
    "[ neiii ] @xmath153869 is detected in numerous objects .",
    "however , this line may not conclusively point to an agn , as its ionization potential is not much greater than [ oiii ] . as a control sample , we examined sdss spectroscopic data , to see where objects with detected [ neiii ] emission inhabit the bpt diagram .",
    "we found that at all fluxes , objects with [ neiii ] emission populate both the star - forming and agn sequences , implying that [ neiii ] emission is not conclusive evidence of an agn .      in figure 2",
    "we plot ratios of h@xmath4/[nii ] versus [ oiii]/h@xmath21 to diagnose the ionizing source within a galaxy @xcite . in this plane",
    "galaxies segregate nicely , with separate star - forming and agn sequences .",
    "the contours represent the two sequences as defined using @xmath0 10@xmath22 sdss galaxies , with the lighter contours representing the star - forming sequence , and the darker contours representing the agn sequence .",
    "we plot each of our objects on this plane using the various colored symbols .",
    "we also plot the theoretical maximum starburst line from @xcite and the star formation / agn demarcation line from @xcite .",
    "we estimated flux limits for undetected lines by placing mock emission lines in the spectrum , and decreasing the line strength until the detection significance dropped below 3 @xmath16 , finding that 1 @xmath16 line flux limits were typically @xmath13 1.0 @xmath23 10@xmath24 erg s@xmath6 @xmath25 . in objects where any of these lines was undetected",
    ", we plot their 3 @xmath16 upper - limits .",
    "egs1 , egs3 , egs14 , egs15 and egs24 appear to unambiguously lie on the agn sequence , and we henceforth classify them as agn .",
    "egs24 has already been noted for its broad emission lines , as well as its [ nev ] and heii emission , and egs14 also has a 2.9 @xmath16 [ nev ] detection .",
    "although egs1 , egs3 and egs15 were not indicated by either of our previous classification methods , they are located very far from the star - forming sequence , and significantly higher than the maximum starburst curve .",
    "however , egs1 appears to be in the liner regime , and thus if an agn is present , it may not be dominating the observed continuum and line fluxes .",
    "egs16 , egs17 and egs21 lie in regions which could correspond to either agn or star - forming galaxies , as well as near the kauffmann et al",
    ".  demarcation line .",
    "egs16 and egs17 have detected [ nev ] emission .",
    "as egs21 was not indicated by any of our previous methods , thus we also only consider it a possible agn .",
    "@xcite also derived classifications using lines of oi and [ oii ] , and their fig .",
    "4 , which plots oi @xmath156300/h@xmath4 versus [ oii]/[oiii ] , shows a clear separation in oi @xmath156300/h@xmath4 , with nearly all power - law ionization objects ( i.e. agn ) having log(oi / h@xmath4 ) @xmath17 -1 , and all star - forming objects having log(oi / h@xmath4 ) @xmath1 -1.5 .",
    "we find that out of the five objects which have @xmath20 3 @xmath16 detections of oi @xmath156300 , egs10 and egs24 exhibit log(oi",
    "/ h@xmath4 ) indicative of agn activity , of -0.74 and -1.05 , respectively .",
    "egs10 was not indicated by any of our previous classification methods , thus we now regard it as a possible agn .",
    "@xcite defined a color - color region using colors from the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) which preferentially selects agn in the redshift range of our sample ( 20% contamination ) , due to the rising power law spectrum ( i.e. from warm dust ) exhibited by these objects .",
    "we examined the aegis irac catalog and found that four of our objects were covered by the irac data : egs1 , egs9 , egs15 and egs27 .",
    "all four were detected in all irac bands , while only egs27 lies within the selection wedge , at @xmath0 1 @xmath16 from the edge .",
    "thus , we regard egs27 as a possible agn . while other methods select the remaining three objects as agn , they all reside outside the wedge .",
