    "the recent discovery of strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma at rhic @xcite has spurred a significant theoretical effort towards understanding the properties of matter described by strongly coupled quantum field theories at finite temperature .",

    "the transport properties of a theory are closely related to the spectral functions of the operators such as stress - energy tensor .",
    "in particular , viscosity can be determined from the low frequency limit of the spectral function by the well - known kubo formula .",

    ". in particular , the shear channel sum rule derived in @xcite has been verified in the @xmath1 susy ym using ads / cft correspondence .    in this paper , we concentrate on the sum rule for the spectral function in the bulk channel , corresponding to uniform dilatation or isotropic expansion .",
    "the bulk channel sum - rule is trivial in a conformal theory such as @xmath1 susy ym .",
    "however , nontrivial sum rules in qcd do exists and have been a subject of recent studies @xcite . unlike the shear channel , the bulk channel correlation function ( and associated bulk viscosity ) is sensitive not only to the strength of the coupling , but also to the amount of the scaling violation .",
    "therefore we consider a holographic model with the simplest mechanism of conformality violation , which is similar to qcd .",
    "we shall assume that this model describes field theories where scale invariance is broken by the presence of a scalar operator @xmath2 with dimension @xmath3 in the action .",
