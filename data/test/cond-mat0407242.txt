    "the nature of the ground state of doped quantum antiferromagnets is a central issue for the theory of correlated electrons . @xcite while it is well established that arbitrary small doping destroys conventional nel order , it is far less clear what is the structure of the emerging ground state , and how it co - exists with superconductivity .",
    "one of the early proposals made in ref .  , and later explored in the context of the hubbard and the @xmath5 models",
    ", @xcite was that for small doping the collinear nel order gives way to a non - collinear spiral state .",
    "energy is gained since the holes can hop easier in a spiral background .",
    "however it was also established that the spiral state is itself unstable with respect to long wavelength density fluctuations , i.e. has a tendency towards phase separation , signaled by a negative charge compressibility .",
    "the general problem of what states are susceptible to instabilities , such as phase separation , and what is the true ground state of the doped antiferromagnet , is enjoying a lot of current attention .",
    "@xcite some works favor , under certain conditions , inhomogeneous ground states , such as stripes , where the holes segregate into ordered structures , @xcite whereas others argue that ultimately the ground state is uniform .",
    "@xcite    we have recently revisited the problem of stability of the spiral state in the extended @xmath0 model , @xcite and have found that the uniform spiral state is stable ( at low doping ) above certain critical values of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition we have shown that superconductivity is supported in the stable region . partial motivation for this research",
    "was provided by the considerable body of evidence that ( incommensurate ) magnetism co - exists with superconductivity in the lsco family .",
    "@xcite such experiments are usually interpreted in the context of stripes , @xcite however the ( uniform ) spiral scenario is quite consistent with the majority of data , especially in the range of doping where the charge order is `` fluctuating '' , i.e. not in the ground state .",
    "disorder is also expected to be important in these compounds , and can be readily incorporated into the spiral state .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we use chiral perturbation theory @xcite as our main technical tool .",
    "the theory provides a rigorous perturbative treatment of long - wave - length dynamics with goldstone quasiparticles in a system with strong interactions .",
    "the starting point is the ground state of the heisenberg model ( @xmath5 model at half filling ) which incorporates all spin quantum fluctuations .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory allows a regular calculation of all physical quantities in the leading order approximation in powers of doping @xmath6 .",
    "subleading powers of @xmath6 depend on the short - range dynamics and hence can not be calculated without uncontrolled approximations .",
    "therefore we can not determine reliably what is the exact value of @xmath6 so that it is small enough to justify our calculations .",
    "however the limit @xmath1 justifies the approach parametrically .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we concluded that the spiral state is stable in a certain region of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown that the magnetic stability is due to the existence of spin quantum fluctuations ( order from disorder effect ) . while the strong renormalization of one hole properties due to scattering with magnons was taken into account in ref .",
    ", the calculation of the compressibility at finite doping ( charge response ) was made for free holes ( zero - loop approximation ) , and the calculation of the magnetic response was performed in the one - loop approximation . in the present paper",
    "we extend our calculations up to two loops for both the charge and the magnetic response .",
    "the results demonstrate that perturbation theory converges very well .",
    "the main conclusion that the magnetic stability is provided by spin quantum fluctuations ( order from disorder effect ) remains valid in two loops , however the higher corrections are found to have an important effect on the charge stability region in the space of parameters @xmath2 , generally increasing stability .",
    "we start by summarizing some results and the notation of ref .   which will be needed for our calculations . in the s=1/2",
    "extended @xmath5 model , one allows hopping to nearest - neighbor sites ( @xmath9 ) , as well as ( diagonal ) next nearest - neighbors @xmath7 , and next next nearest sites @xmath8 on a 2d square lattice : @xmath10 the @xmath11 operators act in the space with no douple electron occupancy . the number of added holes , per site , is denoted by @xmath6 , and is referred to as doping .",
    "we also set the total number of sites @xmath12 and measure all the energies from now on in units of @xmath13 which we set to one , while @xmath9 is set to its physical value : @xmath14 the same - sublattice hoppings @xmath2 will be considered as parameters , having in mind that in the cuprates their values are argued to be @xmath15 , from fits of arpes measurements .",
    "@xcite    the one - hole green s function is calculated in the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) , which produces reliable results due to the absence of low - order vertex corrections .",
    "@xcite the hole dispersion minima are located at the points @xmath16 , which are the centers of the four faces of the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) . in the vicinity of these points",
    "the dispersion is quadratic : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is defined with respect to @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is perpendicular to the face of the mbz , while @xmath21 is parallel to it .",
    "the quasiparticle residue near @xmath19 is @xmath22 . by implementing the scba equations numerically ,",
    "we have obtained the coefficients in the following expansion , valid in the range @xmath23 , @xmath24 : @xcite @xmath25 then the renormalized hole - magnon interaction is written in the long - wavelength limit , by introducing the operator @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the two spin waves in a two - sublattice antiferromagnet . calling the two sublattices",
    " a \" and  b \" and introducing the corresponding ( renormalized ) hole operators @xmath28 , we obtain the hamiltonian describing the interactions between holes and spin waves : @xmath29 for simplicity from now on we refer to the renormalized ( dressed ) holes simply as holes .",
    "the vertex in ( [ hsw ] ) is ( @xmath30 is perpendicular to the mbz face ) : @xmath31 we stress that @xmath32 at @xmath33 in accordance with the general adler s relation .",
    "@xcite in a spiral state the spins deviate from the nel order , leading to lowering of the ground state energy and creation of a gap in the hole spectrum .",
    "the spiral pitch @xmath34 can be directed along the ( 1,1 ) or ( 1,0 ) direction of the lattice and is proportional to doping @xmath35 .",
    "the new hole operators @xmath36 , and the corresponding energies are : @xmath37 the spiral is a coplanar state with spins lying in a fixed plane .",
    "the arbitrary phase @xmath38 is related to the orientation of this plane , which , as we will see below , does not appear in any physical observables . the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 describe spinless fermions , and due to ( [ ops ] ) the @xmath41 fermion band is completely empty .",
    "the gap and the fermi energy are : @xmath42 here @xmath43 ( s=1/2 ) is the renormalized spin stiffness of the undoped antiferromagnet , and @xmath44 stands for the number of full pockets enclosed by the fermi surface . for the ( 1,0 ) spiral @xmath45 , while for the 45@xmath46 spiral ( 1,1 ) there is only one pocket @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite notice that except for the band splitting ( [ ops ] ) which absorbs the soft mode of the doped heisenberg antiferromagnet we assume that the dispersion ( [ disp ] ) remains rigid under doping .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we analyze the charge stability of the spiral states , while section iii is devoted to the stability in the magnetic sector .",

    "the two simplest contributions to the energy come from the fermi motion of holes and from the energy gain due to the spiral formation .",
    "these two contributions are : @xcite @xmath52 the superscript @xmath53 in the energy shows that interaction effects have not been taken into account ( no loops ) .",
    "we note that the terms that are not quadratic in @xmath6 are not explicitly written , i.e. we have subtracted from the energy the constant and linear terms : @xmath54 .",
    "the holes interact via spin wave exchange . treating the hole - magnon interaction ( [ hsw ] ) in the second order of perturbation theory ( the @xmath55 operators have to be expressed via the @xmath56 operators from ( [ ops ] ) ) we obtain the effective low - energy hole - hole interaction vertex : @xmath57 here",
    "we have neglected both the retardation effects as well as the hole energies in the denominators .",
    "this approximation should work well in the limit of low doping @xmath1 since typical hole energies @xmath58 , while the magnon energy @xmath59 , for @xmath1 .",
    "notice also that @xmath60 and consequently the interaction is strong even in the long - wave - length limit .",
    "the one - loop correction to the energy is given by the exchange diagram in fig .",

    "the direct term , proportional to @xmath63 is set to zero , by keeping in mind the presence of a small non - zero frequency in the denominator of ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "notice the overall sign ( + ) in eq .",
    "( [ exch ] ) which is opposite to the sign appearing for an electron gas with coulomb interactions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the interaction ( [ gamma ] ) is attractive . introducing the rescaled variables : @xmath64 , @xmath65",

    "@xcite in fact each of the two - loop diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] contains an ultraviolet logarithmic divergence , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is an ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "however the divergences are canceled out between the direct and the exchange diagrams , since the fermions @xmath36 are spinless .    in the next , third order of perturbation theory the only diagrams containing ultraviolet divergences are the `` ladder '' ones , shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "both diagrams separately are proportional to @xmath77 , and , once again , the divergences are canceled out exactly when the direct and exchange terms are added together . by examining also higher orders we find quite generally that the perturbative expansion behaves well .",
    "the absence of divergences is due to the dimensionality of the problem as well as the goldstone nature of the mediator of the interaction .",

    "therefore , defining @xmath83 to be the inverse compressibility of the ( 1,0 ) spiral state , i.e. @xmath84 , we have : @xmath85 thus whenever the ( 1,0 ) state is lower in energy @xmath86 , it is stable @xmath87 , whereas the ( 1,1 ) state is always unstable , because if @xmath88 then @xmath89 and hence @xmath90 .     model at @xmath91 ( throughout the work we take @xmath92 ) .",

    "( [ int],[e11 ] ) we have neglected the contact interaction energy @xmath95 , arising from the last ( density - density ) term in ( [ h ] ) , proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "in fact one could imagine adding an additional nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion energy @xmath96 to ( [ h ] ) of the form @xmath97 . then the total contact energy to lowest order is : @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the presence of the @xmath100 term generally increases @xmath83 ; however as long as @xmath101 , the contact energy s contribution to the total energy is extremely small , since all the terms in eq .",

    "we have found numerically that the relative importance of each successive order of perturbation theory decreases roughly by a factor of 3 .",

    "the insert demonstrates the good convergence of the perturbation theory .",
    "it is interesting that account of the interaction corrections ( one and two - loop corrections ) enlarges the region of stability in the space of parameters @xmath2 .",

    "this means that ( [ stab2 ] ) is equivalent to the equation @xmath124 this is the same condition as the one obtained @xcite in the one - loop approximation .",
    "this condition is always satisfied since @xmath125 , and @xmath126 due to spin quantum fluctuations renormalization in the undoped s=1/2 antiferromagnet .",
    "the physical meaning of the `` quantum stabilization '' is quite simple . indeed , treating the spins semiclassically we would have @xmath127 and hence a marginal ground state .",

    "the last issue we would like to address is the variation of the hole dispersion with doping and its influence on the phase diagram of fig .  4 .",
    "while the renormalization of the one - hole properties at zero doping has already been taken into account via the scba , eq .",
    "( [ ttt ] ) , at finite doping the many - body hole - hole interaction corrections originating from the vertex ( [ gamma ] ) have to be calculated .    the leading self - energy diagram , contributing to the hole dispersion at finite doping is shown in fig .  6 .",
    "the corresponding expression is @xmath128 the self - energy is the same for @xmath51 and @xmath41 fermions and therefore it influences the dispersion ( [ disp ] ) , but does not influence the gap @xmath129 between the bands .",
    "the one - loop self - energy depends only on the momentum of the particle .",
    "we remind the reader that the one - loop self - energy is closely related to the one - loop correction to the total energy , namely by cutting a fermionic line in diagram fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) one obtains the self - energy fig .",
    "this means that the self - energy effect has already been taken into account in the calculation of the total energy performed in section ii .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to see explicitly how the dispersion changes .",
    "the integral in ( [ se1 ] ) can be easily evaluated numerically at any point of the phase diagram fig .",

    "finally , we can summarize our findings : ( i. ) the leading order self - energy correction produces a weak , doping independent spectrum renormalization .",
    "the charge stability analysis of section ii performed up to ( two - loop ) order @xmath139 is not influenced , at that order , by the change in the spectrum . taking the latter effect into account produces higher order diagrams and is expected to be a very small correction , due to the previous point ( i ) .",

    "the stability was studied both in the charge and in the spin sectors , and takes into account interaction effects by including diagrams up to two loops .",
    "our main result is that relatively small values of @xmath2 are sufficient to stabilize the ( 1,0 ) spiral state , as shown in fig .",
    "for example for @xmath141 , the critical value of @xmath7 is @xmath142 , or in units of @xmath9 , @xmath143 ( for @xmath4 ) .",
    "the unstable region for small @xmath2 is a good candidate for an inhomogeneous ground state of some sort , e.g. a striped one .",
    "our results are also consistent with dmrg studies @xcite of the extended @xmath5 model predicting a transition from stripes at @xmath144 to a homogeneous ground state around @xmath145 .",
    "parameters for real cuprates correspond to the top left corner of the phase diagram fig .  4 where the ( 1,0 ) spiral state is stable .",
    "we have shown that the interaction effects ( higher loop diagrams ) should be taken into account and they tend to increase the region of spiral stability in the space of parameters @xmath2 .",
    "the effective coupling constant governing the perturbation theory is @xmath146 .",
    "therefore each successive order is several times weaker than the previous one , and thus we expect our results , calculated up to second order , to be quite reliable .",
    "the good convergence is demonstrated by the inset in fig .  4 where we show the critical lines calculated in zero , one and two - loop orders .",
    "the magnetic stability of the spiral state is guaranteed by spin quantum fluctuations ( order from disorder effect ) - this conclusion remains valid in the two - loop approximation .",
    "our calculations are based on the chiral perturbation theory , therefore they are reliable only in the limit @xmath1 , whereas the finite doping renormalizations of the various green s functions and vertices become more and more substantial as doping increases , leading essentially to an untreatable problem .",

    "<S> we analyze the @xmath0 model at low doping @xmath1 by chiral perturbation theory and show that the ( 1,0 ) spiral state is stabilized by the presence of @xmath2 above critical values around @xmath3 , assuming @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ( magnon mediated ) hole - hole interactions have an important effect on the region of charge stability in the space of parameters @xmath2 , generally increasing stability , while the stability in the magnetic sector is guaranteed by the presence of spin quantum fluctuations ( order from disorder effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions are based on perturbative analysis performed up to two loops , with very good convergence . </S>"
