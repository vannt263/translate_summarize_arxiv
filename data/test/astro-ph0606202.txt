    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars containing a white dwarf ( wd ) primary and a low mass secondary ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "cvs that contain a highly magnetic wd , with surface fields ranging from 10250 mg , are called polars . in a polar ,",
    "accreted material flows along magnetic field lines , does not form a viscous disk , and accretes directly onto the wd at / near its magnetic pole(s ) .",
    "polars are well known to stop and ( re)start their mass transfer , causing changes of @xmath123 ( or more ) optical magnitudes at apparently random intervals . during low states ,",
    "the accretion flux disappears and the two component stars can often be cleanly observed . for the past few decades , theoretical models of cv evolution ( kolb 1993 ; howell et al .",
    "2001 ) have predicted that the very shortest orbital period systems should contain low mass , brown dwarf - like secondary stars .",
    "more recently , near - ir ( @xmath2 ) observations of the shortest period cvs ( e.g. , harrison et al .  2003 ; howell et al .",
    "2004 ) have provided evidence that they likely do contain secondaries similar to l or t dwarfs .",
    "we have accomplished an initial survey of four polars ( ef eridani , gg leonis , v347 pavonis , and rx j0154.0 - 5947 ) using the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the spitzer space telescope .",
    "we specifically chose ultra - short period polars ( @xmath3 min ) to facilitate studying the brown dwarf - like secondary stars predicted to be present .",
    "we found that all four of the polars show emission in the 38 @xmath0 m region in excess of that produced solely by the wd plus an m or l dwarf . in this letter , we briefly discuss our observations and possible sources of this excess emission .",
    "the best explanation is cool circumbinary dust that would likely dynamically settle into a disk , and/or possibly a t dwarf - like secondary star .",
    "irac is a four channel camera that obtains nearly simultaneous images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m ( see fazio et al .",
    "2005 ) . for our polars",
    ", we obtained 30-sec images using the gaussian-5 dither pattern .",
    "the dithered images were combined and flux calibrated with the s12 spitzer pipeline .",
    "details of our data reduction and error analysis procedures will be presented in brinkworth et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for our polars , comprised of our irac data ( table 1 ) and non - simultaneous 2mass @xmath4 photometry .",
    "we have classified the polars based on the overall appearance of their @xmath4 seds .",
    "ef eri was known to be in a low accretion state during its 2mass observation ( harrison et al .",
    "2004 ) , and we infer that v347 pav was also , based on its similar sed . we suspect that gg leo and rx j0154 were both in high accretion states during their 2mass observations , because of the falling rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) tail of accretion flux that dominates their @xmath4 seds . we note that the 2mass bands are sensitive to the mass accretion state of the system ( high states show a falling rj tail , low states probably begin to reveal the secondary star ) while the irac bands are red enough to be essentially unaffected by these changes .",

    "our spitzer observations show that all four polars present a similar , relatively flat sed in the irac region .",
    "the 38 @xmath0 m emission does not fall off to the red as it would if the source was a hot blackbody or the stellar rj tail of an m or l star .",
    "we now examine some possibilities for its origin .",
    "the high magnetic fields in polars can produce cyclotron emission in the uv  near - ir spectral regions as accreted material is ionized and the free electrons spiral along field lines ( warner 1995 ) . at times",
    ", cyclotron cooling can become the dominant cooling mechanism ( cropper 1990 ) and its blue spectrum consists of large hump features @xmath11000  wide that can increase the local continuum by up to one magnitude .",
    "a thorough review of model cyclotron spectra is given in wickramasinghe & ferrario ( 2000 , hereafter wf2000 ) .",
    "spectral intensity and shape , as well as any harmonic structures ( humps ) , are dependent on magnetic field strength , electron temperature and density , and viewing angle .",
    "cyclotron spectra are characterized by a long wavelength rj tail and a slowly rising , power - law blue continuum modulated by harmonic hump features .",
    "the peak of this pseudo - blackbody spectrum moves blueward as the magnetic field strength increases ( e.g. , fig .",
    "32 in wf2000 ) .",
    "fields of 1430 mg , as found in our target polars ( warner 1995 ) , produce power law continua and observable humps in the optical  near - ir spectral region , with optically thick rj tails at longer wavelengths .",
    "if we ( incorrectly ) attribute all the @xmath5 band flux in ef eri to the rj tail of cyclotron emission , then we would expect the irac observations to produce flux densities of @xmath6 114 , 58 , and 38 @xmath0jy at 4 , 6 , and 8 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "this is not consistent with our observations . in order for the cyclotron spectrum alone to produce a relatively flat sed in the 38 @xmath0",
    "m region , the irac observations would have to sample the power - law portion ( plus humps ) .",
    "this would require magnetic field strengths of only a few mg , which may be found in polars at large distances from the wd ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "fields of 12 mg occur at about 23 wd radii in our polars , assuming conservation of magnetic flux density . at the same viewing geometry and opacity",
    ", the emission volume in this low field region will be larger than at the accretion pole by a factor @xmath8 , but the electron temperature and material density will be lower .",
    "the ratio of overall spectral intensity from the low field region ( @xmath9 ) compared to the pole region ( @xmath10 ) is proportional to @xmath11 ( see eqn .",
    "53 in wf2000 ) where @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 kev , typical low state values at the magnetic pole on the wd surface .",
    "if we assign all the 3.6 @xmath0jy flux in ef eri ( 711 @xmath0jy ) to cyclotron emission from the main field , then weak field cyclotron radiation would produce a flat sed of only @xmath15 @xmath0jy across the irac bands .",
    "this is much fainter than our spitzer data , but is in agreement with recent limits set by non - detection of cyclotron emission in spitzer observations of intermediate polars ( johnson et al .",
    "2005 ) , which are believed to have wd surface fields of a few mg .",
    "thus , it seems that any cyclotron emission present in the irac bands would provide only a small addition to the observed flux , possibly as a low level rj tail , and can not , in itself , account for the observed shape or level of the 38 @xmath0 m sed in our polars .",
    "bremsstrahlung , or free - free emission , produces a flat sed and can be the dominant continuum source at radio wavelengths or in high temperature environments .",
    "the total energy ( in ergs ) radiated per @xmath16 per second for a pure hydrogen environment is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , the gaunt factor , is near 1 ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung is nearly independent of frequency until its cutoff frequency , a value set by the electron thermal velocity distribution ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) . at high temperatures ( @xmath20 k )",
    "this cutoff frequency is in the optical  ir , while lower temperatures only produce significant bremsstrahlung in the radio .    at typical electron densities",
    "( @xmath21 @xmath13 ) and high state temperatures ( 100,000600,000 k ) near the wd pole(s ) ( warner 1995 ) , and assuming an emission region of 0.1 of the wd area , @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 . over the irac bands , even such high temperature regions would provide a continuum level of only about @xmath24 @xmath0jy .",
    "this is @xmath25 less than expected from the rj tail of a 1500 k star at the distances of our polars ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "looking instead at low temperature environments within the cv , a temperature of only @xmath26 k will produce a cutoff frequency at 4 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , the number density of free electrons continuously kept at this temperature , which is required to produce measurable bremsstrahlung in the irac bands , must exceed @xmath27 @xmath13 .",
    "this is a highly unrealistic value",
    " it would require the total accumulated mass of many thousands of years of high state mass transfer ( @xmath28 yr@xmath23 ) between the two stars . in order to lower the number density of 3600",
    "k material to even a remotely plausible value of @xmath29 @xmath13 , a spherical radiating volume with radius near @xmath27 cm is needed .",
    "this is about 100,000 times the size of the binary orbit .",
    "we can , therefore , likely eliminate bremsstrahlung as the sole or major source of the observed ir seds in our polars .",
    "an interesting theoretical concept has been pursued of late ( e.g. , taam & spruit 2001 ) that predicts the existence of circumbinary disks of cool material in cvs .",
    "observational studies to find such disks have provided mixed results ( belle et al .",
    "2004 ; dubus et al .",
    "2004 ) and , to date , there is little direct observational evidence for their existence .",
    "becklin et al .  (",
    "2005 ) present observations of a dust disk surrounding gd362 , a single , cool ( @xmath30 k ) wd . in figure 2",
    ", we show the seds for ef eri and v347 pav ( from figure 1 ) with the optical  near - ir model of harrison et al .",
    "( 2003 ) plus the becklin et al .  model dust disk , scaled to the distance of ef eri ( 45 pc ) . the harrison et al .",
    "model for ef eri spans 3500  to the @xmath31 band and is based on actual observations of the cool ( @xmath32 k ) wd , and near - ir photometry and spectroscopy that led to a best - fit secondary approximating the sed of an l8 star .",
    "note the negligible contribution from the wd in ef eri seen in the extreme lower left corner of figure 2 .",
    "this illustrates the steepness of a stellar rj tail .",
    "the becklin et al .",
    "dust disk with @xmath33 k is likely to be too hot for our polars , as the inner edge of the circumbinary disk will be farther from the wd . scaling the inner edge of the disk in gd362 to that in our binaries ( assuming the inner edge must be outside the two stars ) we find that t@xmath34 would be near 800@xmath35200 k. this cooler disk model",
    "is also plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the dust disk model does a fairly good job of fitting the polar seds up to @xmath36 @xmath0 m but then rises too fast toward the red .",
    "the cooler 800 k model fits better but is still too bright in the longest irac band .",
    "the dust disk scaling performed here , and the better fit afforded by the cooler disk , are simple ad hoc models at present .",
    "detailed , more realistic dust disk models are being produced and will be presented in brinkworth et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we compared the seds of ef eri and v347 pav to those of single l and t dwarfs from the irac observed sample kindly provided by patten et al .",
    "the polar secondary stars have attained their present size , mass , and temperature after gyr of mass loss ; hence , they are brown dwarf - like but are unlikely to be exactly like brown dwarfs .",
    "the sed of an l6 dwarf falls off after 4.5 @xmath0 m ( dropping by a factor of 2 in brightness from 4.5 to 8 @xmath0 m ) , while the seds of late t dwarfs remain relatively flat throughout the irac bands .",
    "we conclude that t dwarf seds are more consistent than those of l dwarfs with our observed spectral shapes in the irac bands , but neither type of star reproduces the observations in detail . in particular , t dwarfs are quite faint , and would require the cvs to be at very small distances in order to contribute a large fraction of the observed irac flux densities .",
    "for example , if the irac fluxes were entirely due to the secondary star , ef eri would have to be at @xmath612 and @xmath66 pc if the secondary star were a t6.0 and t8.0 respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows an irac two - color diagram for our polars , along with several brown dwarfs from the patten et al .  sample ( l6 = sdss 1331 - 0116 ; t5 = 2mass 0559 - 1404 ; t8 = 2mass 0415 - 0935 ) .",
    "we have also plotted gd1400 , a detached wd+l5/6 binary with no dust ( farihi et al .",
    "2006 ) , and our simple dust disk model ( based on gd362 ) , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the effect of changing the gd362 model disk temperature from @xmath37 k to 800 k is shown in the lower right of the figure .",
    "for comparison , the irac colors of t leonis and vy aquarii are also plotted ; these are not - yet - published cvs that we have observed with spitzer .",
    "they have similar orbital periods and distances as our polars , but contain non - magnetic wds surrounded by hot ( @xmath38 k ) accretion disks .",
    "the seds of t leo and vy aqr are dominated by the rj tails of the secondary star and accretion disk well into the irac region .",
    "our observed polars occupy a region of color - space intermediate between wd+brown dwarf binaries without dust , single brown dwarfs , and dust disk - dominated systems .",
    "bremsstrahlung , while often producing a flat spectral continuum , likely contributes essentially nothing to our observed irac fluxes .",
    "cyclotron emission also appears unlikely to be a major contributor to the seds of our polars , since it should be present only as a low level falling rj tail .",
    "however , our understanding of the complex nature of cyclotron emission is far from perfect , so we hesitate to say with complete certainty that none of the excess emission is due to the cyclotron process . at present , the best candidates for the origin of the observed ir excess are cool dust ( in or near the cv ) and/or secondary stars that are similar to late t dwarfs .",
    "if the dust is produced by aeons of mass outflow from the cv ( in winds or nova outbursts ) or is possibly remnant material from the common envelope stage ejected with some orbital angular momentum ( e.g. , hinkle et al .",
    "2006 ) , then dynamic considerations lead us to expect that this material would settle into a circumbinary disk . if a dust disk is present and is similar to that seen around gd362 , then we expect the inner disk temperature to be around 800 k. the emitting volume of such a disk must be large compared to the component stars ( which are earth - sized and jupiter - sized ) , as it outshines even the cool brown dwarf - like secondary in the irac bands .",
    "if the 38 @xmath0 m sed originates primarily from the secondary star , then it would have to be similar to a late t dwarf and these cvs would have to be far closer than observations of their wds suggest .",
    "the likely presence of a circumbinary dust disk in polars naturally leads us to postulate that such disks might be common in other cvs .",
    "the 38 @xmath0 m region still contains a strong spectral contribution from the rj tail of the accretion disk in cvs with weakly- or non - magnetic wds . in longer period systems ,",
    "the larger , brighter g , k , and early m secondary stars also contribute in the irac bandpass .",
    "thus , the contrast from the weak ir emission of a dust disk against that produced by the stellar and other components in all but the polars may prevent detection shortward of 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "some support for this is provided by dubus et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who detected ss cygni and ae aquarii at 11 and 17 @xmath0 m , and by abada - simon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who detected ae aqr at wavelengths out to 170 @xmath0 m .",
    "neither a simple dust disk , as described here , nor a brown dwarf - like secondary star alone can fully explain the observed ir excess in the polars , especially redward of @xmath39 @xmath0 m .",
    "spectral observations would help distinguish between the possibilities discussed above and provide details regarding the cause of the observed ir excess .",
