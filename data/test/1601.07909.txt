    "over the last decade , optical and infrared studies of the so - called `` deep fields '' ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revolutionized our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "detailed studies of the cosmic star formation history have shown that the comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) density rises towards the end of epoch of reionization and peaks in the redshift range @xmath13 , before declining by an order of magnitude from @xmath14 to today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the range @xmath13 is often referred to as the `` epoch of galaxy assembly '' , as roughly half of today s stellar mass density was formed during this period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also known that the nature of the galaxies undergoing star formation evolves significantly from @xmath15 to today , via cosmic downsizing @xcite : the sfr density at @xmath16 is dominated by massive galaxies with high sfrs , while that at @xmath17 mostly arises in lower - mass systems with lower sfrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a tight relation ( the `` main sequence '' ) has been found between the specific sfr ( ssfr ) and the stellar mass of most high-@xmath18 star - forming galaxies @xcite , while a small fraction , the starbursts , undergo far more efficient star formation than main - sequence galaxies of the same stellar mass , with ssfrs larger by an order of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    the above remarkable recent progress in studies of stars in high-@xmath18 galaxies has not been mirrored in studies of the other major constituent of galaxies , the neutral gas , the fuel for the star formation . in the local universe , this gas is best probed with emission studies in the hi  21 cm  line .",
    "unfortunately , the weakness of the hi  21 cm  transition has meant that the highest redshift at which it has so far been detected in emission is @xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of the molecular component ,",
    "studies of co in emission at @xmath20 have indeed found evidence for massive reservoirs of molecular gas ( @xmath21 , comparable to the stellar mass ) in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , co is only a tracer of the bulk of the molecular gas , and the conversion factor from the co line luminosity to molecular gas mass is known to depend on galaxy type , varying by a factor of @xmath22 between starburst and spiral galaxies , and by larger factors in low - metallicity galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "overall , the situation today is that little is known about the neutral gas , especially the atomic component , in high-@xmath18 star - forming galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , even very deep integrations with today s best radio telescopes will only be able to detect hi  21 cm  emission from even the most massive galaxies ( @xmath23 ) out to relatively low redshifts , @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; detecting hi  21 cm  emission from individual galaxies at @xmath25 will need the large collecting area of the square kilometre array .",
    "however , information can be obtained about the _",
    "average _ gas properties of high-@xmath18 galaxies by co - adding ( `` stacking '' ) the hi  21 cm  emission signals of a large number of galaxies with known redshifts that lie within the primary beam of the radio telescope but that are too faint to be detected individually @xcite .",
    "such hi  21 cm  stacking can be used to infer the average hi  mass of the galaxies and the cosmological mass density in neutral gas in these systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one can also determine average properties of the galaxy sample , including the dependence of the gas mass on various attributes ( e.g. sfr , stellar mass , environment , and redshift ) , the average tully - fisher relation , etc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stacking of the hi  21 cm  spectra of individual galaxies with known redshifts , obtained using radio interferometry , has so far only been carried out at low redshifts , @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this has been extended to slightly higher redshifts , @xmath27 , via cross - correlation of single - dish hi  21 cm  intensity maps with deep optical images @xcite . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) results from the first hi  21 cm  stacking experiment at @xmath6 , obtaining tight constraints on the average gas mass of star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "the stacking approach critically requires a large sample of galaxies with accurately known redshifts in the target field .",
    "this is a significant restriction when selecting fields for searches for hi  21 cm  emission at @xmath28 , as this is the `` redshift desert '' where the bright optical lines ( e.g. h@xmath11 , oii , h@xmath29 ) that are typically used to identify galaxies are redshifted to wavelengths @xmath30   , into regions full of night - sky lines .",
    "most spectroscopic galaxy samples in deep fields are hence dominated by galaxies at @xmath31 , or at @xmath32 .",
    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey is unique in this regard as its redshift coverage extends out to @xmath33 @xcite , due to the use of the high spectral resolution ( @xmath34 ) mode of the deimos spectrograph on the keck - ii telescope , allowing the clear identification of the oii@xmath35 doublet out to @xmath33 .",
    "the deep2 survey covers four fields with a total areal coverage of 2.8  deg.@xmath36 , and has yielded accurate redshifts for 38,000 massive galaxies in the redshift range @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "a few thousand galaxies lie at @xmath38 , for which the hi  21 cm  line is redshifted to @xmath39  mhz , i.e. into the gmrt 610  mhz band .",
    "this picks out the deep2 survey fields as the ideal targets for a gmrt search for hi  21 cm  emission at @xmath8 .",
    "three of the deep2 fields are of size @xmath40 , each consisting of three sub - fields of size @xmath41 , while the fourth , the extended groth strip ( egs ) , is of size @xmath42 .",
    "the size of the sub - fields of the first three deep2 fields are well - matched to the size of the gmrt primary beam at 610  mhz , which has a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath43 .",
    "hence , although the egs has excellent ancillary multi - wavelength information , we chose to focus on the deep2 sub - fields 21 , 22 , 31/32 and 32/33 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all with full spectroscopic coverage , for the present gmrt pilot survey .",
    "]    we used the gmrt 610  mhz receivers to observe the four deep2 sub - fields in 2011 november ( sub - fields 21 and 22 , with pointing centers of ra=16h48m00.0s , dec=+34d5600.0 `` and ra=16h51m00.0s , dec=+34d5600.0 '' , respectively ) and 2012 october and november ( pointing midway between sub - fields 31 and 32 , and 32 and 33 , with pointing centers of ra=23h28m00.0s , dec=+00d0900.0 `` and ra=23h32m00.0s , dec=+00d0900.0 '' , respectively ) .",
    "a bandwidth of 33.33 mhz , sub - divided into 512 channels , was used for all observations , with 30 antennas , and the gmrt software backend as the correlator .",
    "the frequency coverage was @xmath44  mhz in 2011 and @xmath45  mhz in 2012 , implying a redshift coverage of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , with a velocity resolution of @xmath48  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the different frequency settings were used to test the possibility that radio frequency interference ( rfi ) might restrict the sensitivity in different parts of the gmrt 610  mhz band .",
    "observations of 3c286 and 3c48 were used to calibrate the flux density scale , and of 0022 + 002 and 1609 + 266 to calibrate the antenna gains and bandpasses .",
    "the total on - source times on each field ranged from 500minutes ( field 32 ) to 804minutes ( field 22 ) .",
    "the data were analysed in `` classic '' aips , using standard procedures . for each field , after initial data editing and calibration of the antenna bandpasses and gains , the visibility data were averaged to produce a dataset of spectral resolution @xmath49  mhz .",
    "accurate antenna - based gains were then derived via a self - calibration procedure , first iterating between 3-d imaging and phase - only self - calibration for a few rounds , followed by amplitude - and - phase self - calibration , 3-d imaging , and data editing .",
    "the procedure was repeated until the continuum image did not improve on additional self - calibration ; the continuum root - mean - square ( rms ) noise near the center of the primary beam is @xmath50jy in three of the gmrt pointings , but @xmath51jy for sub - field 22 , probably due to dynamic range issues due to bright sources at or below the half - power point of the primary beam .    for each field ,",
    "the task uvsub was then used to subtract the final image from the calibrated spectral - line visibilities , after which any residual continuum was subtracted via a linear fit to each visibility spectrum using the task uvlin .",
    "the residual visibilities were then shifted to the heliocentric frame , using the task cvel .",
    "polyhedral imaging was then used , with natural weighting , to produce wide - field spectral cubes , extending beyond the fwhm of the primary beam .",
    "the angular resolution of the final spectral cubes ranges from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , corresponding to a spatial size of @xmath54  kpc at @xmath55-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath56cdm ) cosmology , with @xmath57  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite . ] .",
    "we stacked the hi  21 cm  spectra of all deep2 galaxies lying within the fwhm of the gmrt primary beam and with accurately known redshifts ( redshift quality @xmath60 in the deep2 catalog ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that shift the hi  21 cm  line into the observed band for each target field .",
    "we initially excluded 20 channels from each edge of the observing band , where the sensitivity is significantly lower than in the band center .",
    "next , in order to have sufficient spectral baseline around any putative stacked spectral feature , we only considered galaxies with redshifts @xmath61  km  s@xmath4 from the edges of the retained frequency range .",
    "this yielded @xmath62 galaxies in the four gmrt pointings , with a total of 868  galaxies .",
    "hi  21 cm  spectra were obtained by taking a cut through the different spectral cubes at the location of each galaxy .",
    "a second - order baseline was fit to each spectrum and subtracted out to remove any residual curvature , and each spectrum was then scaled to account for the location of the galaxy within the gmrt primary beam .",
    "the distribution of spectral rms noise values per @xmath48  km  s@xmath4 channel for the different spectra , after the above primary beam correction , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] ; the rms noise at the center of each field is @xmath63jy per @xmath48  km  s@xmath4 channel .",
    "each spectrum was tested for gaussianity , via both the kolmogorov - smirnov rank-1 ( k - s ) and anderson - darling ( a - d ) tests ; 11 spectra found to have p - values @xmath64 in the a - d test were excluded from the stacking ( note that retaining these spectra does not significantly affect our results ) .",
    "the hi  21 cm  spectrum for each retained galaxy was next shifted to its rest frame and then interpolated onto a single velocity axis , before the spectra of each field were optimally co - added with weights determined from their rms noise values ( after the primary beam correction ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : rms ] ) to produce the final stacked spectrum for each field .",
    "these four spectra were then co - added , again with appropriate weights based on their rms noise values , and a second - order baseline subtracted out from the result , to produce the final stacked hi  21 cm  spectrum .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spc][a ] and has an rms noise of @xmath65jy per @xmath48  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in a search for line emission is maximized on smoothing the spectrum to a resolution equal to the line fwhm .",
    "we hence searched for hi  21 cm  emission in the stacked spectrum after smoothing to , and resampling at , a range of velocity resolutions from @xmath66  km  s@xmath4 ; no statistically significant feature was detected at any resolution .",
    "[ fig : spc][b ] shows the spectrum smoothed to , and resampled at , a resolution of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ; this has an rms noise of @xmath67jy and shows no evidence for hi  21 cm  emission .",
    "the @xmath1 upper limit on the strength of hi  21 cm  emission in the final spectrum at a resolution of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  can be used to derive a limit on the average hi  mass of the 857 stacked galaxies .",
    "however , our estimate of the rms noise on this spectrum is based on only 10 points .",
    "we hence used a bootstrap approach to obtain a more reliable estimate of the rms noise on the stacked spectrum , by stacking the 857 spectra after randomizing the galaxy redshifts ; this was done for 100 independent realizations and yielded an average rms noise of @xmath68jy per @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  channel .",
    "this estimate of the rms noise will be used in the later analysis .",
    "plotted as a function of redshift .",
    "the filled triangles are from hi  21 cm  emission surveys @xcite , the open squares from hi  21 cm  emission stacking at low redshifts @xcite , and the filled circles from absorption - selected galaxies , mgii absorbers at @xmath69 @xcite and damped lyman-@xmath11 absorbers at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the open star shows our new gmrt result , for blue star - forming galaxies at @xmath70 ; it is clear that this is significantly lower than the @xmath10 estimates at both @xmath71 and @xmath12 [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "[ fig : omega ] ]    the deep2 galaxy sample is selected at r - band , with a limiting r - magnitude of 24.1 @xcite .",
    "for the median redshift of @xmath72 of our 857 galaxies , this corresponds to selection at a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath73   .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the high-@xmath18 deep2 sample is hence highly biased towards star - forming galaxies in the blue cloud of the galaxy color - magnitude diagram ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our target galaxies are thus expected to predominantly be blue star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath74% of deep2 galaxies at all redshifts lie in clusters , with @xmath75% in the field and @xmath76% in small groups ; the fraction of cluster galaxies is even smaller for blue , star - forming galaxies .",
    "ram - pressure stripping of the hi  in our target galaxies ( as observed in nearby clusters , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is thus unlikely to be a serious issue .    for the assumed @xmath56cdm cosmology and the median redshift @xmath72 of our stacked galaxies , our non - detection of hi  21 cm  emission in the stacked spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : spc][b ] implies the @xmath1 upper limit @xmath77^{1/2}$ ] on the average hi  mass of the 857 stacked galaxies , where we have assumed a gaussian line shape with fwhm  @xmath78  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "note that the large spatial extent of the gmrt synthesized beam ( @xmath79  kpc  @xmath80  kpc at @xmath8 ) implies that it is very unlikely that we are resolving out the hi  21 cm  emission .",
    "this is the first direct constraint on the atomic gas mass of star - forming galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "stellar mass estimates are available for galaxies in two of our target fields ( 22 and 32 ) from k - band imaging @xcite , with an average stellar mass of @xmath81 . assuming that our other target galaxies have the same average stellar mass then gives an atomic gas mass fraction ( relative to stars , and after including a factor of 1.32 to account for the contribution of helium ) of @xmath7 , at @xmath1 significance .",
    "note that @xcite used co studies of star - forming galaxies at @xmath82 in the egs to infer an average cold molecular gas fraction relative to stars of @xmath83 , comparable to our upper limit on the atomic gas fraction .",
    "our results thus indicate that neutral gas in massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 is likely to be mostly in the molecular phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the deep2 galaxies were selected uniformly in r - band as a magnitude - limited sample @xcite , our non - detection of hi  21 cm  emission can be used to constrain the cosmological density of neutral gas in star - forming galaxies at @xmath70 .",
    "the fwhm of the gmrt primary beam at 627.1  mhz ( corresponding to the redshifted hi  21 cm  line frequency for @xmath84 ) is @xmath85 , implying a comoving area of @xmath86  mpc  @xmath87  mpc .",
    "our stacking analysis first excluded 20 edge channels , and then galaxies with redshifts @xmath88  km  s@xmath4 from the retained channels ; this implies an effective bandwidth of @xmath89  mhz centered at 627.1  mhz , i.e. a comoving line - of - sight distance of 177.8  mpc .",
    "the effective comoving volume of a single gmrt pointing is hence @xmath90  mpc@xmath91 .",
    "the upper limit to the cosmological mass density of hi  in star - forming galaxies is then @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the average number of deep2 galaxies in a single gmrt pointing .",

    "we include a factor of 1.32 for helium to obtain @xmath96 .",
    "[ fig : omega ] plots @xmath10 versus redshift from a variety of measurements at different redshifts .",
    "the figure shows that our @xmath1 upper limit to @xmath95 is significantly lower ( by a factor @xmath97 ) than the measured @xmath10 at both @xmath17 and @xmath12 .",
    "it thus appears that blue star - forming galaxies do not dominate the cosmological gas mass density in neutral atomic gas at @xmath8 .",
    "we note that it is possible that the most hi - rich galaxies at a given redshift do not dominate the star formation activity .",
    "for example , the `` hi  monsters '' of @xcite , with hi  masses @xmath98 at @xmath99 , have sfrs @xmath100/yr .",
    "our results thus do not rule out the possibility that @xmath10 at @xmath8 is dominated by massive , low - surface brightness galaxies with low sfrs .    in summary",

    "this is similar to the measured average cold molecular gas mass fraction in star - forming galaxies at @xmath82 , suggesting that the neutral gas in these galaxies may be mostly in the molecular phase .",
