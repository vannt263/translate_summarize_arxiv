    "by studying variable stars in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , henrietta leavitt discovered a linear relation between the pulsation period and magnitudes of @xmath2 cepheids , in the sense of that the brightest cepheids have longer periods @xcite .",
    "this correlation , commonly called period - luminosity ( pl ) relation , was lately renamed as the leavitt law ( ll ) in honor to its discoverer @xcite .",
    "this linear statistical correlation is a cornerstone in the measurement of the extragalactic distances using stellar standard candles .",
    "however , in order to obtain an accurate calibration of this relation , it is important to establish the effects of non - linearities , metallicity and companions on it , as it is mentioned by @xcite ; as well as other effects such as cepheids showing the hertzsprung progression and cepheids exhibiting changes in period .",
    "a brief literature review of these issues is presented below .",
    "* i ) the non - linearity effect : * the first works in this direction began twenty five years after the discovery by henrietta leavitt . in a study of the shape of the pl relation of nearby galaxies",
    ", kukarkin found that this relation has a break around @xmath3 d ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "three decades later , sandage & tammann ( 1968 , 1969 ) found evidence of curvature in the pl relation , and afterward , @xcite confirmed the break of the pl relation in @xmath3 d. @xcite confirmed again this result based on the statistical @xmath4-test . in the last years , the following studies have confirmed the non - linearity of the ll without proposing an explanation for it : the testimator method @xcite , the approaches of linear regression residuals and additive models @xcite , the multi - phase pl relations @xcite and the multiple least - squares regression @xcite .",
    "* ii ) the metallicity effect : * by using non - linear convective pulsating models , @xcite and @xcite studied synthetic multiband pl relations of populations of cepheids of different chemical compositions , uniformly distributed over the instability strip .",
    "the masses of these stars follow the law @xmath5 , and are distributed in the range of @xmath6 @xmath7 . for a wide range of log @xmath8 , those authors found clear evidence that the optical ll is better represented by a quadratic relationship than by a linear one , showing a dependence with the metallicity and the intrinsic width of the instability strip . for ir bands they showed",
    "that the ll is better fitted by a linear function showing a slightly dependence on the metallicity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found strong evidence in favor of the universality of the optical pl relation , in the metallicity range from @xmath9 dex to @xmath10 dex . @xcite and @xcite found that the slopes of the pl relations in _",
    "vi@xmath11 _ do not change significantly between the environments of the milky way and the lmc .",
    "* iii ) the companion effects : * physically bound companions to cepheids are difficult to detect at distances of tens of kpc . to produce a detectable effect on the light curve ,",
    "the eclipses should be deep enough and a significant number of points associated with the eclipses should be observed .",
    "the first condition is reached with an adequate combination of radius , luminosity and effective temperature of the primary and secondary stars , jointly with the appropriate inclination and mass ratio of the system .",
    "these eclipsing systems exhibit light curves similar to those of cepheids , showing besides dispersed points below them , which are a signal of the eclipses ( @xcite , fig . 7 ) .",
    "when the cepheid light curve is subtracted , it emerges a typical eclipsing signal ( soszyski et al .",
    "2008 , fig .",
    "@xcite claim to detect a few cepheids in eclipsing systems in the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds , using a random forest supervised algorithm over the macho catalog of variable stars .",
    "however , due to these variables do not show a clear period of eclipses , it is difficult to affirm that they are binaries .",
    "it is very likely that these stars are blended with near neighbors .",
    "@xcite reported few magellanic clouds cepheids that could be blended , and also others that could be members of binary systems .",
    "detection of cepheid systems whose light curves exhibit eclipsing variations is too important : if the cepheid is a member of a physical binary system , it is possible to determine dynamical masses , radii and distance with a very high accuracy . until now",
    ", spectroscopic studies of double - lined eclipsing binary systems in the lmc have been made by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) in the systems : ogle - lmc - cep-@xmath12 @xcite , ogle - lmc - cep-@xmath13 @xcite , ogle - lmc - cep-@xmath14 @xcite , ogle - lmc - cep-@xmath15 @xcite and ogle - lmc@xmath16 ( @xcite , @xcite ) a system detected in the ogle gaia south ecliptic pole field .    *",
    "iv ) the hertzsprung progression effect : * inspecting light curves of @xmath17 cepheids , @xcite found a relation between the position of a bump feature in the light curve and the pulsation period .",
    "later studies confirmed that this bump feature is present in the light and radial curves of fundamental - mode classical cepheids whose periods are in the range of @xmath18 d @xcite .",
    "this feature is present in the descending branch for pulsations in the range of @xmath19 d. for longer periods , this feature is observed in the ascending branch and disappears for periods longer than @xmath20 d ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude bump grows when the period increases , reaching its maximum value for periods near to the maximum light around @xmath21 d. for longer periods , the amplitude bump decreases until it vanishes @xcite .",
    "+ there are two models that explain some of the properties of the observed bump feature . the first one , called the echo mechanism , proposes radial - pressure waves generated in the he ii ionization region @xcite .",
    "the traveling inward wave is reflected in the core and reaches the surface one period later , leading to the formation of the bump @xcite .",
    "however , this model has two points to solve : the contradiction with the acoustic - ray formalism ( @xcite ; aikawa & whitney 1984 , 1985 ) and the difficulty of predicting adequately the christy wave velocity near to the stellar surface ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the second model , known as the resonance mechanism , proposes that the feature bump arises from a resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone @xcite .",
    "by using numerical simulations @xcite studied the nonlinear saturation of the acoustic modes excited by the @xmath22mechanism .",
    "they found that this @xmath23:@xmath24 resonance causes that the bump appears in the ascending branch for @xmath25 .    *",
    "v ) the changing period effect : * the long - term observations detect several thousand oscillation cycles for short period cepheids . this allows to determine , with very high accuracy , changing periods . for the long period cepheids , it is no possible to reach this accuracy , because the data have in the worse cases of sampling , tens of cycles .",
    "there are three scenarios explaining different characteristics of the period change rates .",
    "the first one proposes that the evolutionary changes on the stellar structure of cepheids crossing the instability strip are responsible of the period change rates ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the second one proposes that the presence of magnetic fields is a possible explanation for the random changing periods exhibited by some cepheids .",
    "the last one suggests that the amplitude and phase variations of cepheids are caused by an analogous to the blazhko effect , exhibited by rr lyr stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a few cepheids that could be exhibit this blazhko effect , being the number of these cepheids larger in the lmc than in the smc . + the period changes should produce a shift of the phase in the light curve , and as a consequence , a higher scatter in the light curve , detectable on years of observations .",
    "a study of @xmath26 lmc cepheids found period changes in @xmath27 of the fundamental mode , and in @xmath28 of the first overtone ( @xcite , table 3 ) . a visual inspection of the light curves of these ogle cepheids shows , for the most of them , a strong scatter of the points as a consequence of the shift phase .",
    "+ since there are a few studies about magnetic fields on cool radial pulsating stars , it is not clear if the nature of these magnetic fields are fossil or are produced as a consequence of the stellar pulsation @xcite .",
    "based on a solar - like magneto - convective cycle , @xcite could explain the observed period change rates of two short period cepheids : polaris and v473 lyr . as the existence of local magnetic fields on the surface of late - type stars causes spots @xcite , @xcite proposed that convective hot spots can be a possible explanation to the random changes in the pulsation period detected in the single cepheid observed by the kepler mission , v1154 cyg .",
    "+ the first detection of magnetic fields in variable stars was made on rr lyr @xcite .",
    "measurements of magnetic fields for cepheid stars began later on .",
    "in particular , for @xmath29 car and @xmath30 cyg there were reported values of @xmath31 g @xcite , and from @xmath32 g to @xmath33 g ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the spectropolarimetric works over the bright bump cepheid @xmath34 aql ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 d ) reported controversial results . while @xcite and @xcite measured periodic variations of the longitudinal magnetic field with an amplitude of tens of gauss , @xcite found a non - significant detection of the longitudinal magnetic field at a level of @xmath3 g. + in order to establish whether or not the effects previously described are influential on the ll , we make a study using statistical techniques .",
    "we start - off , in the second section , with a brief description of the lmc ll and the ogle - ii and ogle - iv cepheid data .",
    "the third section is dedicated to review the statistical theory of the linear regression analysis , relevant for this work .",
    "the fourth section presents the results of applying statistical models in order to obtain optical ll of the lmc and smc .",
    "finally , our main conclusions are given in the fifth section .",
    "ogle - ii and ogle - iv observations of cepheid variables of the lmc and smc galaxies were collected with the @xmath37-m warsaw telescope , at las campanas observatory , chile ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while ogle - ii fundamental mode cepheid catalogs contain 771 and 1319 stars for the lmc and smc , respectively , ogle - iv has a nearly complete collection ( 2429 and 2739 for the lmc and smc , respectively ) , covering practically the whole magellanic system area with the time baseline , a little more than five years .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the slope and zero point of the lmc ll in optical _ vi_-bands were computed by @xcite using ordinary least - squares ( ols ) regression , on ogle - ii fundamental - mode cepheids .",
    "points deviating by more than @xmath38 ( outliers ) were removed by applying the sigma - clipping algorithm @xcite .",
    "udalski realized that standard deviation of residuals of the lmc data was almost two times smaller than that of the smc .",
    "this greater dispersion is caused mainly by the spatial distribution of cepheids in the smc bar , whose thickness is placed along the line - of - sight with a typical depth of @xmath39 mag @xcite .",
    "these facts , and the manner in which the ll of the lmc is much better populated for periods longer than @xmath40 d , suggested udalski to adopt as the universal slope value the one obtained for the lmc , notwithstanding that the number of cepheids in the smc was around twice that of lmc . for ogle - iv lmc cepheids the slope and zero point of the ll were determined in analogous approach , but the smc slope was obtained independently , using only cepheids of this galaxy @xcite .",
    "+ with the aim to establish a possible statistical cause of the non - linearity of the ll , we use the dereddened sample of ogle - ii",
    ". fundamental mode cepheids belonging to the lmc and smc galaxies reported by @xcite and @xcite , as well as the nearly complete collection of ogle - iv magellanic clouds cepheids reported by @xcite .",
    "in this section we summarize the topics of the statistical theory of linear regression analysis , most relevant to this paper .",
    "we start explaining what the outliers and influential points are .",
    "then , we present the theory of ordinary least square method and the conditions to apply it .",
    "next , we describe the statistics tools to identify influential points . then , we present the specification test , which verifies if all variables involved in a statistical problem are adequately included and represented by a proposed model . following , we present the structural break test , which looks for unstable parameters . finally , we present the robust @xmath0-regression that allows to do a linear regression of data with no - gaussian error distribution . the @xmath1-regression is applied in order to get a high breakdown point and fit the models in presence of influential points that are outliers at the same time .",
    "an extended statistical discussion of these topics can be found in @xcite .",
    "some applications in the astronomy context can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most common method to estimate parameters in a linear regression model is ols , based on the gauss - markov theorem .",
    "the model is ( in matrix notation ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dependent variable vector , @xmath43 is the independent variables matrix , @xmath44 is the parameters vector and @xmath45 is the errors vector .",
    "this theorem states that the ols estimators are the best linear unbiased estimators if the expected value of the errors vector is zero ( @xmath46 ) , the variance of the errors is constant ( @xmath47 ) and the errors are uncorrelated",
    ". it can be shown @xcite that ols estimators ( @xmath48 ) are obtained from : @xmath49    notice that : @xmath50 is the nule vector , @xmath51 the identity matrix and @xmath52 indicates @xmath53 matrix is transposed .    once the model is fitted",
    "the adequacy must be checked .",
    "that is : i ) the error term @xmath45 has a constant variance @xmath54 .",
    "ii ) the errors are uncorrelated .",
    "these items are the gauss - markov theorem assumptions .",
    "iii ) the errors are normally distributed .",
    "this is very important for making hypothesis testing and estimating confidence intervals .",
    "iv ) all the observations have approximately the same weight .",
    "it refers to the fact that it is not desirable that model estimators depend more on few observations than on the majority of them .",
    "this could happen if some observations , called influential points , have a disproportional impact in the ols estimations .",
    "v ) there is no specification problems in the model and there is not a structural break , i.e. the parameters are stable .",
    "it refers to the correct functional form of the model .    after fitting the model",
    ", a residual analysis is made to verify its adequacy .",
    "since the residuals are the difference between the original observed values and their fits , they also measure the variability of the dependent variable which is not explained by the model .",
    "therefore , any violations to the assumptions can be detected by analyzing model residuals .",
    "mainly the analysis on residuals is looking for evidence of : i ) errors come from a distribution with heavier tails than normal .",
    "large departures from normality in the error distribution mean that the _ f- _ and _ t- _ test are not longer valid as well as the confidence interval estimations .",
    "ii ) heteroskedasticity , meaning that the errors do not have constant variance .",
    "iii ) influential points .",
    "iv ) specification problems .",
    "v ) autocorrelated errors . in this study",
    "it is not necessary to check if errors are correlated because the data are not time dependent , i.e. they come from a cross - section in the statistical sense .",
    "+ for checking the error distribution a normal probability quantil - quantil ( @xmath55 ) plot is used .",
    "if all the residuals lie along a line , it means that they come from a normal distribution . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this plot shows if the distribution has heavier or lighter tails or if it is skewed compared to the normal distribution .    for checking the assumption that errors have constant variance ( homoskedasticity ) the white s test @xcite",
    "is used in the following equation : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the residual from the linear regression defined as : @xmath58 this test does not make the assumption that errors come from a normal distribution .",
    "its null hypothesis is that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "since the pl relation can be modeled as a simple linear regression , the test uses the auxiliary model given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the error term and @xmath63 is the number of stars .",
    "it can be shown that white s statistic @xmath64 is asymptotic distributed as @xmath65 with g-1 degrees of freedom , where @xmath63 is the number of observations and @xmath66 is the regression coefficient of determination of the equation ( [ eq5 ] ) . because the auxiliary model ( equation [ eq5 ] ) has three parameters ( @xmath67 ) the @xmath65 has @xmath23 degrees of freedom .",
    "+      outliers are points that have an unusual behavior .",
    "let us imagine a scatter plot , outliers are data points that unusually are located out of the pattern or far from the data cloud .",
    "on the other hand , influential points are those data that have a disproportional impact on ols estimators ( slope and zero point ) . as a result , the model estimators depend more on them than on the majority of data .",
    "let us imagine the scatter plot again , a regression line is fitted with all points .",
    "then we delete a point and fit the regression line once more .",
    "if the regression line obtained after removing the point changes a lot ; the deleted observation is an influential point .",
    "what is a lot ?",
    "statistics helps us in this decision , as we shall describe later .",
    "now , let us imagine the scatter diagram with a far point from the cloud of data points , but located along the regression line . if we delete it , the regression line will not change .",
    "therefore , the point is an outlier but not an influential point , because it affects the @xmath68 coefficient and the ols estimator standard errors , but not the ols regression estimators . on the contrary , if the outlier affects the regression coefficient estimators it is also an influential point .",
    "finally , let us imagine that the point is not an outlier ; however , after deleting it , the new regression fitted - line is very different from the obtained with it .",
    "this means that it is an influential point .",
    "in general , influential points can or can not be outliers .",
    "+ * detection of influential points : * in order to look for influential points cook s distance , _ dffits , dfbetas , covratio _ statistics are commonly used @xcite .",
    "the first of them is defined as follows : @xmath69 basically , it measures the square distance between the ols @xmath44 estimate , based on all observations and ols @xmath70 estimate obtained after deleting the @xmath71 observation , where @xmath72 in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) is the number of parameters in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , i.e. the number of independent variables plus the zero point .",
    "moreover , @xmath73 is an estimate of the mean square error , defined as follows : @xmath74 observations with large cook s distance affect ols estimates of @xmath44 . to know what is a large cook s distance , @xmath75",
    "is compared to the @xmath76 distribution @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath71 observation has a @xmath77 , it is considered an influential point .",
    "_ dffits _ measures how large is the influence of the @xmath71 observation on its own estimated @xmath78 . in other words , it shows how many standard deviations @xmath78 change due to delete the @xmath71 observation .",
    "it is defined as follows :    @xmath79    @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the fitted values and the standard deviation respectively , obtained without the @xmath71 observation .",
    "the term @xmath82 is the @xmath71 diagonal element of the matrix @xmath83 that is defined as follows : @xmath84    the term @xmath85 is the amount of leverage that the @xmath71 observation has on the @xmath86 fitted value .",
    "a point is considerate influential when @xmath87 . for complementary explanations and references about _ dffits _ and the @xmath88 matrix see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other statistics that detects influential points is _",
    "dfbetas_. it indicates how much effect has the @xmath71 observation on each @xmath89 , measured in standard deviation units . in order to apply it , the coefficient estimators of @xmath89 obtained using all observations",
    "are compared with the coefficient estimators computed excluding the @xmath71 observation ( @xmath90 ) . as a result , a measure for each @xmath89 is obtained .",
    "the _ dfbetas _",
    "statistics is defined as follows : @xmath91    where @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 is the @xmath86 diagonal element of the matrix @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the square root of the regression mean square error fitted without the @xmath71 observation .",
    "an observation is considered an influential point if @xmath96 .",
    "+ the last statistics used to detect influential points is _ covratio _ , that measures how the covariance matrix is affected by the @xmath71 observation .",
    "it compares the generalized variance of the parameters estimators , obtained without the @xmath71 observation , with that obtained using all observations .",
    "+ the variance - covariance matrix of parameters estimators with all observations is : @xmath97    the generalized variance is the determinant of the equation ( [ eq11 ] ) : @xmath98    given this , _ covratio _ is defined as follows : @xmath99    the @xmath71 observation is considered influential if its _ covratio _ lies out of the following interval @xmath100 , where @xmath72 is the number of parameters in the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) and @xmath63 is the total number of observations .",
    "the reported ll in this work are obtained by rejecting from the sample the influential points , and cepheids exhibiting the communalities , explained later .",
    "however , two questions arise that require detailed answers : why is it important to identify these influential points and give them an statistical treatment ? why is it necessary to apply robust techniques to make a linear regression instead of applying a well - known algorithm as sigma - clipping ? in the next paragraphs , we answer these questions , illustrating the associated statistical problem .",
    "outliers are observations with anomalous behavior .",
    "when they are caused by human errors or instrumental failures , they can be recognized and excluded from the analysis .",
    "moreover , they can be rejected from the analysis only if there are strong non - statistical reasons that support such decision . in this work it is possible to reject them based on astronomical reasons .",
    "however , the usual practice of deleting outliers without making a further analysis looking for reasons that could explain their behavior , could imply serious consequences in the estimators precision , because they are adjusted artificially @xcite .    as a result , when there are not astronomical reasons that support excluding those points and/or there are influential points , robust estimation methods are needed .",
    "to validate that there is no evidence of specification errors in the model , we use tests to look if a non - linear combination of the fitted values are significant to explain the response variable .",
    "one of them is the ramsey s test given by the equations ( [ eq15 ] ) to ( [ eq17 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the other one , is a variant proposed by godfrey and orme that uses only the model given by equation ( [ eq15 ] ) @xcite .",
    "these auxiliary models and their respectively hypotheses used in this work are the following : @xmath101    the null and alternative hypothesis are @xmath102 and @xmath103    @xmath104    the null and alternative hypothesis are @xmath105 and @xmath106    @xmath107    the null and alternative hypothesis are @xmath108 and @xmath109 : at least one @xmath110 ; @xmath111 . + if any of these tests are significant because there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis @xmath112 , then there is enough evidence of misspecification .",
    "in fact , it means that a non - linear combination of the fitted values are significant to explain the variability in the dependent variable , i.e the functional form is incorrect .",
    "+      to verify if there are structural breaks , dummy variables are used . before explaining what a dummy variable is , it is necessary to give a brief explanation about qualitative variables .",
    "qualitative or categorical variables are those that do not have a natural scale of measurement . in this study",
    "two categorical variables are used .",
    "the first variable indicates which data set the observation belongs to when data are divided in two sets , to make structural tests to the models .",
    "this variable has two categories : data set @xmath24 and data set @xmath23 .",
    "the second variable is the galaxy name where the cepheid is located , which also has two categories : lmc and smc .",
    "+ dummy variables are used to indicate which category from a qualitative variable the observations belong to .",
    "each dummy variable takes two possible values : @xmath24 if the observation belongs to the category that the dummy variable is representing , and @xmath113 if not .",
    "if a qualitative variable has @xmath114 categories , it can be represented by @xmath114 dummy variables , one for each category .    however , only @xmath115 dummy variables are used in the regression model . besides , it does not matter which @xmath115 dummy variables are used since @xmath116 matrix is the same , independently of which dummy variable is taken out to fit the model .",
    "in fact , dummy variables representing the categories of a qualitative variable are linked between each other because when one of them takes a value of @xmath24 for an observation , the others take @xmath113 for the same observation .",
    "therefore , when all the @xmath115 dummy variables in the model take a value of @xmath113 , they are representing the dummy variable that is no present in the model . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "+ the process of verifying the existence of structural breaks is made as follows : the data are divided in two data sets by dummy variables .",
    "then , a model that includes the dummy variables is estimated to verify if the estimated parameters associated with dummies are significant or not",
    ". if they are significant , the parameters are unstable , thus there are structural breaks .",
    "+ to contrast hypothesis the @xmath117value is used .",
    "it means the lowest level of significance that leads to reject null hypothesis when it is true .",
    "therefore , if @xmath117value is greater than the significance level , there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis . on the contrary , if the @xmath117value is less than or equal to the significance level there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative one , which means the test is significant .",
    "sometimes ols assumptions are not accomplished ; for example , errors have a distribution with heavier tails than normal distribution and/or there are influential points .",
    "an alternative to fit a linear model in these kinds of scenarios is a robust regression , in which the residuals can be defined as follows : @xmath118 it is convenient to scale the residuals by using median absolute deviation : @xmath119 therefore the scaled residuals @xmath120 can be expressed as follows : @xmath121 if scaled residuals are not dependent between them , and all of them have the same distribution @xmath122 , the maximum likelihood @xmath44 estimators are those that maximize the likelihood function : @xmath123 in @xcite is shown that this condition is equivalent to minimize the equation ( [ eq22 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a class of robust estimator that minimizes this equation is called @xmath0-estimator and the regression based on it is called @xmath0-regression .",
    "@xmath0 comes from maximum - likelihood since function @xmath124 is related to equation ( [ eq21 ] ) for a proper choice of the error distribution .    besides , @xmath124 weights the scaled residuals @xmath62 in the sum : @xmath125 there are more than one suggestion for @xmath124 in the literature , the function used in this work is the tukey s bi - square , with parameter equal to @xmath126 @xcite . for further information about this function and other choices",
    "see @xcite . to minimize the equation ( [ eq22 ] ) the first partial derivative of @xmath124",

    ", it is obtained : @xmath130 where @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 , otherwise is @xmath24 .",
    "+ the determination of @xmath0-estimator is an iterative process , thus , the @xmath0-estimator for @xmath44 is : @xmath134 this iterative process stops when a convergence criteria is reached , i.e. when the estimators change less than a preselected amount in the @xmath135 iteration .",
    "notice that the equation ( [ eq27 ] ) is the weighted least square estimator where @xmath136 is a diagonal @xmath137 matrix of weights whose elements are @xmath138 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a wider discussion .      in the context of @xmath0-regression",
    "it is important to check that there are no bad influential points , i.e. observations that are outliers in the * x * space and influential points at the same time . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath1-estimator @xcite should be used because it has a high breakdown point ( bdp ) . in a finite - sample",
    "the bdp is the smallest fraction of contaminated data causing a divergence of the estimator from the value that it would take if data were not contaminated @xcite .",
    "+ the @xmath1-estimator combines the asymptotic efficiency of @xmath0-estimator with the high bdp estimators such as @xmath139estimators and least treammed squares .",
    "@xmath1-regression is obtained in three steps .",
    "first , a high bdp parameter estimators model is calculated to compute the residuals of the model .",
    "second , based on residual computed in the previous step , a @xmath0-estimate of scale with high bdp is calculated . finally , the model parameters are estimated using @xmath0-estimators and the scale estimation computed in the previous step . +",
    "neither normal errors nor homoskedasticity are assumptions in @xmath0-regression and @xmath1-regression .",

    "using these communalities we perform a bi - dimensional classification of the cepheids in some of the following groups : light curves with small ( 1 ) , moderate ( 2 ) , or large ( 3 ) dispersion . and light curves whose morphological shapes are sinusoidal - like ( a ) , sawtooth - like ( b ) or exhibit bumps , i.e. showing the hertzsprung progression ( c ) .",
    "dispersion of light curves of cepheids classified as 2 and 3 seem to be caused in several cases by blending , since a visual inspection of the finding charts of these cepheids , shows neighbors near to the stars .",

    ".**morphological classification of ogle - ii cepheids * * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when the influential points are correlated with our bi - dimensional classification , an interesting fact arises : around one third of the lmc cepheids and one fifth of the smc cepheids , classified with a grade of dispersion moderate and large are influential points .",
    "taking this fact into account , and in order to avoid violations of ols assumptions , we propose the following hypothesis : if cepheids with light curves of moderate and large dispersion , exhibiting characteristics suggesting blending , bumps , eclipses and period changes , are excluded from the ols linear regression , and the remaining data do not present violations of ols assumptions , it is possible to affirm that a cause of non - linearities of the ll is due to the inclusion of a fraction of these stars , that despite to be cepheids are influential points . + for testing this hypothesis , we fit the models given by equations ( [ eq28 ] ) to ( [ eq30 ] ) by ols using only cepheids with small dispersion .",
    "the results confirm the hypothesis , as it will be described below .",
    "for this reason , we consider appropriate to summarize here the communalities of these influential cepheids :    \\i ) the scatter exhibited by light curves of some cepheids classified as a2 or a3 can be associated with phase shifts , suggesting changes in the pulsational period . this effect produces a dispersion of the mean magnitudes , which moves the locus cepheid in the pl relation .",
    "\\ii ) the b2 light curves exhibit a behavior that could be explained by period changes or blending effects .",
    "the dispersion of these light curves do not allow to directly establish which of these effects could be present in these types of cepheids . in this work it is not clear which of them is more likely to be the best explanation .",
    "however , this point is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "this interesting fact could be investigated in more detail in future works .",
    "a small fraction of the light curves classified as b3 have characteristics suggesting eclipses or blending . in the first case , the main effect of the companion on the pl relation is to move the cepheid locus .",
    "due to that , the total mean brightness out - of - eclipse includes the companion contribution , adding scatter in some cases up to @xmath165 mag .",
    ", as it was reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second case is more probable to occur , since a visual inspection of the finding charts of the b3 cepheids , shows that most of them are blended .",
    "\\iii ) light curves classified as c1 or c2 are bump cepheids , i.e. they exhibit the hertzsprung progression .",
    "the amplitude bump affects the cepheid mean magnitude .",
    "this effect is stronger for periods near to the maximum light , shifting the cepheid position in the pl relation .    in order to use the ols regression ,",
    "the white s test is applied .",
    "this test does not find enough evidence to reject its null hypothesis of homoskedasticity , with a @xmath150 of significance , since the @xmath117values associated with each model test are @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 for the lmc , and @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 for the smc , respectively .",

    "the ogle - ii models adequacy could be explained because only @xmath318 of cepheids in the lmc has intermediate and large dispersion .",
    "therefore , as cepheids with small dispersion are the largest fraction , excluding intermediate and large dispersion cepheids has no significant impact on the estimated slope value , because confidence interval for slope ( @xmath234 ) , showed in table [ tab6 ] , includes the slope estimation ( @xmath234 ) showed in table [ tab2 ]",
    ". moreover , lmc fitted models with all ogle - iv data have confidence intervals for slope that contain estimation obtained by using the models fitted with all ogle - ii data ( see @xmath234 values in table [ tab6 ] ) _ .",
    "+ _ on the other hand , there is enough evidence showing that smc models are not adequate . unlike lmc ,",
    "the largest fraction of ogle - ii smc data @xmath319 are intermediate and large dispersion cepheids ; as a result , when models are fitted with all data , those cepheids are majority in the sample .",
    "the presence of a large fraction of intermediate and large dispersion cepheids in the smc galaxy can be explained by the geometry of this galaxy , as it was discussed in the section @xmath320 .",
    "it is interesting that smc models improve when they are fitted with ogle - iv data because , despite of specification problems , there is not enough evidence of unstability of the slope parameter in both bands . _",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    by applying the traditional ols and robust statistical linear regression models to optical ogle - ii and ogle - iv data , it is possible to affirm that the problems of break and non - linearity of the ll disappear for the lmc when @xmath0- or @xmath1-regressions are used . in that case , the ll is obtained without slope breaks , as it is shown in equations ( [ eq76 ] ) and ( [ eq77a ] ) , and it is not needed to exclude or reject points from the data sample .",
    "the models in this case are adequate and do not present specification problems or structural breaks , except in the ogle - iv @xmath162-band , probably due to the lack of extinction correction among others causes .",
    "these facts allow to conclude that the non - linearity of the lmc ll is a consequence of using a non - adequate statistical method . + for the smc , despite to use the robust regressions , specification , structural breaks and adequacy problems are found .",
    "this could be caused in part by blending problems due to the geometry of this galaxy , that could be generating a large fraction of intermediate and large dispersion cepheids , as it was discussed in section @xmath320 .",
    "this astronomical reason seems to imply that cepheid variables in galaxies with elongated structures like this of the smc are not appropriate to fit a reliable ll . in particular , for the smc , we found that excluding the intermediate and large dispersion cepheids , i.e. stars that exhibit the communalities of influential cepheids , leads to avoid the adequacy and specification problems .",
    "this could be indicating that this kind of cepheids really has influence in the fitting of the ll for galaxies with similar geometry to this of the smc .",
    "however , from a statistical point of view , there is no reason to exclude these stars from the analysis .",
    "+ the ols method has violations to its assumptions for the lmc and smc galaxies , with ogle - ii and ogle - iv data , as it was discussed at the beginning of section @xmath321 .",
    "in particular , two important problems are worthy of mentioning here .",
    "the first one is the fact that rejecting outliers using the sigma - clipping algorithm is not adequate because the precision of the parameters is adjusted artificially , besides there are violations of ols assumptions . without strong non - statistical reasons to support the rejection of points ,",
    "this method is invalid in the ll linear regression context .",
    "the second problem is the presence of influential points , that implies the necessity to find communalities in them . in this work we found that a fraction of cepheids with a grade of moderate and large dispersion are influential points .",
    "the communalities exhibited by them suggest in their light curves bumps , i.e. cepheids showing the hertzsprung progression , or eclipsing variations , or evidence of period changes .",
    "the exclusion of these influential cepheids from the sample using ols regression was made to solve adequacy problems ; however , new influential points appear that imply again violations to the ols assumptions .",
    "+ although the obtained @xmath0-estimators ( slope and zero point ) and their respective confidence intervals include the ols estimators reported by @xcite , the relevance of using the @xmath0-estimators is that they allow to make a reliable statistical inference , since none of their assumptions are violated , unlike the ols estimations .",
    "+ when cepheids from the lmc and smc are combined to fit a single model , in each one of the @xmath224 and @xmath226bands , the linear relations remain to be valid , after deleting the cepheids already discussed .",
    "the @xmath0-model shows that each galaxy has its own regression line differing only in the zero point .",
    "this implies that the ogle - ii leavitt law is universal in the range of metallicities of the magellanic clouds . on the contrary , the combined model for @xmath11 shows",
    "that each galaxy has its own linear regression with the expected difference in zero point , but with unexpected difference in slope . this result has already been reported in the literature , but its causes are not yet clear .",
    "lmc models fitted by using all ogle - ii and ogle - iv data by @xmath1-regression are adequate , but ogle - iv @xmath226band has specification problems .",
    "these problems could be due to blending and the lack of extinction correction in these data .",
    "there is no evidence of unstability in their zero point and slope parameters . on the other hand , despite of the specification problems in smc models for ogle - ii and ogle - iv data , there is not enough evidence of unstability in the slope parameters when they are fitted with ogle - iv data that have more observations compared to ogle - ii .",
    "however , when ogle - iv data are split in @xmath307 d , there is evidence of two parallel regression lines .",
    "+ it is clear from our results that influential cepheids do not have an important effect on the ll for the lmc .",
    "however , they could have impact in the case of galaxies with similar geometry to this of the smc .",
    "the effect of these cepheids in the measurement of distances to these galaxies , will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "+ finally , based on the results of this work , we suggest to use the ll relations given by equations ( [ eq76 ] ) and ( [ eq77a ] ) as a universal law for the smc and lmc galaxies .",
    "we also suggest to use the slope and zero point for @xmath177-band , obtained for lmc using ogle - iv data , shown in table [ tab6 ] .",
    "for the smc using ogle - ii without the influential cepheids , we suggest to use the equations ( [ eq54a ] ) and ( [ eq55a ] ) .",
