    "the development of a statistical mechanics for granular matter and other jammed materials presents many difficulties .",
    "first , the macroscopic size of the constitutive particles forbids equilibrium thermalization of the system .",
    "second , the fact that energy is constantly dissipated via frictional interparticle forces further renders the problem outside the realm of equilibrium statistical mechanics . in the absence of energy conservation laws ,",
    "a new statistical approach is needed in order to describe the system properties . along this line of research , edwards @xcite has proposed to replace the energy by the volume as the conservative quantity of the system .",
    "then a canonical partition function of jammed states can be defined and a statistical mechanical analysis ensues .",
    "while it is always possible to measure the total volume of the system , it is unclear how to treat the volume fluctuations at the microscopic level .",
    "thus , it is still an open problem the definition of an analogous `` hamiltonian '' that describes the microstates of jammed matter .",
    "such a `` hamiltonian '' is called the volume function @xcite , denoted @xmath0 .",
    "the idea is to partition the granular material into @xmath1 elements and associate an additive volume function to them , @xmath2 , such that the total system volume , @xmath0 , is @xmath3 from a theoretical perspective , initial attempts to define the volume function involved modelling under mean - field approximations proposed by edwards @xcite not taking into account the contact network .",
    "the necessary definition in terms of the internal degrees of freedom has been pursued by ball and blumenfeld @xcite who have shown by an exact triangulation method that the volume defining each grain can be given in terms of the contact points using vectors constructed from them .",
    "the method consists of defining shortest loops of grains in contact with one another , thus defining the void space around a central grain .",
    "a simpler version for the volume function was also given by edwards as the area in 2d or volume in 3d encompassing the first coordination shell of the grains in contact @xcite .",
    "the resulting volume is the antisymmetric part of the fabric tensor , the significance of which is its appearance in the calculation of stress transmission through granular packings @xcite .",
    "this definition is only an approximation of the space available to each grain since there is an overlap of volumes for grains belonging to the same coordination shell .",
    "thus , it overestimates the total volume of the system : @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both definitions of @xmath2 in @xcite are proportional to the coordination number of the grain .",
    "this is in contrast to expectation since the free volume available to a grain should decrease as the number of contacts increase .",
    "indeed , this observation is corroborated by experimental studies of jammed granular matter using x - ray tomography @xcite to determine the volume per grain versus coordination number .",
    "based on the idea that the volume function represents a free volume available per grain , we introduce a new `` hamiltonian '' to describe the microstates of jammed matter .",
    "we analytically calculate the volume function and demonstrate that it is equal to the voronoi volume associated to each particle , partitioning the space into a set of regions , associating all grain centroids in each region to the closest grain centroid .",
    "even though the voronoi construction successfully tiles the system , its drawback in its use as a volume function was that , so far , there was no analytical formula to calculate it .",
    "our approach provides this formula in terms of the contact network .",
    "furthermore we introduce a theory of volume fluctuations to calculate a coarse - grained average volume function defined at the mesoscopic level that reduces the degrees of freedom to only the coordination number @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the volume function is inversely proportional to @xmath5 in agreement with the tomography experiments of @xcite .",
    "our analysis also provides an equation of state , relating volume with coordination number in the limit of fully random system .",
    "indeed , it predicts with good accuracy the limiting cases of random loose and random close packing fractions .",
    "our results allow construction of a statistical partition function from which macroscopic observables can be calculated .",
    "this case is treated in more detail in the second part of this work : jamming ii @xcite .",
    "this paper is the first installment in a series of papers devoted to different aspects of jammed matter and is the main theoretical contribution for the subsequent statistical mechanics approach .",
    "the present paper is an extended version of the supplementary information section i in @xcite .",
    "the outline is as follows : section [ hamiltonian ] details the development of the microscopic volume function in terms of the particle coordinates .",
    "the relation of this form with the voronoi volume of each particle is discussed in section [ voronoi - formula ] .",
    "section [ proba ] discusses the statistical theory to calculate the probability distribution of the voronoi volumes leading to the average mesoscopic volume function discussed in section [ meso ] .",
    "section [ test ] tests the assumptions of the theory and we finish with the outlook in section [ outlook ] .",
    "we start by defining a volume function for rigid spherical grains of equal size in terms of particle positions .",
    "the volume function represents the available volume to the particle with the constraint of fixed total system volume .",
    "since we are dealing with rigid jammed particles , the available free volume is in principle zero since the particle by definition can not move .",
    "however , we allow the particle to move by introducing a soft interparticle potential and then taking the limit of particle rigidity to infinity .",
    "the resulting volume is well - defined , representing the free volume associated with each grain in the jammed packing .",
    "we consider a rigid particle of radius @xmath6 jammed at position @xmath7 in contact with another particle at position @xmath8 such that @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ volumea ] ) . in order to calculate the volume associated with such a particle",
    "we allow it to move by introducing a generic interparticle soft - potential , @xmath10 , determined by an exponent @xmath11 governing the rigidity of the particles ( see below ) .",
    "a small energy threshold @xmath12 is introduced in order to drive the particle in a certain direction @xmath13 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ volumea ] . a small displacement @xmath14 of particle @xmath15 along the @xmath16 direction results in an increase of energy @xmath17 between particles @xmath15 and its neighbors :    @xmath18    where the sum is taken over all the neighbors of particle @xmath15 .",
    "the soft pair potential @xmath10 can be any repulsive function provided it approaches the hard sphere limit when the control parameter @xmath19 , implying @xmath20 [ a possible function is simply @xmath21 , the case @xmath22 corresponds to the hertz potential ] .",
    "this condition implies that    @xmath23    and therefore from eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , we obtain : @xmath24    we define the available volume to a grain , @xmath25 , under the energy threshold @xmath12 as : @xmath26 ds,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the dimension of the system , @xmath28 is an infinitesimal solid angle in @xmath27 dimensions , and the available volume @xmath25 is averaged over all the directions of the @xmath27 dimensional solid angle .",

    "the total volume is then the average over all directions @xmath16 .",
    "the proportionality constant in eq .",
    "( [ va ] ) can be determined because @xmath25 is equal to the volume of the grains , @xmath33 , when the coordination number @xmath34 , suggesting that , in this limit , @xmath35 for any @xmath16 .",
    "that is , @xmath36    for mono - disperse spherical particles , @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath38 where we have replaced @xmath39 for nearest neighbors in the last equation .",
    "this allows us to generalize the volume formula to satisfy additivity and relate it to the voronoi volume as shown below .",
    "equation ( [ vi ] ) is not additive , and is different from the voronoi volume since only contacting particles are considered in the calculation . strictly speaking , only at the limit when the coordination number @xmath34 , and all the geometrical constraints come from contacting particles , the volume function eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) converges to the voronoi volume .",
    "however , the formula becomes additive when considering all particles rather than the nearest neighbors in the calculation of the minimum integrand in eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) .",
    "this approach is justified since non - contact particles may contribute to the energy of deformation in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) .",
    "further , if the minimum in eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) is taken over all the particles in the packing , @xmath25 is exactly equal to the voronoi volume , which is obviously additive . in turn",
    "we provide a formula for the calculation of the voronoi volume in terms of particle positions , as shown next .",
    "first , we recall the definition of a voronoi cell as a convex polygon whose interior consists of all points which are closer to a given particle than to any other .    formally , the volume of the voronoi cell of particle @xmath15 can be calculated as ( see fig . [ volumeb ] ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance from particle @xmath15 to the boundary of its voronoi cell in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "note that this definition is valid whether the particle @xmath42 is in contact with @xmath15 or not .",
    "if we denote the distance from particle @xmath15 to any particle @xmath42 at @xmath16 direction as @xmath43 then @xmath41 is the minimum of @xmath44 over all the particles @xmath42 for any @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ volumeb ] ) .",
    "this leads to    @xmath46    substituting into eq .",
    "( [ vor0 ] ) , we prove that the voronoi volume is indeed the volume available per particle as calculated in eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) : @xmath47    formula ( [ vor1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath48 where we define the orientational volume for the @xmath15 particle in the @xmath16 direction as : @xmath49    let us recapitulate and recall the three volumes defined so far which are interrelated : the voronoi and the available volume which satisfy @xmath50 , and the orientational volume which satisfies @xmath51 .",
    "all the quantities are additive , thus they provide the total volume of the system : @xmath52 for isotropic packings , @xmath53 ( without the average over @xmath16 ) is also additive since the choice of orientation @xmath16 is arbitrary .",
    "thus , we obtain : @xmath54 this property reduces the calculations , since there is no need for an orientational average .",
    "we define the orientational free volume function as :    @xmath55    and the reduced orientational free volume function @xmath56 with its average value , @xmath57 , over the particles , @xmath15 , for isotropic systems as :    @xmath58    this average orientational volume function requires only averaging over the particles @xmath15 but not over @xmath16 .",
    "the more general form of eq . ( [ vor1 ] ) allows study of anisotropic systems , a case left to future work .",
    "we notice that the average of the orientational volume over the particles ( for a fixed @xmath16 ) is equal to the average of the voronoi volume over the particles : @xmath59 .    the relevance of eq .",
    "( [ vor1 ] ) is that :    _ ( i ) _ it provides a formula for the voronoi volume for any dimension in terms of particle positions @xmath7 .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ it suggests that the voronoi volume is the volume function of the system since it is indeed @xmath25 as calculated from an independent point of view .    _ ( iii ) _ it allows for the calculation of macroscopic observables via statistical mechanics",
    ". however , further analytical developments are difficult since :    _ ( i ) _ the volume function is a complicated non - local , not pair - wise function of the coordinates .    _",
    "( ii ) _ it requires the use of field - theoretical methods .    _",
    "( iii ) _ it can not be factorized into a single particle partition function , implying that there are intrinsic strong correlations in the system .",
    "such correlations are implicit in the global minimization in eq .",
    "( [ vor1 ] ) which , in practice , is restricted to a few coordination shells and defines a mesoscopic voronoi length scale , which will be of use below . to circumvent the above difficulties , we present a theory of volume fluctuations to coarse grain @xmath60 over this mesoscopic length scale .",
    "this coarsening reduces the degrees of freedom to one variable , the coordination number of the grains , and calculates the average mesoscopic volume function eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) amenable to statistical calculations .",
    "next , we develop a statistical theory for the probability to find a voronoi volume in order to calculate the mesoscopic volume function by averaging the single grain function like in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) . for a given grain , @xmath15",

    "we consider @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and we set @xmath64 for simplicity . while the form eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) is valid for any dimension , the following statistical theory differs for each dimension . in what follows we work in 3d .",
    "results in 2d and large dimension will be presented in future papers .",
    "we consider the minimal particle contributing to the voronoi volume along the @xmath16 direction at @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ volumec ] ) with    @xmath66    we call this particle , the voronoi particle .",
    "then the quantity to compute is the probability to find all the remaining particles in the packing at a distance larger than @xmath67 from particle @xmath15 along the @xmath16 direction .",
    "that is , we compute the inverse cumulative distribution function , denoted @xmath68 , to find all the grains @xmath42 with @xmath69 , and therefore not contributing to the voronoi volume .    in terms of fig .",
    "[ volumec]a , the minimal voronoi particle located at @xmath67 , determining the voronoi cell , defines an excluded volume , represented by the gray volume in the figure , where no other particle can be located ( otherwise they would contribute to the voronoi volume ) .",

    "the remaining balls are in the bulk and in contact with the ball @xmath15 .",
    "a crucial step in the calculation is to separate the distribution into two contributions : a contact term , @xmath85 , and a bulk term , @xmath86 .",
    "this separation is important because it allows one to obtain the dependence of the average volume function on the coordination number .",
    "the contact term naturally depends on the number of contacting particles @xmath5 , while the bulk term depends on the average @xmath57 . since @xmath68 represents the probability that all the balls in the packing except the voronoi ball are outside the grey volume in fig .",

    "we treat the general case of calculating the probability for @xmath1 particles in a system of volume @xmath94 to be outside a given volume @xmath95 when added at random . in 3d , this probability is nontrivial since the volume occupied by each ball in the packing should be greater than the size of the ball .",
    "however , this probability can be calculated exactly in the case of 1d in the large @xmath1 limit . in 1d",
    ", the distribution of possible arrangements of hard - rods corresponds to the distribution of ideal gas particles by removing the volume occupied by the size of the ball as we can see in fig . [",

    "a mapping is exact in 1d , implying an exponential distribution of the free volume .    the probability to locate one particle at random outside the volume @xmath95 in a system of volume @xmath94 is @xmath96 for @xmath1 independent particles , we obtain : @xmath97 we set @xmath98 and the particle density @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath100 in the limit of a large number of particles , @xmath101 , we obtain a boltzmann - like exponential distribution for the probability of @xmath1 particles to be outside a volume @xmath95 : @xmath102    while the above derivation is exact in 1d , the extension to higher dimensions is an approximation , since there exist additional geometrical constraints .",
    "even if there is a void with enough volume to be occupied by a particle ( the volume of the void is larger or equal than the size of the particle ) , the constraint imposed by the geometrical shape of the particle ( which does not exist in 1d ) might prevent the void from being occupied .",

    "we note that the mechanical coordination , @xmath154 , is not the same as the geometrical one , @xmath5 ( see @xcite for details ) , and an equation of state of jammed matter should be a relation between state variables , such as average global volume fraction @xmath159 and mechanical coordination number @xmath154 .",
    "however , it can be shown that in the limit of infinite compactivity , the mechanical coordination number @xmath154 is identical to the geometrical coordination number @xmath5 , and the equation of state in this case has the same form of eq .",
    "( [ phi4 ] ) .",
    "thus for now , it suffices to say that we can obtain the two packing limits from eq .",
    "( [ phi4 ] ) in the case of fully random systems of infinite compactivity .",
    "the experimental studies of @xcite on the free volume versus coordination number of grains in tomography studies of random packings of spheres support eq .",
    "( [ phi4 ] ) ( see fig . 6 in @xcite ) .      equation ( [ phi3 ] ) should be interpreted as representing quasiparticles with free volume @xmath57 and coordination number @xmath5 . when a grain jams in a packing , it interacts with other grains .",
    "the role of this interaction is assumed in the calculation of the volume function ( [ phi3 ] ) and is implicit in the coarse - graining procedure explained above .",
    "thus , the quasiparticles can be considered as particles in a self - consistent field of surrounding jammed matter . in the presence of this field ,",
    "the volume of the quasiparticles depends on the surrounding particles , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ phi3 ] ) .",
    "the assembly of quasiparticles can be regarded as a set of non - interacting particles ( when the number of elementary excitations is sufficiently low ) .",
    "the jammed system can be considered as an ideal gas of quasiparticles and a single particle partition function can be used to evaluate the ensemble .",
    "these ideas are exploited in the definition of the partition function leading to the solution of the phase diagram discussed in jamming ii @xcite .",
    "in this section , we wish to test some predictions and approximations of the theory and propose the necessary improvements where needed .",
    "the purpose of this calculation is , first , to evaluate the predictions of the theory regarding the inverse cumulative volume distributions , and , second , to test whether the background distribution is independent of the contact distribution by comparing @xmath160 with @xmath161 .",
    "it is important to note that the predictions of the mesoscopic theory refer to quasiparticles as discussed above .",
    "the quasiparticles of free volume eq .",
    "( [ phi3 ] ) of fix coordination number can be considered as the building blocks or elementary units of jammed matter . to properly study their properties and test the predictions and approximations of the present theory one should in principle isolate the behavior of the quasiparticles and study their statistical properties such as the distribution of volumes and their mean value as a function of coordination number .",
    "such a study is being carried out and may lead to a more precise solutions than the one presented in the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , in what follows we take an approximate numerical route and study the behavior of quasiparticles directly from computer generated packings with molecular dynamics . while such packings already contain the ensemble average of the quasiparticle",
    ", we argue that in some limits they could provide statistics for isolated quasiparticles , at least approximately .",
    "this is due to a result that needs to wait until jamming ii @xcite , where we find that for a system of frictionless packings there is a unique state of jamming at the mesoscopic level and therefore the compactivity and the ensemble average does not play a role , at least under the mesoscopic approximation developed here .",
    "therefore , below , we use frictionless packings in order to test the theory .",
    "we note , though , that the conclusions of this section remain approximative , waiting for a more precise study of the packings of fixed coordination number .",
    "we prepare a frictionless packing at the jamming transition with methods explained in jamming ii .",
    "the packing consists of 10,000 spherical particles interacting with hertz forces . in the simulation",
    ", we pick up a direction @xmath13 randomly , and collect @xmath162 and @xmath163 from the balls , as follows :    @xmath164    thus , for a given direction , we find two minimum values of @xmath67 independently as @xmath162 and @xmath163 over all particles in the packing .",
    "we then collect data for 400 different directions .",
    "the @xmath162 is only provided by the balls in the background , and @xmath163 is only provided by the balls in contact . from the probability density , we then calculate the cumulative probability to find a ball at position @xmath165 and @xmath166 such that @xmath167 .",
    "that is , we calculate the cumulative distribution of @xmath162 and @xmath163 individually , i.e. , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the inverse cumulative distributions are plotted fig .",
    "[ pbpc ] showing that the theory approximately captures the trend of these functions but deviations exist as well , especially for @xmath67 values larger than its average .",
    "the contact term @xmath85 is well approximated by the theory supporting the approximations involved in the calculation of the surface density term , eq .",
    "( [ sqrt3 ] ) .",
    "the background term shows deviations for larger @xmath67 ; for smaller @xmath67 the theory is not too far from simulations . from fig .",
    "[ pbpc ] we notice that @xmath161 is well reproduced by the theory up to a value of 10% of its peak value .",
    "it is important to note that the mesoscopic volume function , @xmath57 , is extracted from the mean value of @xmath170 as @xmath171 .",
    "while some deviations are found in the inverse cumulative distribution , we find that the average value of the volumes are well approximated by the theory . indeed , we find that the deviations from the theoretical probabilities for @xmath172 appear not to contribute significantly towards the average volume function .",
    "for instance , the packing in fig .",
    "[ pbpc ] has a volume fraction @xmath173 as measured from the particle positions .",
    "this value agrees with the average @xmath170 obtained from the prediction of the probability distribution @xmath68 .",
    "we find @xmath174 = 1.561 , then @xmath170 = @xmath175 and @xmath176 in agreement with the volume fraction of the entire packing obtained from the position of all the balls , @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the present theory gives a good approximation to the average voronoi volume needed for the mesoscopic volume function , even though the full distribution presents deviations from the theory . in order to capture all the moments of the distribution",
    "a more refined theory is needed .",
    "such a theory will include the corrections to the exponential forms of @xmath87 and @xmath85 and their correlations .",
    "the main result of the mesoscopic theory , being the average voronoi volume decreasing with the number of contacts , is not affected by the assumptions of the theory for the full probability distribution .",
    "the correlations between the contact and bulk term are quantified by comparing @xmath178 with @xmath161 in fig .",
    "[ pbpc ] . from the figure",
    "we see that below and around the mean @xmath179 , the full distribution is close to the theoretical result while deviations appear for larger @xmath67 .",
    "further testing of the existence of correlations between @xmath87 and @xmath85 is obtained by calculating the product - moment coefficient of pearson s correlation as follows .",
    "the pearson s coefficient is :    @xmath180    where @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 .",
    "we find that the pearson coefficient @xmath184 is close to zero , meaning that the correlations between @xmath110 and @xmath109 are weak .",
    "the present numerical results imply that the current assumptions of the theory are reasonable .",
    "the conclusions are that while the cumulative distributions present deviations from the theory in their tails , the average value of the voronoi volumes are well captured by the approximations of the theory , therefore providing an accurate value for the volume function .",
    "more importantly , the present approach indicates a way to improve the theory to provide more accurate results .",
    "our current studies indicate that an exact solution of the distribution , @xmath68 , may be possible up to the second coordination shell of particles , for a fixed z - ensemble . due to the fact that the range of voronoi cell is finite , it is possible to work out a description for the finite , but large , number of degrees of freedom for both disordered and ordered packings through computational linear programming , in principle .",
    "this approach is related to the hales proof of the kepler conjecture @xcite .",
    "the present theory is a mean - field version in terms of the restricted description of the disordered packings , which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the original problem in order to write down the analytic form of the volume function in reasonable agreement with known values of rcp and rlp .",
    "the present approximations of the theory are further supported by agreement between the obtained form of the volume function and the empirical findings of the experiments of @xcite . in a future paper",
    "we will present a more exact theory of the volume fluctuations capturing not only the mean value but also higher moments .",
    "it is of interest to test the formula eq .",
    "( [ phi3 ] ) with the well - known example of the fcc lattice at @xmath185 to assess the approximations of the theory . at this limiting number of neighbors the entire class of attainable orientational voronoi cells",
    "have volumes in a very narrow range around @xmath186 which is larger than the prediction from eq .",
    "( [ phi3 ] ) .",
    "the free volume of the fcc voronoi cell is @xmath187 while the mesoscopic volume function for @xmath185 gives @xmath188 , below the real value .",
    "we explain this discrepancy since the current theory is developed under the assumption of isotropic packings .",
    "isotropic packings are explicitly taken into account in the theory considering the orientational voronoi volume @xmath53 ( along a direction @xmath189 ) as a simplification of the full voronoi volume , @xmath190 .",
    "such a simplification is meaningful for isotropic packings but fails for anisotropic or ordered packings . indeed ,",
    "in the case of packings with strong angular correlations , the `` weak - coupling '' hypothesis employed here does not work well .",
    "the extension of the current theory to anisotropic packings , such as the fcc lattice at @xmath185 , can be carried out , but remains outside of the scope of the present work . in this case , the full voronoi volume of eq .",
    "( [ vor1 ] ) must be used .",
    "eventually a volume function that accounts for disordered and ordered packings is very important .",
    "this volume function could test the existence of phase transition between the ordered and disordered phases .",
    "the theory we propose here is a quasiparticle version in terms of the restricted description of the disordered packings , which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the original problem in order to write down the analytic form of the volume function .",
    "the fact that eq . ( [ phi3 ] )",
    "does not predict correctly the volume of fcc but does predict correctly the volume of rcp raises the interesting possibility that there could be a phase transition at rcp , an intriguing possibility which is being explored at the moment .",
    "in summary , we present a plausible volume function describing the states of jammed matter . the definition of @xmath2 is purely geometrical and , therefore , can be extended to unjammed systems such as colloids at lower concentrations . in its microscopic definition ,",
    "the volume function is shown to be the voronoi volume per particle , and an analytical formula is derived for it .",
    "however this form is still intractable in a statistical mechanics analysis .",
    "we then develop a mesoscopic version of @xmath2 involving coarse graining over a few particles that reduces the degrees of freedom to a single variable , @xmath5 .",
    "this renders the problem within the reach of analytical calculations .",
    "the significance of our results is that they allow the development of a statistical mechanics to predict the observables by using the volume function in a boltzmann - like probability distribution of states @xcite when the analysis is supplemented by the jamming condition a la alexander @xcite ; which we propose in @xcite to be the isostatic condition for rigid particles ."
