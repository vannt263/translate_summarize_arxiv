    "topological transport phenomena have been attracting a great deal of interest , because they exhibit universal properties that are insensitive to perturbations and independent of material details .",
    "a classical example of such a transport phenomenon is the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) effect in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems , first discovered in 1980 ,  @xcite which is characterized by an integer quantization of the hall conductivity in unit of @xmath2 .",
    "the iqh effect has been observed in a large variety of materials , ranging from traditional semiconductors , to oxides ,  @xcite graphene ,  @xcite and topological insulators ( tis ) .",
    "@xcite laughlin  @xcite interpreted the iqh effect in terms of an adiabatic charge pump .",
    "thouless , kohmoto , nightingale , and nijs  @xcite established a relation between the quantized hall conductivity of the iqh system and a topological invariant , the first chern number .",
    "thouless and niu  @xcite also related the amount of charge pumped in a 1d charge pump to the chern number .",
    "a variant of the iqh effect , the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect , was proposed recently ,  @xcite which has been experimentally realized in hgte quantum wells  @xcite and inas / gasb bilayers .",
    "@xcite extension of the idea of the qsh effect has led to the discovery of 3d tis .",
    "@xcite a qsh system , which is also called a 2d ti , has an insulating band gap in the bulk and a pair of gapless helical edge states at the sample boundary .",
    "when the electron spin is conserved , a qsh system can be viewed as two independent iqh systems without landau levels .",
    "@xcite different from the charge , the spin does not obey a fundamental conservation law .",
    "in general , when the spin conservation is absent , unconventional topological invariants , either the @xmath3 index  @xcite or the spin chern numbers ,  @xcite are needed to describe the qsh systems . the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry",
    "is considered to be a prerequisite for the qsh effect , which protects both the @xmath3 index and gapless nature of the edge states .",
    "however , based upon the spin chern numbers , it was shown that the bulk topological properties remain intact even when the tr symmetry is broken .",
    "@xcite this finding evokes interest to pursue direct investigation and possibly utilization of the robust topological properties of the tis , besides using their symmetry - protected gapless edge states which are more fragile in realistic environments .    unlike the first chern number underlying the iqh systems , which is embedded into the hall conductivity , up to now the topological invariants in the tis",
    "have not been directly observable .",
    "several experimental methods were proposed , but have not been realized .",
    "one was to measure the topological magnetoelectric effect ,  @xcite for which experimental complexities exist .",
    "@xcite fu and kane  @xcite put forward an abstract 1d model , in which the spin pumping was related to the @xmath4 index in the limit of weak coupling .",
    "however , how this fictitious model could be implemented is still unknown .",
    "furthermore , from the viewpoint of application , generalization of the idea of the @xmath4 pump to higher dimension is meaningless , because according to the @xmath4 theory ,  @xcite only the states at the tr - invariant point of the brillouin zone can contribute to the spin pumping , and so the pumping rate can not be enhanced by increment of dimension . in a recent work ,  @xcite the more general case of finite coupling between the pump and electrode is investigated by using the scattering matrix method .",
    "it was found that the spin pumping in the model of fu and kane can survive finite scattering of magnetic impurities , and so may be attributed to the spin chern numbers rather than the @xmath3 index .",
    "some other authors  @xcite proposed to pump quantized charge through the helical edge states by precessing a magnet covering the edge of a 2d ti , so that the number of gapless edge channels can be counted through electrical measurement .",
    "this method is indirect , in the sense that the topological invariants are intrinsic properties of the bulk electron wavefunctions , which do not immediately determine the charge pumping in the edge channels .    here",
    "we predict an intriguing bulk topological pumping effect , directly driven by nonzero spin chern numbers , in a qsh system electrically modulated in adiabatic cycles . as a consequence of the topological spectral flows of the spin - polarized wannier functions ( spwfs ) in the bulk of the system",
    ", spin can be pumped into a nonmagnetic electrode continuously without net charge transfer .",
    "the total amount of spin pumped per cycle is proportional to the ( cross - section ) width of the sample , and insensitive to the material parameters and spin - mixing effect due to the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this electrical spin pump establishes a basis , on which spintronic applications taking advantage of the robust topological properties of the tis can be developed .",
    "especially , if a half - metallic electrode with spin polarization parallel ( or antiparallel ) to the @xmath5-axis is used , a quantized charge pumping conductivity , @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) , can be measured by electrical means , demonstrating a way to observe the spin chern numbers @xmath0 directly .",

    "width=288 ]    we now consider a system consisting of a pump for @xmath46 , an electrode for @xmath47 , and a potential barrier in between .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 has been given above , and @xmath50 is the hamiltonian of the electrode .",
    "a possible experimental setup for realizing this hamiltonian is explained in appendix a in more details . in the barrier region ,",
    "the term @xmath51 opens an insulating gap of size @xmath52 , which accounts for contact deficiencies between the pump and electrode .",
    "the crucial role of the nonzero spin chern numbers in the spin / charge pumping process can be visualized by using the spwfs , which were first introduced in ref .",
    "we construct a tight - binding hamiltonian for the effective 1d system at any given @xmath53 according to eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) , and diagonalize the total hamiltonian of the pump and electrode numerically . following the same procedure as calculating the spin chern numbers ,  @xcite the space occupied by electrons is partitioned into two spin sectors after diagonalizing the spin operator @xmath54 in the occupied space . by definition ,",
    "the states in the two spin sectors are essentially the maximally spin - polarized states",
    ". then we construct the wannier functions  @xcite for the spin - up and spin - down sectors , respectively , which are called the spwfs .    the evolution of the centers of mass of the spwfs for @xmath55 and @xmath56 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "we see that the wannier centers for the spin - up sector move right and those for the spin - down sector move left , each center shifting on average a lattice constant per cycle . within the adiabatic approximation , time @xmath57 plays the same role as the momentum of an additional dimension ,  @xcite namely , @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath53 is considered as a parameter , the evolution of the wannier functions of the effectively 1d system related to various @xmath59 with time @xmath60 can be understood from the static properties of a 2d system associated with various @xmath59 and @xmath61 . in the general theory ,  @xcite the relationship between the chern number and the spectral flows of the wannier functions in a 2d system has been established . according to this theory , the average displacement of each of the centers of the spwfs in the spin - up ( spin - down ) sector with changing @xmath61 ( or @xmath60 ) from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , in units of the lattice constant , must equal to the spin chern number @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . therefore , the nontrivial transfer of the spwfs observed in fig .",
    "1 is a direct manifestation of the nonzero spin chern numbers @xmath66 in the pump ( for @xmath67 ) .",
    "more interestingly , we see that such spectral flows can go across the finite barrier ( @xmath68 ) , and extend into the electrode , even though the barrier and electrode are topologically trivial .",
    "physically , because the system needs to recover its original eigenstates when each cycle ends , the nontrivial spectral flows of the spwfs in the ti need to constitute closed loops through formation of edge states at the boundary ,  @xcite or extend into the electrode .",
    "however , localized edge states can not exist at the finite barrier due to quantum tunneling effect , so the transfer of the spectral flows of the spwfs into the electrode occurs .",
    "this result will be further confirmed by direct calculation based upon the scattering matrix theory in the next section .",
    "the spwfs are just another equivalent representation of the occupied space , and so the counter spectral flows of the wannier centers in the two spin sectors represent the true movements of the electrons .",
    "if the rashba spin - orbit coupling were neglected , the wannier functions would be the eigenstates of @xmath69 .",
    "the nontrivial spectral flows indicate that at the given @xmath53 , in each cycle a spin - up electron goes from the pump into the electrode , and a spin - down electron moves oppositely .",
    "therefore , no net charge transfer occurs but a quantized spin of @xmath70 is pumped into the electrode . when the small rashba spin - orbit coupling is turned on , while the topological spectral flows remain intact , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , the spin polarizations of the wannier functions are no longer fully parallel to the @xmath5-axis , and may also vary with time . as a consequence ,",
    "the amount of spin pumped per cycle will deviate from the quantized value .",

    "this problem might not be significant in our pumping setup , where a much larger bulk sample of the ti can be used and the stray capacitances can be greatly reduced .",
