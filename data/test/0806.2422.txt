    "it is often mentioned that cosmology has entered into a new stage , so - called precision cosmology . of course , it is referring to developments of observational side . from theoretical point of view , however , we have not yet exhausted possible phenomenology on the order of a few percent . clearly , it is important to explore qualitatively new scenarios at the percent level . here , above all",
    ", we would like to point out that an inflationary model with a few percent of anisotropy yields significant consequences .",
    "indeed , a few percent does not mean the consequent effects are negligible .",
    "rather , it provides the leading component of the primordial gravitational waves in low scale inflationary models which are preferred by recent model construction in string theory   @xcite .",
    "one may feel that to seek the anisotropic inflation is against for the basics of the inflationary scenario .",
    "actually , the isotropy is the most robust property of inflation because of the cosmic no - hair theorem on the isotropization of bianchi universes  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to evade the cosmic no - hair theorem by incorporating the kalb - ramond action  @xcite or considering higher curvature theories of gravity  @xcite . in spite of the possibility",
    ", no one has attempted to construct any inflation models based on these ideas .",
    "the apparent other possibility is to break the lorentz invariance by introducing a condensation of vector field .",
    "the model proposed in  @xcite seems to be successful , however , it is known to be metastable  @xcite .",
    "a more natural possibility would be to realize a slow - roll phase of vector fields like as inflaton fields in chaotic inflationary scenarios .",
    "so far , it has been believed that it is difficult to make the vector field slow - roll without fine tuning  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the situation has changed by the discovery of slow - roll mechanism for the vector field due to non - minimally coupling  @xcite .",
    "hence , an apparent difficulty to construct the anisotropic inflationary scenario has been resolved . at this point , it is important to realize that both scalar and vector fields are ingredients of fundamental particle physics models .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider both scalar and vector fields exist during inflation . of course",
    ", the vector fields should be subdominant in the inflationary dynamics in order to reconcile the scenario with current observational data  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the vector field should be regarded as impurity .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of the vector impurity on observables should not be overlooked under the current precision cosmology .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an anisotropic inflation model with the vector impurity . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first concrete model which realizes anisotropic inflation , exits successfully to the isotropic standard universe , and provides a framework to discuss interesting phenomenology .",
    "we argue that the anisotropic inflation yields the statistical anisotropy in fluctuations . more importantly ,",
    "as is expected , the primordial gravitational waves could be induced from curvature perturbations through the anisotropic background .",
    "hence , we can expect the correlation between the curvature perturbations and the gravitational waves .",
    "in addition to these , we point out that linear polarization of the gravitational waves is created , which should be observed through cmb or direct interferometer observations .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model for the anisotropic inflation . in section iii , we analyze the system numerically and show that the anisotropic inflation is realized successfully . in section iv , using the slow - roll approximation , we obtain degrees of the anisotropy . in section v , we discuss phenomenology of the anisotropic inflation induced by the vector impurity .",
    "there , we emphasize that the gravitational waves can be produced through the anisotropy of the spacetime .",
    "the final section is devoted to the discussion .",
    "in this section , we derive the basic equations for the anisotropic inflationary scenario induced by the vector impurity .",
    "the set up is similar to the previous works   @xcite where scalar and vector fields are considered .",
    "however , backreaction of the vector field on the background dynamics is neglected there . here",
    ", we consider the backreaction and find it makes significant differences .",
    "we consider the following action for the background gravitational field , the scalar field @xmath0 and the non - minimally coupled massive vector field @xmath1 : @xmath2 \\ , \\label{action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the determinant of the metric , @xmath4 is the ricci scalar , @xmath5 is the scalar potential , @xmath6 is the mass of the vector field , and we have defined @xmath7 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath1 from above action : @xmath8 reduces @xmath9 in the case of @xmath10 because of antisymmetry of @xmath11 . as we find the vector field has only spatial components , we take @xmath12-axis in the direction of the vector , @xmath13 now , we will take the metric to be homogeneous but anisotropic bianchi type - i , i.e. @xmath14\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the lapse function . with this ansatz ,",

    "however , we can identify them by transforming the action ( [ action2 ] ) into the canonical form for @xmath20 .",
    "note also that if the effective mass squared of @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) is negative , the system will be tachyonic . to avoid this",

    "( [ eq : sigma+2 ] ) , this latter condition implies the amplitude of the vector field @xmath20 should be small . in this sense ,",
    "the vector field is a kind of impurity . in the limit , @xmath31 ,",
    "the above set of equations reduce to those of conventional inflation scenarios .",
    "also , taking look at eqs.([eq : n])-([eq : alpha ] ) , we see the deviation from the conventional slow - roll dynamics comes in of the order @xmath32 .",
    "although we have assumed the direction of the vector field does not change in time and considered only @xmath12-component of it for simplicity in eq .",
    "( [ vector ] ) , we could also incorporate other spatial components of the vector field . in that case",
    ", each component of the vector field obeys the similar equation as @xmath20 .",
    "the vector field turn out to start to rotate under arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "if the slow - roll conditions are satisfied for each , the vector will spiral down slowly .",
    "it is interesting to study the consequence of this complicated dynamics .",
    "however , we leave it for future work .",
    "in this section , we consider the evolution of the background spacetime driven by the scalar field @xmath0 , which we refer to as inflaton below , in the presence of the vector impurity .",
    "let us consider the universe after a sufficient expansion , @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward in this limit to integrate eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma- ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma+ ] ) to find @xmath34 we find that the anisotropy in @xmath35-@xmath36 plane , @xmath37 , will disappear .",
    "this is reminiscent of the comic no - hair theorem by wald  @xcite .",
    "however , as long as the vector field exists @xmath38 , the anisotropy in @xmath12 direction , @xmath39 , will still remain even if the universe undergoes a period of inflation . in the proof of the cosmic no - hair theorem for bianchi models ,",
    "the strong and dominant energy conditions are assumed .",
    "the reason why the anisotropy does not disappear in our model is that the non - minimal coupling breaks the strong energy condition .",

    "we set the initial value @xmath56 and determined @xmath57 using the constraint equation ( [ eq : n ] ) .",

    "both the mass and the non - minimal coupling play important roles for realizing the slow - roll .",
    "they affect the coefficient of @xmath20 in eq .",
    "in detail , the mass is important for the system to be stable and the non - minimal coupling cancels out the term @xmath59 in the effective mass squared of @xmath20 which enable the vector field to slow - roll .",

    "after the vector field goes to the minimum of its potential , the anisotropy disappears .",
    "the question of when the anisotropy disappears depends on the parameter @xmath48 and the initial amplitude of @xmath20 .",

    "the trajectories are almost same irrespective of the initial conditions for @xmath20 , and show the slow - roll phase .",
    "after slow - rolling , the inflaton field gets its damped oscillations .",

    "[ fig:2-a ] .",
    "we see the anisotropy remains sizable for some period and then dumped down to zero around @xmath66 irrespective of its initial condition .",
    "duration of this phase depends on the mass of the vector field and other parameters .",
    "we find larger initial condition for @xmath67 makes smaller anisotropy later .",
    "this can be understood from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) and ( [ attractor ] ) .",
    "suppose the initial anisotropy is larger than the value calculated from eq .",
    "( [ attractor ] ) using the initial data for @xmath68 , then the anisotropy has to decrease rapidly to adjust to the value of the attractor . during this phase , the effective mass in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) becomes large due to the term @xmath69 .",
    "then , the amplitude of the vector @xmath20 before entering the slow - roll phase decreases more than the case of smaller initial condition . from eq",
    "( [ attractor ] ) , the small amplitude of @xmath20 implies the small anisotropy during the slow - roll phase .",
    "thus , we have understood the behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig:2-b ] . in the case of the smaller initial anisotropy , the opposite happens .",
    "previously , the conventional inflationary scenario in bianchi type - i model has been considered  @xcite . in those cases",
    ", the anisotropy decays exponentially fast . in the recent works  @xcite",
    ", the anisotropic universe has been investigated in the context of dark energy .",
    "it would be interesting to apply our framework to the dark energy problem .",
    "now we consider the regime where both of the vector and the scalar field are slow - rolling .",
    "thanks to the slow - roll for the vector field which breaks strong energy condition , we have enough anisotropic era . for the reason explained in the previous section , we can exclude @xmath70 from the consideration . in the slow - roll approximation , we can write eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n])-([eq : x ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma+])-([eq : alpha ] ) as @xmath71 where we have ignored all second derivatives with respect to @xmath72 and square terms of the first derivatives with respect to @xmath72 except for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "since we are interested in the situation that the anisotropy is larger than the slow - roll parameter , we have kept the anisotropy @xmath74 in the above equations .",

    "( [ eq : n2 ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma+2 ] ) . hence , eq .  ( [ eq : n2 ] ) is redundant .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma+2 ] ) , we see @xmath20 should be small in order for the anisotropy to be small as is mentioned at the end of the section ii . eliminating @xmath67 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma+2 ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) , we can deduce the friedmann equation for this model @xmath76 note that if there is no scalar field , i.e. no potential , this equation tells us that @xmath77 , no matter what value the vector field takes .",
    "this contradicts the condition for the slow - roll : @xmath78 .",
    "thus we find that the inflation does not occur only with the vector field .    from eq .",

    "we are supposing the existence of inflaton and vector impurity .",
    "the inflation is driven by the inflaton . in the case of chaotic inflation , initial conditions for the inflaton",
    "are arbitrary as long as the energy of the inflaton does not exceed the planck energy .",
    "the larger initial amplitude for the inflaton gives the longer inflationary period .",
    "one of the initial conditions should correspond to our present universe .",
    "similarly , initial conditions for the vector field are arbitrary . however , as we have seen in section ii , the large amplitude of @xmath20 induces the tachyonic instability .",
    "hence , this does not correspond to our universe .",
    "the criterion for the stability condition @xmath81 in the slow - roll phase gives @xmath82 where we used @xmath83 and @xmath84 from eqs .",

    "we find that the inflaton field has the upper limit but still has enough parameter range for the anisotropic inflationary universe .",
    "for example , the parameters such as @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which we used in the numerical calculations , satisfy this condition .",
    "although mixing between tensor and scalar perturbations in anisotropic spacetime has been studied in the literature ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , there has been no concrete realization in the context of inflationary scenario . in this section",
    ", we would like to refresh various effects with our concrete anisotropic inflation model . here",
    ", we do not show the explicit numbers .",
    "however , from the structure of the background equations , we guess possible important consequences of vector impurity .",

    "detailed calculations will appear in the follow - up paper  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : sigma+2 ] ) . hence , if @xmath93 has a flat spectrum , the total spectrum should also be flat , even though it is anisotropic . in the case of curvaton scenario ,",
    "the scalar field @xmath90 decays after reheating and converts to curvature perturbations . for this case ,",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath90 gives cmb fluctuations directly . even for more complicated case of ours where inflaton also fluctuates",
    ", we expect the similar result as eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "this spectrum yields the anomaly in cmb observations . in paper  @xcite , it is pointed out that about 10@xmath98 deviation from the isotropic statistic can be detected by wmap and 2@xmath98 by planck . hence , the interesting number is around @xmath99 .",
    "in addition to this apparent effect , we can expect much more interesting ones .",
    "first of all , we should recall that the primordial gravitational waves are created quantum mechanically in the standard inflationary scenario .",
    "hence , their amplitude should be of the order of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 is the planck mass ) .",
    "on the other hand , here , we have another new component of tensor fluctuations induced by curvature perturbations through the anisotropic background expansion .",
    "this can be understood from the background equation ( [ eq : sigma+2 ] ) : @xmath102 = 0   \\ , \\label{key}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact @xmath103 and assumed @xmath20 is almost constant . if we define the following quantity which is supposed to be the gravitational wave : @xmath104 we find this is a gauge invariant quantity in the long wavelength limit .",
    "the background equation ( [ key ] ) implies @xmath105 is a conserved quantity , namely , @xmath106 . in the conventional isotropic case",
    ", this equation reduces to @xmath107 , which is equivalent to the conservation law for gravitational waves @xmath108 in the long wavelength limit . here",
    ", the polarized component of the transverse traceless tensor , @xmath109 , goes to @xmath110 in the long wavelength limit , that is , @xmath111 .",
    "now , we have an extra term @xmath112 in the gauge invariant gravitational waves , so @xmath113 itself does not conserve in the long wavelength limit . since the curvature perturbation is dominant during the inflation , the gauge invariant gravitational waves",
    "are generated first through @xmath112 which is supposed to be the curvature perturbation .",
    "thus , we have the relation @xmath114 . as the vector field goes to zero",
    ", @xmath110 starts to appear because of the conservation law .",
    "finally @xmath110 becomes dominant after @xmath20 vanishes .",
    "thus , we have the relation @xmath115 .",
    "because of the conservation law , we have @xmath116 , where the left hand side is evaluated at the final time and the right hand side is evaluated at the horizon crossing time for the mode with wave number @xmath117 . now , let us define the curvature perturbations , @xmath118 , which goes to @xmath112 in the long wavelength limit , that is , @xmath119 .",
    "then , we obtain the final result @xmath120 where the right hand side of eq .",

    "for the other polarization mode , we have the standard conservation law @xmath121 in the long wavelength limit . here",
    ", we have the correspondence @xmath122 .",
    "the above discussion tells us the scalar perturbation @xmath118 , which comes from the fluctuations of the trace part of metric ( [ metric ] ) , induces the tensor perturbation @xmath109 , which is the one of the traceless part of the metric .",
    "therefore , the tensor power spectrum @xmath123 should be related to the curvature power spectrum @xmath124 as @xmath125 where the relation ( [ main ] ) is used .",
    "the other power spectrum @xmath126 coming from @xmath127 has no correlation with the curvature perturbations because there is no conversion from the curvature perturbations in this case .",
    "in other words , we expect linear polarization in the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "this could be detected through cmb or directly by decigo  @xcite .    in papers",
    "@xcite , the gravitational waves generated from the second order perturbations have been studied .",
    "it should be stressed that the mechanism to produce the gravitational waves we are discussing is the first order effect in the anisotropic inflationary universe .",
    "the primordial fluctuations produced by the anisotropy are not the conventional ones created from quantum fluctuations directly .",
    "they are induced from the curvature perturbations created from quantum fluctuations .",
    "since the scalar perturbations are always larger than the tensor perturbations , this anisotropy induced mechanism is very efficient .",
    "this is an extremely important result . because this implies the existence of the primordial gravitational waves even in low scale inflationary scenarios .",
    "in fact , supposing that we detect the anisotropy @xmath128 , we would detect the primordial gravitational waves with the tensor - scalar ratio @xmath129 .",
    "since at least part of the tensor perturbations are induced from the curvature perturbations , there exists the correlation between the curvature and the tensor perturbations @xmath130 where we used the relation ( [ main ] ) .",
    "the correlation should give non - zero tb correlation at the 10@xmath98 level in the case of @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , the normalized correlation function @xmath131 does not vanish .",
    "surely , this should be searched observationally .",
    "although it is necessary to calculate precise numbers for prediction , we have uncovered the new possibility to generate the primordial gravitational waves on dimensional grounds based on the concrete anisotropic inflationary model .",
    "all of the above set of predictions are peculiar to the anisotropic inflation and hence can be regarded as signatures of the vector impurity .",
    "we have explored the cosmological implications of the vector impurity . it turned out that the vector impurity affects the cosmic no - hair theorem . consequently , the anisotropic accelerating universe is possible in the presence of the vector impurity . to prove it ,",
    "we have numerically solved the equations and shown the phase flow from which we see the anisotropic inflation successfully occurs and ends with oscillation .",
    "we found the explicit formula to determine the anisotropy of the inflationary universe by using the slow - roll approximation .",
    "we have also discussed possible consequences of the anisotropic inflation on the cosmological fluctuations . since rotational invariance",
    "is violated , the statistical isotropy of cmb temperature fluctuations can not be expected .",
    "it is intriguing to seek for the relation to the large scale anomaly discovered in cmb by wmap  @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the tensor perturbations could be induced from the curvature perturbations through the anisotropy of the background spacetime .",
    "one immediate consequence is the correlation between the curvature perturbations and the tensor perturbations .",
    "this correlation should be detected through the analysis of temperature - b - mode correlation in cmb .",
    "this new possibility implies , even in the low scale inflation , we can expect the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "this is an important result for future observational planning , because there has been worry that string cosmology tend to suggest the low scale inflation .",
    "moreover , because of the anisotropy , there might be linear polarization in the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "this polarization can be detected either through the cmb observations or direct interferometer observations .",
    "these predictions can be checked by future observations .    to make these predictions more precise ,",
    "we need to develop the perturbative analysis   @xcite .",
    "these are now under investigation  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the perturbations is much more complicated due to the violation of rotational invariance .",
    "however , since the anisotropic inflationary universe is smoothly connected to the isotropic radiation dominant phase , the interpretation of the results should be clear .",
