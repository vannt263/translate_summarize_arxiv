    "in equilibrium statistical mechanics , it has been accepted for a long time that the canonical ensemble provides , at least for the vast majority of systems , an adequate description of their properties .",
    "it could be argued that this essentially reduces the problem of understanding equilibrium properties to one of computation . on the other hand , for statistical mechanics far from equilibrium things are quite different : there are no laws corresponding to the gibbs ensembles in order to calculate the probabilities of a given configuration in general , and the situation is still extremely complex .    in this respect ,",
    "metastable states occupy a curiously intermediate position : they are generally viewed as equilibrium states , i.e.  as having a well - defined free energy , which is however distinct from that of the corresponding equilibrium state .",
    "nevertheless , it is also clear that such states eventually decay through a process of nucleation which brings the metastable state to a true equilibrium state which is physically quite different .",
    "traditionally , there have been many attempts to justify associating some equilibrium state to metastability through analytic continuation of the free energy .",
    "the oldest of these is , of course , the one due to van der waals , which indeed works perfectly for mean - field theory . for models with short - range interactions ,",
    "however , matters are more complicated : it has been shown @xcite that the free energy has an essential singularity at the coexistence curve .",
    "langer @xcite provided a way to define an appropriate analytical continuation across the existing cut and gave a clear picture of the cause of the singular behaviour : it is , in fact , due to the presence of the droplets which eventually nucleate the equilibrium phase .    in what follows",
    "we pursue a purely dynamical point of view of this problem .",
    "that is , we start from the main dynamical features of a metastable state and suggest a reasonable definition in terms of dynamic features alone .",
    "we then show that the metastable state thus defined can indeed be viewed as the restriction of the equilibrium ensemble onto a suitably defined subset . to achieve this goal , however , we must pay a ( considerable ) price : we must assume the system obeys very simplified dynamics , namely markov chains satisfying detailed balance .",
    "further , we shall concern ourselves strictly with finite systems and shall not take the thermodynamic limit . in part",
    "this is due to the fact that real difficulties arise when this limit is taken : since arbitrarily unlikely fluctuations will arise in arbitrarily short times in a sufficiently large system , it turns out that nucleation eventually becomes instantaneous in the thermodynamic limit , which is clearly an artefact .",
    "a typical way around this problem might be to take a simultaneous limit to systems of infinite size as well as to parameters ever closer to the coexistence curve .",
    "we shall instead simply study the finite , though large , system .",
    "the phenomenon of metastability may be described informally as follows ( see @xcite for a much fuller discussion along similar lines ) : a system is said to be in a metastable state if , upon starting the system in a certain subset of initial conditions , the system remains for a very long time in this limited subset of the set of all configurations , which is of negligible measure in equilibrium .",
    "further , this subset is macroscopically distinct from the equilibrium state .",
    "also , the return to equilibrium from a metastable state usually occurs in an abrupt fashion , i.e.  the macroscopic variables do not change slowly from their metastable values to their equilibrium values , but rather , they remain essentially constant and then suddenly relax to their equilibrium value , by some quick relaxation mechanism .",
    "the requirement that the time during which the system remains in a metastable state be `` large '' means simply that it is sufficient to allow the system to relax to some kind of pseudo - equilibrium state .",
    "thus , in a metastable state , the values of the macroscopic observables of interest will not show any systematic time - dependence , at least after some initial transient , the duration of which is much less than the decay time of the metastable state .",
    "the results presented in this work are derived for generic ergodic , acyclic markov processes satisfying detailed balance with respect to the gibbs measure .",
    "the typical system we have in mind is the finite kinetic 2d ising model , which we discuss in section iii .",
    "let us consider a markov chain on a finite state space @xmath0 with rates @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote states of @xmath0 .",
    "the master equation for the probability of the system being found in state @xmath2 is given by @xmath4 since the markov chain is assumed to be ergodic and acyclic @xcite , well - known theorems assert that the solution approaches a unique equilibrium @xmath5 .",
    "if we further assume that detailed balance holds , that is , @xmath6 then it is also well known that the operator @xmath7 defined in ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is self - adjoint with respect to the scalar product @xmath8 since the underlying vector space is finite - dimensional , it then follows that there is a complete orthonormal set of eigenvectors @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are by definition arranged in increasing order .",
    "the existence of an equilibrium distribution implies that @xmath12 and the corresponding @xmath13 is in fact the equilibrium distribution .",
    "all other @xmath11 are strictly positive .    using the orthonormality of the @xmath9 we can write @xmath14 implying that @xmath5 is normalized and that adding to it arbitrary multiples of @xmath15 , for @xmath16 , does not alter this normalization .",
    "one then arrives using standard techniques @xcite at a formal expression for the probability of arriving from @xmath17 to @xmath2 in time @xmath18 : @xmath19 we now turn to the characterization of a metastable state within the general setting outlined above . in view of the informal description of metastability sketched in the introduction , it is clear that if we wish to have a behaviour different from equilibrium over a large time scale , one needs that at least one of the @xmath11 be much closer to zero than the rest .",
    "let us assume that @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "now consider a process evolving from the initial condition @xmath17 .",
    "then , following ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) , in the relevant time range @xmath22 , one finds that the configuration @xmath2 is occupied with the following ( time - independent ) probability @xmath23 note that , due to ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) , this is normalized .",
    "since it differs exponentially little from the exact result , we may also conclude that it is everywhere positive , except perhaps in some places where it assumes exponentially small negative values ; the latter can be fixed by setting the offending negative values to zero and recomputing the normalization .",
    "this result focuses our attention on the value @xmath24 , which characterizes the nature of the initial condition .",
    "this quantity will be central to understanding the conditions under which the initial condition can truly be called metastable and the resulting probability distribution given by ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) can justifiably be identified with that of a metastable state .",
    "let us be more specific .",
    "in what follows , we denote @xmath25 by @xmath26 , and the maximum value of @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "next we define the two sets @xmath28 and @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30 and @xmath29 is defined to be the complement of @xmath28 . the choice of the factor @xmath31 to define the lower bound on @xmath26 in ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) is purely arbitrary and a matter of convention",
    ".    we will show that given the previous scenario , the system will have a metastable state , in the sense discussed in the introduction , if @xmath32 i.e.  that the probability of being found in @xmath28 in equilibrium is negligibly small , and we define the `` metastable state '' as the state described by the probability distribution @xmath33 it should be stressed that , from a physical point of view , condition ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) is the _ crucial _ assumption : it allows to distinguish true metastable states from other slowly decaying states .",
    "of course , in concrete instances this hypothesis will not be easy to prove rigorously , and , for this reason , our approach is in a sense somewhat formal .",
    "we shall , however , show that a large number of consequences follow from ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to prove ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) to show that the restricted state approach to the statistical description of metastable states is applicable .",
    "( note that the importance of ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) was already pointed out in @xcite . )    in what follows we will show that the properties of systems in which assumption ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) holds give rise to a behaviour which can be identified as metastabilty .",
    "these properties are :    1 .",
    "the probability that a state evolving from an initial condition @xmath34 for which @xmath35 ( or very close to it ) leaves @xmath28 in a time less than @xmath18 is of order @xmath36 .",
    "this justifies identifying such a state as a very persistent one . from this result",
    "it also follows that @xmath37\\ll1 . \\label{eq:1.11}\\ ] ] from this inequality and the positivity properties discussed above , we conclude that @xmath38 note , however , that the above feature is not enough to characterize a metastable state . a slowly decaying hydrodynamic mode , say , would have the same property .",
    "the probability that a state is found in @xmath29 after a time of order @xmath39 , evolving from an initial condition @xmath34 such that @xmath40 , is @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the state has remained in @xmath28 for a time of order @xmath39 , then the value of @xmath42 grows to values very close to @xmath27 on the same time scale .",
    "these results are crucial , because they mean that systems which have @xmath43 relax fast either to equilibrium or to the metastable state .",
    "once they are in the metastable state , they can be described by the probability distribution @xmath44 defined in ( [ eq:1.91 ] ) . in order to prove this characteristic property",
    ", we have to make use of the defining property of metastable states ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) .",
    "3 .   finally ,",
    "if we define a new process in which all transition rates connecting the metastable region @xmath28 defined by ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) to @xmath29 are set equal to zero , we obtain another markov process , also satisfying detailed balance with respect to the restriction of @xmath5 to @xmath28 .",
    "we show that if both processes are started from the same initial condition @xmath34 satisfying @xmath35 then the two processes remain close ( in the sense of distance in variation ) over a time of order @xmath45 .",
    "this result leads to @xmath46 and @xmath47 which is interpreted in a natural way as the free energy difference between the two phases .",
    "+ note that this final result also allows to carry over standard results valid for equilibrium systems to the metastable case : one first applies the result to the restricted process , which is a _ bona fide _ markov process defined on @xmath28 for all times , and then extends it to the metastable case by arguing that the two processes are close for the relevant timescale @xmath48 . in particular , the result derived in @xcite can partly be rederived in this way : the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem holds in metastable states of the kind we describe , because it can be derived as a general property of markov processes with detailed balance .",
    "the above results therefore indicate that the program of defining a restricted equilibrium ensemble to describe metastability can be carried out in a fairly rigorous fashion in the context of markovian proceses satisfying detailed balance .",
    "for a detailed derivation of these results , see @xcite . here",
    "we content ourselves with a rough sketch of how they come about .",
    "note first the following basic property : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes a path of the markov process defined by ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , and @xmath51 denotes the expectation value .",
    "this relation is easily verified by a straightforward computation and means that @xmath52 is a martingale .    to prove point ( 1 ) , assume that the initial condition @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 .",
    "now ( [ eq:1.16 ] ) means that , on average , @xmath55 should neither go up nor down .",
    "since it starts at the highest possible value of @xmath26 , it has nowhere to go but down ( on short time scales this is not significantly changed by the factor @xmath56 ) . therefore going down",
    "a significant amount is unlikely .",
    "it is therefore not likely to leave @xmath57 in the relevant time scale .",
    "point ( 2 ) is more technical : it can be shown that the condition ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) implies that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are substantially different from zero on two disjoint sets . therefore",
    ", if the initial condition @xmath53 satisfies @xmath40 , it evolves into a state given by @xmath60 .",
    "\\label{eq:1.17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but this state can be interpreted as being in the equilibrium state with probability @xmath41 or in the metastable state with probability @xmath61 .    for point ( 3 ) consider the restricted process , where the rates are defined by @xmath62 this process satisfies detailed balance with respect to @xmath58 , just as does the original process .",
    "the trajectories of the physical process starting from @xmath53 with @xmath35 have the same probabilities as the corresponding trajectories of the restricted process _ except when the former cross from @xmath57 to @xmath29_. but , as was shown in point ( 1 ) , such crossings are unlikely , so the two processes indeed remain close to each other in the relevant time range .",
    "we now proceed to discuss how these ideas can be applied concretely to the case of the 2d kinetic ising model .",
    "as is well known , if @xmath63 and a small magnetic field @xmath64 is applied , then the spontaneous magnetization in equilibrium points in the direction of the field",
    ". there is , however , for a broad range of parameters , a metastable state for which the magnetization is in the direction opposite to the field .",
    "free energy @xmath65 of the 2d ising model ( see ( [ eq:3.5 ] ) for the definition ) for a @xmath66 sample with @xmath67 , i.e.  significantly below criticality .",
    "note the secondary minima for @xmath68 , which are quite pronounced in spite of our considering a fairly large system . ]",
    "we wish to show a way to obtain some confirmation of the ideas described above through simulations of this system .",
    "a crucial issue is to identify the observables which play an essential role in determining @xmath26 and hence @xmath57 . for the ferromagnetic ising model , we assume that these observables reduce simply to the spin interaction energy @xmath69 and the magnetization @xmath70 . for systems of the size we consider presently , it is not possible for a nucleating droplet , which is the crucial factor determining whether a system is or is not about to nucleate , to appear without noticeably affecting the values of @xmath51 and @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath72 ,      \\label{eq:3.1}\\ ] ] which _ defines _ @xmath73 .",

    "summing over all configurations @xmath2 having the same value of @xmath51 and @xmath71 , the equilibrium probability that the system is in the macrostate @xmath76 is @xmath77 .",
    "\\label{eq:3.3}\\ ] ] here , @xmath78 is the density of states of the ising model , given by @xmath79      \\delta\\left [      m - m(\\sigma )      \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq:3.4}\\ ] ] this can be computed numerically in an efficient manner , say using the wang ",
    "landau algorithm @xcite .    in the metastable region @xmath57",
    "one has @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 can also be expressed in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath71 using ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) .",
    "since the metastable state is well characterized by specific values of @xmath51 and @xmath71 , it is to be expected that the expression on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq:3.3 ] )",
    "will show a local maximum at these non - equilibrium values .",
    "this is confirmed numerically for @xmath82 as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "here we plot in figure [ fig:1 ] the free energy @xmath83      \\label{eq:3.5}\\ ] ] at a fixed subcritical temperature .",
    "a secondary minimum is seen in figure [ fig:1 ] , which corresponds to the metastable maximum of @xmath13 .",
    "such a state of affairs will not exist in the thermodynamic limit : indeed , up to an additive term @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the free energy of the ising model in an ensemble of fixed temperature and magnetization . by standard theorems on short - range systems",
    "@xcite , this must be equivalent in the thermodynamic limit to the free energy computed as the legendre transform of the gibbs potential calculated in the grand canonical ensemble . hence , as the thermodynamic limit is approached",
    ", @xmath85 must tend to a convex function in @xmath71 , and the additive term @xmath84 does not alter this fact .",
    "this is clearly at odds with the presence of two minima in @xmath85 as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "therefore , our identification of @xmath51 and @xmath71 as adequate variables to determine @xmath26 is not tenable beyond a certain sample size .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that for large systems a nucleating droplet may appear without affecting the values of @xmath51 and @xmath71 .    in the systems",
    "in which @xmath51 and @xmath71 do furnish a complete description , it is possible to determine @xmath27 and hence the free energy difference betwen the stable and metastable phase as follows : ( [ eq:1.15 ] ) yields @xmath27 as a function of the probability of finding the system in @xmath57 in equilibrium . since we have identified @xmath57 with a certain part of @xmath76 space , we can readily compute this probability once @xmath86 is known .",
    "this free energy difference can also be compared with one obtained from hysteresis curves , and the comparison is quite satisfactory .",
    "these results will be discussed more extensively in @xcite .",
