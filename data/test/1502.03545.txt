    "the morphology of galaxies is of great interest because it reflects not only the structural properties of galaxies but also their star formation histories .",
    "a morphological study of galaxies has been one of the main topics of extra - galactic studies since the pioneering work by @xcite . despite the enormous efforts to determine the morphological types of galaxies , the morphological types of the majority of galaxies from recent surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , still need to be determined .",
    "the morphology of bright galaxies in the local universe has been well studied and summarized in catalogs , such as a revised shaply - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( rsa , @xcite ) and the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 , @xcite ) . however , none of these catalogs are suitable for dwarf galaxy studies because most dwarf galaxies which are much fainter than the bright end of dwarf galaxies are omitted due to their selection criteria .",
    "the recent study of @xcite , who visually classified 14,000 sdss galaxies from data release 4 ( dr4 ) , focussed on the redshift range @xmath10 , and as a consequence included few dwarf galaxies .",
    "the galaxy zoo project @xcite has provided morphological information for a much larger number of objects , but only in broad categories with little information on dwarf galaxies .",
    "dwarf galaxies , however , are predicted to be the most dominant type of galaxy based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology @xcite . the importance of dwarf galaxies in galactic astronomy has been well demonstrated by the dominance of dwarf galaxies in the local group ( lg ) , in which the number of dwarf galaxies tripled recently , mostly thanks to sdss @xcite .",
    "they also dominate the nearby satellite systems such as those hosted by m81 @xcite and m106 @xcite .",
    "galaxies with distances less than @xmath11mpc and velocities relative to the lg ( @xmath12 ) less than 600kms@xmath13 , which were compiled in the updated nearby galaxy catalog @xcite , are also dominated by dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented an all - sky catalog of nearby galaxy groups that included 10,914 galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath14 ) with various astrophysical parameters including the morphological types in numerical code @xmath15 . on the other hand , they did not report the detailed morphological types of dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite provided a better treatment of the morphology of dwarf galaxies , but they confined the dwarfs to within @xmath11mpc . because galaxies in the local universe will provide a unique sample to explore the structural properties of dwarf galaxies , it is important to determine their detailed morphological types .",
    "sdss opens a new era of galaxy morphology by providing color images which are useful for obtaining information about the underlying stellar populations . because stellar populations are closely related to the star formation history of galaxies , the morphological types that consider the stellar populations using color information and the light distributions can be considered to be the best proxy for characterizing the integral property of galaxies .",
    "the blue elliptical galaxy @xcite , is an example of a new type of galaxy that has emerged in the new era of the galaxy morphology .",
    "moreover , it is deep enough to cover dwarf galaxies as faint as @xmath16 in the local universe .",
    "another major difference between the morphological properties observed in single - band images and color images were found in the dwarf elliptical ( de ) family .",
    "although de galaxies and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) are distinguished in the lg , they were used interchangeably for galaxies outside the lg in previous studies . in particular , @xcite used de and de , n for both de galaxies and dsph galaxies in a classification of virgo cluster dwarfs , whereas @xcite used sph for both galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", there appears to be some difference between de and dsph @xcite .",
    "for example , de galaxies are generally brighter and redder than dsph galaxies .",
    "although the environmental dependence of giant galaxies is well understood thanks to recent surveys , such as sdss @xcite , the dependence of dwarf galaxy morphology on environment has not been well studied due to the lack of dwarf galaxies in previous analyses .",
    "therefore , it is important to produce a homogeneous sample of dwarf galaxies with detailed morphological types . because the limiting magnitude of spectroscopic observations of the sdss is @xmath17 , it is possible to make a volume - limited sample brighter than @xmath18 if galaxies with redshift less than @xmath19 are used .",
    "this provides an unprecedented opportunity to classify the morphological types of local galaxies using the color images of the sdss dr7 with an emphasis on dwarf galaxies , whose morphological properties are still not well understood .",
    "particular attention was paid to the morphologies of de - like galaxies because they are the building blocks of larger structures in cdm cosmology . in particular ,",
    "dsph are believed to be mostly dark matter dominated dwarfs ( e.g. , gilmore et al .",
    "2007 ) . because de galaxies show different properties from dsph , such as the presence of gas and young stellar populations , at least for the lg dwarfs @xcite , it is important to determine whether they can be distinguished by morphology alone .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a census of the morphology distribution of local galaxies brighter than @xmath20 . to accomplish this , the morphological types of all sdss galaxies that have redshifts less than @xmath19 are classified by visual inspection of the color images of sdss dr7 .",
    "the results are presented in the form of a catalog that includes not only our classificiations , but also numerical t types , adopted distances , absolute @xmath21-band magnitudes , @xmath22 colors , and isophotal angular diameters and axis ratios .",
    "an additional aim is to better understand the environment of local galaxies , a factor which can play an important role in morphology .",
    "section 2 introduces the observational data used in this study and the procedure for selecting the sample galaxies .",
    "section 3 describes the methodology of morphology classification and section 4 provides a catalog of the morphological types of the local galaxies .",
    "section 5 presents the physical and morphological properties of the local galaxies and section 6 reports the environmental dependence of the morphology .",
    "the final section provides a brief summary and discussion .",
    "the basic sample of the local galaxies in this paper was derived from the korea institute for advanced study value - added galaxy catalog ( kias - vagc choi et al .",
    "2010 ) , but was supplemented by galaxies with @xmath23 in the nasa extragalactic data base ( ned ) and the galaxies listed in @xcite that are not overlapped with the galaxies from the kias - vagc and ned .",
    "the kias - vagc is a value - added catalog of galaxies based on the new york university value - added catalog ( nyu - vagc ) dr7 which was derived from the sdss dr7 @xcite ) . the kias - vagc provides valuable astrophysical parameters such as absolute magnitude and colors corrected for the galactic extinction as well as distances and morphological types determined by automated classifier @xcite .",
    "it also lists the redshifts of 10,497 galaxies that are not included in nyu - vagc .",
    "they gathered redshift data from various catalogs ( see choi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for a detailed description ) .",
    "more detailed descriptions of sdss data were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of the galaxies with redshifts less than 0.01 were selected from the kias - vagc .",
    "the color images of the individual galaxies listed in the kias - vagc were examined carefully to determine whether they are parts of a galaxy or multiply listed .",
    "a few tens of galaxies were removed from the selected galaxies because of their multiple entry or invalid redshift .",
    "the number of cleaned galaxies from kias - vagc is 4807 .",
    "in addition , 897 galaxies from ned , whose images and photometric data are available from sdss dr7 , were added .",
    "we present the number distribution of the sample galaxies as a function of redshift in figure 1 .",
    "the total number of sample galaxies is 5836 .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of sample galaxies in a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the petrosian @xmath21 magnitude and @xmath22 color are used as the representative magnitude and color of a galaxy because the petrosian @xmath21 magnitude was used to select the spectroscopic target galaxies and the @xmath22 color is one of the best proxies of the galaxy morphology because of its close dependence on the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "most galaxies brighter than the limiting magnitude of the sdss spectroscopic target galaxies ( @xmath17 ) are located in a relatively narrow range of @xmath22 colors , whereas galaxies fainter than @xmath17 have a wide range of @xmath22 colors .",
    "the color range of galaxies brighter than @xmath17 is similar to that of the volume - limited sample of galaxies brighter than @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the redshifts of galaxies fainter than @xmath17 have been observed by other surveys , such as 2dfgrs @xcite , which is deeper than sdss .",
    "figure 3 presents the distribution of @xmath21-band isophotal semi - major axis length ( @xmath25 ) and the axial ratio ( @xmath26 ) of sample galaxies whose isophotal semi - major and semi - minor axis lengths are available in the sdss dr7 .",
    "the isophotal axis lengths were measured at an isophote of 25 mag arcsec@xmath27 at each pass - band .",
    "most galaxies are larger than @xmath28 pixels .",
    "therefore , galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath23 ) are large enough for visual classification .",
    "approximately @xmath29 spiral galaxies are inclined more than @xmath30 .",
    "these edge - on galaxies comprise @xmath31 of the total galaxies and @xmath32 of spiral galaxies .",
    "galaxies less than @xmath33arcsec are mostly face - on galaxies .",
    "traditionally , morphological classification has been performed through inspection of photographic plates or prints sensitive to the blue region of the spectrum ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs 1959 ; sandage 1961 ; sandage and tammann 1981 ; sandage and bedke 1994 ) .",
    "more recently , galaxies have been classified using logarithmic , sky - subtracted digital @xmath34-band images in units of mag arcsec@xmath27 ( e.g. , buta et al . 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to be `` true '' to the traditional classification systems , all of which are built on the original hubble ( 1926 , 1936 ) system , one should use sdss @xmath35-band images since these are close enough in wavelength to the @xmath34 band .    in the present study , however , we use the color images provided by the sdss which are based on a combination of @xmath36 images @xcite . for some galaxy types ,",
    "the use of such images could lead to systematic differences from blue light classifications because the inclusion of the @xmath37 band can enhance the prominence of galactic bulges , which play a role in the t type .",
    "our reasons for using color images over @xmath35-band images are twofold .",
    "first , color adds information to morphology by its ability to distinguish underlying stellar populations .",
    "second , our sample is dominated by galaxies that have very little or no bulge , making the possible impact of the @xmath37 band on t types less of an issue .",
    "@xcite show that color gradients and the colors of galaxies are effective for automatic classification .",
    "we therefore feel that the use of color images for visual classification is justified .",
    "the classification scheme of the morphological types of galaxies is based on the rc3 classification system @xcite , which is the de vaucouleurs revised hubble - sandage system , or vrhs @xcite .",
    "the description and sample color images given by @xcite are also consulted .",
    "the classification scheme is simplified by neglecting stages of elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "that is , the three stages of elliptical galaxies , compact ellipticals ( ce ) , normal ellipticals ( e ) , and late - type ellipticals ( e@xmath38 ) and the three stages of lenticular galaxies , s0@xmath38 , s0@xmath39 and s0@xmath40 are not distinguished .",
    "the reason for this is that these e / s0 stages are based mostly on subtle aspects of structure and ignoring them has little impact on our analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "all of the stages of spiral galaxies from 0/a to m are distinguished .",
    "de / dsph galaxies are separated from giant ellipticals because the surface brightness distribution of de galaxies is significantly different from that of the giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "elliptical galaxies are believed to have a simple structure .",
    "but , thanks to the color information that is sensitive to the underlying stellar populations , it is possible to detect peculiar morphologies induced by recent star formation in elliptical galaxies . the discovery of blue elliptical galaxies showing almost identical shapes to those of normal elliptical galaxies but with different colors @xcite is a good example of the usefulness of color images in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "earlier studies of blue elliptical galaxies revealed anomalous blue cores @xcite .",
    "for example .",
    "ngc 3156 and ngc 4742 have blue cores which are caused by the presence of young stellar populations in the nuclear regions @xcite .",
    "the distinction between elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies is made mainly by their surface brightness distribution .",
    "elliptical galaxies show steeper surface brightness gradients than lenticular galaxies , particularly in the outer parts .",
    "this is why the luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies are best represented by the sersic function with @xmath41 whereas those of lenticular galaxies are best fit by the sersic function with @xmath42 .",
    "galaxies with characteristics intermediate between ellipticals and lenticulars are classified as e / s0 .",
    "lenticular galaxies are further divided into three bar families , sa0 , sab0 , and sb0 , according to their bar types .",
    "the sa0 types show no bar feature , whereas the sb0 types show a clear bar morphology crossing the central bulge .",
    "lenticular galaxies with intermediate bar types are assigned as sab0 . in the case of uncertain bar types , mostly due to high inclinations , they are classified as s0 galaxies .    for spiral galaxies ,",
    "the spiral arm morphology is differentiated according to the hubble stages adopted in rc3 @xcite .",
    "namely , the stages , 0/a , a , ab , b , bc , c , cd , d , dm , and m , of spiral galaxies are determined according to the relative size of the bulge and the openness of the spiral arms . on the other hand , the spiral varieties , ( r ) and ( s ) ,",
    "are not distinguished because they are less fundamental than stage and family , and , as for the e / s0 stages , ignoring them has little or no impact on our analysis .",
    "we also exclude recognition of outer rings and pseudorings for the same reason .",
    "therefore , for example , a strongly barred spiral galaxy with an intermediate hubble stage is denoted as sbc , whereas a non - barred spiral galaxy with an intermediate hubble stage is denoted sac . for edge - on spirals ,",
    "the bar families are not distinguished in this study and the hubble stage is denoted as sa , sab , sb , etc .",
    "irregular galaxies are divided into three types : i m , dwarf irregular ( di ) , and bcd .",
    "the first type , i m , is a natural extension of the late - type spirals and some i m galaxies are believed to have a bar component . in that case , a morphological type , ibm , is assigned .",
    "the second type , di , represents small dwarf galaxies with an amorphous shape .",
    "their physical properties , such as size , luminosity , and colors are similar to those of dsph and de@xmath2 galaxies , which are described below .",
    "the last type , bcd , stands for the blue compact dwarf and is characterized by star burst regions .",
    "they have amorphous shapes with high central surface brightness , and are likely to show an outer irregular envelope .",
    "however , there is no unique definition of bcd in the literature @xcite but the morphological properties of bcds in the present sample are similar to those of the bcds analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the shapes of bcd galaxies without an outer irregular envelope , i.e. , hii region - like bcds , are similar to the small blue dwarf elliptical galaxy ( de@xmath2 ) described below .",
    "bcds show an extremely blue color due to bursts of star formation .",
    "a significant fraction of irregular galaxies have small star burst regions .",
    "these galaxies are distinguished from i m and di as well as bcd .",
    "we designate these galaxies as ir / bcd .",
    "in addition to di galaxies , there are five types of dwarf galaxies : dwarf lenticular galaxies ( ds0 ) , de galaxies , blue - cored dwarf elliptical galaxies ( de@xmath43 ) , dsph galaxies , and de@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "we designate these five dwarf galaxies as de - like galaxies .",
    "the dwarf lenticular galaxies were introduced by @xcite for the morphological classification of dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "they are characterized by lens - like features that have a shallow brightness gradient interior to a sharp edge .",
    "( see buta ( 2013 ) for further discussion of lenses in disk galaxies . ) in this respect , ds0 galaxies are different from their giant cousins , s0 galaxies , which are characterized by a bulge and a disk .",
    "a majority of ds0 galaxies show nucleation .",
    "the presence and absence of nucleation are distinguished by the subscripts @xmath44 and @xmath45 as ds0@xmath46 and ds0@xmath47 for a nucleated one and an un - nucleated one , respectively .",
    "some dwarf galaxies exhibit similar characteristics to ds0 galaxies but the outer parts of these galaxies show disturbed disks , mostly resembling disrupted spiral arms .",
    "these galaxies are classified as ds0@xmath48 .",
    "we do not distinguish ds0@xmath48 galaxies from ds0 galaxies , except for the description of a detailed morphology .",
    "de galaxies can be distinguished from giant elliptical galaxies by their surface brightness distribution , which is better represented by the sersic function with @xmath49 .",
    "most previous studies do not distinguish between de galaixes and dsph galaxies ( eg . , binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ; kormendy & bender 2012 ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite use sph to represent spheroidal galaxies that can be placed in a position parallel to the i m galaxies in their revised parallel - sequence galaxy classification , which extends the van den bergh parallel - sequence galaxy classification @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the sph galaxies are stripped scd - im galaxies .",
    "however , our study considers dsph galaxies as a distinct population of dwarf galaxies because photometric properties , such as surface brightness and colors of dsph galaxies , seem to be different from those of de galaxies .",
    "moreover , if we consider that dsph galaxies are mostly dispersion - supported systems @xcite while a considerable fraction of de galaxies are supported by rotation @xcite , their origins might be different .",
    "the de and dsph galaxies are distinguished by their surface brightness while de@xmath2 galaxies are distinguished from others by their blue color .",
    "the de@xmath43 galaxies are characterized by the presence of blue cores which are supposed to be regions of active star formation .",
    "the de and dsph galaxies are further distinguished by their nuclear morphology : de@xmath47 , de@xmath46 , dsph@xmath47 and dsph@xmath46 .",
    "the distinction of nucleated dwarfs from un - nulceated dwarfs is somewhat arbitrary because the degree of nucleation varies continuously @xcite .",
    "blue - cored dwarfs , however , are easily distinguished from nucleated dwarfs because the cores are bluer and larger than the nuclear region of nucleated dwarfs .",
    "blue dwarf ellipticals ( de@xmath2 ) have similar color to irregular galaxies .",
    "their size is similar to or smaller than hii region - like bcds .",
    "small de@xmath2 and di galaxies have similar features except for the axial symmetry . on the other hand , there is no clear distinction in the degree of axial symmetry for de@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it seems plausible that de@xmath2 galaxies are di galaxies with an extreme axial symmetry .    for practical purposes , the numerical type @xmath50 borrowed from rc3",
    "is used with some simplification for the ellipticals ( @xmath50=-5 ) and lenticulars ( @xmath50=-3 ) .",
    "however , we keep all of the hubble stages from t=0 to t=9 for spirals ( from @xmath51 to @xmath52 ) and @xmath50=10 ( i m ) and @xmath50=11 ( di ) for irregulars .",
    "bcd is assigned as @xmath50=13 , while irregulars containing small bcd - like components as @xmath50=12 .",
    "also , we assign new codes from -6 to -11 for dwarf elliptical - like galaxies : @xmath50=-6 ( de ) , @xmath50=-7 ( de@xmath43 ) , @xmath50=-8 ( dsph ) , @xmath50=-9 ( de@xmath2 ) , @xmath50=-10 ( ds0 , ds0@xmath48 ) , and @xmath50=-11 for transition type dwarf ( des / di di / des ) , respectively .    in the present study",
    ", the color images of the sub - sample of galaxies were examined using the image display tool provided by the sdss for training before the classification of the full sample of galaxies .",
    "the morphological types given in the ned were consulted during the training period . because the number of subtypes to be classified is more than 20 , morphological types were classified in two steps .",
    "galaxies were divided into four broad types ( elliptical / lenticulars , spirals , irregulars , and de - like galaxies ) , and their fine subtypes were then classified after sorting the galaxies according to their broad types .",
    "the entire sample of galaxies was classified by each of the three authors .",
    "we followed two steps to finalize the morphological types of galaxies . in the first step ,",
    "one of the authors ( seo ) determined the morphological types of the entire sample by consulting the results of other authors .",
    "the final morphological type of each galaxy was determined by the senior author after reviewing seo s classification .",
    "there is not much difference between the final morphological types and those of seo for giant galaxies ( e , s0 , and sp ) and irregular galaxies . however , about @xmath53 of seo s classification of de - like galaxies are revised , mostly within the category of de - like galaxies .",

    "we suppose that galactic extinction is negligible for the present sample due to the sdss - covered area , however , inclination might affect the isophotal diameter . there have been a number of studies on the effect of inclination on the isophotal diameter @xcite . while @xcite assumed that the change in diameter due to the inclination of a galaxy is negligible , @xcite thought that the inclination effects are need to be corrected . however , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , it depends on the optical nature of galaxies . in the case of spiral galaxies , their disks",
    "are believed to be optically thick @xcite , whereas the disks of lenticular galaxies are thought to be optically thin @xcite .",
    "the isophotal diameters of optically thin disks increase with inclination .",
    "the isophotal radius is calculated from the isophotal semi - major axis of the @xmath21-band image obtained from sdss dr7 .",
    "the isophotal semi - major and semi - minor axes are measured at a surface brightness ( @xmath112 ) of 25 mag arcsec@xmath27 at five pass - bands ( @xmath113 ) in the sdss , and are given in units of pixels .",
    "the isophotal axis lengths in the pixels are converted to kiloparsecs using a pixel size of 0.396 arcsec and the distances used to calculate the absolute magnitude .",

    ", the distributions of the isophotal radii of galaxies depend strongly on the morphological types of the galaxies .",
    "as expected , de - like galaxies show the narrowest distribution , which peaked at @xmath115kpc , and are limited to @xmath116kpc .",
    "the ir class of galaxies shows a similar narrow distribution with the same peak but it extends to @xmath117kpc .",
    "this is because most ir galaxies are dwarf galaxies with sizes similar to des .",
    "some galaxies larger than @xmath118kpc are late - type spiral - like galaxies or peculiar galaxies , some of which are merging galaxies .",
    "the ranges of isophotal radii of the ellipticals and lenticulars are similar , even though there are large fluctuations in the ellipticals due to the small number of galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the most probable sizes of the lenticulars and spirals are similar to each other ( @xmath119kpc ) whereas the ranges of the distributions are significantly different .",
    "the sizes of the largest spirals are about two times larger than those of the lenticulars .",
    "the same is true for those elliptical galaxies which show a similar size distribution to that of the lenticular galaxies .",
    "the reason for the double size of the spiral galaxies is thought to be the late accretion of the intergalactic material @xcite , which makes the inside - out growth of galaxies similar to that assumed for the formation of the milky way .    the basic properties of a galaxy such as mass , luminosity , radius , and morphology are believed to be determined by the galaxy formation process .",
    "these parameters are supposed to be correlated with each other because they have the same origin .",
    "the radius - luminosity relation @xcite is an example of such a correlation .",
    "because the galaxy size depends on the morphology , as shown in figure 18 , the interplay between the size and luminosity is supposed to be more complex .",
    "there have been many studies to investigate the morphology dependence of the radius - luminosity relation of galaxies since the pioneering work by @xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies used proxies of galaxy morphology rather than morphology itself @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite used the concentration index as a proxy of the morphology .",
    "as is well known from previous studies @xcite , proxies are at best a crude approximation of galaxy morphological types . in this regard , @xcite distinguished early - type galaxies and late - type galaxies by visual inspection of the images for an analysis of the structure of central galaxies in groups and clusters .",
    "therefore , the morphological types presented in this study will be useful to explore the interplay between the size and luminosity of galaxies .",
    "we are planning to do this in a series of forthcoimng papers .",
    "we are particularly interested in the radius - luminosity relation of dwarf galaxies .      the axial ratio of a galaxy ( @xmath26 ) is closely related to the intrinsic shape of the galaxy , which is determined by its dynamical structure .",

    "the isophotal semi - major and semi - minor axes in @xmath21-band , which are measured at a surface brightness of 25 mag arcsec@xmath27 , are used .",
    "figure 19 plots the three morphological types of giant galaxies ( e , s0 , and sp ) compared to their dwarf cousins ( de and ds0 ) for e and s0 galaxies and irregular galaxies for spiral galaxies . the axis ratio distributions of the ellipticals and de ( left panel ) are similar , whereas a significant difference was observed in the lenticular and dwarf lenticular galaxies ( middle panel ) as well as in spiral galaxies ( right panel ) .",
    "the solid lines represent the giant galaxies and the dotted lines indicate the dwarf counterparts .",
    "although the general shapes of the axis ratio distributions of the giant elliptical galaxies and de galaxies are similar , there are some differences between the two .",

    "the morphological type of this galaxy ( ngc  2768 ) is controversial .",
    "it is classified as e6 in rc3 , whereas the morphological type adopted by the ned is s0 , which was taken from the carnegie atlas of galaxies @xcite . the more flattened structure of de galaxies is consistent with those observations showing fast rotation in a considerable fraction of de galaxies @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the general similarity of the axis ratio distributions of the giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies suggests that a large fraction of dwarf elliptical galaxies are dispersion - supported systems like giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the dissimilarity of the axis ratio distributions of giant and dwarf lenticular galaxies is quite interesting because ds0s are considered to be low - luminosity versions of s0s @xcite .",
    "the axis ratio distribution for ds0s in figure 19 seems to show well that the ds0s should not be thought of as small versions of s0s .",
    "rather , they are close to de galaxies because their axis ratio distribution is similar to that of de galaxies .",
    "the lack of ds0s with an isophotal axis ratio ( @xmath26 ) less than 0.3 suggests that they are intrinsically thicker than s0s .",
    "the lack of small axis ratios is also observed in de and irregulars , suggesting less flattened shapes for these galaxies .",
    "the thick intrinsic shape of irregular galaxies is consistent with earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the dissimilar distributions of the axis ratios of spiral galaxies and irregular galaxies shown in the right panel of figure 19 are believed to be caused by the real difference in their dynamical structures because the statistical noises are small enough to be ignored due to the large number of spiral and irregular galaxies . in the case of lenticular galaxies , the axis ratio distribution of which",
    "is supposed to be similar to that of the spiral galaxies .",
    "we can see a large fluctuation in the histogram due to the small number of lenticular galaxies , which is about one - seventh that of the spiral galaxies .",
    "the larger fraction of small axis ratios in spiral galaxies is due to the rotating disks of spiral galaxies , the orientations of which are random , whereas the lack of small axis ratios in the irregular galaxies is believed to be due to the triaxial nature of irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure  20 shows the fractional distribution of the axis ratios of the dwarf elliptical - like galaxies ; de@xmath43 galaxies in the left panel , dsph galaxies in the middle panel , and de@xmath2 galaxies in the right panel .",
    "the axis ratio distribution of de galaxies ( dotted lines ) is also plotted for comparison . due to the small numbers , there are large fluctuations in the histograms but there seem to be some differences among the subtypes of de - like galaxies .",
    "the most pronounced difference is observed between de and de@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "it is due to the narrow range of axis ratio distribution of de@xmath2 galaxies with a lower limit of @xmath121 .",
    "approximately 80@xmath122 of de@xmath2 galaxies have axis ratios between @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "the lack of a systematic difference between de and de@xmath43 is consistent with the morphological similarity between the two types of galaxies , except for the presence of blue cores in de@xmath43 galaxies .",
    "the axis ratio distribution of dsph galaxies is similar to that of de galaxies but the lower fraction of galaxies with small @xmath26 appears to be real because they are systematically lower than that of de galaxies for a small axis ratio ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the lack of galaxies with a small @xmath26 is consistent with the kinematic observations of dsph galaxies @xcite .",
    "the morphology of dwarf elliptical galaxies is characterized by their round appearance and red colors , similar to that of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , there are some differences in the photometric properties between de and giant ellipticals .",
    "for example , de galaxies exhibit lower surface brightness and a shallower luminosity gradient than giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the mean luminosity of de galaxies is @xmath125 , which is approximately 3.5 mag fainter than the mean luminosity ( @xmath126 ) of elliptical galaxies listed in the present catalog .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite argued that these differences result from the structural difference between de and giant ellipticals .",
    "therefore , de galaxies can not simply be a small version of giant elliptical galaxies ( kormendy & bender ( 2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "the real dwarf counterparts of giant elliptical galaxies are compact elliptical galaxies , exemplified by m32 @xcite .",
    "they have sizes comparable to dwarf elliptical galaxies but have a high surface brightness .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite agrued that the scaling relations of the dwarf elliptical galaxies are continuations of those of giant elliptical galaxies because the nonlinear relations between the absolute magnitude and the effective surface brightness or effective radius are consequences of the two linear relations between the stellar concentration , quantified by the sersic index @xmath44 , and stellar mass or central surface brightness .",
    "their structural characteristics are not distinguished from those of giant elliptical galaxies ( graham 2013 , and references therein ) .",
    "whether or not de galaxies are distinct populations , they are thought to be a mixture of kinematically heterogeneous populations @xcite , the origins of which are thought to be different @xcite .",
    "the three subtypes of de - like galaxies , de@xmath47 , de@xmath46 and de@xmath43 , have similar structure except for the nuclear morphology .",
    "normally , the blue cores of de@xmath43 galaxies are larger than the star - like nuclei in de@xmath46 galaxies but in some cases , they appear small .",

    "the number of de@xmath43 galaxies that have a small core is negligibly small .",
    "the global colors of de@xmath43 galaxies are similar to those of de@xmath47 and de@xmath46 galaxies . however , in some cases , their colors appear quite blue close to de@xmath2 galaxies .    the well - known examples of de@xmath43 galaxies are ngc 185 @xcite and ngc 205 @xcite , both of which are satellite galaxies of m 31 .",
    "the blue cores of de@xmath43 galaxies are thought to be due to recent star formation .",

    "the low luminosity and low surface brightness of dsph galaxies are consistent with the relation between the luminosity and surface brightness of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition to the difference in surface brightness between dsph galaxies and de galaxies , there are some properties that are quite different .",
    "the presence of a blue core is barely observed in the dsph galaxies , whereas a significant fraction of de galaxies have blue cores .",
    "some difference in the axis ratio distributions is present , showing smaller fractions of highly flattened dsph galaxies .",
    "because axis ratios , i.e. , ellipticities are closely related to the degree of rotational support @xcite , dsph galaxies are believed to be mostly a dispersion - supported system , whereas de galaxies are considered to be partially supported by rotation .",
    "this picture of kinematic properties of dsph galaxies is frequently addressed in previous observations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the distinction of ellipticity distributions between dsph and de is not as clear as that in the fast and slow rotating elliptical galaxies observed in the atlas @xcite due to the fact that the fractions of rotationally supported des and dispersion - supported des are similar @xcite .",
    "however , the differences in photometry as well as in kinematics between the dsph and de galaxies suggest that they have different origins .",
    "it is quite likely that dsph galaxies are primodial objects formed at @xmath129 @xcite , while de galaxies , at least fast rotating de galaxies , are stripped late type galaxies .      the morphological distinction of de@xmath2 galaxies from other dwarf galaxies is one of the most successful uses of color images in morphology classification .",
    "while the blue colors of blue elliptical galaxies @xcite , which distinguish them from normal elliptical galaxies , are believed to be due to recent star formation in the core regions , the colors of the de@xmath2 galaxies are due to global star formation that makes their colors much bluer than the dwarf elliptical galaxies .",

    "their shapes , however , are quite similar to those of de galaxies although their axis ratio distribution is somewhat different .",

    "the de@xmath2 galaxies are similar to hii region - like bcds or di .",

    "the morphology of the central excess of light in dwarf lenticular galaxies appears to be lens - like @xcite and much less massive than a bulge . in some cases ,",
    "the lens component is quite large in size but their luminosity seems to be low .",
    "they are likely to have star - like nuclei , which causes them to be classified as ds0@xmath46 , similar to the nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies , de@xmath46 .",
    "their colors are also similar to dwarf ellipticals . in addition",
    ", it is quite rare to have bars inside and there appears to be no inner and outer rings in the dwarf lenticular galaxies .",
    "the absence of inner and outer rings in dwarf lenticular galaxies is expected if they are stripped , former late - type galaxies .",
    "rings are a phenomenon mainly of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "they are virtually never seen among extreme late - type spirals or magellanic irregulars @xcite . on the other hand , they are likely to show disrupted features in the outer parts of the galaxies .",
    "these features are probably remnants of spiral arms .",
    "if this is the case , dwarf spirals can be formed in disks as small as those of dwarf lenticular galaxies but can not survive long due to the lack of sufficient mass to protect them from tidal or hydrodynamic disturbances .",
    "compact galaxies are distinguished from others by their high surface brightnesses which are brighter than 20 mag arcsec@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "a bcd galaxy has very blue color indicative of a likely starburst .",
    "bcds show a range of morphologies in the present catalog .",
    "one extreme case is a bcd whose morphology is characterized by a hii region - like appearance , and the other extreme case is characterized by localized compact regions of intense bursts of star formation within a larger irregular galaxy .",
    "examples of the two extreme cases are presented in the two rightmost columns of the bottom row in figure 5 .",
    "the hii region - like bcds similar to those observed by @xcite who chose their samples mostly from the earlier objective prism surveys .",
    "the shape of these galaxies is similar to the small - sized de@xmath2 galaxies but they have deep bluer colors .",
    "because there is no clear color distinction between these two types of galaxies , they can be classified as genuine bcds or isolated extragalactic hii regions @xcite . on the other hand , the selection of small - sized de@xmath2 galaxies from the de@xmath2 sample of galaxies is also subjective .",
    "the other types of bcds are basically irregular galaxies with localized compact regions of intense star - bursts .",
    "the size of the compact regions of extreme star - burst varies from the size of hii regions to the galaxy size .",
    "therefore , it is also subjective to set a size - limit when selecting bcds . in the present study ,",
    "a galaxy is classified as bcd if the size of the compact regions of extreme star burst is larger than @xmath32 of the galaxy size . in order to distinguish the irregular galaxies with small star burst regions , we assign im / bcd as the morphological type of these galaxies .",
    "they are amount to @xmath32 of irregular galaxies .",
    "the majority of galaxies in the local universe are dwarf galaxies if we consider irregular galaxies fainter than m@xmath130 to be dwarf galaxies , even though we classify them as i m galaxies because of morphologies resembling the late - type spirals .",
    "di galaxies show a range of morphologies from very simple shapes to a high degree of complexity . di with a simple morphology resemble de@xmath2 or bcds .",
    "the only difference is the degree of roundness . di galaxies with complex morphologies are caused mainly by sites of intense star formation .",
    "they are too small to drive the global density waves .",

    "interactions with neighboring galaxies makes their morphology rounder and rounder if the interactions occur frequently .",
    "the morphology of some di galaxies show a transition type from di to de / dsph or vice versa .",
    "the morphology of a galaxy is dependent on its environment .",
    "this dependence has been represented by the morphology - density relation since the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "there are a variety of ways to measure the local background density of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite explored the dependence of disk morphology on the local background density derived from the @xmath44th nearest neighbor method with @xmath131 , @xmath132 , which is defined as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the projected distance to the fifth nearest galaxy brighter than @xmath18 with @xmath135kms@xmath13 .",
    "we normalized @xmath132 by the mean local background density ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "figure  21 shows the fractional density distribution of local galaxies sorted by the broad morphological types . as shown in figure 21 , the distributions of the local background density of galaxies with different morphology differ greatly .",
    "elliptical galaxies are most frequent in the high - density regions , forming a narrow peak at the high - density regions with an extended tail toward the low - density regions , whereas spiral and irregular galaxies show approximately symmetrical distributions with a peak density at log ( @xmath137 . lenticular and de - like galaxies show similar density distributions to that of elliptical galaxies with a slightly larger fraction of galaxies in the low - density regions than elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that de - like galaxies do not obey the luminosity - density relation @xcite because it dictates that dwarf galaxies which are basically much less luminous than elliptical and lenticular galaxies are located preferentially in the low - density regions .",
    "this means that the morphology of a galaxy , particularly a dwarf galaxy , can be affected greatly by other environmental properties . the interactions with large galaxies to which most of dwarf galaxies are bound as satellite galaxies are considered to be the main cause of the secondary parameter affecting the dwarf galaxy morphology .",
    "the distance to the nearest neighbor ( @xmath138 ) appears to be a good measure of the galaxy environment because the effect of interactions depends on the separation between the interacting galaxies .    to see the dependence of the galaxy morphology on the local background density , the fraction of galaxy morphological types is plotted as a function of the local background density ( figure 22 ) . in general , they follow the morphology - density relation , i.e. , the fractions of early type galaxies ( e , s0 , and des ) increase with increasing local background density , whereas those of late type galaxies ( sp and ir ) decrease with increasing density .",
    "although the general pattern of increasing fractions with increasing local background density is the same for the three classes of early type galaxies , there are some differences between them .",
    "fractions of the two early type giant galaxies ( e and s0 ) show an almost flat distributions at log ( @xmath139 and gradual increase thereafter , whereas that of the early type dwarf galaxies ( des ) shows a nearly monotonic increase with increasing density with a sudden change of the slope at log ( @xmath140 .",
    "irregular galaxies show a nearly opposite trend from that of des at log ( @xmath141 and a somewhat flat distriobution at log ( @xmath142 with a local minimum around log ( @xmath143 . on the other hand , spiral galaxies demonstrate behavior opposite of the general trend for early - type galaxies , that is , an almost monotonically decreasing spiral fraction with increasing local background density .",
    "also , there is not much variation in the fractions of hubble stages and bar types of spiral galaxies along the local background density except for an increasing early spiral fraction and a decreasing late spiral fraction with increasing local background density in high - density regions , log ( @xmath144 .    to observe the dwarf morphology dependence on the local background density",
    ", we plot the distribution of the morphology fractions of dwarf galaxies as a function of the local background density in figure 23 .",
    "a clear difference in the morphology distribution can be seen between the two groups of dwarf galaxies .",
    "one group of dwarf galaxies ( de , dsph , and ds0 ) shows similar fractions with an increasing trend for the density ranges of log ( @xmath145 and become different fractions at the higher density regions .",
    "the other group ( de@xmath43 and de@xmath2 ) shows dominant fractions at local background densities less than the mean local background density .",
    "they comprise more than @xmath95 of the des galaxies at log ( @xmath146 , and decrease with increasing density to become the same fractions as those of the former group at log ( @xmath147 . the predominance of de@xmath2 galaxies in the low - density regions seems to reflect the environmental dependence of the star formation rate observed in the local universe , and higher star formation rate in the low - density regions @xcite , in accord with down - sizing @xcite .",
    "the high fraction of star forming dwarfs in the low - density regions is due to the dependence of collapse time ( @xmath148 ) of the pre - galactic cloud on the background density ( @xmath149 ) . in the low - density regions , a large amount of gas",
    "is left to make dwarf galaxies in the present epoch , including de@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "the preference for de@xmath43 galaxies in low - density regions can be understood if late gas accretion is the main cause of the central star formation in the isolaed de@xmath43 galaxies .",
    "although the local background density appears to be the primary parameter dictating the morphology of a galaxy , its role is different for giant galaxies and dwarf galaxies . for giant galaxies",
    ", it constrains the galaxy morphology through the star formation efficiency , which depends on the dynamical timescales ( @xmath149 ) at the initial collapse phase and the subsequent hierarchical merging phase of galaxy formation . in contrast , for dwarf galaxies , it constrains the interaction rates with giant galaxies . in cases of dwarf galaxies that are bound to giant galaxies as satellites ,",
    "the interaction rate is inversely proportional to the orbital period that is determined by the dynamical timescales .",
    "therefore , de , dsph , and dwarf lenticulars , which are likely to be located in the high - density regions , are supposed to lose their gas quickly due to the frequent interactions with large galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "de@xmath2 galaxies have fewer interactions than other de - like galaxies to retain their gas longer . in the case of the de@xmath43 ,",
    "the role of local background density seems to be complicated .",
    "since de@xmath43 are similar to de galaxies except for the blue core , their red color outside the nucleus suggests early removal of gas by frequent interactions with giant galaxies , but there is leftover gas in their environment to accrete the gas removed from des to make blue core .",
    "the morphologies of galaxies are affected by the neighboring galaxies .",
    "one of the measures of the influence of the neighbor galaxies is the projected distance , @xmath150 .",
    "this can be expressed in absolute units such as mpc , but @xmath151 , which is normalized by the neighbor s virial radius , is a good measure of the local environment because the morphology of a galaxy is affected significantly by the neighbor galaxy when it is located within the neighbor s virial radius @xcite . the virial radius of a galaxy is defined as the radius where the mean density inside the radius becomes the virialized density , which is set to 766 @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "the virial radius of a galaxy was calculated according to that described in @xcite .",
    "we derived @xmath150 of the 5836 local galaxies using the same neighbor search conditions as those applied to derive the local background density .",
    "figure 24 shows the frequency distribution of @xmath150 ( mpc ; upper panel ) and the scatter diagram of @xmath151 and @xmath150 ( mpc ) .",
    "the frequency distribution in the upper panel shows a very rapid decrease of number of galaxies with increasing @xmath150 .",
    "approximately @xmath153 of the local galaxies have a neighbor galaxy within @xmath154mpc and similar fractions of the local galaxies are located inside the virial radius of the nearest neighbor .",
    "owing to the rapid decrease of the frequency distribution of @xmath150 , the number of galaxies that have their nearest neighbors at @xmath155mpc is only 204 ( @xmath156 ) and it is reduced to 66 ( @xmath157 ) for @xmath158mpc . a good correlation is observed between @xmath151 and @xmath150 ( mpc ) with an upper envelope of an almost straight line .",
    "the scatter is caused by the wide range of virial radii of galaxies .",
    "the upper envelope is due to the smallest dwarf galaxies while the lower envelope is due to the largest giant galaxies . because of the small number of large giant galaxies , the lower envelope is not so straight as the upper envelope .",
    "figure 25 shows the fractional distributions of the morphological types as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "it is apparent that the majority of local galaxies are located within the virial radius of the nearest neighbor . among the morphological types of giant galaxies ,",
    "the elliptical galaxies are most likely located within the virial radius of the nearest neighbor , whereas more than half of the spiral and irregular galaxies are located outside the neighbor s virial radius .",
    "this means that the effects of hydrodynamical interactions with neighboring galaxies are more important in elliptical galaxies because hydrodynamical interactions are likely to be effective when a galaxy is located within the neighbor s virial radius .",
    "lenticular galaxies show an intermediate distribution between elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxies . among the de - like galaxies , de , dsph , and",

    "an examination of the morphology fractions of the 5 broad morphological types as a function of @xmath151 shows similar trends to those observed in figure 22 where the morphological fractions are plotted as a function of the local background density .",

    "figure 26 shows the early type fractions of the target galaxies as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "the early - type fractions of the target galaxies increase with decreasing @xmath151 .",
    "however , the increasing rates depend on the neighbor s morphology . here , early type represents three broad types of galaxy , e , s0 , and des , whereas late type represents spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "the early type fractions increase rapidly with decreasing @xmath151 when the neighbor galaxy is the early - type galaxy . whereas early - type fractions increase slowly with decreasing @xmath151 when the neighbor galaxy is a late type .",

    "this phenomenon was interpreted as morphological conformity between close neighbors @xcite . the gradual increase in the early - type fraction of the target galaxies with late - type neighbor when they come closer to the neighbor suggests that the effect of the tidal interactions dominates other interactions such as hydrodynamical interactions for gas transfer from the late - type neighbor to the target galaxy . in the case of early - type neighbors ,",
    "hydrodynamical interactions enhance the effect of tidal interactions by removing gas to produce a rapid increase in the early type fraction when they become closer to the neighbor .",
    "this paper presents a catalog of the morphological types of 5836 galaxies whose redshifts are less than @xmath19 .",
    "the morphological types are determined by a visual inspection of the color images provided by sdss dr7 .",
    "the majority of galaxies in the present sample come from the kias - vagc which is based on the spectroscopic target galaxies of the sdss dr7 complemented by the bright galaxies with known redshifts from various catalogs .",
    "galaxies fainter than the limiting magnitude of the sdss spectroscopic target galaxies were also included if redshifts are available in the ned .",
    "the number of galaxies fainter than @xmath1 is 809 which is approximately @xmath163 of the present sample .",
    "therefore , the present sample is not flux - limited but a flux - limited sample can be defined if galaxies brighter than @xmath1 are used because galaxies brighter than the sdss bright limiting magnitude of @xmath164 are believed to be compiled almost completely in the ned .",
    "the galaxy morphology classification system adopted for bright galaxies in the present study is basically the de vaucouleurs revised hubble - sandage system of stages and families @xcite .",
    "inner and outer ring varieties , lenses and stages of e and s0 galaxies are not recognized in our catalog . for dwarf galaxies , we use notation similar to @xcite , modified to allow for features , such as blue cores or blue colors , that are recognizable in color images .",
    "that is , we distinguish subtypes ; de , de@xmath43 , dsph , de@xmath2 , and dwarf lenticulars ( ds0 ) . the de , dsph and ds0 galaxies are further divided into de@xmath47 , de@xmath46 , dsph@xmath47 , dsph@xmath46 , ds0@xmath47 , and ds0@xmath46 to denote the presence of nucleation . in the analysis of the frequency distributions , however , we do not distinguish them because physical properties , such as the color and luminosity are similar , and the numbers of de@xmath47 and dsph@xmath47 galaxies are much smaller than those of de@xmath46 and dsph@xmath46 galaxies .",
    "the present catalog contains 85 elliptical galaxies ( e : 1.5% ) , 1093 dwarf elliptical - like galaxies ( des : 18.7% ) , 286 lenticular galaxies ( s0 : 4.9% ) , 1874 spiral galaxies ( sp : 32.1% ) , and 2498 irregular galaxies ( ir : 42.8% ) . since most irregular galaxies are dwarf galaxies , the local universe is dominated by dwarf galaxies . among giant galaxies , spiral galaxies",
    "dominate the local universe .",
    "the late - type spirals are more frequent than the early - type spirals and @xmath165 of spiral galaxies have bars including weak bars . a significant number of de@xmath2 galaxies , which are generally smaller than the ordinary de galaxies , are included in the present catalog .",
    "some de@xmath2 galaxies have large cores that are somewhat bluer than the global colors .",
    "most de@xmath2 galaxies without cores are quite compact , similar to hii region - like bcds .",
    "the only difference between these two types is the degree of star formation .",
    "hii region - like bcds are bluer than de@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "a considerable number of di galaxies show somewhat round shapes with size , luminosity , and color similar to de@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "their environments , represneted by the local background density , are also similar .",
    "therefore , we suppose that de@xmath2 galaxies are the same populations as di galaxies both of which served as the building blocks of giant galaxies .",
    "some evidence exists for dichotomy in the morphological properties of de galaxies and dsph galaxies , which is in contrast to the conventional practice to treat them as the same class of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the dichotomy is not as clear as that between the giant elliptical galaxies and the de galaxies in terms of size and luminosity .",
    "however , they are different in the surface brightness and color . the colors of the de galaxies are similar to those of giant elliptical galaxies , whereas they differ appreciably from dsph galaxies . the surface brightness and surface brightness gradient of dwarf elliptical galaxies are intermediate between the giant elliptical galaxies and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "if we consider the kinematic difference between dsph and de galaxies @xcite , the origins of dsph and de galaxies thought to be different , at least for the disperion - supported ds0 galaxies and the fast rotating de galaxies , dispersion - supported dsph galaxies can be promodial objects @xcite while fast rotating de galaxies are stripped late type spirals @xcite .",
    "we explored the physical properties , such as luminosity , color , size , and axial ratios , of the local galaxies .",
    "in general , distributions of the physical parameters of galaxies with different morphological types are quite different in terms of the most probable values and the shapes of their distributions .",
    "elliptical galaxies show the highest luminosity but their maximum size is smaller than that of spiral galaxies",
    ". the larger size of spiral galaxies is supposed to be due to the accretion of the intergalactic material after the collapse phase of galaxy formation .",
    "the luminosity and size distributions of the two types of dwarf galaxies , des and dir , are very similar , implying similar masses .",
    "the dependence of galaxy size and luminosity on galaxy morphology seems to have originated from the morphology - density relation because the local background density determines the dynamical timescales ( @xmath149 ) , which is closely related to the star formation rates .",
    "elliptical and lenticular galaxies that are likely to be formed in dense environment are assumed to build up their bodies rapidly , due to short dynamical times , without a late accretion phase , whereas spiral galaxies build up their outer parts by accreting intergalactic material after the initial collapse phase .",
    "this picture of spiral galaxy formation is in good agreement with the inside - out growth picture of spiral galaxies .",
    "although the local background density appears to be the primary parameter dictating the morphology of a galaxy , its role is different for giant galaxies and dwarf galaxies . for giant galaxies ,",
    "the local background density constrains the galaxy morphology through the star formation efficiency in the early phase of galaxy formation .",
    "in contrast , the local background density constrains the interaction rates between the host galaxies and their satellites , which are mostly dwarf galaxies because interaction rates are closely related to the orbital period that is determined by the dynamical timescales .",
    "therefore , we suppose that des , dsphs , and dwarf lenticulars , which are likely to be observed in the high - density regions , lose their gas quickly due to frequent interactions with large galaxies . on the other hand , de@xmath2 galaxies must have fewer interactions than other dwarf galaxies to keep their gas longer . in the case of the de@xmath43 ,",
    "the role of local background density is twofold .",
    "it is high enough for frequent interactions to remove gas from the galaxy but it allows delayed accretion of gas to the nucleus of the de galaxy to make the blue core .",
    "most of the local galaxies have nearby companion galaxies .",
    "the mean projected distance to the nearest neighbor @xmath166 is @xmath8kpc , which is similar to the virial radius of a bright spiral galaxy .",
    "approximately @xmath167 of the local galaxies have the nearest neighbor within @xmath168 .",
    "on the other hand , a considerable number of galaxies are extremely isolated .",
    "the number of extremely isolated galaxies depends on the isolation criteria .",
    "if @xmath169mpc is taken as the minimum projected separation between a target galaxy and its nearest neighbor , the number of extremely isolated galaxies is 113 but it becomes 66 if we consider @xmath158mpc as the criterion for the extreme isolation .",
