    "early - type galaxies ( etgs ) populate a two - dimensional surface in the space of parameters that reflect size ( effective radius ) , density ( mean surface brightness ) , and kinetic temperature ( velocity dispersion ) @xcite .",
    "a key feature of the fundamental plane ( fp ; @xcite ; @xcite ) is its deviation ( ` tilt ' ) from the virial theorem , which may be interpreted as a variation of the m / l ratio along the sequence of etgs and/or the breaking of homology assumption , i.e. the fact that , for all galaxies , the observed parameters have the same power - law dependence on the corresponding physical quantities ( namely , the central velocity dispersion on kinetic energy , the effective radius on ` gravitational ' radius , and the effective surface brightness on the overall light profile , see e.g.  @xcite ) . despite all the observational efforts ,",
    "the origin of the tilt is still under debate .",
    "the change of the m / l ratio can be explained by a change in either the stellar population ( e.g.  @xcite ) or dark matter content with galaxy mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "both structural and dynamical non - homology have also been invoked as physical explanations of the observed tilt ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite ) .",
    "recently ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* from now tbb04 ) showed that the tilt is mostly driven by dynamical and structural non - homology , while stellar populations account for only a small fraction of it .",
    "@xcite argued that the tilt is more likely because of a variation of the dark matter content with mass , still favoring a picture where stellar populations play a minor role .",
    "since the contribution of different stellar populations to galaxy luminosity is expected to be wavelength - dependent , while other effects ( e.g. non - homology ) are not , the dependence of the fp on wavelength directly informs on how properties of the stellar populations change with mass , which is a crucial point to understand galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "previous studies of the wavelength dependence led to contradictory results .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite found the tilt to significantly decrease from optical to nir wavelengths , interpreting this result as an increase of age and metallicity with mass .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite found only a small decrease of the tilt with wavelength , with the fp still being significantly tilted in the nir .",
    "however ,  @xcite , deriving the fp for etgs observed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , found evidence for the fp to be wavelength independent from the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 bands .",
    "several different effects can produce this puzzling picture .",
    "the fp in different wavebands has often been derived for small samples , with inhomogeneous measurements of galaxy parameters , different selection criteria ( e.g. galaxy samples spanning different ranges in magnitude and/or velocity dispersion ) , and with different fitting methods .",
    "the fp by  @xcite avoided all these problems by analyzing the same sample of galaxies at different wavebands , but it was limited to the short wavelength baseline provided by the sdss . in the present work , for the first time , we derive the fp by using the same , large , homogeneous sample of etgs over the wide wavelength baseline provided by the r- and k - band data of the sdss and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in sec .  2",
    ", we describe the selection of the sample , while sec .  3 details",
    "how we obtain the r- and k - band structural parameters , and the central velocity dispersions .",
    "4 deals with the comparison of the r- and k - band fps . in sec .  5",
    ", we show how the optical and nir fps constrain the variation of stellar population parameters along the galaxy sequence .",
    "the discussion follows in sec.6 . throughout the paper",
    ", we adopt the cosmology @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "we select a sample of etgs , with available k - band photometry from the second data release of ukidss , and r - band photometry and central velocity dispersions from the fifth data release ( dr5 ) of sdss .",
    "first , a complete volume - limited catalog of galaxies is defined , consisting of all the 105036 objects in dr5 with an r - band absolute magnitude m@xmath6 , and a spectroscopic redshift in the range of 0.05 to 0.095 .",
    "absolute magnitudes are obtained from the sdss r - band petrosian magnitudes , k - corrected to redshift @xmath7 by using the @xmath8 software  @xcite .",
    "the lower redshift limit is chosen to minimize the aperture bias  @xcite , while the upper redshift limit guarantees a high level of completeness ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "etgs are defined according to the sdss spectroscopic parameter @xmath9 , that classifies the spectral type on the basis of the principal component analysis technique , and the photometric parameter @xmath10 , which measures the fraction of galaxy light that is fitted by a de vaucouleurs law . following  @xcite",
    ", we define as etgs those objects with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , resulting in a list of 47061 galaxies . out of them , we retain only those 33628 galaxies with available central velocity dispersion , @xmath13 , between @xmath14 and @xmath15 kms@xmath16 .",
    "these cuts are required to obtain reliable @xmath13 s from the sdss - dr5 database .",
    "all the selected galaxies have spectra with median per - pixel @xmath17 larger than @xmath18 , which is a further requirement to retrieve reliable sdss velocity dispersions  .",
    "the sdss catalog is cross - matched with ukidss , resulting in 1570 galaxies .",
    "we notice that all the sdss galaxies with reliable velocity dispersion , that are covered by the ukidss survey , are then included in this sample . in other words ,",
    "the matching with ukidss does not change the magnitude limit of the present sample .",
    "we select only those galaxies observed in k - band images with good seeing ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this selection reduces the sample size by only @xmath20 , and excludes cases where structural parameters might be affected by large uncertainties .",
    "since all the r - band images have fwhm smaller than  @xmath21 and the galaxies in our sample have on average effective radii larger in the optical than in the k - band ( see below ) , we do not apply any seeing selection to the sdss photometry .",
    "the above procedure leads to a final sample of 1430 galaxies .",

    "@xcite derived @xmath87 ratios consistent with those obtained from the virial theorem in the assumption of homology , concluding that structural and orbital non - homology have a negligible role in the tilt of the fp ( see also  @xcite ) . in support to this view , they also showed that the variation of the dynamical @xmath87 is correlated with the h@xmath144 line - strength , thus ascribing most of the tilt to stellar population ( age ) effects .",
    "however , as the authors notice , this result strictly applies to their measurement of the velocity dispersion as the average over an aperture of radius equal to @xmath145 , a fact that alone might compensate part of the dynamical non - homology .",
    "moreover , most of the galaxies in their sample ( 68% ) are fast rotators , while five of them ( 20% ) have low velocity dispersion ( @xmath146=60 - 85 km s@xmath16 ) .",

    "@xcite showed that by replacing mean surface brightness with mass density , the fp relation closely approaches the virial theorem expectation , implying that most of the tilt is caused by a variation of dark matter content with galaxy mass .",
    "however , the uncertainties on their fp coefficients and the possible biases introduced by the gravitational - lens selection do not definitively exclude the contribution of non - homology to the fp tilt .",
    "our result agrees with @xcite regarding the minor role played by stellar populations on the tilt .",
    "tbb04 , agreeing with  @xcite and  @xcite , found that structural and dynamical non - homology can account for more than two - thirds of the fp tilt , with the remaining part being explained by stellar population effects . in particular , restricting the analysis to the magnitude - complete subsample , they found that the contribution of stellar populations to the tilt becomes negligible .",
    "notice also that their fps are derived from different sources , with significantly different coefficients in the optical and nir wavebands .    to understand how our results may be affected by the assumption of homology",
    ", we followed an approach similar to that of tbb04 , using spherical , isotropic , non rotating , one - component models of etgs following the sersic law ( see  @xcite ) . for each galaxy",
    ", we considered the model with the corresponding sersic index in the r - band , and used that model to correct the central velocity dispersion to the quantity @xmath147 ( defined as the square - root of the total specific kinetic energy ) , the effective radius to the gravitational radius , @xmath148 , and to calculate the mean surface brightness within the gravitational radius , @xmath149 .",
    "applying the orthogonal fit , we obtain the following equation of the fp in the k band : @xmath150 , which is remarkably close to the virial theorem expectation , implying that non - homology may account for the entire tilt . to explore",
    "how this result would affect stellar population properties , we normalized the r- and k - band fp coefficients in such a way to match the virial theorem expectation ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) in the k band .",
    "then , we derived the corresponding values of @xmath97 and @xmath96 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] ) . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlogt_dlogz ] , accounting for non - homology leads to the same @xmath97 and @xmath96 values as those derived under the assumption of homology if the tilt of the fp is not due to stellar populations ( i.e. @xmath109 ) . as discussed above ,",
    "this is consistent with what expected from the color - magnitude relation and absorption - line indices of etgs .    in summary",
    ", our analysis suggests a consistent picture where ( i ) the tilt of the fp does not originate from stellar population effects but is due to other effects , such as non - homology ; ( ii ) the sdss - ukidss fps require more massive galaxies to be mildly more metal rich than less massive systems , and to have extremely synchronized ages , with the age variation per mass decade being smaller than few percent .",
