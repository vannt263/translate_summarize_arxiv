    "we would like to know if agn really have accretion disks .",
    "predictions of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) are hard to make , and model dependent , and so are not a robust test .",
    "instead , i consider effects that test the generic idea of blackbody emission at a range of temperatures from a flat surface .",
    "from a tilted flat surface , we should see a standard @xmath0 dimming plus whatever atmospheric limb darkening effects might apply . for superluminal sources we can derive a fairly accurate viewing angle to the jet . for a sample of 21 such sources rokaki _",
    "et al _ ( 2002 ; see also these proceedings ) have measured the @xmath1 equivalent width ( ew ) , which gives the relative continuum brightness if the face on ew is always the same .",
    "the results show two separate effects . at small angles",
    "ew has a steep @xmath2 dependence , presumably due to relativistic jet beaming . at larger angles ,",
    "ew declines more gently with @xmath2 , and the simplest model , with @xmath0 dimming and standard thin disk limb darkening , fits extremely well .",
    "the data are not good enough to distinguish rival disk models , but the general idea of a flat tilted emitter is strongly endorsed .",
    "the seds of luminous quasars peak in the uv , roughly as expected for blackbody emission from around a billion solar mass black hole .",
    "( actually , observed seds are a little cooler than expected .. ) .",
    "the spectral index curves slowly from @xmath3 in the optical , through @xmath4 near the peak , and finally steepening to @xmath5 in the far - uv and onwards through the soft x - ray excess .",
    "( elvis _ et al _ 1994 ) .",
    "however lower luminosity seyfert galaxies often have @xmath6 , and dwarf agn have @xmath7 ( e.g. ho filippenko and sargent 1996 ; ho , these proceedings ) . in fact @xmath8 and @xmath9 change slowly and systematically with luminosity ( mushotzky and wandel 1989 ; zheng and malkan 1993 ; puchnarewicz _ et al _ 1996 ; see fig .",
    "this change is consistent with the big blue bump ( bbb ) shifting to lower frequency with lowering luminosity , from blue bump to green bump to red bump , in a manner reminiscent of a cooling blackbody .    of",
    "course accretion disks are not single blackbodies , but the sum of blackbodies .",
    "one can show that if an sed @xmath10 is made of the sum of blackbody emitting areas , and that each sub - area changes temperature by the same factor @xmath11 , then the new sed can be expressed in terms of the old one by the scaling formula @xmath12 ( lawrence 2002 in preparation ) .",
    "one expects accretion discs to behave just this way when varying accretion rate or central heating rate , and roughly this way when varying black hole mass , as long as one considers emission coming well away from the inner boundary . as a result ,",
    "if one has a template sed , then one can use the scaling formula to predict all other seds without having to know how the sed was made - i.e. whether it was from a thick disk , donut , flared disk , etc .",
    "the scaling simply tests the idea that the sed is made from the sum of blackbodies .    -0.2 cm    -0.2",
    "cm    i took two template seds - 3c273 , from kriss _ et al _ 1999 , and h1946 + 786 from kuhn _ et al _ 1995 - and calculated the expected @xmath8 vs luminosity track . the result is shown in fig . 1 and shows an impressive agreement remembering that this prediction has no adjustable parameters .",
    "it starts to break down at the low end , but this could easily be due to boundary conditions , or the effect of reddening etc .",
    "the extreme ends of the diagram require the controlling parameter , e.g. accretion rate , to vary by something like a factor of a million .",
    "seyfert galaxy optical - uv variations show the bbb getting bluer when brighter .",
    "do these variations also follow the sum - of - blackbodies scaling law ?",
    "1 indicates the low and high states of ngc 5548 , from peterson _",
    "et al _ 1991",
    ". clearly the colour variations are far too strong .",
    "a single black body track is almost this steep , but the wide range of temperatures needed to explain the sed produces a far flatter track .",
    "a possible explanation is that the colour changes result from mixing a variable blue component of approximately fixed shape with a static red component .",
    "perhaps then the @xmath13 locus we see in fig .",
    "1 represents a kind of baseline stable state for agn accretion discs heated by gravity / viscosity , with the thickness of the correlation caused by various degrees of mixing of a second variable component that has a different heating source .    from the point of view of accretion disc models , or indeed any models where the energy is generated through an extended structure , there are two problems with seyfert galaxy optical - uv variations .",
    "( i ) the timescale - months - is far shorter than the viscous timescale expected for stable accretion discs , which is hundreds of years .",
    "( ii ) variations occur simultaneously at different wavelengths , whereas emission at different wavelengths should arise at very different radii .",
    "fluctuations travelling at sound speed should then produce delays of order months .",
    "et al _ ( 1991 ) proposed that much of what we see is reprocessed radiation , so that fluctuations co - ordinate at light speed .",
    "that paper discussed optical fluctuations driven by uv , but most authors since have assumed that the variable uv itself is driven by variations in the observed x - ray source .",
    "the reprocessing idea seems to have been dramatically confirmed by observations of ngc  7469 , which shows that there _ are _ delays , but on a timescale of hours to days , and with delay varying as @xmath14 exactly as expected for a simple centrally heated disc model ( collier _ et al _ 1998 , wanders _ et al _ 1997 ) .",
    "so accretion discs score well on the brightness - angle test , and on the luminosity - colour test , but fail to match observed variations , unless we drop the idea of local gravitational heating and instead have a second heating source , which dominates in the uv regions , and which communicates across the disk at light speed . for some years",
    "the second heating source has generally been identified with the observed x - ray source . however , the x - ray heating model has two serious problems .",
    "first , simultaneous uv and x - ray observations of n7469 have not shown the expected correlation , with the x - ray emission if anything _ trailing _ the uv ( nandra _ et al _ 1998 ) .",
    "second , the x - ray luminosity is substantially less than the uv luminosity - by a factor of a few in low luminosity seyferts , and by a factor of twenty in quasars .",
    "we arrive then at the strange conclusion that agn accretion disks seem to be externally heated , but by an agent that we do not see .",
    "furthermore this mystery agent must carry most of the primary energy in agn .",
    "this then is the _ ghost in the machine_.    what else could heat the observed variable uv source ?",
    "if we require external heating at light speed , there would be seem two possibilities - an unseen radiation source , or particles .",
    "the most obvious radiation source is euv emission from the very inner disk . in observed terms",
    "there is just enough energy - essentially we are talking about the right hand side of the bbb heating the left hand side .",
    "however in flat discs , and even in flared discs , it is hard for the outer disc to see enough of the inner disc .",
    "( gravitational bending helps , but probably not enough ) .",
    "particles are an interesting and under - explored possibility .",
    "we want such particles to deposit their energy in the disc as heat before radiating , so protons are a much better bet than electrons . if they are not to cool on local electrons before hitting the disk , then they are probably high energy protons .",
    "one such possibility is virialised protons at @xmath15k from a two - temperature inner region , if a thin cold disc can co - exist with it .",
    "this possibility has been considered by spruit and hardt ( 2000 ) , although they assume that such protons heat an x - ray corona , which in turn heats the disc , rather than heating the cold disc itself .",
    "a second source of high energy protons could be from a standing shock near the black hole ( e.g. kazanas and ellison 1986 ) .",
    "it could well be that much of the accretion energy is generated in the `` plunging region '' inside 3@xmath16 , with most of the mass disappearing , but a large fraction of the energy being channelled into ultrarelativistic particles that escape . as these will follow field lines it is likely that most of these particles will end up in the disc .",
    "however they may lose most of their energy on the way , or at the skin of the disc , producing more gamma - rays than we observe .",
    "finally , bombardment by such particles may significantly alter abundances in the disc .",
    "skibo ( 1997 ) has in fact already argued that features in the wings of the x - ray fe line can be attributed to emission from just such enhanced abundances produced by cosmic rays .",
    "the above discussion assumes that the disc is _ externally _ heated , persuaded by the consistency of the time - delay versus wavelength result with the expected light - travel time .",
    "however the near - simultaneity of variations more generally drives us to drop the idea of distributed local heating .",
    "another possibility then is that much of the energy is generated near the black hole in some unknown form , and transmitted through the _ interior _ of the disc , perhaps by fast shocks , emerging at a larger radius as ( approximately ) nice simple black - body radiation .",
    "this makes an agn seem more like a star , but with a nastier geometry .",
    "probably in fact we need both local and central energy generation .",
