    "the column density at the peak of mm1-main reaches @xmath27@xmath28 , although the calculated maximal optical depth only reaches @xmath290.06 ( following equations 2 and 3 from @xcite ) . assuming a coupling of the gas and dust temperatures",
    ", we estimate that only the very central @xmath130mas ( milli - arcseconds ) diameter would be optically thick , hence we are dominated by optically thin emission .",
    "accounting for the uncertainties in the free - free spectral index and consistency with optically thin emission we emphasise that an estimated @xmath14 value of @xmath10.5 provides good evidence for larger dust grains as a consequence of grain growth @xcite .",

    "this breaks down for mm1-main in the central region as the column density divided by the statistical weight versus the energy level no longer follows a linear trend , and so we cap the temperature at 624k conforming to the upper energy level of the j=19@xmath018 k=8 line .",
    "with radex @xcite we can reproduce individual k - ladder line fluxes with temperatures @xmath5600k , column densities @xmath510@xmath30@xmath28 and densities @xmath510@xmath31@xmath32 , but for a fixed set of these parameters we can not reproduce the observed ratios between them .",

    "this is representative of the k=3 , 5 & 6 line emission , but not k@xmath57 which traces hotter gas closer to the central source in addition to decreasing in flux . compared to our previous sma observations",
    "we resolve the gas and find the kinematics are much more complex than the lower resolution observations might have indicated .",

    "clipping at @xmath13@xmath33 ( @xmath341.71mjybeam@xmath11 per 0.42kms@xmath11 ) we establish the velocity ranges from @xmath129 to 36.7kms@xmath11 in the blue shifted and @xmath139.6 to 42.8kms@xmath11 in the red shifted regimes ( limited at blue velocities by line contamination ) .",
    "the blue shifted emission highlights a linear jet - like structure although the red - shifted emission is more complex in shape .",
    "the pa of the central flow based on the linear blue - shifted emission is @xmath1120@xmath35 and is coincident with that of the larger scale co outflow @xcite and the near - ir reflection nebula @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the components s , nw , e , se and ridge , are embedded sources , filaments feeding the main core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or over - densities at the outflow cavity wall ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "considering the direction of the jet / outflow ( se@xmath0nw ) then one plausible description is that the extensions e and s ( curved line through main ) could form part of a blue - shifted cavity wall , whereas nw would form part of the red - shifted cavity wall .",
    "certainly the moment 1 map figure [ fig : fig1]c indicates the blue and redshifted emission is not confined only to the ne and sw but is co - located with the outflow direction se - nw @xcite .",
    "the moment 2 map also highlights the larger velocity dispersions in the region of the blue - shifted outflow direction tracing the cavity wall working surfaces .",
    "such a description corroborates the faint @xmath610percent level dust emission in the region of mm1-e and -s as from an outflow cavity .",
    "however figure [ fig : fig1]b indicates that s has additional dust emission and elevated temperatures consistent with central heating and also has broader emission lines comparable to those in mm1-main .",
    "a highly probably alternative scenario is that s is an embedded intermediate - high mass source providing the heating and velocity dispersion although it is not separated in the continuum emission .",
    "the mm emission from se appears in the path of the sio jet and can attributed to that from a thermal jet ` knot ' , as the mm emission is accounted for by the extrapolated free - free emission .",
    "such an interaction is supported by the elevated temperatures at the ` knot ' , although the line profile do not show outflow like wings and there is no sio contribution at this location .",
    "considering the lower limit of the free - free contribution to se at band 7 leaves some mm emission as from dust and assuming the free - free emission as a tracer of star - formation activity itself , we believe se could also be explained by an embedded self heating source .",
    "se is very rich in complex chemical species which may be more closely related to protostellar heating although these tracers could still be generated by grain sputtering due to outflow activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mm1-ridge could potentially harbour a protostellar source , or simply be an enhancement associated with the red - shifted outflow lobe .",
    "however , the whole structure has a clear velocity gradient ( figure [ fig : fig1]c ) from a blue - shifted velocity of @xmath137kms@xmath11 at the tail of the spiral shape to the south of ridge , near @xmath36 velocities flowing through ridge , and finally onto the north of mm1-main at red - shifted velocities @xmath141kms@xmath11 .",
    "based on these kinematics and the spiral structure we strongly suggest that it is a ` feeding ' filament drawing material from the reservoir to the south - west ( joined to mm2 ne and mm2 @xmath0 @xcite and in our continuum emission at the 5@xmath010percent flux levels ) . interestingly similar spiral - like structures were seen in the simulated images of @xcite who modelled the formation of a massive stars via discs .",
    "the spirals in their work feed and join the @xmath6500@xmath01000au size discs surrounding the compact , multiple cores formed in the dynamic environment .",
    "observations of the low - mass binary l1551 and the high - mass proto - cluster g33.92 indicate such accretion / infall spiral features maybe commonplace @xcite .",
    "we do not find a keplerian rotation signature at @xmath1500au resolution .",
    "the spectra of all the unblended lines of the ch@xmath4cn ladders in the region of mm1-main are not gaussian but are very broad .",
    "the profile averaged over the central 1000au appears double peaked , indicative of a velocity shift with position , hinting at an underlying rotation . under a naive assumption that the velocity shift is due to keplerian rotation we establish a rough stellar mass estimate after fitting the ch@xmath4cn lines at the flux peaks of the blue- and red - shifted emission separated by @xmath11000au in the ne - sw direction ( centroids at @xmath134.8 and @xmath142.5kms@xmath11 )",
    ". the central source would be at least 13m@xmath3 accounting for the inclination angle of @xmath150@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we can not exclude that this emission is from two separate components , possibly an unresolved binary system .",
    "the moment 2 map ( figure [ fig : fig1]d ) indicates the inner 500 - 600au region as a hive of activity where the velocity dispersion of exceeds 4kms@xmath11 and could point to the a disc on smaller scales that joins with the spiral ` feeding filament ' we see on the scales observed .",
    "we find the mm1 region is complex ; chemically , kinematically and morphologically . the enhanced cavity emission , other embedded sources and spiral ` feeding filament ' have unique kinematic signatures that could either mask a keplerian disc signature , or themselves inhibit the formation of a disc .",
    "the spiral structures in our observations appear very similar to those seen in the simulations of @xcite , which show the formation of a multiple - protostellar system via discs and feeding spirals . for w33a",
    "mm1-main the disc would be less than 500au in size as constrained by our observations .",
    "we present the highest resolution observations to date ( @xmath60.2@xmath2 , @xmath1500au ) of w33a mm1 at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "these resolve the emission surrounding the mm1 core into components associated with cavity wall emission , other possible protostars and a spiral shaped feeding filament .",
    "the ch@xmath4cn emission used to calculate the temperatures in the region indicate it is in excess of 600k for mm1-main .",
    "although there is some evidence of some rotational motions around the central o - type protostar , w33a mm1-main , there is no simple keplerian accretion disc on scales below 1000au as have been detected in similar sources .",
    "we find a spiral structure that , when considering models and other data , suggests a more dynamic environment where material could feed to a smaller scale @xmath6500au disc . the entire star forming region warrants a higher resolution study taking advantage of the alma @xmath115 km baselines .",
