    "the h - dibaryon is a doubly strange six - quark state with spin and isospin 0 . since its first prediction in 1977 @xcite",
    ", it has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies as a possible candidate of a strongly bound exotic state .",
    "the main question is whether its mass is lighter than the @xmath1 threshold , because such a light h - dibaryon is stable against strong decay .",
    "however , theoretical estimates of its mass have varied widely ranging from deeply bound to unbound , depending on the model or theory used for the calculations @xcite .",
    "experimentally , there is no conclusive result yet , although several candidates for an h - dibaryon decay have been reported @xcite .",
    "many efforts to search for the h - dibaryon are under way @xcite and planned . a double - hypernucleus event with a @xmath1 binding energy less than about 30 mev , has recently been found in an emulsion experiment at kek @xcite .",
    "this excludes the possibility of a deeply - bound h - dibaryon .",
    "the main dynamical factor responsible for a deeply - bound h - dibaryon is the color - magnetic interaction ( cmi ) in the one - gluon - exchange potential ( ogep ) .",
    "the cmi plays an important role in explaining the low - lying hadron spectra and the short - range part of the baryon  baryon interaction . in the h - dibaryon ,",
    "the cmi is attractive . on the other hand , it acts as a repulsive force for the nucleon - nucleon interaction and also for almost all nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "as is shown later , the cmi also generates a repulsive force between two h - dibaryons .",
    "another important factor determining the quark dynamics is the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it is known that the pauli principle gives repulsion for some channels of the nucleon  hyperon and hyperon  hyperon systems .",
    "furthermore , because of the color exchange character of the ogep , the cmi is only effective when the quark exchange interaction between different baryons is taken into account .",
    "quark exchanges between clusters can be correctly treated in the quark cluster model through the antisymmetrization of the wave function .",
    "therefore , we employ the quark cluster model to study the interaction between h - dibaryons in this paper .    assuming that the cmi plays a key role in determining the properties of the h ",
    "h interaction , tamagaki suggested the possibility that a new form of hadronic matter , called h - matter , appears at densities several times higher than normal nuclear density @xcite . in this pioneering study , a simple h ",
    "h interaction model consisting of a hard - core potential plus a square well attractive potential outside the core was used , because no microscopic calculation of the h ",
    "h interaction was available at that time .",
    "in the present study , we extract more quantitative information on the h ",
    "h interaction by employing the quark cluster model used in ref.@xcite . in this model",
    ", quarks are confined by an inter - quark potential and subject to the ogep @xcite .",
    "the medium range attraction is taken into account by an effective meson exchange potential ( emep ) between h - dibaryons . here",
    "we take only flavour singlet scalar meson exchange between the h - dibaryons into account . in the next section",
    ", we briefly explain the model used in the calculation and give the necessary matrix elements of the spin - flavor - color operators .",
    "the results of the calculation and the discussion of the properties of the h  h interaction are given in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary .",
    "in the present quark cluster model , the h - dibaryon wave function @xmath2 is assumed to be a ( 0s)@xmath3 configuration divided by the 0s wave function of the center - of - mass of the h - dibaryon with the size parameter @xmath4 for the orbital part , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the internal coordinate .",

    "the antisymmetrization operator @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the permutation operator . because each h - dibaryon consists of 6 quarks , there are 0,1,2 and 3 quark exchanges between h - dibaryons which are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : norm ] .",
    "because we symmetrize the two h  dibaryons system under a permutation of the two h - dibaryons , 4,5 and 6 quark exchanges are taken into account by the 0,1,2 and 3 quark exchanges and the exchange of the clusters as a whole .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath18 consists of the kinetic energy term , @xmath19 , and the interaction term , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the center - of - mass energy of the twelve - quark system , and @xmath24 here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the one - gluon - exchange potential ( ogep ) and the confinement potential , respectively : @xmath27 { \\mbox{\\boldmath",

    "it is important for the short - range behavior of the baryon - baryon interaction and also plays a crucial role in the short - range h ",
    "h interaction .",
    "flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the cmi is taken into account by using the parametrization : @xmath30 where @xmath31 when both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not an s - quark , @xmath34 when either @xmath32 or @xmath33 is an s - quark , and @xmath35 when both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are s - quarks .",
    "note that we take @xmath36 as an independent parameter , instead of being @xmath37 , which is straightforwardly expected from eq.([eq : ogep ] ) . as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we use here the parameter set which reproduces the experimental values of the mass splittings among @xmath1 , n@xmath38 and @xmath39 correctly .",
    "the other parameters entering ogep are determined from the experimental masses of octet and decuplet baryons @xcite .",
    "their values are reproduced here in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the equation that determines the relative wave function @xmath11 is called the resonating group method ( rgm ) equation . @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the normalization and hamiltonian kernel .",
    "these kernels are calculated as matrix elements of @xmath43 and @xmath18 using the wave function of eq.([eq : rgmwf ] ) .",
    "details on how to evaluate the normalization and hamiltonian kernels can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we show the spin - flavor - color ( sfc ) parts of the matrix elements . because the sfc parts of the h - dibaryon wave functions are totally antisymmetrized , it is sufficient to calculate the following matrix elements : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the sfc part of the shell model wave function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgmwf ] ) .",
    "there are 66 pairs interacting via the two - body interaction , @xmath49 , and they are classified into ten topologically different types of graphs as illustrated in fig . [ f : two ] .    to obtain , for a given number of quarks exchanged , the total contribution of each graph , we must multiply the matrix element in eq.([stcme ] ) by the number of ways of choosing the interacting pair without changing the structure of the graph and by the corresponding weight of the quark exchange operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asop ] ) . after multiplying these factors ,",
    "the matrix elements in sfc space can be written as @xmath50 in table [ t : ssll ] , the values @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 for each type of graph and each number of quarks exchanged are shown together with the multiplying factors .",
    "it is known that the ogep is not sufficient to describe the medium - range part of the baryon ",
    "baryon interaction , and that an attractive contribution arising from the meson cloud is also necessary .",
    "an effective meson exchange potential ( emep ) is introduced here as a force between h - dibaryons in order to simulate this meson contribution , although there are several works which introduce the meson exchange interactions as a force between quarks@xcite .",
    "the emep has previously been used to obtain a realistic description of the baryon  baryon interaction @xcite .",
    "we extend the emep to describe the flavor - independent scalar meson exchange interaction between h - dibaryons .",
    "there are more elaborate meson exchange potentials @xcite , where other scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges are included , in addition to the simple flavour - independent scalar meson exchange used here .",
    "we shall argue later that the neglect of other meson exchanges will not substantially affect the qualitative conclusions obtained in this paper .    here",
    "we introduce an emep which is assumed to be flavour - independent .",
    "since the emep is expressed as a function of the relative coordinate @xmath12 between the h - dibaryons , we here explain how we add the emep to the rgm equation in ( [ eq : rgmeq ] ) .",
    "first , we rewrite the rgm equation so that it has the same form as the usual schrdinger equation , albeit with a non - local hamiltonian . after introducing the renormalized h ",
    "h relative wave function , @xmath54 and the renormalized hamiltonian , @xmath55    n_{\\rm rgm}^{-1/2 } ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ' '' , { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ' ) , \\ ] ] the rgm equation is equivalent to the following non - local schrdinger equation : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the internal energy , and @xmath58 is the energy of the relative motion in the center - of - mass system . then we add the emep , @xmath59 , to the renormalized hamiltonian kernel @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 . for the emep , we take a gaussian - type function for simplicity , @xmath62    the parameters of @xmath59 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are obtained as follows . in the same manner as in ref.@xcite , we employ the direct convolution of the emep determined from the scattering length and effective range for the @xmath65 state of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , and obtain @xmath66 fm can be obtained by equating the fourier transform of the gaussian potential with that of the yukawa - type for small momentum transfer , i.e. , @xmath67 mev , which is not very far from the empirical @xmath68-meson mass . ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is fixed so that the possible range of the h - dibaryon mass is consistent with the double hypernucleus event found at kek @xcite , which is interpreted as @xmath69be or @xmath70b with a @xmath1 binding energy of @xmath71 or @xmath72 mev , respectively .",
    "the corresponding range obtained for @xmath64 is @xmath73 mev ( @xmath70b ) [ @xmath74 mev ( @xmath69be ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath75 mev is obtained by the direct convolution of the emep determined from the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction , which gives a rather large binding energy of the h - dibaryon from the @xmath1 threshold , 43.4 mev .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath64 are summarized in table [ emep ] .",
    "in this section , we show the numerical results obtained by solving the rgm equation including the emep with the parameters explained in the previous section .    in fig.[fig :",
    "eqlp ] , the equivalent local potentials of bound and scattering states and the adiabatic potential for @xmath76 mev are shown in order to appreciate the qualitative features of the h ",
    "h interaction , first .",
    "the equivalent local potential @xmath77 @xcite is defined as a potential which satisfies the following radial schrdinger equation : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the reduced mass and @xmath80 is the renormalized wave function obtained by solving the rgm equation with the non - local potential .",
    "the local potential obtained by this procedure is called the trivially equivalent local potential",
    ". we will discuss another way of defining the equivalent local potential later .",
    "the adiabatic potential @xmath81 is often used in order to get an idea in which regions of space repulsion and where attraction dominates .",
    "it is shown by the solid line in fig.[fig : eqlp ] .",
    "the adiabatic potential is the ratio of the diagonal element of the gcm ( generator coordinate method : see refs .",
    "@xcite ) hamiltonian kernel to the gcm normalization kernel .",
    "@xmath82 here the value at infinite h  h separation is subtracted , so that the @xmath81 goes to zero as @xmath83 .",
    "the gcm normalization and hamiltonian kernels are the overlap and the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath18 with a ( 0s@xmath84 configuration for each h - dibaryon , where the origins of the two h - dibaryons are separated by a distance @xmath85 . because the origin is not the center - of - mass of the h - dibaryon , the adiabatic potential represents a smeared h ",
    "h potential , where the center - of - mass of each h - dibaryon fluctuates .",
    "although the local and the non - local parts of the potential are smeared out , the range of the fluctuations is sufficiently small to reflect the short - range repulsion due to the effect of the exclusion principle and the cmi .",
    "we see from fig.[fig : eqlp ] that the cmi leads to a strong short - range repulsion .",
    "the short range part of the eqlp , which is due to the cmi has an energy - dependent repulsion , i.e. , the second bound and scattering states feel a stronger repulsion at short distances than the ground state .",
    "this energy - dependence is the typical one also seen in the nucleon  nucleon potential @xcite .",
    "this behavior is shown to be partly due to the non - locality of the potential @xcite . in the region below @xmath86 fm ,",
    "the contribution from the ogep has not yet died out and the eqlp still differs from the emep in the medium - range although the emep dominates there .",
    "furthermore , the energy dependence seems to be reversed compared to the one at short distances .",
    "namely , at short distances , the low energy state has a weaker repulsion than the high energy state , whereas at long range , the repulsion for the low energy state becomes stronger than the one for the high energy state . if we employ the usual procedure @xcite to obtain the energy - dependent local potential from the non - local one , the ordering of the energy - dependence would be the same for short distances and long distances .    our results for the energy - dependence of the h ",
    "h interaction can be understood in the following way . in the interacting region ,",
    "the wave function @xmath80 for the attractive non - local potential is suppressed compared with the wave function @xmath87 determined from the energy dependent local ( edl ) potential .",
    "@xmath88 where @xmath89 is the @xmath85-dependent effective mass @xcite .",
    "this is known as the perey - buck effect @xcite . in order to obtain the energy - dependent equivalent local potential",
    ", we should use @xmath87 . in the actual calculation , however , we have employed @xmath80 instead of @xmath87 .",
    "then the kinetic energy given by the second derivative of the wave function @xmath80 differs from the one for @xmath87 .",
    "this is the main reason for the different energy dependences at short and long distances .",
    "the binding energy of the h  h system as a function of the parameter @xmath64 is shown in fig.[fig : be ] .",
    "h system is a strongly self - binding system in the range , @xmath90 mev , and its binding energy in the ground state is 100@xmath0170 mev .",
    "even a second bound state , which is also an s - wave state , appears in the range @xmath91 mev .",
    "this is also seen from the divergent behavior of the h ",
    "h scattering length @xmath92 as a function of @xmath64 shown in fig.[fig : scattlen ] , and from the change of the s - wave phase shifts with @xmath64 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "fig.[fig : hardcore ] shows the equivalent hard - core radius @xmath93 , which is defined as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the phase shift , and @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath97 goes to zero , the value @xmath93 coincides with the scattering length . for comparison ,",
    "we show @xmath93 for the case without emep .",
    "for @xmath98 @xmath99 , @xmath93 is determined mainly from the repulsive core , and is of the order of 1 fm .",
    "the wave function of the lowest bound state , @xmath100 , is shown for @xmath76 mev in fig.[fig : wf ] .",
    "because of the strong repulsive core , the peak of the wave function is around 0.7 fm in spite of the large binding energy of the h  h system .",
    "the wave function is clearly localized around the minimum of the eqlp . in order to see the effect of the renormalization , the unrenormalized wave function , @xmath101 , which does not contain the factor @xmath102 ,",
    "is also shown .",
    "the differences between the renormalized and unrenormalized wave functions can be understood as follows .",
    "the square root of the normalization kernel is expanded in terms of the harmonic oscillator wave functions , @xmath103 , with the size parameter @xmath104 as @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is the eigenvalue of the normalization kernel , @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath109 is zero for the s - wave interaction .",
    "if @xmath110 for all @xmath111 in the expansion of eq.([eq : sqrtn ] ) , the left - hand side becomes @xmath95-function , @xmath112 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath106 from 1 is due to the quark exchanges between the h - dibaryons .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath106 are @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "the large contributions from @xmath114 and @xmath116 cause the enhancement of the amplitude around the origin and the suppression at intermediate range by the renormalization .",
    "these results are obtained by employing the simple flavor - singlet emep .",
    "therefore , further examinations are required especially concerning the validity of the flavor independent emep . here",
    ", we wish to make a brief comment on the use of the emep which is taken to simulate a flavor singlet scalar meson exchange .",
    "recently , more elaborate nucleon - hyperon interactions based on the su(6 ) quark model @xcite have been suggested . in ref .",
    "@xcite , flavor - octet scalar meson exchanges are also included , in addition to the flavor - singlet scalar meson . although we do not take into account the octet mesons in the present calculation , we qualitatively discuss their effect on the h ",
    "the potential due to the flavor - octet scalar - meson exchange has the following structure : @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are flavor su(3 ) operators for baryons 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "this form is based on the su(6 ) quark model . in general , there are two types of meson - baryon couplings , which are called f and d. it is known that the f type coupling , which gives the above flavor - dependence for the baryon ",
    "baryon interaction , is dominant for scalar meson exchanges @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of the flavor operator for the h - dibaryon is given as follows .",
    "@xmath120 here , we have used that @xmath121 for the h - dibaryon and that the h - dibaryon consists of flavor - octet baryons for which @xmath122 is 12 .",
    "thus , the contributions from the flavor - octet scalar - meson exchanges in the h - dibaryon are repulsive because the radial part @xmath123 is always attractive for scalar meson exchanges . as a result ,",
    "if we include the flavor - octet mesons and fix the strength of the emep from the binding energy of the h - dibaryon , the strength of the flavor - singlet part becomes more attractive than in the present calculation without the flavor - octet mesons .",
    "for the h ",
    "h system , the flavor - octet meson exchanges do not contribute because the h - dibaryon is a flavor su(3 ) singlet . therefore ,",
    "if the flavor - octet mesons were included , the h  h system would be more strongly bound .    for the nucleon - nucleon system ,",
    "octet scalar meson exchange is attractive in the @xmath65 channel .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the strength of the flavor - singlet part of the emep derived from the nucleon  nucleon potential is decreased compared to the case without octet mesons . on the other hand , as discussed before , the strength of the flavor - singlet part of the emep as derived from the binding energy of the h - dibaryon is increased when the octet mesons are taken into account .",
    "thus , the strengths derived from the nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering data on one hand , and from the h - dibaryon binding energy on the other hand , would become similar when we include the octet scalar meson exchanges . recall that without the octet scalar mesons , the emep derived from nucleon - nucleon scattering was more attractive ( @xmath124 mev ) than the emep derived from the limits on the binding energy of the h - particle ( @xmath125 mev @xmath126 @xmath127 mev ) .    finally , we comment on the effect of pseudoscalar meson exchange .",
    "the pseudoscalar meson exchanges do not contribute to the h ",
    "the contribution from pseudoscalar meson exchanges to the binding energy of the h - dibaryon is known to be about 5 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , even if we take into account the pseudoscalar meson exchanges , there is no drastic change for the binding energy of the h  h system .",
    "thus , the conclusion that the h ",
    "h system has a strong medium - range attraction leading to a bound state remains unchanged .",
    "a bound state of two h - dibaryons is also obtained in the skyrme model@xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the  tetralambda \" state is @xmath128 mev , which is smaller than the value obtained in our calculation .    finally , we comment on the implications of our results for the occurrence of h - matter .",
    "tamagaki @xcite discussed the possibility of a phase transition from neutron matter to h - matter at a density which is 6@xmath09 times greater than the normal nuclear density @xmath129 . in tamagaki s calculation , the h - dibaryons interact via a hard core potential and an attractive square well potential outside the core . in their work",
    ", the depth of the attractive potential was assumed to be so weak that it can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the depth of the square well potential has been determined as the value where the scattering length becomes zero for the first time , when the strength of the attractive potential is gradually increased , i.e. as the limiting strength that still gives a positive scattering length .",
    "the pertinent strength parameter corresponding to our emep can be obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : scattlen ] .",
    "it is found to be @xmath130 mev .",
    "thus the attraction used in ref .",
    "@xcite is much weaker than the one used in the present calculation . if the attractive h ",
    "h potential is indeed as strong as the emep employed in the present calculation , the critical transition density beyond which h - matter formation is energetically favorable may be appreciably lower .",
    "however , a quantitative estimate is not simple because of the inapplicability of perturbation theory under a strong attractive potential as in the present calculation .",
    "a recalculation of the critical transition density for h - matter formation is beyond the scope of the present work ( see however ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated the interaction between two h - dibaryons in the quark cluster model with a one - gluon - exchange and quadratic confinement potential between constituent quarks .",
    "in addition , a phenomenological attractive meson exchange potential between h - dibaryons is used .",
    "the parameters employed for the calculation are determined so as to reproduce the octet and decuplet baryon ground state masses and from the requirement that the h - dibaryon mass is consistent with the observed binding energy of two @xmath131 s in a double hypernucleus .",
    "these parameters were also used in our previous work on the n  h interaction @xcite . in our calculation , the effective scalar meson exchange potential is assumed to be a flavor su(3 ) singlet .",
    "we have presented a qualitative discussion on the effects of octet scalar mesons and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we conclude that the following properties of the h ",
    "h system remain unchanged even if we include the octet scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the main properties of the interaction between h - dibaryons can be characterized as a short - range repulsion due to pauli blocking and the color - magnetic interaction , and a medium - range attraction due to flavor singlet scalar meson exchange . as a result of the present rgm calculation",
    ", we have obtained a strongly - bound state of two h - dibaryons with a separation about 0.8 @xmath0 0.9 fm due to the strong repulsive core .",
    "the present results suggest that the critical density at which the formation of h - matter becomes energetically favorable may be lower than the value @xmath132 found in ref .  @xcite",
    ". this would have interesting astrophysical consequences . in the framework of the walecka model",
    ", it has recently been shown @xcite that with the present h ",
    "h interaction , h - matter is unstable against compression .",
    "thus , if the central density of a massive neutron star exceeds the critical density for h - matter formation , the energetically favorable compression of h - matter provides a possible scenario for the conversion of a neutron star into a strange quark star .",
