    "in recent years investigation of complex systems with regard to their fractal properties has become one of the elementary methods of such systems analysis  @xcite .",
    "multifractal structures were identified in systems from various areas such as physics  @xcite , biology  @xcite , chemistry  @xcite , economics  @xcite and even music  @xcite .",
    "a simple consequence of this fact is both popularization of the existing methods of multifractal analysis and proposing new , even more advanced methods . among the problems the multifractal analysis faces",
    "is coping with a trend present in analysed data  @xcite .",
    "this is because typically only the signal fluctuations have to be considered .",
    "in such a case , a trend should be eliminated by using one of the detrending methods , which is best suited for a particular kind of the trend .",
    "the simplest and most popular way of detrending is to remove the trend with a definite functional form .",
    "however , identifying precise functional form of the trend becomes very difficult or even impossible if the data is nonstationary .",
    "moreover , the trend can itself depend on the considered time span .",
    "thus , in practice it often happens that detrending is nothing else but taking the functional form ad hoc and subtracting it from the analysed signal .",
    "unfortunately , this can lead to spurious findings and their erroneous interpretation .",
    "one of the most popular methods of the multifractal analysis is multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa )  @xcite . within its framework",
    ", the supposed trend is removed from time series before multifractal spectra are calculated .",
    "the trend is represented by a polynomial with chosen degree . however , as it was mentioned above , a choice of the detrending polynomial order is crucial . using a polynomial of",
    "too high order can result in suppressing part of the low - frequency fluctuations which are erroneously identified as a part of the trend .",
    "on the other hand , polynomial of too low order does not eliminate non - stationarity sufficiently .",
    "this problem was discussed in ref.@xcite where several types of trends and their influence on fractal characteristics of data were considered .    in this paper , we systematically study the multifractal characteristics of different signals by means of the mfdfa method with different orders of the detrending polynomials .",
    "we consider both the mathematical multifractals and the multifractal time series coming from real - world observables or generated by a computer .",
    "the diversity of the considered signals ensures that our study is comprehensive and not restricted to one type of correlations only .",
    "the primary multifractal characteristics we apply here is the singularity spectrum and its derivatives .",
    "the mfdfa procedure was proposed by kantelhardt _",
    "et al . _ in  @xcite and is one of the most frequently applied algorithms of calculating the multifractal spectra .",
    "its popularity owes to , among other , the simplicity of its implementation and the reliability of obtained results in the case of non - stationary time series . in this method ,",
    "one calculates the signal profile first : @xmath2\\ \\",
    "j=1 ... n , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes averaging over time series .",
    "then this profile is divided into @xmath4 disjoint segments @xmath5 of length @xmath6 starting both from the beginning and the end of the series . for each box ,",
    "the trend is estimated by fitting a polynomial @xmath7 of order @xmath8 .",
    "next , this trend is subtracted and variance of the detrended data is calculated inside each segment : @xmath9 finally , the @xmath10th - order fluctuation function is derived according to the equation : @xmath11^{q/2}\\rbrace^{1/q},\\ ] ] where _ q _ can take any real value except zero . in this paper",
    ", we restrict @xmath10 within the range @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure is repeated for different segments lengths @xmath6 .",
    "if the analysed signal is fractal , then @xmath13 scales within some range of @xmath6 according to a power law : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the generalized hurst exponent . for a monofractal signal ,",
    "@xmath15 is independent of @xmath10 and equals the hurst exponent @xmath16 . on the other hand , for a multifractal time series , @xmath15 is decreasing function of @xmath10 and the ordinary hurst exponent is obtained for @xmath17 .",
    "the multifractal spectrum can be calculated by means of the following relation : @xmath18 + 1 , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the strength of a singularity and @xmath20 is the fractal dimension of a points set with particular @xmath19 . for a multifractal time series ,",
    "the shape of the singularity spectrum is similar to a wide inverted parabola .",
    "the left and right wing of the parabola refers to the positive and negative values of @xmath10 , respectively . for pure multifractals",
    "the lower is the value of @xmath19 the higher moment is considered .",
    "the maximum of the spectrum is located at @xmath21 . for a monofractal signal",
    ", @xmath20 shrinks to one point .",
    "the richness of the multifractal is evaluated by the width of its spectrum : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand for the extreme values of @xmath19 .",
    "the larger is @xmath25 , the more rich is dynamics and the more developed is the multifractal .",
    "it is worth mentioning that mfdfa method can be easily connected with classical multifractal formalism in which multiscaling properties are characterized by a partition function  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 stands for measure ( or the box probability ) covering the segment @xmath5 of size @xmath6 and @xmath10 is the same parameter as in case of mfdfa method .",
    "the fluctuation function can be related to the partition function according to the formula : @xmath28^{q/2}\\ ] ] in case of fractal time series we expect scaling relation similar to eq . [ wzor1 ] : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is called scaling exponent . for a monofractal time series",

    "a similar situation is observed for the forex data , where the effect of detrending on the richness of multifractality is characteristic for individual exchange rates .",
    "these outcomes show that one of the basic multifractal characteristics i.e. width of the singularity spectrum also depends on assumed form of a trend . in practice , within the mfdfa method , a polynomial of order two is the most frequently used . however , as the results for binomial cascade suggest , in some cases , a polynomial of higher order can give us more accurate fractal characteristics .",
    "moreover , different kinds of trend could describe different parts of a signal .",
