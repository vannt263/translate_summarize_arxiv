    "the search for the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the most important challenges facing particle physics today .",
    "detailed studies of the feasibility of signal for higgs bosons have been undertaken in this area for both hadron and for @xmath5 colliders .",
    "the possibility of creating a photon - photon collider by compton backscattering laser beams off electron beams has attracted much attention recently .",
    "these machines would provide collisions of photons at energies almost as high as the parent @xmath5 colliders , leading to recent interest in the possibility of detecting higgs bosons at photon - photon colliders@xcite .",
    "this also offers the possibility that the higgs - photon - photon coupling can be measured , and so provides an indirect probe of new physics because any new charged particle that couples to the higgs will contribute@xcite .",
    "while the photon - photon luminosity via the weizsacker - williams spectrum falls rapidly with increasing diphoton mass , the possibility of using backscattered laser beams provides a flat luminosity or even a luminosity which grows with energy almost all the way to the energy of the parent @xmath5 collider .",
    "the @xmath1 loop contribution to @xmath0 has been calculated recently in a nonlinear gauge by jikia@xcite who found a large cross section for transverse @xmath2 s .",
    "we have performed an independent calculation of this process in the feynman gauge ( @xmath6 with @xmath7 ) .",
    "we find a total cross section as well as contributions from individual helicity modes to be in good numerical agreement with the results of jikia .",
    "we are also in good numerical and analytic agreement with glover and van der bij who have calculated and published the matrix elements for @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this result can be immediately translated into the fermion loop contribution for @xmath0 with the appropriate coupling replacements for the quarks and including the charged leptons .",
    "most studies of higgs detection at photon - photon colliders have neglected the irreducible continuum background of @xmath2 pairs that arise from @xmath1 boson and fermion loops .",
    "the signal obtains its largest contribution from @xmath1 loops , and the explicit calculation of the continuum background presented here and in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the contribution to the background from almost all the helicity modes is dominated by the @xmath1 boson loops as well .",
    "the calculation required is straightforward but very lengthy .",
    "there are 188 one - loop diagrams with @xmath1-boson loops in the @xmath6 gauge .",
    "these are shown in figure 1 ; the mixed coupling between the photon , the charged goldstone boson , and the @xmath1 boson is present in this gauge .",
    "the higgs pole appears in the diagrams in figure 1b .",
    "we have performed the calculation with the symbolic manipulation programs form and mathematica using the tensor integral reduction algorithm of van  oldenborgh and vermaseren@xcite .",
    "we obtain analytic expressions for each helicity amplitude , offering the possibility of including the full spin correlations of the decay products of the @xmath2 bosons as well as arbitrary polarization of the incident photon beams .",
    "the result was derived for on - shell @xmath2 bosons , so it can be used for any energy above threshold @xmath9 .",
    "jikia presented the cross sections producing transverse and longitudinal @xmath2 bosons . in this paper",
    "we present the cross sections of each helicity mode of the @xmath2 s separately .",
    "we have investigated the feasibility of detecting a heavy higgs at a photon - photon collider by convoluting the cross section with a realistic photon - photon luminosity from backscattered laser beams .",
    "we present cross sections for the higgs signal and the continuum background .",
    "we have assumed a top quark mass of @xmath10 gev throughout this paper .",
    "there are twelve independent cross sections .",
    "the contribution to the total cross section from each helicity amplitude will be denoted @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the helicities of the photons and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the helicities of the @xmath2 bosons .",
    "the cross sections for the helicity amplitudes with equal photon helicities are shown in figures 2a , 2b , and 2c for higgs masses of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 gev respectively .",
    "only three of the amplitudes ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) receive a contribution from the higgs pole . the peaks for the heavier higgs or not as pronounced as the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite since we are using a top quark mass of @xmath10 gev rather than @xmath22 gev for which the destructive interference between the @xmath1 boson loops and the top quark loops to the higgs peak is more severe .",
    "the other amplitudes are independent of the higgs mass .",
    "there is interference between the higgs pole and the continuum background that is constructive below the higgs peak and destructive above .",
    "the cross sections for the helicity amplitudes with unequal photon helicities is shown in figures 2d .",
    "the contributions from the other helicity modes to the cross section are related by @xmath23    the cross sections @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not strictly equal , but the numerical agreement is very close .",
    "a similar statement applies to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the large cross section from the @xmath1 boson loop arises in the helicity modes @xmath28 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "these contributions reproduce the large cross sections for transverse @xmath2 pairs at large @xmath29 first found by jikia .",
    "for equal photon helicities the total cross section is dominated by @xmath28 in the large energy domain .",
    "likewise , the asymptotic value for the cross section in the case of opposite photon helicities is given by the sum of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these are the same helicity amplitudes that dominate the tree level scattering @xmath30@xcite .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are large because they grow logarithmically with energy even at fixed scattering angle .",
    "this is unlike the contribution from fermion loops which approaches a constant at fixed scattering angle .",
    "for example , the largest helicity amplitude @xmath31 is given asymptotically ( @xmath34 ) by @xmath35\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the two straight scalar boxes and @xmath38 is the crossed scalar box ( see e.g. the first paper in ref .",
    "@xcite for the functional form of these scalar integrals in terms of dilogarithms and elementary functions ) .",
    "this amplitude is concentrated in the forward - backward directions at large energies , and is also logarithmically growing at large energies at fixed scattering angles .",
    "the total cross section is the sum of the contribution from the individual modes . branching fractions for the subsequent decays of the @xmath2 bosons",
    "have not been included in the figures or tables .",
    "for unpolarized photons there is a factor of one half from averaging over the initial helicities . in figures 3 and 4",
    "the sum of the contributions from all helicity modes is shown for unpolarized photons with an angular cut @xmath39 on the @xmath2 bosons .",
    "we emphasize that the angular cut is not particularly effective at reducing the continuum background at @xmath40 gev where the background is fairly flat in @xmath41 .",
    "the angular cut causes the cross section to begin to fall but only in the range @xmath42 gev , unlike the process @xmath43 where a modest cut can reduce the transverse @xmath1 background by an order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "the prominence of the higgs peak is reduced as the higgs mass increases ; coupled with the rapid rise of the @xmath44 background , the viability of @xmath45 for detecting a heavy higgs boson deteriorates rapidly with increasing higgs mass .    the peak cross section of the signal after subtracting out the underlying background is in close agreement with the approximate form given by the pole approximation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total higgs width .",
    "the shape of the signal is changed somewhat due to interference with the underlying continuum background ; there is constructive interference below the peak and destructive interference above the peak ( see figures 2 , 3 , and 4 ) .",
    "this interference tends to be larger for the heavier higgs where the signal is less dominant over the background .",
    "one sees from figure 4 that as the higgs mass rises from @xmath48 to @xmath49 gev , the decreasing prominence of the higgs peak together with the increasing underlying continuum production of @xmath2 s causes the background to become larger than the signal . to obtain event rates one must multiply by the @xmath2 appropriate branching fractions and include the photon - photon luminosity distribution",
    "however , one can already deduce that for a higgs as heavy as @xmath49 gev , one needs a large number of events since the background is over three times the size of the peak at its maximum .",
    "a brief comment can be made here about the higgs bosons of extended higgs sectors and about supersymmetric higgs bosons .",
    "extra contributions enter into the loop , e.g. the charged higgs loops , the squark loops , and chargino loops must be included .",
    "these contributions , however , can be deduced from subsets of the calculation already performed in the standard model",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "in such cases , we believe this background is still typically large .",
    "the results of the previous section were presented with respect to the invariant mass of the photons . to understand the event rates at a realistic photon - photon collider one must incorporate the spectrum of photons obtained from compton backscattering a laser beam off the electron beam .",
    "we assume the photon beams obtained are unpolarized , thus giving a broad and largely flat luminosity distribution up to approximately 80% of the energy of the @xmath5 collider .",
    "we consider three such electron colliders with energies of @xmath50 gev , @xmath51 tev , and @xmath52 tev .",
    "the photon - photon luminosity is given by@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 and for unpolarized photons @xmath55\\ ; , \\\\",
    "d(\\xi ) & = & \\left ( 1-{4\\over \\xi}-{8\\over { \\xi ^2}}\\right ) \\ln ( 1+\\xi ) + { 1\\over 2}+{8\\over \\xi}-{1\\over { 2(1+\\xi ) ^2}}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the dimensionless parameter @xmath56 we take the conversion coefficient @xmath57 to be one",
    ". the energy of the laser beam can not be too large , or it would be possible to create electron - positron pairs from an interaction between the laser beam and the backscattered photon .",
    "so we take the dimensionless parameter @xmath58 is taken be 4.82 as usual ( @xmath59 ev for a 500 gev @xmath5 collider ) the maximum value of the fraction of the incident electrons s energy carried by the back - scattered photon , @xmath60 , is then @xmath61 the luminosity integral in eq .",

    "the cross section is then the convolution of this luminosity with the helicity amplitudes @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the minimum and maximum of the energy range to be integrated over . to increase the statistical significance of the higgs peak we integrate over from @xmath68 ( we assume that there is sufficient resolution so that @xmath69 even for a higgs as light as @xmath48 gev ) so that @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "a factor of one - half is included to convert these contributions from each helicity mode for unpolarized photon beams because of averaging over the photon helicities .",
    "on the other hand for perfectly polarized photons , one would consider only the modes with equal photon helicities ( @xmath72 ) yielding an extra factor of 2 in the signal@xcite .",
    "unfortunately this also yields a factor two in the largest part of the @xmath44 background , namely @xmath28 .",
    "however we expect some improvement from the unpolarized case since the background @xmath24 and @xmath25 would be reduced .",
    "another improvement arises from the fact that the polarized photon - photon luminosity can peak more strongly than the unpolarized luminosity .",
    "the cross sections in femtobarns is given in tables 1 - 4 with the angular cut on the @xmath2 s of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 in the center - of - mass system .",
    "three value of the higgs mass are considered : @xmath16 , @xmath77 , and @xmath49 gev ) .",
    "this range of masses completely covers the region where the higgs signal is much larger than the continuum background ( @xmath16 gev ) to the region where the signal is much smaller than the background ( @xmath78 gev . both the signal and background for the 400 gev higgs is somewhat reduced at the 500 gev @xmath5 collider , since part of the peak extends past the range of the photon - photon luminosity , @xmath79 .",
    "the event rates can be obtained from the figures by incorporating the branching fractions of the @xmath2 pairs to some final state .",
    "the four - jet decay may be difficult because of the huge @xmath43 process at tree level , so one can have one of the @xmath2 s decay leptonically .",
    "for example , consider the decay mode@xcite @xmath80 with a branching fraction of @xmath81",
    ". with an integrated luminosity of @xmath82 one has 20 signal events and 5.9 background events for a @xmath48 gev higgs at a @xmath17 gev parent @xmath5 collider employing an angular cut @xmath83 , while one has 8.6 signal events and 14 background events for a @xmath77 gev higgs boson . for a @xmath49 gev higgs",
    "the situation is even worse , giving just 2.9 signal events and 14 background events .",
    "there are other backgrounds that have been considered@xcite in this channel , e.g. @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 with subsequent decay of the top quarks . using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we can estimate that the irreducible continuum background is larger than the sum of these backgrounds for @xmath87 gev with a reasonable angular cut .",
    "a higher energy collider will not improve the situation . while the reach of the collider would be greater , less of the photon - photon luminosity",
    "would be devoted to the region of the higgs peak @xmath88 for the higgs masses of interest , @xmath89 gev . for heavier higgs boson",
    "the continuum background is simply overwhelming .    from the tables ,",
    "it is evident that the angular cut is not effective at eliminating the large @xmath44 background .",
    "this is a different result than that obtained in the process @xmath43 for which the asymptotic cross section is also predominantly front - back and a modest angular cut @xmath90 reduces cross section by over an order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath44 continuum is rather flat in the range of interest here , @xmath91 gev . for larger @xmath92 tev",
    "the front - back behavior becomes more evident and the angular cut has a pronounced effect ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "it is possible that the ability to see the higgs peak above the @xmath93 background can be improved by employing more refined techniques@xcite .",
    "polarized photons have been discussed above .",
    "cuts on the decay products of the @xmath2 s can be used to enhances the longitudinal component of the signal over the transverse background .",
    "these issues are subject for future study .",
    "since we have obtained the individual helicity amplitudes , we can incorporate the decay density matrices for the @xmath2 bosons and recover the full spin correlations of the decay products . in any case",
    ", the background is growing very rapidly with energy and it seems unlikely that these methods could change the basic conclusion that the higgs is unobservable above @xmath94 gev in its @xmath95 decay mode .    an interesting corollary to this result is that photon - photon scattering @xmath96 should show the same behavior at very high energies , @xmath97 . the same helicity amplitudes should eventually grow with energy .",
    "we are currently incorporating the decay density matrices for the @xmath2 bosons .",
    "we have confirmed the large @xmath93 production from photon - photon collisions at high energy .",
    "an angular cut on the @xmath2 bosons is ineffective at reducing this background .",
    "the search for the heavy higgs boson or for physics beyond the standard model such as new states should take this background into consideration .",
    "the large size of the @xmath44 background casts doubt on the viability of the process @xmath0 as a `` quantum counter , '' since any signal is probably buried beneath the standard model @xmath1 boson loop contribution .",
    "the benefits of polarized photon beams and cuts on the decay products of the @xmath2 bosons in detecting a heavy higgs including the continuum background considered here is a subject for future study .",
