    "one of the most interesting results in quantum information theory has been the discovery that the amount of nonlocality contained in a bipartite quantum system can be quantified by a single number , the entropy of entanglement ( eoe ) .",
    "asymptotically , multiple copies of any two states can be converted into each other and thus into singlets provided that the total eoe is conserved  @xcite . on the other hand , entanglement is the key resource for some of the most interesting tasks in quantum information , as teleportation  @xcite and dense coding  @xcite .",
    "entanglement has its origin in the restriction to those transformations which can be implemented by local operations and classical communication ( locc )  @xcite . in the same way",
    ", any additional restriction should lead to another nonlocal quantity and thus to new effects and applications .",
    "it has been noted by popescu  @xcite that in many physical systems of interest such a restriction is given by a superselection rule ( ssr ) . in this work",
    ", we will consider particle number conservation as a superselection rule ; this is motivated , e.g. , by recent quantum optical experiments on cold atomic gases .",
    "indeed , the notion of entanglement is affected by the additional restrictions  @xcite , and new protocols arise , e.g. , perfect data hiding  @xcite becomes possible  @xcite . on the other hand , it has been shown  @xcite that the extra resource of a shared reference frame ( i.e. , a nonlocal state ) allows to overcome the restrictions imposed by the ssr ( note that  @xcite also adressed non - abelian ssr ) ; conversely , private reference frames restrict the possible operations of an eavesdropper and can thus be employed for cryptographic tasks  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the nonlocality contained in a bipartite state subject to ssr can be quantified by only one additional number , the _ superselection induced variance _ ( siv ) : any two states can be interconverted asymptotically as long as the total eoe _ and _ siv are conserved . in this paper",
    ", we prove this result in greater detail and extend it to mixed states .",
    "we start by discussing how the majorization criterion  @xcite which governs the conversion of quantum states has to be changed when ssr are present , and show that it asymptotically converges to the conservation of eoe ( as it is the case without ssr ) and siv .",
    "we give a detailed proof of this result for arbitrary states and show that it motivates the definition of two different types of standard forms for siv which carry a linear resp.logarithmic amount of eoe .",
    "while there exist pure states which carry only eoe , there are no pure states which contain solely siv . on the other hand , it has been demonstrated  @xcite that there exist separable but nonlocal mixed states , i.e. , states which have a separable decomposition and thus do not contain eoe , but are still nonlocal as all these decompositions violate the ssr and therefore should contain siv . in order to make these statements quantitative , we extend the concepts of eoe and siv to mixed states subject to ssr .",
    "one natural way to do this is to consider the amount of pure states resources needed to create the state  @xcite ; we show that this extension can be done in a meaningful way and that there indeed exist states which contain siv but no eoe .",
    "the converse way is to ask whether it is possible to distill pure state resources from some mixed state  @xcite ; we provide ways to distill both eoe and siv , and we show that it is even possible to distill the siv contained in separable states .    eoe is a _",
    "resource_it allows to overcome the locc restrictions by teleportation .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that any restriction leads to a nonlocal quantity which in turn allows to overcome this restriction .",
    "indeed , we give evidence that siv can be used as a resource which allows to overcome the additional restrictions imposed by the ssr in a bipartite setting ( cf .",
    "therefore , we will use two tasks : distinguishing locally undistinguishable quantum states and teleporting states with nonconstant local particle number  @xcite .",
    "we will show that not only pure states can be used as share reference frames for these tasks , but that there even exist separable states which together with one ebit of entanglement allow to perfectly teleport one qubit and thus to overcome all restrictions .",
    "still , we find that there is a fundamental difference between eoe and siv as a resource , as a finite amount of nonlocality does not allow to perfectly overcome the restrictions which is due to the structure of the underlying hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section : definitions ] , we introduce the concept of a superselection rule and show how it restricts the operations which can be implemented in a bipartite setting . in sec .",
    "[ section : pure ] , we consider the conversion of pure states .",
    "we start with the conversion of single copies , which motivates the definition of siv as a nonlocal monotone ; then , we prove that asymptotically all states can be converted given that both siv and eoe are conserved .",
    "[ section : mixed ] is devoted to mixed state nonlocality .",
    "first , we discuss formation of mixed states ; beyond other results , we provide explicit formulas for the case of qubits .",
    "second , we give different methods for the distillation of both eoe and siv independently as well as simultaneously . finally , sec .",
    "[ section : resource ] discusses siv as a resource ; there , we quantify how well states with siv can be used as shared reference frames which allow to overcome the new restrictions , and we demonstrate that one ebit of entanglement is still sufficient for teleportation .",
    "in this paper , we focus on particle number conservation as a ssr , but the results also apply to charge and other discrete quantities . in this case",
    ", the hilbert space of the system @xmath0 can be decomposed into a direct sum @xmath1 of the eigenspaces of the particle number operator @xmath2 , and the ssr imposes that for any operator @xmath3 , @xmath4=0 $ ] must hold ; thus , any operator can be written as a sum of operators @xmath5 which have support on @xmath6 only , @xmath7 , and thus @xmath8 where @xmath9 projects onto @xmath6 . as the same restriction holds for the admissible density operators ,",
    "all states can be converted into each other , and no interesting new effects can be found .    therefore , we consider ssr in a bipartite setting",
    ". then , we have local particle number operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the total particle number operator is given by @xmath12 while the admissible states have to commute with the global particle number operator @xmath13 , the local operations have to commute with the local particle number operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this restriction is stronger than the one given by the bipartite setting alone and should therefore lead to a new nonlocal resource .",
    "more precisely , the operations on subspaces with fixed total particle number @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 ( and vice versa)in addition to the restriction to products @xmath16 imposed by the bipartite setting , a direct sum structure arises from the ssr .",
    "this product vs.  sum structure will reappear throughout the paper and is the reason for some fundamental differences between eoe ( arising for the product structure ) and siv ( arising from the direct sum ) .",
    "the restriction to block - diagonal operations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : oispnopn ] ) , can be relaxed by adding ancilla modes with @xmath17 particles , performing a block - diagonal unitary @xmath18 , and measuring resp .",
    "tracing out the ancillas .",
    "then , the admissible ( povm / kraus ) operators are given by @xmath19 ; by applying  ( [ eq : oispnopn ] ) to @xmath18 , this leads to @xmath20 ( resp.@xmath21=\\delta{\\mathcal}o$ ] , @xmath22 might differ for each @xmath3 ) : @xmath3 can shift the particle number by some @xmath22 .",
    "( note that @xmath23 remains block - diagonal ) . as most results of this paper are only affected marginally by including ancillas",
    ", we will usually neglect them and just briefly comment on their effect as appropriate .    at the end of this section ,",
    "let us introduce a few notational conventions .",
    "logarithms are taken to the basis @xmath24 .",
    "a ket @xmath25 denotes a state with @xmath26 particles .",
    "we will use this notation even if the underlying eigenspace is degenerate , unless the nonlocal properties under consideration depend on this degeneracy .",
    "the restrictions imposed by the ssr on the allowed operations can be easily overcome by defining a new computational basis @xmath27 , @xmath28 in which all states have the same particle number  @xcite .",
    "this motivates the definition of _ two different _ types of maximally entangled two - qubit states , @xmath29 ( a `` variance - epr '' , as there is some variance in the local particle number ) , and @xmath30 ( an `` entanglement - epr '' , which is defined within an unrestricted subspace and only carries entanglement ) . the very difference between these two states will be a central issue of the paper .",
    "in this section , we characterize pure states in a bipartite setting , i.e. , we determine the possible conversions by locc and thus quantify the nonlocality contained in a bipartite state . without superselection rules ,",
    "the majorization criterion determines whether the conversion between two bipartite pure states is possible  @xcite .",
    "the conversion of multiple copies is governed by a much simpler criterion : it has been shown  @xcite that multiple copies of any two states can be interconverted reversibly .",
    "the conversion ratio is determined by only one quantity which fully characterizes the nonlocal properties of a bipartite state , the _ entropy of entanglement _ ( eoe ) .    as we have seen in the preceding section , in addition to the tensor product structure induced by the bipartite setting the operators have to obey a direct sum structure . in this section ,",
    "we show that these two structures lead to two complementary resources : while the tensor product again induces the majorization criterion and ( asymptotically ) eoe as a nonlocal resource , the direct sum gives rise to additional restrictions on the conversions of states and in turn leads to an own nonlocal resource .",
    "let us consider the following problem : given pure bipartite states @xmath31 and @xmath32 , is it possible to convert @xmath31 to @xmath32 by locc ?",
    "this task can be generalized naturally to a set of outcomes @xmath33 , where each outcome @xmath34 is obtained with probability @xmath35 .",
    "let us first see how this can be solved without ssr  @xcite .",
    "therefore , let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the schmidt coefficients of @xmath31 and @xmath34 , respectively , which completely characterize the states up to local unitaries . without loss of generality , the schmidt vectors may be taken decreasing ( @xmath38 ) and of equal dimension ( by appending zeros ) . following  @xcite , an locc strategy for the conversion @xmath39 exists if and only if ( iff )",

    "let us now see what is different when ssr apply : while the povm measurement @xmath56 is compatible with the superselection rule , the local application of not operations is not ; indeed , it is not possible at all to carry out @xmath50 deterministically in the presence of ssr . in order to see this ,",
    "define block - diagonal povm operators @xmath57 on one local system .",
    "then , the completeness relation @xmath58 yields @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , any povm operator is simply a direct sum of povm operators acting within the subspaces with constant local particle number , i.e. , the usual conditions for convertibility have to hold for each subspace separately .",
    "particularly , this implies that for pure states the _ average weight _ of each subspace with constant local particle number _ can not be changed _ by local operations .",
    "the impossibility to change the average weight of a subspace with fixed local particle number can even be proven at a much more fundamental level .",
    "take multiple copies of some state @xmath61 with nonconstant local particle number , and assume there is a way for alice to change her local particle number distribution on average . as the total particle number is constant",
    ", this implies that the average particle number distribution of bob s system is changed the other way round .",
    "therewith , alice can change bob s density matrix remotely which would allow for supraluminal communication and therefore has to be ruled out .",
    "classical communication between alice and bob , on the other hand , will increase bob s knowledge of the _ actual _ particle number distribution , but it can not influence the _ average _ distribution obtained .    in order to formulate this result precisely , note that any bipartite state @xmath62 subject to ssr can be written as @xmath63 with @xmath64 , i.e. , as a direct sum of unnormalized pure states with constant local particle number .",
    "call the ( ordered ) _ unnormalized _ schmidt coefficients of @xmath65 @xmath66 .",

    "if we label the two teleported basis states @xmath410 , @xmath411 , bob and charlie then share the state @xmath412\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] bob now projects onto the subspaces spanned by the pairs of states @xmath413 and @xmath414 and obtains @xmath415 ( where we omitted the subscript @xmath416 ) . by looking at the average fidelity with the original state",
    ", we find that the error vanishes iff @xmath417 since @xmath198 is positive this implies that @xmath418 for most @xmath419 , as one would expect from eq .",
    "( [ eq : after - teleportation ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fid1-teleport ] ) holds for @xmath397 for @xmath396 , and that the @xmath420 subblocks of the density matrix really approximate pure states .",
    "one might expect that @xmath127 copies of @xmath195 could be used just the same way , but the situation is quite different : filtering operations which bring @xmath421 into a form  ( [ eq : generic - refframe ] ) destroy the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix with high probability so that  ( [ eq : fid1-teleport ] ) can not be satisfied ; therefore it is questionable whether multiple copies of @xmath195 can be used as an arbitrarily precise reference frame . on the other hand ,",
    "this is not so much different from the pure state scenario : while multiple copies of a @xmath166 might indeed be used as a perfect reference frame , these states carry an amount of entanglement which grows _ linearly _ with the precision of the reference frame , whereas a single gaussian distributed state with large siv only has _ logarithmic_and thus in some sense vanishing ",
    "entanglement and is therefore much closer to the case of separable reference frames .",
    "let us note that the teleportation scenario can be altered by joining @xmath95 and @xmath251 .",
    "this is no longer teleportation , of course , and can be accomplished by locc without ssr . on the other hand ,",
    "it is still an impossible task if ssr are present and is thus suitable to characterize mixed states as reference frames without the need for additional entanglement .",
    "let us close by showing that the data hiding protocol given in  @xcite resp .",
    "its extension eq .",
    "( [ eq : datahiding ] ) can be used to construct a mixed state scheme to hide quantum data as well . at a first glance",
    ", one might try to encode the two degrees of freedom of a qubit in the phases of the state @xmath422 , but this can not be accomplished by a linear map .",
    "therefore , we encode the qubit @xmath423 in one of the states @xmath424 , @xmath425 with equal probabilities which is then distributed between alice and bob . additionally , alice and bob are provided with a state @xmath426 which encodes the state alice and bob actually share .",
    "thus , alice and bob share a state which they can not distinguish from the totally mixed state by locc ( theorem  [ theorem : indist ] ) , but they can perfectly recover the original qubit if they join . this scheme can be extended to hide @xmath26-level quantum states using one of the states @xmath427 together with the state encoding @xmath347 , @xmath428 particles are needed , and the associated hilbert space dimension is @xmath334 .",
    "adding restrictions to the operations permissible on a quantum system gives rise to a new resource which in turn allows to overcome this restriction .",
    "the restriction to locc , for example , leads to eoe as a nonlocal resource .",
    "adding ssr to a bipartite system leads to an additional resource , the superselection induced variance siv .",
    "we could show that siv and eoe together completely characterize bipartite states in the asymptotic limit .",
    "thereby , two different kind of standard forms arise , namely singlets and gaussian distributed states with logarithmic eoe .    the search for states",
    "which only carry siv led us to mixed states , where we considered entanglement and variance of formation .",
    "we could show that the concept of entanglement does not have to be changed and thus there exist states which carry siv but no eoe , and we provided explicit formulas for the case of qubits . as to distillation , we could show that both eoe and siv can be distilled , and we provided various ways to do that .",
    "thereby , we found that there exist mixed standard states for siv which do not carry eoe .",
    "while it is possible to extend recurrence protocols such that they work with ssr by using a third copy as a reference frame , it is unlikely that protocols with asymptotic yield work .",
    "finally , we showed that siv is a resource which allows to overcome the restrictions imposed by the ssr , but we also saw that there are fundamental differences to eoe as the size of the reference frame has to grow superlinearly with the problem size , which is due to direct sum structure of the underlying hilbert space .",

    "furthermore , note that @xmath430 .",
    "toghether , this gives the estimate                                      if one includes ancillas , the theorem only holds up to shifts in the local particle number performed on the output states , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : maj - theorem - rhs ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath436 @xmath437 .",
    "formally , up to local unitaries each state is then described by an _ equivalence class _ of ssr - ordered schmidt vectors which are equal up to a shift in the particle number , and there have to exist vectors in these equivalence classes which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : maj - theorem - rhs ] ) .",
    "the proof transfers directly if one replaces @xmath438 by @xmath439 .",
    "e.g , for class of @xmath420 qubit states given by @xmath440 with @xmath441 , @xmath442 , and @xmath443 , @xmath200 is not superadditive with respect to the two subsystems , since @xmath444 and @xmath445)=4p(1-p)$ ] .",
    "some special cases for @xmath198 have to be considered separately .",

    "versa , the situation gets more complicated . in order to distill @xmath198 ,",
