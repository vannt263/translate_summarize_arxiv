    "ordered arrays of single - domain magnetic nanoparticles ( nps ) produced by synthetic methods and self - assembly have attracted a lot of research effort over the last decade @xcite , motivated mainly by the wide range of potential technological applications that vary from high - density magnetic storage media @xcite to high - sensitivity field sensors and logic devices @xcite .",
    "owing to the periodic arrangements of the nps , their single - domain phase and their high monodispersity , they constitute ideal systems to gain basic understanding and possibly control of the role of interparticle magnetostatic interactions in their static and dynamical magnetic behavior .",
    "the issue of interparticle dipolar interactions has been addressed so far by a variety of experimental techniques including in most cases squid magnetometry and ac susceptibility measurements @xcite , small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) @xcite and resonant magnetic x - ray scattering @xcite the last two methods being direct probes of magnetic correlations at the interparticle scale .",
    "these studies have provided ample evidence that the interplay between random anisotropy and dipolar interactions determine the magnetic behavior of the np arrays . in particular observations such as , different values between the in - plane and normal - to - plane remanence magnetization @xcite , distribution of energy barriers with a larger width than the corresponding particle volume distribution @xcite , flat field - cooled magnetization curves @xcite , increase of the blocking temperature with increasing number of monolayers",
    "@xcite have been attributed to interparticle dipolar interactions .",
    "model studies of the field and temperature dependent magnetization @xcite of np arrays demonstrated the role of dipolar interactions and supported most of the experimental observations .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned techniques , the reversible transverse susceptibility technique was theoretically introduced by aharoni",
    "_ et al_.@xcite according to the predictions of aharoni _ et al _ , under conditions of coherent rotation of the magnetization ( stoner - wolfarth model ) the dependence of rts on bias field exhibits three distinct singularities , at the anisotropy fields @xmath3 and at the coercive field @xmath4 , which render the method suitable to probe the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "almost thirty years later the first successful realization of the method @xcite in bafeo powders verified the theoretical predictions .",
    "the rts technique is anticipated to be particularly suitable for analysis of the anisotropy of single - domain magnetic nps , as the magnetization dynamics of those is satisfactorily described by the coherent rotation assumption .",
    "however , there are various factors that make difficult the identification of the rts peak positions and the extraction of the single - particle anisotropy strength .",
    "it has been previously demonstrated that particle size distribution rounds all three peaks@xcite , orientational texture suppresses the coercivity peak @xcite , interparticle interactions cause the coercive anisotropy peaks to merge @xcite , and thermal relaxation of the moments causes large shifts of the coercive peak@xcite . despite of these difficulties ,",
    "the rts technique was further developed and applied successfully to the analysis of the dynamical magnetic behavior of magnetic np assemblies.@xcite these studies have demonstrated the capability of the technique to probe efficiently the transition of the nps from the blocked to the superparamagnetic regime by analyzing the field and temperature dependent rts curves .",

    "the issue of interparticle dipolar interactions and the induced collective magnetization dynamics was also studied in self - assembled arrays ( saa ) of fe @xcite and fe - based @xcite nps .",
    "the authors demonstrated the anisotropy between in - plane and out - of - plane rts and suggested the existence of an intermediate phase between the blocked and superparamagnetic , where dipolar interactions dominate the dynamics of the assembly .",
    "previous theoretical investigations of the rts in dipolar interacting np assemblies have been performed within the mean - field approximation for the local field and a kinetic equation approach to the description of the thermal relaxation of the magnetic moments.@xcite this approach although it predicted correctly the fast decay of coercive peak with temperature it failed to give the expected shift of the anisotropy peak with temperature .",
    "micromagnetic studies of the transverse susceptibility implementing the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equations of motions for dipolar coupled magnetic moments@xcite have also appeared .",
    "the singularities of rts in samples with uniaxial and cubic anisotropy were reproduced and the broadening of the peaks due to dipolar interactions was demonstrated . however thermal relaxation of the moments and orientational randomness of easy axes was not considered in that work and therefore the results can not compare directly to existing experiments on saa of magnetic nps .",
    "thermal fluctuations effects on the transverse susceptibility have also been considered implementing the stochastic llg equations to calculate the imaginary part of rts.@xcite yuan and victora @xcitestudied granular films , where exchange interactions dominate . on the other hand , cimpoesu _ _ et",
    "al__@xcite studied rectangular arrays of dipolar coupled nps with perpendicular anisotropy and identified the effects of dipolar interactions on the signal of the imaginary part of rts . despite the interesting conclusions demonstrated in the work of cimpoesu _ et al _ regarding the interplay of size distribution and dipolar effects , these can not be extended to the case of saa of magnetic nps , which are characterized by random anisotropy and a hexagonal arrangement of the nps .",
    "the aim of the present work is to model the behavior of the field dependent rts of ordered arrays of magnetic nps taking into account both thermal fluctuations and dipolar interaction effects .",
    "this is achieved implementing the metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm . with this algorithm ,",
    "the fluctuations in the the local field are treated exactly ( up to the accuracy imposed by the calculation of the long - range dipolar forces ) and the magnetization correlations , required to describe collective magnetic behavior , are properly developed during the simulation.@xcite finally , the arrangement of the nps on the triangular lattice is a crucial ingredient of the model , because the dipolar interactions have a well established ferromagnetic ( fm ) character in this geometry.@xcite in section ii we describe our model for the np array and the simulation method for the calculation of rts , in section iii we present numerical results for the in - plane and out - of plane rts and finally in section iv we discuss our results and make a connection to related experiments .",

    "reversible transverse susceptibility measurements are performed with an ac measuring field ( @xmath38 ) perpendicular to the dc bias field .",
    "the ac field is weak ( @xmath39 ) and its frequency lies in the rf regime ( @xmath40).@xcite . these experimental conditions allow the following approximations to be adopted in the calculation of the rts .",
    "first , since the amplitude of the measuring field is negligible compared to the saturation field ( @xmath41 ) , the calculation of the susceptibility is performed in the zero - field limit @xmath42 .",
    "second , the frequency dependence of the measuring field is neglected .",
    "this approximation is justified as long as the relaxation time of the nps is large compared to the inverse frequency of the measuring field . assuming that the nps obey the nel - brown model for thermal relaxation , their relaxation time is given by @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 and the blocking temperature @xmath45 . for rts measurements the characteristic measuring time is @xcite @xmath46 , and one obtains @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50",
    "therefore , the static approximation is reasonably justified for temperatures up to @xmath51 above the blocking .",
    "in addition , our focus in the present work is on the static properties and their modification due to dipolar interactions , rather than on frequency dependent quantities , thus working in the static limit serves our purpose . for in - plane measurements",

    "indeed , for an isolated np , the anisotropy peak is centered at the field required for an irreversible switch of the particle s moment .",

    "the fast downshift of the @xmath91 peak relative to the slow shift of the @xmath96 peaks was also found in previous numerical studies of rts and suggests that extraction of the @xmath91 field from rts measurements is much more difficult than of the @xmath96 field , even for monodisperse and extremely dilute samples .",

    "a minor difference between our simulations and measurements on saa of fe nanoparticles,@xcite is that experimentally the transition from a double - peak to a single - peak structure of rts was observed at a temperature @xmath124 and attributed to a transition to a superferromagnetic regime .",
