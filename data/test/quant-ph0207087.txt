    "absorption and emission of monochromatic light in two - level atomic transitions are well - understood processes in quantum optics @xcite",
    ". their properties , however , can change drastically if transitions to a third atomic level have to be included .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in the @xmath1 configuration where two stable states are coupled to a common excited state by laser fields , thus providing two excitation paths which can interfere .",
    "this interference lies at the heart of coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite . here",
    ", destructive interference between the transition amplitudes gives rise to a superposition of atomic states ( dark state ) that is decoupled from coherent radiation but populated by spontaneous emission .",
    "consequently the atom becomes `` trapped '' in this coherent superposition .    for configurations like the @xmath1 scheme , the relative phase of the laser fields does not affect the steady - state dynamics , in the sense that there always exists a reference frame in which the rabi frequencies are real .",
    "this is no longer fulfilled in closed - loop configurations @xcite , i.e. when a set of atomic states is ( quasi- ) resonantly coupled by laser fields , such that each state of the set is connected to any other via two different paths of coherent photon - scattering : in this case , the relative phase @xmath2 between the transitions determines the interference and hence critically influences the dynamics and steady state of the system @xcite .",
    "previous studies of closed - loop configurations often featured double-@xmath1 systems , where two stable or metastable states are -each- coupled to two common excited states @xcite .",
    "these works have shown a rich variety of non - linear optical phenomena .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the phase - dependent dynamics of a closed - loop configuration , consisting of four transitions driven by lasers .",
    "one ground state is coupled in a v - type structure to two intermediate states , which are themselves coupled to a common excited state in a @xmath1-type structure .",
    "we label this system the @xmath0 ( diamond ) scheme .",
    "the steady - state of the @xmath0 scheme , like that of the double-@xmath1 configuration , is a periodic function of the relative phase @xmath2 between the excitation paths , which contribute to the scattering between any initial and final state of the scheme . in particular , the steady state is determined by the concurrence of the phase - dependent hamiltonian dynamics and the relaxation processes .",
    "we will show that , depending on @xmath2 and on the lifetimes of the intermediate states , the @xmath0 system can show a variety of behaviors including population inversion , cpt , and phase - dependent refractive indices .",
    "it is worth noting that the double-@xmath1 and the @xmath0 schemes are governed by the same hamiltonian , but are characterized by different relaxation processes .",
    "this results in critical differences in the dynamics , which we will point out in our discussion .",
    "excitation configurations like the @xmath0 scheme have been investigated in the literature as a model for observing pressure - induced resonances @xcite , and can be found for instance in experiments with gases of alkali - earth atoms which aim at optical frequency standards @xcite or at reaching the quantum degeneracy regime by all - optical means @xcite .",
    "our investigation may contribute to the spectroscopy of these systems and to the development of new and efficient methods of laser - cooling .",

    "the atoms are free , and interact with a multi - chromatic light field . for a sufficiently - dilute gas",
    ", each atom interacts individually with the light , which couples to a set of atomic levels as depicted in fig .  1 .",

    "the transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are optical dipoles with decay rates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "the laser coupling to the transition @xmath15 is characterized by frequency @xmath16 and wave vector @xmath17 , while the strength of the coupling is given by the rabi frequency @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is real and @xmath20 is a constant phase , determined by the phase of the atomic dipole and by the phase of the laser at time @xmath21 and position @xmath22 .",

    "the remaining term describes the atom - laser interaction .",
    "the relaxation processes are assumed to be solely radiative , and the liouvillian @xmath27 in ( [ master:0 ] ) has the form : @xmath32 is the total decay rate from level @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the dipole pattern for the spontaneous emission of a photon on the transition @xmath35 , i.e. the probability of emission at the angle @xmath36 from the @xmath14 axis , such that @xmath37 .",
    "this term describes the diffusion in the dynamics of the atomic motion due to the randomness of the incoherent events . in the limit in which the center - of - mass motion can be treated classically , and for sufficiently short times",
    "this effect can be neglected so that the explicit form of the dipole pattern is irrelevant . on this time scale and for a dilute gas , we can neglect relaxations due to collisions between the atoms .",

    "we remark that the appearance of this behavior requires a `` symmetric '' excitation configuration , meaning that each two - photon excitation path from @xmath4 to @xmath7 has , separately , the same probability . +",
    "a further understanding of the problem can be gained by moving to a suitable basis , following the analysis of @xcite .",
    "this basis is chosen appropriate to the structure of the hamiltonian ( [ h : new ] ) and the relaxation processes in ( [ eq:2 ] ) . for @xmath76 and @xmath84 the dynamics offers simple interpretations for @xmath85 .",

    "the two effects compete , and at saturation a kind of ergodicity is recovered , so that the atomic states are equally populated . on the contrary , for @xmath82 , an eigenspace of the coherent scattering processes exists and is preserved by the action of the incoherent processes . consequently , at any value of @xmath135 and @xmath104 the occupation of the state @xmath33 vanishes .",

    "it is interesting that for these ( small ) values of @xmath104 the system exhibits population inversion on the transitions @xmath114 .",
    "analogously , it can be verified that , fixed @xmath101 and @xmath180 , for @xmath181 the system is trapped in the dark state @xmath182 cpt occurs in this coherence , and this implies population inversion on the transition @xmath183 .",
    "note that the localization in an atomic superposition persists in the neighbourhood of the value of the phase @xmath80 , as it is visible in fig .  3 a ) and c ) .",

    "the analysis of this section is restricted to the choice of parameters @xmath84 , which corresponds here to values of @xmath192 .",
    "this describes the behavior of a gas after doppler cooling , at a thermal energy of @xmath193 , with @xmath194 .",
    "provided that the linewidth @xmath195 is much larger than the recoil energies , @xmath196 , the presented results describe sensibly the atomic response to the drive .    when the medium is doppler broadened , i.e. for @xmath197 ( still keeping the constraint on the recoil energies )",
    ", many features discussed for the case @xmath198 survive and will appear in the signal measured over the ensemble , provided that @xmath199 @xmath200 , so that two - photon transitions are doppler - free .",
    "this situation can be realised for degenerate intermediate - state energies ( @xmath201 ) , resonant drives ( @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) , and laser geometries such that the wave vectors fulfill the relation @xmath204 . in this way",
    "@xmath2 does not depend on time and space ( @xmath66 , @xmath69 ) , and @xmath128 is given by @xmath205 .",
    "also in this regime we find that for @xmath82 the population of @xmath33 vanishes independently of @xmath128 , together with the coherences @xmath206 and @xmath137 .",
    "for @xmath80 and @xmath104 sufficiently different from unity , population inversion can be observed provided the atomic transitions are saturated @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we remark that only part of these considerations can be applicable to `` asymmetric '' configurations , i.e. for values of the rabi frequencies , eigenenergies , decay rates , etc .  , which change the structure of the hamiltonian and relaxation processes , introducing thus either different weights to the interfering excitation paths , and/or additional relative phases , and/or different resonances .",
    "here , the dependence of the steady state on the phase @xmath2 can not often be simply singled out .",
    "the dynamics is a complex combination of all parameters , and exhibits an extremely rich variety of phenomena , which will be subject of future investigations .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of a 4-level system interacting with lasers in a configuration which we have labelled the @xmath0 scheme because of its geometry .",
    "this scheme has a closed - loop excitation structure @xcite , i.e. any transition amplitude between two given states is the sum of two contributions , corresponding to two excitation paths , which may interfere .",
    "the dynamics is determined by a large number of parameters . here",
    ", we have considered that both paths have the same weight , while they differ by a relative phase @xmath2 .",
    "we have discussed the origin of @xmath2 , and investigated the steady state of the interacting system as a function of @xmath2 , in the regime where the steady - state solution exists .    for the chosen parameters , the steady - state solution is phase - sensitive .",
    "this is particularly evident in the coherences , whereas in general the phase dependence of the population is particularly enhanced for certain ranges of values of the relaxation rates . in particular , when the lifetimes of the intermediate states are considerably different from the one of the upper state , the system can exhibit population inversion for some values of the phase around @xmath80 .",
    "we have interpreted and discussed this result in terms of coherent population trapping .",
    "nevertheless , in all regimes here considered the population of the upper state vanishes for @xmath82 .",
    "we have explained these behaviors using a convenient basis , showing that the dynamics is given by the concurrence of the hamiltonian evolution , which is phase - sensitive , with the structure and non - unitarity of the relaxation processes . in particular , for @xmath82 the steady state of the system corresponds to the steady state of a ( closed ) two - level transition .",
    "the phase dependence of the hamiltonian evolution in closed - loop schemes shares many analogies with an atom interferometer @xcite .",
    "the phase dependence survives also at steady state @xcite , and the response of the system could be used as a device for measuring the relative phase between laser fields .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath0 system the phase could be measured through the population of the upper state .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently - weak fields , the functional behavior of this population is well approximated by @xmath207 , and the fluorescence signal from the upper state shows the features of an interference pattern which is sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "this study may be useful in the spectroscopy of alkali - earth atoms , currently investigated in experiments aiming at optical frequency standards @xcite or at bose - einstein condensation by all - optical means @xcite .",
    "further , efficient laser - cooling schemes for these kind of atoms could be developed , by exploiting the phase properties due to the atomic motion in proper laser geometries @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 scheme exemplifies a system where non - linear optics with resonant atoms can be realized . here , the phase is a control parameter capable to change the response of the medium to the drive @xcite",
