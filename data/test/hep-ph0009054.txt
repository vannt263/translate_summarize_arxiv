    "studies of cp - violation in @xmath0 decays must involve final state interaction ( fsi ) effects .",
    "unfortunately , a reliable estimate of such effects is very hard to achieve . in the analyses of @xmath9",
    "decays ( @xmath10 - pseudoscalar meson ) only some intermediate states , believed to provide nonnegligible contributions , are usually taken into account .",
    "many authors restrict their studies to elastic rescatterring @xmath11 only . in regge language",
    "this is described in terms of a pomeron exchange .",
    "although in @xmath12 quasi - elastic rescatterring at @xmath13 contributions from other nonleading regge exchanges are much smaller , they are not completely negligible and have been included in various analyses .    the main problem , however , is posed by the sequence @xmath14 involving _ inelastic _ rescatterring processes @xmath15 .",
    "arguments have been given that it is these inelastic processes that actually constitute the main source of soft fsi phases @xcite .",
    "it has been also pointed out @xcite that nonzero inelasticity strongly affects the extraction of fsi phases in models based on quasi - elastic rescatterring .",
    "thus , inelastic events affect model predictions even if rescatterring is of quasi - elastic type only .",
    "on the other hand , fsi phases are often attributed directly to short - distance ( sd ) quark - line diagrams in the hope that this will take into account all inelastic production phenomena .",
    "this belief persists despite justified scepticism about the dominance of short - distance qcd in fsi of @xmath0 decays ( see eg.@xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it is known that the resulting prescription strongly violates such tenets of strong interactions as isospin symmetry @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the problem pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite is the lack of any correlation between the spectator quark and the products of @xmath16 quark decay . by its very nature",
    "such correlation can not be provided by sd dynamics .",
    "what must be involved here is a long - distance ( ld ) mechanism which ensures that quarks `` know '' about each other .",
    "thus we are led to hadrons , hadron - level dynamics , and inelastic rescatterring effects .",
    "in this paper we perform a simplified analysis of corrections which should be introduced by inelastic rescatterring into the sd - based description of some nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "of course , any such analysis must be half - qualitative in nature , because - in the presence of many decay channels - it is well beyond our ability to take them accurately into account .",
    "since it is believed that @xmath0 decays into @xmath17 and @xmath3 may provide some handle on the determination of angle @xmath18 of the unitarity triangle , we shall concentrate on these decays : it is important to know the effects of fsi here . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , inclusion of coupled - channel quasi - elastic effects ( @xmath19 ) generates an effective long - distance penguin amplitude comparable in size to the short - distance one .",
    "one may expect that inelastic channels will also contribute to this effect .",
    "we start with an sd - based model of nonleptonic @xmath0 decays . on the basis of standard tree - dominated mechanism for these decays , enriched with the related and well - established models of semileptonic @xmath0 decays , we qualitatively estimate the types and the number of states produced in the first stage of the nonleptonic decay . as in other existing models , we take these states as composed of two ( flying apart ) resonances @xmath4 ( section 2 ) . these resonances are assumed to rescatter into @xmath1 through regge exchange .    in order to provide the basis for an estimate of this rescatterring",
    ", we recall how in a regge picture the unitarity relation involving @xmath20 and other @xmath21 processes looks like .",
    "this enables us to make a rough estimate as to what part of all inelastic @xmath22 processes is due to the @xmath20 transitions and , consequently , how much the situation deviates from the case of ( quasi-)elastic rescatterring . using a rough estimate for the contribution @xmath23 from an average single inelastic intermediate channel @xmath24",
    ", we estimate the number of inelastic channels involved ( section 3 ) .    in section 4",
    "we analyse the behaviour of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 amplitudes as a function of the number of intermediate states considered .",
    "we show that although effects due to each single intermediate state are small , the combined effect of all intermediate states is large . in particular , amplitudes of decays into @xmath3",
    "become significantly larger than those estimated through short - distance penguin amplitudes , to the point of being comparable to the @xmath7 amplitudes .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "in short - distance approaches to nonleptonic weak @xmath0 decays , the relevant amplitudes are usually expressed as sums of amplitudes corresponding to different types of quark diagrams ( @xmath27 - tree , @xmath28 - colour - suppressed , @xmath29 - @xmath30-exchange , @xmath10 - penguin , @xmath31 - annihilation , @xmath32 - penguin annihilation ) . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on @xmath33 decays of @xmath34 mesons which are initiated by a @xmath35 transition . in these",

    "these quark - level states should hadronize mainly as @xmath69 states @xcite .",
    "it is the rescatterring from these states to the final pp state that is of interest to us . since we want to estimate rescatterring at hadron level , we need to know what hadronic states are produced in the first stage of the decay .",
    "there are two groups of hadrons produced : one comes from the decay @xmath70 , the other one originates from the recombination of the @xmath71 quark with spectator @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the values of invariant mass squares @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see fig",

    "estimates obtained in various models for semileptonic and nonleptonic decays yield @xmath79 around @xmath80 or so , with the distribution of @xmath81 extending to around 2.0 or 2.5 gev @xcite .",
    "when such a low - mass quark - antiquark state hadronizes , a resonance is produced . in the isgw2 model @xcite for semileptonic decays , exclusive partial widths for the production of lowest - in - mass resonances have been predicted .",
    "the resonances considered were the ground - state mesons ( pseudoscalars @xmath10 : @xmath82 and vector mesons @xmath83 : @xmath84 ) , the p - wave mesons ( tensor mesons @xmath27 : @xmath85 , axial mesons @xmath31 : @xmath86 and @xmath0 : @xmath87 , and scalar mesons @xmath88 : @xmath89 ) , and the @xmath90 and @xmath91 states .",
    "the highest ( nonstrange ) resonance mass explicitly considered in @xcite is below 1.5 gev .",
    "the total partial width for the production of all these resonances is 5 - 6 times larger than the partial width for the production of a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "thus , the average partial width into a resonance is smaller by a factor of 0.7 or so than that for the production of a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the resonances explicitly considered in @xcite do not saturate the inclusive decay rate which is still about two times larger @xcite .",
    "thus , several other resonances of masses below 2.0 or 2.5 gev should be added to the list given above .",
    "assuming that the average contribution from each one is similar to that just estimated , one expects that the number of types of `` average '' resonances produced should be of the order of 15 .",
    "similar or even larger number of resonance types is expected from the hadronization of the @xmath67 created from the @xmath30-boson .",
    "thus , in nonleptonic b decays , apart from the @xmath1 state , many other resonance pairs must be produced : @xmath4 = @xmath92 , ... , @xmath32 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96, ... etc .",
    "exact counting of the number of all these two - resonance states is not important for our purposes .",
    "however , it is fairly easy to give an estimate : limiting oneself to resonances of mass smaller than 2 gev , this number will definitely be greater than 10 , probably of the order of a few tens .    clearly , there is no hope that one can reliably calculate the contribution from rescatterring into @xmath1 from each of these intermediate states .",
    "however , one may try to estimate their overall contribution in an average way . for the first stage of the decay process",
    ", we will assume that the only important amplitude is the tree amplitude @xmath27 and that this amplitude is approximately the same for all intermediate states considered ( for low values of @xmath77 that we shall be concerned with later , this is is indeed the case in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdecay ] ) ) .",
    "although this may seem a very rough assumption for @xmath74 , we shall further see that our general results should be fairly independent of it as long as there is a rather large number of two - resonance states with production amplitudes scatterred around the average .",
    "the next question is how to describe transitions @xmath97 ( or vice versa ) in an average way .",
    "this is what we shall discuss in section 3 .",
    "elastic scatterring and multiparticle production processes are related to each other through unitarity of the s - matrix .",

    "we shall suppress the subscript @xmath100 and its value . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the su(3 ) symmetry case , with the effects of coupled channels included , one should work with states @xmath101 belonging to definite representations @xmath102 of su(3 ) .",

    "of course , the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : totalnumber ] ) is probably too low : contributions from transitions @xmath135 for heavier resonances @xmath131 are likely to be smaller and the total number of states may be larger .",
    "for example , with average value of @xmath106 going down by a factor of 0.6 - 0.7 from 0.08 to 0.05 ( section 2 ) , the above estimate of the number of average quasi - two - body states increases from 25 to over 60 . on the other hand , two - resonance states",
    "need not saturate eq.([eq : numericalunitarity ] ) .",
    "thus , there are two important questions which should be answered :    1 .",
    "how many of states @xmath133 in the unitarity relation of eqs ( [ eq : unitarity],[eq : numericalunitarity ] ) are indeed of the form @xmath4 , so that they can contribute to rescatterring in @xmath0 decays , and 2 .",
    "can the effect of all of these states be described in some average way .    at present , elastic and quasi - elastic contributions from long - distance fsi in @xmath0 decays are usually evaluated using the old language of regge theory .",
    "this language was used in the past also for the description of resonance and multiparticle production processes that are of interest to us . in particular , the question of the build - up of elastic scatterring ( pomeron exchange ) as a shadow of inelastic multiparticle production processes ( and thus the very content of the unitarity relation of eqs ( [ eq : unitarity],[eq : numericalunitarity ] ) ) was discussed extensively .",
    "therefore , we must recall the essential elements of an approach which dealt with that problem .",
    "the approach , predominantly occupied with the issue of the unitarization of dual models ( for reviews see @xcite ) , was based on general properties of dual string models and on phenomenological analysis of resonance and multiparticle production data .    in this approach ,",
    "multiparticle production processes occurring in hadron - hadron collisions at high energies are pictured as proceeding through the production of resonances or clusters in a multiperipheral model ( fig .",
    "2 ) with leading non - pomeron reggeons exchanged in between the clusters .",
    "it is the _ sum _ over _ all types _ and _ numbers _ of resonances produced in this way that saturates the s - matrix unitarity relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) . for @xmath118 above the inelastic threshold but still small enough , one may limit oneself to the production of just one pair of resonances @xmath4 . with increasing energy @xmath118 , the number of resonances produced in a single collision increases on average .",
    "although cross - section for a production of a particular number of resonances goes down at sufficiently high energy , the sum of cross sections over all possible numbers of resonances remains approximately constant .",
    "this constancy of the total inelastic cross section is ensured by a sufficiently fast increase in the number of all possible quark - line diagrams , ie . in the number of all possible states @xmath133 ( and ways in which they are produced ) @xcite .    in our case , at @xmath136 the model @xcite predicts that states composed of just two resonances are produced in the fraction of @xmath137 cases approximately .",
    "further 35% comes from production of three resonances , etc .",
    "although these numbers are obtained in @xcite for resonances of any mass , the main contribution comes from production of resonances of invariant mass squared smaller than @xmath138 .",
    "( contribution from the production of objects of mass @xmath139 is suppressed as @xmath140 for larger @xmath139 @xcite ) .",
    "the average mass of a resonance produced may be estimated in various ways to be around @xmath141 ( @xmath142 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in good agreement with mass @xmath143 or so @xcite , expected for average @xmath81 in the sd - based models of weak decays .",
    "contributions from rescatterring of states with larger values of @xmath77 will be suppressed because production of such states in @xmath1 collisions is not likely .",
    "thus , in a rescatterring process @xmath144 one may expect that the dominant contribution will indeed come from the rescatterring of states composed of two low - mass resonances @xmath24 . translating the above expectation of a 50% share of @xmath4 states in the unitarity relation of eqs ( [ eq : unitarity],[eq : numericalunitarity ] ) into a number @xmath145 of contributing channels which may connect to the state originally produced by the sd dynamics ( ie .",
    "@xmath146 ) , we conclude that this number should be around @xmath147 for average @xmath148 or @xmath149 for average @xmath150 . the latter estimate is probably more realistic since the average size of a contribution from a single @xmath4 channel should diminish with growing resonance masses .",
    "if one accepts that final state interactions can not modify the probability of the original sd weak decay , it follows that vector @xmath151 representing the fsi - corrected amplitudes is related to vector @xmath152 of the original sd amplitudes through @xcite @xmath153 indeed , in the basis of @xmath154-matrix eigenstates @xmath155 the above equation reduces to @xmath156 , ie .",
    "the condition of unchanged probability ( @xmath157 ) admits watson phases only .",
    "the s - matrix may be written in terms of the matrix @xmath158 of amplitudes @xmath106 : @xmath159 we assume that we may treat the fsi - induced corrections to the sd decay amplitudes in a perturbative fashion .",
    "this is in agreement with the ideas of the dominance of sd dynamics .",
    "if this assumption is incorrect , obtaining even half - quantitative predictions will be almost impossible ( cf .",
    "although this assumption may be questioned , it has an important advantage : one may study what happens when the number of contributing two - resonance intermediate states is increased to its expected share ( @xmath160 ) . in agreement with the assumption of a perturbative treatment of rescatterring ( ie . small contribution from @xmath158 ) , we expand the square root in @xmath161 and keep only the first term .",
    "this leads to @xmath162 this is in fact the k - matrix prescription for the estimate of rescatterring effects @xcite . in this prescription ,",
    "final state interactions modify probabilities of the sd amplitudes as can be seen explicitly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmatrix ] ) written in the basis of s - matrix eigenstates .",
    "our calculations will be based on eq.([eq : kmatrix ] ) .    in previous sections we considered a simplified picture of contribution from resonance pairs in which all amplitudes @xmath163 were equal in absolute magnitude while their phases were arbitrary . indeed , when one row of the unitarity condition ( ie .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) ) is discussed , no knowledge of phases is needed . for the purpose of studies of cp - violation the question of phases",
    "is important , however .",
    "therefore , we have to make a very rough estimate of the fsi phases appearing in the strong rescatterring amplitudes @xmath164 in @xmath165 thanks to @xmath166 invariance of strong interactions , the @xmath164 amplitudes are symmetric ( as is the @xmath167-matrix ) . in order to estimate them we have to recall what are the predictions of dual string models for the production of two resonances in high energy @xmath1 collisions . in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the dual string model predicts that the amplitude for the @xmath135 production through an uncrossed diagram of fig .",
    "3a will pick up a rotating regge phase resulting from the expression @xmath168 similarly , for the crossed diagrams of fig .",
    "3b one has to remove the @xmath169 sign in the above expression , ie .",
    "the amplitude is real .",
    "thus , the phase - generating factor differs from the familiar one in @xmath12 scatterring ( ie .",
    "@xmath170 ) only by a different scaling factor ( @xmath171 ) in the denominator .",
    "such a dependence of regge amplitudes on the masses of produced resonances has been confirmed in analyses of experimental data @xcite .    at this point",
    "we have to take into account the fact that regge amplitudes describe scatterring of two colliding resonances @xmath172 and @xmath173 in a state of definite momenta into a similar @xmath1 state .",
    "in particular , the produced @xmath1 state is a superposition of partial waves , while we are interested in the @xmath99 sector of the @xmath88-matrix only .",
    "restriction to the @xmath98 sector is achieved by integrating the rescatterring amplitudes @xmath163 with @xmath174 ( with @xmath175 being the angular momentum of the @xmath1 pair ) over the allowed range of scatterring angle @xmath176 , or over the corresponding range of momentum transfer @xmath177 .",

    "@xcite ) of the order of 5% of the tree amplitude @xmath27 , thus permitting significant interference effects with the short - distance penguin amplitude when the latter is taken from standard sd estimates .",
    "the main results of this work are given in the last two columns of table 1 .",
    "* one can see that the @xmath225 amplitudes , when compared with their estimates taking into account quasi - elastic fsi only , increase in absolute magnitude by a factor between 1 and 2 .",
    "this is due to the additional contribution coming from rescatterring chain @xmath230 .",
    "* an important change can be seen in phase sizes : they are now one order of magnitude larger than in the quasi - elastic case .",
    "the origin of this effect is as follows .",
    "the @xmath30 amplitude is composed of two parts : one ( approximately real ) is the sd amplitude @xmath231 weakly suppressed by elastic ( quasi - elastic ) rescatterring , while the other contains the contribution from the inelastic @xmath232 rescatterring .",
    "the latter part , being proportional to @xmath233 , is mainly imaginary ( for approximately real @xmath106 ) . with a large contribution from inelastic rescatterring",
    ", the resulting phase must therefore be large .",
    "* finally , we see that the @xmath234 amplitude becomes much larger than in the case of quasi - elastic rescatterring only , and is dominantly imaginary .",
    "since the @xmath234 amplitude is fed from no - hidden - strangeness states @xmath235 , one might be tempted to compare this with ref .",
    "namely , it was shown there for the case of a simple two - channel s - matrix that the phase of amplitude in channel 1 is large if the particle originally decays to channel 2 . in our case , although a similar result holds , it is not general - it depends on the value of @xmath118 at which amplitudes @xmath163 are evaluated .",
    "note that inelastic rescatterring renders the @xmath227 amplitude larger than the sd penguin estimate : in fact , it is comparable to the @xmath236 amplitude .    in our approach the full ( fsi - corrected ) amplitudes for @xmath237",
    "decays vanish since : + 1)we have assumed that only the tree amplitude @xmath27 is nonzero , and + 2 ) the rescatterring from the isospin @xmath238 state of @xmath239 , which in principle might feed the final @xmath240 channel , is zero .",
    "state of @xmath4 is antisymmetric ( ie . of the form @xmath241 ) , while the rescatterring contribution due to the uncrossed diagram of fig .",
    "3a is zero when evaluated in between the antisymmetric state @xmath242 and the symmetric state @xmath243 ( for the definitions of states , see eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . rescatterring through diagram of fig .",
    "3b can not change the type of quarks and , consequently , can not induce a transition from the no - hidden - strangeness state @xmath244 into @xmath245 . ]",
    "+ the dependence of the ld rescatterring - induced effective penguin on the isospin channel - with vanishing ( large ) effects in i=1 ( 0 ) channel - should be compared with the sd mechanism which assigns the same size and phase to penguin amplitude @xmath10 in both the @xmath246 and @xmath240 decay channels . this is a general feature of long - distance dynamics : the size and phase of a quark - level diagram depend on what isospin ( su(3 ) ) amplitude it contributes to @xcite .",
    "although the above expectation of fsi effect larger than that naively expected is fairly general , we have to analyse in some detail our assumption of replacing the @xmath171-dependent phase of @xmath200 with an average ( and vanishing ) phase .",
    "such an assumption would be well justified if a large fraction of @xmath24 states led to phases close to the average . since for a given value of the product @xmath194 the phase is fixed , we need to know the density of two - resonance states as a function of @xmath247 .",
    "regge models @xcite predict that the dependence of @xmath248 on @xmath249 is proportional to @xmath250 for larger values of @xmath251 .",
    "this fall of distribution for larger mass values should be clearly visible already at the beginning of the region where using regge description becomes sensible , ie . at @xmath252 or so .",
    "the distribution of @xmath74 in sd models vanishes even faster ( it is fairly negligible above @xmath253 ) .",
    "since we want to estimate corrections to sd models , direct use of mass distributions generated in sd - models might seem to be the simplest and most natural choice .",
    "furthermore , as rescatterring of states with larger values of @xmath77 is suppressed by the small size of the contribution from transitions @xmath254 , one might use the sd distribution of @xmath74 as that of @xmath77 as well .",
    "the problem is , however , that a significant part of the sd distribution of @xmath74 ( or @xmath77 ) corresponds to @xmath255 . on the other hand ,",
    "regge amplitudes assume the form of @xmath256 only for @xmath257 . for @xmath258 , one should replace @xmath259 with @xmath260 .",
    "thus , if regge phases are to be reasonably evaluated we must use an appropriately modified distribution of @xmath74 .",
    "we model this situation in the simplest possible way : by assuming that the distribution of @xmath261 vanishes below @xmath262 and above @xmath263 , while in between these values it is given by @xmath264 this yields the average value of `` effective '' @xmath139 equal to @xmath265 , which is also the value obtained from the accmm distribution of @xmath81 ( see eg . ref .",
    "@xcite ) if contributions from @xmath266 are replaced with contributions at @xmath267 . using @xmath268 as in eq . ( [ eq : mmdistr ] )",
    ", it is straightforward to evaluate the distribution @xmath269 of @xmath171 .",
    "this distribution ( fig .",
    "5 ) is peaked at @xmath270 , its median being at @xmath271 , and the average @xmath272 at @xmath273 .",
    "the tail above @xmath189 contributes a few percent only .",
    "thus , the assumption of @xmath274 used in our previous discussion appears quite reasonable .    with two - resonance states",
    "@xmath133 spread in @xmath171 according to distribution @xmath269 ( larger values of @xmath275 correspond to states with appropriately larger values of @xmath194 ) , it is simple to analyse the predictions of the model numerically .",
    "we are interested in the question how the fsi effects change when heavier and heavier intermediate states @xmath133 are included .",
    "for decays into states in definite representations of su(3 ) , the amplitudes of interest to us are therefore : @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the number of intermediate inelastic states considered ( @xmath278 ) and @xmath279 are given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltas ] ) .    in fig .",
    "6 we present predictions of the @xmath277-dependent version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inverse ] ) for the absolute values and phases of the amplitudes of @xmath0 decays into @xmath280 and @xmath246 states .",
    "these predictions are given as a function of the number @xmath277 of intermediate states considered .",
    "we show the case with @xmath281 ( for @xmath282 one obtains very similar plots with features discussed below being even more pronounced ) .",
    "the point most to the right in each plot ( ie . at @xmath283 ) corresponds to a large value of @xmath171 , where regge approximation breaks down .",
    "consequently , this point should be discarded .",
    "one can see that for @xmath284 the size of the amplitude does not depend very strongly on @xmath277 and is close to the value of the input fsi - free amplitude @xmath285 , which is @xmath286 .",
    "furthermore , the fsi - induced phase is still relatively small ( of the order of @xmath287 ) .",
    "this can not be said of the @xmath227 process . here , the absolute value of the amplitude grows fast with the increasing number of intermediate states .",
    "in addition , already at @xmath288 or so , the phase becomes close to @xmath289 , not far from the previous result of @xmath290 ( table 1 ) obtained for constant phases .",
    "one can also see that when the number of intermediate states approaches its maximum allowed value , the size of the @xmath227 amplitude becomes significant when compared to the tree @xmath284 amplitude . as the number of intermediate states increases , the long - distance - induced penguin amplitude starts to dominate over the sd one ( which was estimated at 0.04 to 0.20 of the tree amplitude , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , assuming applicability of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qdbdecays ] ) , one estimates from fig . 6 that at large @xmath277 the effective long - distance penguin amplitude @xmath228 is around @xmath291 .",
    "this should be compared with the input or effective @xmath27 amplitudes which are around @xmath292 .",
    "thus , the long - distance effective penguin amplitudes become really large .",
    "large rescatterring effects obtained above stem from an _ approximately coherent superposition of contributions from several intermediate channels_. one might argue that in the calculation of this paper sizes of individual rescatterring amplitudes @xmath106 ( ie .",
    "contributions from individual intermediate channels ) are overestimated .",
    "however , the trend of the results expected for the case of smaller amplitudes @xmath106 may be seen from table 1 and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : constphaseapprox],[eq : constphaseapprox1 ] ) .",
    "the column of @xmath282 corresponds to a smaller value of average amplitude @xmath293 .",
    "the connection existing between the values of @xmath145 to @xmath294 stems from the assumption that at energy @xmath13 a two - resonance state is produced in approximately half of all inelastic @xmath1 collisions .",
    "as long as this fraction ( @xmath214 ) is kept constant and the perturbative treatment of fsi is valid , smaller values of amplitudes @xmath106 - after summing over all intermediate channels - result in rescatterring corrections to weak decays larger than naively expected .",
    "one may also try to estimate roughly the rescatterring contribution in a direct way ( ie . without using the value of @xmath214 ) by just adding rescatterring contributions with amplitudes @xmath217 assumed to be of the order of @xmath295 or so ( in agreement with experiment ) .",
    "then , for the number of average intermediate states taken as equal to the number of final states in standard models of sd decays , ie . of the order of @xmath296 or more , one is bound to obtain a large rescatterring effect .",
    "please note that our whole approach starts with the generally accepted features of the sd decay ( and resonance production ) mechanism and assumes that subsequent fsi may be treated perturbatively .",
    "we have shown that even in this case the corrections tend to become large .",
    "of course , if they are too large , the whole perturbative scheme of their estimation ( as well as the sd mechanism for the description of @xmath0 decays ) ceases to be viable .",
    "we have discussed multichannel inelastic rescatterring effects in @xmath0 decays into @xmath17 and @xmath297 .",
    "generally accepted features of short - distance decay mechanism have been assumed as part of our input .",
    "these assumptions included estimates of the types and number of resonances produced in two - resonance states initiated by the @xmath298 transition .",
    "rescatterring of these two - resonance states into the final state consisting of one pair @xmath1 of pseudoscalar mesons was evaluated under the assumption that such fsi may be treated perturbatively .",
    "the basis for this evaluation was provided by existing knowledge about how the inelastic multiparticle ( resonance ) production in @xmath1 collisions is correlated with elastic @xmath1 ( pomeron exchange ) scatterring .",
    "this knowledge permitted us to estimate that at @xmath13 @xmath1 scatter into a two - resonance @xmath4 state in approximately 50% of cases .",
    "thus , the total size of rescatterring from @xmath4 to @xmath1 was fixed .    using the regge model for the description of the @xmath97 processes",
    ", we have shown that the rescatterring contributions from the individual intermediate channels add approximately coherently . as a result , the combined effect of rescatterring through many two - resonance intermediate states was shown to be quite large .",
    "this was demonstrated under the assumption that fsi may be treated perturbatively . if that assumption is overoptimistic , reliable estimate of ( presumably even larger ) fsi effects will almost certainly be much more difficult .    in our calculations",
    "the amplitude for the decays @xmath234 was induced by ld rescatterring from no - hidden - strangeness isospin 0 states produced via short - distance tree diagram .",
    "this fsi - induced amplitude was shown to be larger than its short - distance penguin counterpart .",
    "the phase of the ld amplitude was estimated to be around @xmath289 .",
