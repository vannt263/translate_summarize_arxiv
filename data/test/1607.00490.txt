    "it is known that network coding affords throughput gain over routing in such networks ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and given a network and the demanded source messages at each sink , the network coding problem is to design a network code that maximizes the rate of information transfer from the source nodes to the sinks .",
    "but in some networks , like a sensor networks for environmental monitoring , nodes may be interested not in the messages generated by some other nodes but in one or more functions of these messages . designing a network code that maximizes the frequency of target functions computation , called the _ computing capacity _ , per network use at the sinks",
