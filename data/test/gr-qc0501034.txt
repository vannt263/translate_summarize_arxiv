    "sam is in the office and has just finished reading plato s _ meno _  @xcite in which socrates uses a self - discovery technique to teach a boy pythagoras theorem .",
    "sam is inspired by this dialog and is pondering its applicability to lecturing undergraduate physics when a tap on the door breaks that chain of thought .",
    "kim enters the room looking bleary eyed and pale .",
    "`` been out celebrating the last lecture of the year '' sam surmises , little knowing that other things have kept kim awake .",
    "* your lectures on special relativity fascinated me , and when i got home i wondered if i could construct a simple experiment to prove or disprove time dilation , the aspect of special relativity that interests me the most .",
    "while lying in bed before dozing off i realised that a clock placed at the equator should run slower than a clock placed at the pole .",
    "so i did a little calculation and found that special relativity predicts that a clock on the equator runs slower by about 100 nanoseconds per day with respect to a clock at the pole . while this effect is not large it is certainly measurable with modern atomic clocks",
    "so i went onto the internet to see if i could find any reference to such an experiment and to my surprise i could nt .",
    "+ i was starting to get so frustrated that i could nt sleep .",
    "i glanced at the clock ( 3 am ) .",
    "i thought to myself `` how accurate is my clock ?",
    "i should check it against internet time . ''",
    "then it occurred to me that the world timing standard organisations must mention a latitude effect on local clock accuracies .",
    "so i got onto the internet again and checked _ _ the bureau international des poids et mesures ( bipm)__@xcite as they calculate the international atomic time ( tai ) .",
    "bipm calculate tai from atomic clocks located in more than 30 countries around the world .",
    "i was sure that i must find something about the latitude effect on their web site .",
    "after spending hours trawling through the site and then other sites on the web , i came up with nothing .",
    "there was a discussion of the relativistic effect of placing clocks at high altitudes , but nothing about latitude . in my despair",
    "i gave up and collapsed into a fitful sleep .",
    "+ i came to see you today in the hope that you could cure my insomnia .",
    "* you are in good company in thinking that clocks at the equator and the pole should tick at different rates .",
    "einstein himself predicted as much in his famous 1905 paper on the special theory of relativity.@xcite luckily for physics the effect was not measurable with the instruments of the day as einstein s prediction would have failed to match experiment .",
    "let us return to your findings : 1 .   according to the special theory of relativity",
    "a clock located at the equator should run slower than one at the pole 2 .",
    "all clocks located at sea - level on the earth s surface tick at the same rate , regardless of latitude + to help you understand how both apparently contradictory statements can be true i will ask you a question . +",
    "if the earth was a rotating perfect fluid and we could ignore the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon what shape would it be ?",
    "* well , i do nt see how this is relevant , but i would answer your question by drawing a free - body diagram .",
    "can i use your blackboard ?",
    "+ [ fig : fbd ]   + now let me see  consider a test mass placed on the surface of the earth .",
    "we know that the forces acting on the test mass are the outward pointing force due to the difference in pressure and the inward pointing force due to gravity",
    ". if the test mass is in hydrostatic equilibrium then the pressure force must be perpendicular to the surface and the sum of the gravitational and pressure forces is the centripetal force , which is perpendicular to the axis of rotation.@xcite hmmm  you would have a complicated integral equation to solve because the direction of the gravitational force vector would depend on the distribution of mass , furthermore the pressure gradient would be perpendicular to the surface we are trying to calculate .",
    "it seems to be a complicated problem and , to be honest , i am not sure that i could solve it . *",
    "it is a difficult problem and one whose solutions involve hyperbolic and elliptic functions . chandrasekhar has devoted a whole book to the subject.@xcite before we travel that arduous mathematical road let us see if we can use some physics to help us .",
    "taking our model of earth as a rotating perfect fluid , is the earth an equipotential surface ? * ( _ thinks _",
    " ) yes . * why ? * because if it was nt the sea water would feel a force @xmath0 and would move until @xmath1 everywhere on the surface .",
    "* so if i told you what the earth s gravitational field is could you tell me the shape of the earth ?",
    "* yes , i think i could .",
    "* how ? * if you told me that the earth s gravitational field is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance from the centre and @xmath4 is the colatitude  @xcite then i could calculate the _ effective _ potential felt by an observer co - rotating with the earth by including the centripetal force : @xmath5 \\\\       \\mbox{$\\theta = 0 $ at the north pole , $ \\pi/2 $ at equator and $ \\pi$ at the south pole }       \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the earth s rotation rate and @xmath3 is the distance from the centre to the earth s surface .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of  eq . is the so called `` centrifugal potential '' .",
    "now we have already argued that a co - rotating observer on the surface of the earth feels no change in effective potential regardless of their latitude , i.e. , @xmath7 is constant .",
    "furthermore , you have told me that we know what the earth s gravitational field @xmath2 is , so all i need to do is rearrange equation  eq . and",
    "_ voil _ we have an expression for the shape of the earth s surface .",
    "mind you , as @xmath8 may be a complicated function ; i am not sure that i can find an analytic expression for @xmath3 anyway .",
    "+ all this is very interesting , but i do nt see how it answers my question about why clocks tick at the same rate on the earth s surface . *",
    "patience , we are coming to that .",
    "first let us investigate the discovery you have made , namely the shape of the earth .",
    "let me see , i know i have it in here somewhere ",
    "+ _ sam flicks through some notes in the filing cabinet _ + ah here it is . despite the earth",
    "s complicated shape with mountains and valleys its gravitational field can be modelled to a fractional accuracy of @xmath9 by:@xcite @xmath10 where * * @xmath11m@xmath12s@xmath13 is the product of the gravitational constant and the mass of the earth  @xcite * * @xmath14 is a measure of the earth s equatorial bulge and is related to the legendre polynomials  @xcite * * @xmath15 m is the earth s equatorial radius  @xcite + to evaluate your equation for the earth s surface ( which incidentally is called the geoid ) you will need an accurate value of the earth s rotation rate .",
    "+ _ sam shuffles through some files _  + yes here it is  @xcite @xmath16 + now your geoid equation is going to be a bit tricky to solve analytically so instead of doing that let us see if we are on the right track .",
    "the easiest thing for us to do is to check that your equation for the earth s effective potential @xmath7 is the same at the equator and the pole .",
    "* * : the earth s mean polar radius is @xmath17 km  @xcite @xmath18 * * : the earth s mean equatorial radius is @xmath19 km  @xcite @xmath20 + look the two values for @xmath7 are the same ! + what have you shown ? *",
    "we have shown that the earth is indeed an equipotential surface with respect to an observer sitting on the surface .",
    "but sam , this has nothing to do with the question i originally asked you !",
    "* does nt it ?",
    "what did you ask me again ? *",
    "i asked you why all clocks tick at the same rate on the surface of the earth when special relativity predicts that they should run slower at the equator than at the pole .",
    "* kim do you remember how we derived einstein s famous formula @xmath21 ? * yes , and to be honest i was a little disappointed with it .",
    "once we learnt that a constant speed of light lead to the lorentz transformations , the rest was just algebra .",
    "* remind me of the algebra . *",
    "we got to the point that we realised that the proper time interval , @xmath22 must be defined as @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the coordinate time and space interval respectively .",
    "then we simply multiplied equation  eq .",
    "by @xmath26 to get @xmath27 so if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 , like i said , just algebra .",
    "* hmm , yes indeed",
    ". suppose you are floating in a room with no windows or doors .",
    "all of a sudden , you feel a force that throws you against the wall .",
    "if their were two possible forces , gravitational or centrifugal , are you able to determine which force you are feeling ?",
    "* i do nt see how .",
    "* and what would you ( sitting in this closed room ) say your time dilation was with respect to an observer who was not feeling the centrifugal or gravitation force ?",
    "* i think i see what you are getting at .",
    "i ca nt say whether the force is gravitational or centrifugal , so i must treat their effects as the same .",
    "if i knew the force was centrifugal , i would say that my time dilation with respect to a stationary observer depends only on my velocity @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "as i do nt know where the energy to thrust me against the wall has come from , to be consistent , i must say that the time dilation depends only on the effective potential , which is the sum of the gravitational and centripetal potentials . * excellent !",
    "the idea that you ca nt know if the force is a uniform gravitational force , or a combination of uniform forces , is called the _ equivalence principle_.  @xcite what does it tell you about clocks on the surface of the earth ? * yes , yes , of course . according to somebody standing anywhere on the surface of the earth , all their energy is effective potential energy @xmath7 .",
    "the rate at which their clock ticks depends only on this effective potential .",
    "we already showed that the effective potential over the surface of the earth is constant .",
    "so all clocks on the surface of the earth tick at the same rate .",
    "eureka , i can sleep again ! * yes , you can sleep well indeed because you have just discovered one of the fundamental arguments that led to the development of the general theory of relativity .",
    "before you go , let me clarify one point .",
    "to determine the time dilation , you used the effective potential which came from newtonian arguments about gravitational and centrifugal forces . according to general relativity the newtonian effective potential is an approximation to the relativistic effective potential .",
    "this does not change your conclusion in any way , the effective potential is still constant , it just means that in general relativity we have a slightly different version of @xmath7 ( _ see appendix  [ app : clockgr ] _ ) .",
    "having said that , you should note that for the earth , the newtonian and relativistic effective potentials are almost identical . to learn precisely what the difference is",
    ", you will have to take my general relativity course , unless you continue to derive general relativity by yourself !    _ after exchanging pleasantries , kim leaves for the long cycle home .",
    "kim reflects that the thought experiment involving a person in a windowless room who did nt know if the force they felt was gravitational or centrifugal was very similar to the arguments about absolute and relative motion that they learnt in their special relativity course . _",
    "_ sam contemplates this conversation with kim and wonders if it should be entered into next year s general relativity lecture notes . _",
    "the author would like to thank two anonymous referees who provided insightful comments which improved the clarity of arguments presented in this paper .",
    "the author would also like to thank vivienne wheaton for proof reading the final version .",
