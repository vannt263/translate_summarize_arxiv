    "the recurring transient x - ray pulsar v0332 + 53 was discovered in 1983 in _ tenma _ observations made from 1983 november to 1984 january @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an outburst was revealed in _",
    "vela 5b _ data to have occurred in 1973 summer @xcite . in rapid follow - up observations to the _ tenma _ detection by _ exosat _ during the 1983 outburst , 4.4s pulsations were discovered , an accurate position was determined , and indications were found for an orbital period of 34.25days @xcite .",
    "the position and subsequent optical / x - ray variability secured the identification of the counterpart with the heavily reddened b star bq  cam @xcite .",
    "later investigations refined the spectral type to o89 @xcite .",
    "analysis of the _ tenma _ data revealed a shape similar to that seen in other accreting x - ray pulsars with a flat power law and exponential cutoff , and also showed evidence of a cyclotron line at @xmath228kev @xcite . in 1989",
    "september the source experienced another outburst , this time observed by _ ginga _ @xcite . with the energy range of the large area counters",
    "adjusted to cover the 260kev range , cyclotron resonant scattering features ( crsf ) were detected at 28.5 and 53kev @xcite . at the time , this was the fourth accreting x - ray pulsar system to exhibit cyclotron features . since then",
    "a significant number of this class of objects have been shown to have crsfs , with 4u  0115@xmath063 setting the record for the number of harmonics at five ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "v0332 + 53 went into outburst again in 2004 november , reaching a 1.512kev intensity of @xmath21crab @xcite .",
    "a long series of observations by the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ? * ) and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ? * ) aboard _ rxte _ were made throughout the outburst .",
    "following up on our initial announcement @xcite , here we report the discovery of a third cyclotron line at @xmath274kev , along with clear evidence for a non - gaussian shape of the fundamental . in  2 we present the observations and the data extraction .",
    "the phase - averaged and the phase - resolved spectra are analyzed and discussed in  3 and  4 , respectively . in ",
    "5 we summarize the results and present our conclusions .",
    "since the luminosity of the source is strongly variable during the outburst , we decided to concentrate on the three longest observations during the peak of the outburst as observed in the soft x - ray band by the _",
    "rxte_-all sky monitor ( asm ; fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) .",
    "results from the full monitoring data set will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we combined the pca and hexte data taken 2004 december 2426 ( _ rxte _ obsids 90089 - 11 - 05 - 08 g , 90089 - 22 - 01 - 00 g , and 90089 - 22 - 01 - 01 g ) , giving a total of @xmath258ks of exposure in the pca and 14.4ks of dead - time - corrected live time in hexte cluster b. at the time of the selected observations , hexte s cluster a was not rocking due to a single event upset , and we discarded data from this cluster . the data were reduced with heasoft version 5.3.1 , and spectral modeling was performed with xspec version 11.3.1w @xcite . for modeling the phase - averaged spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycl]a ) , pca data from 320kev and hexte data from 18150kev were used , and the hexte data were rebinned by factors of 3 and 5 between 70100 and 100150kev , respectively .",
    "a systematic error of 0.5% was assumed for the pca .",
    "the x - ray spectrum observed from accreting x - ray pulsars is the superposition of x - rays originating in the accretion column and the hot spots on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the neutron star s x - rays are partially intercepted by the material present in the system , such as the stellar wind , giving rise to significant absorption which can exceed @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of the formation of the x - ray continuum in the accretion column ) .    the @xmath4 magnetic field close to the magnetic poles of the neutron star leads to the formation of crsfs in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the observer s frame energy of the crsfs is given by @xcite    @xmath5    where @xmath6,2 ,  , is the harmonic number , @xmath7 is the fundamental nonrelativistic cyclotron energy ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath8 is the angle between the wave vector of the incoming photon and the magnetic field @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the gravitational redshift ( assuming a @xmath11 neutron star with a 10 km radius ) .",
    "the great importance of crsf observations is that they provide the only direct way to measure neutron star @xmath9-field strengths .",
    "the lack of adequate theoretical continuum models for accreting neutron stars necessitates the use of empirical models to describe the observations @xcite .",
    "we use a power law modified at higher energies by a `` ferm- dirac cutoff '' @xcite to fit the pca and hexte data simultaneously , including a multiplicative constant as a fitting parameter to allow for the slight difference ( @xmath125% ) in the flux calibration of both instruments .",
    "photoelectric absorption and a strong fe k@xmath13 fluorescence line at 6.35kev from neutral iron , with a width of @xmath14kev and an equivalent width of 123ev are also taken into account .",
    "the soft continuum parameters found ( see below ) are in general agreement with earlier results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while this model fits the overall shape of the continuum reasonably well , strong absorption - like features are present above 20kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycl]b ) , which we model as lines with gaussian optical depth profiles of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the line energy , @xmath17 is the line width , and @xmath18 is the optical depth at the line center . the spectral shape is then given by multiplying the continuum spectrum by @xmath19 ( * ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we start by modeling the strongest feature between 20 and 30kev with one of these gaussian components ( see table  1 for the relevant best fit parameters ) .",
    "this feature corresponds to the crsf first reported by @xcite . while the 2030kev residuals improve significantly compared to the pure continuum fit when this component is included , another strong and remarkably well defined absorption - like feature emerges at @xmath250kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycl]c ) .",
    "this feature is the first harmonic of the cyclotron line , found at @xmath20 times the energy of the fundamental and already tentatively reported by @xcite .",
    "taking these two lines into account , weaker residuals remain at @xmath225kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycl]d ) . similar to 4u0115",
    "+ 63 @xcite and other sources , these residuals are caused by the fundamental crsf having a non - trivial shape , which can not be modeled well with any simple line shape ( see  [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "to describe the complex shape we add a shallow ( @xmath21 ) and narrow ( @xmath22kev ) line component at an energy similar to that of the fundamental , @xmath23kev ; the shape of this more complex line profile is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cycl]a .",
    "although lowering the @xmath24 considerably , the fit is still not acceptable , and significant residuals remain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycl]e ) .",
    "adding another line at @xmath25kev improves the fit significantly to @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycl]f , the unfolded spectrum and the consecutive effect of the individual crsfs are shown in fig .  [ fig : cycl]a ) . the @xmath27-test probability that this improvement is due to chance is only @xmath28 ( however , see @xcite concerning the applicability of the @xmath27-test in this case ) .",

    "the negative positive exponential continuum ( npex , * ? ? ? * ) , for example , also requires the presence of three crsfs at 27 , 51.7 , and 74.8kev , again with a non - gaussian fundamental .",
    "other continua gave similar results , as do other prescriptions for the shape of the crsf .",
    "the actual choice of the continuum or line shape is thus irrelevant for the detection and characterization of the crsfs at the level of the _ rxte _ energy resolution .",
    "we therefore report the discovery of the second harmonic of the cyclotron line in v0332 + 53 with _ rxte _ , confirming our preliminary initial report for this data set @xcite .",
    "this discovery has been independently confirmed by subsequent _ integral _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "the neutron star s magnetic axis is offset from its spin axis , not only giving rise to x - ray pulsations but also confronting the observer with a complex situation . due to the rotation of the neutron star ,",
    "the accretion column and the hot spots are seen under a constantly changing viewing angle .",
    "since the physical conditions are likely to be variable within the emission region and since the crsf line shape depends on the viewing angle , we expect the x - ray continuum and line parameters to depend on the pulse phase @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by pulse - phase - resolved spectroscopy in a number of sources , such as gx  301@xmath962 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* finding @xmath220% change in the line energy ) , vela  x-1 @xcite , or 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite .    to obtain phase - resolved spectra",
    ", we determined the pulse period for each of the three observations using standard techniques .",
    "this approach is necessary , as the accumulated uncertainty of the only available orbital ephemeris of the neutron star @xcite is too large to allow any meaningful orbit correction .",
    "the average non - orbit - corrected x - ray period is @xmath97s .",
    "after phase - aligning the resulting pulse profiles , we determined phase - resolved spectra .",
    "[ fig : profile]a shows the resulting hexte and pca pulse profile of v0332 + 53 .",
    "since the data modes of the observation do not contain a pca data mode with energy resolution below 20kev and a sufficiently high time resolution for phase - resolved spectroscopy , we performed phase resolved spectroscopy using the hexte data only .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio considerations allow a maximum of six phase bins ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile]a ) . in the resulting phase - resolved spectra , the source is detected to @xmath2100kev , such that we only model the lower two crsfs and do not include the structure of the fundamental line .",
    "the absence of soft spectral data forces us to hold @xmath35 and @xmath40 at the values found from the appropriate phase - averaged spectrum .",
    "this is justified by the relative constancy of these parameters as seen with earlier instruments @xcite .",
    "both crsfs are detected with high significance in all pulse phases .",
    "[ fig : profile]b  e show the evolution of the crsf line energy and depth over the x - ray pulse .",
    "in contrast to the sources mentioned above , there is little to no variation in these parameters , no other spectral parameters show any significant variation either .",
    "we have presented the discovery of a third cyclotron line in v0332 + 53 , making this x - ray pulsar the second , after 4u0115 + 63 , with more than two cyclotron lines , and confirming the identification of the 26kev line as the fundamental crsf . similar to sources such as 4u0115 + 63 or gx  301@xmath962 , the hexte spectrum shows that the profile of the fundamental line has an asymmetric profile that is shallower toward lower energies .",
    "such a profile is consistent with expectations from the asymmetric shape of the relativistic cross section for resonant electron scattering , but could also be influenced by the emission wings predicted in monte carlo simulations @xcite or by a variation of the @xmath9-field in the emission region .",
    "consistent with the trend seen in most sources with multiple crsfs , the energies of the fundamental and its harmonics do not scale like 1:2:3 , as predicted by the non - relativistic eq .",
    "[ eq : nonrel ] .",
    "rather , the line ratios are slightly smaller , in agreement with the prediction of relativistic quantum mechanics ( eq .  [ eq : cyce ] ) . using all three observed line energies ( taking @xmath98kev for the fundamental line ) and assuming @xmath99 , for v0332@xmath053 a most probable polar magnetic field of @xmath1 g",
    "consistency between all three crsf energies can only be reached for @xmath100 ; i.e. , photons scattered out of the line have an initial direction that is perpendicular to the @xmath9-field , as is expected from the significant increase of the electron scattering cross section with @xmath101 .",
    "this result provides a much stronger confirmation of the interpretation of the line features as crsfs than is possible in sources where just the fundamental is observed .",
    "pulse - phase - resolved spectroscopy revealed that v0332 + 53 shows far less variability in the crsf parameters than many other sources .",
    "the origin of the crsf variability in these sources is unclear , although it has been pointed out that their complex pulse profiles make it likely that different regions of the accretion column or even different magnetic poles are seen during the x - ray pulse .",
    "the remarkably simple hard x - ray pulse profile of v0332 + 53 suggests a less complex accretion geometry than in other sources , which might also explain the very weak crsf variability .    in conclusion ,",
    "our observation of multiple lines strongly confirms the interpretation of these features as cyclotron lines . for a further interpretation of our results , however , more realistic models for the neutron star continuum and especially for the line shape are needed , to include the radiative transfer in the line , multiple photon scattering , etc . , and",
    "thus also predict emission wings and strongly asymmetric profiles .",
    "work is currently ongoing in our collaboration to compute such models for a variety of parameters to make such progress possible in the near future .",
