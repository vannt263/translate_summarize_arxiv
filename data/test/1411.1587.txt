    "optical ring potentials ( orps ) with axial symmetry are considered as basic building blocks and the simplest nontrivial closed - loop circuits in atomtronics @xcite and atom interferometry @xcite .",
    "atoms can be trapped by means of the optical dipolar force in high or low intensity regions with red - detuned @xcite or blue - detuned @xcite light , in what follows called bright and dark potentials , respectively . on the one hand ,",
    "bright orps have been proposed and demonstrated with high - azimuthal - order laguerre ",
    "gaussian ( lg ) beams @xcite and also with annular microlenses @xcite .",
    "azimuthal lattices within orps have been demonstrated with time orbiting of light beams @xcite and by interference of lg beams of different azimuthal orders @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional stack of orps in a line has been proposed in an optical cavity @xcite and demonstrated with axicon beams @xcite .",
    "experimental storage and propagation of ultra - cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in bright orps have been reported recently @xcite .",
    "dark orps on the other hand are optical fields with an annular region of minimum intensity @xcite , such as closed - loop optical singularities @xcite , for which the region of minimum intensity is exactly zero . for ultra - cold atoms , dark orps have the advantage of substantially reducing atom heating and decoherence rates @xcite because of the low rate of spontaneous photon scattering as well as producing intrinsically flat potential minima .",
    "blue - detuned orps have been experimentally reported by means of lg beams generated with spatial light modulators ( slms ) @xcite and by amplitude masks @xcite .",
    "these two techniques might experience the following limitations : ( i ) a significant fraction of the input power is lost and , therefore , it does not contribute to create the optical trap , ( ii ) the smoothness and , therefore , the quality of the trapping potential is limited by the size and number of pixels for the slms and the resolution of the printing system for the amplitude masks , and ( iii ) an accurate control on the position and alignment of the optical elements being used is required . as a consequence ,",
    "these two techniques yield typically not null intensity minima .",
    "producing orps with zero - intensity annular regions both along the radial and axial directions is a challenging task . in this case , the dark potential forms toroidal dark focus , i.e. , a region of minimum intensity confined by higher intensities ( light walls ) both in the axial and radial directions . a toroidal dark focus has only been demonstrated using a superposition of two lg beams @xcite .    in this article , we present a new method to generate a dark orp by means of the phenomenon of conical refraction ( cr ) @xcite , occurring in biaxial crystals .",
    "cr leads to a set of two concentric bright rings enclosing a dark ring of null intensity , known as poggendorff dark ring ( pdr ) .",
    "we theoretically investigate the three - dimensional ( 3d ) field distribution around the cr pdr and show both theoretically and experimentally that it is a toroidal dark focus .",
    "we also discuss the use of the pdr as a blue - detuned orp for ultra - cold atoms and demonstrate this with a @xmath0rb bec .",
    "this technique has the advantage of the easy generation of the toroidal dark trap , which only needs a focused gaussian beam and a biaxial crystal .",
    "in addition , cr provides the full conversion of the input power into the toroidal dark trap , in contrast to the previously reported methods which introduce losses due to diffraction in the generation of lg beams .",
    "these features make the cr toroidal dark - focus beam very attractive for particle @xcite and atom @xcite trapping , in particular with blue - detuned light beams @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ seccr ] we give an introduction to the cr phenomenon , presenting its main fundamental characteristics : section [ secpcr ] presents the exact paraxial solution of the light pattern after propagation along one of the optic axes of a biaxial crystal , while its asymptotic approximation is presented in section [ secacr ] . in section [ secatomscr ] ,",
    "we investigate the use of the toroidal dark trap provided by cr for the trapping of ultra - cold atoms with blue - detuned light .",
    "in section [ harmonic_approach ] we apply the harmonic approximation around the pdr and present expressions for the trapping frequencies and height of the potential barriers as a function of the physical parameters of the trapping system .",
    "then , both numerical simulations and experimental data for a @xmath0rb bec trapped in the pdr are shown in section [ secnum ] .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are summarized in section [ seccon ] .",
    "conical refraction @xcite is observed when a focused light beam passing along an optic axis of a biaxial crystal ( bc ) is transformed into a light ring at the focal plane .",
    "each pair of diagonally opposite points of the cr ring are orthogonally linearly polarized , as shown by double arrows in fig .  [ figcr_cone_ring ] .",
    "therefore , a complete ring with uniform azimuthal intensity distribution is observed only for randomly ( rp ) or circularly ( cp ) polarized input beams ( fig .",
    "[ figcr_cone_ring](a ) ) , while for linearly polarized ( lp ) input beams the intensity pattern is azimuthally crescent with a zero - intensity point , where the polarization is orthogonal to the one of the input beam .",
    "this polarization distribution , which constitutes an essential signature of the cr phenomenon , significantly differs from the usually known radial and azimuthal polarization modes and only depends on the orientation of the plane of the crystal optic axes @xcite .",

    "the cr rings are observed at the focal plane , and more involved structures including secondary rings are found as one moves along the beam propagation direction . at points given by @xmath11 from the focal plane a bright spot known as",

    "we have applied the harmonic approximation around the pdr and we have derived the expression for the radial and axial trapping frequencies and the maxima of the potential barriers for blue - detuned light as a function of common experimental parameters such as beam power , beam waist , detuning and the parameters of the crystal .",

    "other cylindrically symmetric light structures of interest in atomic trapping experiments such as flat intensity regions or doughnut - like beams are also accessible via cr @xcite .",

    "<S> we present a novel approach for the optical manipulation of neutral atoms in annular light structures produced by the phenomenon of conical refraction occurring in biaxial optical crystals . for a beam focused to a plane behind the crystal , </S>",
    "<S> the focal plane exhibits two concentric bright rings enclosing a ring of null intensity called the poggendorff ring . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the poggendorff dark ring of conical refraction is confined in three dimensions by regions of higher intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the positions of the confining intensity maxima and minima and discuss the application of the poggendorff ring for trapping ultra - cold atoms using the repulsive dipole force of blue - detuned light . </S>",
    "<S> we give analytical expressions for the trapping frequencies and potential depths along both the radial and the axial directions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present realistic numerical simulations of the dynamics of a @xmath0rb bose - einstein condensate trapped inside the poggendorff ring which are in good agreement with corresponding experimental results . </S>"
