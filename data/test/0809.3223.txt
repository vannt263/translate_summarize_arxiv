    "the problem of glass transition has been widely discussed @xcite , and has been considered as one of the deepest and most interesting challenges in physics @xcite . as widely perceived , a glass transition theory should provide a consistent explanation of several universal properties of liquids which set in on lowering the temperature , including the physical origin of the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) law , slow non - exponential relaxation and dynamic crossovers @xcite .",
    "the most widely studied property is the unusual behaviour of liquid relaxation time , @xmath1 . on lowering the temperature ,",
    "@xmath1 is almost never arrhenius , but follows the vft law : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants @xcite .",
    "as recently reviewed @xcite , the quest to understand the origin of the vft law and other anomalous features of glass transition has resulted in the development of many theories and models , which discuss different parameters that control glass transition : free volume , entropy , energy landscape , mode coupling and others . however , there is no agreement as to what physical parameter governs glass transition @xcite . for this and other reasons ,",
    "it has been proposed that glass transition remains a mystery , with no simple picture emerging @xcite .",
    "existing theories are often elaborate , and approach glass transition as an outstanding phenomenon that requires novel or special ideas and mechanisms @xcite .",
    "yet we feel that one should be able to describe the process of cooling a liquid to a glass using familiar physical concepts which may , however , operate in a non - trivial and unexpected way .",
    "we suggest that a property relevant to glass transition is elasticity because a glass differs from a liquid only by its ability to support static shear stress .",
    "hence , we approach the problem by asking whether glass transition can be understood on the basis of liquid elastic properties .    elastic approaches to glass transition were discussed previously ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the problem of explaining glass transition from the first principles remains .",
    "consequently , there is no microscopic understanding of the origin of the vft law , slow relaxation , dynamic crossovers and other effects of glass transition .",
    "recently , we proposed that several important properties of glass transition can be understood on the basis of elastic waves in a liquid @xcite .",
    "we considered the case when a liquid is perturbed and relaxes to equilibrium .",
    "however , it is important to consider elastic waves that originate from local atomic jumps in an equilibrium liquid .",
    "the main question is why and how these waves can result in the slowing down of liquid dynamics , the vft law and dynamic crossovers .    in this paper , we develop and extend our approach to glass transition .",
    "considering several anomalous , yet universal relaxation laws discussed above , we explore non - trivial and unusual ways in which liquid elastic properties may emerge during glass transition .",
    "we analyze elastic waves originating from atomic jumps in a liquid , and find that their effect is to create a dynamic compressive stress which slows down relaxation of other events .",
    "the non - trivial point is that the range of propagation of these waves increases with liquid relaxation time .",
    "a self - consistent calculation shows that this increase gives the vft law . in the proposed theory",
    ", we discuss the origin of two dynamic crossovers in a liquid , the absence of divergence of @xmath1 at @xmath4 , the effect of volume on @xmath1 and the origin of liquid fragility .",
    "unlike in solids , atoms in liquids are not fixed in space , but are constantly rearranging .",
    "this gives liquid flow .",
    "each flow event is a jump of an atom from its surrounding `` cage '' , accompanied by large - scale rearrangement of the cage atoms .",
    "we call this process a local relaxation event ( lre ) .",
    "a lre lasts on the order of debye vibration period @xmath50.1 ps .",
    "there are two known basic properties of lres .",
    "the first property concerns liquid relaxation time , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 was phenomenologically introduced by maxwell in the viscoelastic picture of flow as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is liquid viscosity and @xmath8 is the instantaneous shear modulus @xcite .",
    "frenkel offered microscopic interpretation of @xmath1 as the time between lres at one point in space in a liquid @xcite . at high temperature , @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath1 increases to @xmath10 s at glass transition temperature @xmath11 , a liquid , by convention , forms a glass @xcite .",
    "the second property is that a lre requires an increase of local volume . as widely discussed @xcite ,",
    "the activation barrier for a lre at constant cage volume is very large due to strong short - range interatomic repulsions .",
    "hence , atoms in the cage need to increase its volume in order to allow for the escape of the central atom ( see fig 1a ) . in doing so",
    ", work is performed to deform the surrounding liquid .",
    "this probes liquid elasticity .",
    "the work against the elastic force is equal to the activation barrier for a lre , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this barrier is surmounted by temperature fluctuations , so that @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "an important insight into glass transition comes from the realization that lres interact elastically , as we have recently proposed @xcite .",
    "a lre involves restructuring of the cage that involves large - amplitude atomic motions of about of 12   ( see fig .",
    "1a ) . on the very short time scale of a lre ( when @xmath15 ) , the surrounding liquid can be viewed as an elastic medium @xcite .",
    "therefore , the large atomic motion from a lre elastically deforms the surrounding liquid , inducing elastic waves . because their wavelengths are on the order of interatomic separations , the frequency of these waves , @xmath16 , is on the order of debye frequency .",
    "this means that in almost entire range of @xmath1 that is relevant for glass transition , @xmath17 holds true . as discussed by frenkel",
    ", high - frequency @xmath17 waves are propagating in a liquid as in a solid @xcite .",
    "the existence of propagating high - frequency waves in liquids is now firmly established : the conclusion from numerous experiments is that liquids support vibrational modes which extend down to wavelengths comparable to interatomic separations , similar to phonons in solids @xcite .",
    "the propagating high - frequency waves from a lre deform the cages around other atoms in a liquid .",
    "this affects their relaxation because , as discussed above , the jump of an atom depends on its cage .",
    "therefore , lres _",
    "interact _ via the elastic waves they induce .",
    "elastic interaction between lres is the physical origin of _ cooperativity _ of relaxation in a liquid , whose physical origin has been much discussed , but remained unclear @xcite .",
    "the key issue is the range of this interaction .",
    "lets consider how a solid - like elastic wave is affected by lres in a liquid .",
    "because @xmath1 sets the period of structural rearrangements in a liquid , it defines the time of decay of induced static shear stress @xcite as well as of high - frequency ( @xmath17 ) solid - like propagating waves @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath1 is similar for high - frequency shear and longitudinal stress @xcite .",
    "if @xmath18 is the speed of sound , @xmath19 gives the length of stress decay :    @xmath20    at the microscopic level , @xmath19 originates as follows . a high - frequency @xmath17 wave induced by a lre propagates as in a solid until a remote lre takes place at the wave front . at this point ,",
    "atoms in the wave front do not pass the oscillations further on as in a solid with constant structure , but are involved in large scale structural fluctuation due to the lre motion .",
    "hence , the solid - like elastic wave is absorbed by the motion of the liquid - like atomic cluster due to the lre .",
    "suppose the remote lre meets the wave front distance @xmath0 away from the original lre .",
    "@xmath0 is defined from the equality of the wave travel time , @xmath21 , and the time at which the remote lre takes place at point @xmath0 .",
    "the latter time is given by @xmath1 because microscopically , @xmath1 is the average time between lres at one point in space , and we find @xmath19 as before .    hence , @xmath19 is the distance over which a high - frequency wave propagates in a liquid as it would in a solid without its structure being modified by lres . in an ideal crystal with infinite @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) gives the infinite range of wave propagation , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath19 is in agreement with frenkel s theory of viscoelastic relaxation in a liquid . in this theory ,",
    "waves in a liquid decay with distance @xmath22 as @xmath23 . using the condition @xmath24",
    "explicitly , frenkel s theory gives @xmath25 .",
    "this is discussed in detail in the appendix .",
    "we emphasize that similar to frenkel s theory , our derivation of @xmath19 is also based on the condition @xmath24 , albeit implicitly . indeed",
    ", we approached a liquid from the solid ( elastic ) phase , and considered how solid - like waves are affected by lres in a liquid .",
    "this approach is therefore based on the assertion that solid - like elastic equilibrium exists in a liquid , which is the case for high - frequency @xmath17 waves .",
    "the non - trivial point here is that @xmath19 _ increases _ with @xmath1 .",
    "this is directly opposite to the usual decay of hydrodynamic waves , whose propagation range varies as @xmath26 ( see also , appendix ) .",
    "crucially , this is because the considered solid - like elastic regime of wave propagation ( @xmath24 ) is markedly different from the commonly discussed hydrodynamic regime ( @xmath27 ) . in the latter ,",
    "lres are frequent enough to eliminate the state of elastic equilibrium , and establish hydrodynamic equilibrium instead .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are those of hydrodynamics and viscous flow @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these equations are widely used to describe liquid dynamics and glass transition , yet they are not applicable to our approach to glass transition based on high - frequency interactions .",
    "the presence of these interactions makes our approach essentially non - hydrodynamic , but elastic instead .",
    "@xmath0 can be called liquid elasticity length , because it defines the range over which two lres interact with each other via induced high - frequency elastic waves .",
    "importantly , @xmath19 _ increases _ on lowering the temperature because @xmath1 increases .",
    "we propose that this is the key to the problem of glass transition .",
    "we finish this section with a comment regarding the generality of our discussion . depending on liquid structure and interactions",
    ", lres may take different form .",
    "for example , a lre in covalent network liquids may involve bond switching from under- to over - coordinated states , whereas in spherically symmetric systems ( e. g. , ionic or metallic ) it may resemble an illustration in fig .",
    "1 . hence , the way in which high - frequency waves are generated by lres may be system - specific",
    ". however , the interaction of lres via induced elastic waves is general , and should apply to all liquids undergoing glass transition , including covalent , ionic , molecular , metallic , polymeric and others .",
    "consequently , we expect that the vft law , dynamic crossovers and other effects of glass transition discussed below can be understood on the basis of elastic interactions and @xmath0 .",
    "lets consider the nature of lre - induced waves in more detail . in between lres , atoms in a given local region vibrate with small amplitudes as in a solid ( glass ) @xcite , and a harmonic approximation can be applied to the same extent as to the solid phase . as discussed above",
    ", a lre involves large - scale atomic motions of 12  .",
    "this considerably widens the distribution of interatomic separations @xmath28 . at large @xmath28 ,",
    "harmonic approximation no longer applies , and the potential anharmonicity becomes important .",
    "in particular , the decrease of @xmath28 results in short - range repulsion that is always stronger than the attraction due to the same increase of @xmath28 . because expansion carries smaller energy penalty , large - amplitude motion of atoms involved in a lre results in short - lived expansion of local volume around the lre . in a simplified picture ,",
    "this process can be thought of as the appearance of `` hot '' local regions in a liquid due to lre motion and associated local thermal expansion .",
    "local volume expansion is propagated away from a lre by high - frequency elastic waves discussed above .",
    "we note that when a sphere expands in a static elastic medium , no compression takes place at any point .",
    "instead , the system expands by the amount equal to the increase of the sphere volume @xcite , resulting in a pure shear deformation .",
    "the strain components @xmath29 from an expanding sphere ( noting that @xmath300 as @xmath31 ) are @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xcite , giving pure shear @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", the energy to statically expand the sphere of radius @xmath35 by amount @xmath28 depends on shear modulus @xmath36 only : @xmath37 @xcite .    unlike in the static case",
    ", there is compression at the front of the expanding wave . at time @xmath38",
    ", the wave front causes an outward displacement of atoms on the sphere of radius @xmath39 .",
    "this takes place during time @xmath40 , i.e. very fast , because the wave is due to the remote lre that lasts approximately @xmath40 .",
    "until this displacement causes the motion of the next concentric sphere with radius of @xmath41 , where @xmath22 is on the order of the interatomic separation , there exists a brief compressive stress in a layer of thickness @xmath22 .",
    "this stress exists over time approximately equal to the period of vibrations of the system of two atoms , or @xmath40 , i.e. is very short .",
    "as the wave propagates further , dynamic compression between the two layers disappears , and shear deformation is established as discussed above .",
    "lets now fix an atomic cage in the centre in fig .",
    "as the front of the wave propagating volume expansion from a remote lre arrives at the centre , it causes a brief compressive stress between the cage boundary atoms and the atoms in the next layer that include the central atom ( see fig .",
    "hence , it puts the cage atoms under _ dynamic compressive stress _ ( dcs ) . because , as discussed above , the jump of the central atom requires cage expansion , the compressive wave fronts arriving at the centre result in more work needed to expand the cage .",
    "this increases the activation barrier for the central lre , @xmath12 , and slows down liquid dynamics .",
    "we emphasize that dcs in a liquid is created by new elastic waves , which are notably absent in solids , and which propagate local volume expansions from the hot ( in the sense discussed above ) local regions .",
    "this process can be compared to pressure waves generated by local laser heating of a solid . in this case , the energy that heats up local regions and creates these pressure waves is external . in a liquid ,",
    "the energy to create dcs is internal , i.e. it is the liquid s thermal energy . here ,",
    "as temperature increases and the liquid state is approached from the solid phase , lres appear as a new type of `` hot '' local motion .",
    "this motion gives rise to a new set of expanding elastic waves , and dcs emerges as a result .",
    "the stage is now set for the calculation of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath12 is equal to the total work required to expand the cage by the amount required for a lre to take place @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 can be written as @xmath42 . here",
    ", @xmath43 is the high - temperature activation barrier that depends on liquid interatomic forces and structure , but not on the elastic interactions with other lres , i.e. is non - cooperative , or intrinsic .",
    "@xmath44 represents the interaction ( cooperative ) term .",
    "@xmath44 is equal to the additional work to expand the cage due to the arriving compressive wave fronts from other lres , and is set dynamically .",
    "let @xmath45 be the increase of the cage volume required for a lre to take place .",
    "@xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the interatomic separation of about 1  . as discussed above",
    ", dcs exists in the arriving wave front , in a layer of thickness @xmath47 . lets consider dcs created by a remote lre @xmath48 distance @xmath35 away from the centre in figure 1b .",
    "if @xmath49 is the value of dcs at the centre , the remote lre contributes @xmath50 to @xmath44 .",
    "then , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of compressive wave fronts that pass through the centre during time @xmath1 , and @xmath12 reads :    @xmath53    according to eq . ( [ 2 ] ) , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) includes elastic waves from lres inside the sphere of radius @xmath19 .",
    "importantly , each of the local relaxing regions inside this sphere contributes to the sum once .",
    "this is due to two reasons .",
    "first , because the central event relaxes during time @xmath1 , waves from all the events located distance @xmath54 away from the centre have enough time to propagate to the central point .",
    "second , because a remote event also relaxes during time @xmath1 , it contributes only one wave during the time of relaxation of the central event .",
    "hence , the introduced length @xmath19 is self - consistent in that it accounts for the dynamical nature of lres as well as for the wave dissipation .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ 1 ] ) can be written as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the density of local relaxing regions and @xmath57 is the region diameter of about 10  .",
    "@xmath58 decreases with @xmath35 .",
    "recall that the short - lived dcs from a lre originates at time @xmath38 in a thin layer of thickness @xmath22 , when the outward motion of atoms takes place in a sphere of radius @xmath39 , but not yet in a sphere of radius @xmath41 . the strain and stress on the sphere of radius @xmath39 decay as in elastic medium .",
    "this is because the waves under consideration are of high frequency ( @xmath17 ) and therefore propagate in elastic equilibrium as discussed above . in elastic medium ,",
    "the strain on an expanded sphere ( i.e. on the sphere of radius @xmath39 ) decays as @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this strain creates @xmath60 which , therefore , also decays as @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the value of @xmath60 at the cage boundary , distance @xmath63 away from the centre of a relaxing region .",
    "then , @xmath64 , and eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) becomes    @xmath65    according to eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath12 increases with @xmath0 . because @xmath19 itself increases with @xmath1 and hence , with @xmath12 , @xmath12",
    "is defined self - consistently . combining @xmath19 with @xmath13 and noting that @xmath66 ,",
    "we write    @xmath67    putting this in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , we find    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 . from eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , the vft law follows .    in this theory ,",
    "the origin of the vft law is the increase of @xmath0 on lowering the temperature ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) ) .",
    "this increase results in a larger number of lres that elastically interact with a given event , increasing its activation barrier .",
    "the transition from the vft to the arrhenius law takes place in the limit of small @xmath0 at high temperature . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) gives @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath12 becomes non - cooperative and temperature - independent .",
    "this gives arrhenius relaxation : @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath69 can be roughly estimated by recalling that @xmath62 is created by local volume increase due to anharmonicity . because this increase gives rise to macroscopic thermal expansion",
    ", @xmath62 can be estimated as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is bulk modulus , @xmath75 is the coefficient of thermal expansion and @xmath76 is the temperature of local motion during a lre , which is on the order of melting temperature .",
    "taking @xmath77 @xmath78 and typical liquid values of @xmath79 gpa and @xmath80 k@xmath81 , we find @xmath82 , in order - of - magnitude agreement with experimental values @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath4 in the derived vft law is related to liquid parameters that are physically sensible .",
    "in addition to temperature , our theory also predicts the dependence of @xmath1 on volume or pressure . according to recent experiments , @xmath1 is a function of both temperature and volume , although temperature has a larger overall effect @xcite . in our theory",
    ", pressure has two effects : first , @xmath45 becomes larger by the amount equal to the decrease of the cage volume due to external pressure @xmath83 , so that the new @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the initial cage volume .",
    "second , the activation barrier @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , and hence the vft parameter @xmath3 , acquire an additional term @xmath86 due to the increased work against the external pressure .    an interesting prediction is the dependence of @xmath4 on pressure : because @xmath69 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) ) , its value under pressure , @xmath87 , is @xmath88 . for small @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath74 increases linearly with pressure : @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is zero - pressure bulk modulus and @xmath91 is a constant , giving @xmath92 .",
    "then , for small @xmath93 , @xmath94 . this behaviour is observed in the experiments : at small @xmath83 , @xmath4 increases linearly with @xmath83 , with a negative quadratic term appearing at higher @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we now discuss how our theory explains the origin of dynamic crossovers , the important problem of glass transition @xcite . experimentally , there are _ two _ dynamic crossovers in a liquid .",
    "the _ first",
    "_ crossover is at high temperature , and marks the transition from exponential to slow stretched - exponential dynamics and from arrhenius to vft relaxation .",
    "the physical origin of this crossover has remained one of the central open questions in the area of glass transition @xcite .",
    "for various liquids , @xmath1 at the crossover is @xmath95 ps @xcite .    in our theory ,",
    "the origin of this crossover is understood as follows . at high temperature",
    "when @xmath96 , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) gives @xmath97  .",
    "therefore , at high temperature elastic waves from lres do not propagate beyond the nearest - neighbour distance .",
    "this means that @xmath98   is shorter than the distance between two neighbouring lres , or two adjacent molecular cages , @xmath99 , which varies from @xmath100   in small - molecule to @xmath101   in large - molecule liquids . because @xmath102 , lres do not elastically interact and , therefore , relax as independent , resulting in exponential and arrhenius relaxation . on the other hand , when @xmath0 increases to @xmath99 on lowering the temperature ,",
    "lres are no longer independent , but start interacting via the induced elastic waves .",
    "this interaction gives the vft law as discussed above and , as we recently showed @xcite , stretched - exponential relaxation .",
    "therefore , the first crossover corresponds to @xmath103 . from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath1 at the first crossover , @xmath104 , is    @xmath105    giving @xmath106 ps , consistent with the experimental results .",
    "the _ second _ dynamic crossover is at low temperature , and marks another qualitative change in liquid dynamics @xcite .",
    "the important change is the crossover from the vft law to a more arrhenius behaviour .",
    "starting from the early work in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was realized that at low temperature the vft law predicts viscosity and @xmath12 that are larger than those experimentally measured .",
    "moreover , the experimental @xmath12 at low temperature becomes temperature - independent , contrary to its continuous increase predicted by the vft law .",
    "the crossover from the vft law to a more arrhenius form at low temperature has now been established in a large number of glass - forming liquids @xcite .",
    "the origin of this crossover is not understood at present .    in our theory , the origin of this crossover is as follows .",
    "when @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is system size , all lres in the system elastically interact .",
    "this gives temperature - independent @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath12 can not increase due to the increase of @xmath0 on lowering the temperature , but due to other effects only ( e.g. , density increase ) . as a result , @xmath1 crosses over to a more arrhenius form .",
    "hence , the second crossover corresponds to @xmath107 . from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath1 at the second crossover , @xmath110 , is    @xmath111    taking a typical experimental value of @xmath108 in the range of 0.110 mm , we find @xmath112 s. this is in good agreement with @xmath1 of the crossover from the vft to a more arrhenius relaxation seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath110 agrees well with the experimental @xmath1 at which other important liquid properties show a crossover and undergo qualitative changes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the two dynamic crossovers originate in our theory in a simple and physically transparent way .",
    "derived solely from the definition of @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath113 and @xmath114 give good agreement with the experiments , without using adjustable parameters .",
    "this lends support to the proposed theory of glass transition .",
    "importantly , the origin of the second dynamic crossover in this theory allows us to reconcile what is perhaps the main ongoing controversy surrounding glass transition , that of divergence @xcite .",
    "formally , @xmath1 in the vft law diverges at @xmath4 .",
    "although @xmath4 is always smaller than @xmath11 , it is natural to ask what the physical significance of @xmath4 is . starting from early theories of glass transition ,",
    "@xmath4 has been associated with a phase transition into a state of zero configurational entropy termed `` ideal glass '' @xcite .",
    "confounded by a number of problems @xcite , this approach was followed by other divergence scenarios of glass transition that were based on the existence of an underlying or avoided phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the phase transition and the second phase itself remain unclear , primarily because no long - range order or any other appreciable structural changes appear on cooling @xcite .",
    "moreover , as recently emphasized , there are no experimentally observed signs of divergence @xcite .",
    "these issues continue to fuel the current debate about whether divergence exists and if so , what it means .",
    "the problem is often formulated as whether glass transition is a thermodynamic or dynamic phenomenon @xcite .    in our theory , this controversy is reconciled as follows . combining eqs .",
    "( [ 41 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , we write    @xmath115    when @xmath116 approaches @xmath4 , @xmath0 quickly exceeds any finite size of the system . at this point ,",
    "@xmath1 crosses over to more arrhenius as discussed above , moving the divergence to zero temperature .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 does not diverge at @xmath4 .",
    "we note that in addition to a seeming divergence of @xmath1 at @xmath4 , approaches to glass transition based on thermodynamics and phase transitions have also been stimulated by the experimental changes of heat capacity , compressibility and other properties at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "as we recently discussed @xcite , these changes can be understood as a natural signature of @xmath11 insofar as @xmath11 is defined by the freezing of lres at the experimental time scale . in other words ,",
    "the observed changes are related to a liquid falling out of equilibrium at @xmath11 , rather than to thermodynamics or a phase transition @xcite .",
    "our theory readily explains the origin of liquid fragility @xcite , a widely debated subject in the area of glass transition .",
    "such an explanation was offered in our recent paper @xcite , which we briefly recall below .",
    "lets consider two extreme cases of `` strong '' sio@xmath117 and `` fragile '' _ o_-terphenyl ( see fig .",
    "( 2 ) ) and calculate @xmath0 at the highest measured temperature , @xmath118 . from fig . ( 2 ) , @xmath119 is approximately 10@xmath120 s and 10@xmath121 s for sio@xmath117 and _ o_-terphenyl , respectively . taking @xmath122 m / s , @xmath123 is about 0.1 mm for sio@xmath117 and 1 nm for _ o_-terphenyl .",
    "hence , @xmath0 for _ o_-terphenyl grows from microscopic to macroscopic values on lowering the temperature .",
    "this gives large increase of cooperativity and @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , i.e. fragile behaviour . on the other hand , @xmath0 for sio@xmath117 approaches system size at @xmath118 already , leaving little room for the cooperativity and @xmath12 to grow on lowering the temperature ( see eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) ) .",
    "this gives strong behaviour .",
    "in this theory , liquids that have large intrinsic activation barrier and large viscosity ( @xmath1 ) also have large @xmath0 , even at high temperature .",
    "this gives little room for @xmath12 to grow , resulting in strong behaviour . on the other hand , liquids that have small viscosity at high temperature and , consequently , small @xmath0 ,",
    "show large increase of @xmath12 on lowering the temperature , i.e. are fragile .",
    "an interesting prediction of our theory is that if the measurements are extended to higher temperature so that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are small , liquids will become more fragile .",
    "note that there is no data for strong liquids in the range of small @xmath1 @xcite ( see also , fig .",
    "( 2 ) ) due to high melting points , and the evidence for arrhenius behaviour comes only from the range where @xmath1 is large .    in our theory",
    ", fragility can be quantitatively related to other system properties .",
    "fragility is quantified by parameter @xmath124 @xcite ; the larger @xmath125 the smaller fragility . in our theory , @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and below ) , giving @xmath126 . therefore",
    ", fragility is predicted to decrease with the scaled high - temperature activation barrier @xmath43 .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental data showing the decrease of fragility with @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "we make two remarks about dcs . first , if the frequency of compressive wave fronts arriving at the centre in fig .",
    "1b is large enough , the atoms in the central cage may , at first glance , appear to be under an effective static stress .",
    "the necessary condition for this is that the average time difference between any two compressive arriving wave fronts , @xmath128 , is shorter than the minimal time set by the elementary vibration period @xmath40 : @xmath129 .",
    "as discussed above , the central region is affected by all events inside the sphere of radius @xmath19 , each contributing once . hence , there are @xmath130 contributing local relaxing regions inside the sphere of radius @xmath54 .",
    "the central event relaxes during time @xmath1 , hence the average time between the wave fronts arriving at the centre is @xmath131 . because @xmath132 , the condition @xmath133 gives @xmath134 . denoting    @xmath135",
    "we find that @xmath1361 ps , i.e. is very short .    as discussed in the previous section , @xmath0 exceeds the experimental system size @xmath108 above @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", we should substitute @xmath54 for @xmath108 , and the condition @xmath133 gives @xmath137 . denoting    @xmath138    and using a typical value of @xmath108 of 1 mm",
    ", we find @xmath139 s. because @xmath140 , the condition @xmath133 is also satisfied when @xmath141 for a macroscopic system .",
    "therefore , the necessary condition for the cage atoms to be under the static stress ( @xmath133 ) is fulfilled in a very wide range of @xmath1 , including glass transformation range . however , the actual value of this stress , @xmath142 , vanishes for @xmath143 .",
    "indeed , the contributions from arriving compressive wave fronts to the static stress can be summed on the time scale of @xmath40 only , for two reasons .",
    "first , wave fronts from remote lres add up only if they arrive simultaneously , or in practice during the elementary time period @xmath40 .",
    "second , the duration of the passing wave front is also @xmath40 , because the lifetime of the remote lre that creates the wave is about @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath142 can be calculated as    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the density of those remote local regions that give rise to the waves passing through the centre during time @xmath40 .",
    "the number of the wave fronts that pass through the centre during time @xmath40 is @xmath146 .",
    "combining this with @xmath147 from above gives @xmath148 .",
    "hence , @xmath149 , where @xmath56 is the density of local relaxing regions introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) . using @xmath145 in eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) and recalling that @xmath150 and @xmath64 , we write    @xmath151    therefore , @xmath142 vanishes for @xmath143 , i.e. for @xmath1 at which @xmath0 and elastic interactions between lres become appreciable in the first place ( see the previous section ) . as a result , dcs does _ not _ contribute to liquid internal pressure or equilibrium volume .",
    "physically , this is because the volume of local regions that contribute to @xmath142 is sparse .",
    "we note that the vanishing of @xmath142 is in contrast to the behaviour of @xmath12 which increases with @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath12 is given by the total work to be performed against cage expansion @xcite .",
    "because each lre compresses the central cage , this work , being an extensive quantity , is the sum over all pulses that arrive during time @xmath1 from within the sphere of radius @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath12 increases with the number of contributing lres and @xmath0 .    the second remark about dcs concerns eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . after the initial expansion due to a lre",
    ", a remote local region relaxes back to its original equilibrium volume , sending a dilatational wave to the centre .",
    "however , the dynamic dilatational stress , @xmath152 , and the dynamic compressive stress , @xmath153 , do not oscillate around an equilibrium value as in a harmonic wave , but are set by processes that operate on different time scales ( or , equivalently , length scales , see below ) , making propagating density variations essentially anharmonic . recall that @xmath153 is due to fast expansion originating from anharmonic forces that initially appear between several ( 35 ) `` hot '' atoms of the remote lre during the elementary vibration period @xmath154 ps . as the expanding wave propagates",
    ", fast dynamic compression is created between the two adjacent atomic layers when one layer is already displaced during @xmath40 but the other is not .    on the other hand , dilatation that sets @xmath152 and originates from cooling and contraction of the remote relaxing region is a slower process for the following reason .",
    "let @xmath155 be the time during which @xmath152 exists .",
    "@xmath155 is set by the time during which increased interatomic separations in the expanded remote region , @xmath28 , return to their original ( pre - lre ) values , @xmath156 .",
    "this process involves the number of atoms that is necessarily larger than the number of initially hot atoms , because these hot atoms interact with their neighbours . as a result of this interaction , large @xmath28 between the initially hot atoms",
    "are distributed over a larger region .",
    "this is accompanied by a gradual reduction of @xmath28 .",
    "as thermalization of the local region proceeds and @xmath157 is established for all atoms involved , the dilatation of the relaxing region is complete",
    ". therefore , @xmath155 is set by the time of thermalization of atoms affected by the lre motion .",
    "this thermalization involves at least the nearest neighbours of the initially hot atoms , hence @xmath155 is the time of thermalization of the region whose size is at least equal to the cage size @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the lower limit of @xmath155 can be estimated as @xmath158 1 ps , because thermalization can not proceed faster than the phonon speed , and we find @xmath1591 ps . hence , @xmath160 .",
    "interestingly , a similar effect is observed in molecular dynamics simulations of radiation damage .",
    "here , a hot radiation cascade created by an energetic ion elastically deforms the surrounding lattice .",
    "it is found that fast initial expansion of the lattice is followed by considerably slower contraction due to finite thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "@xmath160 means that @xmath161 .",
    "a mechanical analogy of this effect is compression of a spring due to a fast compressive force applied to one end , followed by slow motion in the opposite direction during which the spring length hardly changes .",
    "@xmath162 can be related to @xmath163 as follows .",
    "lets consider that the boundary atom in the central cage is pushed towards the central atom by force @xmath164 due to compressive stress @xmath153 , followed by the motion in the opposite direction caused by force @xmath165 due to dilatational stress @xmath152 that arrives later .",
    "let @xmath166 be forward and reverse displacement of the boundary atom due to @xmath153 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "assuming constant acceleration , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the atomic mass .",
    "then , @xmath170 .",
    "hence , @xmath161 because @xmath171 .",
    "@xmath162 can also be written as the ratio of the short - range and medium - range order distances , @xmath172 . using @xmath173 and @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "hence , @xmath161 because @xmath176 .",
    "physically , this result has the following meaning .",
    "a statement equivalent to @xmath171 is the assertion that the wavelength of the initial compressive wave is comparable with interatomic separations in the central cage ( because this wave is created by fast expansion of the remote cage ) , whereas the wavelength of the following dilatational wave is larger than the cage size due to slow contraction .",
    "hence , interatomic separations in the central cage decrease in the first case , whereas the cage moves as a whole in the second , resulting in @xmath161 .    from @xmath161 , @xmath177 follows , i.e. the negative work due to @xmath152 is small , and can be ignored in eq .",

    "in summary , we proposed that the properties of glass transition can be understood on the basis of elastic waves in a liquid .",
    "elastic waves originating from atomic jumps in a liquid create a dynamic compressive stress , which slows down relaxation .",
    "the increase of @xmath0 on lowering the temperature gives the vft law .",
    "in addition to temperature , we also predicted the effect of volume on @xmath1 . in the proposed theory , we discussed the origin of dynamic crossovers , the absence of divergence of @xmath1 at @xmath4 , the effect of volume on @xmath1 and the origin of liquid fragility .",

    "( [ 2 ] ) and the result from the viscoelastic theory of frenkel @xcite .",
    "the relevant part of frenkel s discussion starts with the modification of elasticity equations due to relaxation process in a liquid .",
