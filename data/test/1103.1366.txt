    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations provides the only firm evidence for new physics we currently have  @xcite , namely neutrino mass .",
    "this constitutes the most important discovery in particle physics in the last quarter century , implying that the standard model , which correctly accounts for all other experimental data in particle physics , needs revision  @xcite .",
    "precision is the keyword in neutrino physics today , including solar and atmospheric neutrino data analysis , as well as the determination of neutrino masses and mixing parameters at reactor and long - baseline accelerator experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is important not only to investigate the potential of current and upcoming long baseline experiments to determine the neutrino oscillation parameters , but also to probe for the possible existence of non - standard neutrino interactions , nsi , for short .",
    "the latter are expected in most models of neutrino mass generation , such as seesaw - type schemes  @xcite and will play a crucial role since they will shed light on the scale characterizing this so - far elusive mass generation mechanism .",
    "the interest on probing for the existence of nsi has been growing over recent years , thanks also to the increasing precision of upcoming experiments  @xcite and to the fact that the current oscillation interpretation is not yet fully robust  @xcite so one needs to scrutinize the interplay between oscillations and nsi in future experiments  @xcite .",
    "a wide class of non - standard neutrino interactions may be parametrized at low energies by the effective lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi constant and the parameters @xmath3 characterize the strength of the nsi . for simplicity ,",
    "these are assumed to be real .",
    "the chiral projectors @xmath4 denote @xmath5 , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 label the three neutrino flavors , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a first generation charged sm fermion ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) .",
    "collider experiments produce well - controlled and clean muon neutrino beams , with just a small component of electron neutrinos , while tau neutrino beams are unavailable . as a result",
    "one can expect that the muon neutrino nsi parameters , @xmath14 are better constrained in comparison with other neutrino flavors .",
    "this is indeed the case for the interaction with electrons  @xcite .",
    "however , for the interaction of neutrinos with quarks , although neutrino nucleon scattering has a very long history since cdhs  @xcite and charm  @xcite , the accuracy of these early experiments was worse than that of the more recent nutev experiment , which has measured the @xmath15 interaction with a very high accuracy  @xcite , reporting a discrepancy with the standard model predictions .",
    "while this may be interpreted as a hint of new physics , indicating at face - value a potentially non - zero value for the nsi parameters @xmath16  @xcite , uncertainties coming from qcd corrections might have been underestimated  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as expected , limits on muon neutrino nsi coupling strengths  @xcite derived on the basis of 1-loop dressing of the neutrino effective four - fermion vertex can not be formulated rigorously .",
    "indeed these are highly model dependent and , even when a full analysis is performed , including all the necessary diagrams required in order to obtain gauge - invariance , one does not strongly constrain the flavor changing parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite .    recently , two new determinations of the standard model electroweak mixing parameter @xmath19 from the nutev measurement have been presented  @xcite .",
    "given that the most stringent model  independent bounds on @xmath20 come from the nutev data , it is necessary to consider the effect of including these new corrections on the nutev results .",
    "therefore , the main goal of this paper is to the review the current status of the constraints for the @xmath21 non - standard neutrino interactions in view of the larger uncertainties indicated by these recent papers . in so - doing",
    "we will not only take into account the new results mentioned above , but also combine the laboratory constraints with the restrictions inferred from the analysis of atmospheric neutrino data . in order to obtain these constraints we adopt as a simplifying working hypotesis that all nsi parameters other than @xmath22 vanish .",
    "we will see that restricting ourselves to a two - generation nsi global analysis we obtain relatively stringent constraints on the nsi interactions for muon neutrinos , at the few @xmath23 level , thanks largely to the interplay of atmospheric data .",
    "the paper is planned as follows . in the next section",
    "we will make a brief description of the neutrino nucleon scattering parameters that are relevant for our analysis . in section  [ sec : constr - from - nutev ]",
    ", we will discuss the nutev data and their implications for the nsi parameters , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : constr - from - charm ] we discuss the previous experiments charm and cdhs . in section  [ sec : comb - with - atmosph ] we combine this information with constraints coming from the analysis of atmospheric neutrinos in order to obtain global constraints on the nsi parameters .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl - future - prosp ] we will give our conclusions and discuss the prospects for further improvement in the determination of nsi parameters .",
    "neutrino scattering experiments provide one of the most precise probes of the weak neutral current , and have been often been used to measure the electroweak mixing angle @xmath19 . in particular , it has been shown that experiments with an isoscalar target are particularly convenient , since in this case the uncertainties due to unknown corrections to the qcd parton model cancel to a large extent  @xcite . for an isoscalar target of up and down - type quarks , the largest contributions to the neutral and charged current cross sections",
    "are related by isospin invariance and their ratio can be written as : @xmath25 @xmath26 where one introduces the ratio @xmath27 and the coupling constants are defined as @xmath28 with p = l , r . in the presence of nsi of muon neutrinos with quarks , these coupling constants are replaced by : @xmath29    the quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been measured in the past at the cdhs  @xcite and charm experiments  @xcite . another well - known observable for the study of deep inelastic neutrino scattering on an isoscalar target is the paschos - wolfenstein ( pw ) ratio defined as  @xcite @xmath32 this ratio is particularly useful because it depends very weakly on the hadronic structure of the nucleus target and it is largely insensitive to the uncertainties resulting from charm production as well as charm and strange sea distributions .",
    "however , the simultaneous measurement of neutral current cross sections for neutrinos and antineutrinos requires the use of separate neutrino and antineutrino beams .",
    "the nutev collaboration makes use of this observable in order to measure the electroweak mixing angle .",
    "actually , they measure experimentally the ratios @xmath33 and @xmath34 , shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ratio - nu ] ) and ( [ eq : ratio - antinu ] ) , which later transform in the paschos - wolfenstein ratio @xmath35 through their fit procedure .",
    "the nutev collaboration used high statistics neutrino and antineutrino beams to measure their neutral and charged current cross sections on an iron target . using a statistical separation of the nc and cc event candidates , based on the length of each event in the detector , nutev reported experimental values for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as mentioned in the previous section",
    ". a numerical fit of these results provides a measurement of the left and right  handed neutral couplings to the light quarks  @xcite : @xmath36 notice the discrepancy with respect to the standard model expectations  @xcite : @xmath37 due to the nutev preference for a lower effective left  handed coupling , almost 3@xmath38 away from the sm expectation .",
    "similarly , a value for the electroweak mixing angle in the on  shell scheme was obtained from a numerical fit : @xmath39 which is @xmath40 away from the value determined in global precision electroweak fits  @xcite : @xmath41        ascribing the discrepancy between the nutev result for the left coupling @xmath42 and its prediction within the standard model to the existence of a non - zero nsi - operator , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a positive hint for non - zero values of the left flavor - conserving nsi couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 . on the other hand , for the case of flavor changing nsi parameters they obtained limits on the nsi @xmath45 couplings .",
    "however , several corrections and theoretical uncertainties coming , for instance , from nuclear effects and next - to - leading - order corrections were neglected in the original nutev collaboration analysis .",
    "although the presence of nsi could explain the discrepancy of the nutev results with the sm , before claiming that they provide a hint of new physics , one needs make sure that all uncertainties are carefully taken into account . as a matter of fact",
    "several attempts have been made to interpret the nutev results just in terms of conventional physics , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "here we re - analyze the impact of taking into account carefully the uncertainties in deriving restrictions on physics beyond the sm as parametrized by the nsi lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efflag ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the two most recent re - analysis of the nutev data given in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to obtain constraints on neutrino nsi coupling strengths .",
    "the nnpdf collaboration reports more precise estimates of the strange and anti - strange parton distribution functions , leading to a new value for the electroweak mixing angle  @xcite : @xmath46    on the other hand the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite takes into account three different corrections coming from nuclear effects , due to the excess of neutrons in iron , charge symmetry violation arising from up and down quark mass differences , and strange quarks .",
    "with all these corrections included , the following value for the electroweak mixing angle is extracted : @xmath47    one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ sin : nnpdf ] ) and ( [ sin : bentz ] ) that the two re - calculated estimates for the electroweak mixing angle , with larger uncertainties , are consistent with the sm prediction , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sin2 ] . in order to determine the resulting restrictions set by nutev data on the strength of nsi couplings , in view of the corrections discussed above  @xcite",
    ", we adopt the paschos - wolfenstein ratio @xmath35 .",
    "we perform a @xmath48 analysis using the paschos - wolfenstein ratio derived from each re - analysis of nutev data , and we compare these results with the standard model prediction for @xmath35 . as a result of this simple statistical analysis , and allowing for one non - zero nsi coupling at a time , we obtain the following constraints at 90% c.l . :",
    "@xmath49 when using the results in nnpdf , and @xmath50 for the bentz et al . case .",
    "for both analyses we observe two allowed regions for most of the nsi couplings , reflecting the degeneracy seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsi - fd ] .",
    "allowing now for the simultaneous presence of left and right  handed nsi neutrino couplings we obtain the results given in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsi - fd ] . for convenience",
    ", we present the constraints in terms of the vector and axial couplings instead of using the @xmath51 basis .",
    "this makes it easier to proceed when combining with the atmospheric data ( see below ) .",
    "the left panel holds for the case of a down - type quark , while the right one holds for an up - type quark .",
    "one can see that , in both cases , there is a two - fold degeneracy in the values of the nsi parameters , which is easily understood from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pw ] ) , @xmath52 , this equation represents a hyperbola centered at ( @xmath53 , @xmath52 ) = ( -@xmath54 , -@xmath55 ) . after the change of variables to ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 )",
    ", the hyperbola is rotated to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsi - fd ] . ] .        on the other hand , for the case of flavor",
    "changing nsi , our analysis gives the allowed region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsi - fc ] . in this case",
    "the allowed regions for the two chiral components of the flavor - changing nsi couplings of @xmath58- and @xmath13-type quarks are the same , hence we show our results in only one plot .",
    "note that here the allowed region is a hyperbola centered at the origin ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) = ( 0,0 ) , displaying a remnant of the two - fold degeneracy seen for the flavor conserving case . in agreement with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gl - nsi])-([eq : pw ] ) , our analysis constrains the product @xmath61 , and therefore , one coupling could be of order one , provided that the other one is small enough .",
    "as before , the different widths for the allowed regions for each re - analysis of nutev data reflect the experimental errors calculated in each case .",
    "both the charm and cdhs experiments have measured semileptonic neutrino scattering cross sections .",
    "although these early experiments have a lower sensitivity than that reached at the nutev experiment , their data are still useful in our global analysis . while these two experiments can not compete with the nutev sensitivity in constraining the strength of non - universal nsi couplings , they play an important role in restricting that of the flavor changing nsi   and for this reason we consider them in our analysis",
    ". the measurements of these experiments are summarized in table  [ table : exp - values ] .",
    ".ratios of neutral to charged currents measured by charm and cdhs compared with the sm prediction . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have re - analysed the constraints on novel non - standard neutrino interactions of muon neutrinos with quarks which follow from current accelerator experiments .",
    "in particular , we have re - considered the results of the nutev experiment in view of a new evaluation of the nutev systematic uncertainties .",
    "we have combined the restrictions following from accelerator data with those coming from recent atmospheric data analysis , which plays a crucial role in removing degeneracies .",
    "we have found that , although constraints for muon neutrinos are better than those applicable to tau or electron neutrinos , they are not as strong as previously believed . while previous authors report bounds of the order of few @xmath62 , we find that , taking into account the current estimates of the nutev uncertainties , constraints are now of the order of few @xmath63 .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ table : final results ] .",
    "even weaker constraints would hold in a generalized three - generation framework .",
    "although muon neutrino nsi couplings are often neglected  @xcite , one should keep in mind the weakness of the existing limits .",
    "note that these results will not be improved by the inclusion of data from the long baseline experiment minos @xcite , given its poor sensitivity to matter effects when compared with that of atmospheric data , at least in a two - neutrino analysis . as a result minos will not significantly restrict the neutral current nsi couplings discussed here , and the same is expected for opera  @xcite .",
    "however , future `` clean '' measurements of the oscillation parameters combined with the nsi - contaminated parameters determined by atmospheric experiments would be helpful .",
    "certainly it would also help considerably to have a very long baseline setup as envisaged in the long baseline neutrino experiment ( lbne ) project currently proposed , capable of probing earth matter effects with enhanced sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "last , but not least , we note that a new high statistics neutrino scattering experiment , nusong has been proposed  @xcite , with the same goals as nutev",
    ". one of its main tasks would be to probe new physics in the neutrino couplings .",
    "expectations are that nusong would improve the nutev sensitivities on muon - neutrino quark scattering by a factor 2 at least , which would translate into a similar improvement on the nsi sensitivities with respect to those obtained from nutev .",
