    "the modification of magnetic properties of ferro(i)magnetic films ( f ) by antiferromagnetic films ( af ) is of huge physical and technological interest for instance for the development of magnetoresistive ( mr ) devices like magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs)@xcite .",
    "mtjs primarily consist of two ferro(i)magnetic conducting films , which are separated by a non - magnetic insulator . in case both ferro(i)magnetic films",
    "are comprised of the same material , it is essential to shift the coercive field of one of the films .",
    "the af / f exchange coupling causing an exchange bias can be utilized to have two different switching fields .",
    "thus , the magnetization of the films can be switched separately and an alternation of the alignment of the magnetization between parallel and antiparallel is possible .",
    "+ magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) is a promising material for such applications due its half - metallic@xcite character and a high spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "the ferrimagnetic oxide has a high curie temperature ( 860k ) and a saturation moment of almost 4@xmath2 .",
    "it crystallizes in an inverse spinel structure with a cubic lattice constant of 0.83964 nm at 300k .",
    "below the so called verwey temperature t@xmath3 = 120k occurs a phase transition , whereby magnetite adopts a monoclinic structure , becomes insulting and its susceptibility changes .",
    "+ nio is an antiferromagnetic ionic insulator with a high thermal stability .",
    "it is inert against corrosion and has a n@xmath4el temperature of t@xmath5 = 523k and therefore well suited as exchange bias material nio crystallizes in a rock salt structure with a lattice constant of 0.41769 nm .",
    "+ mgo is isostructural to nio with a slightly larger lattice constant of 0.42117 nm .",
    "hence , the lattice mismatch between nio and mgo is about 0.8% while the misfit between fe@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgo is about 0.3% and mgo is apparently well suited as substrate for both .",
    "+ the af / f exchange coupling was first reported in 1957 in co / coo systems@xcite .",
    "this pinning effect increases the coercive field of the f film and leads to a shift of the hysteresis loop by a bias field , the so called exchange bias .",
    "the pinning effect can be induced by cooling the af / f bilayer from high temp through the n@xmath4el temperature of the af under the application of a magnetic field .",
    "+ the exchange bias on fe@xmath0o@xmath1 films has been investigated in prior studies , i.e. by using different substrates to change the growth direction of the af and analyzing the influence of a compensated nio(001 ) and a fully uncompensated nio(111 ) interface on the exchange bias@xcite .",
    "the influence of the stacking order was also examined in that study .",
    "+ models have been developed to describe the exchange bias , i.e a domain state model ( dsm ) based on monte carlo simulations@xcite , which shows that the magnitude of the exchange bias is dependent on the degree of dilution of the antiferromagnet .",
    "this domain state model has been verified by experiments@xcite . + shortly after the exchange coupling , the trainings effect was found , too .",
    "the trainings effect denotes the descending of the initial exchange bias to a smaller residual value during measuring the hysteresis loops .",
    "d. paccard has reported about the training effect@xcite in af / f systems .",
    "+ since the film thickness , the crystal quality of the films and af / f interface structure and roughness strongly influence the magnetic properties of the bilayers , we have investigated the thickness dependence of the strutural quality of fe@xmath0o@xmath1/nio - bilayers on the film thickness of each film .",

    "the xrd data were evaluated using kinematic diffraction theory .",
    "the sample preparation was carried out in multi chamber ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) systems with a preparation chamber ( base pressure of 10@xmath9 mbar ) and an analysis chamber ( base pressure of 10@xmath10 mbar ) .",

    "the preparation chamber is equipped with electron beam evaporators for nickel and iron , a heatable manipulator and an oxygen source .",
    "+ before film deposition the mgo substrates were annealed at 400@xmath12c in a 10@xmath13 mbar oxygen atmosphere to obtain well - ordered and clean surfaces as proved by leed and xps , respectively . after the preparation of the substrates nio films",
    "were deposited using rmbe at 250@xmath12c in a 10@xmath14 mbar oxygen atmosphere .",

    "the strain of the magnetite films has relaxed with increasing film thickness and the critical film thickness is very small .",
    "+ although the structural ordering of the magnetite gets worse , the roughness of the magnetite surface is relative low ranging from 0.1 nm to 0.2 nm .",
    "thus , magnetite films seem to compensate the interface roughness .",
    "only the bilayer with 33 nm nio film thickness in series one and the bilayer with 60 nm magnetite film thickness in series two have a distinct higher roughness with 1 nm .",
    "this can be attributed to the great progression of the structural degradation of the magnetite films .",
    "thus , in order to get structural better magnetite films on thick nio films , the preparation of the fe@xmath0o@xmath1/nio bilayers has to be improved .",
    "therefore , the influence of the growth temperatures of nio and fe@xmath0o@xmath1 on the fe@xmath0o@xmath1-nio interface roughness have to be investigated . as mentiond above a growth temperature of 500@xmath6c leads to a smooth nio film surface .",
    "withal you have to keep in mind that a too high growth temperature may lead to an intermixing of the nio and fe@xmath0o@xmath1 films , which will also affect the magnetic properties of the bilayers .",
    "the detailed structural characterization of fe@xmath0o@xmath1/nio bilayers grown on mgo(001 ) substrates have shown that the quality of the nio / fe@xmath0o@xmath1 interface has a huge impact on the quality of the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 films .",
    "while magnetite grows homogenously and smoothly on nio films with up to 24 nm thickness , the structural quality of the magnetite films gets distinctly worse with higher nio film thickness .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the interface roughness between nio and fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is increasing with increasing nio film thickness .",
    "while the roughness of the 3 nm nio film is rather small , it is rising obviously with increasing nio film thickness . as a result",
    "the structural quality of the magnetite films grown on 30 nm nio films is constantly reduced with increasing magnetite film thickness .",
    "parts of this research were carried out at the light source petra iii at desy , a member of the helmholtz association ( hgf ) .",
    "we would like to thank o. h. seeck for assistance in using beamline p08 .",
    "financial support by the dfg ( ku2321/2 - 1 ) is gratefully acknowledged ."

    "<S> the surface properties as studied by x - ray photo electron spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction show clear evidence of stoichiometric well - ordered film surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> based on the kinematic approach x - ray diffraction experiments were completely analyzed . as a result the nio films grow pseudomorphic in the investigated thickness range ( up to 34 nm ) while the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 films relax continuously up to the thickness of 50 nm . </S>",
    "<S> although all diffraction data show well developed laue fringes pointing to oxide films of very homogeneous thickness , the fe@xmath0o@xmath1-nio interface roughens continuously up to 1 nm root - mean - square roughness with increasing nio film thickness while the fe3o4 surface is very smooth independent on the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the fe@xmath0o@xmath1-nio interface spacing is similar to the interlayer spacing of the oxide films while the nio - mgo interface is expanded . </S>"
