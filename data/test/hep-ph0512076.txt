    "there are growing evidences from various cosmic observations , including type ia supernova ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , large scale structures ( lss ) @xcite , and so on , that support for a spatially flat and accelerating universe at the present epoch . in the context of friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology",
    ", this acceleration is attributed to the so - called dark energy @xcite .",
    "the simplest candidate for the dark energy seems to be a remnant small cosmological constant .",
    "however , many physicists are attracted to the idea that the dark energy is due to a dynamical component in the evolution of the universe , such as the quintessence @xcite , the k - essence @xcite , the phantom @xcite , or the quintom @xcite .",
    "1ex    recently there have been a lot of works",
    "@xcite which study possible connections between neutrinos and the dark energy , generally referred to as the neutrino dark energy .",
    "one of the predictions of the class of models of neutrino dark energy is that neutrino masses are not constant , but can vary as a function of space and time .",
    "this general prediction can be tested with short gamma ray burst @xcite , cmb and lss @xcite , and much more interestingly and directly in neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    "we make a concrete study of the possibility of probing the property of dark energy and differentiating its dynamic origin in very long baseline neutrino oscillations .",
    "1ex    in general for the models of neutrino dark energy , the lagrangian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the lagrangian of the standard model describing the physics of the left - handed neutrinos , @xmath2 is for the dynamical dark energy scalar @xmath3 such as quintessence or phantom , and @xmath4 describes the sector that mediates the interaction between the dark energy scalar and neutrinos , and gives rise to variations of the neutrino masses .",
    "1ex    at energy much below the electroweak scale , the relevant lagrangian for the neutrino dark energy can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kinetic term of neutrinos , @xmath7 is a coefficient which takes the value of @xmath8 for a dirac neutrino and @xmath9 for a majorana neutrino , @xmath10 is the scalar field dependent mass of the @xmath11-th neutrino that characterizes the interaction between the neutrino and the dark energy scalar .",
    "1ex    the authors of @xcite have used the recently released snia data to constrain the coupling of the scalar @xmath3 to neutrinos and the property of the dark energy scalar .",
    "they found that the model with a phantom scalar is mildly favored .",
    "however , the data do not rule out the possibility of the quintessence scalar coupled to neutrinos . in this paper",
    "we will show that these two models predict different spatial variation of neutrino masses inside earth and consequently result in different signals in very long baseline neutrino oscillations .",
    "1ex    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present our mechanism for the neutrino mass variation ; in section iii we study quantitatively the mass - varying effect in the long baseline neutrino oscillations ; section iv is a brief summary .",
    "in the standard model of particle physics , a typical term for the neutrino masses can be described by a lepton violating dimension-5 operator @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a scale of new physics beyond the standard model which generates the @xmath14 violations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the lepton and higgs doublet , respectively . here",
    "we neglect the lepton generation symbol .",
    "when the higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value , @xmath17 , the left - handed neutrino receives a majorana mass @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors proposed a model where the dark energy scalar @xmath3 couples to the dim-5 operator . in this model",
    "neutrino masses vary along with the evolution of the universe and the neutrino mass limit imposed by baryogenesis is modified .",
    "1ex    the dimension-5 operator above is not renormalizable . it can be generated from physics beyond the standard model which involves very heavy particles interacting with standard model particles . at low energies",
    "the heavy particles can be integrated out and thus resulting in effective , nonrenormalizable terms .",
    "for example , in the model of the minimal see - saw mechanism , we have the neutrino mass term , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the majorana mass matrix elements of the right - handed neutrinos and @xmath21 the yukawa couplings .",
    "the dirac masses of the neutrinos are given by @xmath22 .",
    "now integrating out the heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath23 , one will generate a dim-5 operator as stated above . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are various possibilities to have the light neutrino masses varied , such as by coupling the quintessence field to either the dirac masses or the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos , or to both .",
    "1ex    in this paper we consider the case where the variation of the neutrino masses is caused by a coupling of the dark energy scalar @xmath3 to right - handed neutrinos . with the majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos varying",
    ", @xmath20 becomes a function of the dark energy scalar field @xmath3 , @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we assume a linear relationship between the majorana mass and @xmath3 .",
    "then the relevant lagrangian can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 are dimensionless constants and @xmath27 is the potential for @xmath3 .",
    "the upper minus sign in @xmath28 is for the case of quintessence while the lower plus sign for the phantom .",
    "this convention will be used throughout this paper .",
    "now the majorana mass matrix elements of the right - handed neutrinos can be written as @xmath29 and consequently via the seesaw mechanism we obtain the masses of the light neutrinos @xmath30 , @xmath31    similar to the study on the mass varying neutrinos in @xcite , here we introduce also a coupling between @xmath3 and the baryon matter with the effective potential for @xmath3 at low energies given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dimensionless constant @xcite , @xmath34 denotes the energy density of the @xmath35-th matter field , and @xmath36 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the dark energy scalar @xmath3 shall change its value in space @xcite according to the equation of motion @xmath37 in the following we will calculate the evolution of the dark energy field and the corresponding variation of neutrino masses in the earth for both the quintessence and the phantom cases .",
    "1ex    the density profile of baryon in the earth is taken as the widely adopted prem model @xcite , in which earth is taken to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the atmosphere is treated as a homogenous layer of @xmath38 in thickness with a constant density @xmath39 . defining @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 the earth s radius ,",
    "the baryon density can be expressed as @xmath43 with @xmath44 in units of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 in units of km .",
    "we also assume a homogeneous baryon background outside the atmosphere with the density @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the critical energy density of the universe at the present epoch .",
    "1ex    with these assumptions , eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) can be simplified as @xmath49 with the boundary conditions @xmath50 @xmath51 here @xmath52 denotes the interface between the static solution and the cosmological one . for @xmath53 , we expect @xmath3 to become a constant : @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the value of the dark energy scalar field on cosmological scales at the present epoch . for simplicity we take @xmath56 which is consistent with the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ bu ] ) that the baryon background becomes very thin and homogeneous for @xmath57 .",
    "it should be noted that we require @xmath58 to satisfy the equivalence principle constraints @xcite .",
