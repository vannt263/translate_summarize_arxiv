    "is the nonlinearity of the equations of motion of the system , and the existence of discrete breathers has been proved rigorously for some classes of systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to their analogs in continuous systems , the existence of discrete breathers is a generic phenomenon , which accounts for considerable interest in these objects from a physical point of view in the last decade .",
    "in fact , recent experiments could demonstrate the existence of discrete breathers in various real systems such as low - dimensional crystals @xcite , antiferromagnetic materials @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , molecular crystals @xcite , coupled optical waveguides @xcite , and micromechanical cantilever arrays @xcite . for a review on the topic see @xcite .",
    "more than a decade ago , discrete breathers have been observed in numerical simulations of , among others , the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) system  @xcite , a chain of nonlinearly coupled masses .",
    "although existence of db as exact periodic solutions was proved already some years ago for a large class of oscillator networks  @xcite ( not containing the fpu system ) , a proof of their existence in the fpu system has been obtained only recently  @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the concept of db are so - called traveling db , spatially localized solutions which travel along the chain .",
    "at least as approximate solutions they have been observed numerically in the fpu system .",
    "a proof of their existence , however , has not been achieved so far , and in fact it is doubted that traveling db exist as exact solutions in this system .",
    "the theoretical analysis of approximate traveling db is still an open problem which will be tackled in this article .",
    "we consider traveling db as long - living transient structures which can be described by an effective hamiltonian as presented in  @xcite .",
    "we distinguish three types of localized structures , characterized by their degree of localization , which can be found in the fpu dynamics .",
    "examples of these different types are plotted in figure 1 , where from type i to type iii the degree of spatial localization is increasing .",
    "type i is similar to a standing wave .",
    "it is not a proper db , as its localization depends on the system size , but its energy envelope is sort of localized in a finite system .",
    "type ii is exponentially localized , but , as the width of the structure is not that small with respect to the intersite distance , it is called a weakly localized db .",
    "type iii depicts a strongly localized db , similar to those first discovered numerically  @xcite .",
    "all three of these structures are observable in fpu systems as ( transient ) traveling localized objects , called traveling discrete breathers , and we will distinguish in the following between these three types when deriving their effective dynamics .",

    ", width=453 ]    the outline of this article is as follows : section  [ sec : fpu ] provides some basic definitions regarding the fpu model . in section  [ sec : proc ] , the method of the effective hamiltonian is briefly recalled , providing the necessary ingredients for its application .",
    "section  [ sec : waves ] succinctly recalls some results from  @xcite , describing the motion of db of type i. in section  [ sec : weak ] , an effective hamiltonian is constructed for a family of db of type ii , providing a good framework to understand the traveling motion of weakly localized db in fpu chains .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : strong ] , the case of strongly localized db is treated . here , instead of calculating the effective hamiltonian explicitly ,",
    "the so - called peierls - nabarro barrier is computed , which provides already useful information about the moving properties of db of type iii .",
    "let us consider a chain of oscillators whose dynamics is determined by the hamiltonian @xmath0,\\ ] ] with momenta @xmath1 and positions @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 characterize , respectively , the on - site potential and the ( nearest - neighbor ) interaction potential .",
    "the fpu model is defined by the choices @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "note , however , that the theory of the next section applies to a more general class of models .",
    "the method of the effective hamiltonian has been exposed in @xcite in a general framework .",
    "it is briefly recalled here before applying it to the fpu model in the subsequent section .",
    "let us define a traveling db of  ( [ eq : chaingen ] ) as a function of the form @xmath7 where the function @xmath8 is increasing in @xmath9 , and such that @xmath10 .",
    "it is localized in @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xmath12 for some @xmath13 ) and periodic in @xmath14 , @xmath15 . to be slightly more general , one may think of @xmath16 being replaced by a function @xmath17 monotonic in @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a function of small amplitude , periodic with a frequency which is small compared to @xmath21 .",
    "the point is that , in a moving frame with velocity @xmath22 , one sees a discrete breather at rest with frequency @xmath21 .",
    "it is generally believed that solutions of the form  ( [ eq : tdb ] ) do not exist as exact solutions in generic systems , although a proof of this conjecture has been accomplished only for a certain class of systems @xcite .",
    "however , it may be possible to get _ approximate _ traveling db of the form  ( [ eq : tdb ] ) when the following conditions can be met :    1 .",
    "find a two - parameter family of approximate ( non - traveling ) discrete breathers of  ( [ eq : chaingen ] ) of the form @xmath23 where @xmath9 characterizes the amplitude of the db and @xmath24 its  position \" .",
    "typically , for a chain having some translation symmetry , and for fixed @xmath9 , there are two such positions where there is an exact db : a  site - centered \" db with integer @xmath24 , and a",
    " bond - centered \" db with half - integer @xmath24 . by interpolating between these exact solutions ,",
    "approximate db can be constructed for any real @xmath24 .",
    "+ next , consider the family of functions @xmath25 the idea is that there may be a `` doppler effect '' of the traveling db , @xmath26 , which can be described by adding a phase shift @xmath27 to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is called the _ momentum _ of the db .",
    "the point is that ( [ eq : fammdb ] ) still describes approximate db for small enough @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   compute , for each member of the family @xmath30 , the symplectic area @xmath31 with period @xmath32 . in the case",
    "where @xmath33 , like for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : chaingen ] ) , one can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the mean value over one period and @xmath36 is the kinetic energy . this calculation should result in a symplectic area @xmath37 proportional to @xmath9 , or related to @xmath9 by a simple functional relation . if this is not the case , the parametrization in  ( [ eq : fammdb ] )",
    "should be changed , indexing the family in terms of @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that @xmath37 is a proper choice as a parameter is explained in  @xcite . in short ,",
    "this can be justified by stating that @xmath37 is an adiabatic invariant of the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "3 .   compute the symplectic form @xmath39 restricted to the coordinates @xmath40 .",
    "this is achieved by evaluating @xmath41 which should be non - zero for any @xmath42 , and the restricted symplectic form reads @xmath43 .",
    "then , an effective hamiltonian is computed as the mean ( over one period ) of the original hamiltonian along the family of db , @xmath44 and , finally , the dynamics of @xmath42 is given by @xmath45 for small enough @xmath29 , and assuming @xmath46 for @xmath47 ( otherwise shift @xmath48 to have this ) one may expand the effective hamiltonian so that it takes on the form @xmath49 providing that @xmath50 be non - zero and finite .",
    "the latter defines an effective inertia , although @xmath50 may be negative .",
    "in fact , as discussed in  @xcite ( especially in examples of section 6 therein ) , the sign of @xmath50 can be interpreted as the sign of an effective anharmonicity of the breather solutions . the second term in  ( [ eq : heffdb2 ] )",
    "is a periodic function ( of period @xmath51 ) which defines a _ peierls - nabarro potential _ for discrete breathers , as introduced and discussed in  @xcite . in these papers",
    "it is shown that the critical points of @xmath52 correspond to exact discrete breathers of the full model . in the simplest situation",
    "there are two types of critical points associated , respectively , with the stable discrete breathers and the unstable ones .",
    "the difference of @xmath53 at these points , say @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is called the _ peierls - nabarro barrier _",
    "@xmath56 the absolute value in this equation is necessary in case of negative @xmath50 . for @xmath50",
    "positive , the minima are associated with stable db , and the maxima with unstable db , otherwise the stability is just reversed . in any case , the smaller this barrier is , the higher is the mobility of a traveling discrete breather , and the better it is in general described by the effective hamiltonian .    in the next sections we apply this scheme to the analysis of the mobility of various types of localized solutions in the fpu model .",
    "in this section , a particular type of localized solutions is considered , termed type i in the introduction , which have the shape of a standing wave .",
    "they do not constitute proper db , as the localization depends on the system size .",
    "the method of the effective hamiltonian was applied to this type of solutions in  @xcite . here , we summarize these results in order to compare them to those for the proper db solutions obtained in the following sections .    consider an fpu chain with , say , an odd number @xmath57 , @xmath58 , of masses and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there exists , in the linear regime ( @xmath59 ) , a family of standing waves @xmath60 whose envelope is localized in space , as it is a sine function with wavelength equal to twice the chain length ( see figure  [ f1 ] , type i ) . moreover , it is observed numerically that the localization strength is enforced when the nonlinearity is turned on , @xmath61 .",
    "this family ( [ eq : standingw ] ) complies with ( [ eq : famdb ] ) , as it is parametrized by @xmath9 and @xmath24 , while @xmath62 is fixed .",
    "such a wave can be put into slow motion when @xmath63 and @xmath64 are non - zero .    to `` add momentum '' to this standing wave ,",
    "it is convenient not to follow ( [ eq : fammdb ] ) , but rather to consider the expression @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath29 is taken as the momentum parameter conjugate to @xmath24 .",
    "the motivation for favoring this parametrization is related to the structure of the linearized fpu chain and has been explained in  @xcite .    with these settings , the symplectic area  ( [ eq : areadb ] ) can be computed , yielding @xmath67 .",
    "the computation of @xmath68 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : taukq ] ) gives @xmath69 , and so the effective symplectic form corresponding to the coordinates @xmath42 is simply canonical . finally , one computes the averaged hamiltonian ( [ eq : heffdb ] ) , obtaining @xmath70 from which the equations of motion @xmath71 are deduced .",
    "therefore , to this order of approximation , there is no peierls - nabarro barrier , and the motion of a traveling localized wave ( [ eq : standingw ] ) is a slow drift at constant speed @xmath72 .",
    "this result is confirmed by direct numerical simulation of the fpu system in the weakly nonlinear regime , using  ( [ eq : swk ] ) as initial condition and plotting the variable @xmath24 versus time @xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : thetat ] ) .",
    "the prediction of ( [ eq : drift ] ) turns out to be valid for small times @xmath18 .",
    "the discrepancy encountered for larger @xmath18 might be reduced by considering higher order terms in ( [ eq : swheff ] ) .",
    "the first proof of the existence of db in fpu type systems is due to livi , spicci , and mackay @xcite for a diatomic chain of alternating masses @xmath73 and @xmath74 with large mass ratio @xmath75 .",
    "existence of db in monoatomic fpu systems [ as defined in ( [ eq : chaingen ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) ] has been proved only recently , either using a variational approach  @xcite , or elaborating a technique of central manifold reduction  @xcite . the latter existence result obtained by james",
    "will be used as a starting point in order to construct a family of db of the form ( [ eq : famdb ] ) . in his formulation",
    "@xcite , james works with the force variable @xmath76 which is one - to - one related to the displacements @xmath77 , provided that @xmath78 is invertible .",
    "suppose @xmath79 then the main result of  @xcite can be formulated as follows : in the fpu system , for @xmath80 sufficiently small , there exist db of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the landau order symbol , and @xmath83 satisfies the recurrence relation @xmath84 with the condition @xmath85 as @xmath86 .",
    "higher oder terms ( h.o.t . ) have been neglected in ( [ eq : recur ] ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath87 ( with @xmath88 ) must be a homoclinic orbit of the two - dimensional map @xmath89 defined in ( [ eq : recur ] ) . in this map ,",

    "finding the reverse situation , we conclude that the motion of a traveling db in the fpu system is effectively described by the dynamics of a particle with negative effective mass in the peierls - nabarro potential .",
    "the upper bound on the depinning energy we found in the numerical experiment differs from the peierls - nabarro barrier roughly by a factor of two .",
    "a more refined optimization of the momentum distribution employed in the depinning experiment might further improve the match .",
    "effective hamiltonians are constructed for various types of db which can be found in the fpu model .",
    "these types , labelled type i , ii , and iii in figure  [ f1 ] , are characterized by their degree of spatial localization .",
    "type i is not a true discrete breather , as its localization depends on the system size , but it represents a localized wave which can be set into motion .",
    "the peierls - nabarro barrier is found to be zero in first approximation , and the localized wave travels at constant speed .",
    "an explicit estimate shows that this speed is not a group velocity and depends on the system size .",
    "db of type ii are called weakly localized .",
    "they are small in amplitude and can be analytically approximated by employing a recent result by james @xcite , proving existence of db in the fpu system . in this case , the peierls - nabarro barrier is found to exist , but it is negligible , being exponentially small with respect to the db amplitude .",
    "db of type ii are found to travel at a speed approximately equal to the group velocity of the corresponding wave packet , but , in contrast to the wave packet , without dispersion .",
    "this group velocity is much smaller than the sound velocity .",
    "finally , db of type iii are considered , being strongly localized and having an amplitude which is not small .",
    "the well - known page and sievers - takeno modes are of this type , and numerically they have frequently been observed in a traveling state . it should be possible to provide an analytic estimate of their traveling speed by constructing an effective hamiltonian , following the procedure of section  [ sec : proc ] and making use of ansatz  ( [ eq : compdb ] ) , but this is yet to be done .",
    "the important feature which distinguishes db of type iii from those of type ii is that their peierls - nabarro barrier is non - negligible .",
    "this barrier is estimated without explicitly computing the effective hamiltonian , and the estimate is in reasonable agreement with the energy necessary to render a db mobile in a numerical experiment .",
