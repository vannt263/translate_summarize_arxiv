    "the modulation - doped algaas / gaas heterostructure is a materials platform of great importance to the study of nanoscale electronic devices with quantum mechanical functionalities , and their development towards future technologies .",
    "@xcite studies of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) formed in an algaas / gaas heterostructure at temperatures below @xmath0  k have met with great success , both in terms of the novel physics of 2d electrons ,  @xcite and as an underpinning technology for quantum wires ,  @xcite quantum dots ,  @xcite and other ballistic transport devices .",
    "@xcite devices based on two - dimensional hole gases ( 2dhgs ) have received less attention ; this is not from a lack of interesting physics .",
    "the higher effective mass of holes leads to stronger carrier interactions , making 2dhgs of interest for studies of the metal - insulator transition  @xcite and bilayer quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite additionally , the spin-@xmath1 nature of holes , arising from strong spin - orbit interactions , has driven interest in novel phenomena in 2dhgs , such as @xmath2-factor anisotropy  @xcite and anomalous spin - polarization ,  @xcite as well as studies of the @xmath3 plateau in quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) ,  @xcite the quantum dot kondo effect  @xcite and berry s phase in aharonov - bohm rings .  @xcite the reduced hyperfine interaction for holes in gaas  @xcite leads to reduced spin - decoherence time compared to electrons ,  @xcite making gaas hole quantum dots of interest for quantum computing .",
    "@xcite    studies of low - dimensional hole devices are impeded by difficulties in making devices with high electronic stability and low noise / drift under electrostatic gating .",
    "telegraph noise , instability and gate hysteresis were particularly problematic in initial attempts to realize hole qpcs  @xcite using si - doped ( 311)a - oriented 2dhgs .",
    "similar issues were reported for gated 2dhgs in c - doped ( 100 ) algaas / gaas heterostructures .",
    "@xcite numerous explanations have been offered including surface diffusion of ohmic contact metal producing a low mobility layer at or close to the surface ,  @xcite charge transfer to states either at the interfaces or in the semiconductor ,  @xcite carrier trapping in deep acceptor levels or in insulating parallel doping layers ,  @xcite or that metallic gates on p - gaas are ` inherently leaky ' because of a reduced schottky barrier relative to n - gaas .",
    "@xcite firmly establishing the origin of the gate instability / hysteresis will contribute towards the development of improved materials and devices for the study of low - dimensional hole systems .",
    "here we show that gate instability / hysteresis in p - type modulation - doped algaas / gaas heterostructures is caused by a complex interplay between surface - state trapping and gate - induced charge migration within the doping layer .",
    "we focus here on si - doped ( 311)a - oriented heterostructures , but similar physics may occur in c - doped ( 100)-oriented heterostructures also .",
    "we use three different experimental approaches : first , we rule out direct charge leakage between the gate and semiconductor by studying devices where an insulator layer is deposited underneath the gates ; two insulators , al@xmath4o@xmath5 and polyimide , were investigated .",
    "we find that insulating the gates does not eliminate the hysteresis , instead , it makes the hysteresis significantly worse .",
    "a recent study of a qpc featuring hfo@xmath4-insulated gates on a c - doped ( 100 ) algaas / gaas heterostructure  @xcite also shows that hysteresis can remain despite insulating the gates . in our experiment ,",
    "the semiconductor surface / gate interface is the only aspect that is different between the insulated and uninsulated gate devices ; they are on the same heterostructure with the same doping .",
    "the resulting large difference in hysteresis points to surface - states as an important contributing factor .",
    "hence our second approach was to investigate surface effects by studying matched algaas / gaas heterostructures , both with and without an al@xmath4o@xmath5 gate insulator layer , and schottky - gated p - type heterostructures with ( nh@xmath6)@xmath4s@xmath7 surface passivation treatment  @xcite performed prior to gate deposition .",
    "in contrast to hole devices , the addition of the insulator does not induce hysteresis for electron devices but alters the pinch - off voltage .",
    "sulfur passivation does not bring consistent improvement in p - type devices , despite increasing the photoluminescence yield equivalently on ( 100 ) and ( 311 ) surfaces .",
    "@xcite in the one instance where passivation did bring significant improvement , hysteresis was still observed .",
    "this led us to suspect charge migration in the doping layer .",
    "hence our third approach was to investigate dopant effects through variable temperature studies .",
    "in particular , we compare the hysteresis in hole devices to electron devices at elevated temperatures @xmath8  k , where deep donors known as dx centers  @xcite begin to detrap ,  @xcite allowing charge to migrate between si dopant sites .",
    "we observe gate hysteresis in electron devices at @xmath9  k very similar to that in hole devices at @xmath10  k. we also show that the hysteresis can be reduced in hole devices by reducing the thickness of the dopant layer from @xmath11  nm to less than @xmath12  nm ( @xmath13-doped ) .",
    "overall , our results point to competition between surface - state and dopant related processes with different time / energy scales as the cause of the hysteresis , and have wider implications given recent interest in surface charge as a source of scattering  @xcite and dopant charge migration as a source of noise  @xcite in algaas / gaas heterostructures and quantum devices .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  ii briefly addresses materials and methods , with an extended discussion presented in appendix a. in section  iii we focus on gate leakage and discuss hole devices featuring al@xmath4o@xmath5 and polyimide gate insulators .",
    "sections  iv and v concentrate on surface - states and charge migration in the dopant layer , respectively .",
    "finally , in section vi , we draw conclusions based on the overall results and discuss the broader implications of the work for the study of low - dimensional devices in algaas / gaas heterostructures .",
    "appendices b - d contain additional supporting data .",
    "five separate algaas / gaas heterostructures denoted 1-e , 1-h , 2-e , 2-h and 3-h were made for this study ; the first four are ` matched ' electron ( -e ) and hole ( -h ) heterostructures produces by deposition onto side - by - side halves of 2 \" diameter gaas substrate , one ( 100)-oriented and the other ( 311)-oriented . this relies on the orientation - dependent amphoteric nature of si dopants in algaas .",
    "@xcite the first four wafers feature an @xmath11  nm si - doped algaas modulation doping layer separated from the 2dhg/2deg by @xmath14  nm of undoped algaas , the fifth features a si - doping layer separated from the 2dhg/2deg by @xmath15  nm of undoped algaas .",

    "the polyimide insulated gate sample was produced using photo - processable polyimide ( hd microsystems ) deposited after the ohmic contact anneal .",

    "the passivation is performed at @xmath28c and care is taken to minimize air exposure between passivation and gate / interconnect deposition .",
    "electrical measurements at @xmath29  k and @xmath30  k were obtained using a liquid helium dip - station and an oxford instruments heliox @xmath31he cryostat , respectively .",
    "standard two- and four - terminal ac lock - in techniques were used to measure the conducting channel s drain current @xmath32 , typically with a @xmath33v constant voltage excitation at @xmath34  hz applied to the source .",
    "the gate bias @xmath35 was applied using a keithley 2400 source - measure unit enabling continuous measurement of gate leakage current @xmath36 down to @xmath26  pa .",
    "more complete details of heterostructure growth , device fabrication and electrical measurement are given in appendix a.",
    "a common explanation for instability and gate hysteresis in schottky - gated p - type algaas / gaas heterostructures is charge leakage from the metal surface - gate into the heterostructure when the gate is positively biased to deplete the 2dhg .",
    "this often relies on the argument that schottky gates on p - type heterostructures are inherently more leaky than on n - type heterostructures .",
    "@xcite ref .",
    "@xcite suggests this occurs because : ( a ) gaas surface states cause the surface fermi level to be pinned slightly closer to the valence band than the conduction band , making the schottky barrier lower for p - type heterostructures ,  @xcite and ( b ) depletion of the hole gas requires the schottky gates to be forward biased .",
    "the latter argument is incorrect ",
    "depletion is a reverse bias process whether the underlying structure is n - type or p - type ; the bias convention is reversed under an inversion in doping type .",
    "@xcite the former argument requires caution for two reasons .",
    "firstly , in most heterostructures the gaas cap is intrinsic , and the dopants in the heterostructure , whether n- or p - type , are in the algaas layers more than @xmath12  nm beneath the surface .",
    "hence the schottky barrier is the same for either doping type , suppressing any relative difference in gate leakage .",
    "secondly , schottky barrier measurements are usually performed at @xmath20  k , where thermionic emission dominates any leakage current ,  @xcite whereas most quantum devices  @xcite are studied at @xmath37  k , where thermionic emission is quenched due to its exponential temperature dependence .",
    "this should further suppress the leakage current difference between schottky gates on n- and p - type heterostructures .     on a log - axis vs gate bias @xmath35 for a schottky - gated modulation - doped p - type heterostructure . at positive @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath36 remains less than @xmath38  pa up to @xmath39  v , sufficient to achieve pinch - off for all uninsulated gate devices studied . in an n - type heterostructure ,",

    "( b ) channel current @xmath32 vs gate voltage @xmath35 at six different gate sweep rates for device a. the horizontal arrows indicate the direction of travel around the hysteresis loop.,width=302 ]    thus metal gates on p- and n - type heterostructures should behave similarly at low temperature aside from a sign - reversal in bias convention ( forward / reverse ) . to confirm this , fig .",
    "1(a ) shows the gate leakage current @xmath36 versus gate bias @xmath35 for a schottky - gated p - type heterostructure ( this data is presented on a linear @xmath36 axis for comparison in appendix b ) .",
    "the gate begins to pass significant current under forward bias conditions at @xmath41  v. under reverse bias , where 2dhg depletion occurs , the leakage current gradually rises as @xmath35 is made increasingly positive , with @xmath42  pa for the entire range @xmath43  v ; this is sufficient to achieve pinch - off in all of our uninsulated devices .",
    "in contrast , a negative @xmath35 , i.e. , forward bias , produces strong gate leakage at @xmath44  v. the misconception that schottky gates on p - type algaas / gaas heterostructures leak at positive @xmath35 may arise from the knowledge that schottky gates on n - type algaas / gaas heterostructures leak for positive @xmath45  v ( indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "reverse bias leakage for n - type heterostructures usually does not occur until well beyond @xmath46  v , consistent with the reverse bias behavior for the p - type heterostructure in fig .",
    "despite this , schottky gates on n - type algaas / gaas heterostructures leak relatively tiny amounts of charge under normal operation .",
    "@xcite this was demonstrated by pioro - ladrire _ et al _ ,  @xcite using a device consisting of a small quantum dot , isolated from the adjacent 2deg , and coupled to a quantum point contact ( qpc ) charge sensor ( see fig .",
    "7 of ref .",
    "the qpc detects charge leaking from the schottky gates forming the dot , with extremely small leakage currents @xmath47  a observed .",
    "these tiny currents are often associated with charge noise in n - type heterostructures ,  @xcite but are not commonly known to produce strong gate hysteresis in n - type heterostructures to the level seen in p - type devices ; the gates in electron devices are generally very stable ( see section iv - a ) . given this ,",
    "it is not possible using fig .",
    "1(a ) and the earlier discussion alone to definitively rule out gate leakage as a possible cause of gate hysteresis / instability in p - type heterostructures . the ultimate test , insulating the gates from the heterostructure , will be presented in section iii - c ; first we characterize the hysteresis we observe in schottky - gated 2dhgs .",
    "device a has ti / au gates deposited directly on the surface of 1-h .",
    "figure  1(b ) shows the measured drain current @xmath32 versus gate voltage @xmath35 from device a at six @xmath35 sweep rates between @xmath48 and @xmath49  mv / s .",
    "hysteresis occurs for all @xmath35 , but is most prominent for @xmath50  v. note that @xmath32 reflects the channel conductivity , which can vary due to changes in either carrier density or mobility .",
    "hall measurements with a small perpendicular magnetic field applied versus @xmath35 show a qualitatively identical hysteresis to that in fig .",
    "1(b ) , confirming that changes in @xmath32 with @xmath35 are predominantly density related .",
    "the direction of travel around the hysteresis loop ( indicated by horizontal arrows in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) provides important clues about the origin of the hysteresis .",
    "first , it allows the most obvious cause of apparent hysteresis : recording delay in the measurement apparatus ( sweep lag ) to be ruled out .",
    "any delay on the upsweep to positive @xmath35 causes a given depletion to occur at a higher apparent @xmath35 , on the downsweep to @xmath51 , reaccumulation of carriers occurs at a lower apparent @xmath35 .",
    "the net result is a clockwise hysteresis loop  the direction of travel in fig .",
    "1(b ) is clearly counterclockwise .",
    "another key characteristic of sweep lag is that the hysteresis is strongest where the derivative @xmath52 is greatest . in fig .",
    "1(b ) the hysteresis is strongest where @xmath52 is the smallest ( see appendix c ) .",
    "these two observations confirm that the hysteresis is not an instrumental issue ; it instead originates within the device .",
    "the effect of gate leakage depends on where the charge leaks to . in an entirely dc measurement ,",
    "charge leaking directly to the 2dhg would add / subtract from the channel current .",
    "this would modify the @xmath32-@xmath35 characteristics but should not produce hysteresis .",
    "here we measure @xmath32 using an ac lock - in technique ; any gate leakage direct to the 2dhg does not appear in the measured @xmath32 versus @xmath35 unless it is an ac current at the reference frequency .",
    "an alternative is that charge leaks into trap states between the gate and 2dhg ; this will produce hysteresis if the trap time is not very small . because a positive @xmath35 is applied to the gates to deplete the 2dhg",
    ", any charge leaking from the gate will be positive , and its closer proximity to the 2dhg will increase the depletion at a given @xmath35 on the downsweep . similarly , for a 2deg the leaked charge will be negative , and it will also increase depletion ; this is what produces the downward steps in the downsweep arm of the gate characteristics in fig .",
    "7(a ) of ref .",
    "returning our attention to holes , on the upsweep , reaccumulation in the 2dhg will be delayed by the need for the trapped positive charge to dissipate .",
    "this produces a clockwise hysteresis loop for holes , opposite to that in fig .",
    "1(b ) and consistent with our argument in section iii - c below that gate leakage does not cause the hysteresis",
    ". note that gate leakage corresponds to an counterclockwise hysteresis loop for electrons due to the hysteresis loop mirroring about @xmath51 for carrier sign inversion ; this is exactly the loop direction obtained in fig .",
    "7 of ref .",
    "@xcite where gate leakage does cause the hysteresis .",
    "the steps in ref .",
    "@xcite arise from the high sensitivity of their measurement configuration , single / few trap resolution will not be observed in the large area gate devices studied here .",
    "note that the hysteresis loop for the hole qpc in ref .",
    "@xcite is counterclockwise , opposite the direction expected for hysteresis due to gate leakage .",
    "we will present a possible explanation for the counterclockwise loop direction in section iii - d , first , we continue towards ruling out gate leakage as the cause of the hysteresis by looking at insulated - gate devices .     and",
    "( b ) gate leakage current @xmath36 versus gate voltage @xmath35 at three different gate sweep rates for device b ( @xmath21  nm al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer on 1-h ) .",
    "horizontal arrows indicate sweep direction . in ( b )",
    "the left / right axis and lower / upper data are for the up / down sweep , respectively .",
    "once @xmath36 reaches @xmath53a the gate voltage source implements current limiting , holding @xmath35 fixed .",
    "hence for @xmath54  v the data in ( a ) should be considered as @xmath55 versus time @xmath56 at fixed @xmath35 , with each @xmath57  v minor tick in @xmath35 corresponding to @xmath11 , @xmath58 and @xmath21  s for sweep rates of @xmath59 , @xmath12 and @xmath49  mv / s , respectively.,width=302 ]      figure  2(a / b ) shows @xmath32 and @xmath36 versus @xmath35 for device b , with ti / au gates insulated by a @xmath21  nm al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer .",
    "we would expect hysteresis to be heavily suppressed in this device if it is caused by gate leakage .",
    "instead the hysteresis becomes stronger , and we need to drive @xmath35 to al@xmath4o@xmath5 insulator breakdown to even approach pinch - off .",
    "a higher pinch - off voltage is expected ; device b has increased gate-2dhg separation and an extra dielectric layer .",
    "we find a conversion factor @xmath60 relating the insulated and uninsulated gate biases @xmath61 and @xmath35 using a parallel - plate capacitor model , assuming gaas , algaas and al@xmath4o@xmath5 dielectric constants of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(a ) that the shift in pinch - off bias from @xmath65  v to @xmath66  v , i.e. , by a factor of @xmath67 , far exceeds that expected from simply adding @xmath21  nm of al@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "to confirm that device b s large pinch - off voltage is not a fabrication problem , we measured a second device differing only in top - gate pattern / area ( see appendix d ) .",
    "this gave similar behavior , with a large @xmath68  v required to achieve even modest depletion ( @xmath69 reduction in @xmath32 ) .",
    "the features in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(a ) are qualitatively identical , but we highlight two places where the quantitative differences are substantial .",
    "firstly , the current plateau at intermediate @xmath35 is much longer for device b , delaying pinch - off accordingly .",
    "this creates the illusion that the initial drop in @xmath32 in the upsweep is steeper ; the opposite is true with the initial drop in fig .",
    "1(b ) complete by @xmath70  v whereas the same drop in @xmath32 takes @xmath71  v in fig .",
    "secondly , there is a distinct asymmetry in the sweep - rate dependence of upsweeps and downsweeps : the upsweep path depends heavily on sweep - rate while the downsweep path is largely independent of sweep - rate .",
    "this is also evident in fig .",
    "1(b ) , but is heavily exacerbated by the al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer .",
    "the insulator - semiconductor interface can have a radical effect on performance in devices with a shallow conducting channel .",
    "@xcite oxide insulators are particularly troublesome due to high interface trap densities ; improvement is often obtained using polymeric insulators e.g. , polyimide .",
    "@xcite to explore this we studied device c , which features gates insulated with @xmath72  nm of polyimide .",
    "this gave qualitatively similar results to device b ( see appendix d ) .",
    "pinch - off can not be achieved in device c either , largely due to the much lower breakdown voltage @xmath73  v for the polyimide layer . at breakdown , @xmath55 has only fallen by @xmath74 of its @xmath51 value .      a possible explanation for an counterclockwise hysteresis loop and its particular shape in fig .",
    "1(b ) is the gradual population / depopulation of a layer of _ net _ negative charge between the gate and 2dhg ( n.b .",
    ", the charge on the gate is positive , this can not be gate leakage ) .",
    "on the upsweep , the positive @xmath35 places positive charge on the gate , and this ideally results in depletion of the 2dhg ( i.e. , reduced carrier density ) .",
    "but , if adding positive charge to the gate instead results in net negative charge accumulation between gate and 2dhg , then depletion stalls , producing a reduced transconductance @xmath75 and perhaps even an @xmath32 plateau",
    ". the link between a plateau in @xmath32 versus @xmath35 and stalling of 2dhg depletion was confirmed by a corresponding plateau in hall measurements of the 2dhg . if the capacity for net negative charge accumulation is finite , depletion eventually resumes , leading to pinch - off ( @xmath76 ) . on the downsweep",
    ", positive charge is gradually removed from the gate , leading to 2dhg repopulation and loss of the accumulated net negative charge .",
    "if the net negative charge is held in deep trapping sites , its loss may be very slow .",
    "repopulation of the 2dhg will occur first , producing a rapid rise in @xmath32 to a level close to its initial value at @xmath51 , followed by a long current plateau extending to @xmath51 as the net negative charge is lost .",
    "an immediately obvious mechanism is charge trapping by surface states ; it is well - known in both oxide - insulated iii - v fets  @xcite and organic semiconductor fets .",
    "@xcite another possible mechanism is charge migration in the modulation - doping layer . here",
    "the use of ` net ' charge accumulation is deliberate and important .",
    "silicon donors in the al@xmath7ga@xmath77as modulation doping layer of an n - type heterostructure can take two different configurations : a shallow hydrogenic donor occupying a ga site , or for @xmath78 , a metastable donor where the si atom is displaced into an interstitial position along the @xmath79 direction by lattice distortion .",
    "@xcite the dx centers act as deep traps ; when the device is cooled below @xmath80  k , the dx centers capture free electrons in the doping layer to become dx@xmath81 , locking some fraction of the remaining hydrogenic donors in a positive charge state .",
    "this ` freezing ' dopant layer charge is vital to the stability and reproducibility of the electronic properties of devices based on si - doped n - type algaas / gaas heterostructures at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite comparatively little is known about the defect physics of si dopants in ( 311)-oriented p - type algaas / gaas heterostructures .",
    "in addition to acting as a simple substitutional acceptor by occupying an as site , si has also been suggested to form an acceptor complex / deep trap known as si - x .",
    "@xcite initial studies  @xcite suggested that si - x consisted of a si@xmath82 acceptor adjacent to a ga site vacancy v@xmath83 ( subscript denotes site occupied ) .",
    "raman and ir spectroscopy regarding the existence of si - x in heavily si - doped ( 311)a gaas layers is controversial , with data suggesting that it does  @xcite and does not  @xcite exist .",
    "further work , suggested modified structures for si - x , first as a v@xmath83-si@xmath82-as@xmath83 complex ,  @xcite later ruled out in favor of a perturbed si@xmath83-v@xmath83 center .",
    "@xcite these studies were all for gaas ; the existence and properties of si - x - like complexes in al@xmath84ga@xmath85as is unknown .",
    "we comment further on possibilities for si acceptor complexes and deep traps in section vi .    returning to hysteresis mechanisms ,",
    "if the dopant layer traps are shallow or thermal energy is sufficient for a high detrapping rate , charge can migrate in response to the balance of charge between the gate and 2dhg .",
    "for example , when @xmath51 it is energetically more favorable for the 2dhg side of the doping layer to be net negative and the gate side net positive . at pinch - off , the positively charged gate and depleted 2dhg favour the opposite ( 2dhg side net positive / gate side net negative ) .",
    "this gate - induced ` tidal flow ' of doping layer charge is equivalent to negative charge accumulation between gate and 2dhg towards generating an counterclockwise hysteresis loop , as demonstrated in section v.",
    "to better understand the comparative behavior of devices a and b , we prepared devices d and e on 1-e : device d has no al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer , device e has a @xmath21  nm al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer grown simultaneously with that in device b. figures  3(a / b ) present the electrical characteristics for devices d and e. in each case the apparent hysteresis is minimal and the loop direction is consistent with sweep lag ( n.b . ,",
    "reflection of gate characteristics about @xmath51 due to sign - inversion reverses loop direction  for electrons sweep lag goes counterclockwise ) . on its own ,",
    "the lack of device - induced hysteresis in devices d and e does not allow us to pinpoint the origin of the hysteresis solely to surface - states or charge migration , as the shift from 1-h to 1-e entails a change in both the surface orientation and the dopant physics . while the ( 100 ) gaas surface consists only of double - dangling bonds , the ( 311 ) surface contains equal densities of single- and double - dangling bonds .",

    "the purple dot - dashed lines are guides to the eye highlighting the low - bias non - linearity.,width=302 ]    figure  3 has two notable features : the first is pinch - off bias , which increases from @xmath86  v to @xmath87  v upon addition of the al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer .",
    "this @xmath88 increase in pinch - off bias is less than the @xmath89 found for holes , but more than double the @xmath90 expected from a parallel - plate capacitor model .",

    "3(b ) looks different to that in fig .",
    "2(a ) , in both cases it represents a reduced depletion rate for a given change in gate bias , and may have similar origin . a comparison of figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) suggests the low - bias non - linearity arises from the al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer ; we believe it is caused by competition between the filling of surface states and 2deg depletion .",

    "the @xmath94 difference between the actual value of @xmath92  v for device e and the expected value of @xmath95  v is well explained by the @xmath94 difference in measured @xmath51 carrier density between devices d and e. the findings above suggest that most 2deg depletion occurs in the linear region in fig .",

    "@xcite a final point of note is that the data in fig .",
    "3(a ) is not linear all the way to @xmath51 .",

    "our work focussed on the investigation of devices with insulated / uninsulated gates on custom - grown , matched electron and hole heterostructures .",

    "@xcite despite the strong hysteresis in p - type devices at @xmath37  k , we observe no hysteresis in n - type devices until the temperature exceeds @xmath106  k , where the si dx centers in the n - type heterostructure begin to detrap and migration of charge within the doping layer occurs .",
    "@xcite the hysteresis that emerges at @xmath143  k for electrons bears a strong resemblance to that in holes at lower temperatures , particularly at @xmath110  k , where the current plateau at intermediate @xmath35 drops to @xmath144 and is quenched .",
    "this correspondence , and the lack of hysteresis for electrons at @xmath145  k , strongly suggests that surface states are not the sole cause of the hysteresis ; migration of charge in the dopant layer is likely involved as well .",
    "we return to surface states following a discussion of dopants .    comparatively little",

    "although si clearly acts as a substitutional acceptor , the presence and properties of acceptor complexes such as si - x is debated .",
    "@xcite our data can not provide insight at the atomic level , but there are clearly no acceptor sites in a p - type heterostructure s doping layer that act like the deep - trapping dx centers in n - type heterostructures . regarding si - x specifically , we can draw two conclusions : if si - x exists in al@xmath84ga@xmath85as in ( 311)a heterostructures , then it must be a very shallow trap ( more than 100 times shallower than dx ) if present at high density , and only a deep - trap if it is present at such low density that it can not ` freeze ' the doping layer s charge configuration . while the lack of dx - like deep traps answers the obvious question of why p - type heterostructures are so unstable / hysteretic under gating",
    ", it is interesting to invert the thinking and consider instead why n - type heterostructures are often so impressively stable .",
    "the answer is clear  the deep - trapping dx centers ` lock down ' the vast majority of free charge in the dopant layer  but inspirational : one way to stabilize modulation - doped p - type heterostructures may be to deliberately poison the modulation doping layer with deep trapping sites , perhaps by engineering the growth conditions to obtain a high density of deep - trapping si acceptor complexes , or failing that , by co - doping with transition metal impurities , e.g. , cu , fe , ni or zn .",
    "@xcite cu is probably more optimal than fe or ni , which may bring magnetic side - effects , and zn , which is a rapid diffuser in gaas and may be incompatible with ohmic contact formation .",
    "the changes in hysteresis obtained by changing insulator composition or surface passivation are small compared to the differences arising between the presence / absence of a gate insulator .",
    "one possible explanation is that the metal / gaas interface quenches the surface - state density , either chemically by forming ti - o - ga or ti - o - as bonds ( or ti - s - ga or ti - s - as bonds ) , or physically by providing a nearby high electron density that partially screens the surface states .",
    "@xcite this is in the same spirit as the addition of a doping layer to compensate the surface - states in ultra - high mobility n - type algaas / gaas heterostructures .",
    "@xcite this idea could be applied here with the lightly - doped cap in 3-h replaced by adding a uniformly doped layer between the cap and modulation - doping for surface - state compensation .",
    "another alternative is to abandon schottky - gates and use a degenerately - doped cap as a semiconductor gate .",
    "@xcite this effectively places the gate underneath the semiconductor surface , enabling the gate to screen the 2dhg from the surface - states . indeed , this explains the high stability and lack of hysteresis in undoped p - type semiconductor - insulator - semiconductor field - effect transistor ( sisfet ) devices .",
    "@xcite there both hysteresis contributions are dealt with  the modulation doping is removed and the gate screens the surface - states .",
    "given the success of undoped sisfets , one might ask : why bother making semiconductor - gated modulation - doped devices ?",
    "in undoped sisfets it is essential that the gate overlaps the ohmic contacts ; this makes fabrication more difficult and lowers yield .",

    "the slope curves for the down sweeps are very similar to those in fig .",
    "9 except there is less structure at low @xmath35 and the peak at higher @xmath35 is sharper and shifted to more positive @xmath35 .",
    "if the hysteresis is caused by sweep lag , one would expect the maximum vertical extent in the hysteresis to coincide in @xmath35 with the maximum slope @xmath178 .",

    "the gate in device b2 covers less area . in both cases the gate does not extend to the edges of the al@xmath4o@xmath5 layer ; hence in neither case is leakage by proximal direct shorting between gate and ohmic contact .",
    "the characteristics are very similar to those in device b , and the breakdown voltage is of a similar magnitude @xmath181  v. repeated sweeps appear to increase the breakdown voltage , enabling the device to slowly progress towards pinch - off .",

    "@xcite due to high interface - state densities , inorganic oxide insulators are particularly troublesome , causing significant hysteresis and shifts in threshold voltage .",
    "polymeric insulators such as polyimide often bring significant improvement . to explore whether the current plateau and difficulty in attaining pinch - off in device b is tied to insulator composition we studied device c containing gates insulated with a @xmath72  nm thick polyimide layer on 2-h .",

    "on the upsweep there is an initial drop in current that plateaus for intermediate @xmath35 , followed by a recovery in @xmath55 when @xmath35 is held constant .",
