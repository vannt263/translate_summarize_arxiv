    "a killing horizon is a null hypersurface whose null generators are flow lines of a killing field . at each point of a killing horizon , a scalar quantity called the surface gravity is defined .",
    "its usual definition refers only to the properties of the killing vector ( and the metric )  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to indicate how it can be defined instead as the rate of expansion of space in the direction of the killing frame as viewed by freely falling observers crossing the horizon .",
    "this is analogous to cosmological expansion , but it involves only one spatial direction , and no preferred observer is selected .",
    "any freely falling observer with unit killing energy will determine the same expansion at the horizon , which is equal to the surface gravity .",
    "this investigation was initially motivated by the expression for surface gravity in painlev - gullstrand type coordinates .",
    "consider for example the two dimensional line element [ pg ] ds^2 = dt^2 - ( dx - v(x)dt)^2 , which has a killing vector @xmath2 and a killing horizon where @xmath3 .",
    "the surface gravity turns out to be given by the gradient @xmath4 evaluated at the horizon .",
    "this may be interpreted as the fractional rate of expansion of the flow defined by the geodesics satisfying @xmath5 , in the following sense .",
    "these geodesics are orthogonal to the constant @xmath6 lines , on which @xmath7 measures proper length .",
    "the proper distance @xmath8 between neighboring geodesics therefore satisfies @xmath9 . since the proper time along these geodesics is just @xmath10 , this is the fractional rate of change with respect to proper time .",
    "here we formulate what amounts to a covariant version of this relation between surface gravity and two - dimensional expansion , and we demonstrate its universal applicability to any killing horizon in any spacetime dimension , with the observer moving in any direction .    aside from the geometric perspective it offers , another motivation for this note is that the 2d expansion field , defined both on and off the horizon , may turn out to be physically relevant in settings where a local preferred frame is present .",
    "condensed matter black hole analogs  @xcite , theories with a dynamical  aether \"  @xcite , and lorentz violating dispersion  @xcite or dissipation  @xcite are examples of such settings .",
    "there are several ways to define the surface gravity @xmath11 using only the killing vector @xmath12 and the metric . for the present purposes ,",
    "the most convenient is via the relation [ kappa ] _",
    "a^2 = -2 _ a , evaluated at the horizon .",
    "the gradient of @xmath13 is normal to the horizon , since this function is constant ( equal to zero ) on the horizon .",
    "the killing vector is also normal to the horizon , since it lies along the null tangent direction which is always the normal direction to a null hypersurface .",
    "these vectors are therefore parallel , so @xmath14 is well - defined by ( [ kappa ] ) .",
    "note however that the value of @xmath14 depends on the normalization of the killing vector , which is not determined by the symmetry alone .",
    "typically the norm is fixed to be unity on the worldline of some killing observer , for example at infinity for an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime .",
    "we can use ( [ kappa ] ) to find the surface gravity for the metric ( [ pg ] ) with respect to the killing vector @xmath15 .",
    "( in this example the killing vector has unit norm where @xmath16 . )",
    "the @xmath17 component of ( [ kappa ] ) yields @xmath18 .",
    "the expansion of a congruence of curves is defined by the divergence @xmath19 of the unit tangent vector field @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the covariant derivative operator . here",
    "we will apply this notion to two - dimensional timelike congruences in a spacetime of any dimension .",
    "the 2d surface generated by such a congruence has an induced metric and induced covariant derivative operator @xmath22 , obtained from @xmath23 by restricting the derivative to directions in the surface and projecting the levi - civita connection onto the surface . in terms of the surface projector @xmath24",
    ", the 2d expansion is given by [ theta2d ] _",
    "2d d_a u^a = h^a_b _ a u^b .",
    "the 2d congruences of interest here are composed of timelike geodesics and are invariant under the flow of a killing vector @xmath12 . a timelike vector @xmath20 at a single point @xmath25 uniquely determines such a congruence , namely , the geodesic through @xmath25 with tangent @xmath20 , together with the image of this geodesic along the killing flow . the lie derivative @xmath26 $ ] of the resulting 2d @xmath20 field vanishes by construction .",
    "thus the derivatives of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are related by [ lie ] ^a _ a u^b = u^a_a ^b .",
    "note that the congruence defined in this way , given @xmath20 at a single point , is independent of the normalization of the killing vector .",
    "the tangent plane to the 2d congruence at each point is spanned by @xmath20 and an orthogonal , unit spacelike vector @xmath29 in terms of which the orthogonal projector is simply given by [ projectorus ] h^a_b = u^au_b - s^a s_b.expressing @xmath29 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath12 as [ s ] s^a = ( s)^-1((u ) u^a - ^a ) , and inserting ( [ projectorus ] ) into the expression ( [ theta2d ] ) , the terms involving contractions with @xmath27 vanish either because of the geodesic equation or because of the normalization of @xmath27 , leaving just [ theta2dchi ] _ 2d = -(s)^-2 _ b ^a_a u^b . using the lie dragging condition ( [ lie ] ) , and",
    "@xmath30 , ( [ theta2dchi ] ) becomes [ du ] _",
    "this expression for the expansion holds for the 2d geodesic killing congruence generated by any unit timelike vector .",
    "it is independent of the overall scale of the killing vector , and its value generally depends on the direction of the unit vector .",
    "it is worth noting that the 2d expansion is also equal to the spatial derivative of the velocity relative to the killing frame , generalizing the coordinate expression @xmath4 for the expansion of the flow in ( [ pg ] ) . indeed , using the decomposition [ v ] ^a = ( u)(u^a - v s^a ) , where @xmath31 is the velocity of @xmath20 relative to the killing frame , ( [ theta2d ] ) becomes [ s.v ] _ 2d & = & - s^a s_b _ a u^b + & = & - s^a s_b _ a((u)^-1^b + v s^b ) + & = & s^a_a v. ( when @xmath20 is chosen tangent to the free fall trajectory @xmath32 in the coordinate system of ( [ pg ] ) , @xmath33 in ( [ v ] ) coincides with @xmath34 , and the final expression in ( [ s.v ] ) reads @xmath4 . ) in the last step we used ( i ) the fact that the derivative of @xmath35 along @xmath29 vanishes ( since it is constant along each geodesic and along the killing flow ) , ( ii ) killing s equation @xmath36 , and ( iii ) @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , using ( [ v ] ) and the killing symmetry @xmath38 , this result may be expressed in terms of the fractional rate of change of @xmath33 respect to proper time , _ 2d = u^a_a v.",
    "on the horizon , @xmath13 in the denominator of ( [ du ] ) vanishes , hence [ 2dthetahor1 ] _",
    "2d^hor = - . using ( [ kappa ] ) this yields [ kappatheta ] = ( u ) _ 2d^hor .",
    "the 2d expansion on the horizon is thus equal to the surface gravity , provided that @xmath12 is normalized such that @xmath20 has unit killing energy , i.e.   @xmath39 .",
    "it is curious that all dependence on @xmath20 except for the killing energy drops out of the 2d expansion when evaluated on the horizon .",
    "if a normalization of the killing vector is fixed , then at each point of the horizon there is a ( @xmath40)-parameter family of unit timelike @xmath20 with unit killing energy , @xmath41 being the dimension of space - time .",
    "for all of the corresponding observers the 2d expansion is equal to the surface gravity .",
    "alternatively , for _ any _ observer , if the killing field is normalized so the observer has unit killing energy , the surface gravity is equal to the 2d expansion .",
    "we now illustrate the central result of this note with four examples .",
    "first , for an asymptotically flat rotating black hole in four dimensions , the horizon - generating killing vector is @xmath42 , where @xmath2 is the time - translation and @xmath43 is the axial rotation .",
    "if @xmath2 is normalized to unity at spatial infinity as usual , then geodesics that fall from rest at infinity with zero angular momentum have @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so they have unit killing energy , @xmath39 .",
    "when they fall across the horizon such observers measure a 2d expansion that is precisely the surface gravity of @xmath28 . but these are not the only observers with unit killing energy . at each point",
    "there is a two - parameter family of such observers , all of whom measure the same 2d expansion at the horizon for their associated geodesic killing congruence .",
    "the 4-velocities of these observers are related to each other by lorentz transformations ( in the tangent space ) that leave the killing vector fixed .",
    "on the horizon these are null rotations , while outside they are spatial rotations or boosts , depending on whether @xmath28 is timelike or spacelike .",
    "our second example is the rindler horizon in 2d minkowski spacetime , generated by the boost killing vector @xmath46 , where @xmath6 and @xmath17 are minkowski coordinates .",
    "let us consider the geodesic killing congruence determined by the unit timelike vector @xmath47 located at the point @xmath48 .",
    "the fiducial geodesic through this point with this tangent vector is a straight line in the @xmath6 direction , while the geodesics obtained by dragging along the killing flow are straight lines tangent at the other points along the hyperbola @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ ff ] ) .",
    "geodesic congruence in minkowski spacetime invariant under a boost killing flow .",
    "the killing ( rindler ) horizon is the pair of perpendicular lines .",
    "the geodesic segments are straight lines launched tangent to a hyperbola .",
    "the expansion of the congruence at horizon crossing is the reciprocal of the proper distance from the hyperbola to the bifurcation point ( where the horizon lines cross ) ; it is also equal to the surface gravity divided by the killing energy of the geodesics.,width=166 ]    for this congruence we have @xmath50 , which at the horizon - crossing point @xmath51 evaluates to @xmath52 .",
    "the killing energy of this congruence is given by @xmath53 , so according to ( [ kappatheta ] ) the surface gravity is then @xmath54 , as can of course also be verified directly from ( [ kappa ] ) using just the killing vector .",
    "this is dimensionless , since the killing vector normalized as above has dimensions of length . if we instead normalize the killing vector as @xmath55 , so that it is dimensionless and @xmath27 has unit killing energy , then the surface gravity is equal to the 2d expansion at the horizon , @xmath56",
    "for the third example , we use the concept of the 2d expansion to illuminate the sense in which a rindler horizon with non - zero surface gravity is an @xmath57 limit of schwarzschild black hole horizons .",
    "a black hole of mass @xmath58 has a surface gravity @xmath59 with respect to the killing vector normalized to unity at spatial infinity .",
    "if we simply take the limit of this quantity as the mass is increased , holding fixed the norm of the killing field at infinity , the surface gravity goes to zero .",
    "equivalently , the 2d expansion @xmath60 measured by free fall observers dropped from rest at infinity goes to zero in this limit . to approach the rindler limit with a non - zero 2d expansion",
    ", we can instead drop the free fall observers from a fixed proper distance @xmath61 above the horizon , measured on a spatial slice orthogonal to the killing vector . according to ( [ kappatheta ] )",
    "this yields @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the radial coordinate corresponding to the proper distance @xmath61 .",
    "if the killing vector is normalized at the drop point , these observers have unit killing energy and therefore @xmath60 is equal to the surface gravity .",
    "if @xmath58 is much larger than @xmath61 , one finds @xmath64 . in the infinite mass limit",
    "@xmath60 thus tends to @xmath65 .",
    "this is precisely the result , discussed in the previous example , for the case when the observers are  dropped \" from a proper distance @xmath61 above a rindler horizon .    as a final example",
    ", we consider the 2d - expansion in a region where the killing vector is spacelike . in that case",
    "the timelike geodesics can be chosen orthogonal to the killing vector , @xmath66 , so the local expansion ( [ du ] ) takes the form [ h ] _ 2d = u^a_a|| , where @xmath67 is the norm of the killing vector .",
    "since neighboring geodesics in the congruence are connected by a fixed killing parameter , they are separated by a proper distance @xmath68 proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the expansion is also equal to @xmath70 , which is the fractional rate of expansion in the killing direction . in a homogeneous , isotropic cosmological metric",
    "this 2d expansion is nothing but the hubble constant , provided @xmath20 is orthogonal to all of the spatial killing vectors . in the presence of anisotropy",
    "this yields the different expansion rates along the different killing directions .",
    "the construction can even be applied to the killing vector @xmath15 in the ergoregion of the kerr metric , where it yields a local notion of 2d killing expansion , given a choice of @xmath20 .",
