    "knowledge of @xmath1 allows one to predict the mean - field energy of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "manipulating @xmath1 via a fano - feshbach resonance provides interaction control  @xcite , which can increase evaporation efficiency for bec production  @xcite or provide access to strongly interacting gases and gases that emulate interesting many - body hamiltonians  @xcite .    given the importance of the @xmath0-wave scattering length , it is desirable to know its value for the highly magnetic and heavy open - shell lanthanide atom dysprosium ( dy ) , whose three high - abundance bosonic isotopes have recently been bose - condensed  @xcite . however , dy has a highly complex electronic structure : an open @xmath10-shell submerged beneath closed outer @xmath0-shells .",

    "the complexity of dy s electronic structure  possessing 153 born - oppenheimer molecular potentials , electrostatic anisotropy , and a large dipole moment ( @xmath15 bohr  magnetons  @xcite)renders calculating collisional parameters challenging  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as with all but the lightest atoms , determination of the scattering length must rely on experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "one well - known technique often used to probe the collisional properties of ultracold atoms is the cross - dimensional relaxation method  @xcite .",
    "such experiments usually begin with a cloud of atoms in thermal equilibrium .",
    "then extra energy is suddenly added to the cloud along one of the trap axes to create an energy imbalance .",
    "this may be accomplished by diabatically increasing the trap frequency in that direction .",
    "one can then extract the elastic cross section of the colliding particles by measuring the rate at which this energy redistributes among all three trap axes .    for bosonic alkali atoms ,",
    "whose collision interaction is dominated by @xmath0-wave scattering at ultracold temperatures , i.e. , below the @xmath16-wave centrifugal energy barrier , the elastic cross section is directly related to the scattering length  @xcite . however , the scattering in ultracold bosonic dy gases is strongly affected by the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) .",
    "in contrast to the short - ranged , isotropic van der waals interaction , the ddi is long - ranged and highly anisotropic : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vacuum permeability , * r * is the relative position of the dipoles , and @xmath19 is the angle between @xmath20 and the dipole polarization direction .",
    "scattering due to the ddi has been calculated to be universal in the ultracold regime , meaning that it does not depend on the microscopic details of the colliding particles  @xcite .",
    "such scattering can be characterized by a single parameter , the dipole length scale @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the single - particle mass  @xcite .",
    "the universal nature of the ddi has been observed for both elastic  @xcite and inelastic collisions  @xcite .",
    "the remaining non - universal part of scattering resides in the scattering length , whose value varies from atom to atom .",
    "the goal of this work is to measure @xmath1 , which includes the small dipolar contribution [ 2 ] , by accounting for the ddi in the total dy - dy elastic cross section .",
    "this is achieved by comparing the measured cross - dimensional relaxation of an ultracold gas of dy to numerical simulations in which the ddi s contribution to the cross section is well understood  @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold dipolar gases in realistic experimental situations is made possible by a recently developed direct - simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method that solves the boltzmann equation with the full dipolar differential scattering cross section  @xcite .",
    "this numerical method has proven successful in describing the rethermalization of a cloud of fermionic erbium atoms driven out of equilibrium  @xcite . here",
    "we apply these simulation tools to bosonic @xmath3dy and @xmath5dy undergoing cross - dimensional relaxation and extract the deca - heptuplet @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 for both isotopes in their maximally stretched ground state @xmath23 .",
    "preparation of ultracold dy gases is discussed in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "dysprosium atoms in an atomic beam generated by a high - temperature effusive cell are loaded into a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) via a zeeman slower , both operating at 421  nm . for further cooling ,",
    "the atoms are loaded into a blue - detuned , narrow - linewidth mot at 741  nm .",
    "we typically achieve trap populations of @xmath24 @xmath3dy or @xmath5dy atoms at @xmath25  @xmath7k .",
    "the atoms confined within this narrow - line , blue - detuned mot are spin - polarized in @xmath26 .",
    "they are subsequently loaded into a single - beam 1064-nm optical dipole trap ( odt ) .",
    "once in the odt , the atoms are transferred to the absolute electronic ground state @xmath23 by radio - frequency - induced adiabatic rapid passage .",
    "we then perform forced evaporative cooling in two differently optimized crossed optical dipole traps ( codt ) formed by three 1064-nm beams .",
    "the first codt is very tight for efficient initial evaporation , and the second codt is larger to avoid inelastic three - body collisions .",
    "the final trap consists of two beams crossed in the horizontal and the vertical directions .",
    "the horizontal beam is elliptical with a horizontal waist of @xmath27 and a vertical waist of @xmath28 .",
    "the vertical beam has a circular waist of @xmath29 .",
    "these beam profiles are chosen so that the trap is oblate , with the tight axis along gravity @xmath30 , to avoid trap instabilities due to the ddi  @xcite . throughout the evaporation ,",
    "the atomic dipoles are aligned along @xmath31 by a constant vertical magnetic field @xmath32  g. we verified for both isotopes that there are no fano - feshbach resonances within a range of 100  mg centered at this field  @xcite .",
    "this ensures that our measurement of @xmath1 corresponds to the background value .",
    "the aforementioned codt configurations are optimized for bec production .",
    "we utilize the same traps in this work , but do not evaporatively cool the gas quite to degeneracy . in this thermal but ultracold temperature regime ,",
    "the collisional dynamics of dipolar particles can be modeled by the boltzmann equation .",
    "we apply the same evaporative cooling sequence for @xmath3dy and @xmath5dy , and we obtain @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) atoms for @xmath3dy ( @xmath5dy ) , both at 550(10 )  nk and @xmath35 .    to prepare for the cross - dimensional relaxation experiment , we first raise the trap depth by adiabatically ramping up the power of both beams by a factor of 2 in 0.2  s to 1.2(1 )  w for the horizontal beam and 1.9(1 )  w for the vertical .",
    "a tighter , deeper trap prevents evaporation after the cloud is compressed , and the new trap frequencies are [ @xmath36 = @xmath37[151(2 ) , 70(5 ) , 393(1 ) ]  hz .",
    "we then rotate the magnetic field in the @xmath38-@xmath31 plane to the desired angle @xmath39 , where @xmath39 is the angle between the field orientation and @xmath31 .",
    "we ensure that the magnitude of the field remains unchanged after the rotation to within 10  mg of the initial value through rf - spectroscopy measurements of zeeman level splittings .",
    "we repeat the experiment at three different angles @xmath40 $ ] , as the dipole alignment angle should affect the thermalization time scale . a valid theory that accounts for",
    "both the anisotropic ddi and the @xmath0-wave interaction should extract consistent scattering lengths from measurements made at different @xmath39 .",
    "the last preparatory step involves uniformly increasing the temperature of the cloud to prevent dipolar mean - field interaction energy from affecting time - of - flight ( tof ) thermometry .",
    "while the contact interaction is negligible above @xmath41 , the ddi energy requires accurate modeling .",
    "we find that even a thermal cloud of dy in equilibrium expands anisotropically near degeneracy , indicating that the ddi affects tof expansion .",
    "however , we observe isotropic expansion after heating the cloud to about 1.2 @xmath7k .",
    "we parametrically heat the cloud by modulating the power of the horizontal odt for 0.4  s at 400  hz , nearly resonant with @xmath42 . after the heating , we hold the cloud for 0.4 s to ensure thermal equilibrium , which we verify by observing isotropic expansion at 20  ms tof .",
    "this sets the initial state of the cross - dimensional relaxation experiment with a peak atomic density of @xmath43  @xmath44 and @xmath45 for both @xmath3dy and @xmath5dy at @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath3dy densities at @xmath47 and @xmath48 are lowered by 5% and 16% , respectively . for @xmath5dy ,",
    "we observe no decrease in density at @xmath47 but a 27% decrease at @xmath48 .",
    "these losses are likely due to fano - feshbach resonances encountered during the magnetic field rotation  @xcite .",
    "to drive the cloud out of equilibrium , we increase the power of the vertical odt by a factor of 2 with a 1-ms linear ramp .",
    "the resulting trap frequencies are [ @xmath36 = @xmath37[175(3 ) , 103(5 ) , 393(1 ) ]  hz",
    ". the induced change in the trapping potential can be considered diabatic since the ramp time is much shorter than the trap oscillation periods in the two directions , @xmath49 and @xmath38 , that are primarily affected by the vertical beam . during the compression process",
    ", the majority of the energy is added to the most weakly confined direction @xmath38 , which is along the imaging beam .",
    "the trap frequency along @xmath49 is also slightly increased by the vertical beam .",
    "the extra energy then redistributes among all three dimensions as the atoms undergo elastic collisions in the trap , and we record the rethermalization process by measuring @xmath50 and @xmath51 after holding the cloud for variable durations  @xcite . to extract the @xmath0-wave scattering length , we compare the measured rethermalization dynamics to the numerical simulations described in the next section .",
    "in non - dipolar ( or sufficiently weak dipolar ) bose gases , the scattering length is simply related to the rethermalization time - constant by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the averaged atom number density , @xmath54 is the elastic collision cross section , @xmath55 is the averaged relative velocity , and @xmath56 is the mean number of collisions per particle required for rethermalization  @xcite . in a strongly dipolar gas , a more complicated relationship exists between the rethermalization time constant and the scattering length because @xmath56 becomes a function of polarization .    to simulate our experiments ,",
    "we solve the boltzmann equation using the dsmc algorithm outlined in ref .",
    "the goal of the computation is to simulate the nonequilibrium dynamics of dy gas with the single free parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we expect the results of the dsmc algorithm to be quantitatively accurate at temperatures well above quantum degeneracy , but below the wigner threshold , which for bosonic dy corresponds to the @xmath16-wave centrifugal barrier @xmath57250 @xmath58  @xcite .    to briefly summarize , the simulation uses @xmath59 test - particles that undergo classical time dynamics within the trapping potential , where the @xmath60-th test - particle has a phase - space coordinate @xmath61 .",

    "this computational procedure is capable of including the complete details of the dynamic trapping potentials relevant to the experiment .",

    "alternatively , one could define temperatures from the spatial distribution rather than the momentum space , but since the experiment measures tof expansion images , we focus on the momentum space images to enable direct comparison between theory and experiment .",

    "we believe the temperature oscillations evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : datasimulation_rawcomparison ] arise from collective modes excited by the diabatic trap compression .",
    "these oscillations are unusual in cross - dimensional rethermalization experiments , and they are due to the fact that the dysprosium gas , being highly magnetic , lies closer to the hydrodynamic collisional regime than ultracold gases of less magnetic atoms .",
    "that is , elastic collisions occur far more frequently than in weakly dipolar gases due to the presence of both @xmath0-wave and dipolar contributions to the elastic cross section , where the dipolar contribution is @xmath74 and @xmath75  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "our simulations show that the oscillations arise from the ddi : the oscillations vanish  and the rethermalization time increases  as the dipolar length is artificially decreased at fixed trap frequency .",
    "the criteria for the hydrodynamic regime is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mean - free - path , @xmath78 is the total elastic collision cross section , and @xmath79 is the characteristic size of the gas along the weakest trap axis  @xcite . before compression , @xmath80 , indicating that the collision and trapping frequencies are comparable for this highly magnetic gas . indeed , the oscillation frequency of @xmath50 is similar to that of @xmath81 , while the oscillation of @xmath51 is similar to @xmath82 , the most weakly confined direction and also the direction most tightly compressed when the odt power is abruptly increased .    these temperature oscillations would be eliminated by bringing the dipolar gas out of the hydrodynamic regime by reducing the trapping frequencies",
    ". however , we can not reduce the trap frequencies since large trap depths are required to avoid plain evaporation of the gas after rethermalization  @xcite .",
    "an analytic understanding of the collective excitations that give rise to the temperature oscillations in this dipolar thermal gas are challenging and beyond the scope of the present work  .",
    "we find the frequency of the temperature oscillations to be reasonably well reproduced by the simulations .",
    "however , the phase and amplitude seem to be highly sensitive to values of the initial and final trap frequencies as well as to the details of the odt power ramp and are not closely replicated in the simulations . the correspondence between simulation and data",
    "can be improved by varying the simulated trap frequencies , total atom number , initial temperature , and odt ramp powers within experimental errors , but doing so for all data sets is computationally intensive .",

    "results for other @xmath39 and for @xmath5dy are qualitatively similar . ]            instead , we use a two - step fitting procedure to efficiently extract estimates of @xmath1 from the data sets based on the observation that simulating the full equilibration evolution from first principles  oscillations of the temperature in addition to the exponential increase in temperature  is unnecessary to achieve the goal of this work . the most direct influence that @xmath1 has on",
    "the gas is through the scattering rate given by @xmath86 , which directly contributes to the rate of equilibration in the gas .",
    "by contrast , the temperature oscillations in the gas are more closely related to details of the trapping frequencies than to the precise value of the @xmath0-wave scattering length .",
    "we may therefore extract the time constant associated with the @xmath0-wave cross section using a simpler model that is more robust to uncertainties in trap parameters and then use the full boltzmann equation simulation to relate this fit parameter to the value of @xmath1 .",

    "fig : datavsfittingfunction ] ) and to the simulation results along the @xmath88 and the @xmath89 axes separately .",
    "the fits are restricted to times after the end of the diabatic compression ramp .",
    "the following are free parameters : @xmath90 and @xmath91 are closely related to the initial and final temperatures , respectively ; @xmath92 is the time constant for rethermalization ; and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are the parameters of a damped sinusoid at the first harmonic of @xmath95 .",
    "our fitting function reproduces both experimental and simulation results with a reduced-@xmath83 of order unity .",
    "we search for values of the free - parameters which generate a local minimum in the error function @xmath97 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath98 is derived from either the experimental measurement or the simulation .",

    "we expect , based on physical grounds , that the damping time - scales @xmath92 and @xmath94 to be the free - parameters most affected by the scattering length ( through the cross section ) .",
    "we now focus our attention on these two parameters . for concreteness",

    "we find that the experimental data tightly constrain the values of @xmath85 and @xmath84 , the parameters that characterize the overall rethermalization of the gas following the sudden squeezing of the trap .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : datasimulation_rawcomparison ] shows that the experimental data are insufficient to make precise measurements of @xmath100 and @xmath102 , which characterize the damping of the collective oscillations .",

    "in contrast , along the @xmath89-axis the oscillation frequency is well captured by the data , but the amplitude is small compared to statistical errors .",
