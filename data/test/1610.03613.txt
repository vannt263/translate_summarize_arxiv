    "over the last three decades , the study of perturbed quantum harmonic oscillators has been on the edge of thrilling and exciting research .",
    "numerous methods have been developed to compute the energy eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation @xmath1 , where the hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "the case where the potential @xmath3 is a rational function of the form @xmath4 has been the subject of much interest . historically , the potential : @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 was among the first rational potentials to manifest interest in the scientific community .",
    "the schrdinger equation with such a potential is the analogue of a zero - dimensional field theory with a nonlinear lagrangian , which is still of interest in particle physics today @xcite .",
    "additionally , outside the realm of field theory , double - well potentials are among the most important potentials in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "double well potentials occur abundantly in the study of quantum information theory or quantum computing . concisely",
    ", quantum information theory attempts to generalize the ideas of classical information theory to the quantum world .",
    "recently , systems of two particles in double well potentials have been studied experimentally with ultracold atoms @xcite . in 2009",
    ", it was theoretically proposed that neutral atoms held in double well potentials could be used to create quantum logic gates to be used for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "recently , murmann et al . demonstrated that the quantum state of two ultracold fermionic atoms in an isolated double - well potential was completely controllable @xcite .",
    "they were able to control the interaction strength between these two particles , the tilt of the potential as well as their tunneling rates between the two wells .",
    "these experiments provide a starting point for quantum computation with neutral atoms .",
    "hence , further investigations into quantum systems with multiple wells could be an asset in constructing an efficient and reliable quantum computers .",
    "there is a rich and diverse collection of techniques and algorithms available in literature to compute the energy eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation with the rational potential . among others ,",
    "the use of variational methods , perturbation series , and perturbed ladder operators methods have been readily used to approximate the energy eigenvalues of this potential @xcite . to understand the innate structure of the potential , several exact representations for the energy eigenvalues of this potential were found for specific relations between the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the hill determinant method as well as the hill determinant method with a variational parameter have been used extensively to numerically calculate the energy eigenvalues of @xcite .",
    "methods utilizing power series , taylor series and pad approximants have also been used frequently in literature @xcite .",

    "numerical results are presented for a variety of potentials of the form in equation .",
    "the numerical accuracy of the proposed asymptotic estimates increase as their corresponding energy levels increase .    in @xcite ,",
    "a matrix - continued - fraction algorithm is introduced to calculate the energy eigenvalues of rational potentials of the form : @xmath21 this method is based on an expansion of the eigenfunctions into complete sets .",
    "in addition to the proposed method , numerical results are given only for the nested potential in equation   as well as polynomial potentials ( i.e. @xmath22 ) .",

    "@xmath23 are evaluated using a finite difference approach .",
    "numerical results are presented for a variety of parameters and they are in good agreement with other results obtained in literature .    as can be seen by the numerous approaches which have been made to solve this problem , there is a lack of uniformity in its resolution .",
    "moreover , the task of evaluating energy eigenvalues for any general rational potential has only been studied lightly .",
    "while several of these methods yield excellent results for specific cases of rational potentials namely the potential in equation , it would be favorable to have one algorithm capable of handling any rational potential of the form @xmath24 , which can deliver all eigenvalues efficiently to a high pre - determined accuracy .",
    "it is the purpose of this research work to present such a general method based on the double exponential sinc - collocation method ( descm)presented in @xcite .",
    "the descm starts by approximating the wave function as a series of weighted sinc functions . by substituting this approximation in the schrdinger equation and evaluating this expression at several collocation points ,",
    "we obtain a generalized eigensystem where the generalized eigenvalues are approximations to the energy eigenvalues .",

    "a major motivation behind the use of sinc expansions stems from numerical integration .",
    "as it happens , integration of sinc expansions have a direct connection with the composite trapezoidal rule .",
    "it is well known from the euler - maclaurin summation formula that the error in approximating the integral of a measurable function @xmath40 defined on the interval @xmath41 by the composite trapezoidal rule is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the bernoulli numbers and @xmath44 is the number of points in the interval of integration , from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "hence , for a periodic function or a function for which @xmath47 at the endpoints , the convergence is faster than any power of @xmath48 .",
