    "quantum physics of interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems represents a fascinating research area @xcite .",
    "most important experimental realizations include electrons in 1d nanostructures ( quantum hall and topological insulator edges , carbon nanotubes , semiconductor quantum wires ) , quantum spin chains , and cold atoms ( bosons as well as fermions ) in optical traps .",
    "one of central directions of current research is the physics of nonequilibrium phenomena in these structures .    in the cold atoms context",
    "( see ref .   for a review ,",
    "the most frequently considered nonequilibrium setting is a quantum quench @xcite : one explores a quantum evolution of the system after a sudden change of one of the parameters .",
    "in particular , one can modify the optical lattice potential confining the atoms .",
    "an alternative possibility is to suddenly change the interaction strength by employing a strong dependence of interaction on the magnetic field in the vicinity of feshbach resonance .",
    "it has been recognized that , upon an interaction quench , a luttinger liquid shows an interesting dynamics and eventually evolves into a non - thermal state characterized by nonequilibrium power - law correlations @xcite .",
    "subsequent theoretical works explored various generalizations of this problem @xcite .    on the other hand , in the context of electronic systems ,",
    "typical nonequilibrium setups are of steady - state character ( as obtained by applying bias voltages to some of source electrodes ) .",
    "recent experiments have addressed nonequilibrium spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes @xcite and quantum hall edge states @xcite as well as nonequilibrium edge state interferometry @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , one of important recent theoretical advances was a development of the method of nonequilibrium bosonization @xcite that permits , in particular , to treat luttinger liquids with distribution functions of incoming electrons that have multiple fermi edges .",
    "it was shown that this leads to a multiple - branch zero - bias anomaly with exponents and dephasing rates controlled by the nonequilibrium state of the system .",
    "related results have been obtained for the problems of quantum hall edge state spectroscopy @xcite and mach - zehnder interferometry @xcite .    while two types of nonequilibrium luttinger liquid setups ( a temporal interaction quench and a steady - state with multiple fermi edges originating from applied voltages ) are quite different , there is a remarkable similarity between the results . in both cases ,",
    "one finds non - trivial power - law exponents that are essentially different from the equilibrium ones . in this paper",
    ", we show that both kinds of nonequilibrium settings can be treated within a unified framework of the nonequilibrium bosonization .",
    "we employ this formalism to explore the dynamics after an interaction quench in an initially nonequilibrium luttinger liquid .",
    "the fermi - edge exponents and dephasing are controlled by charge fractionalization at temporal ( and possibly spatial ) boundaries of the interaction region and by the input nonequilibrium distributions .",
    "the luttinger model describes the low - energy physics of interacting 1d fermions .",
    "it turns out that low - energy excitations can be fully captured in terms of bosonic modes .",
    "a free 1d fermionic system with right - moving modes @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) close to the fermi points can be mapped onto a free 1d bosonic system with a linear spectrum @xmath2 with density operators @xmath3 and fermi velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the fermionic operators can be likewise expressed in terms of bosonic operators @xmath5 where the phase operators @xmath6 are related to densities via @xmath7 . while counterpropagating density modes are uncoupled for originally free fermions , they are mixed by interaction .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for short - range interaction is @xmath8 to describe the interaction quench we let the coupling parameters @xmath9 be time dependent . in more physical terms",
    "we assume that the switching time is much shorter than all characteristic time scales of the problem set for example by the inverse voltage @xmath10 , see sec .",
    "[ s3.1 ] below . in the presence of interaction",
    "the new bosonic eigenmodes , the `` plasmons '' @xmath11 , are obtained by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath12 with the luttinger parameter @xmath13 the full hamiltonian after the quench then reads @xmath14 with the plasmon velocity @xmath15 in thermal equilibrium the many - body density matrix @xmath16 is a function of @xmath17 , thus it is straightforwardly expressed as an exponential of bilinears of bosonic fields .    ref .   considered time - evolution after a sudden interaction switch - on .",
    "the initially noninteracting system is prepared in the thermal equilibrium state @xmath18 which after the quench no longer represents equilibrium ( with respect to the full hamiltonian @xmath17 ) . however",
    ", the time - evolution of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be deduced by the bogoliubov transformation ( [ eqn : bogoliubov ] ) .",
    "calculations there were performed with a finite interaction range @xmath22 as short - distance regularization . at long distances",
    "@xmath23 results are insensitive to the regularization scheme , and momentum - dependent coupling parameters ( associated with finite interaction range ) can be replaced by their zero momentum values , @xmath24 .",
    "the equal - time correlation function then is @xmath25 where the exponent is determined by @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the free fermionic green s function .    for short times such that @xmath28 the correlation function @xmath29 can be interpreted as the green s function of an effective time - dependent fermi liquid with `` landau quasiparticle weight '' @xmath30 which gives rise to a discontinuity in the momentum distribution function @xmath31 at fermi momentum @xmath32 .",
    "according to ( [ eqn : quencheqqpweight ] ) the jump decays algebraically with time  @xmath33 .    for large times",
    "@xmath34 the system reaches a time - independent steady state with power - law correlations @xmath35 the corresponding momentum distribution function no longer exhibits a discontinuity at @xmath32 , but instead has a power - law singularity @xmath36 .",
    "this behavior is very similar to that observed in an equilibrium luttinger liquid  @xcite , however with an exponent @xmath37 that differs from the equilibrium one , @xmath38 .",
    "hence , while interactions drive the dynamical evolution which destroy the fermi - liquid character of the spectral function , the integrability prevents the system from relaxation into thermal equilibrium .",
    "in this section we consider the quench problem in the luttinger liquid prepared in a nonequilibrium initial state with double - step distribution functions .",
    "first we present the key details of our calculations within the nonequilibrium bosonization framework and then discuss the obtained results .",
    "in our paper we consider initial states in which fermionic right-/left - moving single - particle states @xmath39 are independently occupied according to distribution functions @xmath40 which have two sharp fermi edges at @xmath41 and @xmath10 . for such nonequilibrium states",
    "the initial density matrix is not an exponential of an operator quadratic in the plasmonic modes .",
    "this makes the nonequilibrium problem considerably more complicated in comparison with the equilibrium one .",
    "a general framework to deal with this class of problems has been developed in ref .   where the operator bosonization method was combined with the keldysh action technique . within this approach the right - movers single - particle green s function @xmath42/\\delta_0[\\delta_\\eta]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be expressed in terms of a functional determinant of a fredholm operator , @xmath43 = \\operatorname{det}\\left[{{\\mathds 1}}-f_\\eta+e^{i\\delta_\\eta } f_\\eta\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the distribution function @xmath44 is diagonal in energy representation , the counting phase @xmath45 is diagonal in the conjugate time representation .",

    "<S> we study the relaxation dynamics of a _ nonequilibrium _ luttinger liquid after a sudden interaction switch - on ( `` quench '' ) , focussing on a double - step initial momentum distribution function . in the framework of the non - equilibrium bosonization , </S>",
    "<S> the results are obtained in terms of singular fredholm determinants that are evaluated numerically and whose asymptotics are found analytically . while the quasi - particle weights decay exponentially with time after the quench , </S>",
    "<S> this is not a relaxation into a thermal state , in view of the integrability of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state distribution emerging at infinite times retains two edges which support luttinger - liquid - like power - law singularities smeared by dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained critical exponents and the dephasing length are found to depend on the initial nonequilibrium state . </S>"
