    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that exhibit bright , soft , transient x - ray outbursts often contain stellar - mass black hole primaries ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "x - ray observations of these objects only tell part of the story , as their orbital periods and masses are typically determined through observations of their optical counterparts .    observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have provided discoveries of many bright transient x - ray sources in m31 in the past few years ( @xcite , and many others ) .",
    "however , the optical properties of such events in m31 have received attention only recently .",
    "combined optical / x - ray studies of x - ray transients constrains their orbital periods . through continued monitoring of the bulge of m31 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory ( chandra ) _ and _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , we have discovered several bright , soft , transient x - ray sources @xcite . in some cases , the coordinated optical observations of these transient events",
    "has led to the identification of probable optical counterpart candidates @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "the observations have led to meaningful upper limits on the optical luminosities of the x - ray transient during outburst @xcite .",
    "as the sample of such systems grows , it will become possible to perform statistical tests , using properties such as the luminosity and period distribution of the sample to test models of binary formation and evolution .",
    "herein we report an outburst from a transient x - ray source in the m31 bulge . coordinated optical observations of the source",
    "reveal no variable optical counterpart candidate and show that its optical counterpart must have been fainter than @xmath8 .",
    "section 2 details our observations and analysis techniques .",
    "section 3 gives the results of the analysis .",
    "section 4 discusses the implications of the results , and   5 provides the conclusions from our work .",
    "we obtained six observations with the _ chandra _ acis - i between january 2004 and november 2004 relevant to this study .",
    "the observation identification numbers , dates , pointings , roll angles , and exposure times of these observations are given in table  [ xobs ] .",
    "although the observations were taken for 5 ks each , the effective exposure was reduced by @xmath320% because the data were taken in `` alternating readout mode '' in order to avoid pileup for any bright transient source .",
    "all of these observations were reduced in an identical fashion using ciao 3.1 .",
    "we created exposure maps for the images using the task _ merge_all _ , and we found and measured positions and count rates of the sources in the images using the ciao task _ wavdetect _ .. these data sets each had 3@xmath9 detection limits of @xmath32.2@xmath1010@xmath11 ct s@xmath5 , corresponding to 0.310 kev luminosities of @xmath32@xmath1010@xmath12 erg s@xmath5 for a typical lmxb system in m31 .",

    "we searched our source lists for new sources brighter than 1.5@xmath1010@xmath13 erg s@xmath5 that had not appeared in earlier chandra images or on recently published lists of x - ray sources in m31 .",
    "we focus here on one such source which appeared on 15-aug-2004 at r.a.=0:42:41.814 , dec .",
    "= 41:16:35.86 .",
    "the source is coincident with an x - ray source seen by the _",
    "hri in january 1979 called tf  47 with a 0.24 kev luminosity of 1.5@xmath1010@xmath13 erg s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it has not been detected since that outburst .",
    "we give this source the formal name cxom31  j004241.8 + 411635 and the short name r1 - 36 using the naming conventions spelled out in table  2 of @xcite .",
    "this source is 0.65@xmath14 northwest of the m31 nucleus .",
    "we aligned the coordinate system of the x - ray images with the optical images of the local group survey ( lgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the positions of x - ray sources with known globular cluster counterparts were aligned with the globular cluster centers in the lgs images using the iraf task _",
    "ccmap_. the precise alignment errors for the observations , which were applied in determining the x - ray error ellipse , are given in table  [ xpos ] .",
    "the position errors of the source on the x - ray images was measured using the iraf task _",
    "imcentroid_. these errors were all @xmath150.1@xmath1 and are also provided in table  [ xpos ] . the final position and errors on the position",
    "were calculated by adding the alignment and position errors for each measurement in quadrature and then taking the weighted mean of the three independent position measurements .",
    "finally , the spectra of r1 - 36 were extracted using the ciao task _ psextract _ , binning the spectrum in energy so that each bin contained @xmath1620 counts .",
    "we then fit each spectrum using ciao 3.1/sherpa , trying both a power - law with absorption and a disk blackbody model with absorption .",
    "all of the errors reported are 1@xmath9 unless otherwise specified .",
    "errors in the spectral fits were obtained with the _ covariance _ routine in sherpa .",
    "luminosity errors take into account the normalization errors in the spectral fitting , but count rate errors do not .",
    "results are discussed in   [ results ] .",
    "we obtained three sets of images containing the position of r1 - 36 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard _",
    "the first data set , pointed at r.a.=00:42:43.86 , dec.=41:16:30.1 with an orientation of 55 degrees , was taken on 23-jan-2004 in an attempt to detect a different transient source .",
    "this dataset fortuitously contained the position of r1 - 36 before it became active .",
    "the second , pointed at r.a.=00:42:41.50 , dec.=41:17:00.0 with an orientation of 220 degrees , was taken 15-aug-2004 while the x - ray source was active .",
    "the final observations , pointed at r.a.=00:42:41.50 , dec.=41:17:05.0 with an orientation of 116 degrees , was taken 22-nov-2004 after the x - ray source faded .",
    "all three data sets were obtained through the f435w ( @xmath17 equivalent ) filter using the acs 4-point box dither pattern in order to allow us to recover the best possible spatial resolution .",
    "the total exposure time for each set was 2200 s. each epoch was combined in an identical manner using the pyraf task _ multidrizzle _ , which has been optimized to process acs imaging data .",
    "the task removes cosmic ray events and geometric distortions , and it combines the dithered frames together into one final photometric image in units of counts per second .",
    "we utilized the capabilities of this task to improve the sampling of the final images to 0.025@xmath1 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "each final image was aligned with the lgs reference frame using stars common to both images .",
    "the adjustment of the coordinate systems of the @xmath18 images was performed using the iraf task _ ccmap_. in all cases , the rms errors of the alignment were smaller than 1 acs pixel .",
    "the excellent agreement between the independently aligned frames can be seen in figure  [ ims ] .",
    "photometry was performed on the relevant sections of the final images using daophot  ii and allstar @xcite .",
    "the count rates measured ( 0.25@xmath1 radius aperture ) were converted to vega magnitudes ( @xmath17 equivalent ) using the conversion formulas provided in the acs data handbook .",
    "the crowding this close to the m31 nucleus limited the depth to which we could resolve individual stars .",
    "the limitations of the photometry were investigated by comparing the results for the same section of sky in the second and third acs data sets .",
    "figure  [ comp ] shows the percentage of stars detected in only one data set as a function of @xmath17 magnitude within 9@xmath1 of the position of r1 - 36 .",
    "the results show that confusion begins to limit the completeness of the data at @xmath19 , and the completeness decreases to 50% at @xmath20 .",
    "we determined the position of r1 - 36 by taking the weighted mean of the position determination from the three independent detections .",
    "the errors for each of the three position measurements were calculated by taking the root - sum - square of the _ imcentroid _ error of the position on the detector and the _ ccmap _ alignment error with the lgs coordinate system .",
    "all of these errors are provided in table  [ xpos ] , resulting in a final position and 1@xmath9 error of r.a.=0:42:41.814@xmath00.08@xmath1 , decl.=41:16:35.86@xmath00.07@xmath1 .",
    "this position is shown with the 3@xmath9 error ellipses on figure  [ ims ] .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve of r1 - 36 is shown in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "this lightcurve , which shows a slow decrease in x - ray flux followed by a sharp drop after 3 months , clearly did not follow a strict exponential decay ( the best fitting exponential has @xmath21=23 ) . however , in the 26 days between the final detection and the first non - detection , the flux decreased by a factor of at least 9 .",
    "this final decay therefore had an @xmath22-folding decay time of at most 12 days if exponential decay is assumed .",
    "this type of decay is not unique .",
    "similar decay patterns have been seen in some galactic outbursts , such as the second half of the 19981999 outburst of xte  j1550 - 564 @xcite .",
    "source r1 - 36 is a second detection of the transient x - ray source tf  47 .",
    "this source has not been detected since the _ einstein _ era , when it was detected in only a single epoch of observations with the hri ( 1979  january ; @xcite ) .",
    "two detected outbursts of this source over all of the epochs of _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , _ xmm _ , and _",
    "observations constrain the duty cycle of the transient . assuming that the transient was active for about the same length of time when it appeared in 1979 as it was during this outburst ( @xmath33 months ) , the transient was active for at least 6 months over the past 25 years , giving a lower limit to the duty cycle of 0.02 . at the same time , all of the _ chandra _ observations of m31 to date have observed 1999  october2002  august and 2003  november2004  november without seeing the source active more than this one time .",
    "the longest gaps in these observations were @xmath34 months . assuming no outbursts were missed during this monitoring period",
    ", we can infer an upper limit on the duty cycle of 0.06 .",
    "therefore the duty cycle of r1 - 36 is likely 0.020.06 .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the three detections of r1 - 36 were all well - fitted by absorbed disk blackbody and absorbed power - law models .",
    "they all show that the spectrum is softer than those of high - mass x - ray binaries , which typically show hard spectra dominated by power - laws of index closer to 1 , the best - fitting indexes were @xmath23 ; such values are in the range for lmxbs in the thermal - dominant state ( @xmath2425 ; see table 4.4 in @xcite ) suggesting that the system is an lmxb containing an accreting compact object .",
    "the absorption values in these fits were quite high for soft bright m31 x - ray sources , which typically have n@xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "because the absorption values for the power - law fits were unusually high , we did not consider a power - law the appropriate model for fitting our data from r1 - 36 .",
    "however , for completeness , the results from the power - law fits are given in table  [ pl ] .    in the disk blackbody fits ( see table  [ spectab1 ] ) , the measured absorption was within the errors of the known foreground absorption toward m31 [ 5@xmath1010@xmath27 @xmath26 for @xmath28 @xcite ] .",
    "we therefore fixed the absorption to this value for all three detections .",
    "these fits yielded temperatures similar to those of galactic lmxbs in outburst @xcite and indicated a decrease in temperature as the x - ray flux faded .",
    "the best - fitting parameter values , along with the improved fitting statistics , suggest that a disk blackbody is the physical process responsible for most of the x - ray emission from r1 - 36 .",
    "we provide all of the details of the disk blackbody spectral fits in table  [ spectab1 ] .",
    "the fits yield an unabsorbed 0.37 kev x - ray luminosity during the 15-aug-2004 _ hst _ observation of @xmath35@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "this luminosity does not shed light as to the nature of the accreting compact object because it is below the eddington limit for both neutron stars and black holes",
    ". however , the observed decay of the x - ray flux and disk temperature are hallmarks of the decline of black hole transients in the thermal dominant state ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the coordinated @xmath18 images of the region of interest are shown on the left side of figure  [ ims ] .",
    "each image is shown next to the most contemporaneous x - ray image , and the 3@xmath9 position error ellipse for the position of r1 - 36 is drawn on each image .",
    "the analysis of these images is severely hampered by crowding , as demonstrated by the unresolved structure in all three images .",
    "there is no obvious bright star in the error ellipse , consistent with the x - ray spectrum in suggesting that the source is an lmxb .",
    "the daophot analysis of the optical data did not reveal any resolved stars inside the error ellipse brighter than @xmath8 .",
    "no star in or near the error ellipse shows a significant increase in brightness during the epoch when the x - ray source was active . the only star detected in the 15-aug-2004 observation ( when r1 - 36 was active ) inside the error ellipse",
    "is marked with the arrows on figure  [ ims ] at r.a.=00:42:41.803 , dec.=41:16:36.00 .",
    "this sole resolved star is blended with the bright @xmath29 star 0.1@xmath1 to the north , outside the error ellipse .",
    "the star inside the ellipse was measured to be brightest in the 15-aug-2004 observation , with @xmath30 .",
    "this star was also detected in the 23-jan-2004 observation ( when r1 - 36 was quiescent ) , but it was slightly fainter ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "it was not detected by daophot in the 22-nov-2004 observation .    the low - significance brightness increase and disappearance of this star",
    "make it the only optical counterpart candidate for r1 - 36 , but the variability detection is not reliable .",
    "the increase in brightness is only 1.6@xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the results of our completeness study , shown in figure  [ comp ] , indicate that the completeness begins to decrease at @xmath32 , and is only @xmath380% at @xmath8 , providing a 1/5 chance that such a star will be missed in the analysis .",
    "therefore the fact that it was missed in 1 out of 3 images is not unexpected . on the other hand , as this was the only star detected in the 3@xmath9 error ellipse in the 15-aug-2004 data , it provides a reliable upper - limit of @xmath33 for the optical brightness of the x - ray transient during outburst .",
    "for the purpose of determining an upper limit to the optical luminosity of the outburst , we assume that the counterpart candidate with @xmath30 was the counterpart . with n@xmath34 @xmath26 ( see table  [ spectab1 ] ) ,",
    "applying the relation of @xcite and a standard extinction law , we find @xmath35 . assuming @xmath36-m=24.47 , the absolute @xmath17 magnitude was @xmath37 . assuming an intrinsic @xmath38 color of @xmath39 [ the mean of the galactic lmxb catalog of @xcite ] , we find @xmath40 , or an upper - limit of @xmath41 .",
    "our measurements allow us to provide a rough prediction of the orbital period of r1 - 36 using the empirical relation between x - ray luminosity , optical luminosity , and orbital period for galactic lmxbs determined by @xcite .",
    "this relation has been tested for more recent transient events and for observations separated by up to 3 weeks by @xcite , showing that it provides reliable orbital period predictions even for events with complex multiwavelength lightcurves .",
    "in addition , since r1 - 36 shows a decay curve reminiscent of the second - half of the 1998 - 1999 outburst of xte  j1550 - 564 , we tested the relation for this case .",
    "the second half of that outburst had an x - ray luminosity of @xmath42 erg s@xmath5 ( for a distance of 5.3@xmath02.3 kpc ; @xcite ) , and the optical counterpart showed @xmath43 . applying the extinction of @xmath44 @xcite gives m@xmath45 .",
    "these numbers would yield a period prediction of @xmath161 day .",
    "this limit is correct , as the true period is 1.55 days .    in the case of r1 - 36 , if we insert the optical luminosity of @xmath40 and the unabsorbed 0.37 kev x - ray luminosity of 5@xmath1010@xmath13 erg s@xmath5 into the @xcite relation , we obtain a prediction for the orbital period of 1.7@xmath46 days .",
    "therefore , assuming r1 - 36 is an lmxb similar to those in our own galaxy and that the true counterpart was no brighter than the only star detected within the 3@xmath9 error ellipse during the outburst , the predicted upper - limit for the period of the system is @xmath475.2 days .",
    "ideally we would like to fully classify the transient x - ray source r1 - 36 .",
    "while its observed properties show that it is an lmxb in m31 , the current observations do not allow a final conclusion to be drawn as to whether the primary member of the binary is a neutron star or black hole . nevertheless , the similarities between r1 - 36 and x - ray binaries known to contain black holes make it a good black hole candidate .    first of all , the source is most likely in m31 . at",
    "the flux levels observed ( @xmath35@xmath1010@xmath48 erg @xmath26 s@xmath5 ) , the number of background sources is @xmath151 per square degree ( extrapolating the results of @xcite to brighter fluxes ) . with our acis field covering @xmath30.07 deg@xmath49 , the probability that this source is in the background is @xmath157% .",
    "the source is also unlikely to be in the foreground .",
    "the disk blackbody spectral fits provide a normalization value that , given the distance to the source , indicates @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the inner radius of the accretion disk in km and @xmath52 is the inclination of the disk ) .",
    "if the source is at the distance of m31 ( 780 kpc ) , @xmath53 km , physically reasonable for a compact object . on the other hand , if the source is in the foreground ( 10 kpc ) , @xmath54 km , quite small for any accreting object , even for high inclination angles .",
    "together , these results suggest the source is in m31 .",
    "the source is likely an lmxb , as suggested by the significant variability , spectrum , and lack of high - mass stellar counterpart candidates .",
    "the current data set allows either a neutron star or black hole primary .",
    "there are spectral characteristics that could discern between the two , such as a blackbody component indicative of a neutron star envelope @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our spectra are not of sufficient quality to reliably detect such additional components .",
    "our spectra of r1 - 36 are soft , are well - fitted by a disk blackbody model , and indicate a peak luminosity of @xmath35@xmath1010@xmath13 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "lmxbs with black hole primaries and those with neutron star primaries can both have soft disk blackbody spectral components and peak luminosities of @xmath310@xmath1310@xmath55 erg s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "our x - ray spectra therefore allow the presence of either type of compact object .",
    "while we can not be certain about the nature of the compact object in r1 - 36 , it certainly could contain a black hole .",
    "most known transient x - ray binaries containing neutron stars are hmxbs with be secondaries .",
    "source r1 - 36 has a softer spectrum and a fainter secondary than such hmxb transients .",
    "in addition , more than half of galactic transient lmxbs contain black holes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with the exception of grs 1915 + 105 , which has remained active since its discovery in 1992 , all lmxbs with dynamically - confirmed black hole primaries are transient sources @xcite .    finally , the x - ray decay pattern of r1 - 36 mimics typical decays of black hole binaries but differs from typical decays of neutron star binaries .",
    "the inner disk temperature of r1 - 36 decays from 1.2 kev to 0.8 kev ; similarly , black hole binaries in the thermal dominant state have very comparable disk temperatures ( e.g. , see table 4 in @xcite ) that invariably decay smoothly and monotonically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , neutron star binaries appear to exhibit constant or non - monotonic temperatures as they decay in the soft state .",
    "for example , aquila x-1 showed a constant inner disk temperature of @xmath32.3 kev during the thermal dominant phase of its 2000 outburst @xcite , and the temperature of 4u 1630 - 47 first declined rapidly and thereafter fluctuated irregularly around a value of @xmath30.7 kev during most of its decline phase @xcite .",
    "these comparisons indicate that r1 - 36 has more in common with known black hole binaries than with neutron star binaries .",
    "succinctly , our data set can not reliably determine the nature of the primary in the m31 lmxb x - ray transient r1 - 36 .",
    "on the other hand , the data show that r1 - 36 is not similar to most x - ray binaries known to contain neutron stars , which are persistent and/or have high - mass secondaries .",
    "the data also show that r1 - 36 _ is _ similar to most x - ray binaries known to contain black holes , which are transient , have low - mass secondaries , and exhibit similar luminosity and temperature decay patterns .",
    "these similarities make r1 - 36 a good black hole candidate in m31 .",
    "we have studied a recent outburst of the x - ray transient source tf  47 @xcite , which we have detected on three occasions with _ chandra_. we call this most recent outburst cxom31  j004241.8 + 411635 , or r1 - 36",
    ". this second detected outburst from this source suggests its duty cycle is in the range 0.020.06 .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum of the source indicates that it is likely an lmxb .",
    "spectral fits suggest the x - rays came from a hot accretion disk with an inner edge temperature of @xmath31 kev .",
    "the absorption - corrected 0.37 kev luminosity of the source during the outburst was @xmath35@xmath1010@xmath13 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "@xmath18 acs observations before , during , and after the outburst set a limit of @xmath56 for the counterpart to the system .",
    "this fact supports the argument that the secondary is low - mass .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and optical upper - limit during outburst suggest the period of the binary system is @xmath475.2 days .",
    "the x - ray spectrum and optical data show that r1 - 36 is a transient lmxb in m31 .",
    "this evidence does not allow a reliable conclusion as to the nature of the primary , as neither the spectrum nor the luminosity of r1 - 36 rule out the possibility that the accreting compact object is a neutron star . in the galaxy , these types of sources have a higher probability of containing a black hole than do hmxbs or persistent bright x - ray sources .",
    "in addition , the x - ray decay properties of r1 - 36 bear a stronger resemblance to black hole binaries than to neutron star binaries .",
    "therefore , while there is no conclusive evidence that r1 - 36 contains a black hole , it is a good black hole candidate .    out of 6 transient x - ray sources likely",
    "to be lmxbs whose optical luminosities have been studied so far @xcite , this is the fourth one with a predicted orbital period estimate of less than a few days .",
    "the three others are s1 - 86 @xcite , r2 - 71 @xcite , and r3 - 127 @xcite .",
    "together , these results begin to hint that at least half of the transient lmxb sources in the m31 bulge may be rather short period systems with small accretion disks .",
    "while the statistics of a sample of 6 are clearly limited , the orbital period distribution ( inferred from the x - ray / optical luminosity ratio distribution ) does not appear grossly different from that of similar systems in the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
