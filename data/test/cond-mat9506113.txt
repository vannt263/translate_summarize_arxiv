    "the fermion chern - simons field theoretical approach @xcite , motivated by the composite fermions theory @xcite in which the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite is viewed as the integer qhe of certain bound objects of electrons and vortices , i.e , the  composite fermions \" , has shown to be a useful method for investigating the physical properties of the fqhe .",
    "in such a field theoretical approach , one , roughly speaking ,  attaches \" even number of flux quanta to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons through introducing the so called chern - simons gauge field . in the mean - field approximation where the statistical gauge fluxes",
    "are delocalized from the electrons and uniformly spread out in the 2d plane , this mean gauge field partially cancels the external magnetic field such that at certain filling fractions the mean - field state is descibed by integer number of filled effective landau level ( ll ) , which signals the occurrence of the fqhe .",
    "qualitatively correct physics of the fqhe may be recovered by incorporating the effect of fluctuations of the gauge field .",
    "this approach has been adopted for investigating the fqhe at filling fractions with odd - denominators at zero temperature in @xcite , and at finite temperature in @xcite . for the @xmath2 state ,",
    "in which the mean statistical field and external magnetic field precisely cancel each other such that the mean - field theory is just a filled fermi sea , this approach @xcite has successfully explained the anomaly in the surface acoustic wave propagation @xcite .",
    "its qualitative correctness has also been verified by a series of experiments @xcite .",
    "since the fqhe is observed in the presence of high magnetic field @xmath3 , it is conceivable that the fqhe may be understood at the infinite magnetic field limit , where the hilbert space is composed solely by the states in the lowest ll ( lll ) .",
    "this limit is important conceptually , since in which the kinetic energy is frozen , showing clearly the non - perturbative effect of electron - electron interactions . because the size of the hilbert space is drastically reduced by the restriction to the lll",
    ", this limit is also of great convenience for numerical studies which have been indispensable to the development of our understanding of the fqhe .",
    "the seminal work of laughlin @xcite is formulated entirely within the lll .",
    "noticeably that jain s wavefunction , whose construction is aided with states in higher lls ( to utilize the mapping between fqh states and iqh states ) , also needs to be ultimately mapped back to the lll in order to give the correct low energy physics @xcite .",
    "the importance of the lll is not explicit in the present field theoretical approach , at least not in the first order loop expansion commonly adopted in the literature .",
    "in fact the electron - electron interaction , which is crucial for the occurrence of the fqhe , plays only a nominal role in the chern - simons field theory scheme mentioned above .",
    "formally , if one actually carried out the same calculation for non - interacting electrons at these special fillings ( become clear later ) , one would obtain qualitatively the same physics ( e.g. , incompressibility of the ground state ) as that with interactions . on the positive side",
    ", this fact may be interpreted as the  correctness \" of the mean - field theory @xcite ; on the other hand , it is also quite disturbing since we know that the ground state of a system of non - interacting electrons with a partially filled ll is compressible and is highly degenerate , and the fqhe occurs only as a result of strong electron - electron correlations . because the interaction has not been treated properly , the energy scale of the problem in this approach is incorrectly given by an effective cyclotron energy which is on the same order of the bare cyclotron energy , while the physical energy scale is set by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "this serious defect of the theory not only renders any quantitative description of the low energy physics of the fqhe impossible , but has also raised a fundamental question concerning the validity of the theory itself . in @xcite , this problem was dealt phenomenologically through a fermi liquid theory . in this approach , the magnetic field is treated semi - classically , and the effective mass is introduced as a free parameter .",
    "this fermi liquid approach has been examined recently through a comparison with exact numerical results on small systems @xcite .",
    "while it provides a way of dealing the problem of mass renormalization , its phenomenological nature is unsatisfactory .",
    "furthermore , for fqh states at filling fraction such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 etc .",
    "in which the number of filled effective lls are small , the semi - classical approximation is expected to break down due to the strong effective magnetic field .",
    "what we would like to have is a microscopic formalism with a mean - field theory for which minimal fluctuation corrections are needed to reveal the qualitatively ( and quantitatively ) correct physics . with this philosophy in mind , we propose here a fermion chern - simons field theory constrained to the lll , in which the essential role of the electron - electron interaction for the fqhe is explicit .",
    "our hope is that true physics may be revealed in some low order perturbation expansion .    in the lll",
    ", the kinetic energy is frozen and the effect of interaction is non - perturbative .",
    "there are several works in the literature dealing with the issue of formulating field theories constrained in the lll @xcite .",
    "however , since the states in the lll are incomplete , a field theory constructed directly from the states in the lll possesses some peculiar properties which make evaluations of physical properties extremely difficult .",
    "here we shall follow an alternative formalism . to illustrate our approach ,",
    "it is instructive to have a closer look at jain s construction of the ground state wavefunction for a fqh state @xcite .",
    "while the wavefunction itself is built solely from the states in the lll , it is constructed in such a way that the role of higher lls is explicit .",
    "mathematically , it provides a compact way of expressing otherwise ( i.e. , writing directly within the hilbert space of the lll ) an extremely complicated object .",
    "physically , it helps tremendously in gaining insight ( i.e. , bridging the connection between the fqhe and the iqhe ) to the problem .",
    "our approach here is similar in spirit : instead of working directly in the subspace spanned by the states in the lll , we shall start with the whole hilbert space to utilize the notion of mapping the fqhe onto the iqhe .",
    "the restriction to the lll is enforced by a @xmath0-functional described by an auxiliary field @xmath7 ( see below ) .",
    "thus , just like that in jain s theory one employs states in the higher lls to construct the wavefunction but ultimately projects it back to the lll , here we use the higher lls in intermediate stages of calculations and integrate out the @xmath1-field at the end to realize the constraint . as we shall see later , in this theory the density and current fluctuations not only couples to themselves and to each other , but also couples to a local kinetic energy density such that the constraint to the lll is satisfied .",
    "a direct consequence of this approach is to provide a microscopic calculation of the energy gap , which is experimentally measurable @xcite and is an important quantity for estimating the effect of thermal fluctuations on the accuracy of the fqhe .",
    "one may also study the low energy collective excitation spectrum within the present theory .",
    "the properties of low energy excitations may be extrapolated from numerical results obtained through exact diagonalization on small systems @xcite and from direct construction of trial wavefunctions for low energy excited states @xcite , or be studied through the chern - simons - landau - ginzburg field theory @xcite .",
    "while these studies are very useful to our understanding of the physics of the fqhe , for quantitative comparisons with experiments we still need a _ microscopic _",
    "calculation done directly in the _ thermodynamic limit _ , especially in view of the current discrepancies between experiments and theories on the physical quantities such as the magnitude of the energy gap .",
    "the previous works using the unconstrained fermion chern - simons field theory @xcite can not serve this purpose owing to its intrinsic difficulty with the energy scale discussed above .    in the present work",
    ", we shall consider only those systems with filling fraction @xmath8 ( @xmath9 integer ) whose ground states are known to be incompressible and for whom there are considerable amount of numerical results available which may be helpful for testing the correctness of our theory . on the other hand , computations , especially the numerical solution for the dressed stationary point equation of the @xmath1-field in such a system",
    "are unfortunately much more complicated than that for a @xmath10 system in which the mean - field ground state is just a filled fermi sea . however , since the calculation of the @xmath11 state is quite different from the present one , it shall be studied in a separate work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as following : in the next section we present the formalism of our approach ; in section iii , we study the electro - magnetic response ; we discuss some consequences of the theory and conclude in the section iv .",
    "the quantum many - body wave function describing a system of 2d electrons of band mass @xmath12 in a magnetic field @xmath13 occupying only the lll satisfies the condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cyclotron frequency . in the second quantized language",
    ", one may express the partition function for such a system by a coherent functional integral subjected to a constraint : @xmath16 with the action ( in the unit @xmath17 ) @xmath18 -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{c}\\psi^{\\dagger}\\psi(r ) \\right \\ } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression , @xmath19 is the chemical potential which fixes the ll filling fraction at @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is a two - body interaction potential . in this paper",
    "we shall consider the coulomb interaction explicitly in our calculation , where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the dielectric constant .",
    "other forms of interaction may be substituted straightforwardly into our calculations .",
    "the last term is a @xmath0-functional enforcing the constraint ( [ con1 ] ) , where the kinetic energy term is symmetrized with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "notice that since the kinetic and potential energy term do not commute with each other , the constraint is intrinsically dynamical .",
    "thus @xmath26 depends explicitly on the ( imaginary ) time @xmath27 .",
    "this is different from that in the situation in , e.g. , the slave boson approach for lattice fermions with infinite on - site repulsion in which the no - double - occupancy constraint may also be enforced by a @xmath0-functional @xcite .",
    "the constraint equation there is a constant of motion hence @xmath28 is time independent . because of the local nature of the auxiliary field @xmath1 , the kinetic energy in the last term may not be rearranged into the usual form @xmath29 through partial integration . in the spirit of composite fermion approach ,",
    "we rewrite the action ( [ action0 ] ) in terms of the  transformed fermion fields \" , still denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath25 , such that @xmath31 with @xmath32 -\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{c}\\psi^{\\dagger}(r)\\psi(r )   \\right \\ } \\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is an integer . in the integral of @xmath35",
    ", a gauge fixing procedure is implicitly assumed .",
    "we attached even ( @xmath36 ) flux quanta per fermion through the well - known  chern - simons term \" with statistical gauge field @xmath37 : integrating out the @xmath38-component of @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath39 is a local density . while in the rest of the paper we will mainly focused on the ground state properties , we have formulated our theory within a finite temperature field theory formalism .",
    "similar actions but without the constraint have been investigated in @xcite in the context of anyon superconductivity and in @xcite in a study of the fqhe at finite temperature .",
    "since the ground state of free fermions in a partially filled ll is highly degenerate , it is clearly not suitable for perturbative expansions .",
    "the above gauge transformation is motivated by the desire of finding a suitable mean - field theory which may provide a convenient starting point for approximations . without the constraint and at zero @xmath40 ,",
    "this has been investigated by lopez and fradkin @xcite : consider the homogeneous liquid saddle point solution for the chern - simons field @xmath41 , such that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the average particle density . in this mean - field theory , the single - particle orbitals are described by the lls determined by the effective magnetic field @xmath44 for the filling fraction @xmath20 such that @xmath45 , an integer , @xmath46 , the mean - field theory possesses an incompressible ground state described by @xmath47 filled ( effective ) lls .",
    "the filling fraction @xmath20 which satisfies this condition is precisely the value where the fqhe arises .",
    "however , since this mean - field approximation for the chern - simons statistical gauge field @xmath37 does not depend on the nature of the underlying electronic state ( other than the assumption that it is a homogeneous liquid ) , in the _ unconstrained _ theory this mapping of such a fractionally filled state onto an incompressible state also works ( by which we mean that the mean - field solution exists and is stable against gaussian fluctuations ) for free electrons ! this contradicts with the well known fact that the fqhe is a result of strong electron - electron correlations hence the mapping between the fqh states and the iqh states is sensible only when interactions are present .",
    "this serious deficiency of the unconstrained theory is reflected by the fact that the energy scale describing the fqh states in this theory is given the effective cyclotron energy @xmath48 , which is proportional to the bare cyclotron energy @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "now we consider the homogeneous mean - field solution _ with _ the constraint .",
    "the mean - field theory is obtained by substitutions @xmath50 , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is given by eqn.([mfcs ] ) and @xmath53 is a constant , independent of @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 enforces the lll constraint . in the free electron case ,",
    "the ground state of the mean - field theory for the statistical field ( [ mfcs ] ) is given by the configurations of electrons occupying the effective lls subjected to the constraint @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mean - field cyclotron frequency and @xmath58 is the occupancy of the l - th ll .",
    "consider the example of @xmath59 . in this case @xmath60 , and the mean - field eigenspectrum is given by @xmath61 .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , this ground state is highly degenerate as expected .",
    "thus we see that there is indeed no resemblance of a fractionally filled state to the iqh state for free systems . notice that in this ( non - interacting ) case , the mean - field value for the @xmath1-field @xmath62 is not a stationary point since the free energy is a linear function of @xmath53 .",
    "consider now the interacting case .",
    "as shown in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the treatment of interaction is equivalent to a treatment of the fluctuations in the gauge field @xmath35 because of the condition ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "thus one may write the interaction term in the action ( [ action1 ] ) in terms of the statistical field @xmath35 .",
    "shift @xmath63 so that @xmath37 and @xmath1 represent fluctuations with respect to the saddle point solution , we write the action @xmath64 in the form @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 v(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r } ) [ { \\vec \\nabla } \\times \\vec{a}(r^{\\prime } ) ] \\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 @xmath69 are renormalized mass and renormalized chemical potential respectively .",

    "@xmath53 is determined by the extremal condition @xmath72 without @xmath73 , the mean - field ground state is highly degenerate as discussed above .",
    "following the  composite fermion \" picture @xcite , it is nature to expect that a new stationary point solution , which describes @xmath47 filled ( effective ) lls for the filling fraction @xmath74 , will emerge when the interaction is properly treated .",
    "however , it is a non - trivial task to determine which level of approximations would qualify to be the  proper treatment \" of the interaction . in the present work , we will only examine the single loop quantum corrections described by a gaussian theory .    as the very first step for constructing a loop expansion",
    ", one needs to decide which mean - field state should be taken . based on the above discussion",
    ", we shall assume that fluctuations will shift the non - interacting mean - field ground state to a new one which is non - degenerate and is described by @xmath47 filled effective lls for the filling fractions @xmath8 . with this new mean - field state",
    ", we calculate the ( one ) loop corrections and obtain the physical description of the corresponding fqh state .",
    "the correctness of our assumption will be determined later by a self - consistency requirement . as will be discussed below",
    ", the self - consistency equation may be seen as the equation for the mass renormalization of composite fermions .",
    "the fact that fluctuation corrections may result in a new stationary point state is well documented . for a charged superconductor",
    ", it is known that in certain situations @xcite gauge field fluctuations may shift the order parameter and render the superconducting transition to first order , in contrast to the usual second order phase transition predicted by the ginzburg - landau theory without considering the fluctuations in the electric - magnetic field @xcite . in quantum field theory ,",
    "a similar case is also found in the scalar electrodynamics in four dimension @xcite . in our case , the situation is slightly different since here we postulate the new mean - field solution first , compute the loop corrections with respect to this assumed mean - field solution , and verify the correctness ( i.e. , the existence and the stability of this new solution ) self - consistently by solving the saddle point equation , which is now dressed by loop corrections .",
    "our hope is that the one - loop theory will be sufficient to give the correct physics .",
    "an idea of similar spirit has been proposed previously by weng in his treatment of doped quantum antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "if one ignores the fluctuations in @xmath1 , and considers only the gaussian fluctuations in the statistical field @xmath37 , one would obtain similar results as those of the unconstrained theory @xcite , but with a renormalized mass @xmath75 .",
    "however , this simple minded approach violates kohn s theorem @xcite .",
    "thus it is essential to incorporate the fluctuations in @xmath1 , treat them at the same footing as those in the statistical field @xmath37 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , in a theory without constraint , one may utilize the continuity equation to simplify the calculation of the response kernel through some special choice of gauge . for a system of electrons constrained to the lll , however ,",
    "it is in general not possible to apply such a procedure since in this case the current defined in the usual manner does not satisfy the continuity equation @xcite .",
