    "our results also suggest that moving to the higher center - of - mass energies of rhic and the lhc will not help separate the two competing physics effects .",
    "we showed that radiation lengths in cold nuclear matter for quarks @xmath3 of the order of 50  fm to 100  fm are compatible with the @xmath127  gev fermilab e772/e866 data . the same stopping power of large nuclei",

    "we demonstrated that , with the anticipated statistical accuracy of the data in the large @xmath0 region , radiation lengths as large as 200  fm can be detected .",
    "if @xmath3 is of @xmath128 , there is a good chance that it can be determined with @xmath129 accuracy .    as a final note",
    ", we recognize that experimental measurements may differ from the most sophisticated theoretical predictions . with the next - to - leading order simulation tools at hand , upcoming e906 experimental data can be quickly and reliably analyzed for parton energy loss effects .",
    "the theoretical progress described here , combined with experimental advances in the use of dimuons , is expected to result in the first unambiguous measurement of quark energy loss in nuclei  @xcite and provide the much - needed standard candle for gauging the nuclear response to strongly interacting particles .",

    "<S> we calculate the differential drell - yan production cross section in proton - nucleus collisions by including both next - to - leading order perturbative effects and effects of the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that dilepton production in fixed target experiments is an excellent tool to study initial - state parton energy loss in large nuclei and to accurately determine the stopping power of cold nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we provide theoretical predictions for the attenuation of the drell - yan cross section at large values of feynman @xmath0 and show that for low proton beam energies experimental measurements at fermilab s e906 can clearly distinguish between nuclear shadowing and energy loss effects . if confirmed by data , our results may help determine the quark radiation length in cold nuclear matter @xmath1  m. </S>"
