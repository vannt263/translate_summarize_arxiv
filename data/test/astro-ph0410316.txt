    "there exist few techniques that allow for the measurement of quantities that characterize the magnetic field in molecular clouds . at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths ,",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field is most commonly traced using polarimetry measurements from dust continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field ( in general , its line - of - sight component ) can only be directly measured via the zeeman effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) , usually at longer wavelengths . in order to gather as much information as possible about the magnetic field , the so - called chandrasekhar fermi ( cf ) method @xcite",
    "is often used to infer the strength of the plane - of - the - sky component of the field . because this is achieved with the same polarimetry data that give the orientation of the sky - projected magnetic field , the cf method can act as a bridge between the polarimetry and zeeman observations to provide an estimate for the magnitude of the mean field strength in a given cloud .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how a simple extension of the cf method can be used alone , i.e. , without the need of zeeman data , to infer the magnitude of the magnetic field ; not only the strength of its plane - of - the - sky component .",
    "furthermore , it will also be shown that , contrary to the original cf method which only really works well when the magnetic field is located close enough to the plane of the sky , our generalization is valid regardless of the field s orientation in space . however , this can only be accomplished if and when the spatial orientation of the magnetic field is known .",
    "that is to say , not only the orientation of its projection on the plane of the sky is needed ( from polarimetry ) , but also its inclination to the line of sight .",
    "this last piece of information can be obtained through the technique of @xcite which relies on the availability of spectroscopic measurements from suitable neutral and ionic molecular species , as well as polarimetry .",
    "finally , we apply our extension to the cf method to already published data for the m17 molecular cloud @xcite , and infer a value for the magnitude of the mean magnetic field for this object .",
    "it was originally asserted by @xcite that the amount of dispersion of the polarization angles measured from starlight ( or dust continuum radiation ) can reveal information about the magnitude of the magnetic field . with the assumption that the magnetic field is frozen to the ambient fluid",
    ", any ( turbulent ) motion within the gas in a direction perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic field will be transmitted to , and distort , the field lines .",
    "@xcite further assumed that such disturbances would propagate as waves along the magnetic field lines at the alfvn speed , which they used as the starting point for their analysis .",
    "it follows that since dust grains are thought to be tied to the magnetic field lines @xcite , the amount of distortion in the field lines can be inferred from polarimetry .",
    "similarly , the turbulent motion of the gas can be measured through the spectral line profiles of molecular species , for example .",
    "these two observed quantities are needed to evaluate the strength of the magnetic field through the cf method .",
    "following , therefore , the original derivation of @xcite , we can write an equation for the mean value of the magnetic field @xmath0 as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the mass density and the two - dimensional velocity dispersion ( perpendicular to the field lines ) of the matter coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath4 is the dispersion in angular deviations of the field lines .",
    "equation ( [ eq : cf1 ] ) is valid in the small angle limit .    in their estimation of the magnetic field strength in the spiral arms @xcite ,",
    "identified @xmath4 with the dispersion in the orientation of the polarization vectors measured for distant background stars . using the coordinate system of figure [ cap : coord ] to define the spatial orientation of the magnetic field , with @xmath5 the inclination angle of the field to the line of sight , and @xmath6 the angle made by its projection on the plane of the sky , we find , for the case originally considered by @xcite , that    @xmath7    however , observations of this type probe only one direction in the lateral displacement of the magnetic field line .",
    "we must , therefore , make the following substitution for the velocity dispersion    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the total three - dimensional velocity dispersion of the gas ( for cases of isotropic turbulence ) . inserting equations ( [ eq : sig(b ) ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmas ] ) in equation ( [ eq : cf1 ] ) we obtain the original equation derived by @xcite    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field ( more on this below ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : cf_org ] ) is often used to measure the mean strength of the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field in molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been tested with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations to verify its domain of applicability @xcite .",
    "although the cf method has been found to work well for strong enough magnetic field , it also suffers from some shortcomings . among these , is the fact that the equation ( [ eq : cf_org ] ) only really applies well when the magnetic field is located close enough to the plane of the sky .",
    "in fact , the method will fail when the field is aligned parallel to the line of sight ( @xmath12 in figure [ cap : coord ] )",
    ".      it would be desirable to extend the cf method to cases where the magnetic field is arbitrarily oriented in space .",
    "this , however , requires that observations can be made to measure not only @xmath6 ( the angle made by the projection of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky ) , but also @xmath5 ( the inclination angle of the field to the line of sight ) .",
    "some methods have already been proposed to do such measurements .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) modeled the magnetic field in molecular clouds with uniform and nonuniform components , and through a statistical analysis were able to evaluate the spatial orientation ( i.e. , they inferred @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) for the mean three - dimensional uniform field .",
    "more recently , @xcite have proposed a technique that combines polarimetry and ion - to - neutral line width ratio measurements @xcite to map the spatial orientation of the magnetic field across molecular clouds .",
    "this method has been used so far for three different objects : m17 @xcite , dr 21(oh ) @xcite , and orion a @xcite .",
    "once @xmath5 and @xmath6 are mapped across a given molecular cloud , the angular dispersions @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be calculated from the measured data .",
    "it is easy to show that , in the small angle limit , the total angular dispersion of the magnetic field lines @xmath4 is given by    @xmath15    equation ( [ eq : sigma(phi ) ] ) takes into account not only the inclination of the magnetic field , but also angular deviations along two independent directions perpendicular to the field orientation .",
    "because of this last point , the velocity dispersion will be @xmath16 times larger than what is used in the original cf method equation ( [ eq : cf_org ] ) . that is to say , we will now either use the two - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath3 , define after equation ( [ eq : cf1 ] ) , or its equivalent expressed as a function of @xmath9 if the turbulence is isotropic    @xmath17    using equations ( [ eq : sigma(phi ) ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma(per ) ] ) , we can now write a generalized cf equation from ( [ eq : cf1 ] )    @xmath18^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\label{eq : cf_mod}\\ ] ]    or if the turbulence is isotropic    @xmath19}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\label{eq : cf_iso}\\ ] ]    in both equations ( [ eq : cf_mod ] ) and ( [ eq : cf_iso ] ) we have added a correction factor @xmath20 ( first introduced by @xcite ) to take into account some shortcomings of the cf method to be discussed later .",
    "it is now easy to see how equation ( [ eq : cf_iso ] ) can be reduced to one for the plane - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field @xmath11",
    "( i.e. , equation ( [ eq : cf_org ] ) ) when only polarization measurements are available . in this case , for a sufficiently large set of data we expect ( as long as @xmath21 )    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    we can write    @xmath24    which is the same as equation ( [ eq : cf_org ] ) .    we can , therefore , emphasize two important advantages of the modified cf equation ( [ eq : cf_mod ] ) ( or ( [ eq : cf_iso ] ) ) over the original :    * the new equation is valid no matter what the orientation of the magnetic field is .",
    "most notably , the method does not fail when the field is directed along the line of sight . * finally , the value for the magnetic field calculated with equation ( [ eq : cf_mod ] ) is not that of its plane - of - the - sky component , but that of _ full magnitude of the mean magnetic field vector_.      as mentioned earlier , mhd simulations have already been used in the past @xcite to test the validity of the original cf method ( equation ( [ eq : cf_org ] ) ) .",
    "the main conclusion of these studies was that the introduction of a correction factor ( @xmath20 in equations ( [ eq : cf_mod ] ) and ( [ eq : cf_iso ] ) ) is needed when evaluating @xmath11 .",
    "a correction of @xmath25 was deemed appropriate in most cases when the field is not too weak .",
    "a few reasons are usually identified for this .",
    "for example :    1 .",
    "smoothing of the field : because of the finite resolution with which observations are done , there will be an averaging of the angular structure of the field .",
    "this will bring a decrease of the angular dispersion @xmath4 , and an overestimation of the field strength @xcite .",
    "2 .   similarly ,",
    "line - of - sight averaging ( independent of the angular resolution of the observations ) of the magnetic field will decrease @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneity and complex density structures ( e.g. , clumpiness ) also tend to reduce the value of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we also add to the previous points one more aspect that should be kept in mind when applying the cf method .    in the case of highly turbulent and massive molecular clouds ( like in the example considered in the next section )",
    ", it has been observed that there can exist significant velocity drifts between coexistent neutral and ionic molecular species .",
    "this can be ascertained through the comparison of the observed line profiles for the two types of species , the ions consistently exhibiting narrower spectral line widths @xcite .",
    "this implies that the coupling between ions and neutrals is not perfect @xcite . within the context of the cf method ,",
    "this bring about uncertainties in two of the quantities used when evaluating the magnetic field strength .",
    "indeed , because of this imperfect coupling between ions and neutrals , the mass density @xmath2 used in the cf equation can not be that of ( larger ) neutral density .",
    "it must be somewhat smaller .",
    "furthermore , because of the aforementioned velocity drift , the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the field lines @xmath3 ( or @xmath9 ) can not be that measured for a neutral molecular species",
    ". it must also be smaller .",
    "the combination of these factors will also tend to reduce the value of @xmath20 ( in equations ( [ eq : cf_mod ] ) or ( [ eq : cf_iso ] ) ) , at least when the cf method is applied to highly turbulent and massive molecular clouds .",
    "we leave the quantification of these effects as open questions that could , perhaps , be investigated through simulations .",
    "using their aforementioned technique , @xcite measured the spatial orientation of the magnetic field at 57 different positions across the m17 molecular clouds .",
    "this was accomplished using extensive 350 @xmath26 m dust continuum polarimetry and spectroscopy ( hco@xmath27/hcn ) maps obtained at the caltech submillimeter observatory .",
    "we now use their results to calculate mean magnetic field strength for m17 , using equation ( [ eq : cf_mod ] ) and @xmath6 used here are slightly different from those presented in @xcite .",
    "we use a maximum polarization level of 10% , instead of 7% as was used in their original analysis . see @xcite for more details . ] .",
    "the transverse velocity dispersion was evaluated from the hcn spectra , taking into account the ( anisotropic ) turbulent flow model used by @xcite ( see their figure 2 , and equation ( 11 ) ) , and the fact that the inclination angle is known at each position can be obtained from the corresponding observed spectral line width @xmath29 . it can be shown that @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given in their equation ( 11 ) with @xmath33 . ] . upon using equation ( [ eq : cf_mod ] ) with @xmath34 , an approximate value of @xmath35 @xmath36 for the mean density , and a mean molecular mass of 2.3 , we find      this value for the magnitude of the magnetic field could be further reduced if the correction factor @xmath20 were found to be smaller than the stated value ( because of the effects discussed in section [ sub : coupling ] ) , or again if the average density across the maps were less than what was assumed here . however",
    ", this field strength may not be too excessive in light of the fact that @xcite obtained a peak value of @xmath38 g for the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field in m17 , using hi zeeman measurements .",
    "for , once the inclination angle quoted above is taken into account , we calculate from their data a field magnitude in excess of 1 mg . our molecular species ( i.e. , hcn and hco@xmath27 , in the @xmath39 transition ) probe denser media which could harbor stronger fields",
    ".          finally , we would like to state that the extension to the cf method presented in this paper should be readily testable through mhd simulations , as was done in the past for the original cf technique @xcite .",
