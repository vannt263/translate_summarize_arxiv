    "van der waals forces play a dominant role in the interaction of atoms and molecules with carbon nanostructures at separations larger than about one nanometer .",
    "these forces are of fluctuation nature and are described in second order perturbation theory as a dipole - dipole interaction . theoretical description of the van der waals forces as a quantum phenomenon was pioneered by london .",
    "the general theory of the van der waals forces in the framework of quantum statistical physics was developed by lifshitz @xcite using the concept of a frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity .",
    "lifshitz s theory describes both the interaction between two semispaces or plates of finite thickness separated by a gap and between a microparticle ( an atom or a molecule ) and a flat surface of a macrobody . in the latter case",
    "it is commonly referred to as the casimir - polder force @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of microparticle  nanostructure interaction is of importance for many applications including the problem of hydrogen storage in carbon nanostructures @xcite .",
    "however , the application of the lifshitz theory to the latter case encounters serious problems because the boundary surface of carbon nanotubes is not flat and single - wall nanotubes are not characterized by the macroscopic concept of a frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity .",
    "because of this , most theoretical work on the van der waals interaction in layered structures and between hydrogen atoms ( molecules ) and a graphite sheet or carbon nanotubes was done using the phenomenological density functional theory ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "some other approximate approaches were also used , e.g. , the nonrelativistic perturbation theory for degenerate levels of a two - level atomic system @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that in some cases the approximate and phenomenological approaches do not provide a precise description of the van der waals interaction @xcite .",
    "this is true @xcite , for instance , when one uses the density functional theory ( especially with linear - density approximation ) .",
    "recently , the scope of the lifshitz theory of the van der waals forces was much widened by successful application to the interpretation of precision measurements of the casimir force @xcite ( i.e. , the van der waals force at larger separations where the relativistic retardation becomes essential ) and to atom - wall interaction in connection with bose - einstein condensation @xcite . what is more , in refs .",
    "@xcite the lifshitz theory was extended for the case of an atom ( molecule ) interacting with a plane surface of a uniaxial crystal or with a multi - wall carbon nanotube .",
    "the generalization to nanotubes was achieved by using the proximity force theorem @xcite and the idealization of graphite dielectric permittivities which is applicable to multi - wall nanotubes with sufficiently large number of walls . in ref .",
    "@xcite the lifshitz - type formulas were obtained for the van der waals interaction between a single layer of graphite ( hereafter , graphene ) and a material plate , graphene and an atom or a molecule , and between a single - wall carbon nanotube and a plate . to achieve this goal ,",
    "graphene was considered in terms of a two - dimensional free electron gas @xcite .",
    "the reflection properties of electromagnetic oscillations on graphene were described by the specific boundary conditions imposed on the infinitely thin positively charged plasma sheet , carrying a continuous fluid with some mass and negative charge density @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we use the same model of graphene as in ref .",
    "@xcite and obtain lifshitz - type formulas for the van der waals interaction between a microparticle ( an atom or a molecule ) and a single - wall carbon nanotube . both the free energy and interaction force at arbitrary temperature are considered . as an example , we have calculated the van der waals free energy and force as functions of separation in the configuration of a hydrogen atom and a molecule in close proximity to a single - wall carbon nanotube . specifically , the values of the van der waals coefficient are determined at different separations .",
    "comparison studies of the van der waals interaction of a microparticle with multi- and single - wall carbon nanotubes are performed .",
    "if we consider the van der waals interaction of an atom or a molecule with a nanotube having only two or three walls , the idealization of the dielectric permittivity of graphite is demonstrated to be already applicable if separation distance between a microparticle and a nanotube is sufficiently large .",

    "<S> the lifshitz - type formulas describing the free energy and the force of the van der waals interaction between an atom ( molecule ) and a single - wall carbon nanotube are obtained . </S>",

    "<S> comparison studies of the van der waals interaction of hydrogen atoms with single- and multi - wall carbon nanotubes show that depending on atom - nanotube separation distance the idealization of graphite dielectric permittivity is already applicable to nanotubes with only two or three walls . </S>"
