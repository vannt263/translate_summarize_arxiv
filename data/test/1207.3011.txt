    "at first glance , measuring the vacuum is trivial , a perfect photodetector will reveal the vacuum state upon the non - occurrence of a click .",
    "however , the converse result , i.e. not measuring the vacuum , ideally should preserve the information in the non - vacuum sector for further interrogation - something which is difficult to achieve with direct photodetection .",
    "formally , we would like to implement the following measurement projectors , @xmath0 , where the latter non - vacuum outcome removes the vacuum component without affecting the relative amplitudes or coherences of the other fock states .",
    "this is crucial for sequential measurement schemes , such as in  @xcite , and rules out other projective schemes such as quantum nondemolition measurements of photon number  @xcite .",
    "the development of practical methods for non - destructive measurements on optical fields  @xcite is therefore an important topic for future practical quantum information processing systems .",
    "measurement is also a key element in performing non - gaussian operations , e.g. for entanglement purification of continuous variable states .",
    "recent examples include the implementation of the quantum optical creation and annihilation operators , both of which rely on postselection @xcite .",
    "extending the type of possible operations is crucial for the production of tailored states in quantum information systems .",
    "our method can be simply extended to provide a first realization of the bare photon addition and subtraction operators .",
    "we consider a single mode of an optical cavity in an arbitrary quantum state , @xmath1 , as our system to be measured . to perform the measurement ,",
    "we introduce a probe which consists of a three level atom in the @xmath2-configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lambdaatom]a ) . the cavity mode can be controllably coupled to transition b whereas transition a interacts with an externally applied laser field  @xcite . in these papers",
    "the general adiabatic mapping of atomic levels to cavities was introduced .",
    "our particularly simple configuration is insensitive to all field amplitudes other than the vacuum .",
    "the hamiltonian of the combined system can be written in the rotating wave approximation as @xmath3 where the coupling constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 between the atom and the two fields depend on the strength of the respective fields at the point where the atom is located .",
    "an optional detuning @xmath6 can be applied to both fields in order to suppress single - photon resonance effects as long as we maintain the two - photon resonance condition , @xmath7 the situation is similar to the v - stirap scheme for producing single photons  @xcite where a cavity evolves from @xmath8 through a dark state adiabatic evolution of an atom @xmath9 .    , @xmath10 ) and a single excited level ( @xmath11 ) can be used to probe for the vacuum component of an optical field with annihilation operator @xmath12 .",
    "the a transition is driven by a stirap laser and the b transition can be controllably coupled to the cavity mode to be measured .",

    "b ) counter - intuitive pulse sequence for the couplings . consider the case where there are @xmath14 photons in the field . with the initial state of the combined atom - mode system @xmath15 , coupling a is turned on first . as coupling b",
    "is slowly increased , the atom - cavity state adiabatically follows the dark - state manifold @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "coupling a is now turned off , followed by coupling b , leaving the final state of the system as @xmath18 . if the cavity was originally vacuum ( @xmath19 ) , the final state of the atom remains as @xmath10 . ]    in our measurement procedure , we run the v - stirap sequence in reverse : the initial state of the atom is @xmath10 , and the order of the a and b couplings is switched ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdaatom]b ) .",
    "if the cavity field initially contains at least one photon , at the end of the sequence the atom is left in @xmath13 and the field has one photon subtracted . however , if the cavity was originally in the vacuum state , the atom stays in @xmath10 and the cavity is left unchanged .",
    "an initial superposition of the cavity evolves as @xmath20 the state of the atom is now entangled with that of the cavity . by measuring the atomic state in either @xmath13 or @xmath10 , we have determined whether the initial cavity state had at least one photon or none . by coherent rotations of the ground states before a population measurement , projections onto more general subspaces are also possible .",
    "if the atom is found in @xmath13 , the field amplitudes have been shifted by one .",
    "the ideal projection @xmath21 results if we replace the subtracted photon , this is simply achieved by running the v - stirap procedure forwards .",
    "note that this does not require the initial cavity state to be vacuum , we can add a photon to an arbitrary state of the field .",
    "as discussed later , the shifting property of the procedure can be exploited to perform novel operations and generate non - classical states of light .",
    "the key aspect of the adiabatic process is that the evolution of the system does not rely on the dynamics of the hamiltonian , provided that the conditions of adiabatic transition are satisfied . in this way",
    ", the state of the ancilla atom can be made asymptotically insensitive to the cavity photon number , except for the critical case of the vacuum . in the usual jaynes - cummings scenario ,",
    "the dynamics in each of the combined fock subspaces proceeds at a rate proportional to the square root of photon number , leading in general to different states of the atom . in our scheme",
    ", the atom does not distinguish between different photon numbers @xmath22 , which allows us to perform the ideal projection onto the complement of the vacuum , in contrast to previous proposals for quantum non - demolition measurements of the optical field  @xcite .",
    "we can extend the method to project onto the joint @xmath23-mode vacuum state or complement , as required in the decoding scheme of  @xcite .",

    "we apply in turn the same procedure as for the single mode measurement by sequential pairwise adiabatic variation of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , after which the population of @xmath26 is determined .",
    "if the atom is detected in @xmath26 , then the @xmath23-modes are projected onto the joint vacuum state @xmath36 , otherwise the atom and @xmath23-modes are left in a ( generally entangled ) state where the @xmath37 state has been truncated . to disentangle the atom and add back subtracted photons",
    ", running the sequence of couplings backwards and in reverse order returns the atom to @xmath26 which erases any information of the photon number distribution of the @xmath23-modes .",
    "the experimental setup for v - stirap  @xcite can be adapted to perform our vacuum measurement ( fig.[fig : experiment ] ) .",
    "we use a cavity with a long storage time to reduce leakage and decoherence .",
    "we also introduce preparation and readout zones for the atom .",
    "the motion of the atom is reversed in the case of measuring the atom in @xmath13 in order to replace a subtracted photon .",
    "there are several experimental challenges , mainly the lifetime of the field compared to the time required to implement the measurement .",
    "the cavity field must last long enough for the atom to be adiabatically transported , measured , and returned .",
    "the damping rate of the cavity and atom - cavity coupling are both highly dependent upon the effective mode volume of the cavity and balancing these factors will be system dependent . to give an indication of the performance of the protocol under non - ideal condition , we have simulated the measurement of a lossy cavity with finite sweep times , the results displayed in fig.[fig : decoh ] .",
    "is performed before the atom is transported into the cavity .",
    "after the atom has crossed the cavity and adiabatically interacted with laser and mode , it is measured , e.g. by fluorescence shelving  @xcite or cavity enhanced detection  @xcite , to discover which ground state it is in . to perform the ideal @xmath21 operation in the case of the @xmath13 result , the motion of the atom is reversed in order to replace the photon extracted from the cavity . ]",

    "we can also use the photon number altering properties of our procedure to enact bare raising and lowering operations , in contrast to the creation @xmath40 and annihilation operators @xmath12 as usually considered .",

    "the cavity loss parameter @xmath48 is also plotted relative to @xmath49 . assuming the knowledge of the cavity properties , the fidelity optimizing time of transition was chosen in each data point .",
    "we note that assuming an educated guess for the initial mean photon number of the state , the point of maximum fidelity at a constant loss may be shifted along the @xmath50 axis by altering the intensity of the laser field . ]",
    "however , the @xmath40 and @xmath12 operators do not simply add and subtract photons , but also bose condition the state .",
    "pure addition and subtraction of photons are represented by bare raising and lowering operators  @xcite ( sometimes known as photon number shifting operators  @xcite ) @xmath51 these can produce nonclassical states of light ; for example any state which has @xmath52 applied to it must violate the klyshko criterion  @xcite .",
    "applying @xmath52 to a coherent state produces a state with subpoissonian statistics , whereas applying @xmath53 makes it superpoissonian .",
    "there has been little study of the bare operators and their effects , mainly because they have not been realized experimentally  @xcite .",
    "implementing @xmath52 and @xmath54 requires cancellation of the @xmath55 bose enhancement factors inherent in @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the nature of the @xmath21 projection and the adiabatic process that we have described does not alter the relative weights of the amplitudes corresponding to different photon numbers , in contrast to other schemes which rely on @xmath40 .",
    "the v - stirap process implements @xmath52 and the reverse process realises @xmath58 . in addressing the problem of quantum optical phase the measurement of moments of bare operators",

    "we will explore the detailed consequences of this elsewhere .",
    "we can further exploit the conditional dynamics preserving the relative amplitudes for all non - zero number states to implement a reverse quantum scissors  @xcite . in the original quantum scissors scheme a general superposition of photon numbers has photon numbers higher than 1 removed , without altering the zero and one photon amplitudes .",
    "the scheme has been theoretically extended to make the cut at higher photon numbers @xcite . by successive application of the measurement without photon replacement @xmath23 times",
    ", we can truncate the first @xmath23 amplitudes of a state , conditioned on not observing the vacuum . by adding @xmath23 photons",
    ", we return the state to its original form but without the first @xmath23 terms ( fig.[fig : wigner ] ) .",
    "the probability that this will occur is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the probability of observing @xmath61 photons .",

    "the ability to implement ideal projections on a field opens up new possibilities for quantum communication and computation .",
    "adiabatic evolution in our method avoids the @xmath55 factors in dynamical schemes and achieves the unusual nonlinearity required .",
    "though it will be challenging to engineer systems with the requisite long storage times with strong coupling , recent advances in microcavities as well as microwave and nanomechanical systems give grounds for optimism .",
    "the simplicity and utility of the system described here for implementing several quantum optical information protocols should be significant drivers towards this goal .",
    "to see why the methods works , we examine the form of the rotating - wave hamiltonian for the atom - field system , @xmath70 firstly , we note that for any @xmath71 , the subspace @xmath72 is coupled together by @xmath73 .",
    "other states are not coupled to this triplet , and this simplifies the dynamics significantly .",
    "together with the linear span of the vector @xmath74 , which itself is an eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath75 , these subspaces allow for a decomposition of the whole hilbert space describing the coupled system of the atom and the cavity . within each of the three - dimensional subspaces",
    ", we can identify three nondegenerate eigenenergies : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the eigenstates corresponding to zero energy are , up to normalisation and phase factors , @xmath77 , along with the special case of @xmath74 , noted above .    in order to study the deviations from an ideal adiabatic transition , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation . for a given @xmath23",

    "the equations are best solved in terms of the projective space coordinates @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where they become @xmath90    the last pair of equations can be solved asymptotically . for this purpose , we denote the complete time of transition @xmath91 , such that all of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are upper bounded by a constant multiple of @xmath95 . also , we denote @xmath96 the minimum modulus of the lower of the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath97 ( restricted to the given subspace ) reached during the transition .",
    "this value is also a lower bound for both of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we use these inequalities to find that @xmath100 these formulas allow us to express @xmath101    if the spatial distributions of intensity of the two light modes are smooth functions of coordinates , the time derivative of @xmath102 for both @xmath103 and @xmath104 is zero .",
    "it immediately follows that the relative contributions of the states orthogonal to the desired final state , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - kappa ] ) , vanish at the end of the transition , leaving only the asymptotic term .",
    "the probability of the diabatic transition is in turn @xmath105 and can be pushed arbitrarily close to zero by choosing a sufficiently long time @xmath91 .",
    "the resulting state obtains a phase shift of @xmath106 which itself scales as @xmath107 and also has a limit of zero for @xmath108 .",
    "the dependence of the results on the photon number @xmath23 manifests itself through the constant @xmath109 this formula suggests that the scalings of both the probability of error and the phase @xmath110 are actually the more favourable the higher @xmath23 one operates in .",
    "studying the worst case , i.e. , @xmath111 , we find that the transition is optimal if the two light modes overlap in such a way that the effective beginning or end of either one coincides with the point of maximal intensity of the other one .",
    "we finish the analysis by noting that the state @xmath74 remains unchanged during the whole transition and obtains no phase shift due to the fact that it corresponds to exactly zero energy .    as a result",

    "for the implementation of the measurement , this requires that the system being measured does not significantly evolve over the timescale required to perform the adiabatic evolutions and atomic measurement .",
    "this will be a considerable experimental challenge , though advances in cavity qed have led to high coupling strengths compared to loss rates which are the dominant sources of decoherence .",

    ", the atom must couple strongly with the cavity mode as this will limit the speed of the atomic transport at which adiabaticity can be maintained . together with the low damping rate , we require that the atom - cavity system is within the strong coupling regime .",

    "much higher couplings have been reported for atoms interacting with evanescent field of a toroidal microresonator , of the order of @xmath121  @xcite .      a standard method of state detection is shelving fluorescence .",
    "a long cavity storage time is essential for the measurement as shelving fluorescence takes a finite time , of the order of 100 microseconds for 99.9% fidelity  @xcite due to the need for the atom to absorb and spontaneously emit photons and for these to be detected .",
