    "wave scattering in surface - corrugated guiding systems remains a quite interesting problem , both from the theoretical viewpoint and due to many applications ranging from the sound and electromagnetic propagation , to the conduction of electrons in mesoscopic wires . in spite of many important results obtained to date ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , there is a number of open questions to be resolved .",
    "one of such problems is to understand the interplay between different mechanisms of the scattering that are due to principally different terms in an effective scattering potential constructed with the use of various perturbative approaches .    in the recent papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that apart from the well known terms in the potentials appearing in the first order perturbation theory , one should keep some specific terms that were neglected due to their seeming smallness .",
    "it was demonstrated that these terms , although formally belonging to the second order terms , can play a decisive role in the scattering in some region of parameters .",
    "since these terms are proportional to the square of the derivative of surface profiles , they can be associated with the _ square - gradient scattering _ ( sgs ) mechanism .",
    "in contrast with ref.@xcite where a particular case of one rough surface was considered , below we develop a general approach by concentrating our attention on quasi - one dimensional waveguides with two corrugated surfaces that are either statistically uncorrelated or correlated .",
    "our main interest is in the expression for the _ attenuation length _ @xmath0 ( also known as the scattering length , or the total mean free path ) , corresponding to specific @xmath1-th propagating mode .",
    "we assume that the total number @xmath2 of these modes ( or conducting channels ) is large , @xmath3 , and that the lower and upper surface profiles ( boundaries ) of such quasi-1d waveguides are described by two random functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "in what follows , we consider three configurations of a particular interest :    1 .",
    "the waveguide with the _ uncorrelated _ boundaries , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "2 .   the waveguide with the _ antisymmetric _ boundaries , @xmath6 3 .   the waveguide with the _ symmetric _ boundaries , @xmath7    in our approach we assume that due to the multiple scattering of a travelling wave from the rough boundaries , the longitudinal wave number of an @xmath1-th propagating mode can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is its unperturbed value , @xmath10 the real part @xmath11 is responsible for a roughness - induced correction to the phase velocity of a given mode . as is known , the shift @xmath11 does not change the transport properties of a disordered system . therefore",
    ", our further analysis shall be focused on the attenuation length @xmath0 only .    in order to properly take into account the surface irregularities we use the approach developed in ref .",
    "specifically , by means of the canonical transformation we formally reduce the problem of the _ surface _ scattering to the _ bulk _ one described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 , @xmath13 with the effective potential @xmath14 .",
    "it should be stressed that such a transformation does not mean an equivalence between the surface and bulk scattering .",
    "the very point is that the obtained `` bulk '' hamiltonian @xmath12 is of very specific form that does not allow to use standard random matrix approaches based on a complete randomness in effective potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - problem ] we start with the general expressions describing the waveguide with any form of rough boundaries . in sec .",

    "[ sec - num - analysis ] we report the data that illustrates our analytical results and make clear the role of various terms in the expression for the scattering potential . in this section",
    "we also discuss the so - called `` repulsion '' phenomenon discovered in ref .",

    "a brief comparison of the three configurations , as well as our concluding remarks , are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we derive the general expressions describing quasi-1d waveguides with any type of the boundaries .",
    "then , we present them in the form , most suitable for our analysis of three particular waveguide configurations .    specifically , we consider the standard model of an open waveguide of the average width @xmath15 , stretched along the @xmath16 axis . the lower and upper surfaces of the waveguide are assumed to be described , respectively , by the profiles @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "here @xmath19 is the root - mean - square roughness height that is assumed to be identical for both boundaries . in other words ,",

    "one can observe a strong similarity of the inverse attenuation length behavior for all configurations considered .",
