    "the measurements of photon structure functions have a long tradition since the first of such measurements was performed by the pluto collaboration in 1981 . the investigations concern the qed structure of the photon as well as the hadronic structure . for the hadronic structure function",
    "the main areas of interest are the behavior at low values of @xmath2 and the evolution with the momentum scale , which is predicted by qcd to be logarithmic .",
    "the experimental information is dominated by the results from the four lep experiments .",
    "this review is based on earlier work  @xcite and as an extension provides a number of updated figures , together with a comparison of the experimental data with new parametrisations of that became available since then .",
    "only results on the structure of quasi - real photons are discussed here .",
    "the structure of virtual photons and the corresponding measurements of effective structure functions are detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the photon can fluctuate into a fermion  anti - fermion state consistent with the quantum numbers of the photon and within the limitations set by the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "these fluctuations are favored , i.e.  have the longest lifetimes , for high energetic photons of low virtuality .",
    "if such a fluctuation of the photon is probed , the photon reveals its structure .        using this feature , measurements of photon structure functions",
    "are obtained from the differential cross - section of the deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering process sketched in figure  [ fig : fig01 ] . in this process",
    "the structure of the quasi - real photon , @xmath3 , radiated off an electron from one beam is probed by the virtual photon , @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 is radiated off an electron from the other beam such that this electron is deflected into the detector .",
    "the detailed formalism for the scattering of photons of arbitrary virtualities can be found in  @xcite . for deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering on quasi - real photons",
    "the equation reduces to the well known formula : @xmath5   \\mbox {      with :     }   x = \\frac{q^{2}}{p^{2}+q^{2}+w^{2 } } \\ ] ] the absolute values of the four momentum squared of the virtual and quasi - real photons are denoted and , with @xmath6 .",
    "the symbols @xmath2 and @xmath7 denote the usual dimensionless variables of deep - inelastic scattering , @xmath8 denotes the invariant mass of the final state excluding the electrons , and @xmath9 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the flux of the incoming photons , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fraction of the electron energy carried by the photon , is usually taken from the equivalent photon approximation , epa . at leading order ,",
    "the structure function is proportional to the parton content , @xmath12 , of the photon , and therefore reveals the structure of the photon . in the region of small",
    "@xmath7 studied , @xmath13 , the contribution of the term containing is small , and is usually neglected .",
    "the qed structure function of the photon is measured from deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering events in which a pair of muons is produced by the @xmath14 system .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig02 ] shows the present world data on this measurement .",
    "an update is expected when the ongoing l3 analysis  @xcite is finalized .",
    "the data span a range of about two orders of magnitude in and have a precision down to about 5@xmath15 . with this precision ,",
    "the treatment of the small but non - zero virtuality of the quasi - real photon is important , as are electroweak radiative corrections to the deep inelastically scattered electron .",
    "unfortunately , the treatment of these corrections is different for the various experiments , see  @xcite for details .",
    "in addition to the measurements of further structure functions  @xcite have been obtained by analyzing the azimuthal correlation between the scattering plane of the deep inelastically scattered electron and the plane spanned by the muon pair .",
    "good agreement between data and predictions has been found .",
    "also the scattering of two highly virtual photons has been analyzed , and an indirect evidence for the presence of interference terms has been found  @xcite . both these measurements are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "apart from shining light on the qed structure of the photon the determination of the qed structure functions of the photon serves two experimental purposes .",
    "it is a test bed for preparing the tools for the measurements of , and it sets the limit of precision that could possibly be obtained in the more complex case of hadronic final states .",
    "the measurement of the hadronic structure of the photon is hampered by the fact that for measuring @xmath2 , the invariant mass w of the hadronic final state has to be reconstructed .",
    "this is because the energy of the incoming quasi - real photon is not known , and consequently , reconstruction of @xmath2 from the deep - inelastically scattered electron alone is impossible .",
    "since the hadronic state is not perfectly described by the available monte carlo models , and part of the final state hadrons are scattered into the forward regions of the detectors which are only equipped with electromagnetic calorimeters , or even outside of the detector acceptance , the precision with which @xmath2 can be obtained is limited , especially at large values of @xmath8 and correspondingly low values of @xmath2 . at large values of the value of @xmath2",
    "is determined much more precisely , and also the data are much better described by the monte carlo models .",
    "the problems at low values of @xmath2 are partly overcome by sophisticated unfolding techniques , and by constraining the monte carlo models by utilizing combined lep data on the hadronic final state  @xcite .",
    "still the monte carlo description at low values of @xmath2 is one of the dominant uncertainties in this measurement , such that some lep experiments even refrained from assigning an error due to this model dependence , but published results for individual models instead .",
    "scale.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]     scale .",
    "]    there is one important difference between the structure function @xmath16 of the proton and of the photon , which originates in the different evolution equations the two have to obey .",
    "whereas @xmath16 results from a solution of a homogeneous evolution equation , the photon structure function follows an inhomogeneous evolution equation , and therefore receives two contributions .",
    "these are frequently called the hadron - like component , stemming from the general solution of the homogeneous evolution equation as for @xmath16 , and the point - like component , resulting from a specific solution of the inhomogeneous evolution equation .",
    "this results in different scaling violations of @xmath16 and .",
    "the present status of the measurements of is shown in figures  [ fig : fig03 ] and  [ fig : fig04 ] .",
    "starting from the data used in  @xcite the tpc/2@xmath3 results are dropped .",
    "this is due to their unusual shape as a function of @xmath2 for low values of , and consequently very bad @xmath17 values wrt .",
    "several parametrisations of , see tables 4 and 5 in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , all preliminary and not yet published lep data have been excluded , and the newly published data from aleph  @xcite and l3  @xcite have been added .",
    "the data span a region in from 1.9780  and in @xmath2 from 0.00250.98 .",
    "the experimental precision is clearly dominated by the results from the lep experiments .",
    "there is a nice consistency between the results obtained at lep1 energies ( open symbols ) with the ones from lep2 energy data ( filled symbols ) , which at the same illuminate different detector parts .",
    "the higher order parametrisation from the grv group  @xcite , which has been obtained before many of the shown datasets became available , still gives a fair description of the data .",
    "since the end of lep there has been quite some effort made in obtaining new parametrisations of by several groups of authors , namely cjk  @xcite , afg  @xcite and sal  @xcite .",
    "some important ingredients of the various theoretical analyses are given below , for further details the reader is referred to the original publications .     and",
    "@xmath18 .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   and @xmath18 .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath19 .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   and @xmath19 .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the cjk parametrisation is based on all available data for @xmath20  including the tpc/2@xmath3 data and the preliminary delphi data taken at lep1 energies .",
    "various ways of treating the heavy quark , i.e.  @xmath21 , contributions are explored by the cjk group , leading to various parametrisations .",
    "the parametrisation used in this review is the cjk nlo model , which is based on the acot(@xmath22 ) variable - flavor number scheme .",
    "for brevity , it is denoted by cjk(ho ) .",
    "the parametrisation is evaluated in the dis@xmath23 factorization scheme , the starting scale of the evolution as obtained from the fits is @xmath24  , and the strong coupling constant , @xmath25 , uses @xmath26  mev .",
    "the afg(ho ) parametrisation is based on a subset of data , namely lep1 data at medium , including the preliminary delphi data .",
    "the heavy quarks are taken to be massless , however , @xmath27 corrections to the direct component of are included in the calculation .",
    "the afg(ho ) parametrisation is evaluated in the factorization scheme , the starting scale for the evolution is @xmath28  , again as obtained from the fit , and @xmath29  mev is used .",
    "finally , the sal(ho ) parametrisation is based on a completely different theoretical concept , namely the assumption of the gribov factorization , which relates the total @xmath30 cross - section to the total @xmath31 and @xmath32 cross - sections . at small values of @xmath2 the following relation between the proton and photon structure functions is obtained : @xmath33 , where the numerical value stems from the donnachie - landshoff parametrisation of the total cross - sections at large values of @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , the input data of used , i.e.  all published data except the tpc/2@xmath3 data , are augmented by the zeus @xmath16 results at @xmath34 and @xmath35  . in the few overlapping regions the @xmath16 data are much more precise than the corresponding data .",
    "in addition the @xmath16 results extend to much lower values of @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath16 data determine the low-@xmath2 behavior of .",
    "in addition , in an attempt to better constrain the gluon distribution of the photon , also zeus di - jet data measured in photo - production events are used .",
    "however , it turns out that in the present kinematical region of the data the sensitivity to the gluon from the photon is rather limited .",
    "the data are strongly dominated by contributions of quarks from the photon , while the fraction of events originating from gluons from the photon is very small .",
    "the relative division of data used for the fit for /@xmath16/di - jet is about 7/5/1 .",
    "for the treatment of heavy quarks the sal group derives an interpolation between the fixed flavor number scheme at low values of and the zero - mass variable flavor number scheme at high values of .",
    "the sal(ho ) parametrisation is evaluated in the dis@xmath23 factorization scheme , the starting scale of the evolution is chosen to be @xmath36  , and @xmath25 uses @xmath37  mev .    despite their rather different theoretical framework",
    "all groups face a common difficulty , they have problems fitting the preliminary delphi data taken at lep1 and/or lep2 energies . finally , this results in an inflation of the experimental error , or even in exclusion of this data .",
    "the fact that all parametrisations are based on different theoretical prejudice and use different experimental input to their fits makes it even more interesting to compare their behavior to the experimental data .",
    "this comparison can be seen in figures  [ fig : fig05 ] and  [ fig : fig06 ] for a number of values spanning almost the entire experimental range of the lep data .",
    "the data shown at @xmath38  were partly used , ( + ) , in the respective fit , and partly not , ( - ) , where the corresponding patterns are for cjk(ho ) :  ( + /-/+/+ ) , for afg(ho ) :  ( + /-/-/- ) and finally for sal(ho ) :  ( + /-/+/+ ) .        amongst the three new parametrisations cjk(ho ) exhibits the steepest slope at low values of @xmath2 , with increasing differences to the other parametrisations for increasing values . at medium values of @xmath2",
    "the parametrisations are closer to each other , and at high values the differences increase again , with the afg(ho ) parametrisation always yielding the lowest prediction . for comparison ,",
    "the old grv prediction generally lies in the middle of the new predictions , but for the lowest @xmath2 values at @xmath39  .",
    "overall there is good agreement of the new parametrisations with the data at @xmath40  given the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the largest differences are seen for the data at @xmath41  , which have not been used by any of the fits and which have rather small uncertainties assigned . here",
    "the most notable difference to the data is at low values of @xmath2 when compared to the cjk(ho ) prediction , which is significantly higher than the data .",
    "not only the inclusive structure function has been obtained experimentally , but also its charm component , , has been measured  @xcite .",
    "the charm part has been identified from the inclusive data by selecting charmed d mesons .",
    "the analysis makes use of the small phase space of the pion in the decay @xmath42 , which leads to a peaking structure in the distribution of the mass difference of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 mesons . the result for in two bins of @xmath2 and unfolded to @xmath45  is shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] in comparison to several theoretical predictions . shown are the purely perturbative calculations from  @xcite at leading and next - to - leading order , nlo , and for the two data bins of @xmath2 .",
    "this clearly shows that nlo corrections to are small .",
    "in addition shown is the functional form of the leading order grs  @xcite parametrisation for both the full and the point - like part alone .",
    "the separation in @xmath2 of the data has been such as to experimentally separate the point - like part , concentrated at large values of @xmath2 , from the hadron - like part , dominating at low values of @xmath2 , as can be seen e.g.  by comparing to the grs curves .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig7 ] demonstrates that the high @xmath2 region is adequately described by the point - like nlo prediction with only @xmath25 and the mass of the charm - quark , @xmath46 , as free parameters .",
    "the behavior at low values of @xmath2 is experimentally less well constrained .",
    "however , it can not be accommodated by the point - like part alone , e.g.  as given by the grs parametrisation , thereby suggesting a non - vanishing hadron - like part at low values of @xmath2 also for .",
    "the uncertainty on the measurement at low values of @xmath2 is relatively big , but largely dominated by statistical uncertainties ( inner error bars ) , so a measurement of by the other lep experiments is highly desirable .",
    "( left ) , and prospects for a measurement of the evolution of at an ilc ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   ( left ) , and prospects for a measurement of the evolution of at an ilc ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    one key feature of is the logarithmic behavior with as predicted by perturbative qcd .",
    "it is the point - like contribution discussed above that results in positive scaling violations of for all values of @xmath2 , in contrast to the proton , which exhibits negative scaling violations at high values of @xmath2 , due to gluon radiation , and positive scaling violations at low values of @xmath2 , due to pair creation of quark  anti - quark pairs .",
    "see  @xcite for a detailed assessment of this issue .",
    "the positive scaling violations of for all values of @xmath2 is born out by the data as can be seen from figure  [ fig : fig08](left ) .",
    "the data are displayed as a function of in bins of @xmath2 , where each data point is shown at its nearest average @xmath2 value chosen from the list on the left .",
    "in addition , for better visibility , the data points for the various bins in @xmath2 are separated by constant offsets , n. linear fits to the data of the form @xmath47 have been performed .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath48 are significantly above zero for all bins of @xmath2 , and a clear trend for increasing slope with increasing values of @xmath2 is observed .",
    "what about the future of after lep .",
    "there are two obvious candidates for future measurements , a short term opportunity is the measurement at the b - factories , where the babar and belle experiments are operating .",
    "the longer term option is the measurement of at an international linear collider , ilc .",
    "the general prospects for two - photon physics at an ilc can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the higher beam energy and luminosity available at the ilc compared to lep will allow to extend the available phase in by about two orders in magnitude .",
    "for a detailed investigation of neutral current interactions see  @xcite . as an example",
    ", the measurement of the evolution of at medium values of @xmath2 at an @xmath49 collider is shown in figure  [ fig : fig08](right ) . at the ilc also",
    "novel features can be investigated like the measurement of the flavor decomposition of by exploring the exchange of @xmath8 and @xmath50 bosons  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of photon structure functions is an interesting field of research .",
    "unfortunately , experimentally it has come to a halt after the shut - down of lep , since so far it has not been pursued at the b - factories and the prospects for an ilc are still uncertain .    up to now , a wealth of data has been analyzed both in terms of the qed structure , and for the hadronic structure of the photon . in this short review",
    "only a part of the investigations could be discussed in detail . concerning the qed structure , was investigated , as well as additional structure functions from azimuthal correlations and the interactions of two virtual photons . for the hadronic structure the emphasis is on and especially its behavior at low values of @xmath2 and the logarithmic scaling violations with .",
    "in addition , the charm contribution has been measured , and the interaction of two virtual photons were investigated .",
    "i strongly hope that the future will bring us additional information from the b - factories and an ilc .",
