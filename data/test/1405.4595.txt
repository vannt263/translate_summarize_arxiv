    "the large scale homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime are two fundamental tenets underpinning modern cosmology .",
    "the assertion that spacetime , when averaged over sufficiently large length scales , can be described in terms of an flrw metric and a system of perfect fluids has proved to be extremely successful ; the standard @xmath1cdm model fits all current cosmological data sets satisfactorily ( although certain curiosities remain , see @xcite ) .",
    "isotropy on large scales is strongly supported by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , specifically in the uniformity of the distance to last scattering on the sky @xcite .",
    "similarly current galaxy surveys have been shown to approach a homogeneous distribution when averaged over sufficiently large volumes @xcite .    despite the formidable success of the standard model , there remain unresolved issues .",
    "perhaps the most interesting are the cmb anomalies detected on large scales @xcite , in particular a deficiency of large angle correlations .",
    "it is not simply the lack of correlation on large scales that is of interest .",
    "measurements of the cmb quadrupole and octopoles show an alignment approximately perpendicular to the ecliptic plane @xcite",
    ". such violations of isotropy persist to smaller scales @xmath2 .",
    "the statistical significance of these observations has been widely debated in the literature , since most constitute an _ a posteriori _",
    "search for anomalies in the data , which in turn is thought to be a single realisation of a gaussian and isotropic distribution .",
    "the large scale nature of these deviations from isotropy could suggest a cosmological origin .",
    "if this were the case , then one might expect to observe a similar signal in other cosmological data sets @xcite . in this work we attempt to quantify the extent to which current large scale structure ( lss ) data sets are consistent with the underlying assumptions of isotropy and homogeneity .",
    "curiosities have already been observed in the local galaxy distribution , not least recent work @xcite ( see also related earlier works @xcite ) which indicates that the local luminosity density is systematically lower than expected , out to co - moving distances @xmath3 .    in this work ,",
    "we analyse the local galaxy distribution using the 2mass extended source catalogue @xcite , using the photometric redshift data developed recently in @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are provided in the 2mass catalogue for @xmath4 galaxies to limiting magnitude @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the k - band magnitude ; this sample has a mean redshift of approximately @xmath7 .",
    "using photometric redshift data for the full extended source galaxy catalog allows us to probe a considerably deeper volume - the mean redshift of a sample cut at @xmath8 is approximately @xmath9 respectively .",
    "however the gain in volume is offset by the increased uncertainties associated with photometric redshift data .",
    "using a full sky galaxy survey allows us to examine the angular distribution of galaxies on the sky , and the volume probed in the full 2mass catalogue allows us to make magnitude cuts to test the redshift distribution . in what follows",
    "we build a picture of the three dimensional galaxy distribution using the luminosity function .",
    "we are specifically interested in the existence of preferred directions in the data , which are indicative of a breakdown of statistical isotropy .",
    "we analyse the galaxy distribution in disjoint patches in the sky , using a combination of parametric and non - parametric methods to reconstruct the luminosity function .",
    "the shape of the luminosity function in different regions of the sky provides us with a test of the isotropy of the local universe .",
    "the paper will proceed as follows .",
    "we outline the method we use to construct the luminosity function in section [ sec:2 ] . in [ sec:3 ]",
    "we describe the data set used and discuss our choice of quality cuts .",
    "our results are presented in section [ sec:4 ] , along with a discussion of our error analysis .",
    "we highlight some of the limitations of our method and conclude in section [ sec:5 ] . unless otherwise stated , throughout this work we use cosmological parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and take @xmath12 .",
    "the aim of this work is to determine the angular dependence of the local galaxy distribution .",
    "to do so , we calculate the luminosity function @xmath13 , the number of galaxies per unit luminosity @xmath14 per unit volume @xcite . to obtain the luminosity function , one can use either parametric or non - parametric methods . the overwhelmingly favoured parametric form used in the literature",
    "is the schechter function @xcite    @xmath15 { dl \\over l^{*}}\\ ] ]    which contains three parameters - the density normalisation ( @xmath16 ) , the power law slope at low @xmath14 ( @xmath17 ) and the typical luminosity at the knee of the function ( @xmath18 ) . the expression ( @xmath19 ) is more commonly written in terms of absolute magnitude @xmath20 via the relation    @xmath21    yielding    @xmath22 \\phi^ { * } 10^{0.4(1+\\alpha)(m - m^ { * } ) } \\exp\\left [ -10^{0.4(m - m^{*})}\\right ] dm\\ ] ]    for the survey that we use , each galaxy is characterized by a photometric ( or spectroscopic for a small subset ) redshift and three apparent magnitude measurements , made in the @xmath23 bands .",
    "we utilize the @xmath6 band in what follows , specifically taking the @xmath24 @xmath25 isophotal fiducial elliptical aperture magnitudes . for a galaxy with redshift and apparent magnitude @xmath26",
    ", we convert from apparent to absolute magnitude @xmath27 using    @xmath28 - 25 + k(z_{\\rm i},k_{\\rm s , i},j_{\\rm i } ) + e(z)\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the k - correction for the galaxy - which accounts for the effect of redshift on the bandpass transmission curve .",
    "we follow @xcite to construct this function , using the following approximate fitting form    @xmath30    where the @xmath31 coefficients are given in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an online calculator was created to accurately calculate the k - corrections for a number of surveys - we use the 2mass @xmath6 correction with color @xmath32 in what follows .",
    "we repeated our analysis using a simple ansatz @xmath33 $ ] for the k - correction @xcite , and found no significant effect on our results .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the form of the k - correction at low redshifts is nearly independent of the galaxy type .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the k - correction specified by ( @xmath34 ) is consistent with more rigorous calculations to within @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we adopt a simple ansatz @xmath36 with @xmath37 to describe the redshift evolution .    to fit the model parameters @xmath38 , one must use a maximum likelihood estimation technique ( the so called sty method @xcite ) .",
    "if we have a sample of @xmath39 galaxies in a magnitude limited survey , then the probability that the @xmath40 galaxy has luminosity @xmath27 given it is located at redshift @xmath41 is given by @xcite    @xmath42    where @xmath43 are the maximum and minimum absolute magnitudes at redshift @xmath41 that could be detected in the magnitude limited sample .",
    "the likelihood    @xmath44    is then maximized for the parameters @xmath45 . as each individual probability @xmath46",
    "is given by a ratio of the luminosity function and its integral over an absolute magnitude range , the normalization @xmath16 drops out of the calculation when using this method .",
    "the schechter function has been shown to be a relatively poor fit the observed galaxy distribution - it has been argued @xcite that it falls off too sharply at the bright end and hence fails to simultaneously fit both the bright and faint tails .",
    "care must therefore be taken that any anisotropic signal that we detect is not spurious , due to the functional form chosen yielding a better or worse fit in different patches of the sky .    with this in mind , we also attempt to reconstruct the luminosity function using a non - parametric technique .",
    "numerous methods have been developed for this purpose - we direct the interested reader to @xcite for a review . here",
    "we adopt the stepwise maximum likelihood method introduced by efstathiou - ellis - peterson ( eep ) @xcite .",
    "the eep method estimates the binned luminosity function    @xmath47    with window function    @xmath48    and we take @xmath49 magnitude bins .",
    "the likelihood function is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the width of the magnitude bins ( here we adopt constant spacing ) , @xmath52 is the maximum absolute magnitude that can be detected at redshift @xmath53 given the magnitude limits of the survey , and    @xmath54    to obtain the luminosity function , we minimize ( @xmath55 ) with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "it can be shown that the problem reduces to solving the equation    @xmath57    which can be solved by iteration . as an initial guess",
    ", we use the schechter function with best fit parameters estimated using the sty method .",
    "we have tested that the choice of initial guess has no effect on the shape of the final binned luminosity function .",
    "both the non - parametric eep and parametric sty methods yield no information regarding the overall density of the galaxy distribution , as both involve ratios of the luminosity function resulting in estimates that are invariant under amplitude shifts",
    ". however , in this work we are purely interested in the the shape of the luminosity function , which we use as a test of the statistical isotropy of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the normalisation @xmath58 will give us information regarding the homogeneity of the low redshift data - local fluctuations will have the effect of shifting the amplitude of @xmath59 in different patches with respect to one another .",
    "estimates of the amplitude typically depend on the volume of the sample , and hence are strongly sensitive to photometric redshift uncertainties .",
    "large errors in the normalisation @xmath58 would lessen the significance of any anisotropic signal detected .",
    "in a companion paper , we explore the homogeneity of the local galaxy distribution by using a series of non - parametric estimators to calculate the galaxy density as a function of magnitude cut . for the purposes of this work , we focus on the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "in this work we exclusively use the 2mass all sky extended source catalogue ( xsc ) @xcite .",
    "2mass is an all sky , near - infrared survey that scanned more than @xmath60 of the sky during its four year operation .",
    "the resulting catalog contains more than 400 million point and 1.6 million extended sources - in the latter case the majority are extra - galactic .",
    "the measurements were performed over three bands - @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with the signal to noise limit @xmath64 being met by objects brighter ( or of equal brightness ) than @xmath65 in the @xmath6 band .",
    "the reliability of the survey is greater than @xmath66 in regions @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the galactic latitude .",
    "the photometry in the north and south galactic plane is highly symmetric , with a mean color difference of less than @xmath69 .    in what follows we use the newly constructed 2mass xsc photometric redshift",
    "catalog - 2mpz - constructed in @xcite .",
    "we sketch the catalog here , interested readers should consult @xcite for further details .",
    "the full xsc catalog contains @xmath70 objects , however before use we must remove a small number due to measurement errors and the existence of artifacts . after removing artifacts , non - extended galactic sources , extreme @xmath71 measurements and those objects lacking measurements in the @xmath72 bands , one arrives at the ` 2mass good ' sample with @xmath73 entries .",
    "the @xmath71 @xmath24 @xmath25 isophotal magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction with the standard sfd maps @xcite , with coefficients @xmath74 taken from @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts were given in cases where known , either from the 2mass redshift catalog with spectroscopic redshift data provided to limiting magnitude @xmath5 , or from other publicly available data sets ( specifically sloan digital sky survey data release 9 , 6df galaxy survey data release 3 , 2df galaxy redshift survey and the zcat compilation using the cfa redshift catalog @xcite ) .",
    "approximately one third of the galaxies in the 2mpz catalog have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the remaining galaxies are assigned photometric redshifts using a machine learning technique @xcite , which is based upon an empirical relation between galaxy magnitudes and redshifts obtained using the spectroscopic redshift subsample as a training set .",
    "other methods , such as template ( spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ) fitting @xcite , are also powerful tools to infer photometric redshift information . however , such methods are not appropriate for the 2mpz catalog as the supercosmos magnitudes are obtained from photographic plates and are not easily calibrated to the same system as 2mass and wise .",
    "the potentially problematic photometric calibrations only apply to the supercosmos optical data , and could be translated into a small offset in photometric redshifts ( although the effect is expected to be negligible ) .",
    "no such issues occur for the 2mass k - band photometry that we use in this work .",
    "the 2mpz catalog was constructed using the publicly available annz package - for a description of the algorithm adopted we direct interested readers to @xcite .",
    "when testing the isotropy and homogeneity of the galactic distribution , one typically requires a complete and uniform sample over the survey volume under consideration - for this reason one must apply a magnitude cut to the 2mass data .",
    "we adopt a slightly conservative cut of @xmath75 band to ensure completeness over @xmath76 of the sky ( excluding the galactic bulge ) .",
    "@xmath77 galaxies remain in the sample with this cut . for the purposes of our analysis",
    ", we also cut the region @xmath78 from the sky .",
    "this is principally to avoid stellar contamination , which has been reported at lower galactic latitudes @xcite . in fig.[fig:1 ] we exhibit the cross correlation of the xsc with the 2mass point source catalog ( psc ) for galactic cut @xmath79 - we find the cross correlation to be completely sub - dominant compared to the auto - correlation ( shown in black ) .",
    "the error bars are obtained via jack knife re - sampling .    in fig.[fig:2 ] we exhibit the galaxy distribution as a function of redshift for a number of @xmath6 cuts .",
    "the mean redshift of the survey is given by @xmath80 for @xmath81 respectively .",
    "to assess the effect of photometric redshift uncertainties on the shape of the luminosity function , we construct @xmath82 realisations of the galaxy catalog and repeat our analysis .",
    "the mocks are constructed using the following algorithm .    in each patch of the sky ,",
    "we bin the galaxies into @xmath83 magnitude bins between @xmath84 - each bin contains @xmath85 galaxies , with @xmath86 . for a single realisation , each magnitude bin",
    "is then assigned @xmath87 galaxies , where @xmath88 is drawn from a poisson distribution of mean @xmath85 .",
    "these galaxies are assigned redshifts and @xmath6-band magnitudes @xmath89 , drawn with replacement from the original @xmath85 galaxies in that bin .",
    "if the drawn galaxy has a quoted spectroscopic redshift @xmath90 in the catalog , then we simply assign the new data point this value - @xmath91 .",
    "if the drawn galaxy only has a photometric redshift associated with it , then we must infer its true ( spectroscopic ) value .    to estimate the spectroscopic redshift of a galaxy , we extract the subset of galaxies in the catalog that have both photometric @xmath92 and spectroscopic @xmath90 redshifts .",
    "we bin this sub - sample in @xmath93 _ photometric _ redshift bins , with limits chosen such that each bin has an equal number of galaxies . in each bin",
    ", we construct an empirical probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath94",
    ". then the ` true ' spectroscopic redshift of a galaxy with only photometric redshift information is drawn from these pdf s .",
    "once we have inferred @xmath90 , we then calculate the data point s new absolute magnitude according to ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the primary purpose of this work is to locate and quantify any directional dependence in the local matter distribution .",
    "the theoretical tool that we use for this purpose is the luminosity function described in section [ sec:2 ] . to achieve our aim",
    "we decompose the sky into four distinct and orthogonal patches on the sky , centered at galactic coordinates @xmath96 .",
    "we name these a , b , c , d respectively in what follows .",
    "patch a and b have centers in the vicinity of the cmb dipole , and patches c and d were chosen such that they are perpendicular to patches a and b and maximally distant from our galactic latitude cut .",
    "the fractional area of patches a and b on the unit sphere is @xmath97 , and patches c and d have a larger value @xmath98 by virtue of their distance from the galactic cut @xmath99 .",
    "here @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the area on the unit sphere that any given patch would cover .",
    "we note that the decision to make patches a , c and b , d different area on the sky was a conscious one by the authors - it is our intention to show that the results obtained here are independent of the patch size and number of galaxies .",
    "we consider only galaxies with @xmath102 , and @xmath103 - the number of galaxies in each patch with @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 for a - d respectively .",
    "we cut all galaxies with @xmath106 from our sample .",
    "this removes objects for which the peculiar velocity is a dominant contributor to the redshift .",
    "it also removes extremely local features in the galaxy distribution . patches a and c ( b and d )",
    "are located in the north ( south ) galactic plane . in fig.[fig : ait ] we exhibit the four patches in galactic coordinates .",
    "we also highlight the regions of highest galactic density as red dots , and the positions of the largest superclusters in the sample as black squares ( we also exhibit the approximate location of these superclusters in table [ tab : super ] ) .",
    "we calculate the luminosity function in these four patches , searching for statistically significant deviations in the shape of @xmath107 .",
    "detailed studies of the local luminosity function have long established that the universe is under - dense at distances @xmath3 @xcite . in a follow up paper",
    "we assess the homogeneity of the local universe using this galaxy sample , building upon recent studies of low redshift homogeneity @xcite .",
    "however in this work we wish to quantify the statistical isotropy of the distribution .",
    ".the largest superclusters detected in the 2mass sample , exhibited in fig.[fig : ait ] as black squares .",
    "the superclusters are extended objects and we quote their approximate positions only .",
    "the abell and ursa major superclusters are also present in the red sample of fig.[fig : ait ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for large magnitude cut @xmath108 we have a sufficiently large number of galaxies that we can further decompose the sky .",
    "we therefore create @xmath109 equal area patches according to the healpix , @xmath110 scheme .",
    "each patch has area @xmath111 and contains order @xmath112 galaxies with @xmath108 . in each patch",
    "we create @xmath82 realisations using the same procedure adopted previously . once again",
    ", in each magnitude bin we again calculate the probability distribution for @xmath56 and calculate the average @xmath113 per bin .",
    "now the indices @xmath114 run over the @xmath115 pixels that lie above our magnitude cut @xmath99 .    for each patch @xmath116",
    ", we calculate the @xmath113 value for the remaining @xmath117 pixels with @xmath118 .",
    "we search for correlations between @xmath113 and the distance on the unit sphere between patches @xmath116 and @xmath119 , which we denote @xmath120 . a signal of statistical anisotropy - specifically a dipole - would manifest itself as a negative correlation between @xmath113 and @xmath120 .",
    "we quantify the degree of correlation between the two variables via the correlation coefficient    @xmath121    where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the average values of these quantities calculated for all @xmath124 pixels with respect to pixel @xmath119 ( with @xmath125 ) . in fig.[fig : the ] we exhibit the @xmath113 values as a function of @xmath126 for the pixel with the maximum @xmath127 value .",
    "the pixel @xmath119 has @xmath128 and is located at @xmath129 in galactic coordinates .",
    "one can clearly see that while none of the @xmath113 values individually exhibit strong statistical evidence for anisotropy - @xmath130 in all cases - there is a consistent trend of smaller @xmath113 values for larger distances between the patches .",
    "this indicates weak evidence for a dipole in the shape of the luminosity function , in the direction @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the direction of this dipole is qualitatively consistent with that found in previous works @xcite .    as an additional check that no anisotropic biases appear in the galaxy distribution due to different photometric calibrations in the equatorial plane",
    ", we also calculate the @xmath113 and @xmath133 values for the patch on the sky whose center lies closest to the equatorial north pole . labeling this pixel as @xmath134",
    ", we exhibit @xmath135 between this patch and the remaining @xmath136 pixels in fig.[fig : equ ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient for this pixel is lower , @xmath137 , which indicates only very weak evidence for an anti - correlation between @xmath135 and @xmath138 .",
    "none of the @xmath135 values are individually significant .",
    "we can conclude that the different photometric calibration in the north / south equatorial regions do not give rise to any statistically significant anisotropy .",
    "in this work we have studied the properties of the local universe using low redshift galaxy data . in doing so , we have found that there is some evidence that the shape of the luminosity function is asymmetric on the sky , with a dichotomy in the north / south galactic plane . when constructing the luminosity function using a parametric estimator , the parameters dictating the shape of the luminosity function exhibit systematically lower values in the north galactic plane .",
    "however , by utilising a non - parametric estimator to reconstruct the binned luminosity function , we have found that there is no statistically significant evidence for anisotropy when we account for photometric redshift uncertainty .",
    "the individual @xmath139-values obtained between any two patches on the sky indicate no evidence for a directional dependence of the shape of the luminosity function . however",
    ", we do observe some suggestion of a dipole in the north / south galactic plane , with a maximal signal at galactic coordinates @xmath0 ( or equivalently @xmath140 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with existing works @xcite , which use a different method to estimate the anisotropy in the local number counts .",
    "our results are furthermore in agreement with @xcite , in which the local bulk velocity @xmath141 was probed by calculating the effect of @xmath141 on the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the authors were able to reconstruct the magnitude and direction of @xmath141 using galaxies from the sdss data release 7 @xcite , finding @xmath142 and @xmath143 in redshift bins @xmath144 and @xmath145 , with direction @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "similarly , we only find an anisotropic signal when using our largest magnitude cut @xmath104 ( corresponding to a higher redshift sample @xmath148 ) and a direction that is consistent within the errors quoted .",
    "since we do not attempt to model the effect of @xmath141 on the luminosity function explicitly , we can make no claim as to the magnitude of @xmath149 using our method , which should be interpreted as a null test of the isotropic hypothesis .",
    "we expect that using future spectroscopic data will allow us to increase the statistical significance of our finding .",
    "the lack of ` true ' redshifts for a large fraction of our galaxy sample forced us to construct a distribution of possible luminosity functions , based on realisations in which we inferred the spectroscopic redshifts from probability distribution functions of @xmath150 obtained from the data .",
    "the photometric redshift errors are the overwhelmingly dominant source of uncertainty in our calculation and increasing the number of spectroscopic redshifts available will have the effect of narrowing the luminosity function distributions , leading to increased sensitivity of @xmath151 to anisotropy .",
    "we note that related work has studied the effect of photometric redshift uncertainty on estimations of the luminosity function - see for example @xcite .",
    "if our result is taken in conjuncture with other recent work @xcite , it is clear that there is some evidence that the local distribution of galaxies is neither homogeneous or isotropic .",
    "however , the extent to which this conclusion will impact cosmological observables is not clear .",
    "a detailed study of this question will remain for future work .",
    "it is also of considerable interest to test the consistency of the luminosity function in different regions of the sky using data sets that can probe a larger cosmological volume .",
    "certainly , testing the scale at which the luminosity density convergences to its homogeneous asymptote remains a subject of considerable interest .",

    "<S> we test the isotropy of the local distribution of galaxies using the 2mass extended source catalogue . by decomposing the full sky survey into distinct patches and using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic redshift data , we use both parametric and non - parametric methods to obtain the shape of the luminosity function in each patch . </S>",
