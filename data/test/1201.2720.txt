    "distance determinations to galaxies are key to many areas of study in extragalactic astronomy , but remain problematic .",
    "the potential for systematic errors lingers above much of the work , particularly at the accuracy level of a percent or less currently desired ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "these concerns can be addressed through cross calibration among techniques that have independent challenges .",
    "for example , one estimator might have a hidden dependence on metallicity , another might be more susceptible to internal extinction .",
    "one state - of - the - art recent study compares distances obtained using sn ia and cepheid variable stars in the same galaxies @xcite to claim a distance calibration precision of a few percent .",
    "such cases , where one has distance measurements from a variety of methods for a specific galaxy , are rare for two reasons . first ,",
    "because distance estimators are often related to distinct stellar populations , they are not often found within the same stellar system .",
    "the classic example is the dichotomy between the galactic environments of rr lyrae and cepheids @xcite .",
    "second , and currently most relevant , is that several factors conspire to limit estimators to distinct distance regimes .",
    "cepheid observations , like those of rr lyrae , eclipsing binaries and the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , require observations that resolve the stellar populations of the system and are therefore limited to relatively nearby galaxies , even when using the high angular resolution provided by the _ hubble space telescope_. on the other hand , sn ia , due to their rarity , tend to be found in more distant galaxies simply because of the gain in search volume with increasing distance .",
    "these effects make it quite difficult to compare the results among certain classes of distance estimators .",
    "the @xcite study cited above , which is among the most extensive and complete , is based on only eight galaxies with both cepheid and sn ia measurements .",
    "one solution to this limitation relies on identifying a distance estimator that can be applied to _ all _ galaxies , near and far , early or late type , giant or dwarf . even if such an estimator has a large intrinsic distance uncertainty for any individual galaxy , and",
    "so is not ultimately superior to the other estimators , the gains reaped by being able to compare the relative precision and accuracy of the preferred estimators over many tens , if not hundreds of galaxies , is critical .",
    "distance determinations from scaling relations , such as tully - fisher @xcite or fundamental plane @xcite , span the range of distances probed by many methods and so provide a fiducial against which different distance estimators can be compared .",
    "their shortcoming is that they are each applicable to different , narrow classes of galaxies , limited in type and luminosity , and therefore do not resolve the entire problem .    in a series of papers , we have presented a new scaling relation that is applicable to _ all _ galaxies , regardless of luminosity or morphological class @xcite .",
    "this relation , termed the fundamental manifold ( fm ) in reference to its most direct antecedent , the fundamental plane , presents an opportunity to uncover hidden systematic differences among the current set of distance estimators .",
    "here we use existing data , distances from the ned 1-d database and photometry and kinematics compiled within the hyperleda database @xcite , to test this basic idea . neither the data , due to their inhomogeneity , nor the sample , due to the intractable selection criteria , are optimal for precise cross - calibration of distance estimators and eventual application to related problems , such as the measurement of h@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the results presented here should be viewed as only illustrative of what an optimized treatment using the fm could yield . in ",
    "2 we discuss our selection of the sample , in  3 we present the results of this comparison among distance estimators , illustrate how the fm can be used to trace potential internal systematic dependencies , and reverse the calibration and use the fm to obtain distances and estimate @xmath3 . in ",
    "4 we summarize our results .",
    "we utilize the ned 1-d database , which is a compilation of published distances from a wide ranging set of methods . without prejudice for or against any of the entries in the database , we calculate the weighted average ( weighting inversely by the quoted uncertainty and neglecting the measurement if no uncertainty is given ) for each of the distance estimators , for each galaxy .",
    "we require at least two measurements using a particular method to calculate a mean distance measurement for a given galaxy .",
    "there are 1153 galaxies for which we retrieve a distance using at least one of the methods we are comparing . in figure",
    "[ fig : distances ] we show how distance estimators are often effectively constrained to distinct distance ranges .",
    "more critically , the distribution of objects with sn ia distance measurements overlaps very little with the other methods , limiting the number of systems that can be used to directly check for potential systematic errors in the cosmologically - critical ia distances .      to obtain the structural parameters necessary to place a galaxy on the fm",
    ", we search the hyperleda database @xcite , which provides morphologies , kinematic measurements , magnitudes and structural parameters , the latter two based on the work of @xcite , for those galaxies for which we obtained distances from ned 1-d . for the rotation measurements , we adopt the homogenized values provided in hyperleda , which include an inclination correction .",
    "we calculate weighted averages of both the stellar rotation and velocity dispersion measurements where available , and only accept values only if there are at least two measurements of either quantity , and if either the rotation or dispersion is larger than 10 km sec@xmath4 , to avoid the systems with the largest fractional uncertainties . for the morphologies , we average t - types using uniform weights and require a minimum of only one measurement .",
    "the photometric parameters are taken from the archival b - band data , which is the most prevalent .",
    "there are various reasons ( star formation , extinction ) to use redder - band photometry , and we will discuss results using the available i - band data . in the future , we will use the s@xmath5 g database @xcite to obtain photometric parameters at 3.6@xmath6 m , which appear to significantly reduce the scatter in scaling relations @xcite .",
    "the distribution of morphologies , for the subsample of galaxies for which morphologies are catalogued , is shown in figure [ fig : morphs ] .",
    "again , we find that certain distance estimators are limited in their coverage , making comparison on an object - by - object basis difficult .",
    "there are 343 galaxies with both distance measurements and the necessary data to place them on the fm .    for a subset of the data",
    ", we also obtain an optical color , @xmath7 , from the rc3 catalog @xcite to investigate the role of color , and , by inference , of differences in the stellar mass - to - light ratio , on a galaxy s deviation from the fm .",
    "we use observed magnitudes rather than k - corrected rest - frame magnitudes , because , despite the large range in distance of the ned 1-d sample , those galaxies with _ all _ of the necessary data lie at @xmath8 6000 km sec@xmath4 .",
    "one evident avenue for progress is obtaining these data for a larger fraction of the galaxies with sn ia distances , and thereby also extending the sample to greater distances .",
    "our compilation of the available data is presented in table [ tab : data ] ( complete table available electronically ) .",

    "the fm has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite , but , in summary , it is derived from the virial theorem with the additional information that the mass - to - light ratio within @xmath10 , @xmath11 , can be either 1 ) measured independently ( e.g. , via strong gravitational lensing ) or 2 ) estimated using an empirical function of the internal kinematics , @xmath12 , and the surface brightness within @xmath10 , @xmath13 . in the latter case , we have found that the structural differences ( spatial and kinematic ) among galaxies , other than those captured in the variations in @xmath11 , are insignificant given the observational errors ( @xmath14 dex ) .",
    "the fm is a conceptually simpler scaling relation than either tully - fisher ( tf ) or fundamental plane ( fp ) in that it can be expressed independent of wavelength and has only a zero point term to calibrate ( rather than slope in tf or",
    " tilt \" in fp ) : @xmath15 where @xmath12 is expressed as the combination of pressure ( @xmath16 ) and rotational support ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is expected to lie between 2 and 3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , and @xmath20 is a constant that is effectively the zero point of the fm distance estimator . with measurements ( or estimates ) of all terms on the right hand side of the equation ,",
    "one solves for @xmath10 , which , in concert with the angular measurement of @xmath10 , provides the distance .",
    "because we generally lack independent estimates of @xmath11 , we use the empirical relationship for @xmath21 derived from existing data @xcite .",
    "use of the empirical relationship reintroduces wavelength dependences and additional complexity ( analogous to fp  tilt \" ) , but the fm still retains the advantage over previous scaling relations in that it is applicable to all galaxies .    as with any empirical relationship , the relationship changes slightly depending on the data used to define it , and",
    "uncertainties in the fitting function ultimately translate to systematic uncertainties in the distances estimated using the fm .",
    "consequently , comparing fm distances to those obtained using other distance estimators provides a test of both the fm and the independent distance estimators .",
    "comparisons of the fm and multiple independent methods will allow us to distinguish between systematic problems in the fm versus problems with the inditvidual independent estimators . here",
    "we choose to define the fitting function using only the spheroidal galaxies in the original data @xcite , which are expected to have minimal stellar mass - to - light ratio variations .",
    "we exclude globular clusters and ultracompact dwarfs , whose nature is still controversial ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that extend the fm beyond the @xmath10 range needed for this work . although changes in the fitting function for @xmath11 will affect the results , the fitting function is most constrained in exactly the parameter range most relevant here  that of disk and spheroid galaxies with luminosities around @xmath22 .",
    "the functional form we use is @xmath23 this equation provides an estimate of @xmath11 in the i - band .",
    "there are two related , but distinct , questions that will be addressed in the following section : how much does the use of b - band magnitudes increase the scatter ( there would be no increase if all galaxies had the same @xmath24 color ) and how much scatter is introduced in the @xmath25-band @xmath11 by differences in stellar populations ?",
    "to test each distance method , we use the distances provided by ned 1-d to calculate the physical value of @xmath10 and then place the galaxy on the fm . in our original work , from which we take our fitting function for @xmath11 , we used simple hubble flow distances with an adopted hubble parameter .",
    "any difference between the true hubble parameter and that adopted previously will affect the calibration of @xmath11 and @xmath20 , manifesting itself as a zero point shift ( _ i.e. _ , as a change in @xmath20 ) .",
    "we therefore have freedom to adjust the zero point of the fm as needed ( see below for our treatment of this ) and so our discussion here focuses on relative differences between distance estimators rather than on an absolute calibration .",
    "one consideration before proceeding with our comparison of distance estimators and the fm is that of the appropriate choice of @xmath19 in the definition of @xmath12 . in previous work we adopted @xmath26 , as also done by others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , reasonable models suggest that values between 2 and 3 are plausible ( see * ? ? ? * ) . because @xmath27 maps onto morphological type , and morphological type maps onto color , which is presumably related to the stellar mass - to - light ratio , there is the potential to misidentify a relationship between the fm residual ( the deviation of a galaxy from the fm ) and @xmath19 , with one that is truly due to color ( or vice - versa ) . without the proper choice of @xmath19 and some means of avoiding differences in stellar mass - to - light ratios beyond those included in the empirical calibration of @xmath11",
    ", there will be systematic differences when comparing distances to early and late type galaxies .",
    "we will mitigate this difficulty by 1 ) proceeding to optimize our choice of @xmath19 , 2 ) removing any residual correlation between fm residuals and color , and 3 ) providing comparisons among galaxies of similar morphological type .",
    "there is indeed a strong correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath27 ( a spearman rank correlation test for our sample puts the probability of it arising at random at @xmath29 ) . as such , for the purpose of constraining @xmath19 we work with a subsample for which @xmath27 is independent of color ( figure [ fig : colsel ] ) ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( the probability of the correlation arising randomly for this sample is 0.79 ) .",
    "this particular part of the analysis , the derivation of @xmath19 , is restricted to early type galaxies because @xmath16 is generally not available for disk galaxies . as a result",
    ", the galaxies in figure [ fig : colsel ] are naturally restricted to fairly red colors .",
    "if a hidden correlation remains , we expect some of that to influence the best fit value of @xmath19 , again because @xmath32 is expected to correlate with color , and eventually to lead potentially to differences between fm residuals and morphological type .    for this subsample",
    ", we calculate the root mean square ( rms ) residual about the fm ( allowing the zero point to float ) and identify the value of @xmath19 that minimizes the rms ( @xmath33 ; see figure [ fig : minalpha ] ) .",
    "reassuringly , this value lies within the theoretically plausible range and we adopt this value of @xmath19 for the remainder of this study .",
    "however , this calculation is unfortunately quite sensitive to the selected subsample .",
    "for example , if we select galaxies that have @xmath34 ( instead of 0.85 ) , then the minimum rms residual occurs at @xmath35 ( although a correlation between color and @xmath27 still exists at @xmath36 confidence for this sample and so this sample is not preferred ) .",
    "the robustness of the @xmath19 determination needs to be improved both by obtaining a larger sample of galaxies and by performing this analysis with photometry in a filter band that is less sensitive to morphological type ( and , by relation , to color ) .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath19 is principally to alter the relative offset between early and late type galaxies relative to the fm ( see  4 ) , but does not affect the conclusions presented in  5 .",
    "any remaining systematic behavior of the fm residuals will point to new phenomenon , including systematic errors in distance estimators .",
    "we begin by examining the dependence of fm residual to color ( figure [ fig : color ] ) .",
    "the data show a trend of residual with color .",
    "it is not surprising that the early - types have near zero mean residual , because the fm relationship we use was defined using spheroidal galaxies ( from a different sample based on a range of sources , see @xcite , but early - types nonetheless ) . neither the sense nor the magnitude of the trend is necessarily straightforward to explain .",
    "there is an expectation of a trend with color because the stellar mass - to - light ratio will change with color .",
    "however , other factors change as well . for example",
    ", the gas mass fraction of a galaxy correlates with color and that mass is unaccounted for in the empirical derivation of @xmath11 because we used only spheroidal systems .",
    "we use the mean relationship , shown as the line , to correct all of our data ( and so subsequently restrict ourselves to systems with available color measurements ) .",
    "if a particular estimator ( including the fm ) has a systematic error that depends on galaxy type ( color ) , it will contaminate this plot . as with many of the issues raised , we expect this problem to be mitigated using redder photometry , but proceed nonetheless with the data currently available . recall that our expression for @xmath11 provides an estimate of the total @xmath37band mass - to - light ratio within @xmath10 , even though we are using @xmath38band magnitudes .",
    "this means that there are two potential sources of scatter introduced by stellar population differences .",
    "first , there is the possibility of large variations in @xmath24 within the sample that then introduce scatter because we implicitly assume a constant @xmath24 color ( solar ) when converting @xmath39-band luminosity into the corresponding mass in solar masses .",
    "second , scatter can arise from stellar population differences and the associated variations in the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we show , in figure [ fig : bmi ] , the distribution of @xmath24 colors for our galaxy sample , and note that a large fraction of the galaxies are fairly well constrained to colors that vary by about 0.3 mag ( a constant difference from solar color is not a cause for concern because we eventually renormalize the entire relation using the sbf distances ) .",
    "more importantly , this range of colors produces small scatter ( 0.046 dex ) in @xmath11 between the values calculated using the @xmath39-band magnitudes ( and the color correction described above ) and the @xmath25-band magnitudes ( with a color correction derived for the @xmath25-band ) .",
    "we conclude that variations in @xmath24 colors , beyond those that we remove using a mean trend of fm residual with @xmath28 , are a minor contributor to the scatter we observe in the fm ( @xmath40 dex for these data ) .",
    "our @xmath28 color correction is intended to empirically remove such a correlation , although as hinted at previously , this correction may be removing other factors as well that work in parallel to stellar population differences . in figure",
    "[ fig : color ] we plot the expected variation in stellar mass - to - light ratio vs. @xmath41 from @xcite , selecting one particular model ( closed box , scaled salpeter imf ) , demonstrating that the effect we are removing is indeed of the same scale as that expected from stellar population variations .",
    "finally , we estimate the degree to which going to even redder passbands might reduce the scatter , when one does not have a color measurement . for the same stellar population model as in figure [ fig : color ] , the slope in the logarithmic relation between @xmath41 and the stellar mass - to - light ratio at @xmath42 is about half that in @xmath25 . therefore ,",
    "if the scatter in the fm is dominated by stellar population differences , and we do not have colors , we still expect to reduce the scatter by two simply by observing at @xmath42 .",
    "further gains are possible if extinction is important @xcite .",
    "if other causes , not related to the photometric passband , contribute comparably to the scatter , or if we can partially account for stellar population differences , then we expect less than a factor of two improvement by going into the infrared .",
    "for example , the scatter in our @xmath39-band fm is the same as in our @xmath25-band fm ( @xmath14 dex ) , because we have accounted for the stellar population differences at @xmath39 .",
    "the key to interpreting our results is to determine whether multiple estimators show the same systematic behavior in fm residuals , in which case the problem is most likely to lie with the fm or the various corrections we have implemented , or if the fm residuals are peculiar for specific estimators , in which case the fault lies with that particular estimator . on the other hand ,",
    "if none of the estimators exhibit systematic problems relative to the fm , then we will conclude that the estimators and the fm are accurate distance estimators to at least within the quoted uncertainties .",
    "our aim is to test a variety of popular distance estimators to determine which , if any , may lead to distance estimates with systematic errors . using the fm as a reference , we now compare estimators that we could not previously test against each other . to do this",
    ", we plot the galaxies on the fm using the mean distances drawn from the ned 1-d data ( figure [ fig : comp1 ] ) .",
    "normalization or slope errors for any particular estimator will suggest that there is a problem with that estimator . on the other hand ,",
    "if the normalization or slope errors appear endemic , then the problem will lie with the fm .    for each distance estimator with more than 10 galaxies with all the necessary data , we present the results , showing the pressure supported systems , which have velocity dispersions and sometimes also have stellar rotation values , @xmath17(upper panels in the figure ) , and the purely rotationally supported galaxies , which have no quoted stellar velocity dispersion and for which we adopt the width as a measure of @xmath17 ( lower panels ) . in general , if there is a stellar velocity dispersion measurement , the galaxy is a pressure supported systems ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "within each panel we also color - code based on morphology , dividing the early and late type galaxies at a t - type of 1 .",
    "we have set the zero point of the fm , @xmath20 , using the results from the pressure - supported , sbf sample , which is our largest subsample of galaxies and also predominantly consists of early - type galaxies , which will be less susceptible to extinction and stellar population variations .",
    "a cursory examination of the panels shows that there are no disastrous problems with any of the distance estimators as applied to any of the galaxy subsamples , even though some perform better than others ( either in terms of zero point or scatter ) .",
    "there are a few individual galaxy outliers , although it is often the same galaxy that is an outlier in multiple panels because distances are available from multiple estimators , suggesting that fault lies not with the distance estimate but rather with one of the other parameters that enters the fm .",
    "ngc 4704 , which has an unusually large residual in the sn ia panel , is removed from subsequent analysis of the sn ia distance estimator . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] we show the results for galaxies that have distances measured using eclipsing binaries , rr lyrae , and masers .    in figure [",
    "fig : comp3 ] we compare the mean residual and the uncertainty in the mean between the various distance methods , for pressure and rotationally supported galaxies ( the values are given in table [ tab : comp ] ) .",
    "the agreement is strikingly good , with the possible exception of results obtained using the  other \" methods , although there the uncertainty is large because of the small number of galaxies in that category .",
    "none of the differences are statistically significant , but the magnitude of differences is in the range that is potentially important for distance estimators ( @xmath1 few to tens of % ) .",
    "for example , the difference in zero points obtained using the trgb and sn ia methods and pressure supported galaxies is 0.062 , which corresponds to an inferred distance difference of 15% .",
    "unfortunately , for the purpose of identifying if there are any real discrepancies at the target level of a few percent , the error bars are still somewhat too large due to the large amount of scatter in the fm ( arising from the heterogeneous b - band data ) and small sample size ( as many galaxies lack the full set of measurements needed to calculate the fm ) .",

    "the small sample sizes can be addressed relatively easily .",

    "the fm scatter can be improved by going to redder pass - bands .",
    "if all of the data had uncertainties similar to the pressure - supported , sbf measurements , we would easily confirm or refute the level of discrepancy among distance estimators found here .",
    "the fm is not only of use in uncovering systematic differences among distance estimators , but is also potentially useful in uncovering systematic errors in any particular distance estimators within a set of galaxies .",

    "* for discussions of the effects on cepheids and sne ia , respectively ) .",

    "visually , two of the panels appear to show a trend of increasing fm residual with decreasing luminosity ( sbf and sn ia )",
    ". however , this similarity among panels overstates the concordance because some of the galaxies , particularly at the bright end , appear in multiple panels . in table",
    "[ tab : metallicity ] , we present measurements of the relationship between the fm residuals and absolute magnitude for each distance estimator .",
    "we list both the fit obtained using all of the galaxies and after trimming the poorly populated faint end of the galaxy distribution ( either at @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) .",

    "our best fit for the sn ia in galaxies with @xmath57 implies a distance offset of @xmath68 dex/[o / h ] ( for the 4.5 mag/[o / h ] relation of @xcite ) , which agrees with the sense found by @xcite and @xcite in that one would underestimate the distance to sne in more metal rich galaxies , because sne are intrinsically more luminous after light curve correction .",
    "it is difficult to quantitatively compare our results to those of @xcite for various reasons , including their use of stellar masses vs. our use of luminosities and our calibration to gas - phase abundances .",
    "however , they find distance modulus variations that correspond to about 0.15 over the 1 order of magnitude in mass .",
    "if we assume that the order of magnitude in mass correspond to the same magnitude range in luminosity , then we would predict a distance effect of 0.23 dex over the corresponding range , which in turn results in a change of @xmath69 in distance modulus .",
    "this is a much larger value than that found by @xcite , but the discrepancy is not significantly dramatic given our large uncertainties .",
    "likewise , our value expressed in dex/[o / h ] is larger than that found by @xcite ( @xmath70 ) , but again the discrepancy is @xmath71 .",
    "for cepheids , we find no significant correlation , but our measurement ( @xmath72 dex / mag or @xmath73 dex/[o / h ] if the correlation arises from metallicity ) can be compared to previous determinations . given the large uncertainties , this result agrees with previous values , which generally range between @xmath74 and @xmath75 dex/[o / h ] @xcite .      in figure [",

    "are suboptimal for such a experiment , but we proceed nonetheless .    using the fm now for all of the galaxies in the sample , we estimate a distance to each , and show the relationship between recessional velocity and distance in figure [ fig : hubble ] .",

    "the estimate of the systematic uncertainty does not include a variety of potential problems that are ignored here ( modeling of bulk flows , internal extinction corrections , adjustment for potential biases in the galaxy sample , etc . ) .",
    "therefore , while we treat this result cautiously , we present it to show 1 ) the level of precision possible with plausible sample sizes and 2 ) to illustrate how one could determine @xmath3 in a way that utilizes as many ( or as few ) different distance estimators as desired",
    ".    one of those sources of uncertainty , internal extinction , can be mitigated by going to the infrared , as shown most recently by @xcite for _ spitzer _ wavelengths where the scatter about the tully - fisher relation is reduced from 0.43 in the extinction - corrected @xmath38band data to 0.31 in the non - extinction - corrected 3.6@xmath6 m data .",
    "we expect analogous gains in the fm for galaxies in which internal extinction is important .",
    "depending on the fraction of galaxies in a sample for which extinction contributes significantly to the observed fm scatter , proportional gains in the determination of @xmath3 will follow .",
    "we demonstrate that the fundamental manifold ( fm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a fiducial against which any set of distance estimators can be compared .",
    "many , if not most , galaxies will only ever have distances measured with one method , making it impossible to use them to test distance estimators directly .",
    "the fm fiducial , a benchmark for all distance estimators , constrains whether systematic errors exist among estimators and whether they are creeping into even a single estimator as a function of external parameters , such as metallicity .",
    "large sample size is critical for examining selection effects where , for example , one might want to split the sample in various ways ( _ e.g. , _ with environment , luminosity , morphological type , star formation rate ) .    among the distance estimators we examine ( sn ia , cepheids , surface brightness fluctuations , the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch , circumnuclear masers , eclipsing binaries , rr lyrae stars , and the planetary nebulae luminosity functions )",
    ", we find no statistically significant differences ( @xmath81 ) , but caution that differences that are unacceptably large for state - of - the - art distance uncertainties ( @xmath1 few % ) are still allowed by our data .",
    "the lack of precision with which we could discriminate among methods is rooted in sample size , which in certain cases is still too small , and in the less - than - optimal data available ( @xmath39 band and heterogeneous ) .",
    "both of these problems will be resolved with a feasible dedication of resources .",
    "we illustrate the use of the fm distances to 1 ) test the metallicity sensitivity of different estimators , confirming the sn ia distance dependence on host galaxy metallicity and 2 ) provide an alternative calibration of @xmath3 that replaces the classical ladder approach in the use of extragalactic distance estimators with one that utilizes data over a wide range of distances simultaneously .",
