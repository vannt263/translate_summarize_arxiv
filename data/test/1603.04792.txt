    "ever since databases have been able to store basket data , many techniques have been proposed to extract useful insights for analysts .",
    "one of the first , association rule mining  @xcite , also remains one of the most intuitive .",
    "association rules are often used to summarize consumer trends in a transaction set or as input to a classifier  @xcite .",
    "the problem is the very high number of rules , typically in the order of millions . that is exacerbated by the lack of thorough studies of which of the many interestingness measures for ranking rules  @xcite is most appropriate for which application domain .",
    "we present , a framework to compare the outcome of different interestingness measures applied to association rules generated in the food retail domain .",
    "relies on a flexible architecture and on  @xcite , our parallel and distributed pattern mining algorithm that runs on mapreduce .",
    "the use of real datasets and a close collaboration with experienced domain experts from intermarch , one of the largest retailers in france , has led us to selecting the most relevant measures to rank association rules in the food retail domain .",
    "our dataset contains @xmath0 million receipts from stores in all of france , gathered over one year , 2013 .",
    "mining this data results in a huge number of rules .",
    "for example , using a minimum support of mines frequent rules of the form _ customer segment _",
    "_ product category_. out of these , have a confidence of @xmath2 or higher .",
    "table  [ tab : eyecatcher ] shows a ranking of the top-10 rules according to 3 different interestingness measures proposed in  @xcite .",
    "if we denote rules as @xmath3 , _ confidence _ is the probability to observe @xmath4 given that we observed @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "_ piatetsky - shapiro _",
    "@xcite combines how @xmath5 and @xmath4 occur together with how they would if they were independent , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "_ pearson s _ @xmath8 , measures how unlikely observations of @xmath5 and @xmath4 are independent .",
    "this very small example already shows that these measures result in different rule rankings .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]      +",
    "we now report the results of a user study with domain experts from intermarch .",
    "the goal of this study is to assess the ability of interestingness measures to rank association rules according to the needs of an analyst . as explained in section  [ sec : xp : empirical ] , we identified 6 families of measures , and selected a representative of each group for the user study ( table  [ tab : groupsummary ] ) .",
    "we rely on the expertise of our industrial partner to determine , for each analysis scenario , which family produces the most interesting results .",
    "this experiment involved 2 experienced analysts from the marketing department of intermarch .",
    "we setup and let analysts select targets multiple times in order to populate the web application s database with association rules ( section  [ sec : exploitation ] ) .",
    "we let our analysts interact with without any time restriction , and collect their feedback in a free text form .",
    "each analyst firstly has to pick a mining scenario among ` demo_assoc ` , ` prod_assoc_t ` , or ` prod_assoc_c ` .",
    "then she picks a target category or a target product in the taxonomy . in ` prod_assoc_t `  and ` prod_assoc_c ` , she also has the option to filter out rules whose antecedent products are not from the same category as the target .",
    "finally , she chooses one of our 6 ranking measures to sort association rules .",
    "neither the name of the measure nor its computed values for association rules are revealed , because we wanted analysts to evaluate rankings without knowing how they were produced .",
    "resulting association rules are ranked according to a selected measure .",
    "each rule is displayed with its support , confidence and recall , such that analysts can evaluate it at a glance .",
    "for each scenario , our analysts are asked which representative measure highlights the most interesting results ( as detailed below , in all cases a few of them were chosen ) .",
    "once the analyst selects a target , _ all _ matching rules are returned .",
    "the initial motivation of this choice was to determine how many results are worth displaying and are actually examined by the analysts . according to the follow - up interview with the analysts , they carefully considered the first ten results , and screened up to a hundred more .",
    "interestingly , analysts mentioned that they also scrolled down to the bottom of the list in order to see which customer segments are not akin to buying the selected category .",
    "for example , when browsing demographic association rules , they expected to find \\{_50 - 64 _ } @xmath1 _ pet food _ among top results , but also expected \\{_<35 , paris _ } @xmath1 _ pet food _ among bottom results .",
    "this confirms that all rules should remain accessible .",
    "this also indicates that while interestingness measures favor strong associations , it would also be interesting to highlight _",
    "anti_-rules , as those can also convey useful information .",
    "we let marketing experts explore all 3 scenarios and express their preference towards groups of measures .",
    "in the ` demo_assoc`case , @xmath9 and @xmath10 were both highly appreciated .",
    "@xmath9 favors rules such as @xmath11 oise@xmath12 _ flat and carbonated drinks_. these rules are very specific and thus have a very high confidence ( 31,58 % in this particular case ) .",
    "however , this comes at the cost of recall ( 0,08 % ) .",
    "experts value _ confidence _ much more than _ recall _ , as their priority is finding rules that they consider reliable .",
    "a low support is not necessarily an issue , and can lead to the discovery of surprising niche rules that can be exploited nonetheless . as discussed in section  [ sec : annotation ] , @xmath10 offers a more balanced trade - off between confidence and recall , and prioritizes rules such as @xmath13 < 35 , * , * @xmath12 _ baby food _ ( confidence 8,57 % , recall 37,61% ) .",
    "these rules are interesting because they capture a large fraction of the sales of a given category , but are less reliable and generally less surprising . @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 were considered as less interesting than @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "their results offer similar trade - offs , but with lower confidence each time .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 were considered unusable because of their very low confidence .    when experimenting with ` prod_assoc `",
    ", we observed a slightly different behavior . by default , the analysts favored @xmath9 and @xmath14 because of the confidence of their results .",
    "then , we offered the analysts the possibility of filtering the rules to only keep the ones in which the antecedent contains products from the same category as the target .",
    "this led to analysts favoring @xmath10 and @xmath16 .",
    "this difference is caused by an important but implicit criterion : the ability of a measure to filter out very popular products .",
    "for example , the rule \\{_vanilla cream , emmental_}@xmath1 _ chocolate cream _ usually appears just above its shorter version \\{_vanilla cream_}@xmath1 _ chocolate cream _ , because the first one has a confidence of @xmath18 and the second @xmath19 .",
    "however , experts prefer the second one , because _ emmental _ ( cheese ) is among the heavy hitters in stores .",
    "its addition to the rule is hence considered insignificant .",
    "this `` noise '' generally increases with _",
    "recall_. hence , when no filtering is available , @xmath9 is selected , but analysts prefer the _ recall _ and _ confidence _ trade - off provided by @xmath10 and @xmath16 .",
    "again , @xmath15 suffered from its proximity to @xmath10 with lower confidence , while @xmath17 s confidence was too low .",
    "in all cases , analysts mentioned @xmath17 as uninteresting overall because it selects rules of low _",
    "confidence_. in general , sorting by decreasing _ lift _",
    "( which is close to sorting by decreasing _ confidence _ ) is the preferred choice . combined with the minimum support threshold used in the mining phase ,",
    "this ranking promotes rules that are considered reliable .",
    "however , the preference of the analysts changes when filters are available to narrow down the set of rules to specific product categories . in this case",
    ", they favor the compromise between _ confidence _ and _ support _ offered , for instance , by the _ piatetsky - shapiro _ s measure  @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , targets datasets which are orders of magnitude bigger ( and sparser ) than those tested in existing work on ranking association rules .",
    "this paper is also the first to complement an algorithmic comparative analysis with a user study involving domain experts .",
    "the definition of quality of association rules is a well - studied topic in statistics and data mining , summarized in  @xcite . in this survey ,",
    "geng _ et al .",
    "_ review as many as 38 measures for association and classification rules .",
    "they also discuss 4 sets of properties like symmetry or monotony , and how each of them highlights different meanings of `` rule quality '' , such as novelty and generality .",
    "however , we observe no correlation between these properties and the groups of measures discovered using .    these 38 measures are compared in  @xcite .",
    "authors consider the case of extracting and ranking temporal rules ( _ _ event a__@xmath1_event b _ ) from the execution traces of java programs .",
    "each measure is evaluated in its ability to rank highly rules known from a ground truth ( java library specification ) .",
    "we observe that the measures scoring the highest are all from the groups identified in this work as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which were also favored by our analysts .",
    "there are however some counterexamples , with measures from @xmath9 scoring poorly .",
    "the authors then use a statistical approach to build a partial ordering of measures quality .",
    "this results in the formation of measure equivalence classes .",
    "however , the semantic of these classes is based on the principle of dominance in the evaluation , and not on the comparison of the rankings themselves .",
    "hence , the equivalence classes obtained do not match our groups . the main difference between and  @xcite",
    "is the absence of a ground truth of interesting rules for our dataset .",
    "consequently , our evaluation of measures is first comparative , with 4 correlations measures covering both the top of the ranking and the entire ranked list .",
    "we then build groups of measures to reduce the number of options presented to expert analysts in the user study .",
    "the differences in the results obtained also highlight the importance of performing domain - specific studies , as the properties of data and the expectations of analysts vary significantly .",
    "the closest work to ours is herbs  @xcite .",
    "herbs relies on a different and smaller set of measures to cluster rule rankings .",
    "authors perform an analysis of the properties of measures , in addition to an experimental study .",
    "the datasets used are from the health and astronomy domains .",
    "each of them contains at most transactions and leads to the extraction of 49 to rules .",
    "rankings are then compared between all pairs of measures using kendall s @xmath20 correlation measure averaged over all datasets .",
    "the largest group of measures identified , which includes confidence , is quite similar to @xmath9",
    ". however , there are also significant differences . for instance , we find @xmath14 and @xmath17 to be very different , while  @xcite considers the measures of this group similar . the authors observe a weak resemblance between the theoretical and experimental analysis of the measures .",
    "the main similarity between  @xcite and is the reliance on a pairwise correlation measure followed by a hierarchical clustering to detect groups of measures .",
    "is entirely focused on retail data , which has different properties and contains millions of transactions and rules .",
    "is also more exhaustive in the analysis of measures : we consider more interestingness measures , and 4 different ranking correlation measures instead of 1 .",
    "this allows us to discover more subtle differences in a more specific domain .",
    "finally , we perform a user study to assess the quality of each group according to experts from the retail industry .    our use of the _ p - value _ ( via _ pearson s @xmath8 test _ ) in the evaluation of rule interestingness is borrowed from  @xcite .",
    "a low _ p - value _ shows a correlation between a rule s antecedent and consequent .",
    "the use of _ fisher _ s exact test on association rules is inspired by  @xcite",
    ". both of these works aim at finding highly - correlated itemsets , which requires the analyst to set a threshold on the @xmath21-value .",
    "this is common practice in biology , but less meaningful in the retail industry . in  @xcite ,",
    "also propose an exploration framework where rules are grouped by consequent , then traversed by progressively adding items to the antecedent .",
    "the framework provides hints to help guess how each additional item would make a difference .",
    "such a framework is suitable to some of the scenarios we consider and could be integrated in a future version of  .",
    "in this paper , we present , a framework for mining association rules from large - scale retail data .",
    "we defined 3 mining scenarios allowing analysts to extract associations between user segments and product categories , or products themselves .",
    "given a scenario , builds a dataset of transactions and mines in parallel association rules containing targets selected by the analysts .",
    "our main contribution is the study of 34 interestingness measures for association rules .",
    "we first performed an analytical and an empirical comparison between different rule rankings and grouped measures into 6 families .",
    "resulting groups were then evaluated in a user study involving retail experts .",
    "we concluded that _",
    "lift _ and _ piatetsky - shapiro _ best fit the needs of the analysts , as they ensure a high confidence .",
    "we foresee 3 directions of improvement for . the first one is related to the architecture .",
    "is currently implemented using batch processing and on - disk storage . while mining is already fast , i / o operations introduces some latency between the definition of a mining scenario and the display of results .",
    "we are currently migrating to an in - memory dataset representation , using spark  @xcite , to allow faster target selection and lower response time .",
    "a second improvement is the extraction of negative results ( _ anti_-rules ) .",
    "that is particularly true for rules containing customer segments .",
    "we hence need to determine how negative rules should be ranked in order to properly adjust their proportion in the outcome . finally , while quality measures are crucial to select the most interesting results for the analysts , we would like to introduce diversity in displaying rules and study its impact on analysts satisfaction .",
