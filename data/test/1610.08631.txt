    "the human cells store dna molecule which codes more than 20,000 genes in their nucleus .",

    "these interactions sometimes promote the functions of the proteins and sometimes they inhibit each other .",
    "the protein - protein interaction networks thus regulate the cell behavior under ever changing circumstances . in the nucleus , the genes which code these interacting proteins have the spatial and the temporal correlations in their expression patterns . from the observation of the gene co - expression patterns with the high - throughput experiments such as microarray or next - generation sequencing technology , the gene interaction networks which are related especially to human disease including cancer",
    "have been studied extensively .",
    "( @xcite )    recent studies have revealed that there are also large regions which do not code any protein in the dna molecule , and they are also highly transcribed .",
    "these transcripts are called non - coding rnas . ( @xcite ) the importance of such non - coding rnas as the regulators of gene expressions has become widely known to date from various experiments .",
    "( @xcite ) it is known that the non - coding rnas interact or bind with other transcripts selectively and thus regulate gene expressions .",
    "( @xcite ) the micro rnas , which is about 20nt subset of the non - coding rnas , have also observed to negatively regulate gene expressions through interactions with other rnas or even with the dna .",
    "( @xcite ) these interaction networks of transcripts have important role in cellular cycles including cell development , proliferation , apoptosis and disease .",
    "( @xcite ) however , the behavior of such complex networks are totally unknown yet .",
    "the relation between the various diseases such as cancer and the modification of such molecular networks has also been extensively studied .",
    "( @xcite ) for example , several micro rnas behave as inhibitors for specific interactions in the transcripts network , and they act as potential oncogenes or tumor genes as the result of permitting uncontrolled proliferation of damaged cells .",
    "( @xcite )    the investigation of topological modifications of such transcripts networks in the damaged cells is also important for the discovery of new biomarkers or the detailed classification of the symptoms .",
    "( @xcite ) the high - throughput experimental studies on cancer cells provide huge molecular interaction networks which include 20,000 to two million elements from a single assay .",
    "such experiments have become very popular these days owing to wide distributions of commercial platforms .",
    "the raw data from such experiments are later accessible on the internet , for example the ncbi geo ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) provides the public database of gene expression data which can be downloaded freely .",
    "( @xcite ) by using these data , it is also possible to do the meta - analytic study of gene expressions .",
    "for example , from the multiple data obtained from several different microarray experiments on specific cancer cells , one may investigate some typical gene interaction networks of the cancer under study .",
    "the computational inference of the gene interactions with the expression data begins with the statistical procedures such as clustering or the principal component analysis .",
    "then the individual interactions between genes are computationally calculated using various network algorithms .",
    "the inferred interactions are usually provided with the confidence factor or the likelihood which manifests the probability of the interaction .",
    "there are several gene interaction network databases which is based on , for example , the mutual information ( aracne ) ( @xcite ) , the bayesian inference ( sign - bn ) ( @xcite ) and much more .",
    "( @xcite )    in graph theory , the elements in the network are called nodes and the interaction between two nodes is expressed by an edge in between .",
    "these edges may have directions . in the case of protein - protein interaction network",
    ", the interaction edges are usually non - directed . in the gene interaction networks ,",
    "the directed edges express the regulatory relations between genes .",
    "there are many other networks , such as web - site relationships network , social networks , as well as the biological transcripts networks , which are all known to have universal behaviors .",
    "one of such universal behaviors , the scale free behavior is extensively studied so far .",
    "( @xcite ) in the scale free network , there are special nodes called hubs which have remarkably large number of edges ( degree ) , and other nodes have a few or only one edge .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the degree @xmath0 obeys asymptotical powerlaw behavior .",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2",
    ". such universal behavior of the interaction networks including the transcripts networks in living cells have been one of the key in the study of the system biology .",
    "the computational inference of the gene interactions using the gene expression data are usually highly time consuming since it includes huge iterative learning procedures in selected groups of nodes .",
    "thus the obtained network size is usually limited . in order to manage the large network size up to the order of @xmath3 genes ,",
    "the calculation must be parallelized and performed on the supercomputers equipped with many cpus .",
    "once the gene interaction is computationally obtained , it should contain much noise due to the experiment , the statistical manupulation of data , and the inferrence learning .",
    "so the calculated edges should be experimentally confirmed in - vivo microscopically with the techniques such as knocking down gene experiments in living organisms or rna interference afterwards . on the other hand , in the investigation of the relation between the disease and the topological modification of gene interaction networks , a new method which enables us to obtain",
    "the macroscopic view of a huge complex network is also necessary .",
    "the random matrix theory ( rmt)(@xcite ) has been applied to a variety of fields not only in physics but also in the biological field .",

    "( @xcite ) previously , we also have studied the protein - protein interaction in many organisms including human , yeast , and arabidopsis with rmt method and obtained universal behaviors in the distribution of the nearest neighbor level spacing of interaction ( or adjacency ) matrices .",
    "this distribution is called the wigner distribution . moreover , in the protein - protein interaction related to oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cells , we have found that the wigner distribution changes to the poisson distribution . from these studies we consider that rmt gives a clue to the understanding of the huge complex networks in cells .    in this work ,",
    "we apply the rmt analysis for the cancer network galaxy ( tcng ) gene interaction networks obtained from 256 microarray expression data on cancer cells .",
