    "binary stars matter in astronomy in many different ways : as calibrators of various stellar properties , as tracers of star formation , and as hosts to diverse astrophysical phenomena such as mass transfer , circumstellar and circumbinary discs , or dynamical resonances , to name a few .",
    "knowledge of orbital elements is needed in these applications .",
    "however , only a small fraction of known visual binaries have known orbits , mostly because of orbital periods being much longer than the time covered by observations .",
    "even known orbits are not always reliable for the same reason : lack of sufficient data .",
    "we report here a large set of binary - star measurements made at the 4.1-m southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) with the speckle camera .",
    "this paper continues the previous series published by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tmh10 ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tmh14 ) .",
    "our primary goal is improvement of known orbital elements and determination of new orbits .",
    "the emphasis is placed on close and nearby pairs resolvable at soar , where orbital periods are measured in years rather than decades or centuries .",
    "the orbits of these fast binaries can be computed or improved only after a few years of speckle - interferometry monitoring .",
    "many orbits were already computed for the first time or improved using data obtained during previous speckle runs .",
    "an `` orbit optimizer '' was used now to select binaries where observations in the coming three years could potentially yield noticeable orbit improvement .",
    "the second , overlapping program is the characterization of multiplicity of solar - type stars within 67pc ( the fg-67 sample , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by resolving known binaries with astrometric acceleration @xcite or variable radial velocity ( rv ) ,",
    "we obtain estimates of their periods and mass ratios and lay a foundation for future orbit determination .",
    "the spectroscopic discoveries are mostly furnished by the geneva - copenhagen survey of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gcs ) . on the other hand , by observing relatively wide binaries with separations up to 3  we constrain the existence of subsystems around their components .",
    "several such subsystems are discovered here .",
    "in addition , we have now specially targeted distant physical secondary components to the main fg-67 stars , looking for subsystems .",
    "this work @xcite complements the large survey of the northern sky done with robo - ao @xcite and shows that subsystems in the secondary components are as frequent as in the main components .",
    "in this paper we also observed _ hipparcos _ binaries within 200pc with southern declinations , so far largely neglected .",
    "these observations allow us to evaluate orbital motion and to find a subset of `` fast movers '' for further monitoring .",
    "some nearby tight binaries from _ hipparcos _ were monitored from the outset of the soar speckle program .",
    "this strategy of focusing on fast binaries has resulted in several new orbits , with more still to come .",
    "our approach for this program was therefore similar and complementary to that of the speckle program active at the wiyn 3.5-m telescope at kitt peak in recent years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to date , that program has resolved over 150 close companions from the _ hipparcos _ list .",
    "we re - observed some close ( hopefully , fast ) pairs resolved at the blanco telescope in 2008 .",
    "some of them moved substantially in 6 years , and may yield first orbits .",
    "as a `` filler '' , several neglected pairs were also measured or found unresolved .    this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes briefly the instrument and data processing and gives an estimate of data consistency for the whole series of measurements at soar .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] in the form of data tables with comments on the newly resolved pairs and multiple systems . in section",
    "[ sec : orb ] , the new and revised orbits are given , and section  [ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "the observations reported here were obtained with the _ high - resolution camera _ ( hrcam )  a fast imager designed to work at the 4.1-m soar telescope @xcite . for practical reasons ,",
    "the camera was mounted on the soar adaptive module ( sam , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the laser guide star of sam was not used ; the deformable mirror of sam was passively flattened and the images are seeing - limited .",
    "the sam module corrects for atmospheric dispersion and helps to calibrate the pixel scale and orientation of hrcam , as explained in tmh14 .",
    "the transmission curves of hrcam filters are given in the instrument manual .",
    "we used mostly the strmgren @xmath0 filter ( 543/22 nm ) and the near - infrared @xmath1 filter ( 788/132 nm ) .",
    "the response curve of the latter was re - defined as a product of the filter transmission and detector response furnished by the respective manufacturers .",
    "the electron multiplication ccd ( em ccd ) luca - s used in hrcam failed in 2014 july .",
    "it was sent to its manufacturer ( andor ) for repair and received back in 2014 december .",
    "for the two runs in the fall of 2014 , we used the em ccd luca - r , kindly loaned by g.  cecil .",
    "it has a larger format of 1004@xmath21002 pixels , with smaller pixels of 8@xmath3 m compared to luca - s ( 658@xmath2496 , 10@xmath3 m pixels ) . the second lens in hrcam",
    "was replaced by the achromatic doublet of 75-mm focal length to get the pixel scale of 14.33mas .",
    "the detector software driver was also upgraded on this occasion .",
    "although the two luca cameras look exactly the same and come from the same manufacturer , their ccds are radically different .",
    "luca - s uses a line - transfer ccd , while luca - r has a frame - transfer ccd .",
    "we found that luca - r had poor charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) in the vertical direction .",
    "weak signals such as cosmic - ray hits and dark current from hot pixels are smeared vertically over @xmath4 5 pixels , while strong signals are transferred with less spread .",
    "this results in the signal - dependent loss of resolution in the vertical direction ( along ccd columns ) , which was accounted for in the data processing by an additional adjustable parameter .",
    "this problem was revealed unexpectedly during the 2014 october run . in the next run",
    ", we placed stars closer to the line register , improving slightly the vertical cte by reducing the number of charge transfers .",
    "we studied the distribution of the bias signal of both cameras .",
    "it is very well modeled by the sum of a gaussian component ( readout noise ) and a negative exponent that corresponds to the single - electron events amplified stochastically by the gain register .",
    "most events are generated by the ccd clocking ( clock - induced charge , cic ) typical for em ccds .",
    "the width ( decrement ) of the exponential term depends on the em gain .",
    "the rate of cic events is found as the ratio of the areas below these two terms . for luca - r ,",
    "the readout noise is 4.5 analog - to - digital units ( adu ) and the cic rate is 0.03 .",
    "the cic events are not smeared vertically because no charge transfer is involved . for luca - s ,",
    "the readout noise is 9 adu , the exponential decrement is 30 adu ( for the gain setting of 200 used here ) , and the rate of cic events is 0.13 per pixel .",
    "about half of the cic events are removed by the threshold of 17  adu applied in the power - spectrum calculation .",
    "the soar telescope suffers from 50-hz vibration ( see tmh14 ) .",
    "the vibrations are non - stationary , causing variable loss of resolution if the 20-ms exposure time is used .",
    "most data were taken with an exposure of 5ms , sampling 1/4 of the vibration period . the resolution is then recovered and the effect of vibrations becomes less dramatic .",
    "it disappears completely at an exposure time of 2ms , used on the brightest targets . with such short exposures ,",
    "the power spectra extend to the cutoff frequency and are very symmetric .",
    "the luca - r detector suffering from the cte problem was used mostly with a 10-ms exposure as a compromise between vibrations and poor cte at low signal levels .",
    "the observations consist of taking a cube of 400 images of 200@xmath2200 pixels each . for binaries wider than 15 ,",
    "the 400@xmath2400 format was used . each object and filter combination",
    "is normally recorded twice , these data are processed independently , and the result is averaged .",
    "we used 2@xmath22 detector binning on the faintest targets observed in the @xmath1 filter , with a minor under - sampling and loss of resolution .",
    "measurements of binaries made with and without binning agree well mutually .",
    "faint red dwarfs with @xmath5 still produced useful data .      the observing time for this program",
    "was allocated through noao ( proposals 2013b-0172 , 2014a-0038 , 2014b-0019 , 8 nights total ) and by the chilean national tac ( proposal cn2014b-27 , 4 nights ) .",

    ".    runs 4 and 5 used the substitute detector luca - r and were affected by the cte problem .",
    "for this reason the observations were performed mostly in the @xmath1 filter with 10-ms exposure .",
    "all three nights of run 4 were clear , and mostly with good seeing ( the median full width at half maximum , fwhm , of re - centered average images was 060 , the best fwhm was around 045 ) .",
    "the detector was removed between runs 4 and 5 in an attempt to improve the cte by tuning the electronic parameters ; however , this turned out to be impossible . during run 5 , the seeing varied from average to poor . in the worst case ,",
    "the star did not fit in the 3  field , illuminating all pixels . in such cases ,",
    "the image is truncated , the power spectrum contains bright vertical and horizontal lines , and the detection limits are poor . under poor seeing , data obtained with the 400-pixel field and 2@xmath22 binning are of better quality , without image truncation .",
    "the two nights of run 6 were clear , with seeing average to poor .",
    "the hrcam was returned to its original configuration with the luca - s detector .",
    "measurements with the sam internal light source confirmed that the pixel scale did not change compared to runs 13 .",
    "the data processing is described in tmh10 . as a first step ,",
    "power spectra and average re - centered images are calculated from the data cubes .",
    "the auto - correlation functions ( acfs ) are computed from the power spectra .",
    "they are used to detect companions and to evaluate the detection limits .",
    "the parameters of binary and triple stars are determined by fitting the power spectrum to its model , which is a product of the binary ( or triple ) star spectrum and the reference spectrum .",
    "we used as a reference the azimuthally - averaged spectrum of the target itself in the case of binaries wider than 01 . for closer pairs ,",
    "the `` synthetic '' reference was used ( see tmh10 ) .",
    "the signal - dependent vertical smearing of the image caused by the cte problem required a modification of the reference spectrum .",
    "we model the smearing by an additional gaussian term in the reference spectrum @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are spatial frequency coordinates along ccd lines and columns respectively , @xmath16 is the diffraction - limited transfer function , @xmath17 is the cutoff frequency , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe the speckle signal attenuation ( both are negative , @xmath19 is related to seeing ) , and the new parameter @xmath21 is the fwhm of the cte smear in the column direction in pixels .",
    "this `` elliptical '' synthetic reference was used for all binaries , both wide and close , observed in runs 4 and 5 .",
    "the parameters of the reference @xmath22 were fitted to the power spectrum jointly with the binary parameters @xmath23 .    in the case of close binaries ,",
    "the parameters of the elliptical reference and of the binary itself are mutually correlated , so the resulting measures could be biased .",
    "the close binary star b  430 ( _ 19155@xmath92515 _ ) was observed with position angles of the instrument differing by @xmath24 .",
    "the `` fringes '' in the power spectrum had different orientation relative to the ccd",
    ". however , the binary parameters @xmath25 fitted to these power spectra are mutually consistent , ( 2837 , 00673 , 0.785 ) and ( 2850 , 00690 , 0.722 ) .",
    "therefore , the cte effect is , to first order , accounted for by the modified reference model .",
    "still , measurements of close binaries from runs 4 and 5 ( 2014.77 and 2014.86 ) should be taken with some caution .",
    "wide binaries resolvable in the re - centered long - exposure images are processed by another code that fits only the magnitude difference @xmath26 , using the binary position from speckle processing .",
    "this procedure corrects the bias on @xmath27 caused by speckle anisoplanatism and establishes the correct quadrant ( flag * in the data table ) .    for run 5 , we also calculated shift - and - add ( saa or `` lucky '' ) images , centered on the brightest pixel in each frame and weighted proportionally to the intensity of that pixel .",
    "all frames without rejection were co - added .",
    "binary companions , except the closest and the faintest ones , are detectable in these saa images , helping to identify the correct quadrant .",
    "such cases are marked by the flag q in the data table .",
    "quadrants of the remaining binary stars are guessed based on prior data or orbits , not measured directly .",
    "calibration of scale and angular offset in speckle interferometry is challenging because the accuracy of modern measurements with 4-m telescopes exceeds the accuracy of even the best orbits .",
    "comparison with ephemerides is useful only as a sanity check . recognizing this problem",
    ", we observed several wide binaries during each run .",
    "their motions are slow and can be modeled by linear functions of time .",
    "these models can then be used to check the calibration of the archival data .",
    "this approach tests only the mutual consistency of speckle runs , rather than absolute calibration of the whole data set .",
    "we selected 41 binaries wider than 05 that do not contain resolved subsystems and were observed during at least 4 runs each .",
    "the angle and separation of each binary is approximated by linear functions of time .",
    "if the fitted slope is less than twice its rms error , a zero slope is assumed .",
    "deviations from these models are interpreted as calibration corrections . for each run , they are median - averaged .",
    "we then iterate by fitting new linear models corrected for the run s systematics , determining new calibration parameters of the runs , etc .",

    "vertical bars show the rms scatter between calibrators ( not errors of the mean , which are smaller by @xmath29 ) .",
    "a typical rms scatter is 01 in angle and 0.3% in scale .",
    "this analysis reveals good mutual consistency of @xmath45000 speckle measurements produced by hrcam to date .",
    "the largest systematics are found in runs 10 and 11 ( 2011.9 and 2012.1 ) .",
    "the published data can be corrected by subtracting the angular offsets found here and dividing the separations by the new scale factors .",
    "we plan to observe more calibrators and publish improved systematic corrections in the future .",
    "the data of this paper rely only on the original instrument calibrations and _ are not corrected _ for the offsets found so far .",
    "this study gives an estimate of the accuracy of speckle measurements .",
    "after correction for run systematics , the median rms deviations from the models for the 41 calibrator binaries are 01 in angle and 1.9mas in separation .",
    "the actual errors should be a factor of @xmath41.5 larger ( @xmath43mas ) , considering that the number of independent measurements is about twice the number of fitted parameters .",

    "even with the larger dynamical parallax ( instead of the hip2 parallax ) , all three resolved components of hip  84430 are located above the main sequence in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this multiple system is peculiar and merits further study .",
    "we present here a large set of new speckle interferometry measurements of close binary stars , mostly with southern declinations .",
    "the total number of measurements made with hrcam since 2008 now exceeds 5000 .",
    "this unique data set is used for calculation of 46 new orbits and for improvement of 148 known orbits . for comparison",
    ", the data in tmh14 resulted in 13 new orbits and in the improvement ( sometimes drastic ) of 45 previously known orbits .",
    "we demonstrate the good internal consistency of speckle astrometry with hrcam by repeated measurements of relatively wide binaries .",
    "typical errors are on the order of 3mas even for these wide pairs .",
    "the high angular resolution and dynamic range of hrcam give access to close binaries never resolved before .",
    "some of those objects had prior indication of binarity from variable rv or astrometric acceleration .",
    "in such cases , direct resolution allows us to estimate statistically orbital periods ( which are typically short ) and to evaluate masses .",
    "this clarifies the statistics of binary and multiple stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we also resolved a number of components in previously known nearby wide binaries , converting them into triple or higher - order hierarchies .",
    "a total of 56 newly - resolved pairs are reported here , ten of those being inner or outer subsystems in visual binaries ( figure  [ fig : acf ] ) .",
    "most of those subsystems are totally unexpected .",
    "some of the newly resolved binaries or subsystems are interesting for various reasons , such as being young ( e.g. x - ray sources ) , having comparable separations and approaching the dynamical stability limit , such as hip  9497 with periods of 138 and 13.9 years ( tmh14 ) , or being targets of exo - planet programs .",
    "we thank the operators of soar d.  maturana , p.  ugarte , s.  pizarro , and j.  espinoza for efficient support of our program .",
    "g.  cecil has kindly loaned us his luca - r detector which was used for five nights instead of our own broken camera .",
