    "wasp-12b is among the largest transiting planets discovered so far .",
    "first identified in an optical photometric transit survey ( * ? ? ? * hereafter , h09 ) , its mass is @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and radius of jupiter , respectively .",
    "after its discovery , additional observations have been acquired ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , transit observations in the near - uv revealed a longer transit duration than in the optical @xcite . while the time of the egress occurs almost simultaneously for both set of observations , the ingress of the transit is first seen in the near - uv wavelength range .",
    "this asymmetric behavior has been explained by the presence of asymmetries in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "close - in giant gas planets are rather inflated and most have developed an exosphere ( hd  209458b : @xcite ; hd  189733b : @xcite ; corot - exo-1b : @xcite ; wasp-12b : @xcite ) that can fill or even overflow the planet s roche lobe @xcite . this may result in mass transfer through a lagrangian point to the star that could cause an asymmetry in the appearance of the transiting planet - star system as seen from the earth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , lhv10 ) .",
    "asymmetries could also be produced by cometary tails .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated for hd  209458b that a radiation - driven cometary tail would produce a late egress of the planetary transit light curve , instead of an early ingress . investigated the formation of a bow shock around the planet due to the interaction of the planet s magnetosphere with a stellar wind as the cause of the early ingress . assuming a typical solar wind mass - loss rate and adopting solar wind properties , derived the wind velocity at the distance of wasp-12b using a thermally driven wind model @xcite .",
    "they found that the wind is still subsonic at wasp-12b orbital distance , concluding that no bow shock is expected to form in the planet - wind interaction zone . here ,",
    "we demonstrate that a bow shock can actually be formed around the planet if the relative azimuthal velocity between the planetary orbital motion and the ambient medium is taken into account .",
    "wasp-12b orbits its host star ( a late - f main - sequence star , with mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 ) at an orbital radius of @xmath9 , with an orbital period of @xmath10  d . due to its close proximity to the star ,",
    "the flux of coronal particles impacting on the planet comes mainly from the azimuthal direction , as the planet moves at a keplerian orbital velocity of @xmath11  km  s@xmath12 around the star .",
    "therefore , stellar coronal material is compressed ahead of the planetary orbital motion , possibly forming a bow shock ahead of the planet .",
    "if such compressed material is optically thin , the planetary transit light curve is symmetrical with respect to the ingress and the egress of the planet .",
    "indeed , this is the case when the transit is observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "however , if the shocked material ahead of the planet can absorb enough stellar radiation , the observer will note an early ingress of the planet in the stellar disk , but no difference will be seen at the time of egress , as the shocked material is present only ahead of the planetary motion .    here , we investigate under which conditions the interaction of a planet with the stellar coronal plasma could lead to the formation of a bow shock ahead of the planetary orbital motion , and therefore , explain the early ingress observable in the near - uv .",
    "our shock model is described in section  [ sec.shockbasics ] .",
    "although we know the orbital radius of the planet , we do not know if at this radius the stellar magnetic field is still capable of confining the hot gas of the stellar corona , or if this gas is escaping in a wind .",
    "therefore , we investigate the validity of our model with respect to different stellar coronal conditions in sections  [ sec.corona ] and [ sec.wind ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec.conclusions ] .",
    "a bow shock around a planet is formed when the relative motion between the planet and the stellar corona / wind is supersonic .",
    "the shock configuration depends on the direction of the flux of particles that arrives at the planet .",
    "we illustrate two different limits of the shock configuration and an intermediate case in figure  [ fig.shockconditions ] , where @xmath13 is the deflection angle between the azimuthal direction of the planetary motion and @xmath14 , a vector that defines the outward direction of the shock . as seen from the planet",
    ", @xmath15 is the velocity of the impacting material .        the first shock limit , a `` dayside - shock '' , occurs when the dominant flux of particles impacting on the planet arises from the ( radial ) wind of its host star . for instance , the impact of the supersonic solar wind forms a bow shock at the dayside of earth s magnetosphere ( i.e. , at the side that faces the sun ) .",
    "this condition is illustrated in figure  [ fig.shockconditions](a ) and is met when @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the local radial stellar wind velocity and sound speed , respectively .    a second shock limit , an `` ahead - shock '' , occurs when the dominant flux of particles impacting on the planet arises from the relative azimuthal velocity between the planetary orbital motion and the ambient plasma .",
    "this condition is especially important when the planet orbits at a close distance to the star , and therefore , possesses a high @xmath19 . in this case , the velocity of the particles that the planet ` sees ' is supersonic if @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the azimuthal velocity of the stellar corona .",
    "this condition is illustrated in figure  [ fig.shockconditions](b ) .    for intermediate cases , both the wind and",
    "the azimuthal relative velocities will contribute to the formation of a shock around the planet ( figure  [ fig.shockconditions](c ) ) and the deflection angle @xmath13 is given by @xmath22 in general , for a planet orbiting its host star at a close distance , the stellar wind is still accelerating and subsonic ( @xmath23 ) . in this case",
    ", conditions for an ahead - shock will more probably be met .    here",
    ", we adopt the estimates of to derive the minimum density of the stellar plasma at the orbital radius of wasp-12b . from the observations presented in @xcite , estimated the column density of the absorbing gas around the planet to be @xmath24 . for that",
    ", they assumed @xmath25 in the absorption lines of mg .",
    "because the time resolution of the transit measurement is sparse , it is difficult to place a firm constrain on the thickness of the absorbing material , which could either extend all the way to the planetary surface or be limited to a geometrically thin shocked region . through time differences of the optical / near - uv ingresses , estimated that the stand - off distance between the shock and the center of the planet is about @xmath26 , leading to a mg density @xmath27 .",
    "here , we convert this minimum density to hydrogen number density by using the observed metallicity of wasp-12 , @xmath28=0.3 $ ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the solar element abundances for mg and h , respectively @xcite . therefore , the minimum density of the shocked stellar coronal plasma is @xmath32 the density behind such a shock would , in the adiabatic limit , be at most four times the density ahead of the shock . from equation  ( [ eq.shock-density ] )",
    ", this would then require a pre - shock coronal density of @xmath33 in the external ambient medium at the orbital radius of the planet .",
    "the temperature of the absorbing material must be such as to allow for the presence of mg ii lines .",
    "for an adiabatic shock , the temperature immediately behind the shock depends on the squared mach number of the flow impacting on the planet . to determine the temperature and ionization structures of the atmosphere of the planet , and",
    "therefore quantitatively evaluate the optical depth of mg ii lines , detailed radiative transfer models are needed .",
    "in this section , we assume that the orbit of the planet lies within the stellar magnetosphere . in this case , the planet moves through a medium that is confined by a rigid stellar magnetic field and so rotates at the stellar rotation rate .",
    "the relative azimuthal velocity between the planet and this medium is therefore @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the velocity of the medium corotating with the star , and @xmath36 is the stellar period of rotation .",
