    "such variations have been invoked to explain the dispersion in mass accretion rates observed in cvs ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "possibilities include star spots ( livio & pringle 1994 ) or instabilities in the secular mass transfer induced by the anisotropic irradiation of the secondary ( ritter , zhang & kolb 2000 ) .",
    "+ with @xmath115 in quiescence , the dereddened apparent magnitude of the k7v companion is @xmath116 ( assuming a 30% @xmath117% veiling ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of a k7v star is @xmath118 , hence @xmath119 , in good agreement with previous estimates ( tomsick et al .",
    "1999 , homan et al . 1999 ) . with a distance of @xmath120  kpc and @xmath121 , xte j2123 - 058",
    "lies @xmath122 kpc above the galactic plane and it has been proposed that it may be a halo object escaped from a globular cluster ( homan et al .",
    "we can test this hypothesis using the new information provided by our systemic radial velocity @xmath123 km s@xmath2 . in the absence of peculiar motions ,",
    "the observed line - of - sight velocity @xmath124 will be driven by the differential galactic rotation and the sun s motion relative to the local standard of rest i.e.    @xmath125    where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 kpc , @xmath129 km s@xmath2 and @xmath130 is the galactic rotation velocity at the position of j2123 - 058 ( frenk & white 1980 ; morrison et al .",
    "1990 ) . using @xmath131 km s@xmath2 , @xmath121 , @xmath132 and @xmath133  kpc",
    "we find @xmath134 km s@xmath2 which is consistent with the low rotation velocities of globular clusters with galactocentric distances in the range 2 - 33 kpc ( frenk & white 1980 ) and halo stars ( freeman 1988 ) .",
    "we note , however , that only one velocity component is known and the true rotational velocity might be substantially different . in an attempt to find evidence of proper motion in j2123 - 058",
    "we have also performed astrometry on our best quality images taken during outburst ( 5 july 98 ) and quiescence ( 19 aug 99 ) but found no significant motion with upper limits @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , the formation scenario of j2123 - 058 can not be tested on pure kinematical grounds .",
    "+ the transition from galactic disc to halo is known to occur sharply at [ fe / h ] = -1.0 ( e.g. ratnatunga & freeman 1989 ) and hence the companion star of j2123 - 058 would be metal poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath137 -1.0 ) if formed in the halo .",
    "unfortunately , a difference of one dex in metallicity would produce only tiny changes in line strength at the low @xmath138 of the secondary .",
    "these changes are completely undetectable in our moderate s / n average spectrum .",
    "the evidence that j2123 - 058 is not a halo object was raised by hynes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on the relative strength of the bowen blend and heii @xmath04686 emission lines during outburst .",
    "this supports the idea that j2123 - 058 was indeed formed in the galactic plane and received a large supernova kick ( 150 - 400 km  s@xmath2 , homan et al .",
    "1999 ) to reach its present location .",
    "we note that kalogera , kolb & king ( 1998 ) conclude that \" large kick velocities will favour the formation of short - period systems with unevolved donors  . + our h@xmath21 doppler imaging of the accretion disk poses several interpretative difficulties .",
    "the map shows significant emission at the @xmath80 point but not from the hot spot .",
    "enhanced emission would be expected from this hemisphere of the companion during outburst when it faces irradiation from the accreting neutron star .",
    "typical x - ray luminosities of neutron star sxts in quiescence are @xmath139 erg s@xmath2 and this luminosity would be sufficient to power the observed h@xmath21 emission ( more details will be presented in shahbaz et al .",
    "alternatively , the emission could be due to chromospheric activity on the secondary ( bildsten & rutledge 2000 ) , e.g. star spots close to the @xmath80 point ( which would help reduce the mass transfer rate ) could explain enhanced h@xmath21 emission .",
    "+ part of the h@xmath21 emission observed in fig.3 is located at velocities which are too low to be associated with a keplerian disk and in anti - phase with the secondary , a similar situation to that observed during outburst by hynes et al .",
    "their higher quality doppler map was very reminiscent of those seen in a group of nova - like cvs , the sw sex stars .",
    "hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that the mechanism was probably the same and likely to be a propeller . in this scenario , a magnetic field anchored in the disk",
    "interacts with the accretion stream from the secondary , ejecting blobs of matter out of the system .",
    "the trajectories depend on the mass but all intersect at some location .",
    "the collision of the blobs of different sizes in this area produces the asymmetric enhanced emission which is observed ( horne 1999 ) .",
    "+ the sw sex stars and sxts in outbursts have high accretion rates .",
    "in contrast , our doppler map was obtained in quiescence when the accretion rate is very low .",
    "if the outbursts are due to the thermal - viscous instability , the thin disk becomes neutral which casts doubts on its ability to anchor a magnetic field for this propeller mechanism to work .",
    "on the other hand , the inner regions of the thin disk are most probably replaced by a hot thick and optically thin accretion flow during quiescence .",
    "this is required to explain e.g. the x - ray luminosities of quiescent bh sxts ( lasota , narayan & yi 1996 and the review by narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) or the recurrence times of sxts ( dubus , hameury & lasota 2001 ) .",
    "these ionised flows have very short accretion timescales which makes it unlikely that they could sustain large - scale steady magnetic fields reaching to the accretion stream . + the neutron star magnetosphere itself can become an efficient propeller in quiescence ( menou et al .",
    "strong winds in the thick accretion flow could also prevent much of the matter from reaching the ns ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "yet , it is hard to see in both cases how this would lead to the observed asymmetric h@xmath21 emission since the matter comes from an _ axisymmetric _ flow .",
