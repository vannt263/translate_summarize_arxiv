    "determining the strength of the magnetization of the `` quiet '' sun is tied to the question of how much flux resides at small scales .",
    "this is important , for example , in determining the energy budget available for chromospheric heating .",
    "observationally , two methods are employed to constrain the solar magnetic field : the hanle and zeeman effects . the hanle effect measures ( in principle )",
    "the mean magnetic field strength , @xmath6 , as there are no cancellation effects , but quantitative interpretation requires assumptions about the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the turbulent magnetic field . the hanle de - polarization is measured in strong lines formed in the photosphere and estimates are made of @xmath7 g , the field residing primarily in the intergranular lanes @xcite .",
    "the zeeman effect measures the longitudinal component ( via stokes  @xmath1 ) and transverse components ( via stokes  @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) of the magnetic field but suffers from cancellation effects .",
    "hence , it is `` blind '' to any `` hidden '' mixed - polarity flux at scales smaller than the resolution limit of an instrument .",
    "however , the benefit of zeeman measurements is that their interpretation requires no assumption about the turbulent pdf and measurements can actually be used to determine the pdf on scales larger than the resolution limit .",
    "some attempts to incorporate the effects of cancellation into zeeman - based stokes inversions utilize the micro - structured field hypothesis @xcite . however , typical estimates based on the longitudinal zeeman effect give @xmath10 g for the mean unsigned vertical flux density ( see table 3 in @xcite for a review of the spread of recent zeeman - based estimates ) .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than the hanle - based estimates .",
    "the discrepancy between the results from hanle ( @xmath11 g ) and zeeman ( @xmath12 g ) measurements is not unexpected since the zeeman observations see only the resolved flux while the hanle interpretation depends on assumptions about an unknown pdf .    in this work",
    ", we ask the question `` how can the turbulent fractal geometry of the magnetic field in the solar photosphere be accounted for in interpretations of zeeman - based observations ? ''",
    "we attempt to derive the spectral / fractal properties from high resolution ( @xmath13 ) zeeman observations with the _ hinode _ spectro - polarimeter ( sp ) @xcite and high resolution ( down to @xmath14km@xmath15 ) , turbulent dynamo simulations ( up to magnetic reynolds numbers , @xmath16 ) with the ` muram ` code @xcite .",
    "first , we clarify the consistency of pdfs derived from observations and simulations , respectively .",
    "zeeman observations typically show pdfs of quantities derived from stokes  @xmath1 which can be described as a peaked function @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the peaked pdfs from stokes  @xmath1 measurements and the monotonic pdfs typically reported from numerical simulations are , in fact , compatible .",
    "failure to take into account this observational bias can lead to a gross underestimation of the prevalence of weak fields and , consequently , to incorrect estimates of the mean magnetic field strength and magnetic energy density in the solar photosphere .",
    "second , we extrapolate the results obtained with observations and simulations ( based on their respective fractal properties ) to scales below the resolution limits to estimate the amount of `` hidden '' flux . to do this ,",
    "we exploit the fact that the fractal geometry is intimately connected to power - law scaling relations such as @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the number of boxes of edge length @xmath19 covering a fractal set ( such as all pixels with apparent magnetic flux above some threshold ) and @xmath20 is the fractal dimension .",
    "it has long been known that the distribution of plage magnetic field is such a statistically self - similar fractal @xcite .",
    "as the threshold can influence the fractal dimension inferred , however , the geometrical structure is more complicated than a simple fractal . in this case , the fractal concept must be generalized by adding a measure defined by the absolute value of the net magnetic flux through each box of edge length @xmath19 .",
    "this measure also displays self - similarity ( a power - law scaling ) for the solar quiet sun network magnetic flux ( down to @xmath21 resolution in @xcite and @xcite ; see also @xcite ) and also for numerical simulations of magnetoconvection @xcite .",
    "hence , the geometry of the magnetic field is said to be multifractal .",
    "cancellation effects do not play an important role in observations of the multifractal unipolar solar regions discussed above .",
    "in contrast , if the magnetic field of the quiet sun internetwork is multifractal ( as we will show ) , cancellation can play a significant role for scales below @xmath22 for these mixed - polarity fields it is necessary to further generalize the fractal concept to a signed measure . here , the power - law scaling exponent is the cancellation exponent @xcite .",
    "if this self - similar power - law scaling extends below the observational resolution , small scale cancellation will occur and correct values of the mean field strength and energy can not be established . as was pointed out by @xcite , such a signed measure could also be employed to extrapolate moments of the magnetic field below resolvable limits . until now , no attempt has been made to employ self - similar scaling to estimate the total cancellation , and , hence , the true mean quiet - sun magnetic field strength .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we use ` muram ` simulations @xcite for a rectangular domain of horizontal extent @xmath23mm@xmath24 and a depth of @xmath25 mm .",
    "runs of small - scale , local dynamo action with increasing resolution and reynolds numbers have been carried out ( see table [ table : runs ] ) .",
    "the turbulence is sufficient for small - scale dynamo action @xcite .",
    "all magnetic field in the simulations results from dynamo amplification of a small seed field as there is no net flux through the box , no flux advected into the box , and no initial large - scale field .",
    "a well - known rule - of - thumb for forced turbulence simulations is that one decade of scales smaller than the forcing is required before the inertial range begins and another decade is required ( at the opposite end of the spectrum ) for the dissipative scales . for photospheric magneto - convection simulations , where the forcing granulation scale is 1 mm",
    ", this means that a grid resolution of 10 km or smaller is required before a simulation becomes turbulent . as we compute simulations down to a grid resolution of 4 km , we are now able to measure the effects of turbulence on observational quantities .    to this end , we require synthetic profiles ( for the fei lines at 6301.5    and 6302.5",
    " ) as calculated from a snapshot of a run with non - grey radiative transfer .",
    "owing to the computational expense of such a run , it was started from a snapshot from the statistically stationary state of run c ( see table [ table : runs ] ) and then run for approximately one convective turnover time , 10 minutes .",
    "stokes @xmath1 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 profiles were then computed in one dimension ( 1d ) assuming local - thermodynamic - equilibrium ( lte ) and using the ` stopro ` code in the ` spinor ` package @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate in this work , however , on stokes  @xmath1 observations ( and synthetic observations ) at disk center .",
    "this allows us to avoid line - of - sight effects , to identify the longitudinal component of the magnetic field as its vertical component , and to avoid the difficult estimation of the cancellation properties of stokes  @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "observational data is obtained from the spectro - polarimeter ( sp , @xcite ) of the solar optical telescope ( sot , @xcite ) on the _ hinode _ satellite @xcite .",

    "the data set covers a quiet sun region at the disk center , over the large field of view of @xmath30 .",
    "corrections for various instrumental effects are made using the ` solarsoft ` procedure ` sp_prep ` which calculates the wavelength - integrated stokes  @xmath1 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the sign of the blue peak , @xmath34 is the line center , and @xmath35pm the procedure includes also a milne - eddington - based calibration of the sum of @xmath31 from both lines into a measure of longitudinal `` apparent flux density '' , @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this calibration is tailored to retrieve the field value from weak and noisy internetwork signals .",
    "it assumes that magnetic structures are spatially resolved ( fill the resolution element ) and does not take into account the magnetic field variations over the height range where lines are formed .",
    "consequences of the latter assumption are studied in the next section , when @xmath36 , obtained from stokes  @xmath1 profiles synthesized from simulations , is compared with the vertical component of the actual magnetic field .",
    "[ [ sec : pdfs ] ]    a marked difference exists between the pdfs inferred from zeeman polarimetry ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the pdfs from numerical computations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for example , in fig .",

    "the observation also shows greater intermittency ( the distribution has an enhanced strong signal ( field ) tail when compared to a gaussian ) than the simulation .",
    "this can possibly be attributed to the much lower reynolds number of the numerical simulation compared to the sun as well as to the smaller simulation box : contributions from dynamo action in the deeper layers and supergranular network flux concentrations are absent . to address the qualitative difference ( peaked versus monotonic ) between simulations and observations",
    ", we ask what pdf of zeeman - based observational signatures would result if pdf@xmath38 monotonically decreases with increasing vertical field strength ( instead of possessing a peak )",
    ". our approach will be to assume the distribution of field strengths from turbulent ` muram ` simulations and examine the consequences of such a distribution on stokes  @xmath1 observations .",
    "though noise , resolution , and other instrumental factors are important in any real observation , we first address the question assuming a `` perfect '' instrument . using the synthetic profiles from run c - ng ,",

    "though @xmath39 and @xmath40 are well correlated , there is a large scatter .",
    "we note , also , that changing the range to @xmath44 $ ] does not significantly affect the correlation , @xmath45 .",

    "the pdfs for maximum stokes  @xmath1 amplitude and total circular polarization are qualitatively similar to that shown for @xmath39 .",
    "pdfs for the vertical magnetic field from different volumes and 2d cross sections from all simulation runs , chosen either by height or by optical depth , show similar pdfs to that shown for @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the monotonically decreasing distribution is a robust feature of the vertical magnetic field when sampled by geometrical height , optical depth , or by averaging over the vertical direction .",
    "the difference between observations and simulations is caused by the radiative transfer that produces circular polarization from longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "the above result shows that caution is needed when interpreting the distribution of stokes  @xmath1 signal in order to avoid a drastic underestimation of the occurrence of weak field .",
    "this caution naturally extends to moments of the distribution such as mean vertical flux density or mean vertical magnetic energy density .",
    "for example , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are very well correlated with a coefficient of linearity of unity , but their averages , @xmath48 g and @xmath49 g , differ significantly .",
    "we see that an over estimation of 26% results from assuming the vertical magnetic field to have the same distribution as the signal derived from stokes  @xmath1 , even in the absence of noise    to understand in more detail how radiative transfer affects contribute to a peaked pdf , we examine a few selected @xmath50profiles . pixels with weak @xmath40 must be generating strong @xmath39 signals for pdf(@xmath39 ) to become peaked .",

    "[ fig : sami ] where we plot the mean @xmath39 for all pixels with @xmath51 g versus the strength of the vertical velocity fluctuations .",
    "there is a clear trend of stronger signal with increased doppler shifts between the different heights in the atmosphere .",

    "( [ eq : pdf ] ) ) .",
    "hence , their convolution is zero at zero and peaks instead for some finite positive value .",

    "this the location of strong horizontal fields not in the lanes but near the edges of granules @xcite . in resolving the details over the location and strength of the mean components of the magnetic field , future work should also address the cancellation statistics of the horizontal field ( and the linearly - polarized stokes signals @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) as well as the effect on stokes  @xmath1 presented here .",
    "on the basis of surface dynamo simulations , we have demonstrated that the pdf generated from the stokes  @xmath1 spectra are not necessarily equivalent in form to that of the pdf of the vertical component of the underlying magnetic field .",
    "the pdf for stokes  @xmath1 shows a reduction of likelihood for weak vertical magnetic field compared to the pdf of the field itself .",
    "this effect is not due to a reduction in horizontal resolution , but is caused by a combination of vertical radiative transfer through a turbulent fluid ( via the doppler effect ) and noise .",
    "that is , any systematic sampling ( by geometrical height , optical depth , or volume ) of @xmath57 from the simulation yields a monotonic pdf , due to doppler shifts between different atmospheric heights , the stokes @xmath1 signal is not such a systematic sampling .",
    "consequently , the pdf of stokes @xmath1 field estimates do not accurately represent the pdf of the actual vertical magnetic field a monotonic pdf for the field can result in a peaked pdf in observations and the assumption that pdf(@xmath57 ) can be uniquely derived from stokes  @xmath1 observations becomes dubious .    from the cancellation function for a _ hinode _ observation of the apparent longitudinal flux density",
    ", we have demonstrated that the multi - fractal self - similar pattern of the quiet - sun photospheric magnetic field covers two decades of length scales down to the resolution limit , @xmath5 km .",
    "this constitutes observational evidence that the the smallest scale of magnetic structuring in the photosphere is the power law also allows us to constrain the quiet - sun true mean unsigned vertical flux density .",
    "we estimate the lower bound to be @xmath141 g .",
    "estimates based solely on our numerical simulations suggest that the vertical unsigned flux at _ hinode _ s resolution should be multiplied by 5 to obtain the true vertical unsigned flux ( i.e. , @xmath3 g ) .",
    "these two results are consistent and suggest that the order of magnitude disparity between hanle and zeeman - based estimates may be fully resolved by a proper consideration of the cancellation properties of the full vector field .",
