    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are known to be powered by a supermassive black hole with an accretion disk .",
    "the spectra of agns are characterized by a nonthermal featureless continuum with prominent emission lines exhibiting a large range of ionization and excitation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one classification of agns can be made based on the width of emission lines .",
    "type 1 agns show broad permitted lines and semi - forbidden lines with a typical width of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to these broad emission lines they also show narrow forbidden lines with a width @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to this , type 2 agns exhibit only narrow emission lines encompassing both permitted and forbidden lines .",
    "@xcite proposed that the location of the broad line region can be observationally constrained by monitoring the flux of emission lines that vary in response to the changes of continuum flux .",
    "the time delay is directly translated into the size of the broad emission line region , which is also used to estimate the mass of the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reverberation mapping shows that the broad emission line region is located within @xmath8 from the central engine , whereas the narrow emission lines do not exhibit flux variations correlated with the neighboring continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a typical agn unification model proposes that an optically and geometrically thick component resides between the broad emission line region and the narrow emission line region , hindering the observers in the equatorial direction from viewing the broad line region .",
    "spectropolarimetry can be an efficient tool to verify this unification scheme , because we expect the broad emission lines may be seen in the polarized spectra in the presence of a scattering medium in the polar direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the prototypical type 2 seyfert galaxy , ngc 1068 , shows broad balmer lines in the polarized flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a similar observation was made for the narrow line radio galaxy cyg a by @xcite , in which an extremely broad h@xmath0 line was found in the polarized flux .",
    "broad absorption line quasars ( balqs ) , constituting about 10 percent of quasars , exhibit broad absorption troughs in the blue part of permitted broad lines .",
    "the exact nature of the absorbing media being controversial , one suggestion is that broad absorption lines are formed in the equatorial outflow that is driven radiatively by quasar luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case the broad troughs will not be completely black but filled partially by photons resonantly scattered in other lines of sight ( e.q .",
    "spectropolarimetry is also applied to find polarized residual fluxes in the broad absorption troughs in a number of balqs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the presence of an optically thick component",
    ", it is expected that far uv radiation can be inelastically scattered by neutral hydrogen , which may result in scattered radiation in the visible and ir regions .",
    "raman scattering by atomic hydrogen was first introduced by @xcite , when he identified the broad features around @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these mysterious broad features are found in about half of symbiotic stars , wide binary systems consisting of an active white dwarf and a mass losing giant ( e.q .",
    "the broad 6825 and 7082 emission features are formed through raman scattering of o  vi@xmath111032 and 1038 , when the scattering hydrogen atom in the ground state before incidence finally de - excites to the @xmath12 state .",
    "the cross sections of raman scattering for o  vi@xmath111032 and 1038 are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , where @xmath15 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "due to the small scattering cross section , the operation of raman scattering by atomic hydrogen requires a large amount of neutral hydrogen that is illuminated by the far uv emission source .",
    "however , the cross section increases sharply as the incident wavelength approaches those of lyman series transition of hydrogen due to resonance .",
    "the energy conservation requires the wavelength @xmath16 of the raman scattered radiation to be related to the incident wavelength @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the wavelength of ly@xmath0 .",
    "this relation immediately leads to the following @xmath20 which dictates that the raman features have a large width broadened by the factor @xmath21 . in the case of raman scattering of o",

    ", raman scattering of continuum photons in the vicinity of ly@xmath1 may form broad features around h@xmath0 .",
    "this mechanism has been invoked to explain broad h@xmath0 wings prevalent in symbiotic stars @xcite .",
    "lee & yun ( 1998 ) also discussed polarized h@xmath0 through raman scattering in active galactic nuclei , where neutral regions may be thicker than those found in symbiotic stars .",
    "the next section provides summary of the atomic physics involving raman scattering by atomic hydrogen .",
    "subsequently we provide our model for computation of broad balmer and paschen wings with our simulated results .",
    "a brief discussion is provided before conclusion .",
    "the exact nature of the thick absorbing component surrounding the broad emission line region in agns is still controversial .",
    "x - ray observation can be an excellent tool to probe the physical properties of the intrinsic absorber in agns .",
    "one such study performed using _ suzaku _ by @xcite reported the column density of hydrogen @xmath24 in the type 2 quasar iras  09104 + 4109 . in the presence of this thick neutral hydrogen , the rayleigh and raman scattering optical depth for radiation in the vicinity lyman series can be quite significant .",
    "the scattering of light by an atomic electron is described by the second order time dependent perturbation theory .",
    "we consider an incident photon with angular frequency @xmath25 with the polarization vector @xmath26 scattered by an electron in the initial state @xmath27 , which subsequently de - excites to the final state @xmath28 accompanied by the emission of an outgoing photon with angular frequency @xmath29 with polarization vector @xmath30 .",
    "the energy conservation requires that the difference of the photon energy @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the energy of the initial and final states @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath34 , the emergent raman lines are classified into stokes and anti - stokes lines .",

    "one way to do this is to compute the ratio @xmath64 of the number of raman photons blueward of line center to that redward of line center . in table  3",
    "we show our result .",
    "in the case of h@xmath0 , the red wing part extends further away from the h@xmath0 center than the blue wing , which is clearly seen by the fact that @xmath65 is less than 1 .",
    "this phenomenon is mainly due to the higher branching ratio for photons redward of ly@xmath1 than their blue counterparts .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed for the pa@xmath0 wings due to increasing branching ratio redward of ly@xmath66 .",
    "however , in the case of h@xmath1 we note that @xmath67 exceeds unity implying that the blue wing is stronger than the red part . this behavior is attributed to the much stronger total cross section in the blue part than in the red part near ly@xmath66 , despite the slow increase of the branching ratio as wavelength .",
    "another way of investigating asymmetry is to identify the half - value locations from a reference raman flux value .",
    "taking the simulated raman flux per unit wavelength at the h@xmath0 line center as a reference value , the half values appear at @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "a similar analysis for h@xmath1 wings shows that the corresponding doppler factors are @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "pa@xmath0 wings are much wider and the doppler factors corresponding to the half - core values are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .      , h@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 ( upper , middle and bottom panel , respectively ) for various column densities @xmath74 ranging from @xmath75 to @xmath76 . as @xmath74 increases",

    "we vary the number density of h  i in such a way that the neutral column density @xmath2 in the lateral direction becomes @xmath80 and @xmath76 .",
    "because the covering factor of the neutral scattering region is fixed and the total scattering optical depth is very large near line core , the raman flux at line center remains the same for various values of @xmath2 .",
    "the primary effect of varying @xmath2 is the width of the raman wings , in that the width is roughly proportional to @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath90 is the ratio of the height and the thickness of the cylindrical shell . ]    with @xmath91 the wing profiles are smooth . even though not shown in the figure",
    ", we checked that there appears an inclined plateau around line center in each raman wing for @xmath92 , implying the saturation behavior .",
    "as the covering factor increases , more far uv photons are incident into the scattering region leading to stronger raman scattering wings .",
    "when @xmath27 is small , the raman wing strength is approximately linearly proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "however if @xmath27 exceeds 2 , the wing strength increases very slowly and approaches a limiting value .",
    "given @xmath27 we normalize the h@xmath0 raman wing strengths by dividing the total number of raman h@xmath0 wing photons by that for @xmath87 .",
    "the wing strengths for h@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 are normalized in a similar way . in fig .",
    "[ width_cov ] , we plot the normalized wing strengths for h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 by triangles , circles and squares , respectively . given @xmath27 and @xmath74 , the normalized strengths are almost equal to each other for h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 wings . for reference , we add the solid curve to show the covering factor of the scattering region given by @xmath93 the covering factor also shows a similar behavior of linearity for small @xmath27 and approaching unity for large @xmath27 .",
    "significant deviations between the normalized raman wing strengths and the covering factor are attributed to complicated effects of multiple scattering and branching channels associated with the formation of raman wings .      in order to assess the observational feasibility we produce a mock spectrum around balmer lines by superposing the wing profiles onto artificially produced h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 broad emission lines . in fig .",
    "[ mock_spect ] , we show our result . in the production of the mock spectrum we assumed that the continuum level around ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath66 is given by the fixed value of @xmath94 and that the continuum between h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 is given in such a way that @xmath95 .",
    "we also set the luminosity distance @xmath96 .     and h@xmath1 with raman scattering wings .",
    "the gray line shows raman wings generated through a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the vertical scale is logarithmic for clear view of raman wings against prominent emission lines . ]    with no established line profiles of the balmer emission lines in agns , we take a gaussian profile of width @xmath6 for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission lines .",
    "we set the equivalent widths of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 broad emission lines to be 200 and 50  , respectively . the scattering geometry is taken so that @xmath97 and @xmath98 with @xmath99 .    in the figure",
    "the vertical scale is logarithmic and the raman wings are shown by gray solid lines . in the case of h@xmath1 , the raman wings are inconspicuous because the broad emission component dominates the relatively narrow raman h@xmath1 wings .",
    "however , the raman h@xmath0 wings are sufficiently wide to be observationally detectable .",
    "it is an interesting possibility that type 2 agns may also show detectable raman h@xmath1 wings , which will be seen outside of the narrow h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "in this article we produced raman wing profiles expected around h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 that are formed by far uv continuum radiation scattered in a thick neutral region surrounding the central engine .",
    "the strengths of raman wings are mainly determined by the product of the covering factor and the neutral column density of the scattering region .",
    "the wing width is approximately proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "we also provide a mock spectrum by superposing simulated raman wings onto artificially generated broad emission lines of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 .",
    "observationally the raman wings are difficult to discern from the underlying continuum because of their large width .",
    "another issue may be that broad wings can also be formed from thomson scattering or hot tenuous fast wind that emits balmer and paschen line photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "one distinguishing aspect of the raman wings is the differing widths and profiles exhibited by h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and pa@xmath0 because of the complicated atomic physics .",
    "if the wings are formed in an emission region moving very fast , then all the wings are expected to show similar widths and profiles .",
    "another important characteristic is the linear polarization because the scattering mechanism is exactly the e-1 process , which also characterizes the thomson scattering ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "performed spectropolarimetry of the prototypical narrow line radio galaxy cyg  a using the keck  ii telescope , in which they discovered extremely broad h@xmath0 in the polarized flux .",
    "the full width at half - maximum of polarized h@xmath0 is @xmath100 .",
    "if this huge width is attributed to dust scattering or free electron scattering , one may need to assume that the velocity scale of the hidden broad line region is roughly the same value of @xmath100 . in this case",
    ", the relativistic beaming inevitably leads to very asymmetric profiles with the blue part much stronger than the red part .    on the other hand ,",
    "very broad features around h@xmath0 are naturally formed through raman scattering of far uv radiation without invoking extreme kinematics in the broad emission line region .",
    "for example , if we assume that the central engine of cyg  a is surrounded by a cold thick region with @xmath101 the width of @xmath100 can be explained . in this case , we have to assume that the continuum around ly@xmath66 is relatively weak compared to that around ly@xmath1 in order to explain no detection of the polarized broad features around h@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it is highly noticeable that @xcite proposed a neutral column density of @xmath102 from their observations of _ nustar _ of cyg  a. despite the difficulty in identifying the broad wings around emission lines from the local continuum , they will provide important clues to the unification model of agns .",
