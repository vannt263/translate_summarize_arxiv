    "gravitationally lensed quasars play important roles not only in investigating the physical properties of lens galaxies but also in extracting cosmological information and constraining the structure of quasar accretion disks ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "our current sample is now large enough for the statistical errors on cosmological parameters to be comparable to the present level of the systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
