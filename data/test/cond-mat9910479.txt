    "several different probes have been used to investigate the properties of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the quantum hall regime , transport and optical experiments , or equilibrium methods including capacitance and magnetization measurements , to name only few .",
    "the magnetization of high mobility homogeneous 2deg has been measured by two methods .",
    "one method uses sensitive mechanical , torque magnetometers.@xcite more recently , a low - noise superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) has also been used.@xcite these precision measurements reveal many - body effects such as the exchange enhancement at odd filling factors @xcite and the fractional quantum hall effect and , in addition , an unidentified effect around filling factor @xmath0 that might be connected to skyrmions.@xcite    these experimental techniques are expected to be used soon for measuring the magnetization in lateral superlattices .",
    "the magnetization has been calculated for a disordered homogeneous 2deg within the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa)@xcite and within a statistical model for inhomogeneities corresponding to a hartree approximation ( ha ) .",
    "@xcite the results show strong exchange effects , already observed in experiments , @xcite and manifestations of the screening properties of the 2deg .    concerning periodic systems , the magnetization and the persistent current",
    "have been calculated by kotlyar et .",
    "for a finite array of quantum dots using a mott - hubbard model for the electron - electron interactions , both intra - dot and inter - dot.@xcite in an infinite lateral superlattice , defined by a potential periodic in two directions ( electric modulation ) the energy spectrum in the presence of a magnetic field can only be calculated when the ratio of the magnetic flux through a lattice cell to the unit flux quantum , @xmath1 , is a rational number .",
    "the unit cell can then be enlarged to have an integer number of flux quanta flowing through it.@xcite in principle , the magnetization of a 2deg in a lateral superlattice can be evaluated in the thermodynamic limit as the negative derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetic field @xmath2,@xcite since the energy spectrum is always a continuous function of the flux .",
    "@xcite the inclusion of the coulomb interaction to the model , within a self - consistent scheme such as the ha @xcite or the hfa,@xcite does severely limit the possibility to effectively change the value of @xmath2 by a small amount in order to take a numerical derivative .",
    "nevertheless , such a thermodynamic calculation can be done for a modulation that varies only along one spatial direction , i.  e.  for an array of quantum wires .    in this paper",
    "we shall evaluate the magnetization of a 2deg in a periodic potential corresponding to a weak density modulation in both , or in only one spatial direction .",
    "in other words our system is either an array of dots or antidots , or of parallel quantum wires , in most cases with a strong overlap .",
    "we first consider a finite system with boundaries , and then the unbound system .    for the finite system we are able to calculate the total magnetization . for the infinite system with a 2d potential we shall rather use the definition applicable to a mesoscopic system with a phase coherence length @xmath3 much larger than the spatial period of the square unit cell @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear to us that in this manner we are calculating the contribution to the magnetization due to the periodic modulation , neglecting the contribution stemming from the edge of a real system . in an experiment",
    "the total magnetization is indeed measured and we would have a hard time arguing that the edge contribution is statistically insignificant in the thermodynamic limit . our way out of this dilemma is to compare several results that we can obtain .",
    "first , we compare the results for the finite system of various sizes , by heuristically separating the contribution of the bulk and edge current distributions to the total magnetization .",
    "second , we compare quantitatively and qualitatively the bulk contribution in the finite system to the magnetization produced by one unit cell in the infinite system .",
    "we point out that experimentally it may be possible to measure only the contribution to the magnetization caused by the periodic modulation by placing the entire squid - loop well within the sample . and third , we compare to the total thermodynamic magnetization of an infinite system which is periodic in only one spatial direction and thus not subject to commensurability difficulties .",
    "our calculations show that the bulk contributions to the magnetization are strongly dependent on the presence or absence of the exchange interaction in the models supporting the view of meinel et .",
    "that magnetization is an ideal probe of the many - body effects in a 2deg.@xcite magnetization has been calculated for quantum hall systems in the fractional regime with higher order approximations that reproduce more reliably exchange and correlation effects.@xcite here we focus our attention on relatively large structured systems with several landau bands included and have thus to resort to the hfa in order to make the calculation tractable in cpu - time .",
    "recent comparison between results from exact numerical diagonalization and the hfa show that in high landau levels the two approaches agree on the formation of charge density waves.@xcite    we shall consider periodic potentials of a short period , 50 nm , which means short with respect to the present technical possibilities , but still realistic . in this case , for gaas parameters and for magnetic fields in the range of few tesla , the screening effects due to the direct columb interaction are weak .",
    "however , the exchange effects remain strong , and they amplify the single - particle energy dispersion.@xcite therefore the presence of the periodic potential should become proeminent in the magnetization even for weak amplitudes . and last , but not least , by avoiding strong screening we are benefitted by a shorter computational time .",
    "the magnetization is calculated within three models in the paper , self - consistently with respect to the electron - electron coulomb interaction : a finite model using the ha , an infinite model periodic in both spatial directions , using the unrestricted hartree fock approximation ( uhfa ) , and an infinite model periodic in only one spatial direction , using the standard hfa .",
    "the model for a finite system consists of a laterally confined 2deg .",
    "a hard wall potential ensures that the electrons stay in the square region @xmath5 the wave functions being zero at the boundary .",
    "an external modulating potential and a perpendicular magnetic field are applied .",
    "the potential has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 count the number of dots in @xmath9 and @xmath10 direction respectively , giving in total @xmath11 unit cells .",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved by expanding the eigenfunctions in fourier sine - series and the expansion coefficients are found by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the electron interaction is taken into account in the hartree approximation .",
    "the total magnetization can be calculated according to the definition for the orbital and the spin component of the magnetization,@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total area of the system .",
    "the equilibrium local current is evaluated as the quantum thermal average of the current operator , @xmath14 with velocity operator @xmath15/m^*$ ] , * a * being the vector potential .",
    "even though the magnetic field @xmath2 can be varied freely in this model we have used the definition of the orbital magnetization ( [ m_os ] ) rather than evaluating the derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "the two - dimensional modulation of the system is a square lattice of quantum dots ( @xmath16 ) or antidots ( @xmath17 ) determined by the static external potential @xmath18 or a simple cosine - modulation defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the length of the fundamental inverse lattice vectors , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the bravais lattice defined by @xmath23 or @xmath24 has a periodic length @xmath4 and the inverse lattice is spanned by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "the commensurability condition between the magnetic length @xmath27 and the period @xmath4 requires magnetic - field values of the form @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 the magnetic flux quantum.@xcite arbitrary rational values can , in principle , be obtained by resizing the unit cell in the bravais lattice .    for this model",
    "we evaluate the contribution of the periodic modulation to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , rather than the total magnetization . using in eq.([m_os ] ) the periodicity of the current and spin densities , and the reflection symmetry of the unit cell , we reduce the integrations to a single cell . obviously , in the absence of the modulation @xmath33 and the orbital contribution vanishes .",
    "the ground - state properties of the interacting 2deg in a perpendicular homogeneous magnetic field @xmath34 and the periodic potential are calculated within the uhfa for the coulomb interacting electrons at a finite temperature.@xcite the approximation is unrestricted in the sense that the single - electron states do not have to be eigenstates of @xmath35 .",
    "the modulation is defined by the potential @xmath36 describing an array of parallel quantum wires . in this case",
    "there is no restriction on the magnetic - field values , the magnetic flux through one lattice cell always being infinite .",
    "the groundstate is calculated in the hfa , by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the landau basis , and by expanding the matrix elements in fourier series .",
    "therefore we can evaluate directly the total magnetization @xmath37 by the thermodynamic formula appropriate for the canonical ensemble , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total energy , and @xmath40 the entropy .",
    "we shall assume the temperature is sufficiently low to neglect the second term of eq .",
    "( [ thermodeq ] ) . in view of more realistic results",
    "we also assume a small disorder broadening of the landau levels , which we take into account with a gaussian model for the spectral function.@xcite",
    "the numerical calculations are performed with gaas parameters , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . in the case of the infinite periodic modulation , in the uhfa , hfa , or the ha ,",
    "the bare @xmath20-factor is -0.44 , and is set equal to zero in the model of the finite 2deg in the ha .",
    "mostly for numerical reasons we keep a finite temperature , which for the models with 2d potential is 1 k , and for the 1d potential is 0.2 k. in all cases the length of the unit cell is @xmath43 nm .",
    "the magnetization for the finite system is shown in fig.[mag_tot_sie ] .",
    "the system size is progressively increased , starting from a single cell of 50@xmath4450 nm@xmath45 , to a system of 5@xmath445 cells , keeping the unit - cell size constant .",
    "each cell is defined by one period of the modulation potential ( [ v_sq ] ) .",
    "when the system consists of more than one cell we , ad hoc , divide the magnetization into an edge part @xmath46 with a contribution only from the first row of cells around the system , and a bulk part @xmath47 with the contribution from the rest of the cells .",
    "below we shall see that generally , the magnetization @xmath47 does approach the orbital magnetization expected for a large system as the number of cells @xmath48 is increased .",
    "the variable on the @xmath9-axis of the figure , @xmath49 , i.  e.  the number of electrons in a single cell , can approximately be interpreted as a filling factor for the 3@xmath443 and the 5@xmath445 system .",
    "this is confirmed by the evolution of the chemical potential @xmath50 through the single electron hartree - states depicted in fig .",
    "[ ehns_tot_sie ] . for even - integer values of @xmath49 @xmath50 jumps through gaps of sparsely distributed edge states separating states concentrated into precursors of landau bands .",
    "the bulk @xmath47 and the edge @xmath46 contributions to the magnetization as well as the total magnetization are of similar magnitudes .",
    "however the oscillations of @xmath47 around zero are more symmetric than those of @xmath46 .",
    "this is because the direction of the edge current is more commonly as expected from the classical clockwise motion of the electrons around the sample , thus giving a preferred sign to @xmath46 . modestly increasing the size , from 3@xmath443 to 5@xmath445 unit cells ,",
    "clearly gives the finite system more of the character of an extended system .",
    "the bulk magnetization for the large system is small when @xmath51 is not close to even integers due to the strong screening of the modulation potential away from the edges of the system .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ mag_tot_0_sie ] showing @xmath31 of the noninteracting 5@xmath445 system .",
    "the structures around even integer values of @xmath51 are less steep than for the interacting system . in the presence of the interaction the energy gaps are reduced by screening , which is self - consistently determined by the density of states around @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath50 lies within one band ( i.  e.  @xmath51 is not an even integer ) the coulomb repulsion forces the electron density to spread out more evenly shifting the  effective filling  @xmath49 a small amount .",
    "a slight change in the magnetic flux in the finite system only shifts the relation between the number of electrons and the effective filling factor.@xcite    the current distribution for a 5@xmath445 system is shown in fig .",
    "[ curr_sie ] which reveals a strong edge current , but also a bulk current structured self - consistently in a complex way by the modulation , the interaction , and the location of @xmath50 with respect to the energy levels .",
    "this interplay of complex bulk contributions with the effects of the edge currents opens the question what are the effects of a modulation in an extended electron system on the magnetization .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the infinite system , that is modulated in two directions , and calculate the contribution to the magnetization from one unit cell . in fig .",
    "[ e_tot_cos_pq2 ] the total energy is shown as a function of the filling factor @xmath51 for the extended periodic 2deg in the uhfa and the ha for the case @xmath52 .",
    "two magnetic flux quanta flow through the unit cell and each landau band is split into two subbands which in turn are doubly spin split .",
    "filling factor two means thus that both spin states of one landau band are occupied , and in total four subbands are below the fermi level . the modulation with @xmath53 or",
    "0.1 mev is small compared to @xmath54 mev .",
    "the minima in the total energy for the uhfa reflect the strong exchange interaction for electrons , added to nearly filled landau bands or subbands thereof .",
    "[ m_cos_pq2 ] compares the total magnetization , eq .",
    "( [ m_os ] ) , and its components @xmath31 and @xmath32 calculated within the uhfa , with the total magnetization according to the ha .",
    "the main difference between the results of these two approximations is the sharp reduction in the magnetization caused by the exchange interaction around odd integer filling factors . in this region",
    "the enhanced spin splitting of the subbands is larger than the subband splitting caused by the modulation .",
    "the order of the subbands ( with respect to spin and magnetic subband index ) and their curvature thus leads to @xmath31 being of same sign for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the behavior is thus different around the even and odd values of @xmath51 .",
    "later we see that this is not in the case of @xmath57 . just like for the total energy the different modulation strengths result in minor changes in @xmath31 , because the energy dispersion of the landau bands is determined by the exchange energy rather than by the external or screened potentials .",
    "@xcite    the light effective mass and the small @xmath20-factor of electrons in gaas cause the spin contribution @xmath32 to be an order of magnitude smaller than the orbital one .",
    "a comparison of @xmath32 in these two approximations can be seen in fig .",
    "[ s_mu_pq2 ] . in the case of the uhfa",
    "the exchange interaction always leads to the maximum spin polarization .",
    "in the ha the spin splitting of the landau bands is only the bare zeeman gap , here about 0.07 mev , i.  e.   much smaller than the intra - band energy dispersion which is of the order of the modulation amplitude , @xmath58 mev .",
    "therefore the chemical potential is never able to lie only in one spin subband .",
    "new electrons are being added to the system concurrently , to both spin states , resulting in a reduced polarization .    in the case of one flux quantum through a unit cell ( @xmath57 ) each landau band consists of only two subbands , with different spin quantum numbers .",
    "this simpler band structure is reflected in the magnetization ( see fig.[m_v01_pq1 ] ) . here the spin - bands hosting @xmath50 for the filling range @xmath59 and @xmath60 have opposite curvature causing a maximum and a minimum in @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "for the lower @xmath51 range the fermi level ( @xmath50 ) is in the lower spin subband of the second landau - band pair , see fig .",
    "[ ebpq1 ] . here",
    "the fermi contours (  fermi surface  ) encircle the energy maxima at the edges of the brillouin - zone ( hole orbits ) , while for the higher @xmath51 range they close around the minimum of the upper spin subband ( electron orbits ) .    in the case of two flux quanta each landau band is fourfold split as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ebpq2 ] . for @xmath61",
    "only the splitting due to the modulation is clearly visible but for @xmath51 not equal to an even integer the spin splitting gets more enhanched due to the strong exchange force .",
    "furthermore , we see that the subbands repel each other around the @xmath62 point ( center of the brillouin zone ) resulting in a different occurrence as @xmath51 is swept from 2.8 to to 3.3 .",
    "in contrast to the strong @xmath51-dependent interaction effects on the energy spectra we show in fig .",
    "[ eb0 ] the  static  energy bands of the noninteracting system that are independent of @xmath51 and the location of @xmath50 .    around @xmath63",
    "the order of the landau subbands is unusual .",
    "the states below the fermi level are those of the landau subband @xmath64 , @xmath65 being the orbital and @xmath66 the spin quantum numbers . but",
    "the landau subbands above , i.  e.  @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are overlapped due to the strong exchange enhancement of the gaps between all the subbands with the same @xmath65 but opposite @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the first states which are populated for @xmath69 belong to the subband @xmath68 , while the subband @xmath67 is populated a bit later ( for slightly higher @xmath51 ) .",
    "this situation is well known in the atomic physics of complex atoms , and has also been demonstrated in quantum dots , with a current - spin density - functional approach,@xcite which in principle is more reliable than our uhfa . in our case",
    "we observe this spin - state inversion as a small anomaly in @xmath32 around @xmath63 , fig .",

    "[ m_v5_qad_pq2 ] , where @xmath70 for a dot and an antidot modulation of the same strength are mirror symmetric around zero for low @xmath51 . for higher @xmath51",
    "the mixing of the landau bands due to the coulomb interaction slightly skews the mirror symmetry . for a homogeneous system ( @xmath71 ) the persistent current in the definition of the magnetization ( [ m_os ] ) vanishes and thus @xmath31 .",
    "similar effect was seen for the bulk magnetization of the finite system in fig .",
    "[ mag_tot_sie ] for noninteger values of @xmath51 . due to the enhancement of subband",
    "width caused by the exchange force the transition to zero magnetization with decreasing modulation does not happen in a smooth linear fashion.@xcite      now we come back to the question how the magnetization of the finite and infinite system are related .",
    "the magnetization for the finite system can be calculated by either equation ( [ m_os ] ) or ( [ thermodeq ] ) giving the same results for the low temperature assumed here .",
    "the orbital magnetization @xmath31 is compared for the finite system of different sizes to the result for a single unit cell in an extended system with the same type of modulation in fig .",
    "[ m_samanb_1h ] , but with the interaction accounted for in different ways .",
    "if we first look at the results for the infinite periodic system we notice that the largest variation of @xmath72 occurs for the uhfa and the smallest for the ha with the noninteracting case inbetween .",
    "this is in accordance with the screening properties mentioned earlier , in the ha the modulation is screened more effectively than in the uhfa .",
    "this result is in agreement with the simplistically defined bulk magnetization @xmath47 of the finite system seen in fig .",
    "[ mag_tot_sie ] , the main difference being the sharp variation of @xmath47 at even integer values of @xmath51 .",
    "their presence indicates that even though the current density is only integrated over the  bulk  of the system the underlying energy spectrum is affected by the chemical potential @xmath50 traversing it s edge states . to be able to get the unit cell of the two different systems to give the same magnetization the finite system has to be even larger , exhausting our means of computation .",
    "the magnetization of both systems ( and also of the 1d modulated system , see the next subsection ) compares well with results derived from an older model of statistical inhomogeneities in a 2deg that was used to explain effects caused by oscillating landau level width due to the electrostatic screening.@xcite    the main differences between the magnetization of our finite and infinite periodic systems are : _ i _ ) the asymmetry around the zero line in the case of the finite system , and _ ii _ ) the missing steepness of @xmath31 around even integer filling factors @xmath51 for the infinite system .",
    "earlier we saw that the asymmetry is influenced by the contribution from the  edge  of the finite system .",
    "the second difference can also be traced to the edge states . in the extended model",
    "there are no edge states between the landau subbands .",
    "their shape and curvature can thus change sharply with the motion of the chemical potential @xmath50 through them , the self - consistent screening and exchange effects minimize any gaps that might evolve around @xmath50 , which in turn prevents any sharp jumps in @xmath31 . with this in mind",
    "it is clear that _ the magnetization for a realistic ( large , but finite ) modulated system is not simply the sum of the magnetization produced by two independent subsystems , the edge and the bulk_. the coulomb interaction makes the separation of the contributions to @xmath70 a nontrivial problem , which can be solved only by an experiment . in addition , we have seen that the self - consistent motion of @xmath50 through the energy bands depends strongly on the approximation used for the electron interaction .",
    "we have noticed in our calculations that for the system sizes considered here the magnetization of the finite system is not strongly dependent on whether the modulation is assumed 2d as here , or 1d.@xcite for an infinite system with a 1d modulation we can calculate the thermodynamically defined magnetization ( [ thermodeq ] ) presented in fig .",
    "[ 1dmod ] . as mentioned before we see here that @xmath31 for the finite system , especially when it is enlarged , bears a strong similarity with @xmath31 for the infinite 1d modulated 2deg .",
    "the calculation of the ground state for a modulated 2deg with arbitrary magnetic fields is impossible for the 2d potential , due to the commensurability restrictions .",
    "the problem can be circumvented for a 1d modulated system that we shall now turn our attention to , and formulate predictions of experimental results that can be used to test the importance of the exchange interaction .",
    "for such a system we have access to the total magnetization , i.  e.  bulk plus edge , in the thermodynamic limit . in fig .",
    "[ 1dmod ] we display results for the infinite system with a 1d potential , obtained with eq .",
    "( [ thermodeq ] ) .",
    "first we show the sawtooth profile in the absence of a modulation potential , reflecting the instability of the fermi level in the energy gaps .",
    "the exchange interaction determines the spin splitting for odd filling factors , but also amplifies the jumps for even filling factors by almost a factor of two .",
    "the reason is the enhancement effect on both the spin gaps and the landau gaps .",
    "for the same reason , in the presence of a modulation the jumps are only slightly reduced .",
    "similarily , as for the 2d modulation , the exchange interaction also increases the energy dispersion of the landau bands for noninteger filling factors , by lowering the energy of the occupied states , see figs .",
    "[ ebpq1 ] and [ ebpq2 ] .",
    "hence , the band width depends on the position of the fermi level inside an energy band .",
    "this fact prevents the coincidence of the fermi level with a band edge ( top or bottom ) , resulting in sharp cusps for @xmath51 close to integers .",
    "the sharpness is an effect of the exchange interaction in the vicinity of a van hove singularity .",
    "some amount of disorder may indeed broaden such cusps .",
    "in addition , the magnetization jumps may now slightly increase , because of the smearing of the band edges by disorder , which helps the fermi level to enter or to leave a landau band .",
    "when the fermi level lies in the middle of a band screening effects are important . in principle screening",
    "is important when the modulation period is much bigger than the magnetic length and/or when high landau bands , with extended wave functions , are occupied .",
    "however , even here we can see some oscillations in the upper bands , with orbital quantum number @xmath73 .",
    "increasing the modulation amplitude , from @xmath74 mev to @xmath75 mev we first see that the magnetization for the bands with @xmath76 is relatively stable . just like in figs .",
    "[ e_tot_cos_pq2 ] and [ m_cos_pq2 ] , this is because the exchange amplification of the energy dispersion depends on the filling factor , rather than on the modulation amplitude.@xcite the spin splitting survives now only for @xmath77 , and it is abruptly supressed for @xmath78 . a similar supression occurs for @xmath74 mev , but at a higher @xmath51 , and it can be explained by the inflation of the wave functions in high landau levels which rapidly equilibrates the number of spin - up and spin - down electrons and destroys the enhancement of the spin gap .",
    "@xcite such a suppression effect has been recently observed in magnetotransport experiments on short - period modulated systems , in the shubnikov - de haas peaks.@xcite",
    "we have calculated the magnetization of periodic systems and discussed with examples various properties of it due to system boundaries , periodicity , and coulomb interaction .",
    "we have compared the results of the finite and infinite systems and of the periodic systems in one and two spatial directions .",
    "our aim is to provide information for understanding the magnetization measurements in mesoscopic systems , which are expected to become a new direction of experimental investigations .    unlike in other types of experiments , like transport or electromagnetic absorption ,",
    "the magnetization measurements seem to open a better and more direct access to the intrinsic , quantum electronic structure of the system . in transport experiments",
    "this is often intermediated by complicated electron - impurity interactions , and in far - infrared absorption usually the classical collective motion of the electron system is dominant .",
    "we have identified in the magnetization several properties of the energy spectrum which are absent or incompletely observed in transport or absorption measuremens , like the exchange enhancement of the energy dispersion or the curvature of the landau bands . according to a recent prediction",
    "the exchange effects may also determine hysteresis properties when acting on the energy dispersion , either by varying the modulation amplitude , or by varying the zeeman splitting in tilted magnetic fields , and keeping the filling factor constant.@xcite the magnetization measurements could be the best suited tool for probing such effects .",
    "the present calculation further indicates that sought after delicate internal structure of the landau bands , such as the hofstadter butterfly,@xcite in a doubly periodic 2deg might be better observed by magnetization than transport experiments.@xcite this research was supported by the icelandic natural science foundation and the university of iceland research fund .",
