    "unoccupied spin - down mn3d bands lie in the semiconducting gap , close to the bottom of the conduction band .",

    "the comparison of the dos of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations for @xmath41 ( figs .",
    "[ fig_dos ] and [ fig_dos_afm ] ) shows that they are similar .",
    "the main difference in the antiferromagnetic dos is the appearance of a small energy gap which separates the upper part of the valence - band states from the rest of the valence band .",
    "the spin - splitting obtained in the ferromagnetic dos is present also in the antiferromagnetic dos as the splitting between the top of the separated ( impurity ) band and the top of the valence band .",
    "figures [ fig_dos_mn ] and [ fig_dos_afm ] show that the partial dos of the mn atoms are only weakly dependent on the magnetic configuration and preserve fully the local spin splitting .",
    "obviously the main features of the lda - dos can not be treated in terms of the stoner - like mean - field picture ( fig .",
    "[ fig_stoner ] ) .    to study in more details the relation between the electron structure and magnetic configuration we perform the analysis of the partial dos of the atoms of the semiconductor matrix .",

    "correspondingly , the net magnetization vary from maximal to zero .",

    "is directed along the net magnetization .",
    "the dos projected on the local atomic quantization axis provides , in most cases , better insight into the physics of the system .",
    "however , in the experiments determining the spin - splittings the spin - quantization axis is usually the global one .    the dos shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_se_i],[fig_se_ii ] reveal strong difference between two se atoms .",
    "the spin of the electron states of the se - i atom follows almost perfectly the spin of the neighboring mn atom ( fig .",

    "this is evidenced by the negligibly small local spin - down dos .",
    "the smallness of the local spin - down dos holds up to the largest angle between mn moments .",
    "considered from the viewpoint of the global quantization axis , both spin - up and spin - down dos of se - i have similar shape but different weights ( amplitudes ) . the relative weight of the spin - down dos increases from zero for @xmath46 to 1 for @xmath47 .",
    "because of the similarity of the form of the global spin - up and spin - down dos the variation of the dos with the change of the net magnetization can not be treated in terms of the varied spin - splitting .",
    "the changes in the global dos take the form of the redistribution of the weight between the spin - up and spin - down dos .",
    "this behavior is principally different from the behavior expected within the mean - field picture .    on the other hand , for se - ii",
    "we get a strong dependence of the local dos on the magnetic configuration of the mn moments ( fig .",
    "[ fig_se_ii ] ) . with increasing angle between mn moments the contribution of the spin - down dos increases .",
    "this happens because the spin of the states of se - ii deviates increasingly from the spin of the nearest mn atom responding to the influence of other mn atoms .",
    "now , the shape of the spin - up and spin - down dos calculated with respect to the global quantization axis differ strongly . to characterize this difference in terms of the spin - splitting we calculated the centers of gravity for both spin - dos in the energy region at the top of the valence band ( fig .",
    "[ fig_se_ii ] ) .    in a good approximation",
    "the spin - splitting is proportional to the net magnetization ( fig . [ fig_splitting ] )",
    "therefore the properties of the electron structure of se - ii can be described within the mean - field picture .",
    "since the relation between the exchange splitting and net magnetization varies from atom to atom , in experiments probing different parts of the electron structure this relation can appear different .",
    "important role in the experimental determination of the strength of the exchange interaction between the mn moments and valence band states in dms is played by the magneto - optical measurements of the spin splitting at the top of the valence band ( @xmath48 point of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig_jpd ] we show the calculated dependence of the splitting on mn concentration .",
    "the lda results for the exchange splitting at the @xmath48 point disagree with experiment in two respects .",

    "the lda - splitting is well described by a linear function with a finite value in the limit of @xmath49 .",
    "such form of the dependence is the result of the presence of the mn3d states at the fermi level .",
    "second , the exchange splitting is substantially larger than the splitting obtained experimentally .",
    "since the lda results can not be described within the mean - field picture the use of the formula @xmath50 gives values of the @xmath51 parameter that depend on concentration @xmath2 .",

    "this repulsion is an important factor leading , in agreement with experiment , to negative exchange splitting at the top of the valence band .",
    "note that in the lda calculation the negative exchange splitting has different origin : the presence of the spin - up mn3d states at the top of the valence band .    to study the relation between net magnetization and exchange splitting we performed calculation for the antiferromagnetic configuration of the mn moments for @xmath41 ( fig .",

    "this makes model ( [ tb - mat ] ) conceptually similar to our asw calculations .",
    "the property of the secular matrix ( [ tb - mat ] ) that is important for us reads @xmath79=2\\int_{\\rm bz } d{\\bf",
    "k}h_\\circ({\\bf k})\\ ] ] that is the trace of the matrix @xmath72 does not depend on the magnetic configuration .",
    "the variation of the magnetic structure changes the energy of individual electron states .",
    "the changes of different states , however , compensate . in the case",
    "the trace of the secular matrix represents the total energy of the system the invariance with respect to the magnetic configuration means that all effective interatomic exchange interactions are negligible .    the property given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : etot_full_bands ] ) applies to the total energy of a system if all bands described by the tight - binding secular matrix ( [ tb - mat ] ) are occupied .",
    "this condition can be fulfilled only in the case that the hybridization between the occupied and empty states is weak and can be neglected .",
    "the weakness of the hybridization allows to include into the secular matrix the occupied states only .",
    "an attempt to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : etot_full_bands ] ) for the explanation of the weakness of the superexchange in ( znmn)se leads immediately to the following difficulty . according to eq .",
    "( [ tb - mat ] ) both spin - up and spin - down mn 3d states must be included into the secular matrix to fulfill eq .",
    "( [ eq : etot_full_bands ] ) . since only the spin - up mn 3d states are occupied",
    ", the inclusion of the spin - down mn 3d states , apparently , does not allow to relate the trace of the matrix to the energy of the system . in the case of ( znmn)se",
    "this difficulty can , however , be overcome if we notice that the spin - down mn 3d states form very narrow energy bands lying in the semiconducting gap of znse ( figs .",
    "[ fig_dos],[fig_dos_u ] ) .",
    "for example , the estimation for the lda case shows that the states of these bands are strongly localized about the mn atoms : more than 76% is located in the mn spheres and more than 88% within the first coordination sphere of the zn atoms .",
    "these states can be treated as evanescent states that are unable to mediate efficiently the exchange interaction between mn atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] ) .",
    "the evanescent character of the empty mn 3d states allows to approximately consider their contribution into the trace of the secular matrix [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : etot_full_bands ] ) ] as being independent of the magnetic configuration .",
    "this has as a consequence that the contribution of the occupied states is also approximately independent of the magnetic configuration resulting in weak effective interatomic exchange interactions .",
    "this consideration allows us to also explain the difference between dms on the gaas and znse bases .",
    "the semiconducting energy gap is substantially larger in the case of znse . in the case of gaas",
    "the influence of empty states is stronger and they must be included into the secular matrix ( [ tb - mat ] ) .",
    "therefore , the property described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : etot_full_bands ] ) does not apply to the occupied states that results in stronger superexchange .",
    "some further comments are worth making here .",
    "first , the relation between the value of the semiconducting gap and the spatial extent of the exchange interactions has been many times discussed in the scientific literature within the framework of the perturbative treatment involving virtual transitions between the occupied states of the valence band and empty states of the conduction band ( see .",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an early publication on this topic .",
    "see also an interesting comment on the relation between the range of the exchange interaction and an imaginary fermi vector in recent paper by pajda et al @xcite ) .",
    "the model considered above captures basically the same physics by taking into account , in a non - perturbative manner , the hybridization between occupied and empty states . only in the case",
    "the contribution of this hybridization into the response of the valence band states on the change of magnetic configuration is small the interatomic exchange interactions are weak",
    ". an important feature of model ( [ tb - mat ] ) is that it reflects the properties of the non - perturbative technique we used in the calculation of the exchange interactions and , therefore , provides additional understanding of the calculational results .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of the ii - vi diluted magnetic semiconductor ( znmn)se is the giant spin splitting of the valence band states under application of the magnetic field ( giant zeeman splitting ) .",
    "this splitting reveals strong exchange interaction between mn moments and semiconductor states . on the other hand ,",
    "no magnetic phase transition has been observed for systems with small mn content up to very low temperatures .",
    "the latter property shows weakness of the exchange interaction between mn moments . in this paper , the local density approximation ( lda ) and the lda+u techniques are employed to study exchange interactions in ( znmn)se . supercell and frozen - magnon approaches applied earlier to iii - v diluted magnetic semiconductors are used .",
    "it is found that both lda and lda+u describe successfully the combination of the strong zeeman splitting and weak interatomic exchange .",
    "however , the physical pictures provided by two techniques differ strongly .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that lda+u method provides the description of the system which is much closer to the experimental data .",
