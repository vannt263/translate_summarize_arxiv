    "the study of spectra of graphs associated with finitely generated groups , such as cayley graphs or schreier graphs ( natural analogues of cayley graphs associated to not necessarily free group actions ) has a long history and is related to many problems in modern mathematics .",
    "still , very little is known about the dependence of the spectrum of the laplacian on the choice of generators in the group and on the weight on these generators . in the recent paper",
    "@xcite we addressed the issue of dependence on the weights on generators in the example of grigorchuk s group of intermediate growth .",
    "more specifically , we determined the spectral type of the laplacian on the schreier graphs describing the action of grigorchuk s group on the boundary of the infinite binary tree and showed that it is different in the isotropic and anisotropic cases .",
    "in fact , the spectrum is shown to be a cantor set of lebesgue measure zero in the anisotropic case , whereas , as has been known for a long time , it consists of one or two intervals in the isotropic case .",
    "moreover , we showed almost surely ( with respect to a natural measure on the boundary of the tree ) the absence of eigenvalues for the laplacians in question .",
    "our investigation in @xcite provides ( and relies on ) a surprising link between discrete schrdinger operators with aperiodic order and the substitutional dynamics arising from a presentation of the group by generators and relators .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we want to survey the spectral theoretic results of @xcite .",
    "secondly , we want to put these results in wider perspective by discussing the background on aperiodic order in dimension one . in this context",
    "we present a discussion of subshifts and aperiodic order in section [ section - subshifts ] and of schrdinger operators arising in models of ( dis)ordered solids in section [ schroedinger ] .",
    "we also continue our study of the substitution that is instrumental for the results in @xcite .",
    "it first appeared in 1985 in the presentation of grigorchuk s group by generators and relators found by lysenok @xcite ( such infinite recursive presentations are now called l - presentations ) .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the same substitution also describes basic dynamical properties of the group .",
    "here we review its combinatorial properties and carry out a detailed study of the factor map to its maximal equicontinuous factor , which is the binary odometer .",
    "this factor map is proven to be one - to - one everywhere except on three orbits .",
    "this in turn can be linked to the phenomenon of pure point diffraction which is at the core of aperiodic order .",
    "all these discussions concerning the substitution are contained in section [ the - substitution ] .",
    "the necessary background from graphs and dynamical systems is discussed in section [ section - background - graphs - etc ] and basics on grigorchuk s group and its schreier graphs can be found in section [ grigorchuk ] .",
    "the connection between schrdinger operators and laplacians on schreier graphs revealed in @xcite ( and reviewed in sections [ connecting ] and [ section - spectral ] ) can also be used to show that the kesten - von - neuman trace and the integrated density of states agree .",
    "this seems to be somewhat folklore .",
    "we provide a proof in section [ ids - schreier ] .",
    "our approach can certainly be carried out for various further families of groups generalizing grigorchuk s group . in particular",
    ", our results fully extend to a larger family of self - similar groups acting on the infinite binary tree considered by sunic in @xcite , as well as to similar families of self - similar groups acting on regular rooted trees of arbitrary degrees that also have linear schreier graphs for their action on the boundary of the tree .",
    "moreover , each of these self - similar groups belongs to an uncountable family of groups parametrized by sequences in a certain finite alphabet , in the same way as grigorchuk s group belongs to the family of groups @xmath0 constructed by the first named author in @xcite .",
    "the schreier graphs of the groups in the same family look the same , but their labelling by generators , and thus their spectra , depend on the sequence @xmath1 .",
    "the associated subshifts are also different , in particular , they do nt have to come from a substitution in the case when the corresponding group is not self - similar .",
    "this more general setup will be considered in a separate paper .",

    "long range aperiodic order ( or aperiodic order for short ) denotes an intermediate regime of order between periodicity and randomness .",
    "it has received a lot of attention over the last thirty years or so , see e.g. the article collections and monographs @xcite .",
    "this interest in aperiodic order has various reasons . on the one hand",
    "it is due to the many remarkable and previously unknown features and phenomena arising from aperiodic order in various branches of mathematics . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also due to the relevance of aperiodic order in physics and chemistry . indeed",
    ", aperiodic order provides a mathematical theory for the description of a new type of matter discovered in 1982 by shechtman via diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments showed sharp peaks in the diffraction pattern indicating long range order and at the same time a five fold symmetry indicating absence of periodicity .",
    "the discovery of solids combining both long range order with aperiodicity came as a complete surprise to physicists and chemists and shechtman was honored with a nobel prize in 2011 . by now , the solids in question are known as quasicrystals .    in one dimension",
    "aperiodic order is commonly modeled by subshifts of low complexity . in higher dimensions",
    "it is modeled by dynamical systems consisting of point sets with suitable regularity features ( which are known as delone dynamical systems ) . here ,",
    "we present the necessary notation in order to deal with the one - dimensional situation .",
    "* when we speak about aperiodic order subsequently , this will always mean that we have a subshift with suitable minimality features at our disposal .",
    "*    let a finite set @xmath5 be given .",
    "we call @xmath5 the _ alphabet _ and refer to its elements as _ letters_. we will consider the set @xmath6 of finite words ( including the empty word ) over the alphabet @xmath5 , viewed as a free monoid ( with the multiplication given by concatenation of words and the empty word representing the identity ) .",
    "elements of @xmath6 will often be written as @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the length of a word is the number of its letters .",
    "it will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the empty word has length zero .",

    "the set @xmath12 denotes the set of functions from @xmath13 to @xmath5 . we think of its elements of one - sided infinite words over @xmath5 .",
    "they will often be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 are finite words and @xmath16 satisfies @xmath17 we write @xmath18 and say that @xmath19 _ denotes the position of the origin_.    we equip @xmath5 with the discrete topology and @xmath20 with the product topology . by the tychonoff theorem , @xmath10 is then compact .",
    "in fact , it is homeomorphic to the cantor set .",

    "_ @xmath23",
    "if there exists a natural number @xmath24 with @xmath25 for all @xmath26 then @xmath21 is called _ periodic _ otherwise it is called _ non - periodic_.    whenever @xmath1 is a word over @xmath5 ( finite or infinite , indexed by @xmath13 or by @xmath11 ) we define @xmath27 by convention , the set of finite subwords includes the empty word .",
    "every subshift @xmath28 comes naturally with the set @xmath29 of associated finite words given by    @xmath30 a word @xmath31 is said to _ occur with bounded gaps _ if there exists an @xmath32 such that every @xmath33 with @xmath34 contains a copy of @xmath35 .",
    "as is well known ( and not hard to see ) @xmath28 is minimal if and only if every @xmath36 occurs with bounded gaps . for proofs and further discussion",
    "we refer to standard textbooks such as @xcite . we will be concerned here with the following strengthening of the bounded gaps condition .",
    "it concerns the case that @xmath37 can be chosen as @xmath38 with fixed @xmath39 ( independent of @xmath35 ) .",
    "a subshift @xmath21 is called _ linearly repetitive _ ( lr ) , if there exists a constant @xmath40 such that any word @xmath41 occurs in any word @xmath42 of length at least @xmath38 .",
    "this notion has been discussed under various names by various people . in particular",
    "it was studied by durand , host and skau @xcite in the setting of subshifts ( under the name linearly recurrent ) . for delone dynamical systems",
    "it was brought forward at about the same time by lagarias and pleasants @xcite under the name linearly repetitive. it has also featured in the work of boris solomyak @xcite ( under the name uniformly repetitive ) .",
    "it was also already discussed in an unpublished work of boshernitzan in the 90s .",
    "that work also contains a characterization in terms of positivity of weights .",
    "a corresponding result for delone systems was recently given in @xcite .",
    "durand @xcite gives a characterization of such subshifts in terms of primitive @xmath43-adic systems and shows the following ( which was already known to boshernitzan ) .",
    "[ theorem - unique - ergodicity ] let @xmath21 be a linearly repetitive subshift .",
    "then , the subshift is uniquely ergodic .",
    "in fact , linear repetitivity implies a strong form of subadditive ergodic theorem @xcite .",
    "validity of such a result together with the fundamental work of kotani @xcite is at the core of the approach to cantor spectrum of lebesgue measure zero developed in @xcite .",
    "our considerations on cantor spectrum rely on an extension of that approach worked out in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present ( parts of ) the spectral theory of discrete schrdinger operators associated to minimal dynamical systems .",
    "schrdinger operators occupy a prominent position in the theory of aperiodic order .",
    "indeed , they arise in the quantum mechanical description of conductance properties of quasicrystals and exhibit quite interesting mathematical properties . in fact",
    ", already the first two papers on them written by physicists suggest that the corresponding spectral measures are purely singular continuous and the spectrum is a cantor set of lebesgue measure zero @xcite . by now these features as well as other conductance - related properties known as anomalous transport",
    "have been thoroughly studied in a variety of models by various authors , see the survey articles @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon that the underlying spectrum is a cantor set of lebesgue measure zero is usually referred to as _ cantor spectrum of lebesgue measure zero _ and this is how we will refer to it subsequently .",
    "the laplacians on schreier graphs discussed later will turn out to be unitarily equivalent to certain such schrdinger operators .",
    "subsequently , we first discuss basic mathematical features of schrdinger operators associated to dynamical systems in the next section [ basic - schroedinger ] , then turn to absolutely continuous spectrum and the spectrum as a set for subshifts in section [ spectrum - set - ac ] and finally give some background from physics in section [ aperiodic - order - schroedinger ] .",
    "in this section we review some basic theory of discrete schrdinger operators ( or rather jacobi matrices ) associated to minimal topological dynamical systems .",
    "this framework is slightly more general than the framework of minimal subshifts .",
    "the results we discuss include constancy of the spectrum and uniform convergence of the so - called integrated density of states .",
    "all these results are well known .    whenever @xmath44 is a homeomorphism of the compact space @xmath22 we will refer to @xmath21 as a _ topological dynamical system_. later we will meet an even more general definition of dynamical system .",

    "some of our results can be seen as providing the two - sided counterparts to his investigations .",
    "the key ingredient in the investigations of @xcite is that the arising one - sided sequences can be considered as toeplitz sequences .",

    ", we will present a different approach based the @xmath146-decomposition and @xmath146-partition introduced in @xcite .",
    "the subshift @xmath142 will be of crucial importance for us as it will turn out that the schrdinger operators associated to it are unitarily equivalent to the laplacians on the schreier graphs of the grigorchuk s group @xmath147 .    while we do not use it in the sequel we would like to highlight that the substitution in question has already earlier appeared in the study of grigorchuk s group @xmath147 .",
    "indeed , it is ( a version of ) the substitution used by lysenok @xcite for getting a presentation of grigorchuk s group @xmath147 .",
    "more specifically , @xcite gives that @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the substitution on @xmath150 obtained from @xmath140 by replacing @xmath151 by @xmath152 , @xmath153 by @xmath154 and @xmath155 by @xmath156 .",

    "this implies that any word of @xmath141 occurs with bounded gaps ( as the word is a subword of @xmath163 and @xmath171 is a fixed point of @xmath173 ) .",
    "for this reason @xmath142 is minimal and @xmath176 holds for any @xmath177",

    "[ theorem - tau - linear - repetitive ] the subshift @xmath142 is linearly repetitive . in particular , @xmath142 is uniquely ergodic and minimal .",

    "theorem 1 of @xcite shows that linear repetitivity in fact holds for subshifts associated to any substitution provided minimality holds .",
    "unique ergodicity is then a direct consequence of linear repetitivity due to theorem [ theorem - unique - ergodicity ] .",

    "<S> there is a recently discovered connection between the spectral theory of schr - dinger operators whose potentials exhibit aperiodic order and that of laplacians associated with actions of groups on regular rooted trees , as grigorchuk s group of intermediate growth . </S>",
    "<S> we give an overview of corresponding results , such as different spectral types in the isotropic and anisotropic cases , including cantor spectrum of lebesgue measure zero and absence of eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we discuss the relevant background as well as the combinatorial and dynamical tools that allow one to establish the afore - mentioned connection . </S>",
    "<S> the main such tool is the subshift associated to a substitution over a finite alphabet that defines the group algebraically via a recursive presentation by generators and relators .    </S>",
