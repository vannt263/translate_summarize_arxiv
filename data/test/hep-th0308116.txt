    "within five - dimensional kaluza - klein theory , negative energy initial data configuration at a moment of time symmetry have been presented in the past @xcite . among the reasons for considering negative energy solutions",
    "is that naked singularities are associated to them . therefore studying such solutions is an attractive problem to further test the cosmic censorship conjecture  @xcite .",
    "additionally , as these bubbles can be obtained via semiclassical tunneling ( following witten s construction  @xcite ) , it is important to understand their dynamical behavior . to obtain a better feeling for the dynamics of the solutions presented in @xcite , which describe a bubble spacetime ,",
    "corley and jacobson @xcite analyzed the initial acceleration of the bubble ( which can be calculated analytically with the information contained on a single hypersurface . )",
    "they found that negative mass bubbles start out expanding and consequently argued a naked singularity would be unlikely .",
    "this conjecture is backed by the calculations at the initial hypersurface together with the intuition gained from a time symmetric scenario .",
    "namely , that if the bubble were to reverse its behavior it will go through another time - symmetric phase , which would also suggest the bubble should expand ( assuming the solution at this time of symmetry still belongs to the family presented in @xcite ) .",
    "recently however , a numerical study was presented  @xcite which computed explicitly the solution to the future of the initial , time - symmetric , initial data . in the negative mass case , the solution found appeared to indicate a very puzzling development .",
    "namely , that as the bubble expanded , it would encounter a naked singularity on its way .    in the present work we reexamine the dynamical behavior of the data presented in @xcite via numerical simulations , and",
    "further study a more general case where the initial data describes an initially collapsing bubble with negative mass .",
    "we restrict our simulations to the context of homogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes . to summarize our findings",
    ", we see that negative mass bubbles will not lead to a naked singularity . by choosing different members of the initial data family",
    ", these could start out either expanding or collapsing . in the former case",
    ", the bubble continues on expanding while in the latter case , the bubble bounces back without ever collapsing .",
    "we additionally study the case of a positive mass bubble which starts out collapsing . here , depending on the strength of the gauge field at the initial hypersurface , the bubble collapses to a black string or bounces back to expand `` forever '' ( i.e. for as long as we let the simulation run ) .",
    "furthermore , these two distinct possibilities give rise to critical behavior on the threshold of collapse or expansion .",
    "we consider a generalization of the time symmetric family of initial data presented in @xcite . we start with a spacetime endowed with the metric @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the standard metric on the unit two - sphere @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a smooth function that has a regular root at some @xmath4 ,",
    "is everywhere positive for @xmath5 and converges to one as @xmath6 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath7 parametrizes the extra dimension @xmath8 which has the period @xmath9 . the resulting spacetime @xmath10 constitutes a regular manifold with the topology @xmath11 .",
    "the bubble is located where the circumference of the extra dimension shrinks to zero , that is , at @xmath12 .",
    "additionally , we consider the presence of a * u(1 ) * gauge field in the following form , @xmath13 with @xmath14 an arbitrary constant and @xmath15 an integer greater than one .",
    "it is important to point out two things .",
    "first , the gauge field here considered has a more generic dependence than those previously considered in @xcite , where only the case @xmath16 was discussed .",
    "second , the symmetries of the problem would a priori allow for the gauge field to have non - trivial @xmath17 and @xmath18 components .",
    "however , it follows from maxwell s equations that those contributions would lead to a coulomb - like electric field which is divergent at the location of the bubble . for this reason we set those components of @xmath19 to zero .    in the time - symmetric case ,",
    "initial data satisfying the hamiltonian constraint obeys @xmath20 where @xmath21 . the parameter @xmath22 is related to the adm mass via @xmath23 .",
    "the fact that the bubble be located at @xmath12 requires that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we also require @xmath28 and avoid the conical singularity at @xmath12 by fixing the period of @xmath7 to @xmath9 . repeating the analysis in @xcite",
    "one finds that the initial acceleration of the bubble area is given by @xmath29 .",
    "\\label{eq : ddota}\\ ] ] for @xmath16 this agrees with the formula found by corley and jacobson , and as they discussed , for negative mass bubbles , the initial acceleration is positive , and only if chosen appropriately can a positive mass bubble have negative initial acceleration . as we will see later , in the vacuum case , this acceleration remains negative leading to a collapse of the bubble and the formation of a black string . in the non - vacuum case",
    "however , the strength of the gauge field can modify this behavior completely . for weak enough",
    "@xmath14 the bubble continues to collapse whereas when @xmath14 is large the bubble area bounces back and expands .",
    "furthermore , by fine - tuning the parameter @xmath14 we will show that the solution approaches a static bubble solution to the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we also consider non - vacuum initial data with @xmath30 which allow for richer scenarios .",
    "a particularly interesting case is that describing an initially negative acceleration with negative mass .",
    "if this were possible , and the bubble continued to collapse , this would likely give rise to a naked singularity .",
    "thus , we are interested in data for which @xmath31 . in view of the inequality ( [ eq : reghor ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddota ] ) this means that @xmath32 from this we see that for @xmath33 the mass can only be positive .",
    "in contrast to this , for @xmath30 and @xmath34 large enough such that @xmath35 , negative mass bubbles can be considered .",
    "a detailed description of the numerical techniques used in our code will be presented elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we point out its salient features .    1 .",
    "the equations are written in first oder symmetric hyperbolic form , with a gauge choice that is such that the characteristic speeds are given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "these properties facilitate achieving a stable implementation of the equations .",
    "regularity conditions are enforced at the bubble and employed to design a numerical scheme that satisfies a discrete energy estimate @xcite .",
    "this discrete energy estimate guarantees numerical stability for a related toy model problem .",
    "constraint preserving boundary conditions are enforced at the outer boundary to ensure no constraint violating modes are fed through it  @xcite .",
    "the equations are implemented using second order accurate finite difference techniques .",
    "a non - uniform radial coordinate is employed to improve the resolution near the bubble . for all cases presented here , the radial grid covered @xmath39 $ ] with a total of @xmath40 points .",
    "the outer boundary s location is chosen so as to have _ always _ less than a crossing time in our evolutions , guaranteeing outer boundary conditions ( though consistent with the constraints ) will not affect quantities at the bubble .",
    "second order convergence is checked in all runs . as an example , the convergence of some of the simulations representing expanding bubbles is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv1 ] .",
    "similar behavior is observed in all cases .",
    "here we evolve the brill - horowitz initial data in the case of vanishing gauge field .",
    "the bubble area @xmath42 as a function of the proper time @xmath43 at the bubble is shown in fig . [ fig : area ] for different values of the mass parameter @xmath22 .",
    "( figure [ fig : conv1 ] illustrates the convergence of the solution throughout the evolution ) .",
    "as expected , the lower the mass of the initial configuration , the faster the expansion . empirically , and for the parameter ranges used in our runs , we found that at late times the expansion rate is given by @xmath44 where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to proper time @xmath43 .",
    "in particular this approximation is valid for the bubble solution exhibited by witten @xcite which describes the time evolution in the case @xmath45 .",
    "we monitored several curvature invariant quantities ( the kretschmann invariant in particular ) for our numerical spacetimes and found no sign of divergence .",
    "next , we analyze the brill - horowitz initial data for the case in which the bubble is initially collapsing ( notice that for @xmath16 this implies that the adm mass is positive ) .",
    "while our numerical simulations reveal that in the absence of the gauge field such a bubble continues to collapse , we also show that when the gauge field is strong enough , the bubble shrinks at a rate which decreases with time and then bounces back .",
    "obviously , if the collapse trend were not halted , a singularity should form at the origin .",
    "since the adm mass is positive , one expects this singularity to be hidden behind an event horizon , and one should obtain a black string .",
    "in fact , for the solutions which are initially collapsing and which have vanishing gauge field , we observe the formation of an apparent horizon .",
    "furthermore , we compute the curvature invariant quantity @xmath46 at the apparent horizon ( as discussed in @xcite ) , where @xmath47 is the kretschmann invariant and @xmath48 the areal radius of the horizon . for a neutral black string ,",
    "this invariant is @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ fig : blackstring ] shows how this value is attained after the apparent horizon forms for representative vacuum cases ( with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , thus providing strong evidence for the formation of a black string .",
    "( we also find apparent horizons forming , or already present in the initial data , when a nontrivial gauge field is considered and the parameters are appropriately chosen .",
    "the corresponding bubbles will likely collapse to charged black strings and will be analyzed elsewhere  @xcite . ) +   +    as mentioned , for strong enough gauge fields , the previously described dynamics is severely affected . figure [ fig : criticalonset ] shows the bubble area vs. proper time for different values of @xmath14 . for large values of @xmath14",
    "the bubble `` bounces '' back and expands while for small ones the bubble collapses .",
    "there is a natural transition region separating these two possibilities . tuning the value of @xmath14 one",
    "can reveal an associated critical phenomena , the ` critical solution ' being a member of the family of static solutions given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these solutions can be obtained by a double analytic expansion of the black hole solutions described by eqs .",
    "( 2.13 ) and ( 2.15 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite followed by the transformations @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 are related to the period of the @xmath7 coordinate and to the adm mass via @xmath61 and @xmath62 . since these parameters are conserved throughout evolution , the initial data fixes the member of the static family the dynamical solution approaches to .",
    "details of the critical behavior exhibited by this system will be presented in  @xcite .",
    "+   +      we here restrict to cases with negative masses that start out collapsing .",
    "interestingly enough we find that even when starting with large initial negative accelerations , which in turn make the bubble shrink in size to very tiny values , it bounces back without ever collapsing into a naked singularity .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : notnakediii ] shows the bubble s area versus time for different values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "the initially collapsing bubbles decrease in size in a noticeable way but this trend is halted and the bubbles bounce back and expand . although we have not found a simple law as that in eq .",
    "( [ simplerelation ] ) , clearly the bubbles expand exponentially fast",
    ". therefore , it seems not to be possible to `` destroy '' the bubble and create a naked singularity .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar to the scenarios where one tries to `` destroy '' an extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole by attempting to drop into it a test particle with high charge to mass ratio .",
    "there , the electrostatic repulsion prevents the particle from entering the hole @xcite .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of spherically symmetric , homogeneous bubble spacetimes . these have revealed several interesting features .    in the vacuum case , negative mass bubbles do not form singularities , rather they continue on expanding and the asymptotic rate of expansion obeys the simple relation ( [ simplerelation ] ) .",
    "positive mass cases , as pointed out previously can start out either expanding or contracting . in the former case , they continue on expanding and its asymptotic rate obeys the same simple relation . for the collapsing case we have evidences that the bubble will collapse to a black string .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the ratio of a circle at infinity over the adm mass is given by @xmath63 since @xmath64 this value is always larger than that needed for the gregory - laflamme `` instability''@xcite .",
    "thus , a slight @xmath7-dependent perturbation of the scenario considered here could indeed give rise to a naked singularity .",
    "this would require infinite time to appear as shown in @xcite , but certainly would give rise to rich dynamics as illustrated in @xcite .    in the non - vacuum case ,",
    "the presence of a gauge field gives rise to additional features .",
    "first , for the positive mass case , it can `` halt '' the collapse and subsequently induce an expansion .",
    "furthermore , by fine - tuning the strength of the field , the solution approaches a static bubble .",
    "this critical solution separates the collapsing bubbles ( which , likely , collapse to a charged black string ) from the one that expand at late times . in a subsequent paper  @xcite we will show that the dynamical behavior near the static bubble exhibits critical phenomena . note that clearly the solution does encounter another moment of time symmetry at the critical value .",
    "however , for field strengths larger than the critical one , this is not the case .",
    "the bubble bounces but the solution does not go through a time - symmetric phase .",
    "last , the gauge field can also make _ negative _ mass bubbles start out collapsing if its radial dependence is steeper than that originally considered in @xcite .",
    "intuitively this happens due to the contribution of the energy in the gauge field overcoming the repulsive gravitational effect of the negative mass bubble .",
    "however , as part of the field is radiated away , the collapse is halted and a subsequent expansion results . by choosing both the strength of the field or its radial dependence appropriately ( with @xmath65 )",
    ", we could make the bubble start out collapsing at a very rapid rate . in these cases",
    ", the bubble shrinks to very small sizes but eventually bounces back without forming a naked singularity .",
    "we thank robert myers for calling this problem to our attention and for pointing out the influence a steeper radial dependence in the gauge field could have .",
