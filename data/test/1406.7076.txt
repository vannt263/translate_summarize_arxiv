    "laponite is a synthetic hectorite clay whose aqueous suspensions have often been used in the study of the glass transition phenomenon .",
    "a single laponite platelet has a thickness of 1 nm and a diameter of 25 - 30 nm @xcite .",
    "because of the highly anisotropic shape and the large negative charges on the flat surfaces , laponite clays in aqueous suspensions can exhibit a spontaneous ergodicity - breaking phase transition from free - flowing liquids to non - equilibrium , kinetically arrested states such as gels and glasses at low concentrations ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . due to the non - equilibrium nature of these arrested states , they exhibit aging , with the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of these suspensions evolving as the waiting time ( measured after the time of preparation ) increases .",
    "aging in these systems occurs by the spatially and temporally correlated local rearrangements of particles that can overcome local energy barriers , with the system exploring progressively deeper energy wells in phase space @xcite . the different arrested phases exhibit viscoelastic properties under different applied stress - strain conditions . on application of stresses above a yield value ,",
    "the elastic and viscous moduli of these soft solids decrease and the suspensions eventually flow like a fluid .",
    "once the applied stress is removed , the suspension gradually recovers its jammed state @xcite . besides their obvious importance in fundamental research , aqueous suspensions of laponite",
    "also find wide applications in the petroleum , cosmetics , pharmaceutical , coating , and food industries @xcite .",
    "+ it is believed that a major factor contributing to the time - dependent behavior of aqueous suspensions is the swelling and subsequent breakup of large laponite clusters into smaller entities @xcite . due to the importance of laponite suspensions in various technological processes and their frequent use as model glass - formers , the dispersion kinetics of laponite clay under different experimental conditions needs to be studied . in most of the studies undertaken previously , clusters of clay particles were assumed to exfoliate into individual platelets when dispersed in water .",
    "however , several studies also show that clay particles can exist as rigid aggregates , known as tactoids , that consist of more than one platelet oriented parallely .",
    "many experimental methods e.g. atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , cryogenic scanning electron microscopy ( cryo - sem ) , small angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) , small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) , dynamic light scattering ( dls ) and transient electrically - induced birefringence ( teb ) have been employed to characterize the tactoid sizes of clays in aqueous suspensions at different concentrations and under varying experimental conditions @xcite . however , a systematic study of the particle size distribution ( psd ) in aqueous clay suspensions and its dependence on clay volume fraction and suspension age is still lacking . indeed , dls has been used intensively for particle sizing , but its application is limited to very dilute suspensions where the single scattering mechanism and the stokes - einstein relation are valid .",
    "several dls studies show sol - glass transition with increase in concentration and age of the clay suspensions @xcite .",
    "intensity auto - correlation data obtained in a dls experiments is typically analyzed in terms of a fast ( @xmath2 ) and a slow relaxation time ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is very difficult to acquire psd information from @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the glassy phase as the stokes - einstein relation is invalid in the soft glasses .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to investigate the dispersion of laponite clay in aqueous suspensions of different ages using ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy ( uas ) .",
    "the uas techniques offer a unique possibility of estimating psds for soft solid systems and can be used to analyze non - transparent and even highly structured systems . at the same time",
    ", it is a non - destructive technique that uses very low intensity ultrasound .",
    "the measurement does not , therefore , affect the sample micro - structures and yields an accurate estimate of average particle sizes and psds . over the last two decades",
    ", this technique has been applied in different particulate systems of quartz , rutile , latex , alumina particles and also in emulsions @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we measure ultrasound attenuation spectra to estimate psds of clay tactoids in laponite suspensions in a concentrations range ( @xmath4 w / v ) where the suspensions spontaneously show liquid to soft solid transitions with increasing age .",
    "furthermore , afm data has been acquired to confirm the average platelet sizes of both laponite and na - montmorillonite particles in aqueous suspension .",
    "we show here that the dispersion kinetics of both clay suspensions follow the same approximate trends .",
    "two different smectite clays : laponite and na - montmorillonite are investigated in this study .",
    "both the clays are from phyllosilicate group with @xmath5 structure , in which a octahedral metal sub - layer is sandwiched between two tetrahedral silica sub - layers .",
    "the three sub - layers together form a single unit crystal layer which grows in lateral direction to form a platelet or sheet structure .",
    "some of the metal ions ( magnesium in laponite and aluminium in na - montmorillonite ) in the octahedral sub - layer get replaced isomorphically by lower valency ions ( lithium and magnesium respectively for the two clays ) .",
    "this results in negative charges on the outer surface without any structural change .",
    "the rim of the platelet gains positive charges due to the protonation of oh@xmath6 group below a suspension ph of 10 . in dry powder form ,",
    "the van der waals interactions between unit layers lead to the stacking of platelets with intercalated sodium counterions .",
    "these stacks of clay platelets are known as tactoids .",
    "laponite is a highly pure variety of synthetic clay with a very reproducible chemical composition . according to the manufacturer ,",

    "depending on the nature and concentration of the colloidal particles under study , it may be possible to separate the different loss mechanisms in the ultrasound frequency domain . in the frequency range of @xmath24 mhz ,",
    "the viscous loss mechanism dominates as the aqueous suspensions used here are characterized by high particle density contrasts and rigidities . as the frequency changes from 1 mhz to 100 mhz , the wavelength of ultrasound in water changes from 1 mm to 15 @xmath25 m .",
    "scattering loss is negligible as the wavelength range of ultrasound is much larger than the expected sizes of the particles .",
    "the expression for the complex wave number @xmath13 , derived in @xcite on the basis of coupled phase model @xcite by assuming predominantly viscous loss in the long wavelength limit ( @xmath26 ) can be written as : + @xmath27    where , @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the stress modulus , @xmath32 is the density of the particle , @xmath33 is the density of the medium , @xmath34 is the density of the suspension , @xmath35 is the volume fraction of the @xmath36th species of the particulate phase , @xmath37 is the total volume fraction of the particulate phase , @xmath38 is diameter of a particle of the @xmath36th species , @xmath39 is the shear viscosity of the medium and @xmath40 is the drag coefficient of a particle of size @xmath38 .",

    "the psds are extracted by modeling the data using bimodal distributions .",
    "the number of platelets per tactoid is estimated using an esd formula proposed in @xcite .",
    "our analysis confirms the presence of tactoids that consist of more than one platelet in laponite suspensions of concentrations between 1.5% and 4% w / v .",
    "the viscous attenuation for concentrations below 1.5% w / v is very small and becomes comparable to the noise of measurement of the intrinsic attenuation .",
    "this results in difficulty in data analysis .",
    "some earlier studies using saxs , dls , and afm have demonstrated the presence of tactoids comprising more than one platelet in aqueous laponite suspensions of concentrations less than 1.5% w / v @xcite .",
    "a transient electrically induced birefringence ( teb ) study on laponite rd suspensions has also indicated an increase in the average tactoid size with volume fraction of clay particles in the concentration range @xmath92 w / v @xcite . however , at very low concentration ( 0.025% w / v was studied in @xcite ) , aggregates are found to quickly disperse into individual discs .",
    "the data from these previous studies , along with the results obtained from the ultrasound spectroscopy experiments reported here , indicate that the tactoid size distributions in aqueous suspensions of clay depend on the concentration of clay particles .",
    "the time evolution of psds in a 3% w / v laponite suspension indicates that the polydispersity of tactoid sizes decreases substantially with age .",
    "the same behavior can also be observed in a 3% w / v aqueous suspension of na - montmorillonite ( figure s7 of supporting information ) .",
    "the age evolution of the ultrasound attenuation coefficient @xmath11 ( and hence the psds ) for different clay concentrations indicates a major role of electrostatic interactions in the tactoid exfoliation process . during the aggregate dispersion process ,",
    "when the inter - tactoid repulsions becomes comparable to the intra - tactoid repulsions , further exfoliation of the tactoids into smaller entities becomes very slow .",
    "we believe that this is the main reason behind the incomplete disintegration of clay clusters in the concentration range studied here .",
    "our study therefore justifies our claim that uas is a useful technique to elucidate the psds of colloidal suspensions whose concentrations lies in a range where other techniques , like dls or afm , often fail .",
    "afm images of laponite tactoids and the estimation of the sizes and the thicknesses of the tactoids are shown in figures s1 and s2 . a plot verifying beer - lambert law ( figure s3 ) , supplied values of different constants used in equation 3 , the method of graphical solutions ( figure s4 ) , afm image analyses of na - montmorillonite tactoids ( figures s5 and s6 ) and a plot for age evolution of aggregate - sizes of na - montmorillonite in aqueous suspension ( figure s7 ) are provided .",
