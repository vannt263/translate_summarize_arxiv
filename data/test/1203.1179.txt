    "in the last two decades , we have witnessed dramatic advances in complex networks research , which has been one of the most active topics in statistical physics and closely related disciplines @xcite .",
    "the central issue in this field is to study how the network topology influences the dynamics @xcite .",
    "as one of the typical dynamical processes built on complex networks , epidemic spreading has attracted more and more significant attention @xcite . despite much effort , many aspects of its role in the case of metapopulation models are still unclear and deserve more investigation .    very recently , metapopulation dynamics on heteregeneous networks , which incorporate mobility over the nodes , local interaction at the nodes , and a complex network structure , has gained great research attention @xcite . in this",
    "context , reaction - diffusion ( rd ) processes have been widely used to model phenomena as diverse as epidemic and computer viruses spreading @xcite , biological pattern formation @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , population evolution @xcite , and many other spatially distributed systems @xcite . in a series of important papers ,",
    "et al_. @xcite provided an analysis of the basic rd process of the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( @xmath5 ) model defined on heterogeneous metapopulation networks .",
    "therein , each network node represents an urban area together with its population and edges represent air travel fluxes along which individuals diffuse , coupling the epidemic spreading in different urban areas .",
    "they paid particular attention to the epidemic threshold @xmath6 , and found that @xmath6 is strongly affected by the topological fluctuations of the network for diffusing susceptible individuals .",
    "later , balcan and vespignani @xcite extended such analysis to non - markovian diffusive processes on complex networks , wherein individuals have a memory of their location of origin and displaced individuals return to their original subpopulation with a certain rate .",
    "very recently , vespignani @xcite reviewed and highlighted some of the recent progress in modelling dynamical processes that integrates the complex features and heterogeneities of real - world systems .",
    "nevertheless , all the studies so far have treated the curing rate @xmath7 as a homogenous parameter , i.e. , it is not dependent on the local property of the network node , such as the degree @xmath1 .",
    "note , however , in reality the curing rate of individuals should certainly be associated with the available medical resources in the local subpopulation , i.e. , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath7 is a function of the degree @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask : how would the metapopulation dynamics of the @xmath5 model , for instance , the epidemic threshold @xmath6 , depend on such a @xmath1-dependent curing strategy ?",
    "the answer to this question may provide useful instructions regarding the control of epidemic explosion in metapopulation networks .    in the present paper ,",
    "we have addressed such a question by considering a simple strategy , @xmath8 , where @xmath1 denotes the node degree and @xmath2 is an adjustable parameter . if @xmath9 , one recovers the usual cases studied in previous works .",
    "herein , we mainly focus on the influence of varying @xmath2 on @xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , we found that @xmath6 bypasses a clear - cut maximum at a certain @xmath4 , which corresponds to an optimal strategy to suppress epidemic explosion .",
    "this observation along with the value of @xmath4 is robust to the change of the network size and the average network degree . to place the finding on a solid foundation",
    ", we have also performed a mean field ( mf ) analysis , wherein @xmath6 is identified as the onset point where the global healthy state with no infected individuals loses stability .",
    "the mf equations successfully reproduce the @xmath10 dependences , and also provide more insights regarding the routes to epidemic explosion for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath11 distinct subpopulations , each corresponding to a network node .",
    "individuals inside each node run stochastically through the paradigmatic @xmath5 model @xcite .",
    "schematically , the stochastic infection dynamics is given by : @xmath12 the first reaction reflects the fact that each susceptible individual becomes infected upon encountering one or more infected individuals at a probability rate @xmath13 .",
    "the second indicates that infected individuals are cured and become again susceptible at a @xmath1-dependent rate @xmath14 . inside each network",
    "node , reaction processes take place under the assumption of a homogenous mixing and conserving the total number of individuals . after the reaction , individuals randomly diffuse along the edges departing from its local node .    in this model , a significant and general result is that the system undergoes an absorbing - state phase transition with density @xmath15 increasing , in analogy with critical phenomena @xcite . here",
    "@xmath15 is defined as the total number of individuals divided by the number @xmath11 of network nodes .",
    "the critical density @xmath6 indicates the epidemic threshold , what we are interested in .    to begin",
    ", we perform our strategy on scale - free ( sf ) networks by using the barabsi  albert ( ba ) model @xcite with power - law degree distribution @xmath16 .",
    "scale - free networks are much more heterogeneous and serve as better candidates to test our strategy than other homogeneous networks , such as small - world or random networks . for a node @xmath17 with degree @xmath18 ,",
    "the curing rate is given by @xmath19 herein , @xmath20 is normalized such that the average curing rate remains constant : @xmath21 .",
    "note that in other related works about epidemic dynamics on networks , a @xmath1-dependent strategy , but associated with the infection rate , had also been considered@xcite .",
    "the system evolves in time according to the following rules @xcite .",
    "the dynamics proceeds in parallel and considers a discrete time step representing the fixed time scale @xmath22 of the process .",
    "the reaction and diffusion rates are therefore converted into probabilities . at each time step , the system is updated as follows .",
    "inside each network node with degree @xmath1 , each infected individual is cured and becomes an susceptible one with probability @xmath23 . at the same time , each susceptible individual acquires infection from any infected one with probability @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total number of infected individuals in the node . after all nodes have been updated for the reactions , diffusion processes take place by allowing each individual to move into a randomly chosen neighboring node with probability @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for infected and susceptible individuals respectively , where @xmath28 denotes the corresponding diffusion constant . in our simulation ,",
    "the parameters are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 if not otherwise specified .",
    "each plot is obtained via averaging over 20 independent simulation runs .",
    "fig.[figphasetransion](a ) shows how the proportion @xmath33 of infected individuals in the whole network increases with @xmath15 , where @xmath34 denotes the density of infected individuals in the whole network , for four different values of @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , the system undergos a phase transition at a certain threshold density @xmath6 , above which @xmath33 monotonically increases from zero . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the system stays in a healthy state with @xmath36 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath6 reaches a largest value for @xmath2 = 1.3 , compared to those for @xmath2 = 0 , 1.0 , 2.0 .",
    "this is demonstrated more clearly in fig.[figphasetransion ] ( b ) , where @xmath6 are plotted as a function of @xmath2 for different network sizes @xmath11 .",
    "the distinct peak locates at @xmath37 , which is rather robust to the change of network size @xmath11 as shown in the inset .",
    "in addition , we have also investigated how this phenomenon depends on the average network degree @xmath38 . as shown in fig.[figphasetransion ] ( c ) , the optimal value @xmath4 also remains nearly constant with varying @xmath38 from 4 to 14 .",
    "so far we have considered that all species diffuse with the same rate . in the following",
    ", we will take into account different diffusion rates for different species .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that infected individuals diffuse with a fixed rate @xmath39 and vary the diffusion rate of susceptible individuals @xmath40 .",
    "the epidemic threshold @xmath6 as a function of @xmath2 is plotted in fig.2 for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , the bell - shape dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath2 always exists for nonzero @xmath40 , with the peak located at nearly the same optimal value @xmath43 .",
    "the height of this peak decreases with @xmath40 , and eventually @xmath6 is independent of @xmath2 for @xmath44 .",
    "3(a ) shows that @xmath6 as a function of @xmath2 for different infection rates @xmath13 .",
    "it can be found that the values of @xmath13 do not influence the qualitative dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath2 , i.e. , a maximum @xmath6 still shows up for the same optimal @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath4 do change with @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , we have also considered how the above findings depend on the network topology . to this end , we have performed simulations on sf networks with different exponents @xmath45 and erds - rnyi ( er ) random networks .",
    "@xmath6 as a function of @xmath2 for different type of networks are shown in fig.3(b ) .",
    "it is found that there still exists an optimal value of @xmath2 , leading to the maximal threshold .",
    "for sf networks , the optimal value of @xmath2 is always close to @xmath46 , while for er networks , the @xmath10 curve becomes not so sharp indicating that @xmath6 is not sensitive to the change of @xmath2 .",
    "according to the stochastic simulation scheme , one may write down the following set of dynamic equations at a mf level ,    [ eqratemodel ] @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the average densities of infected and susceptible individuals , respectively , in the nodes with degree @xmath1 . the first term in the right hand side of eq.(3a ) accounts for the change of infected individuals due to the reaction ( infection and recovery ) processes , and the second term accounts for the diffusion of infected individuals into and out of those nodes with degree @xmath1 .",
    "eq.(3b ) can be interpreted in a similar manner .",
    "@xmath50 represents the conditional probability that a node of degree @xmath1 is connected to a node of degree @xmath51 , which equals to @xmath52 @xcite for ba networks .",
    "one notes that a thorough analysis of eqs.(3 ) is not easy . for sake of simplicity , here we only consider the case @xmath53 .",
    "then , substituting this into eqs.([eqratemodel ] ) and using @xmath54 , one obtains    [ eqrate ] @xmath55    for @xmath9 and thus @xmath56 , it is already shown that @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "but for @xmath58 , it is hard to get the explicit expression of @xmath6 from eqs.([eqrate ] ) directly .",
    "clearly , eqs.([eqrate ] ) admit a steady state , which solves @xmath59 , @xmath60 which physically corresponds to the disease - free state .",
    "intuitively , this healthy state will lose stability at the critical density @xmath6 , above which the steady state value of @xmath61 can not be 0 any more .",
    "therefore , one can alternatively perform linear stability analysis of @xmath62 to get @xmath6 .",
    "following standard procedures , one can readily obtain the jacobian matrix and calculate the eigenvalues @xmath63 .",
    "the healthy state will lose stability when @xmath64 , the largest value of the real part of the eigenvalues , passes through zero from below .",
    "note that explicit expression for @xmath64 is not available , but numerical calculation of it is easy .",
    "[ figeigenvalue ] ( a ) plots @xmath64 as a function of @xmath15 for several values of @xmath2 . the value of @xmath15 where the @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath6 .",
    "as expected , @xmath6 is the largest for @xmath66 compared to those for other @xmath2 .",
    "[ figeigenvalue ] ( b ) presents @xmath6 as a function of @xmath2 obtained from simulations ( symbols ) and mf analysis ( solid line ) .",
    "apparently , the mf results are in rather good agreements with the simulation ones in fig.1 .",
    "to get more insights into how the epidemic explosion takes place for different @xmath2 , we turn to the eigenvector @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath64 at the onset of the phase transition , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the element @xmath69 of this vector measures the relative amplitude of the fluctuation away from @xmath70 for nodes with given degree @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath1 qualitatively tells us how the epidemic explosion grows from the healthy state . in fig .",
    "[ figeigenvector ] , we depict the eigenvectors @xmath71 as a function of @xmath1 for different @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , it can be observed that epidemic explosion starts from large - degree nodes for @xmath2 less than @xmath4 , as shown by the dotted , dashed and dash dotted lines in fig.[figeigenvector ] , while it is from small - degree nodes for @xmath2 larger than @xmath4 , as shown by solid and short dash dotted lines . for @xmath72 ,",
    "@xmath69 is not that sensitive on @xmath1 , indicating a relatively homogenous epidemic explosion .    to reveal the underlying mechanism of the epidemic spreading for different @xmath2 in more detail ,",
    "we illustrate the time evolution of @xmath73 , the average density of infected individuals in the nodes with degree @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for two particular values of @xmath2 , one ( @xmath74 ) less than @xmath4 and the other ( @xmath75 ) larger than it .",
    "this can give us more detailed information about how the epidemic outbreak takes place on nodes with different degree @xmath1 .",
    "we find that , for @xmath74 , the disease starts to spread from large - degree nodes , such as @xmath1=88 , 75 and 60 , as shown by the top three lines in fig .",
    "6(a ) ; while for @xmath75 , the spreading starts from those nodes with relatively small degree , such as @xmath1=12 , 17 and 8 , as shown in fig .",
    "these phenomena indicate that there indeed exist two different epidemic explosion routes for @xmath2 being less or larger than @xmath4 , which are consistent with the analysis associated with the eigenvectors as shown in fig.5 .",
    "the above different pathways regarding small or large @xmath2 may be illustrated qualitatively in the following way .",
    "consider the individuals in a given node are infected at the beginning .",
    "these patients will diffuse to neighboring nodes through the links .",
    "certainly , nodes with larger degrees will have more chances to accept these patients . to efficiently suppress the epidemic explosion",
    ", the curing rates in such large - degree nodes should be relatively large to compensate these incoming patients via diffusion .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that @xmath14 should be an increasing function of @xmath1 to maintain an effective epidemic control .",
    "intuitively , one may imagine that the most efficient way is to keep linear dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath76 in our strategy , considering that every incoming patient via diffusion can be cured on time .",
    "however , this is not exactly the case because the reactions inside a node involve nonlinear autocatalytic processes , which makes @xmath4 larger than 1 ( unfortunately , why @xmath4 is so robust to be about 1.3 is still open to us ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is too large , which means that the medical resources are biased to large - degree nodes , the patients in small - degree nodes can not be cured on time . in this case",
    ", disease will start to spread from those small - degree nodes . in the contrast case ,",
    "the disease will start more abruptly from those large - degree nodes since the curing rates there are too smaller than required .",
    "these scenario are in agreement with the picture shown in fig .",
    "[ figeigenvector ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "one should note that the @xmath2 value can not be arbitrary for the real world , if we accept the power - law dependence .",
    "following the recipe of eq.2 , for a scale free network with minimum , mean and maximum degree respectively of 2 , 5 and 100 , the recovery rate will range from 0.4 to 20 in the simplest case of linear dependency ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "this large difference is to some extent not reasonable , which implies that the optimal control with @xmath66 is hard to be realized practically . nevertheless , as a model study",
    ", we can just change @xmath2 as we want to see what we can find .",
    "if , for instance , we tune @xmath2 to a reasonable non - zero value , say @xmath74 , the ratio of the maximal and minimal @xmath7 would be about 10 for a network with @xmath1 ranging from 1 to 100 , which can also lead to a much better epidemic control ( @xmath77 ) than previous case of @xmath9 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "therefore , our work has indeed provided an efficient strategy to suppress the epidemic explosion .    in summary",
    ", we have studied a variant of @xmath5 model defined on scale - free metapopulation networks , wherein the curing rate in a node with degree @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath79 . by detailed numerical simulations ,",
    "we show that the epidemic threshold reaches a maximum value when @xmath2 is tuned to be @xmath3 , which corresponds to an optimal control strategy to suppress epidemic explosion and is robust to the change of network size or average degree .",
    "we have also performed a mean field analysis to further elucidate this strategy and unravel the distinct pathways to epidemic spreading for @xmath2 larger or less than @xmath4 .",
    "our findings suggest that a proper allocation of medical resources can best suppress the epidemic explosion , which could be of great importance in practical epidemic control .",
