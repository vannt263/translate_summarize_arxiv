    "the kinetic roughening of growing surfaces is a problem of fundamental interest in nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "the interest arises from theoretical , experimental , and numerical evidence of scale invariance and universality of the statistical fluctuations of rough interfaces in a large variety of systems @xcite .",
    "one candidate system is the roughening of a driven interface separating two fluids in a porous medium .",
    "this problem has important practical applications , and has time and length scales easily accessible in the laboratory .",
    "it allows different possible realizations , depending on the relative viscosities and wetting properties of the fluids involved @xcite .",
    "one of these possible realizations which has received considerable attention in recent years is _ imbibition _ , i.e. the situation in which a viscous wetting fluid ( typically oil or water ) displaces a second less  viscous , non  wetting fluid ( typically air ) which initially fills the porous medium .",
    "the motion of imbibition interfaces can be _ spontaneous _",
    ", i.e. driven solely by capillary forces , or _ forced _ externally at either constant applied pressure or constant injection rate .",
    "although there have been many experimental investigations of the scaling properties of imbibition interfaces in the last years , some results , particularly the quantitative values of scaling exponents , remain controversial . the current situation for the case of spontaneous imbibition",
    "is reviewed in ref .",
    "the situation for the case of forced imbibition is summarized in section [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "the limitations of the experiments , in our opinion , arise firstly from the lack of precise knowledge of the properties of the disorder introduced by the model porous medium , and secondly from the related difficulty in tuning the relative strength of stabilizing to destabilizing forces in the flow . in the present work we have attempted to avoid these two limitations by using a particular model porous medium , consisting on a hele  shaw cell with precisely designed and controlled random variations in gap spacing .    in our setup",
    ", an initially planar interface becomes statistically rough on a mesoscopic scale , as a result of the interplay between ( i ) the stabilizing effects of the viscous pressure field in the fluid , and the surface tension in the plane of the cell , on long and short length scales respectively , and ( ii ) the destabilizing effect of local fluctuations in capillary pressure , arising from the random fluctuations in gap spacing , on short length scales .",
    "although they have a different physical origin , the role of local fluctuations in capillary pressure , in our setup , is very similar to the role of wettability defects in the _ imperfect hele  shaw cell _ introduced by de gennes @xcite , and studied by paterson and coworkers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic experimental study of forced imbibition of our model porous medium , by a wetting silicone oil driven at constant flow rate .",
    "since the competing forces in our system are the same as in a real porous medium , the physics governing roughening is very similar in the two cases .",
    "the relative importance of viscous forces can be finely tuned by changing the injection rate of the invading fluid , and the strength of capillary fluctuations can be tuned by adjusting the distance between the two glass plates . the sequence of photographs in fig .",

    "to be specific , let us consider a two  dimensional system with cartesian coordinates @xmath10 , of lateral size @xmath11 in the @xmath12 direction and of infinite extension in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the interface is driven in the direction of positive @xmath13 , and its position at time @xmath14 is parametrized by the function @xmath15 .",

    "the notation @xmath21 represents an spatial average in the interval @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the system size .",
    "the standard picture of kinetic roughening is summarized in the dynamical scaling assumption of family and vicsek @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath3 is the _ roughening _ ( or static ) exponent and @xmath24 is the _ dynamic _ exponent .",
    "the scaling function @xmath25 is : @xmath26 this picture assumes that the lateral correlation length of the interface fluctuations increases in time as @xmath27 , in the @xmath12 direction . for all length scales @xmath18 within this correlation length",
    "the interface is rough , @xmath28 . as the lateral correlation length increases , the interfacial width increases correspondingly with time as @xmath29 , which defines a _ growth _ exponent @xmath30 . finally ,",
    "when the lateral correlation length exceeds the system size , @xmath11 , at a crossover time @xmath31 , the interface fluctuations saturate .",
    "one way of measuring @xmath3 is through the analysis of the interfacial width as a function of different system sizes @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath32 , at saturation . from an experimental point of view , however , it is not practical to perform experiments at different @xmath11 .",
    "usually it is prefered to measure @xmath3 by analyzing @xmath33 for different window sizes @xmath18 , with @xmath34 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath35 gives a _ local _ roughness exponent @xmath36 , which is usually identified with the _ global _ exponent @xmath3 .",
    "this kind of analysis must be performed with some caution , however , because it can only provide @xmath37 and hence fails for super  rough interfaces ( @xmath38 ) . moreover , a number of problems of kinetic roughening present intrinsic anomalous scaling , characterized by different values of local and global exponents @xcite .",
    "these difficulties can be overcome by analyzing the power spectrum of the interfacial fluctuations , defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 e^{iqx}.\\ ] ] the notation @xmath41 indicates average over disorder configurations .",

    "vicsek scaling assumption for the power spectrum reads @xcite : @xmath46 where the scaling function is given by @xmath47 the power spectrum can give values @xmath38 and hence is applicable to super  rough interfaces . on the other hand , the presence of intrinsic anomalous scaling can be detected by a systematic shift of the power spectra computed at successive time intervals @xcite .",
    "the scaling concept has allowed a classification of kinetic roughening problems in universality classes characterized by different families of scaling exponents . the first class is described by the thermal kardar  parisi ",
    "zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite , which provides a local description of interfacial roughening in the presence of an additive white noise .",
    "the kpz scaling exponents are @xmath48 and @xmath49 in two dimensions .",

    "wilkinson ( ew ) equation @xcite , which gives @xmath50 and @xmath51 in two dimensions .",
    "when , instead of being purely thermal , the noise in the kpz equation is supposed to depend on the interface height @xmath52 , the equation displays a depinning transition . at the pinning threshold",
    "the interface behaviour of the complete equation with the nonlinear term ( `` quenched kpz '' ) can be mapped to the directed percolation depinning ( dpd ) model , whose scaling exponents in two dimensions are @xmath53 . suppressing the nonlinearity yields",
    "the `` quenched ew '' equation , for which @xmath54 and @xmath55 in two dimensions @xcite .    in the case of imbibition , there are two important issues which make the above classification of limited applicability .",
    "the first one is the quenched nature of the disorder .",
    "it has been argued that for very large driving the disorder may still be considered as a fluctuating in time ( thermal ) noise , but in general the disorder must be treated as a static , quenched noise .",
    "the second issue is the nonlocal character of the dynamics , due to fluid transport in the cell @xcite .",
    "this issue has received important attention recently , with the introduction of imbibition models which take fluid transport explicitly into account , giving rise to nonlocal interfacial equations @xcite .",
    "the models presented in @xcite are consistent with the well known macroscopic equations of the problem ( darcy s law and interfacial boundary conditions ) .",
    "they differ in the way the noise is included in the equations and in the noise properties .",
    "the starting point of ganesan and brenner @xcite is a random field ising model .",
    "the permeability is taken spatially uniform and the noise exhibits long range spatial correlations . in the case of forced imbibition , and based on a flory ",
    "type scaling , the model predicts that the roughness exponent @xmath3 depends on the capillary number ca , with asymptotic values @xmath56 for the smallest drivings and @xmath51 for the largest drivings .",
    "the approaches of dub _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and hernndez  machado _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are both based in a conserved ginzburg - landau model , where the noise is introduced in a fluctuating chemical potential or in the mobility , respectively , without long range correlations .",
    "@xcite , however , consider only the case of spontaneous imbibition , which could give results very different from the case of forced imbibition , specially for the growth exponent @xmath57 . by numerical integration",
    "they obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite study the case of forced imbibition , and predict a different scaling of the short and long length scales , with exponents @xmath60 in the former regime , and @xmath61 in the latter .",
    "a common feature of these models , pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , is the presence of a new lateral length scale , @xmath62 , related to the interplay of interfacial tension and liquid conservation . for @xmath63",
    "the dominant stabilizing contribution is the interfacial tension in the plane of the cell , while for @xmath64 it is the fluid flow .",
    "the interplay leads to a dependence of @xmath6 ( @xmath65 ) on @xmath0 of the form @xmath66 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the experimental characterization of the scaling properties of interfaces in two  dimensional forced imbibition remains conflicting .",

    "moreover , the analysis of @xmath35 is insensitive to the linear correction of the interface ( except for values of @xmath18 comparable to the system size ) and gives results consistent with those obtained from @xmath42 only for interfaces with periodic boundary conditions .    since the maximum width of the meniscus is only one half the gap width ( in conditions of complete wetting ) the interface",
    "can be considered one  dimensional at the length scale of the copper islands .",
    "the resolution of the interface fluctuations in the @xmath13 direction is @xmath1041 pixel at a given point .",
    "nevertheless , the measurement of the global interfacial width @xmath33 is much more precise because the width is an average over the @xmath162 points of the interface .    given that , according to our choice of the time origin , the whole interface is already inside the disorder at @xmath89 , @xmath167 . for this reason ,",
    "we have decided to characterize the interface fluctuations by the _ subtracted width _",
    "@xmath168 , defined by @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "notice that , since the data analysis is based on power law dependencies , short times are very sensitive to the definition of @xmath89 and to the value @xmath170 . after analyzing the data for different definitions of @xmath89 , and checking the influence of subtracting @xmath170",
    ", we have found that the analysis based on the subtracted width is the most objective and less sensitive to the details of the experimental procedure .",
    "the error bars shown in the @xmath171 plots indicate the dispersion of the different individual experiments with respect to the average curve plus the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath89 .",
    "finally , the crossover time @xmath172 has been measured on the @xmath171 log - log plots as the time when the power law with slope @xmath57 crosses the horizontal straight line that corresponds to the average value of the interfacial width at saturation , @xmath173 .",
    "the parameters explored in our experiments are summarized in table[tab : exp - list ] . the minimum velocity selected in the experiments , @xmath174 mm / s ( which will be taken as reference unit for interfacial velocities ) , has been chosen to ensure that the interface is always single  valued for gap spacings @xmath175 mm .",
    "we have used three different disorder realizations for sq and sq - n and four for t. for each disorder realization and each set of experimental parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) we have carried out three runs for sq and sq - n , and two runs for t.    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : main - results ] shows the main results obtained for the roughness exponents @xmath4 ( short length scales ) and @xmath5 ( long length scales ) at different disorder configurations and drivings . for small ca ,",
    "capillary forces are dominant at all scales , and the dynamics is very sensitive to the disorder configuration . for sq and sq - n , the interfaces get locally pinned , and the measured exponents are close to those obtained in dpd or in experiments where capillary forces are dominant @xcite . in the limit of persistent disorder ,",
    "the nature of the disorder impedes pinning , but the effect of the destabilizing capillary forces combined with the correlations between neighboring tracks leads to a new regime that can be described using the anomalous scaling ansatz @xcite .",
    "this new regime also extends to the region of moderate ca for t disorder . for moderate ca , viscous forces",
    "are dominant at long length scales and two clear regimes separated by a crossover wavenumber @xmath6 can be characterized . for sq and sq",
    "- n we get roughness exponents @xmath176 and @xmath177 . for t",
    ", we get a qualitatively similar behaviour , but obtaining lower values of the exponents due to finite size effects at long length scales and the dominant capillary forces at short length scales . for large ca ,",
    "the viscous forces cause that the initial super  roughness at short times and short length scales gets frozen in , obtaining the same roughness exponent @xmath178 for all the disorder configurations .",
    "our experimental results can be compared now with the predictions of the nonlocal models @xcite discussed in section ii .",
    "it appears that none of the models can account for the different results obtained in the whole range of capillary numbers explored .",
    "although the flory  type argument used by ganesan and brenner @xcite is difficult to justify in this nonequilibrium situation , they obtain roughness exponents ( @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) consistent with our values for small and moderate ca. the exponents obtained by hernndez ",
    "@xcite for the long length scales at moderate ca , @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) , are in agreement with our experimental values in the long time regime , where the viscous forces are dominant .",
    "the value of @xmath3 for short length scales , corresponding to the short time regime of the model , gives a super  rough behaviour ( @xmath184 ) dominated by surface tension in the plane , but larger than the exponent measured in the experiment . for large capillary numbers the numerical result of dub _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xmath185 , is in agreement with our experimental results , but not the result @xmath186 because , as pointed out above , these authors assume a spontaneous imbibition . at this point",
    "it would be interesting to know whether a model containing a quenched disorder both in the mobility and in the chemical potential would be able to explain the experimental results for the whole regime of ca studied here , and specially the regime of large ca in forced imbibition .",
    "this remains an open question .",
    "our last analysis is the variation of @xmath6 with @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover wavenumber @xmath6 separates the regime in which the long length scale fluctuations ( small @xmath187 ) are damped by the viscous pressure field , from the regime in which the short length scale fluctuations ( large @xmath187 ) are damped by the interfacial tension in the plane of the cell . since the relative importance of the viscous pressure field increases with ca",
    ", it is expected that @xmath6 will increase with @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , a linear analysis of the interfacial problem shows that the viscous damping is proportional to @xmath188 and the interfacial tension damping is proportional to @xmath189 , which results in @xmath190 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : qx ] we show the behaviour of @xmath6 with @xmath0 for different kinds of disorder .",
    "the error bars are relatively large because the exact location of @xmath6 in the experimental power spectra is difficult to ascertain . for sq 1.50",
    "we find that @xmath191 , in good agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as we go to disorders of larger @xmath93 ( increasing persistence ) , @xmath192 tends to be less sensitive to @xmath0 . for t 1.50",
    "we observe that @xmath6 becomes independent of @xmath0 , within error bars .",
    "the reason can be understood in the framework of the following scenario : at a local level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : close - up ] ) the motion of the interface in the sq disorder can be viewed as a series of events formed by a period of nearly steady motion , a subsequent period of fast advance over a copper island ( accompanied by an abrupt change of sign of the in ",
    "plane curvature ) , and a third period of fast advance over fiber ",
    "glass due to relaxation of the local in  plane curvature .",
    "thus , damping of the short length scales due to the interfacial tension in the plane of the cell is basically effective only in this last period , when the interface depins from the copper islands . as the persistence of the disorder in the @xmath13 direction is larger",
    ", the relaxation periods are less frequent .",
    "this can be observed through the histogram of fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] .",
    "when we increase the persistence of the disorder changing from sq to sq - n , the number of the smallest copper aggregations reduces almost one order of magnitude . in the limiting case of t 1.50",
    "the disorder is continuous in the @xmath13 direction , and the damping role of the in  plane interfacial tension is effectively suppressed .     on velocity @xmath0 for three disorder configurations : sq 1.50 ( solid circles ) , sq - n 1.50 ( open circles ) and t 1.50 ( triangles).,width=325 ]",
    "we have presented new experiments of forced fluid imbibition in a hele  shaw cell with quenched disorder .",
    "we have used three main kinds of disorder patterns , sq , sq - n and t , characterized by an increasing persistence length @xmath93 in the direction of growth .",
    "we have measured a robust roughness exponent @xmath2 that is almost independent of the disorder configuration , interface velocity , and gap spacing , although the behaviour of the interfacial width presents important fluctuations both during growth and at saturation , that progressively disappear as the disorder is more persistent in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the roughness exponent @xmath3 , however , shows a clear dependence on the experimental parameters , as summarized in table  [ tab : main - results ] , discussed in the previous section .",
    "finally , we have focused on the dependence of the crossover wavenumber as a function of the interface velocity @xmath0 and @xmath93 . for the shortest @xmath93 , @xmath193 , and becomes independent of @xmath0 as the disorder is persistent in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the absence of pinning in experiments with disorders of increasing @xmath93 allows a detailed investigation of the regime of large capillary forces .",
    "this regime presents some interesting novel features which are studied in detail in ref.@xcite .",
