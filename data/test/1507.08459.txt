    "on 15 february 2013 at about 03:20 utc 17-meter asteroid entered the earth s atmosphere and exploded while travelling at a speed of 19 km / s .",
    "the body became a superbolide meteor , which was seen over the southern ural region . at the moment of maximum brightness , which occurred near the city of chelyabinsk , the meteor was brighter than the sun .",
    "the several small fragments of meteorite ( ordinary chondrite ) were quickly found on the west of chelyabinsk , with the largest fragment of total mass of 654 kg raised from the bottom of the chebarkul lake on 16 october 2013 ( popova et al . 2013 , brown et al .",

    "about 16 hours after chelyabinsk fireball occurrence the 45-meter asteroid 367943 duende ( 2012 da14 ) approached the earth and missed it by about 27 700 km .",
    "this was striking coincidence but subsequent analysis of the data clearly indicated the two objects could not have been related because they had widely different orbits ( wlodarczyk 2012 , moskovitz et al .",
    "2013 )    what is more interesting similar situation occurred over two years earlier . on the night of 2010",
    "oct 9/10 , mt .",
    "lemmon survey reported a discovery of a new 20-meter apollo type asteroid designated as 2010 tb54 ( hergenrother 2010 ) .",
    "the asteroid has been expected to pass only 6.1 lunar distance ( 0.011 au ) from the earth . over 11 hours earlier sky over central poland",
    "was illuminated by @xmath0 magnitude fireball .",
    "what is even more interesting these both bodies , contrary to chelyabinsk meteorite parent body and duende asteroid , seem to be related .",
    "in this paper we report an analysis of the multi - station observations of the pf131010 fireball made by cameras of the _ polish fireball network_. both the trajectory and orbit are calculated indicating that the fireball was related to 2010 tb54 asteroid .",
    "even closer resemblance of orbits is found for 2010 sx11 asteroid .",
    "the _ polish fireball network ( pfn ) _ is the project whose main goal is regularly monitoring the sky over poland in order to detect bright fireballs occurring over the whole territory of the country ( olech et al .",
    "2005 , odek et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 , winiewski et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it is kept by amateur astronomers associated in _",
    "comets and meteors workshop ( cmw ) _ and coordinated by astronomers from copernicus astronomical center in warsaw , poland .",
    "currently , there are over 20 fireball stations belonging to _ pfn _ which operate during each clear night .",
    "the pf131010 ciechanw fireball was observed by five _ pfn _ video stations ( table 1 ) : two of the recordings allowed us to determine the trajectory of the phenomenon , one recording includes observations made from a distance of over 400 km , another one features an initial part of the trajectory , and the last one noticed a bright reflection on clouds layer only .",
    "the most detailed and valuable recording comes from the pfn37 station in nowe miasto lubawskie , positioned 80 km north - east of toru ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . a camera with a 70-degree field of view registered its path in the southern direction diagonally through the field of view .",
    "the bolide appeared between the constellations of orion and the gemini as a point - like structure of about 2 magnitude .",
    "the brightness of the meteor increased quickly , and after 1.2 seconds the wake appeared . until about 3 seconds",
    "the bolide continued its luminous path as an object of about @xmath5 magnitude .",
    "the fireball started to lose its brightness in the middle of the visible trajectory , reaching a local minimum at about 4.6 second of the flight .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the observed final velocity of 5.8 km / s at the height of 29 km ( which most probably could descend even lower ) indicates a possible meteorite fall near grabowo , south of ostoka .",
    "an estimated impact point of the single meteorite weighing about 2 kilograms is about 22 kilometers of the final trajectory point , about 3.5  km to the left of the trajectory axis ( see fig .",
    "the exact coordinates of the impact point are @xmath6  n , @xmath7  e. calculations have been performed with assumption that only one fragment survived the ablation .",
    "the dynamic mass has been calculated using parameters observed at the end of the visible trajectory .",
    "the mass is given for chondrite body with bulk density of 3.7 @xmath8 and calculated using standard formulas ( ceplecha 1987 ) .",
    "because of huge trajectory uncertainties concerning the parameters observed in the final part of the trajectory the precision in determining the final place of impact amounts to about 3 km .",
    "an atmosphere profile , obtained during atmospheric probing performed on october 13 , 2010 at 00:00 ut ( the legionowo meteorological station located 65  km south of the terminal point ) , was used for the computations .",
    "a searching expedition was launched soon after the first rough estimates of results was determined , but their efforts were fruitless .",
    "after another manual measurement of the meteor position there was a new result ( presented here ) , slightly different from the previous one .",
    "the second expedition took place at the end of march 2015 , though without positive results either . the area",
    "( with active agriculture ) is not easy to search , with at least half of it not easily accessible .      based on the observational data we were able to determine the radiant of ciechanw fireball , its geocentric velocity and orbital parameters of the meteoroid which entered the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the orbital parameters are listed in the first row of table 3 * * , * * and the diagram showing orbit of the fireball in the inner solar system is displayed in fig .",
    "the orbit of ciechanw fireball is located almost in the ecliptic plane and has low eccentricity .",
    "the meteoroid hit the earth less than two months before perihelion passage which was expected on december 4 , 2010 at distance of @xmath9 au .",
    "comparison of the orbit of ciechanw fireball to orbits of near earth objects ( neo ) allowed us to select several asteroids with drummond criterion @xmath10 ( drummond 1979 ) .",
    "two of them are especially interesting .",
    "the 2010 tb54 asteroid has @xmath11 criterion value as small as 0.058 .",
    "what is more interesting this object passed within the distance of only 0.016 au from the earth on october 13 , 2010 at 14:14 ut , i.e. only 11.4 hours before the occurrence of the ciechanw fireball .",
    "this asteroid has been discovered by mount lemnon survey on october 9 , 2010 , its observing arc is 3 day long and based on 30 optical measurements .",
    "2010  tb54 has absolute magnitude @xmath12 magnitude , and its diameter is less than 29 meters .",
    "even lower drummond criterion value ( @xmath13 ) was noted for 2010 sx11 asteroid . the close encounter with this body occurred on october 11 , 2010 at 13:10 ut at the distance of 0.025 au .",
    "in this case the time difference amounts to 37.7 hours .",
    "2010 sx11 is a larger body , with absolute magnitude @xmath14 magnitude and diameter between 33 and 73 meters .",
    "observing arc span is 21 days , 33 optical measurements were used to determine orbital elements .",
    "uncertainties of orbital elements for both asteroids are similar but slightly smaller for 2010 sx11 .",
    "our results indicate the possibility that in period of october 11 - 13 there is an activity of meteor shower of asteroid origin with radiant located in the border of pisces and aries constellations .",
    "a numerical integration of the orbital parameters backwards in time has been performed in order to test the link between the fireball ciechanw and two neos : 2010 sx11 and 2010 tb54 . for the integrations of the asteroids and test particles representing fireball ,",
    "the radau integrator in the mercury software was used ( chambers 1999 ) .",
    "the model of the solar system used in integrations included : 8 planets , four asteroids ( ceres , pallas , vesta , and hygiea ) , and the moon as a separate body .",
    "the positions and velocities of the perturbing planets and the moon were taken from the de406 ( standish 1998 ) .",
    "the initial orbital elements of asteroids 2010 sx11 and 2010 tb54 were taken from jpl horizons website  .",
    "together with initial orbital elements of asteroids , the test particles were integrated to the same epoch of the beginning of the integration .",
    "next , the backward integration was continued for 5000 yr .    during the evolution ,",
    "the ascending and descending nodes of theoretical particles are dispersed within heliocentric distances from 0.8 to 1.8 au , with a concentration around earth s orbit . the generated stream has been widely dispersed in longitude , mostly by perturbation from the earth .",
    "therefore , application of a conventional similarity functions : @xmath15 ( southworth and hawkins 1963 ) , @xmath11 ( drummond 1981 ) , or @xmath16 ( jopek 1993 ) , would be strongly influenced in the longitude term in the d - criterion .",
    "due to it , we used ( steel 1991 ) criterion , @xmath17 , where the longitude term is not included .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show that the evolution of the @xmath17 criterion reveals a link between the ciechanw fireball and neos , with the values of @xmath17 being less than 0.15 through the whole integration time ( except one test particle when we compare orbits with 2010 tb54 and 2010 sx11 , respectively ) .",
    "the theoretical geocentric radiants of the asteroids has been determined using fortran code which is able to calculate radiant coordinates and theoretical stream orbit ( neslusan et al .",
    "theoretical radiants of asteroids and ciechanw meteoroid does nt match if calculated from present orbital elements .",
    "however similarity of the radiant is visible for back integrated orbital elements .",
    "distance between 2010  sx11 radiant and ciechanw radiant was close to 8.5 degrees 5000 years ago .",
    "also the theoretical radiant of 2010  tb54 was located in the same sky area , 7.5 degrees from the ciechanw radiant .",
    "five thousands years ago all theoretical radiants were closer than 10 degrees each other with geocentric discriminants @xmath18 for 2010  sx11 , @xmath19 for 2010tb54 and @xmath20 for ciechanw",
    ". change of radiant distances in time may suggest that age of possible stream is probably larger than 10000 years .",
    "in this paper we presented an analysis of the multi - station observations of a bright fireball which occurred over eastern poland .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * the meteor appeared on 2010 oct 12/13 at 02:52:32 ut over the eastern part of poland was detected by five video stations of _ polish fireball network _",
    ", * the maximum brightness of the fireball reached @xmath21 mag and was observed at height of @xmath22 km over ciechanw city , * the entry velocity was only @xmath1 km / s and after three seconds of flight the meteoroid was significantly decelerated with the rate of @xmath23 resulting with final velocity of only @xmath3 km / s , * low value of final velocity indicates a possible 2 kg meteorite fall near grabowo , south of ostoka , * the low eccentric orbit of the fireball , positioned almost in the ecliptic plane , is similar to orbits of 2010  tb54 and 2010  sx11 asteroids , which passed the earth 11.4 and 37.7 hours before the occurrence of the fireball , respectively , * numerical integration of the orbital elements backwards in time indicates that ciechanw fireball and 2010  tb54 and 2010  sx11 asteroids may have common origin .",
