    "the theoretical and experimental interest to generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) of hadrons is based on the facts that gpds :    * provide a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of hard exclusive processes ( deeply virtual compton scattering , deep exclusive electroproduction of mesons , etc . )",
    "that is based on the qcd factorization theorem , * extend the traditional one - dimensional ( longitudinal ) picture of hadrons to the full three - dimensional one , * help to understand the spin structure of hadrons in terms of underlying quarks and gluons .",
    "while the above points are valid for any hadronic target , nuclear gpds are interesting and important in their own right :    * nuclear gpds provide the information on nucleon gpds which is complimentary to that of the gpds of the free proton , * traditional nuclear effects ( nuclear binding , emc effect , nuclear shadowing ) are enhanced in nuclear gpds compared to the usual nuclear parton distributions , * nuclear gpds give an access to such novel ( or at least not well - established ) nuclear effects as the presence of non - nucleon degrees of freedom and medium modifications of the gpds of the bound nucleon .",
    "below we review recent theoretical results on each of the three aspects of nuclear gpds that we have just emphasized .",
    "since nuclei consist of protons and neutrons , models of nuclear gpds require proton and neutron gpds as input  @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements of deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) with nuclear targets in the coherent ( the target nucleus stays intact ) and incoherent ( the target nucleus breaks up ) regimes provide additional constraints on the nucleon gpds , which are complimentary to the information extracted from dvcs on a free proton .",
    "the examples include the completed and analyzed hermes measurement of dvcs on a range of nuclear targets ( @xmath0he , @xmath1n , @xmath2ne , @xmath3kr and @xmath4xe )  @xcite and the future high - precision measurement of dvcs on @xmath0he at jefferson lab  @xcite .",
    "the emc effect is the observation made by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) in 1983 that the nuclear structure function measured in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is smaller than the sum of the free nucleon structure functions , @xmath5 , for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of nucleons .",
    "after 25 years of investigations , there is no universally accepted explanation of the emc effect . in particular , the conventional nuclear binding mechanism explains only a small fraction of the observed emc suppression .",
    "hence , one hopes that the studies of the emc effect in dvcs with nuclear targets ( in off - diagonal kinematics ) may shed some light on the origin of the emc effect .",
    "the traditional nuclear binding effect in nuclear gpds can be taken into account using the impulse ( convolution ) approximation  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the quark gpd ( @xmath10 is the quark flavor ) in a nucleus ; @xmath11 is the quark gpd in the nucleon ; @xmath12 is the off - diagonal light - cone distribution of nucleons in the target nucleus .",
    "the involved gpds depend on the standard variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the light - cone fraction of the interacting nucleon .",
    "the calculation for @xmath17he using @xmath12 obtained with the off - diagonal spectral function and realistic nucleon - nucleon potential demonstrates that the  off - diagonal emc effect  , i.e.  the deviation of the ratio @xmath18 from unity , is larger than in the forward limit , strongly depends on the quark flavor and has the form , which is very different from the conventional emc effect  @xcite .",
    "this is a very important result for the interpretation of the nuclear dvcs data , which stresses that nuclear gpds have amplified conventional nuclear effects that should not be misinterpreted as new , exotic nuclear effects .",
    "one should also mention important results on the theory of gpds of the deuteron  @xcite and on the studies of the gpds of the deuteron in the impulse approximation on the light - cone  @xcite .      in inclusive dis with nuclear targets ,",
    "nuclear shadowing is the depletion of the nuclear structure function compared to the sum of the nucleon structure functions , @xmath5 , for @xmath19 .",
    "this also translates into nuclear shadowing for nuclear quark and gluon parton distributions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the origin of nuclear shadowing is fairly well - understood . in the target",
    "rest frame , it originates from multiple simultaneous interactions of the projectile with all nucleons of the target . observing that each interaction with the target nucleons has a diffractive character and using the qcd factorization theorem coupled with the qcd analysis of the hera data on inclusive diffraction in electron - proton dis , one arrives at the so - called leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing for nuclear pdfs .",
    "the leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing can be generalized to dvcs and to nuclear gpds  @xcite . in the resulting model ,",
    "nuclear shadowing in nuclear gpds is modelled using the gpds of the pomeron .",

    "[ fig : guzey_shadowing ] presents an example of the resulting predictions for nuclear shadowing for nuclear gpds as the ratio @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the nuclear form factor . in the absence of nuclear shadowing , @xmath23 .",
    "as one can see from the figure , the solid curve representing @xmath20 dips significantly below unity at small bjorken @xmath13 .",
    "this deviation from unity ( nuclear shadowing ) is larger than that for usual nuclear pdfs ( dotted curve ) .",

    "is given by the dotted curve .",
    "it is the effect of nuclear shadowing that causes the dramatic oscillations of @xmath27 for nuclear targets .",
    "properties of the bound nucleons are expected to be modified by the nuclear medium .",
    "the examples include the modifications of the structure functions ( emc effect ) and elastic form factors ( recoil polarization in quasi - elastic scattering on @xmath0he ) , suppression of the axial coupling constant , and many more .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that gpds of the bound nucleon are also modified in nuclei .",
    "such modifications can be probed in incoherent dvcs with nuclear target , and , in particular , by the future jefferson lab experiment with @xmath0he  @xcite .    recalling the connection between gpds and elastic form factors",
    ", one can propose a simple model that the bound nucleon gpds are modified in proportion to the corresponding elastic form factors  @xcite . for the medium modified elastic form factors ,",
    "the results of the quark meson - coupling model were used , which are consistent with the data on recoil polarization in quasi - elastic scattering on @xmath0he , see details in  @xcite .",
