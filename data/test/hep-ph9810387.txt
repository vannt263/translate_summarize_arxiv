    "the existence of the solar neutrino problem @xcite is now established more or less independently of any details of solar models .",
    "it was first recognized by bahcall and bethe @xcite that the observed rate in the @xmath0cl experiment @xcite is lower than the lower limit imposed by the 8 neutrino flux observed in the kamiokande experiment @xcite .",
    "the similar argument has been repeated @xcite with the @xmath1ga experiments @xcite .",
    "the outcome of these analyses can be phrased as the `` missing 7 neutrinos '' because there left little room for 7 neutrinos .",
    "the analysis has been made more systematic by a series of works that is categorized now as the `` model - independent analysis '' .",
    "this type of analysis was first attempted by spiro and vignaud @xcite and was established by hata , bludman and langacker @xcite . in both works the first use is made of the luminosity constraint which will be reviewed in appendix .",
    "an incomplete list of the subsequent relevant references are given in @xcite .",
    "the type of analysis was further refined by many people ; hata et al . @xcite and parke @xcite used the luminosity constraint to obtain the allowed region on two - dimensional ( e.g. , 7 @xmath5 8 flux ) plane .",
    "then , the most elaborated version of the luminosity constraint was formulated by bahcall and krastev @xcite who also obtained a parameter - independent constraint on various neutrino flux within the msw @xcite as well as the just so solutions @xcite of the solar neutrino problem . a detailed model - independent analysis without the luminosity constraint which also includes the effects of the @xmath6 and",
    "the cno neutrinos was carried out by heeger and robertson @xcite .",
    "the most important message from these model - independent analyses is that the solar neutrino problem can not be accounted for by astrophysical mechanisms unless some assumptions in the standard electroweak theory or solar neutrino experiments are grossly incorrect .    in this paper",
    ", we update the model - independent analysis of the solar neutrino problem by including the newest data of the high - statistics water cherenkov detector , superkamiokande @xcite , as well as those of the latest @xmath0cl @xcite and the @xmath1ga experiments @xcite .",
    "we also use the new values of the expected event rates in the solar neutrino experiments obtained in the latest standard solar model ( ssm ) calculation by bahcall and pinsonneault ( bp98 ) @xcite which was made available quite recently .",
    "our analysis will indicate that sensible astrophysical modifications of the solar model such as the low - temperature ( @xmath7 ) model @xcite is convincingly excluded by the present data .",
    "we also try to develop a new method for illuminating the suppression pattern of various solar neutrino flux originated from different fusion reactions in a less model - dependent fashion .",
    "it is aimed to bridge between the aforementioned model - independent analysis and the detailed analyses @xcite of the solar neutrino data based on the particular neutrino flavor conversion mechanisms such as the msw mechanism or the just - so solution .",
    "we will observe that the statement of the missing 7 neutrinos is no more true in the presense of neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "0.2 cm [ tab : data ]       for simplicity let us neglect the @xmath6 reaction and only consider the main @xmath9 reaction .",
    "one can justify the treatment because it has small termination of 0.4 % and furthermore it can be `` renormalized '' into the @xmath9 i chain defined above .",
    "irrespective of the termination of the each branch we can say that the total energy release ( or the luminosity ) must be proportional to the following quantity , @xmath10 where @xmath11 = 26.731 mev is the energy released by the net reactions ( [ ppreaction ] ) and @xmath12 ( i = i - iv ) denotes the neutrino flux produced through the termination of the corresponding chain . in eq .",
    "( [ totalenergy1 ] ) the energies carried away by neutrinos in each reaction chain are subtracted .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath13 is twice because two @xmath9 neutrinos are produced per termination of @xmath14 chain .",
    "( [ totalenergy2 ] ) leads to the luminosity constraint ( [ solarlumi ] ) presented in sec.iii of this paper .",
    "if we include all the flux from known fusion reactions in the sun the luminosity constraint can be written as @xcite @xmath18    this work was triggered by enlighting comments by kenzo nakamura at hachimantai meeting in october 28 - 30 , 1997 , iwate , japan , to whom we are grateful .",
