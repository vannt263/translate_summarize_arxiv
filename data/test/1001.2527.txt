    "most of this research have been devoted to condensed matter systems , where the electron spin constitutes the spin degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "however , related or equivalent phenomena may occur by considering the polarization of light  @xcite or internal zeeman levels of cold atoms exposed to optical light fields  @xcite or spatially varying magnetic fields  @xcite .    in many of the spintronics schemes developed in the condensed matter community , a spin - orbit ( so ) coupling plays a crucial role for the dynamics .",
    "the particular form of the so coupling can be of either rashba  @xcite or dresselhaus  @xcite type , both being frequently analyzed in terms of an effective gauge force  @xcite . in other words , one can interpret the so couplings as giving rise to an effective spin - dependent lorentz - type force .",
    "thus , the so coupling can serve as a spin - filter or a stern - gerlach apparatus . as the manufacturing techniques improves , undesired effects deriving from crystal impurities can be greatly suppressed and several successful experiments demonstrating the so coupling and its outings have been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite possess another possibility to implement effective so couplings , and the study of it within a clean environment . while in condensed matter settings where the coupling is an intrinsic property of the systems , for cold atoms it has to be externally created via spatially varying laser fields .",
    "ever since the pioneering experiments on bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite , the field has witnessed a tremendous progress both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the dispersive dipole coupling between light and atoms enables the possibilities to study matter waves in periodic potentials and the experimental realization of model systems discussed within theoretical solid state physics  @xcite .",
    "today , both the weakly interacting atomic gases as well as more strongly interacting ones can be realized experimentally .",
    "furthermore , utilizing the internal atomic hyperfine levels enable studies of the interplay between internal and external degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature is the realization of artificial gauge potentials by means of coupling of internal atomic zeeman levels  @xcite .",
    "the technique of light induced gauge potentials allows for non - abelian behavior to be analyzed and the so couplings are one such example  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the dynamics of a spinor bec subjected both to a two - dimensional weakly tilted optical square lattice as well to a set of spatially varying light fields giving rise to an effective so coupling between the internal atomic states .",
    "thereby , its dynamics will be driven by two mechanisms , namely ; ( i ) bloch oscillations ( bos ) arising due to the tilting of the lattice , and ( ii ) an intrinsic spin hall effect ( she ) deriving from the effective so coupling . the two phenomena may be analyzed in terms of an extrinsic force along the longitudinal direction of the lattice tilt and an intrinsic transverse force .",
    "being orthogonal to each other , these forces render a complex correlated motion of the bec in the lattice potential .",
    "furthermore , the particular form of the so coupling renders dirac cones characterized by linear dispersions reminiscent of relativistic electrons . as an outcome of these",
    ", the evolution possesses as well a trembling _ zitterbewegung _ motion  @xcite .",
    "normally , such effect damps out very fast @xcite , but we show that in a lattice situations as in the present paper it may indeed be long - lived and hence more easily observable . moreover , the optical lattice can serve as trapping potential for the atoms in the bo regime and no confining harmonic trap is needed which would typically prevent buildup of spin currents  @xcite .    while so couplings arise as an intrinsic property in many crystals , in cold atom systems it has to be implemented externally .",
    "this , at the one hand may be a source for experimental errors , but at the other it gives a handle for the so coupling ; its strength and form can be tuned experimentally .",
    "the same holds for the optical lattice , the lattice strength and geometry are both control parameters , which has made it possible to observe bos for becs in optical lattices  @xcite . due to the large atomic mass compared to the mass of the electron ,",
    "zitterbewegung is expectedly more clearly manifested in atomic systems .",

    "the full numerical results are presented , where we demonstrate the presence of a she and how it is modified by the longitudinal oscillatory motion . in particular , it is shown that the hall current will also oscillate , however with an increasing oscillation amplitude .",
    "on top of the oscillations deriving from the motion in a periodic potential , we find a persisting zitterbewegung effect . finally , we conclude with a summary in sec .",
    "rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus  @xcite so couplings appear in a variety of solids , ranging from semiconductors  @xcite , thin magnetic films  @xcite , to graphene  @xcite .",

    "one convenient feature of this method is that the wave function is in principle obtained at any instant of time in both position @xmath143 and momentum @xmath144 space .",
    "furthermore , for a system bounded from below , the approach is capable of giving an approximate ground state of the system by simply propagating it sufficiently long in imaginary time .    ,",
    "@xmath145 , and @xmath146 for all plots , @xmath147 in the upper plots ( a ) and ( b ) , and @xmath85 in the lower plots ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "thus , the lower plots correspond to the dispersions depicted in fig .",
    ", width=302 ]    our numerical considerations will focus on propagation of an initial ( approximated ) ground state for the untilted ( @xmath148 ) lattice .",
    "that is , we consider the ground state of a spin - orbit coupled bec in an optical lattice , and then we introduce a quantum quench by suddenly switch on a linear force in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "hence , we begin by propagating an ansatz function in imaginary time with zero extrinsic force @xmath148 .",
    "when convergence of the imaginary time evolution has been reached , we switch to real time propagation , including the extrinsic force by adding the potential term @xmath149 to the hamiltonian .",
    "as predicted by the acceleration theorem , for short times the weak forces @xmath93 will induce a linear increase in the quasi - momentum @xmath118 .",
    "in contrast to bos in a regular square lattice , here the so coupling implies that also the quasi - momentum @xmath150 is indirectly affected by the force @xmath93 . at the same time",
    ", the build up of motion in the @xmath21-direction induces an intrinsic force @xmath151 along the longitudinal @xmath20-direction of bos .",
    "in addition , the linear dispersions induce a trembling zitterbewegung motion .",
    "it is thereby likely to expect a complex motion arising from the interplay between the two forces related to she and bos and the outcomes from linear dispersions .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] displays the absolute values of the initial ground state wave function achieved via imaginary time evolution for @xmath148 .",
    "the momentum wave functions depicted in ( a ) and ( c ) demonstrate the jahn - teller effect as the ground state populates non - zero momentum states  @xcite .",
    "the lower two plots ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to the parameters of the two lowest bloch bands shown in fig .",
    "the fact that the ground state obtained from this numerical method is not symmetric , as seen from the plots , is believed to have a two - fold cause .",
    "first , it seems to derive from the fact that the imaginary time evolution is taken only up to a point where the state evolution has approximately converged , and , secondly , from the fact that even small fluctuations can result in an asymmetric ground state , due the four - fold degeneracy of the ground state of our hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the complete convergence of the ground state has not been reached since the position space wave functions depicted in ( b ) and ( d ) are localized in contradiction to the true ground state having a bloch structure , and furthermore since the momentum wave functions have a finite width .",
    "this , however , should not be seen as a shortcoming since normally one would cool the atomic gas in the presence of a confining potential which would result in a localized gas .",
    "in addition , if the propagated state extends over the full lattice one would run into troubles when quantities such as the mean spatial position is calculated numerically .",
    "note that the momentum wave functions of ( a ) and ( c ) are different from the quasi - momentum as is evident in the multiple bragg components separated by @xmath152 .",
    "in other words , even though the momentum wave functions extend beyond the first brillouin zone , it populates , to a very good approximation , only the lowest band .",
    "we also note that the position space ground state wave functions , shown in ( b ) and ( d ) , predominantly populate the individual lattice sites .",
    "hence , only judging from figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) and ( d ) it would be difficult to predict the presence of a so coupling and the dirac cones that derive from it , which instead manifest themselves in momentum space in terms of a jahn - teller effect .",
    "( a ) , average longitudinal position @xmath153 ( b ) , and average intrinsic force @xmath151 in the transverse direction ( c ) .",
    "red lines correspond to the dark state @xmath12 while green lines to @xmath13 . for @xmath153 the two lines are identical because of symmetry reasons .",
    "the dimensionless parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , but now with a non - zero extrinsic force , @xmath99 . ,",
    "width=302 ]    in order to analyze the interplay between the transverse and longitudinal forces , @xmath154 and @xmath113 , we calculate @xmath155 with @xmath78 corresponding to averages in terms of the two dark states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , @xmath156 , and the last quantity is the intrinsic force in the @xmath21-direction . we find that @xmath157 ( up to numerical accuracy ) and therefore plot only one of the two components .",
    "our numerical results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "the difference between the two figures lies in the scattering amplitude @xmath158 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the effective scattering amplitude @xmath158 is already as large as 10 recoil energies @xmath159 and we can thereby conclude that the spin current is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath158 . it is generally known that strong non - linearity can qualitatively change system properties . in becs",
    "it leads to phenomena such as soliton and vortex creation .",
    "normally the greatest impact of the non - linearity is seen around curve crossings  @xcite . beyond a critical value of the non - linearity ( in our case @xmath160 ) , in one dimension swallowtail loops are formed in the vicinity of the curve crossings characterizing additional stationary non - linear states , e.g. solitons .",
    "up to this critical value the dynamics seems rather insensitive at least on a mean - field level .",
    "however , formation of these loops beyond the critical value implies breakdown of the acceleration theorem  @xcite . to date",
    ", it seems that analysis of these effects have been restricted to one dimensional situations and it is therefore not fully understood how non - linearity affects the structure of the dirac cones appearing in two dimensions .",
    "nonetheless , we have numerically found that the general structure of figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] drastically change for very large values of @xmath158 .",
    "all present bo experiments , however , are performed in the weakly interacting regime where it is known that loops are absent , and we thereby restrict our analysis to these experimentally more relevant parameter ranges .",
    "we see from both fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] that the @xmath20 and @xmath21 motions are indeed correlated ; when the bloch oscillation reaches its turning points , the spin separation in the @xmath21-direction is roughly maximal and as the velocity in the longitudinal @xmath20-direction changes sign , the spin separation decreases due to the reversed sign of the intrinsic force .",
    "when the longitudinal velocity is the greatest ( equivalent to maxima of the intrinsic force @xmath151 ) , the spin current is reversed .",
    "more precisely , as the atoms begin to accelerate in the tilted lattice the quasi - momentum @xmath118 increases linearly in time and a spin current is built up in the transverse direction . however , after half a bloch period the quasi - momentum reaches the brillouin boundary and the @xmath20-motion is stopped and then reversed .",
    "consequently , also the spin current is reversed and one encounters a decreasing spin current in the @xmath21-direction .",
    "finally , the spin current has dropped to zero and builds up in the opposite direction instead .",
    "hence , the spin current follows the same oscillatory behavior as the bos .",
    "one may argue that a large spin separation should be hindered by the alternating sign of the velocity in the @xmath20-direction . nonetheless , from our numerical results depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , we note that the spin separation in the @xmath21-direction is relatively large .",
    "indeed , @xmath161 exceeds several site - spacings and furthermore this separation amplitude increases in time .",
    "the fact that neither the oscillatory spin nor the oscillatory longitudinal current show a clean perfect harmonic pattern derives from , at the one hand possible non - adiabatic effects and the breakdown of the acceleration theorem , and at the other that the transverse current induces an intrinsic force @xmath162 in the longitudinal direction which adds to the extrinsic force @xmath113 .",
    "the full coupled dynamics is therefore rather complex , but nonetheless , our figures make clear the overall in - phase oscillations between the two currents .    on top of the oscillations of @xmath163 , there is a slight drift toward negative values of @xmath20 .",
    "this is an outcome of non - adiabaticity and breakdown of the acceleration theorem .",
    "however , this drift is rather small and the dynamics is therefore predominantly adiabatic .",
    "this drift can be suppressed by increasing the lattice amplitude @xmath116 on the cost that the amplitude of longitudinal oscillations decreases .",
    "it would not , however , imply a diminishing she since it is related to the longitudinal momentum and not position",
    ".    a closer look at the two figures reveals that in the transverse motions there is an additional oscillating motion different from the spin current being in phase with the bos .",
    "this is believed to be zitterbewegung clearly seen in the freely evolving wavepackets of fig .",
    "contrary to that figure , here these oscillations do not collapse suggesting that it might be preferable to detect the zitterbewegung effect within a tilted lattice , compared to the case of freely propagating atoms .",
    "the survival of zitterbewegung should as well derive from the alternating motion due to the optical lattice .",
    "figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] have been calculated for an approximated initial ground state of the untilted lattice .",
    "as already pointed out , experimentally the condensate might be prepared in the presence of an external trap , and then the optical lattice as well as the coupling of the internal states are turned on in such a way that the condensate is not in a true ground state of the coupled system . to analyze the effect of such excitations",
    ", we have redone the simulations of figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] for an initial gaussian momentum state of a form depicted in eq .",
    "( [ gaussin ] ) with @xmath98 and @xmath88 .",
    "the results are very similar to the ones of figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , and we therefore do not present them here .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of a shallow harmonic potential in the transverse direction during the evolution in the tilted lattice .",
    "again , a transverse spin current is obtained , however this time the amplitude of transverse oscillations is decreased due to the confining potential .",
    "this reduction of spin separation would indeed be present in any experiment utilizing a confining trapping potential .",
    "the idea of employing an optical lattice potential as a trapping potential circumvent such shorting . in order to achieve trapping in this case",
    "one must stay within the bo regime , i.e. adiabatic . as figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] demonstrates , even though the atoms oscillate a relatively large spin current can build up during time .    in relation to the measurability of the spin separation",
    ", we may note that even though @xmath164 is considerably larger than the lattice spacing , it does not imply that the two wave functions @xmath165 and @xmath166 do not spatially overlap .",
    "in fact , the overlap is relatively large and fluorescent measurement of a single experimental run would therefore not contain sufficient information to reveal the spin current .",
    "however , this is hardly never the case in true experimental realizations and instead an ensemble of measurements should be considered , where the ensemble average gives @xmath164 . since",
    "this value is presumably larger than the lattice spacing , it should indeed be measurable  @xcite . in the cold atom community ,",
    "time - of - flight measurements are often employed , in which it is the atomic momentum density that is being measured . if the separation of the momentum wave functions is non - zero , the position space wave functions @xmath165 and @xmath166 will set apart further during the time - of - flight .",
    "if this separation is faster than the intrinsic wave function broadening , a finite time - of - flight measurement may enhance the detection efficiency .    , but with an increased atom - atom interaction",
    "; @xmath167 . , width=302 ]",
    "in this paper , we have considered an ultracold atomic system possessing three well - studied properties of condensed matter theory , bloch oscillations , intrinsic spin hall currents , and zitterbewegung.our motivation for this study comes from the fact that bloch oscillations have been verified in the same type of setups @xcite , light induced gauge potentials have been demonstrated @xcite , and zitterbewegung have been detected in ion - trap experiments  @xcite .    the spin - hall effect ( she ) and the bloch oscillations ( bo ) in our system are driven by two perpendicular forces : the extrinsic force appearing due to tilting of the lattice potential and the intrinsic force originating from the effective gauge potential caused by the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling .",
    "we demonstrated that the interplay between these two forces gives rise to a correlated motion in the @xmath19-plane , and despite the fact that the bos are expected to prevent a build up of large transverse spin currents , we argued that the she should indeed be detectable .",
    "we utilized system parameters that should be achievable in current experiments , e.g. , the amplitude of the lattice potential is five recoil energies compared to the experimentally utilized ones of ref .",
    "@xcite ranging from one to 14 recoil energies , and the so coupling two recoil energies compared to 8 recoil energies in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a potential amplitude as large as @xmath168 , the dispersions are almost flat and longitudinal",
    "motion is almost frozen .",
    "the momentum along the longitudinal direction do , however , oscillate within the brillouin size and , interestingly and somewhat surprisingly , one would therefore see an oscillating transverse spin hall current despite lack of longitudinal currents .",
    "we furthermore showed that the effects are insensitive to experimentally relevant atom - atom interaction strengths .",
    "entering a strongly interacting gas seemed to affect our results and we argue that this is likely to derive from a non - linearity induced breakdown of adiabaticity around the dirac points .",
    "an additional interesting aspect being discussed is the analogue of relativistic zitterbewegung .",
    "our numerical results indicate that it may be preferable to consider an optical lattice configuration when studying this effect since it persists over longer time periods .",
    "the optical lattice convey as well the possibility to avoid confining trapping potentials preventing large spin currents .",
    "we should also point out that the system presented in this paper allows for many extensions and different phenomena to be studied .",
    "for example , vortex generation in lattices  @xcite , bose - einstein condensation into non - zero momentum states  @xcite , topologically ordered states of matter  @xcite , or more strongly correlated systems , by means of second quantization of the mean - field hamiltonian , may find realization in atoms possessing an internal tripod structure and trapped in optical lattices .",
    "the flexibility permits as well for various extensions , for example time - dependent lattices or so couplings . a recent paper considered zitterbewegung of ultracold atoms for a driven so coupling  @xcite .",
    "the same idea can be utilized in order to increase the transverse spin current in our model .",
