    "the phenomenon of quantum interference can be used to control physical and chemical processes .",
    "one approach , the ` @xmath3 ' scheme , uses a two - color light field to interfere @xmath4- and @xmath5-photon transitions @xcite .",
    "interference between one- and two - photon transitions , for example , allows controllable polar asymmetry of photoelectrons in atomic ionization @xcite , controllable dissociation of hd@xmath6 @xcite , and controllable photocurrent injection in unbiased solids due to free carrier absorption @xcite , impurity - band transitions @xcite , and quantum well bound - continuum intersubband transitions @xcite . in biased asymmetric semiconductor double wells , ` @xmath7 ' interference allows control of carrier population and thz emission @xcite .",
    "interband ` @xmath7 ' interference in unbiased semiconductors , which is our interest here , allows independent control of electrical current injection @xcite and spin current injection @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors , it allows independent control of carrier populations ( i.e. , absorption ) @xcite and carrier spin polarization @xcite . in each scenario ,",
    "the experimenter can control the interference by adjusting the phases of the two colors .",
    "the controllable optical phases are not the only source of phase between the transition amplitudes . in general , there is also a material - dependent intrinsic phase @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the intrinsic phase appears as a phase shift in the dependence of the process on a relative phase parameter of the optical fields .",
    "additionally , selectivity between two processes is possible when their intrinsic phases differ @xcite ; for example , ` 1 + 3 ' experiments on diatomic molecules have controlled the branching ratio of ionization and dissociation channels @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic phase can be strongly frequency dependent near resonances @xcite , and the hope that it might serve as a new spectroscopic observable @xcite has led to efforts to understand its physical origin .    whereas a resonance is necessary for a phase shift to a ` 1 + 3 ' process @xcite , it is not necessary for a phase shift to a ` 1 + 2 ' process .",
    "for example , an intrinsic phase in the ` 1 + 2 ' photoionization of atoms is predicted from the simple model of a delta function potential @xcite .    nevertheless , microscopic theories for the interband ` @xmath7 ' processes in bulk semiconductors have until now predicted trivial intrinsic phases @xcite .",
    "the photocurrent , for example , was predicted to be proportional to the sine of the relative phase parameter for all final energies @xcite .",
    "each of these theories use the independent particle approximation , in which the coulomb attraction between the injected electron and hole is neglected .",
    "that approximation is expected to be good for final energies well above the band gap , since in this case the electron and hole travel quickly away from each other .",
    "however , close to the band gap , one generally expects to see deviations from the independent particle approximation . in the one - photon absorption spectrum , for instance",
    ", it is well known that the electron - hole attraction is responsible for exciton lines below the band gap , and for an enhancement of the absorption above the gap known as _",
    "sommerfeld _ or _",
    "coulomb enhancement _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effect of the electron - hole attraction on one - photon absorption has been studied with various degrees of sophistication . on the one hand , modern _ ab initio _ calculations that include coulomb effects",
    "have recently given very good quantitative agreement with experimental spectra @xcite , although at the cost of significant computational overhead .",
    "on the other hand , simple models of wannier excitons can describe coulomb effects near the band edge of many direct gap semiconductors .",
    "these excitonic effects have long been understood qualitatively on the basis of a simple two - band model in the effective mass approximation @xcite , which is even quantitatively accurate for typical semiconductors @xcite .",
    "excitonic effects on nonlinear optical properties of bulk semiconductors have also been studied in the effective mass , wannier exciton approximation @xcite and only recently with _ ab initio _",
    "methods @xcite .",
    "the two - photon absorption spectrum shows a different set of exciton lines and a coulomb enhancement that is weaker than its one - photon counterpart .",
    "one- and two - photon absorption spectra have been measured sufficiently often that excitonic effects on them are well established .",
    "in contrast , semiconductor ` 1 + 2 ' interference experiments have been done typically at only a single energy and typically many exciton binding energies above the band - gap . moreover",
    ", these initial experiments lacked an absolute calibration of the relative optical phase , and thus were insensitive to the intrinsic phase .",
    "such a calibration is possible @xcite , and could be used to verify the predictions we present here .",
    "a nontrivial intrinsic phase would have implications for the use of ` @xmath7 ' current injection as an absolute measurement of the carrier - envelope phase of an ultrashort optical pulse @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we extend the theory of ` 1 + 2 ' coherent control of bulk semiconductor interband transitions beyond the independent particle approximation , employing a set of approximations that are valid close to the @xmath8 point of a direct gap bulk semiconductor .",
    "our investigation is limited to a perturbative treatment in the fields . in this limit of low photoinjected carrier density",
    ", the only inter - particle interaction of importance is that between a single electron and hole . we show that , due to the electron - hole attraction , a nontrivial phase shift does in fact occur in the control of current and spin current , but not in the control of carrier population or spin polarization .",
    "the intrinsic phase can be understood in terms of partial wave phase shifts due to the coulomb potential between electron and hole .",
    "in addition , we find an enhancement of each process , and relate it to the coulomb enhancements of one- and two - photon absorption .    in the next section",
    ", we establish notation necessary to describe the ` 1 + 2 ' processes in terms of one- and two - photon transition amplitudes . in section [ sec : model ] , we present the microscopic model .",
    "the transition amplitudes are worked out in section [ sec : transition_amplitudes ] .",
    "the final expressions for the ` 1 + 2 ' effects are given in section [ sec : results ] , and numerical results for gaas are presented . in section [ sec : discussion ] , further understanding of the enhancement and intrinsic phase is discussed , and we examine the ratios often used as figures of merit for ` 1 + 2 ' effects .",

    "the fourth rank tensor @xmath11 , called the current injection tensor , describes the material response .",
    "it is purely imaginary in the independent particle approximation @xcite , but can be complex in general .",
    "we define the intrinsic phase @xmath12 of the component @xmath13 as @xmath14 so that it is zero or @xmath15 in the independent particle approximation .",
    "when the electron - hole interaction is included in the set of approximations used below , all the components of @xmath16 have the same phase .",

    "coulomb effects other than the excitonic effects we consider here play a role in scattering , especially at high densities of excited carriers .",

    "but the first two terms vanish for centrosymmetric crystals , and the first vanishes even for zincblende crystals ; we neglect them here .",
    "excitonic effects on the first term were studied by shelest and ntin @xcite .",

    ", we have @xmath34    even if scattering from impurities and phonons is neglected , the injection current described by ( [ currentmicro ] ) does not capture the full current density ; there are also optical rectification and ` shift ' contributions to the current @xcite .",

    ", the different time dependencies of the three current contributions allows for their separate examination experimentally , at least in principle , and rough order - of - magnitude estimates indicate that typically the injection current will be the largest ; it is the only contribution to the current we treat here .    as in ( [ currentmicro ] )",
    ", the carrier injection rate can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath4 is the number density of injected electron - hole pairs .",

    "however , since one- and two - photon absorption are insensitive to the phases of the transition amplitudes , those calculations took no care to get the phases of the transition amplitudes correct . in the next two sections we find the transition amplitudes with the correct phases including excitonic effects",

    "many approximate approaches to band structure calculation , including most pseudopotentials , and the truncation to a finite number of bands , implicitly assume an underlying field - free hamiltonian that is nonlocal ; there is then a correction to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath63 in the velocity gauge @xcite .",

    "our focus in this paper is on the unbound solutions to ( [ exciton_schrodinger ] ) ; bound exciton states lack relative velocity between the electron and hole , and hence do not contribute to the ballistic current or spin current . for a fermi s golden rule calculation of the current or spin current , the unbound state must behave asymptotically like an outgoing plane wave in the relative coordinate between electron and hole ; @xmath83 is the wavevector of the outgoing plane wave . specifically , we must use `` ionization states '' rather than scattering states @xcite , as was done for atomic ` 1 + 2 ' ionization @xcite .",

    "calculations of one- or two - photon absorption are insensitive to an error in this choice of boundary condition , but the present calculation is not , since it is sensitive to the relative phase of the transition amplitudes .    the ionization state wavefunctions that solve ( [ exciton_schrodinger ] ) can be expressed as a sum over partial waves , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the exciton bohr radius , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 mean @xmath89 and @xmath90@xcite .",

    "even though this approximation neglects band warping , nonparabolicity , and inversion asymmetry , the hamiltonian lacks analytic eigenstates @xcite .",
    "this is essentially due to the degeneracy of the @xmath94 and @xmath95 bands at the @xmath93 point . as a result of the difference between @xmath97 and @xmath98",

    "the effect of envelope - hole coupling has been studied for exciton bound states @xcite , but not for optical processes involving unbound excitons in the continuum .    even within this model ,",
    "the presence of multiple bands provides two types of terms in the sum over intermediate states in the two - photon amplitude : two - band terms , in which the intermediate and final states are in the same exciton series [ i.e. , two states of the form ( [ final state ] ) with the same @xmath66 and @xmath65 ] , and three - band terms , in which the intermediate and final states are in different series .",

    "the two - photon transition amplitude is more difficult to deal with due to the sum over intermediate states ; however , in our set of approximations it has been done exactly @xcite .    in order to proceed analytically",
    ", it is common to use ( [ vac_pairvelocity ] ) and ( [ twotwovelocity ] ) , and then make an expansion in @xmath0 of the velocity matrix elements @xmath114 about the @xmath8 point @xcite .",
    "however , due to the degeneracy at the @xmath8 point , the coefficients of such an expansion can depend on the direction of @xmath0 @xcite . to proceed , we note that wannier excitons have large spatial extent and hence only a small region of wavevectors is important for them , i.e. , @xmath115 is peaked in the region of @xmath0 near @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for final states with energies above the band gap .",
