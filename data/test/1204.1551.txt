    "catastrophes as defined in the abstract are related to a class of phenomena sometimes called `` relaxation '' oscillations .",
    "the observation of two widely separated time scales makes relaxation oscillations a good a priori subject of theoretical investigation , because one may suspect that their formation results from the existence of a ( more or less hidden ) small parameter .",
    "this gives some hope of a `` general '' theory based upon the small size of the parameter .",
    "to take an example , some major earthquakes lasting a few tens of seconds occur in the same general area about every hundred years .",
    "they thus involve a ratio of ` typical ' times in the neighborhood of @xmath0 , which is a very small number . in the present study",
    "a laboratory experiment was devised which displays similar relaxation oscillations , but acting time - wise on a scale that is convenient for investigation .",
    "experimental observations are explained in light of a two - part _ dynamical bifurcation _ model of catastrophe . comprising the local form of a physical model shown to be valid when close to the catastrophe , the striking result is as follows . in response to an external source of noise the two models ( the local one and the physical one ) predict fluctuations with a correlation time that increases before the catastrophe , just as is observed experimentally .",
    "the important point is that this well known critical slowing down phenomenon occurs significantly _ before _ the transition and could be used to forewarn it .",
    "we study the creeping of a soft metal under constant stress .",
    "accurate time records show that this creeping actually displays the following time dependent noisy component .",
    "the wire typically lengthens slowly with background ( non - thermal ) noise , with sometimes a `` large '' sliding event , followed again by a noisy slow lengthening regime , etc .",
    "plastic deformation of solids is a complex phenomenon , not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "it has long been observed to take place in a non - smooth manner .",
    "most studies have focused on the portevin - le chatelier effect observed under constant strain rate conditions , whereas the present experiment is concerned with creep at constant stress . in both cases large steps ( cyclic slips )",
    "are embedded in a noisy background .",
    "there is a general agreement that this is due to the complex dynamics of networks of dislocations whose motion is a means for the stressed solid to flow . as reported in section [ sec : experiment ] below , careful observations of the creep in strained sn - pb quasi - eutectic material ( a solder wire ) show the following :    _ i ) _ on average a sample under constant stress lengthens at constant rate .    _",
    "ii ) _ continuous monitoring shows time dependent fluctuations of this length superposed on its secular increase .",
    "_ iii ) _ from time to time the length jumps by steps . afterwards a noisy and steady ( on average ) length increase is recovered until the next jump , etc .    explaining all this remains a challenge for the common models of creep .",
    "nevertheless it is of great interest because it can be seen as a laboratory model of other far less accessible phenomena like earthquakes , where on average there is also a continuous slow sliding with random microseismic noise , interrupted by large fast sliding steps characterizing major earthquakes .",
    "we recently introduced the idea @xcite that in such systems the slow to fast transition can be described by a saddle - node bifurcation in a dynamical system evolving slowly with time .",
    "we pointed out the interest in such a modelization , which allows one to theoretically predict the response of this dynamical system to a noise source .",
    "it was shown that the induced fluctuations drift toward low frequencies ( i.e. , toward large correlation times ) _ before _ the transition , and so could be used as a forewarning .    here",
    "we show that the dynamical saddle - node bifurcation model is the reduced form of a set of equations previously used to describe the portevin - le chatelier effect in metals , or metallic alloys , i.e. , the ananthakrishna ( ak ) model @xcite .",
    "the saddle - node model describes fast transitions resulting from the intrinsic dynamics of the original system which can be described locally ( close to the step ) as a slowly rocking potential system .",
    "using the ak model as well as the saddle - node reduced model we show that , with an added external source of noise , the correlation time of the fluctuations increases before the transition , following the classical scenario of slowing down at bifurcation points . as was shown long ago by dorodnytsin @xcite",
    ", the same local dynamics describe the transition from slow manifold to fast transients in relaxation oscillations of dynamical models , like the van der pol equation in the strongly nonlinear limit . by looking at the fluctuations of the length of our samples",
    ", we found this behavior near the step - like transitions , with the characteristic drift to low frequencies before the transition .    unlike recent publications that have presented the idea @xcite that precursors of earthquakes could be found in the mechanical response to external perturbations ( such as the increase of the fluctuations and their slowing down near transitions ) our idea goes further , by giving an order of magnitude of the precursor time",
    "the authors of @xcite do not introduce the effect of a given time dependence of the parameters and consider only systems with steady parameter values on both sides of the bifurcation . to quote reference @xcite",
    "`` the suggested approach to analytical study of any kind of catastrophes is based essentially on the solution of a stationary problem of the possibility and conditions of the unstable equilibrium state in the system in question '' . without taking into account explicitly the time dependence of the parameters sweeping the bifurcation set ,",
    "it is impossible to get the time scale for predictions . as we show",
    ", this scale depends crucially on the rate of change of the parameters near the bifurcation , which may be estimated from the knowledge of the ratio of the two time scales ( fast and slow ones ) for saddle - node models .",
    "an important challenge lies in the difficulty of stating a suitable model for a given catastrophic event .",
    "actually there is more than one class of possible slow - to - fast transitions in dynamical systems .",
    "the dynamical saddle - node can be seen as belonging to the class of systems with an equilibrium point losing stability as a parameter changes .",
    "it is not a loss of stability , but rather a loss of existence of the equilibrium point , occurring at the folding point of the slow manifold .",
    "however slow - to - fast transition may happen without any folding of the slow manifold .",
    "as shown in @xcite exploring a very often used mathematical representation of stick - slip behavior , the dieterich - ruina equations , the slow - fast transition can originate from the finite time singularity of the slow dynamics itself . in that case , critical speed - up , or drift of fluctuations toward large frequencies , is found to replace the critical slowing - down effect .",
    "this nonlinear phenomenon is obviously outside the class of phenomena explainable by a stability analysis of equilibria of dynamical systems .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the paper on this subject @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we do not consider this case , because it is clearly not the one observed in the creeping experiments .",
    "note that at this time it is unknown if real earthquakes ( as well as other observed catastrophes ) belong to the saddle - node case with a slowing - down near the transition or to the finite time singularity case with speed - up expected .",
    "the creeping experiment is described in section [ sec : experiment ] together with the striking spectral observations .",
    "in the two sections following section [ sec : experiment ] , we present our theoretical approach . we introduce in section [ sec : dynsaddbif ] an abstract dynamical model showing fast jumps . in this model",
    ", one assumes that , as a dynamical system , the jump follows a `` saddle - node '' bifurcation .",
    "there a pair of fixed points , one locally stable , the other locally unstable , merge and disappear as a control parameter changes .",
    "afterwards , the system moves quickly to a new equilibrium state that is at finite distance ( in phase space ) from previous equilibria , whence the jump . after reviewing the saddle - node bifurcation in this light , we assume that the parameter changes with time , namely that the parameter defining the bifurcation is itself a slow function of time .",
    "when , by this change , the parameter crosses the bifurcation value , the dynamical system makes an abrupt transition and jumps `` generically '' from one equilibrium state to another . in section [ sec : ak ] we show that this `` abstract '' model is pertinent for describing the slow - fast transition in the relaxation regime of a set of equations derived by ananthakrishna for creeping in the relaxation regime .",
    "this set of equations describes the dynamics of populations of dislocations in the creeping solid .",
    "the model shows relaxation oscillations in which slow drift is interrupted by fast variations . near the slow - fast transition",
    ", we show that this model reduces to the generic equation quoted above , for a certain range of parameters .",
    "therefore it displays a typical critical slowing - down in its response to external noise , in agreement with the real data reported in section [ sec : experiment ] . of particular interest",
    "is the fact that , from the experimental data , one can predict in advance a `` large slip '' event .",
    "the event is preceded by a shift toward low frequencies in the random fluctuations of specimen length .",
    "choose a uniform``wire '' that creeps under small stress at room temperature , fabricated from a much studied material , sn - pb solder , alloyed to be nearly eutectic .",
    "to establish creep at virtually constant stress , let one end of the wire be fixed and at the other end establish a constant force of tension . by this",
    "means we found the length of the wire to increase on average at constant rate .",
    "by highly accurate monitoring of this length vs time we observed a small time dependent part with the following pattern : on a background of fluctuations , from time to time a large slip event was observed , after which the continuous lengthening with a small background noise was recovered .",
    "the observed noise is non - thermal , since thermal noise has a far too small amplitude to be relevant .",
    "it is assumed to result from rearrangement of defect structures in the poly - crystalline structure of the quasi - eutectic , involving dislocation dynamics .",
    "we assume that this noise originates from a source that is to first - order independent of the overall lengthening of the wire .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that it is due to ongoing micro - scale events triggered by the imposed stress , independent of the global creeping .",
    "therefore we analyzed the response to this noise source according to the ak equations subject to an external noise ( see below ) .",
    "the instrument used in these experiments , which is pictured in fig.[fig : solder ] , is an extensometer @xcite .",
    "young s modulus can be accurately measured with a wire specimen , by placing different size masses on the weight pan .",
    "the trace of the vertical wire holding up the boom / weight pan in fig.[fig : solder ] has been enforced ( colored in black ) to be visible in the image .",
    "though not presently used , the black clamp was for purpose of holding a power resistor that was employed to measure the specimen s thermal coefficient of expansion . to measure temperature changes ,",
    "a solid state thermometer was placed down into the sample space , through the hole seen near the top knurled clamp .",
    "@xmath1   @xmath1    to calibrate the instrument a tungsten wire of diameter 0.1 mm was mounted in the extensometer , and signal output level changes were recorded as various gram - mass standards were placed on the weight pan . by using the known young s modulus for tungsten , the resulting measurements yielded a constant of 1.0 nm per analog to digital count , for the 24 bit adc employed , which is sold by symmetric research @xcite .",
    "this constant is applicable to the data presently reported .",
    "a different measurement technique yielded essentially the same calibration constant .",
    "a he - ne laser was used with a mirror , operating as an optical lever , to measure boom position change as different masses were placed on the pan .    on the basis of two factors ,",
    "ordinary solder was chosen for the present study .",
    "first of all , an unusual property of tin is well known , when an ingot of the metal is strained by large amounts .",
    "the sound which it then emits is well described by the german word  zinngeschrei \" , which translates `` tin cries '' .",
    "the initiative for this work was also influenced by the observation of unusual spectral features in the output from a novel seismograph @xcite .",
    "the unusual low - frequency motions of the earth s crust that were then observed to precede an earthquake @xcite are readily seen by the volksmeter .",
    "this is due to the instrument s use of a `` displacement '' sensor , rather than the `` velocity '' sensor used by conventional seismometers .",
    "it was therefore natural to consider an alloy of tin , with the expectation that its defect properties should be more like those of the earth than is possible for a pure metal .",
    "the tin alloy for our study was ordinary soft solder ( 60% sn/ 40% pb ) , used universally in the electronics industry .",
    "although the pure ` eutectic ' alloy is actually 63% sn/37% pb , we will nevertheless use this word to describe our specimen in the discussions that follow .",
    "the stress level due to the load placed on the pb - sn wire used in the present experiments was considerably smaller than the typically @xmath2 used in usual creep studies .",
    "the present load was due solely to the weight of aluminum comprising the boom plus empty weight pan of the extensometer .",
    "this stress value was estimated to be @xmath3 , based on considerations that include the distance of the wire s attachment point from the position of the ( fine ) roller bearing in the unpright housing , that supports the boom on its end opposite the pan .",

    "afterwards , however , we explain that a model of creeping shows the same slowing down in a range of parameters , linked to a local saddle - node bifurcation .",

    "although this is not obvious from its formulation , this model is also valid for the transition from slow to fast motion in the van der pol oscillator in the limit of large non linearities , as shown by dorodnitsyn @xcite .",
    "let us sketch the proof of this ( interesting ) point .",
    "actually we shall look at the formally more general situation of relaxation oscillations , namely at solutions of a set of coupled ode s ( ordinary differential equations ) with a large parameter in the form : @xmath55 and @xmath56 in this set of equations dots are for time derivatives and the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are smooth with values of order @xmath59 when their argument is also of order one .",
    "moreover , @xmath60 is a large parameter .",

    "the first term coming from the expansion with respect to @xmath79 is @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath50 and @xmath78 small , the equation for @xmath85 derived from ( [ eq : relax1 ] ) reads : @xmath86 one can check that all terms not written explicitly there are effectively negligible compared to the ones kept .",
    "standard rescalings allows to transform the equation ( [ eq : relax3 ] ) into the `` universal '' equation ( [ eq : gradt ] ) , provided various constraints of sign are satisfied by the quantities @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 all computed at @xmath72 .",
    "this is a short version of the classical calculation by dorodnycsin , showing that the `` universal '' equation ( [ eq : gradt ] ) is also relevant for the slow to fast transitions in relaxation oscillations .",
    "it is worth mentioning also that this derivation does not really assume that the overall motion is periodic , as it may be extended quite easily to a system of many more coupled ode s with only one fast variable .",
    "this shows that such large jumps are also possible in non periodic dynamics , because the dynamics on the slow manifold may be chaotic in between the jumps if this slow manifold has a number of dimensions sufficiently large .",
    "now we shall focus on the slowing down near the dynamical saddle - node bifurcation described by equation ( [ eq : gradt ] ) .",
    "we shall first give its explicit solution .",
    "we look for a solution of equation ( [ eq : gradt ] ) transiting from the `` stable '' fixed point at `` large '' negative times to the rolling down towards positive value of @xmath46 at positive times .",

    "it is the airy function @xmath96 which writes    @xmath97    yet we have only solved the transient problem near the saddle - node bifurcation .",

    "it corresponds to a divergence of @xmath100 , which behaves as    @xmath101    just before this transition , as derived by expanding @xmath102 close to @xmath103 .",
    "therefore the `` generic '' equation ( [ eq : gradt ] ) for the dynamical saddle - node bifurcation displays a finite time singularity .",
    "let us precise the following mathematical subtlety .",
