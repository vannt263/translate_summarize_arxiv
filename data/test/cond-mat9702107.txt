    "the simplest way to describe kinetic phenomena is by the boltzmann equation ( be ) .",
    "there are however cases when the be can not be used , and one has to use quantum kinetic equations ( qkes ) that are in the simplest case equations for the one particle green functions . if the keldysh technique @xcite is used , the one particle green functions that participate in the description of kinetic processes are the retarded green function ( and its complex conjugate ) , and the `` statistical '' green function , which is simply the field correlator . for free particles these green functions are diagonal in the basis of the free particle states , and are described by the free particle energies @xmath0 , and their occupation numbers @xmath1 .",
    "these are the quantities that appear in the be for the _ interacting _ particles _ in external fields_.    the description of kinetic phenomena by qkes instead of bes results in two effects .",
    "the first effect is state mixing - due to interactions and external fields the green functions are nondiagonal in the basis of the free particle states .",
    "this effect is responsible for coherence phenomena , of which a well known example is interband polarization described by semiconductor bloch equations @xcite .",
    "the second effect is level shift and broadening - the green functions are nonzero off the energy shell within some width defined by the interactions and the external fields .",
    "level broadening effects in qkes for phonons have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effects of level broadening are of importance in two cases .",
    "the first case is that in which level broadening allows scattering processes that are forbidden by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "an example of such a case is that of electron - electron scattering in a 2deg , in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field @xcite . if one tries to calculate the auger transition rates responsible for anti - stokes luminescence , that was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , using fermi s golden rule , one encounters delta functions with an argument equal to zero , due to singularities in the density of states , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second case in which level broadening effects should be considered is that of narrow energy distributions : when there are small energy scales in the problem that are narrower than the quantum width of the state .",
    "a simple example of such a case , that has one small energy scale , is that of an electron distribution , excited by a narrow band - width laser . the problem becomes more complex when another small energy scale is added , for example : the electrons are excited to the close vicinity of some threshold .",
    "a problem of this nature will be dealt with in this paper .    in the time domain ,",
    "level shift and broadening lead to non - markovian effects in the scattering processes @xcite .",
    "these effects are important in the case of short excitation pulses @xcite .",
    "if state mixing induced by coherent excitation can be neglected , and only shift and broadening effects are considered , the qkes can be presented in a form similar to the bes",
    ". we will give a general recipe how to write such equations , and will use this recipe when considering the following problem : hot luminescence from a quantum wire ( qwr ) due to electrons that are excited by a narrow band , noncoherent laser , to the close vicinity of the threshold for optical lo phonon emission .",
    "optical and transport phenomena in qwrs have been of great interest lately .",
    "the great interest in transport phenomena @xcite is due to the possibility that a 1deg in a qwr will have the properties of a luttinger liquid .",
    "the fermi edge singularity @xcite and the possibility of stimulated emission @xcite enlarged interest in optics of qwrs .",
    "the important role played by lo phonons in the trapping of electrons @xcite from three - dimensional extended states , into one - dimensional localized states , has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of qwrs were concentrated around elementary excitations of a 1deg @xcite , fermi edge singularity @xcite , excitonic effects @xcite , electron - phonon scattering rates @xcite and interactions @xcite , relaxation of photoexcited carriers @xcite , calculation of envelope states @xcite , and conductance of qwrs with self - consistent broadening effects @xcite .",

    "the square brackets with a plus ( minus ) sign signify an anticommutator ( commutator ) .",
    "the upper signs refer to fermions and the lower signs refer to bosons ( this convention is used throughout the paper ) .",

    "the upper ( lower ) term in the column corresponds to fermions ( bosons ) .",
    "the occupation number of state @xmath19 , @xmath25 , is not necessarily the equilibrium occupation number .    in the case of interacting particles in external fields , if one neglects coherence effects , the green functions are still diagonal in @xmath19 , but the energy levels are broadened and shifted .",
    "let us first look at the time invariant case ( systems under d.c .",
    "conditions ) .",
    "the level shift @xmath26 , and the level broadening @xmath27 , are defined as @xmath28       { \\rm i m } \\sigma^{\\rm r}_{\\alpha}(\\epsilon),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the retarded self energy of particles in state @xmath19 .",
    "the column has the same meaning as in expression ( [ gr0-ae ] ) .",
    "the retarded green function is an outcome of the dyson equation ( [ dyson ] ) , that is written as @xmath30 in the representation of the @xmath19 states . using the defintions ( [ s - w - def ] )",
    "we obtain from equation ( [ dyson - gr ] ) ( for positive frequencies ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the `` smeared '' and `` shifted '' principal value , and @xmath33 is the `` smeared '' and `` shifted '' delta function .    comparing expression ( [ gr - ae ] ) with expression ( [ gr0-ae ] ) we see that @xmath34 is in fact a generalization of @xmath35 , where the level shift and level width have been introduced into the principal value and delta functions .",
    "we therefore write @xmath36 as a generalization of @xmath37 , thus defining the occupation functions @xmath38 @xmath39    expressions ( [ gr - ae ] ) and ( [ gs - ae ] ) were written for the case of positive frequencies , which will be assumed from now on . in case of negative boson frequencies one has to multiply the retarded green function and @xmath40 in these expressions by minus one .",
    "the definitions above agree with the relation between the statistical green function and the retarded green function at thermal equilibrium @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the equilibrium distribution function ( fermi or bose - einstein ) .",
    "the smeared delta function obeys the following normalization @xmath43 and the occupation numbers are obtained from the occupation functions in the following manner @xmath44    relations ( [ equil ] ) - ( [ on - of ] ) can be obtained from the lehmann representation of the green functions .",
    "these relations are valid only if the one particle green functions can be considered as diagonal in @xmath19 , in other words , in the absence of coherence effects .    as a result of definitions ( [ s - w - def ] ) and ( [ gs - ae ] ) ,",
    "the three unknown functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 have been replaced by a different set of three unknown functions : @xmath47 and @xmath38 .",
    "if the system is not under d.c .  conditions , one can define a new pair of time variables : the relative time @xmath48 , and the `` center of mass '' time @xmath49 .",
    "only slow processes will be considered so that all quantities vary in @xmath50 with some time scale that is large compared to the inverse characteristic energy of the particles . in such a case one can still use the formalism given above for the green functions , but with @xmath50 as a parameter of the problem , in addition to @xmath51 ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for slow processes @xmath52",
    "again @xmath53 can be written as a generalization of @xmath35 , in the same manner as before , but now @xmath50 is a parameter which appears in all functions .",
    "thus , expressions ( [ gr - ae ] ) and ( [ gs - ae ] ) for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , can be used with the three unknown functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 that depend on @xmath50 as well as on @xmath51 .",
    "the known procedure for obtaining a kinetic equation for @xmath57 is to apply the operator @xmath58 to the dyson equation for @xmath59 @xcite , where the operator @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 for electrons , and @xmath62 for photons and phonons ( we use the convention @xmath63 throughout the paper ) .",
    "the slow variation in @xmath50 should be considered and then the equation should be fourier transformed in the time difference coordinates .",
    "this procedure leads to the qke @xmath64 from now on the `` bar '' over @xmath65 will be dropped , with the understanding that all time variables are in fact center of mass time variables .",
    "equation ( [ qke ] ) for photons and phonons includes a factor of @xmath66 that multiplies the time derivative on the left hand side .",
    "since we are interested in off - shell energies that are close to the on - shell energy , this factor can be taken to be one .    in order to obtain equations for @xmath67 and @xmath68 one",
    "has to substitute an expression for the retarded self energy function , in terms of the one particle green functions , into the definitions of @xmath27 and @xmath26 ( [ s - w - def ] ) .",
    "these equations are in fact the imaginary and the real parts of equation ( [ dyson - grte ] ) .",
    "this yields coupled , self - consistent equations for @xmath27 and @xmath26 , that are also @xmath69 dependent .",
    "it is important to stress that the occupation function depends on time explicitly , while the dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath26 on time is only through their dependence on @xmath69 .",
    "therefore in order to find @xmath69 one has to write a kinetic equation , that will include time evolution through time derivatives . the equations for the level shift and width will include their dependence on time only through the appearance of @xmath69 , and will not include time derivatives .",
    "if one uses the self - consistent - born approximation for the self energy functions , one finds that the equations obtained for @xmath70 , and @xmath68 could have been obtained easily by applying a few generalizations to the be for @xmath1 . in the transfer from the be to the qke the number of unknowns increases from one ( @xmath69 ) , to three ( @xmath71 and @xmath26 ) , therefore apart from the kinetic equation we require two more equations for the unknown functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , that appear in the equation for @xmath72 .",
    "we present here a recipe which allows one to go from the be for @xmath73 , to the qke for @xmath72 , and from the decay term in the boltzmann equation ( which is defined below ) to an equation for @xmath67 .",
    "an equation for @xmath68 can be obtained from the equation for @xmath67 using kramers - kronig relations .",
    "the be , in its most general form , can be written as @xmath74     2 \\pi    \\delta ( \\epsilon_{\\alpha } - \\epsilon_{\\beta } + \\epsilon_{\\gamma} ... )\\equiv s.\\ ] ] this equation describes the evolution in time of the occupation number of particles in state @xmath19 , due to interactions with particles in states @xmath75 , with matrix elements @xmath76 .",
    "different states can also mean different particles .",
    "the right hand side of the equation includes delta functions that are responsible for energy conservation .",
    "there are many cases in which it is convenient to think of the collision integral @xmath77 as composed of `` scattering in '' events and `` scattering out '' events : @xmath78 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ boltzmann ] ) is the scattering in term : it describes processes in which particles enter state @xmath19 due to the interaction with other particles .",
    "this term can be written as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 includes all the terms on the right hand side of the equation that do not multiply @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to @xmath80 as the `` generation '' term .",
    "the second term is the scattering out term : it describes processes in which particles leave state @xmath19 .",
    "this term is usually written as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the scattering _ out _ time from state @xmath19 .    in the context of the generalization of the be to a qke , it is more convenient to think of the collision integral @xmath77 as made up of `` generation '' and `` decay '' terms : @xmath83 , where the decay term @xmath84 includes all the terms containing @xmath1",
    ". thus @xmath85 is the total decay rate of particles in state @xmath19 .",
    "it is the _ total _ decay rate , and not only the scattering _ out _ rate , that is related to the retarded self energy @xcite .",
    "the general form for the decay rate @xmath86 , as it is deduced from equation ( [ boltzmann ] ) , is @xmath87    2 \\pi     \\delta ( \\epsilon_{\\alpha } - \\epsilon_{\\beta } + \\epsilon_{\\gamma} ... ).\\ ] ] in a d.c .",

    "multiply the entire right hand side by @xmath98 .    in order to obtain an equation for @xmath67",
    "one should apply the first three steps of the generalization rules for the right hand side of the equation , to the expression for @xmath86 ( [ decay ] ) .",
    "the qke can be written generally in the form @xmath99 the function @xmath100 contains all the terms on the right hand side of the qke , that do not multiply @xmath72 .",
    "it is the generating term - the term in the kinetic equation that is responsible for the particle generation rate .",

    "note that due to ( [ norm ] ) the integration of equation ( [ qke - gg ] ) over @xmath51 results in the disappearance of the @xmath101 factor from the left hand side .",
