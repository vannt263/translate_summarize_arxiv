    "electron - electron correlation in strong laser fields has attracted a great deal of attention for over a decade , in particular in the context of laser - induced nonsequential double and multiple ionization @xcite . for these specific phenomena ,",
    "the electron - electron interaction plays a huge role . a concrete example are the peaks in the electron momentum distributions in nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , as functions of the electron components @xmath3 parallel to the laser - field polarization @xcite .",
    "such peaks occur at nonvanishing parallel momenta and can not be explained by a sequential mechanism .",
    "whilst it is agreed upon that nsdi owes its existence to the inelastic recollision of an electron with its parent ion , there exist several open questions related to this recollision , such as the combined effect of the residual ionic potential , the electron - electron interaction and the strong laser fields on the electron - momentum distributions fslb2004,beijing2008,eremina2004,misha2008,sachaeckh2008 .    for instance",
    ", it can happen that the first electron , upon return , provides the second electron with enough energy so that it is able to overcome the binding energy of the singly ionized ion and reach the continuum . in this case , the second electron is released by electron - impact ionization .",
    "both electrons leave simultaneously and lead to distributions peaked at nonvanishing momenta , in the first and third quadrant of the plane @xmath4 spanned by the parallel momentum components .",
    "this particular rescattering mechanism has been extensively investigated in the past few years , possibly for the following reasons .",
    "first , it explained the dramatic features observed experimentally in the electron momentum distributions , namely the peaks near the non - vanishing momenta @xmath5 @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ponderomotive energy , and the v - shaped structure observed in the electron momentum distributions , which is a signature of the long - range character of the electron - electron interaction fslb2004,beijing2008,misha2008,sachaeckh2008 .",
    "second , especially in the context of semi - analytic methods such as the strong - field approximation , electron - impact ionization is easier to model than the other rescattering mechanisms .    in the past few years , however , there has been increasing interest in below - threshold intensities , for which the kinetic energy of the recolliding electron is not sufficient to release a second electron by electron - impact ionization @xcite . in the below - threshold regime , the second electron is promoted to an excited bound state , from which it subsequently tunnels .",
    "this mechanism is known as the recollision - excitation - tunneling ionization ( resi ) .",
    "thereby , there is a time delay between the ionization of the first and second electrons .",
    "while the first electron will rescatter near a crossing of the driving field , the second electron is expected to leave a quarter of a cycle later , i.e. , near a field maximum . since in this case",
    "both electrons are expected to reach the detector with opposite momenta , one anticipates that the second and fourth quadrant of the plane @xmath8 will be populated .",
    "apart from the below - threshold scenario , resi is also present to a great extent in species such as argon and helium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments and computations involving aligned molecules suggest that resi plays an important role in this case nsdialign , sachaeck , chineseguys , baier .    up to the present moment",
    ", however , there have been relatively few studies of this specific physical mechanism , mainly in the context of classical or semiclassical methods @xcite . indeed , in many studies of nsdi below the threshold , electron - impact ionization has been considered instead , either in the framework of the strong - field coulomb eikonal approximation @xcite , or in the context of a classical model with a modified second ionization threshold @xcite .    in this paper , we model this physical mechanism within the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) . in this specific framework , the pertaining transition amplitude is written in terms of a semiclassical action and slowly varying prefactors . employing saddle - point methods",
    ", it is possible to relate the solutions of the saddle - point equations to the classical trajectories of an electron rescattering with its parent ion and , yet , retain quantum mechanical features such as interference or excitation .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ transampl ] , we will give the sfa transition amplitude for the resi mechanism , which will be solved by saddle - point methods .",
    "the saddle - point equations obtained will then be analyzed in detail , and , subsequently ( sec . [ classicalregion ] ) , we will provide momentum constraints for the first and second electron . in sec .",
    "results , these constraints will then be tested against the electron momentum distributions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we will conclude the paper with a few summarizing remarks .",

    "physically , however , we should guarantee that @xmath82    unless stated otherwise , we consider momentum distributions for which the perpendicular momentum components @xmath83 are integrated over . in the following , we will discuss which momentum regions such distributions will occupy , and the physical reasons behind it .",
    "from the saddle - point equations in the previous section , one may determine constraints for the parallel momentum components @xmath84 in the plane @xmath85 .",

    "an electron tunnels from a bound state and reaches the detector without rescattering with its parent ion .",
    "physically , this is exactly the situation encountered for the second electron , and will have two main consequences .",
    "firstly , the solutions of the saddle - point equations will be identical to those for the direct ati electrons @xcite .",
    "for vanishing electron drift momenta , these solutions are displaced by half a cycle , and are located at a maximum of the field . as the momentum increases , the solutions approach each other and move away from the maximum .",
    "secondly , the maximal kinetic energy for the direct ati electrons is @xmath88 hence , if the perpendicular components vanish , we will have an upper and lower bound for @xmath89 explicitly , @xmath90 one should note that this in contrast to the situation discussed in our previous papers fslb2004,fsly2008 , in which the second electron is dislodged by electron - impact ionization . in this latter case , @xmath91 is the _ most probable _ momentum @xmath92 with which the second electron may leave , whereas , in the present scenario , this is the _ maximum _ value for this quantity . for nonvanishing transverse momenta",
    ", this region will remain the same .",
    "we expect , however , that there will be a large drop in the yield .",
    "this is due to the fact that there will be an effective increase in the potential barrier through which the electron tunnels .",
    "this can be readily verified by writing the saddle - point equation ( [ saddle4 ] ) as@xmath93^{2}=-2\\tilde{e}_{2e},\\]]with @xmath94 .     for the second electron , as functions of its parallel momentum @xmath95 for a monochromatic field of intensity @xmath96 and frequency @xmath97 a.u , for several transverse momenta @xmath98 .",
    "the upper and lower panel give the real and imaginary parts of such times , respectively .",
    "we consider that the second electron is promoted to the @xmath99 state of the helium atom , from which it subsequently tunnels , i.e. , @xmath100 a.u . and @xmath101 a.u.,width=321 ]    in fig .",

    "as the transverse momentum @xmath104 becomes larger in absolute value , we see an increase in im@xmath78 $ ] .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the potential barrier widens in this case .",
    "( [ saddle3 ] ) , on the other hand , has a similar form as the saddle - point equation describing the rescattered electrons in ati fsb2002 , apart from the energy difference @xmath105 on the right - hand side .",
    "physically , this is somehow expected , as in both cases the first electron leaves immediately after rescattering .",
    "the difference is that , while in ati the rescattering is elastic , in nsdi part of the electron s kinetic energy is used to excite the core . for ati , the maximal energy with which",
    "the electron rescatters is @xmath106 and corresponds to backscattered electrons .",

    "we consider the shortest orbits for the returning electron .",
    "the remaining sets of orbits are strongly suppressed due to wave - packet spreading . by associating the real parts of @xmath122 and @xmath28 with the classical trajectories of an electron in a laser field ,",
    "one may identify a longer and a shorter orbit , along which the first electron returns .",
    "these orbits practically coalesce for two specific values of @xmath123 namely the minimum and the maximum momenta for which the rescattering process described by the saddle - point equation ( [ saddle3 ] ) has a classical counterpart . beyond these momenta",
    ", the yield decays exponentially . for vanishing transverse momentum @xmath124 these cutoffs are near @xmath125 and @xmath126 , as predicted by our estimates .",
    "as @xmath127 increases , the classically allowed region shrinks and gets very localized near @xmath128 for the parameters considered here , this corresponds to the situation in which the electron returns at a crossing of the field . finally , for very large transverse momenta , this region disappears .",
    "the imaginary parts of the times @xmath129 and @xmath28 , displayed in figs .",
    "[ timesfirst].(b ) and [ timesfirst].(d ) , confirm this physical interpretation .",
    "in fact , they show that , for the rescattering times , im[@xmath28 ] essentially vanishes between the momenta for which the real parts re[@xmath28 ] coalesce . physically , this means that , in this region , rescattering is classically allowed . beyond this region , im[@xmath28 ] increases abruptly , which indicates that the classically forbidden region has been reached .  in this context , it is worth mentioning that , even if there is no classically allowed region , im[@xmath131 exhibits a minimum near @xmath132 .",

    "the circles indicate the expected maxima of the electron momentum distributions .",
    "the blue and red colors indicate different sets of trajectories , whose start and recollision times are separated by half a cycle of the field . in our estimates , we considered vanishing transverse momenta , so that the constraints provided constitute an upper bound for this region .",
    "the above plot has not been symmetrized with respect to the indistinguishability of the two electrons.,width=340 ]    the imaginary part im[@xmath43 ] of the start time of the first electron , on the other hand , is always non - vanishing .",
    "this is not surprising , as tunneling has no classical counterpart .",
    "they are , however , approximately constant between the lower and upper cutoff momenta .    by solving the saddle - point eqs .",
    "( [ saddle3 ] ) and ( [ saddle4 ] ) , we verified that , if we consider the physically relevant parameters , namely that @xmath75 @xmath135 where @xmath136  denotes a laser - field cycle , then @xmath137 will be predominantly positive and @xmath138 will be predominantly negative .",
    "conversely , for the orbits whose start , rescattering and tunneling times are displaced by half a cycle , @xmath139 will be mainly negative and @xmath133 will be predominantly positive . therefore , one expects that the distributions will be mainly concentrated in the second and fourth quadrants of the parallel momentum plane .    in fig .",
    "[ constraintsp1p2 ] , we summarize the information discussed above , and provide a schematic representation of the momentum regions occupied in the resi process . in particular , we expect the distributions to exhibit maxima near the points @xmath140 in a real - life situation , since both electrons are indistinguishable , one would expect maxima also at @xmath141 .",

    "the distribution is longer in the @xmath133 direction .",
    "this is expected , as the cutoff momenta is higher in this case .",
    "finally , the distributions also exhibit a maximum at @xmath153 , in agreement with the above - defined constraints .",

    "these results show that the momentum regions populated by the resi mechanism are much lower than those populated if the second electron is released by electron - impact ionization , in agreement with other results reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion to be inferred from this work is that the recollision - excitation - ionization mechanism , which is becoming increasingly studied due to its importance for nsdi of molecules and at threshold intensities , can be understood as rescattered above - threshold ionization ( ati ) for the first electron , followed by direct ati for the second electron .",
    "the kinematic constraints imposed by both processes lead to cross - shaped electron momentum distributions , localized at the axis @xmath156 or @xmath157 , and centered at @xmath158 .",
    "the fact that these distributions are concentrated in the low momentum regions is not surprising .",
    "physically , much less energy is required to promote an electron to an excited state , from which it subsequently tunnels , than to provide the second electron with enough energy so that it may overcome the second ionization potential and reach the continuum , as in electron - impact ionization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since for the recollision - excitation - tunneling mechanism there is a time delay between the ionization of the first and second electron , the second and fourth quadrants of the plane spanned by the parallel momentum components @xmath159 are populated @xcite .",
