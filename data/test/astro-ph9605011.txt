    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are close binary systems which undergo large amplitude outbursts with a recurrence time of about @xmath1 years ( see e.g. white 1994 for a review ) . in most cases",
    "sxts disappear from the x - ray sky between outbursts leaving only the companion star observable as a dim optical source .",
    "most sxts are low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , that is , binary systems in which a neutron star or a black hole accretes matter lost by a roche - lobe filling low - mass stellar companion .",
    "a minority of sxts show x - ray bursts during decline from outburst ( e.g. koyama et al . 1981 ) and must contain neutron stars . in several other sxts , observations of the companion have allowed measurement of a mass function which is larger than the maximum mass of a neutron star ( orosz et al . 1994 ; casares & charles 1994 ; orosz et al .",
    "1995 ; casares , charles & marsh 1995 ; bailyn et al .",
    "these are certain to be black holes . for the remaining sxts",
    "there is no direct evidence on whether they have neutron stars or black holes , but it is believed that the majority of them contain accreting black holes ( see tanaka & lewin 1995 and van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "most of the outburst energy in an sxt is emitted in rather soft ( 1 to few kev ) x - rays .",
    "it has been claimed that the spectra of black  hole sxts ( bsxts ) are characterised in outburst by an ` ultra  soft ' ( white et al . 1984 ) component , and that this is not seen in neutron star sxts .",
    "however , in a few cases involving good black hole candidates ( e.g. v404 cyg ) such a component has not been observed ( harmon et al .",
    "at least one black hole sxt was observed to emit very high energy photons , namely nova muscae 1991 which had an e@xmath2@xmath3 annihilation line ( goldwurm et al . 1993 ) . on the other hand some neutron star sxts",
    "have also been observed to emit above 100 kev ( barret et al .",
    "it is therefore not clear if there are any spectral characteristics that would allow , in general , to distinguish between neutron star and black hole transients .",
    "the binary periods of sxts generally lie in the range between 5 hours and 6 days .",
    "( the ` ultra - soft ' transient system 4u 1630 - 47 , [ parmar , angelini & white 1995 ] could be an exception if its period is confirmed to be 601.7@xmath4 days . )",
    "sxts are therefore lmxbs with main  sequence dwarf companions or , at longer periods , ( sub)giant companions ( king 1993 ) . as in the case of their close cousins , the dwarf novae , which have central white dwarfs instead of neutron stars or black holes , two kinds of models have been proposed to explain the outbursts of sxts .",
    "hameury , king & lasota ( 1986 ) proposed a model in which outburts are due entirely to a mass transfer instability in the x - ray illuminated regions of the mass - losing companion .",
    "it was shown , however , by gontikakis & hameury ( 1993 ) that the existence of sxts with orbital periods under @xmath5 h is a problem since the model is unable to produce the observed short ( @xmath6 s ) timescales ( see also lasota 1995 ) .",
    "the dwarf nova disk instability model ( dim ) ( see e.g. cannizzo 1993 ) has been extended to the case of bsxts by huang & wheeler ( 1989 ) and mineshige & wheeler ( 1989 ) .",
    "below we discuss problems and difficulties that this model encounters when confronted with observations .",
    "in addition to the above two proposals , one should also consider models in which the two mechanisms are at work in the same source .",
    "for example , the disk instabilty could be triggered by an enhanced mass transfer ( emt ) .",
    "such  mixed \" or `` hybrid '' models have been proposed for the superoutbursts of su uma type dwarf novae ( duschl & livio 1989 ; smak 1995,1996 ; lasota , hameury & hur 1995 ) and suggested as a possible explanation of sxt outbursts ( lasota 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyse how various versions of the disk instabilty model could be applied to outbursts of bsxts . in section 2",
    "we discuss the difficulties of the dwarf nova dim when it is applied to bsxts .",
    "section 3 gives a short review of the advection - dominated flow model of quiescent bsxts ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ) . in section 4.1",
    "we show that the ` hybrid ' emt - triggered dim could apply to bsxts . in section 4.2",
    "we show that the outer cold disk in bsxts could be globally unstable and so bsxt outbursts could be triggered by a thermal disk instability , as proposed independently by mineshige ( 1995 ) .",
    "we discuss problems and difficulties in section 5 and present conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the dim is based on the fact that accretion disk equilibria are unstable at effective temperatures in the range @xmath7 k , depending on the radial distance from the center .",
    "it is conventional to discuss the instability in the @xmath8 plane , where @xmath9 is the surface density of the disk and @xmath10 is the effective temperature . at a given radius , disk equilibria trace a characteristic ` @xmath11 ' shaped curve on this plane , as indicated by the example shown in figure  1 ( based on [ hameury , hur & lasota 1995 ] ) .",
    "the middle branch of the s ( shown by a dotted line ) represents thermally and viscously unstable equilibria and can not represent physically accessible states .",
    "therefore , locally , an accretion flow has to choose between the two stable branches of the s ( solid lines ) , either the upper ` hot ' branch or the lower ` cold ' branch .",
    "the upper branch exists only above a minimum surface density @xmath12 and minimum mass accretion rate @xmath13 , where the value of @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath12 , while the lower branch exists only below a certain @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that the limiting surface densities and accretion rates vary with the radius @xmath16 .",
    "if the steady mass transfer rate @xmath17 supplied by the secondary star corresponds to conditions in the unstable middle branch , i.e. if @xmath18 , then the disk can not maintain a steady state configuration and is forced into a local ` limit cycle ' behaviour , alternating between the cold and hot branches . a dwarf nova outburst or sxt outburst",
    "would then correspond to the transition from the cold to the hot state .",
    "observations indicate that dwarf nova and sxt outbursts are global events where the entire disk makes the transition . in order to produce such a global outburst ,",
    "it is required that the pre - outburst quiescent disk be entirely on the lower branch at all radii @xmath16 , i.e. we must have @xmath19 at all @xmath16 .",
    "= 8.2 cm    in general , the critical density of the cold branch can be represented as ( smak 1993 ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass of the central object , @xmath0 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter of the thin disk , and the index @xmath22 so that @xmath14 is an increasing function of @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath23 exponent is usually negative , @xmath24 .    in a disk around a black hole in a binary system",
    "the radius may vary by 5 to 6 orders of magnitude so that eq .",
    "( [ e2.1 ] ) would imply very low densities in the quiescent inner disk .",
    "for example , introducing numerical values in eq .",
    "( [ e2.1 ] ) according to the formula given by smak ( 1993 ) , we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the scaled radius in units of the schwarzschild radius @xmath27 , and the mass is scaled according to @xmath28 .    according to the dim ,",
    "the quiescent disk in a dwarf nova or sxt system is not in global equilibrium . instead , the local accretion rate increases with distance from the center ( see eq .",
    "( [ e2.5 ] ) and the effective temperature is constant with radius ( see eq .",
    "( [ e5.2 ] ) .",
    "this last property is confirmed by observations ( e.g. wood et al .",
    "1986 ; 1989 ) . assuming that outbursts begin near the inner disk edge and taking @xmath29 , smak ( 1993 ) obtains for the recurrence time @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radius of the inner edge of the disk and @xmath32 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient . in most",
    "bsxts the recurrence time is longer than @xmath5 yr .",
    "therefore , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) a condition on the viscosity coefficient : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the recurrence time in units of @xmath35 s. combining eq .",
    "( [ e2.2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ e2.4 ] ) , we then obtain the following inequality which has to be satisfied by the accretion rate at the inner edge of a quiescent disk if the dim is correct ( lasota 1995 ) : @xmath36 the dim of mineshige & wheeler ( 1989 ; mw ) satisfies this inequality .",
    "( [ e2.5 ] ) provides an observational test of the dim .",
    "several bsxts have been observed by ginga ( mineshige 1992 ) and rosat ( see verbunt 1995 ) , and two systems , a0620 - 00 and v404 cyg , have been detected at levels corresponding to accretion rates ( assuming an efficiency of 0.1 , see below ) of at least @xmath37  g  s@xmath38 for a0620 - 00 and @xmath39  g  s@xmath38 for v404 cyg ( mineshige 1992 ; mcclintock , horne & remillard 1995 ; verbunt 1995 ) .",
    "for reasonable values of @xmath40 , these accretion rates are several orders of magnitude larger than the values implied by eq .",
    "( [ e2.5 ] ) for @xmath41 ( inner edge at the last stable orbit as in the dwarf  nova type model ) .",
    "therefore , the detections of x - ray radiation from quiescent sxts contradict the disk instability model , at least in the version proposed by mw ( mineshige 1992 ) .",
    "we note that in the case of a062000 , the prototypical bsxt , the optical luminosity suggests a mass accretion rate of @xmath42  g  s@xmath38 in the outer part of the accretion disc ( mcclintock et al .",
    "1995 ) , at @xmath43 .",
    "the observation of x - ray emission in quiescent sxts at low luminosities poses an insurmountable obstacle to models in which the accretion disk is of the shakura  sunyaev type with @xmath41 . on the one hand , the requirement of eq .",
    "( [ e2.5 ] ) ) can be reconciled with the deduced mass accretion rate of @xmath44 only if we assume a very low viscosity in the inner disk , e.g. @xmath45 which is almost equivalent to having no viscosity at all .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath46 . according to the dim ( see e.g. cannizzo et al .",
    "1995 ) @xmath23 should be of the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the disk semi - thickness .",
    "cannizzo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the values of @xmath23 they obtain are well in excess of those required by eq .",
    "( [ e2.5 ] ) confirming the failure of the dim to account for the observed properties of quiescent sxts . on the other hand , the x ",
    "rays have to be produced by a process connected to viscosity , and if we assume a standard thin disk with @xmath51 as implied by the x - ray observations , the effective temperature will be so low that the disk will radiate hardly any x - rays at all . in other words ,",
    "the required value of @xmath23 in the dwarf  nova type model is unreasonable , and even if we ignore this problem , it is impossible to fit both the low luminosity and the temperature of the radiation simultaneously .",
    "the advection - dominated model of narayan , mcclinotck & yi ( 1996 ) ( hereafter nmy ) presents a solution to this problem .",
    "the fundamental property of advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) is that the efficiency with which energy is radiated is very low , so that most of the heat released by viscous friction ( or other processes ) is advected into the central black hole and only an almost infinitesimal amount is radiated away .",
    "models of adafs were first constructed for optically thick flows with angular momentum ( begelman 1979 ; begelman & meier 1982 ; abramowicz et al . 1986 , 1988 ) .",
    "the models correspond to very high ( super - eddington ) accretion rates and have not yet found an application to real astrophysical objects .",
    "as pointed out by narayan and popham ( 1993 ) , advection may play an important role also in the case of optically thin flows which are notoriously non - efficient radiators . in this case , the viscously heated gas flows into the black hole on a shorter timescale than its cooling time and therefore a large fraction of the energy is advected rather than radiated .",
    "models of optically thin advection - dominated flows were constructed in a series of papers by narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995a , b ) and abramowicz et al ( 1995 ) , chen ( 1995 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the narayan & yi ( 1995b ) version of the adaf model deals with a two - temperature plasma which is radiatively cooled by bremsstrahlung , synchrotron emission and comptonization .",
    "this model was first successfully applied to the galactic center source sgr a@xmath52 ( narayan , yi & mahadevan 1995 ) , and soon after applied to quiescent sxts ( nmy ) .",
    "recently the narayan & yi ( 1995b ) model was applied to the dwarf active galactic nucleus ngc 4258 ( lasota et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the accretion flow in the nmy model consists of two parts : outside some radius @xmath53 the accreting gas takes the form of a standard , cold , geometrically thin , keplerian disk .",
    "however , inside @xmath53 , the accretion proceeds in the form of an adaf . here",
    ", the gas becomes extremely hot , with the ions reaching temperatures @xmath54 k and the electrons going up to @xmath55 k. the very high ion temperature causes the gas to be very thick in the vertical direction ; indeed , the flow is essentially quasi - spherical rather than disk - like , though it is still partially supported by rotation . for simplicity , nmy assumed that the accretion rate is constant throughout the whole flow .    in the nmy model",
    ", the optical and uv radiation is produced by the outer thin disk , while the inner advection - dominated flow , because of its very high temperature , produces all the hard radiation in x - rays and soft @xmath56-rays . even though the same @xmath57 flows through the outer and inner zones , the model quite naturally explains the low luminosity of the x - rays as a consequence of the extremely low radiative efficiency of the adaf .",
    "the viscous energy dissipation in the adaf is significantly larger than that in the outer thin disk since most of the gravitational potential energy is released in the adaf .",
    "however , virtually all of this energy is advected into the black hole and only a very tiny fraction is radiated .",
    "this effect is so strong that the luminosity of the adaf is actually less than that of the outer disk .",
    "nmy used their model to fit the spectra of three quiescent bsxts : a6020 - 00 , v 404 cyg and x - ray nova muscae 1991 .",
    "the fits to the observed optical ",
    "uv to x - ray spectra of the three sxts are very good .",
    "the models depend basically on two parameters , @xmath58 ( where @xmath23 refers to the viscosity parameter in the adaf and is distinct from @xmath0 of the outer thin disk ) and @xmath53 .",
    "the other parameters are either given directly by observations ( for example the black hole mass ) or the fits turn out to be insensitive to their values ( for example the ratio of the gas to the total pressure ) .",
    "the presence of an inner hot advection - dominated flow removes the contradiction between the observed x - ray emission and the properties of a shakura - sunyaev type disk .",
    "there remains the question of why bsxts go into outbursts .",
    "could the mechanism be related to the hot inner flow ?",
    "abramowicz et al ( 1995 ) and narayan & yi ( 1995b ) showed that there is a maximum accretion rate above which there are no optically thin advection - dominated solutions . in the narayan & yi model the critical accretion rate is @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "figure  2 , taken from narayan ( 1995 ) and based on chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , represents the structure of all possible accretion solutions for the case of a 10 @xmath63 black hole .",
    "label 1 refers to a region where the only allowed solution is an advection - dominated one , label 2 refers to a radiatively - cooled zone , and label 3 corresponds to a region where both types of solutions are allowed . in region 4",
    "there are no stable solutions at all .",
    "one could speculate that if the accretion rate at which matter is brought to the hot adaf corresponded to region 4 , the system would be forced into a thermal runaway and a limit cycle ( see e.g. chen et al .",
    "there is , however , a problem with this scenario .",
    "nmy found that they needed @xmath64 in the advection - dominated inner zone of their models .",
    "for such @xmath23 , zone 4 exists only for mass accretion rates above @xmath65 .",
    "but the mass transfer rates in quiescent sxts estimated by nmy correspond to @xmath66 .",
    "for such low accretion rates an adaf solution is always present . furthermore , adafs are thermally stable by construction ( abramowicz et al . 1995 , narayan & yi 1995b , kato et al .",
    "1995 ) the hot inner flows in quiescent sxts are therefore stable and we can not expect to find there the cause of outbursts .",
    "thus the outburst mechanism in sxts must be associated with the outer cold disk which could be , or become thermally unstable .",
    "below we will investigate the mechanisms that could cause an outburst in the outer thin disk .      in this and the next sections we will study the stability properties of the outer ` standard ' thin disk , which extends from the transition radius @xmath67 to the outer radius @xmath68 .",
    "as explained in section 2 , for the disk to be globally unstable , the mass transfer rate @xmath17 must satisfy at some radius the inequality @xmath69 where @xmath15 and @xmath70 are defined in section 2 .",
    "the range of unstable mass transfer rates depends on the size of the disk . as an example figure  3 shows surface density profiles of equilibrium accretion disks around a @xmath71 black hole , where the disk has been truncated at @xmath67 in accordance with the nmy model .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath57 is constant for each curve .",
    "the unstable part of the curve is represented by a dotted line , the cold stable configurations correspond to the solid line .",
    "models by hameury et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were used in this calculation with a thin disk viscosity parameter @xmath72 . note that this is smaller than the value @xmath64 which nmy found was necessary for a consistent model of the advection - dominated region .",
    "there is no contradiction in this since there is no reason for @xmath23 to be the same in the advection  dominated and standard regions ; one should rather expect @xmath23 to be lower in the outer thin disk compared to the inner hot flow .",
    "a globally stable , cold accretion disk can not be represented by a curve that crosses the @xmath73 line .",
    "assuming @xmath74 at @xmath68 , we can have a situation where with decreasing @xmath75 , we reach the condition @xmath76 at some radius @xmath77",
    ". the disk can be in cold equilibrium only for @xmath78 .",
    "continuing to @xmath79 , the segment of the curve between @xmath14 and @xmath12 is unstable while the curve to the left of @xmath12 represents hot equilibria .",
    "for each mass transfer rate @xmath17 , there exists therefore a critical radius @xmath80 outside of which the disk is globally stable in the cold state . from figure",
    "3 we can see that the global state of the disk will depend on the exact value of @xmath53 relative to @xmath80 .",
    "for example , for @xmath81 , if the outer disk is truncated at @xmath82 we have a globally stable disk whereas if @xmath83 the disk is globally unstable . for the moment we consider @xmath53 to be a free parameter that is fixed by best ` fit ' to the spectrum of the quiescent sxt in combination with other parameters such as the black hole mass , @xmath23 etc .",
    "( see nmy ) .",
    "physically , of course , the value of @xmath53 should be determined by the process that leads to the formation of the adaf , such as coronal evaporation ( see e.g. meyer & meyer ",
    "hofmeister 1994 ) or heating by diffusive energy transport ( honma 1995 ) .",
    "the theories of these processes have not yet developed to the point where they can make robust predictions of @xmath53 .",
    "lasota ( 1995 ) studied a similar problem in the context of dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "some su uma  type dwarf novae show only very rare and very long superoutbursts and no ( or almost no ) ` normal ' outbursts .",
    "the best known system in this class is wz sge .",
    "such dn systems are the closest relatives of bsxts .",
    "the dim applied to dwarf novae requires some modifications before it can be applied to the whole class of observed events . in particular , the so  called uv  delay problem and the x  ray and",
    "uv emissions from quiescent dns require a ` hole ' in the inner disk regions ( see e.g. meyer & meyer ",
    "hofmeister 1994 ) .",
    "this ` hole ' can be produced by magnetic disruption if the white dwarf is ( weakly ) magnetized ( livio & pringle 1992 ) or it can be the result of evaporation ( meyer & meyer ",
    "hofmeister 1994 ) .",
    "lasota ( 1995 ) show that if the inner regions of accretion disks in quiescent dwarf nova systems are removed , the remaining disk is globally stable for mass transfer rates @xmath84 g s@xmath38 .",
    "this implies that ( super)outbursts in such systems have to be triggered by an enhanced mass transfer from the companion .",
    "they suggest that the lack of normal outbursts in wz sge results because of its low mass transfer rate : there are no outbursts because the disk is stable .",
    "a superoutburst would be triggered by an emt which would put the disk into a globally unstable state ; in other words , superoutbursts would be due to a disk instability generated by an increased mass transfer .",
    "observations show that the mass transfer increases prior to and during the superoutburst so that such a hybrid mechanism could be at work in su uma s ( smak 1995 , 1996 ) . the alternative model ( see osaki 1996 for a review ) in which superoutbursts are due to a pure disk instablity , the so  called tidal ",
    "thermal instability , is yet to be confirmed by the observational properties of su uma ( smak 1991 ) and requires the viscosity to be extremely low in the case of wz sge .",
    "if @xmath53 in ( some ) bsxts is such that in quiescence the outer thin disk is globally stable the same reasoning would apply also to these systems and ( some ) sxt outbursts could be due to an emt triggered disk instability .",
    "if , for a given mass transfer rate , the inner radius of the outer thin accretion disk @xmath53 is smaller than the critical radius @xmath85 , the disk will be globally unstable and will undergo dn type outbursts .",
    "we show in this section that we obtain reasonable recurrence times without any unusual assumption about the value of the viscosity parameter @xmath0 .    in order to estimate properties of the outbursts we closely follow the steps used by smak ( 1993 ) in the analysis of wz sge .    as discussed in section 2 .",
    ", the disk outburst begins when the density exceeds somewhere the critical value @xmath14 .",
    "the type of resulting outburst depends on where in the disk this happens . for a constant @xmath17 ,",
    "the type of outburst depends on two characteristic times : the time @xmath86 it takes the matter accumulating at the outer disk to build up a surface density larger than @xmath14 , and the viscous time @xmath87 which measures the time it takes matter to diffuse inward and cross the @xmath14 barrier somewhere nearer to the inner disk boundary .",
    "if @xmath88 one obtains a so - called  outside - in \" ( ` type a ' ) outburst beginning at the outer disk edge ; in the opposite case one has an  inside - out \" ( type b ) outburst ( smak 1984 ) .",
    "below , we will consider  inside - out \" outbursts .",
    "as discussed by smak ( 1993 ) these outbursts have longer recurrence times ( longer length of the outburst cycle ) than the `` outside in '' outbursts and give also upper limits on @xmath0 .",
    "one should note here that although there are cases where it is claimed that bsxt outbursts began in the inner regions ( chen et al .",
    "1993 ) , the observational evidence is far from being conclusive .",
    "one should note however that the present discussion concerns the _",
    "outer _ thin disk so that even an  inside - out \" outburst in the outer disk would most probably be an ",
    "outside - in \" outburst from the point of view of the inner , hot accretion flow .",
    "rescaling eq .",
    "( [ e2.5 ] ) to the characteristic parameters of the outer disk we get @xmath89 as before , @xmath0 denotes the viscosity parameter in the thin disk .",
    "if we replace @xmath57 by the luminosity of the thin disk : @xmath90 the recurrence time of the instability can be written as @xmath91 eq . ( [ e4.5 ] ) reveals the severe problem faced by the dwarf - nova type disk instability model of sxts and how the problem is resolved in the nmy two - zone model . if we set the inner edge of the thin disk to be @xmath92 , corresponding to the last stable orbit , then for the observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( [ e4.5 ] ) shows that we need an absurdly small @xmath94 . on the other hand , if we set @xmath95 as found by nmy from their spectral fits , then we obtain the right recurrence timescale with @xmath96 , consistent with the values of @xmath0 required by the ` standard ' dim for dwarf novae ( livio & spruit 1991 ) .",
    "however , our estimated value of @xmath0 is very sensitive to the values of @xmath53 and @xmath97 , so that the values @xmath98 , @xmath53 and @xmath97 can not be much different from those assumed in eq .",
    "( [ e4.5 ] ) for @xmath0 to be not much smaller than @xmath99 . in the case of a0620 - 00 the optical luminosity is @xmath100 ( mcclintock et al .",
    "1995 ) so that if one wished to keep @xmath101 , eq .",
    "( [ e4.5 ] ) requires @xmath102 . at @xmath103",
    "this optical luminosity corresponds to an accretion rate @xmath104 .",
    "3 shows however that for @xmath102 the outer disk is globally stable so that eq .",
    "( [ e4.5 ] ) does not apply because to go into outburst the system requires an emt . on the other hand ,",
    "if we allowed the value of @xmath0 to be as low as @xmath105 , which is required for the pure dim to work in the case of wz sge ( smak 1993 ) , the transition radius could be @xmath106 depending on the value of the black hole mass .",
    "we thus conclude that bsxt outbursts can be triggered by the ` normal ' dwarf nova type instability in the outer cold , keplerian disk .",
    "the critical factor which allows us to obtain good agreement on the recurrence time with a `` reasonable '' value of @xmath0 is the truncation of the thin disk at a large radius @xmath53 . since such values of @xmath102",
    "are also required by the emt model , this could be viewed as an independent confirmation of the truncated disk model of nmy .",
    "another feature of the nmy model is that it provides a natural explanation for the spectral evolution seen in sxts during outburst ( narayan 1996 ) .",
    "when the outer disk goes into outburst and the mass accretion rate increases suddenly , the first response of the system will be for the @xmath57 in the inner advection - dominated zone also to increase proportionately . since the luminosity of the inner zone varies roughly as @xmath107 , the x - ray luminosity will go up enormously . at the same time , since the electron temperature is very high , the spectrum will remain hard and there will be emission out to a few @xmath108 kev .",
    "model calculations indicate that the photon spectral index is expected to be @xmath109 ( narayan 1996 ) when the luminosity reaches @xmath110 .",
    "meanwhile , the increased @xmath57 will probably cause the outer thin disk to diffuse inward on a viscous time .",
    "therefore , after some delay , the outer thin disk will move into the advection - dominated zone , perhaps extending all the way into the black hole .",
    "when this happens , we will have a very luminous soft x - ray source with a spectrum consistent with that of a shakura - sunyaev disk . a0620 - 00 and nova muscae 1991 appear to have made this transition , whereas v404 cyg remained a hard source throughout the outburst .",
    "perhaps the thin disk did not penetrate all the way to the center in the latter case . as the outburst dies down , we expect these stages to occur in reverse .",
    "first , the thin disk will shrink back , leaving behind a strong hard x - ray source .",
    "later , as @xmath57 reduces , the system will revert to the quiescent state where there will be a very low x - ray luminosity and most of the viscous energy will be advected into the black hole .",
    "the stages described above , which appear reasonable under the advection - dominated model , match quite well with observations of several sxts in outburst .",
    "the nmy model gives a satisfactory description of the quiescent state of bsxts , and as we have shown in this paper also provides a reasonable explanation of the recurrence times of the outbursts and the spectral evolution during outburst .",
    "all of these were difficult to explain with the previous model where the thin disk was assumed to extend all the way down to the black hole .",
    "there is , however , an inconsistency in the nmy model . the spectral ` fits ' are made under the assumption that the outer disk is stationary , which means in practice , that a temperature profile @xmath111 is used to calculate the spectrum .",
    "for the parameters required for an acceptable spectral fit , the assumed values of @xmath112 , @xmath23 and @xmath53 are such that @xmath113 so that a stationary disk is globally unstable .",
    "such a disk would therefore be subject to the dwarf - nova type instability , which means that in the quiescent state the accretion rate would not be constant with radius .",
    "this implies a self - inconsistency in the nmy model .",
    "a further problem arises from the @xmath10 required to fit the optical spectra .",
    "taking for the effective temperature ( cf .",
    "frank et al . 1992 ) @xmath114^{1/4 } , \\label{e5.1}\\ ] ] and replacing @xmath57 by the expression given in eq .",
    "( [ e4.3 ] ) we see that @xmath115 which shows that the effective temperature in a quiescent dwarf nova disk is practically independent of the radius . for @xmath116 and a recurrence time @xmath117 60 days ,",
    "typical parameters of a dwarf nova , eq .",
    "( [ e5.2 ] ) gives ( for @xmath118 ) @xmath119 , very close to the observed values ( wood et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "the problem arises when we apply the same formula to quiescent sxts . for sxt parameters ,",
    "the effective temperature turns out to be @xmath120 k which is too low to agree with observations .",
    "both in a0620 - 00 and v404 cyg , the optical and uv data imply significantly higher temperatures .",
    "it should be emphasized that this problem is not peculiar to the nmy model , but will be faced by any sxt model which invokes a dwarf nova type non - steady quiescent accretion disk .    a possible explanation for the higher disk temperature could be that the outer disk is optically thin .",
    "the strong h@xmath23 line in the spectra of these disks suggests that a substantial part of the emission comes from optically thin gas .",
    "it is then natural for the color temperature to be higher than the effective temperature .",
    "finally , one should note that the failure of the dim to account for the properties of quiescent sxts has been also noticed by cannizzo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and kim et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who suggested ` non - standard ' inner disk structures that do not invoke advection .",
    "the detailed mechanism by which bsxts go into outburst will depend on the values of @xmath57 , @xmath23 and @xmath121 .",
    "these parameters , or rather the ratio @xmath58 and @xmath121 , are the free parameters which nmy used to fit their models to observed spectra of quiescent sxts .",
    "the physical conditions in the outer disk are very similar to those that are encountered in accretion disks of su uma systems .",
    "for this reason also the problems with the origin of the outbursts ( or rather superoutbursts ) are the same .    at the low accretion rates that are required by observations of bsxts in quiescensce",
    ", the accretion disk may be globally stable for @xmath122 . in this case only an increase in the mass transfer from the secondary can bring the disk into an unstable state and trigger the outburst . to make the model complete",
    "one should find why the secondary increases its transfer rate on timescales typical of sxts .",
    "one should note however that variations of the transfer rate on various timescales _ are observed _ in many close binary systems .",
    "when @xmath57 , @xmath23 and @xmath121 correspond to a globally unstable outer disk configuration , a dn type instability will necessarily occur .",
    "the effect of the outburst on the inner hot adaf should be similar to that of a emt triggered outburst since both types of outbursts are basically due to the same thermal instability .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the disk instability model works much better for sxts if the thin disk is truncated at a large transition radius @xmath53 as in the nmy model rather than having the disk extending down to @xmath123 as in the model by mineshige & wheeler ( 1989 ) .",
    "the region inside the radius of truncation would then be filled with a very hot , optically thin , ultra - low radiative efficiency , advection - dominated flow .",
    "nmy showed that such a model gives a good fit to the spectra of quiescent sxts , while narayan ( 1996 ) suggested that it may be consistent with the spectral evolution observed in sxts during outburst . in this paper , we show that the recurrence times of sxt outbursts are satisfactorily predicted with a reasonable value of the viscosity parameter @xmath96 in the outer disk ( or @xmath124 in the worst case ) .",
    "in contrast , in the dwarf  nova type model , one requires an implausibly low value @xmath94 .",
    "one interesting point to bear in mind is that it is possible to have binaries where @xmath57 , @xmath23 and @xmath53 correspond to a globally stable outer disk in a cold low state , and where in addition the secondary star for whatever reason does not have any tendency to exhibit a large amplitude emt instability .",
    "in such a system , we would have a black hole binary which is permanently in the quiescent state , with most of the accretion energy being swallowed by the black hole .",
    "the system would be extremely dim in x - rays and quite under - luminous even in the optical and would be very hard to detect . in principle , the galaxy could have large numbers of such nearly silent black holes , which would be the binary equivalent of the underluminous galactic nuclei discussed by fabian & rees ( 1995 ) .",
