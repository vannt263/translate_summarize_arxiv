    "in the course of the last few years exclusive photo- and electroproduction of neutral vector mesons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath7 ) at intermediate and high energies has attained increased theoretical interest , which has been stimulated by corresponding experimental efforts at cebaf  @xcite and hera  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the hera experiments is a more fundamental understanding of pomeron phenomenology in terms of qcd .",
    "vector - meson dominance in combination with pomeron exchange proves to be very successful in describing diffractive photo- and electroproduction of neutral vector mesons , provided the energy is the only large scale in the process  @xcite . in their approach donnachie and landshoff",
    "@xcite assume that the pomeron couples directly to on - shell quarks in the vector meson and the proton , respectively .",
    "a qcd - inspired version of pomeron exchange , in which the pomeron is replaced by two non- perturbative ( abelian ) gluons , goes back to the same authors  @xcite and is usually termed a soft pomeron . in the limit @xmath8",
    "the soft - pomeron exchange becomes very similar to the usual pomeron exchange .",
    "this can be used to interpret the form factor at the quark - pomeron vertex  @xcite .",
    "however , if in addition to the energy another scale , like the photon virtuality or the mass of the vector meson , becomes large perturbative qcd effects tend to enter the game . for large photon virtuality ( and small values of mandelstam @xmath3 ) perturbative qcd becomes applicable due to a factorization theorem which has been proved in ref .",
    "the three building blocks of the factorization formula are the hard photon - parton scattering amplitude , the distribution amplitude of the vector meson and finally a skewed gluon distribution of the proton . as a link between hard inclusive and exclusive reactions which generalizes the ordinary parton distributions ,",
    "skewed parton distributions have recently attracted a great amount of interest ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "electroproduction with highly virtual photons thus offers a possibility to study such skewed parton distributions . within this perturbative formalism for vector - meson electroproduction with highly virtual photons",
    "the two - gluon aspect of the pomeron emerges automatically in a form which is related to the skewed gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "one of the aims of photoproduction experiments at cebaf is , on the other hand , to understand the transition from non - perturbative to perturbative production mechanisms . in the case of photoproduction",
    "the transverse momentum transfer @xmath9 has to be large in order that perturbative qcd becomes applicable .",
    "the pertinent factorization formula , which in general holds for arbitrary exclusive hadronic processes at large transverse momenta , is the result of a leading - order perturbative analysis .",
    "it represents a hadronic amplitude as a convolution integral of a hard - scattering amplitude with distribution amplitudes ( das )  @xcite .",
    "the process - dependent hard - scattering amplitude is perturbatively calculable and represents the scattering of hadronic constituents in collinear approximation .",
    "the process- independent das contain the non - perturbative bound - state dynamics of the hadronic constituents .",
    "there is no doubt that this hard - scattering approach ( hsa ) gives the correct description of exclusive hadronic processes in the limit of asymptotically large momentum transfer .",
    "but there is increasing evidence that the pure perturbative contribution is not the dominant one at experimentally accessible momentum transfers . a reasonable reproduction of the existing exclusive large-@xmath3 data is only achieved with very endpoint- concentrated hadron das , like those proposed by chernyak and zhitnitsky on the basis of qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "such das , however , occur to be problematic for a perturbative calculation since they enhance contributions from the soft end - point regions in the convolution integral  @xcite .",
    "some improvement with regard to the consistency of the perturbative calculation can be achieved by applying a modified factorization scheme in which transverse - momentum effects and sudakov suppressions are included . but",
    "this leads to a substantial reduction of the perturbative contribution  @xcite . for the pion",
    "an end - point concentrated da meanwhile seems even to be ruled out by the recent cleo data  @xcite for the @xmath10-transition form factor , since it provides a much too large perturbative result . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown recently for electromagnetic nucleon form factors  @xcite and for wide - angle compton scattering  @xcite off protons that the existing data can be saturated by soft overlap contributions .",
    "furthermore , these contributions can be modeled by a nucleon light- cone wave function which gives rise to a distribution amplitude close to the asymptotic one .",
    "this , however , implies that the perturbative contribution becomes small .",
    "the approach which we are going to apply for hard exclusive photoproduction of @xmath1 mesons is still based on the hsa but includes also a certain amount of soft physics which is modeled by means of diquarks .",
    "diquarks may be considered as an effective way to account for quark - quark correlations in baryon wave functions .",
    "part of the soft overlap contributions are then absorbed into phenomenologically parameterized diquark form factors which occur at the gauge - boson diquark vertices .",
    "this hsa - based diquark model has already been applied successfully to other photon - induced hadronic reactions like magnetic and electric baryon form factors in the space- @xcite and time - like region @xcite , real and virtual compton scattering @xcite , two - photon annihilation into baryon - antibaryon @xcite , and photoproduction of @xmath11-mesons  @xcite .",
    "further applications of the diquark model include the charmonium decay @xmath12 @xcite and the calculation of landshoff contributions in elastic proton - proton scattering @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present investigation is to extend this foregoing work to @xmath13 .",
    "the reason why we concentrate on the @xmath1 channel is that it is cleaner and simpler than photoproduction of @xmath5 or @xmath6 mesons . within the hsa the valence fock state of the @xmath1 , i.e. the @xmath14-@xmath15 state",
    ", can only be produced via the exchange of two gluons between the @xmath1 and the proton .",
    "quark exchange could only happen via the knockout of an @xmath14-@xmath15 pair from the strange - quark sea in the nucleon which is , however , power suppressed within the hsa .    in the following section we start with a short outline of the diquark model , show how feynman",

    "as already mentioned before , within the hsa an exclusive scattering amplitude at large momentum transfer is expressed as a convolution integral of a hard - scattering amplitude with hadron distribution amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "is assumed to consist of a quark ( @xmath21 ) and a diquark ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we fix our notation in such a way that the momentum fraction appearing in the argument of @xmath23 is carried by the quark  with the momentum fraction of the other constituent ( either diquark or antiquark ) it sums up to 1 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ kinem ] ) . for our actual calculations the ( logarithmic ) @xmath20 dependence of the das",
    "is neglected throughout since it is of minor importance in the restricted energy and momentum - transfer range we are interested in .",
    "the hard scattering amplitude @xmath24 is calculated perturbatively .",
    "intrinsic transverse momenta of the constituents are thereby neglected , i.e. , one assumes that the momenta of the constituents are collinear to those of their parent hadron .",

    "eight of the , altogether , sixteen diagrams which contribute to photoproduction of ( heavy ) quarkonia are depicted in fig .",
    "the subscript @xmath26 of @xmath27 represents a set of possible photon , proton and vector - meson helicities . for our purposes it appears to be more convenient to express the analytical results in terms of massless mandelstam variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 than in terms of the usual ( massive ) ones .",

    "the dynamics of @xmath31 and @xmath32 diquarks is determined by their coupling to photons and gluons .",
    "the expressions for the photon - diquark and gluon - diquark vertices correspond ( almost ) to the most general form for the ( parity and time - reversal invariant ) coupling of a spin-1 gauge boson to a spin-0 or a spin-1 particle , respectively  @xcite .",

    "are combined in a group which we call n - point contribution .",
    "finally the composite nature of diquarks is taken into account by multiplying each n - point contribution with phenomenological vertex functions , the diquark form factors . the particular choice @xmath35 for 3-point contributions and @xmath36 for n - point contributions ( @xmath37 ) ensures that in the limit @xmath38 the scaling behavior of the diquark model goes over in that of the pure quark hsp .",
    "the factor @xmath39 ( @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) provides the correct powers of @xmath42 for asymptotically large @xmath43 . for the running coupling @xmath44 the one - loop result @xmath45",

    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are strength parameters which allow for the possibility of diquark excitation and break - up in intermediate states where diquarks can be far off - shell .",
    "having sketched how diquarks are treated perturbatively , a few words about the choice of the das ( which incorporate the bound - state dynamics of the hadronic constituents ) and the spin - flavor wave functions of the proton and the @xmath1 are in order .",

    "( [ wfcov ] ) the color part of the quark - diquark wave function has been neglected .",

    "the origin of the phenomenological baryon da , eq .",
    "( [ dap ] ) , is a non - relativistic harmonic - oscillator wave function ( cf .",

    "the reasons why we want to include hadron - mass effects in the hard scattering amplitude are twofold . on the one hand , we want to apply our model already at momentum transfers of only a few gev , where hadron masses may still play a role . on the other hand ,",
    "we also want to make predictions for spin observables which require the flip of hadronic helicities . within usual perturbative qcd",
    "such observables would vanish since a spin-1 gauge boson which couples to a nearly massless ( current ) quark can not flip the helicity of the quark . in the original diquark model  @xcite violations of hadronic helicity conservation are generated by massive v- diquarks on the account of introducing a mass parameter for the v - diquark . in this paper",
    "we adopt another strategy which allows for a more consistent treatment of mass effects without introducing new mass parameters for the hadronic constituents . like the authors of ref .  @xcite we assume for every hadronic constituent that its 4-momentum is proportional to the 4-momentum of its parent hadron .",
    "this requires to assign to every constituent of the hadron @xmath19 an effective mass @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the fraction of the four- momentum of the hadron @xmath19 carried by the constituent . keeping in mind that the momentum fractions are weighted by the hadron das in the convolution integral , eq .",
    "( [ convol ] ) , this means that quarks and diquarks acquire ( on the average ) a mass which is rather the mass of a constituent than a current particle .",
    "this may be interpreted in such a way that at intermediate momentum transfers a quark or diquark surrounded by a cloud of @xmath154 pairs and gluons is not resolved but rather acts like a single effective particle with a corresponding mass .",
    "this prescription for the constituent masses applies to the ( on - shell ) particles which correspond to the external legs of the feynman diagrams .",

    "( [ dap ] ) the average values of the effective masses of quarks and diquarks in a proton become @xmath155 analogously the effective mass of the heavy ( anti)quark in the meson becomes on the average half of the meson mass .",

    "@xcite the influence of nucleonic resonance effects on polarization observables in @xmath1-meson photoproduction has been investigated within a constituent - quark model in which the diffractive contribution is produced by t - channel pomeron exchange .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the result of these authors for the target asymmetry at a rather small photon energy of @xmath247  gev is comparable in size to our result at @xmath214  gev .",
    "this is remarkable since two completely different concepts are at work : on one hand nucleonic resonance contributions , on the other hand a purely perturbative mechanism . also for the beam asymmetry some similarities can be found .",
    "the corresponding predictions of both approaches are again comparable around @xmath233 .",
    "a ( somewhat smaller ) negative beam asymmetry has also been found in another model which is based on pomeron exchange , pion exchange , and a direct knockout production from the strange - quark sea in the proton  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see experimentally , whether polarization observables like the target asymmetry @xmath248 , the recoil polarization @xmath249 , or the vector - meson polarization @xmath250 , which vanish in leading - order perturbative qcd , are still sizable at momentum transfers of a few gev .",
    "such observables would be a more sensitive tool than the unpolarized differential cross section to figure out whether the kind of nonperturbative ingredients ( diquarks , effective constituent masses ) which are taken into account in our perturbative approach , are already sufficient , or whether much more non - perturbative physics is still at work at a few gev of momentum transfer .    at the end of this section",
    "we want to comment on the perspective to extend this calculation to photoproduction of @xmath7 .",
    "it is a simple matter , since we have already assumed a flavor dependent da for the vector meson ( cf .",
    "( [ dabc ] ) ) .",
    "the only thing to do is to replace the @xmath1 mass by the @xmath7 mass and the decay constant @xmath251 by @xmath252 .",
    "one , however , has to keep in mind that we have applied an expansion in the parameter @xmath151 . in order",
    "that this parameter is approximately of the same size in @xmath1 and @xmath7 production the photon lab energy has to be increased approximately by a factor @xmath253 when going from @xmath1 to @xmath7 .",
    "a second criterion for the reliability of our approximate treatment of mass effects is that the coefficient of the first mass correction term should become small compared to the leading order .",
    "this coefficient is angular dependent and becomes large at small scattering angle .",
    "that means , if the size of the mass corrections relative to the leading order should be about the same in @xmath1 and @xmath7 production ( @xmath151 comparable ) , one has to consider much larger momentum transfers for @xmath7 than for @xmath1 production",
    ". a more detailed discussion of this point along with some numerical results can be found in ref .",
    "a possible way to apply the perturbative approach to @xmath7 production at a few gev of momentum transfer would be to retain our prescription for the choice of the effective masses , but to refrain from the final expansion in @xmath151 .",
    "this has not been attempted yet since the analytical expressions for the amplitudes become very lengthy and the treatment of propagator singularities in the convolution integral , eq .  ( [ convol ] ) , becomes much more involved .",
    "we have investigated the reaction @xmath254 in the few - gev momentum transfer region where unpolarized differential cross - section data from the cebaf-93 - 031 experiment at jlab are expected to become available very soon .",
    "our theoretical approach is based on perturbative qcd supplemented by the assumption that baryons can be treated as quark - diquark systems .",
    "the same approach has already been successfully applied to other photon - induced hadronic reactions  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for introducing diquarks is , above all , to extend the perturbative approach from large down to moderately large momentum transfers .",
    "there are mainly two reasons why this can be achieved with diquarks .",
    "first , the overall momentum transfer has to be shared between less hadronic constituents than in the pure quark hsa .",
    "hence the gluons which keep the hadronic constituents collinear are on the average harder and thus the running strong coupling constant becomes smaller .",
    "the second reason is that a certain class of non - perturbative effects , namely quark - quark correlations inside a baryon , are effectively accounted for by means of diquarks .",
    "the fact that a heavy quarkonium is produced in the final state entails a considerable reduction in computational effort .",
    "only a small fraction of the feynman diagrams which contribute in general to photoproduction of arbitrary mesons occurs in @xmath1 production . to be more specific , these are just those diagrams in which the photon fluctuates into the heavy quark - antiquark pair which is then connected to the quark and the diquark in the proton via the exchange of two gluons , respectively . both , the scalar and the vector - diquark component of the proton have been taken into account .",
    "we have also improved the diquark model in the sense that hadron - mass effects in the hard - scattering amplitude have been included in a systematic way .",
    "this has been accomplished by assigning to each hadronic constituent an effective mass @xmath255 ( @xmath256 longitudinal momentum fraction of the constituent ) and expanding the scattering amplitude in the small parameter @xmath151 .",
    "only the leading and next - to - leading order terms in this expansion have been kept .",
    "the leading - order term provides for the hadron - helicity - conserving amplitudes and agrees , of course , with the massless result .",
    "the next - to - leading order term represents a power- correction and gives rise to non - vanishing hadron - helicity - flip amplitudes .",
    "it enables us to make predictions for polarization observables which require the flip of a hadronic helicity like , e.g. , the target asymmetry or the recoil polarization .",
    "we want to point out that our treatment of mass effects still preserves gauge invariance with respect to the photon and the gluon .",
    "our numerical studies have been performed with the diquark - model parameters and the quark- diquark das proposed in ref .",
    "the da of the @xmath1 meson has been taken from the literature  @xcite .",
    "it fulfills qcd sum - rule constraints .",
    "hence we have been able to make predictions without introducing new parameters .",
    "we have paid special attention to the correct and numerically robust treatment of propagator singularities . in the absence of large-@xmath3 data",
    "( @xmath257  gev@xmath216 ) our results can only be compared with the available data which go up to @xmath258  gev@xmath216 .",
    "our predictions for the differential cross section at two rather different photon energies ( @xmath214  gev and @xmath259  gev ) which are typical for cebaf and hera , respectively , occur to be still within the range of an extrapolation of the existing low-@xmath3 data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the predictions of a two - gluon - exchange model , in which the gluons are considered as a remnant of the pomeron  @xcite , become comparable to our result for @xmath257  gev@xmath216 if the gluons are allowed to couple to different quarks in the proton .",
    "this is not surprising because contributions in which all the hadronic constituents are ( approximately ) kept collinear by means of gluon exchange to prevent the hadrons from breaking up become increasingly important as soon as one enters the hard - scattering domain .",
    "just those contributions are assumed to be the dominant ones within our hsa - based diquark model .",
    "we have also investigated within our model whether the ( asymptotic ) @xmath228 scaling behavior of the differential cross section at fixed angle is already realized for @xmath14 values between @xmath231 and @xmath260  gev . after dividing out the strong running coupling ( which occurs to the sixth power in the cross section ) an approximate @xmath228 scaling has been found .",
    "our investigation of hadron - mass effects has revealed that they are still non - negligible in the few- gev momentum transfer range and photon energies of the order of 10  gev .",
    "correspondingly , also polarization observables which require the flip of a hadronic helicity , like the target polarization , occur to be sizable .",
    "finally , we have considered the possibility to extend the present calculation to photoproduction of @xmath7 mesons . in order",
    "that our treatment of mass effects remains reliable for @xmath7s one has to go to much larger energies and momentum transfers where experimental data can not be expected .",
    "the situation with respect to the momentum transfer could perhaps be improved by refraining from the final expansion in @xmath151 .",
    "this , however , will considerably complicate the treatment of propagator singularities and make the analytical expressions for the amplitudes much more complicated",
    ". therefore it has not been attempted as yet .",
    "our diquark - model calculations for @xmath261 will meet the first severe test in the near future when the data analysis of the cebaf 93 - 031 experiment will be completed .",
    "with these data , which go up to @xmath3 values of about 5  gev@xmath216 , one will get a first glimpse how different production mechanisms ( pomeron exchange @xmath262 gluon exchange @xmath262 hard - scattering mechanism ) in high - energy photoproduction evolve with increasing momentum transfer . however , in order to really touch the hard - scattering domain much higher photon energies than those which can be reached at the present stage of cebaf would be desirable .",
    "in addition to unpolarized differential cross sections , polarization observables which require the flip of hadronic helicities , could serve as an indicator for the relative importance of hard and soft photoproduction mechanisms , since hard scattering is closely connected with hadronic helicity conservation .    c. f. berger would like to thank the paul - urban - stipendienstiftung for supporting a visit at the institute of theoretical physics at the university of graz during which part of this paper has been completed .",
