    "it has been known since the 70 s that topological defects such as domain walls can trap fermions on their world volumes @xcite . in the 80 s",
    "this fact formed an integral part of suggestions that one may regard our universe as a domain wall @xcite , or more generally a brane in a higher dimensional universe @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the fermionic chiral matter making up the standard model is composed of such trapped zero modes @xcite .",
    "a similar mechanism is used in models , such as the horawa - witten model @xcite of heterotic m - theory , in which two domain walls are present .",
    "our world is localized on one brane and a shadow world is localized on the other brane .",
    "the existence of models with more than one brane suggests that branes may collide , and it is natural to suppose that the big bang is associated with the collision @xcite .",
    "this raises the fascinating questions of what happens to the localized fermions during such collisions ? put more picturesquely , what is the fate of the standard model during brane collision ? in this paper",
    "we shall embark on what we believe is the first study of this question by solving numerically the dirac equation for a fermions coupled via yukawa interaction to a system of two colliding domain walls , i.e. a kink - anti - kink collision in five - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "each individual domain wall may be described analytically by a static solution and given such a solution one may easily find analytically the fermion zero modes , which from the point of view of the 3 + 1 dimensional world volume behave like massless chiral fermions .",
    "the back reaction of the fermions on the domain wall is here , and throughout this paper , neglected .",
    "kink - anti - kink collisions , have recently been studied numerically @xcite .",
    "one solves the scalar field equations with initial data corresponding to a superposition of the boosted profiles of a kink and an anti - kink .",
    "it was found @xcite that , depending on the initial relative velocity that such domain wall pairs can pass through one another , or bounce , or suffer a number of bounces in a fashion reminiscent of the cyclic universe scenario @xcite .",
    "one may extend the treatment to include gravity @xcite but in this paper we shall , for the sake of our preliminary study , work throughout with gravity switched off .",
    "one may now solve the dirac equation in the time dependent background generated by the kink - anti - kink collision .",
    "we use as initial data for the dirac equation the boosted profiles of the chiral zero modes associated with the individual domain walls .",
    "what we find was for us unexpected and quite remarkable .",
    "if the initial fermions exist on both branes , then without exception , for a whole range of initial conditions , the two initially distinct but localized fermion distributions merge in the neighborhood of the collision , and then emerge after the collision again localized on one or the other kink .",
    "by contrast if one of the kinks is empty , which we refer to as a vacuum brane , then the amplitudes of the fermions on the kinks after the collision highly depend on the incident velocity and the coupling constants .",
    "we start with a discussion of five - dimensional ( 5d ) four - component fermions in a time - dependent domain wall in 5d minkowski spacetime . as a domain wall ,",
    "we adopt a 5d real scalar field @xmath0 with an appropriate potential @xmath1 . the 5d dirac equation with a yukawa coupling term @xmath2",
    "is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a 5d four - component fermion .",
    "@xmath5 are the dirac matrices in 5d minkowski spacetime satisfying the anticommutation relations , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is minkowski metric .",
    "we explicitly use the following dirac - pauli representation @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the pauli @xmath10 matrices .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ dirac_eq ] ) implies current conservation law : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is conserved number current .",
    "here we define @xmath13 .",
    "this gives conserved number density @xmath14 .",
    "the total number of fermions is defined by @xmath15 , which is conserved .",
    "later we shall need the fact that the dirac equation ( [ dirac_eq ] ) has the following time reversal and reflection symmetries : + ( 1 ) if @xmath16 is a solution of the dirac equation with scalar field @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a solution of the dirac equation with the scalar field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the coordinate of a fifth dimension . in particular , when there is no interaction ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) , @xmath18 is time reversal of @xmath16 + ( 2 ) if @xmath16 is a solution of the dirac equation with scalar field @xmath17 , @xmath23 is a solution of the dirac equation with the scalar field @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath16 is a solution for a kink [ an anti - kink ] , @xmath25 is a solution for an anti - kink [ a kink ] .",
    "it will turn out that the solution with a kink [ an anti - kink ] is related to positive [ negative ] chiral fermions , which are defined below ( see next subsection ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) combining ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we find that @xmath26 is a solution of the dirac equation with @xmath27    if we assume some symmetries for a domain wall , we find further properties for fermions as follows .",

    "+ ( iii ) we may also have time symmetry such that @xmath30 for collision of two walls .",
    "in fact we find from numerical analysis that this ansatz is approximately correct @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath31-reflection symmetry as well , we find from ( 3 ) that @xmath32 , which is time reversal and @xmath31-reflection of @xmath33 , is also a solution for the same scalar field @xmath34 .    before going to analyze concrete examples ,",
    "we introduce two chiral fermion states @xmath35 this definition implies @xmath36 using the representation ( [ dirac_rep ] ) , we have @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two - component spinors .",
    "the dirac equation ( [ dirac_eq ] ) is now reduced to @xmath40      as for a domain wall , now we assume the potential form is given by @xmath41 . here",
    "we recall the dimension of some variables . since we discuss five dimensional spacetime , we have the following dimensionality : @xmath42=[\\eta]=l^{-3/2 } , [ \\psi]=l^{-2 } , [ g]=l^{1/2 } , [ \\lambda]=l \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a scale length .",

    "when a domain wall is moving , however , @xmath0 is time - dependent , and then the above prescription ( separation of the fifth coordinate ) to find wave functions is no longer valid .",
