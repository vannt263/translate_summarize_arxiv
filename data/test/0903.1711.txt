    "( [ sd.1 ] ) is customarily required for solving several classes of physical problems , occurring in optics , quantum mechanics , statistical physics , fluid mechanics , and so on . in optics ,",
    "the evaluation of several diffraction integrals is customarily carried out asymptotically by identifying the parameter @xmath5 as the wavenumber of the radiation . in quantum mechanics , the same role",
    "is played by the inverse of the planck s constant , while in fluid mechanics by the reynold s number@xcite .    in the stationary phase treatment of diffraction",
    "integrals the values of the associated complex wavefield are asymptotically evaluated by taking the contributions coming from the stationary points of @xmath4 , each of them associated to a  ray \" in the corresponding geometrical picture .",
    "of particular importance is the birth and the death , as the spatial parameters ruling the  phase \" function @xmath6 vary , of  evanescent \" rays across sets of codimension 1 , named  stokes sets \" @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7- , or weniger , transformation@xcite ( wt for short ) , is particularly efficient for resumming the factorial divergent asymptotic series well away from stokes sets , as well as sets where two or more saddles are symmetrically placed in the complex singulant space@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as with other resummation techniques@xcite , the wt fails to perform across stokes sets .",
    "the reason of such a failure stems to the extreme `` specialization '' of the transformation itself , which requires , for a successful resummation , an alternating sign pattern of the sequence of the single terms of the series@xcite .",
    "several methods have been conceived for resumming nonalternating , slowly convergent or divergent , sequences @xcite , some of them being based on the serial combination of various resummation techniques@xcite . for the class of saddle - point integrals in eq .",
    "( [ sd.1 ] ) , the marriage between hyperasymptotics@xcite ( h for short ) and the wt @xcite , generating the so - called h - wt ( which stands for hyperasymptotic - weniger transformation ) , allows the wt to successfully operate also across stokes sets .    basically , the h - wt consists in the sequential application , to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sd.1 ] ) , of a classical hyperasymptotic treatment , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , followed by the action of the wt on all asymptotic divergent series generated by h. in particular , the results obtained have shown how the 1st - order h - wt , for which only the first - stage of h is anticipated to the wt , is able to provide relative errors several orders of magnitude smaller than those achievable via the use of full hyperasymptotic treatments and with considerably lighter computational complexity and effort .",
    "a key aspect is that , differently from h , the first truncation operated on the starting asymptotic series has not to be an optimal , in the sense of superasymptotics ( i.e. , at the least term ) one , but rather the corresponding truncation order , say @xmath8 , must be used as a free parameter for the subsequent application of the wt .    a question which was not addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but mentioned only in the last sentence , is whether wt and h can be combined to higher orders in h , and if so , how the accuracy improves with order .",
    "the present paper is aimed at giving a first answer to such a question .",
    "we shall limit our analysis only to the second stage of h. further increasing of the h - wt order would be achievable along the same guidelines outlined here . on the other hand , it should be noted how , on increasing the order of h , the number of asymptotic series associated to the corresponding remainder that have to be resummed exponentially grows for topologies involving more than two saddles and , at the same time , the number of free parameters ( i.e. , the truncation orders at each h step ) linearly increases .",
    "accordingly , from a mere computational viewpoint , it is mandatory to find a compromise between the h - wt order and the computational effort .",
    "some limits of the 1st - order h - wt have already been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , where asymptotic evaluations of saddle - point integrals for  small \" values of the asymptotic parameter were considered . in such cases , in fact , to increase the parameter @xmath8 of the 1st - order h - wt does not necessarily lead to an improvement of the reached accuracy , but often results in the opposite , i.e. , a worsening of it .",
    "it is just the above scenario that we are interested in when the 2nd - level h - wt will be developed .",
    "numerical experiments will be carried out on the class of saddle - point integrals already considered in the numerical sections of the first paper @xcite . moreover",
    ", asymptotic evaluations of the so - called swallowtail diffraction catastrophe @xcite will be proposed as a new numerical experiment .",
    "the swallowtail function is defined via eq .",
    "( [ sd.1 ] ) with @xmath4 being a 5th - order polynomial with respect to @xmath2 , thus involving a four saddle network .",
    "we will present a study of the accuracy achievable via h - wt asymptotic evaluations of the swallowtail diffraction catastrophe for points placed at the stokes set , following the prescriptions by berry and howls@xcite . in doing so",
    ", we will find that the corresponding asymptotic expanding coefficients can be expressed in closed - form terms .",
    "for any practical implementation of the h - wt , a key role is played by the numerical evaluation of the corresponding hyperterminants@xcite which are defined through suitable multiple integrals .",
    "for the lowest - order hyperterminant the exact analytical expression is available from literature@xcite , but unfortunately this is not true for higher - order hyperterminants , included those involved in the 2nd - level h - wt . in the present paper",
    "we solve the problem of the 2nd - level hyperterminant exact evaluation for a particular , but very important , choice of the hyperterminant parameters , which often occurs in the implementation of h for evaluating a wide class of saddle - point integrals . up to our knowledge",
    ", this is a new result which also provides an interesting connection of such hypeterminants to the meijer - g functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , although the closed - form evaluation of 2nd - level hypeterminants for arbitrary choices of their parameters seems to remain an open problem , in the present paper we find a semi - analytical representation which turns out to be suitable for numerical calculations via standard integration packages . similarly as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of our aims is to keep the paper reasonably self - consistent .",
    "accordingly , in the next section a brief review of h , up to the 2nd - level , is given .",
    "as far as the wt is concerned , we believe that what is contained in ref . @xcite , together with the extensive bibliography , should be enough also for a nonexpert reader . for this reason , we do not repeat it in the present paper .",

    "we shall find that all subsequent numerical experiments present the same characteristic . as a first remark",

    "[ figerrorairyf16 ] that a relative error of the order of @xmath100 , achieved through the 2nd - level h - wt with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , would be reached via a 1st - order h - wt by letting @xmath103 , but with a considerable saving of computational effort .",
    "the above example clearly suggests the use of the 2nd - level h - wt only in those cases where the best accuracy attainable via the 1st - level h - wt turns out to be not adequate .",

    "unfortunately , differently from h , for which the optimal settings of the hyperseries truncations are directly extracted from the singulant values@xcite , at present it does not seem possible to provide similar information for the h - wt . the difficulties in giving practical guidelines for the choice of @xmath8 and @xmath110 can also be appreciated from the results presented in sec .
