    "high energy ion generation in the interaction of intense laser pulses with mass - limited targets is promising for applications in a wide range , from the development of ion sources for medicine and the fast ignition of controlled thermonuclear fusion to the investigation of warm dense matter , high energy density phenomena , and laboratory astrophysics ( see review articles @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "mass - limited targets otherwise called reduced mass targets have a finite transverse size comparable with the laser focal spot diameter @xcite .",
    "their principal advantage is that an intense laser pulse can remove much more electrons from it than from a wide and thick target .",
    "this generates a greater electrostatic potential thus enhancing the ion acceleration . in wider targets , electrons from the periphery",
    "additionally reduce the ion acceleration quickly smoothing out the electric potential , while in thick targets , the laser radiation can not reach deeper layers .",
    "the advantage of mass - limited targets is best seen with isolated clusters , from which an intense laser sweeps all the electrons .",
    "then the coulomb explosion occurs : the ions are accelerated under the repulsion force of uncompensated electric charge .",
    "a pure coulomb explosion provides an isotropic ion acceleration with very characteristic energy spectrum , where a large number of ions acquire a high energy @xcite .",
    "when the laser radiation can not penetrate inside the target deeper than the skin depth , it heats electrons creating a plasma sheath with a strong electric charge separation .",
    "the latter causes the ion acceleration in the target normal sheath acceleration ( tnsa ) regime @xcite . in mass - limited targets , this regime can give a substantial contribution to the ion acceleration when the laser pulse power is far from being enough to wipe all the electrons .",
    "for sufficiently high intense laser pulses and optimally dense targets , the laser radiation pressure pushes the target as a whole in the propagation direction , while the target remains , on average , mostly quasi - neutral .",
    "this is the regime of the radiation pressure dominated acceleration ( rpda ) of ions @xcite .",
    "a tailored laser pulse can provide in principle unlimited ion acceleration @xcite . in the case of a mass - limited target , the rpda of ions can be stable even if the target is initially off - axis @xcite .",
    "a combination of the rpda and a subsequent coulomb explosion of a thick target leads to a directed coulomb explosion regime of the ion acceleration @xcite .",
    "in general , a laser system produces a high - intensity short - duration ( main ) pulse on top of a relatively low - intensity nanosecond ( background ) amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) , possibly with a few prepulses .",
    "the main - pulse - to - background intensity ratio is called the laser pulse contrast . when a laser pulse with a finite contrast irradiates a solid target ,",
    "preplasma is created before the main pulse arrival .",
    "preplasma is a plasma region where the density gradually drops from values typical to solid state at some depth in the target down to a value well below the critical density .",
    "preplasma created around structured snow - targets irradiated by intense laser pulses facilitates the efficient ion acceleration via the edge field intensification effect @xcite .",
    "the main pulse interacting first with preplasma exhibits regimes typical to gaseous targets , especially when the plasma density is near - critical . under these conditions ,",
    "laser radiation can form a long - living quasi - static magnetic dipole leading to the magnetic vortex acceleration regime @xcite , or can create a shock wave putting into effect the shock wave acceleration @xcite .",
    "while the main pulse loses its energy in preplasma it can also self - focus due to relativistic effects @xcite , thus an optimised preplasma can crucially enhance the ion acceleration @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate how the above mentioned ion acceleration mechanisms reveals itself depending on the geometry of a mass - limited target and a plasma corona around it .",
    "we carry out two - dimensional ( 2d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations using the remp code based on the density decomposition scheme @xcite .",
    "we describe the effects occurring in the presence of a plasma corona around a mass - limited target : the enhancement of the coulomb explosion of the ion core of the target due to the density squeezing by the quasistatic magnetic field , formation of a density hole near the tip of the target due to plasma resonance , etc . the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the laser and target parameters and the simulation configuration . in section iii ,",
    "the results of pic simulations of the laser pulse interaction with mass - limited targets in a wide range of the irradiation parameters are presented . there",
    "we discuss the effects of magnetic squeezing and electric field intensification at the target edge on the ion acceleration . in section iv , we consider the high power limit when the ion acceleration occurs in the radiation pressure dominated acceleration regime . in the concluding section ,",
    "we summarize the results obtained .",
    "in order to investigate the processes that occur during the interaction of a relativistically strong laser pulse with a mass - limited water ice target surrounded by a plasma corona , we conduct a series of 2d pic simulations .",
    "the laser pulse is obliquely incident on the target as is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the plasma corona with a typical size of the order of several tens of micrometers plays an important role in the laser interaction with mass - limited targets @xcite .",
    "when it is created due to a finite contrast of the laser pulse , it has a typical density profile consisting of three regions ( see also ref .",
    "the first region is a plateau with the solid density , corresponding to unperturbed portion of the target .",
    "the second region has the density profile which can be approximated by the gaussian function as shown in the lower panel of fig .",

    "the plasma density linearly drops with a substantially larger scale .    in our simulations , the target has the shape of an ellipsoid , so that the same density value curves are ellipses .",
    "for such a shape it is enough to describe the density profile along the major semi - axes .",
    "we assume the following density profile .",
    "the density decreases from maximum according to the gaussian function down to @xmath3 , then it linearly drops down to @xmath4 , then it is truncated to zero . in order to restrict the total number of quasi - particles representing plasma ( which amounts to @xmath5 ) , we limit the plasma density by the cutoff at @xmath6 . for moderate laser intensities , when the laser radiation pressure is not dominant in the interaction , this artificial cutoff does not significantly affect the simulation results , as justified by a number of test simulations performed without a density cutoff ( note the analogous computational trick used in ref .",

    "we present the results for a relatively high eccentricity , @xmath7 , of the ellipsoid representing the target shape .",
    "this choice allows emphasizing the effects of a quasistatic magnetic field generated during the interaction . in preliminary simulations ( not shown here ) we have found that for targets with a smaller eccentricity the quasi - static magnetic field is not sufficiently symmetrical with respect to the target major axis .",
    "the ion energy reaches maximum when the magnetic field is generated in a symmetrical way ( this is applicable for moderate laser intensities , when the laser radiation pressure does not dominate the interaction ) .",
    "if the target has the form of a foil ( in terms of ellipsoid target , it means that the major semiaxis is substantially larger than the laser focal spot size ) , the electrons move away from the region of irradiation , along the target surface , so that the associated quasi - static magnetic field disperses along the target surface and eventually dissipates .",

    "the laser pulse is obliquely incident on the target at the angle of 45 degrees .",
    "this configuration is chosen to maximize the laser energy transmission to the target .",
    "for references concerning the dimensional values of the target density , laser energy and intensity , etc , the laser wavelength can be assumed to be @xmath19 .",

    "here by using the 2d pic simulations we show that the configurations corresponding to the mass - limited targets surrounded by an underdense plasma corona exhibit a number of effects enhancing the maximum energy and increasing the total number of high energy ions .",
    "we observe the magnetic squeezing of the underdense parts of the target , when the pressure of self - generated quasi - static magnetic field pushes the electrons and ions into the target thus increasing the target plasma density .",
    "this effect has an important implication at the stage of the coulomb explosion enlarging the achievable ion energy .",
    "while not giving the maximum energy in the whole fast ion population , it is still a major factor in the proton acceleration as it allows to accelerate a substantial ( large compared with the maximum energy isotropic component ) number of protons up to energies that are an order of magnitude larger than the majority of protons are accelerated to .",
    "hole boring by the electric field arising due to the edge intensification and the plasma resonance at the sharp edge of the target is considered to be in strong correlation with the proton acceleration at the beginning of the interaction ( before coulomb explosions of the main target and preliminary compressed filaments come into play ) , providing the maximum proton energy at this interaction stage . strong anisotropy of the proton acceleration in such a high - eccentricity ellipsoidal target is also an important feature that can be used for the generation of strongly collimated proton beams .",
    "we also demonstrate than the presence of down - ramp density corona around the target can increase the maximum ion energies in comparison with flat density profiles .",
