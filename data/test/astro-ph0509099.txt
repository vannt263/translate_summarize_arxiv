    "two of the major puzzles of contemporary cosmology are the nature of dark matter and of dark energy , the two big players in the cosmic arena .",
    "so far , the only knowledge of these components refers to their density fraction and to their equation of state , and even on these numbers we still have a large uncertainty .",
    "greater still is the ignorance of their clustering properties : although we assume that essentially all the dark matter clusters in observable objects and all the dark energy does remain quite homogeneous , this is to a large extent only a simplification rather a consequence of observations .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that many works are currently devoted to the possibility of merging the two puzzles into a single one : that is , finding a single origin for both dark matter and dark energy .",
    "a possibility is to assume an interaction between dark matter and dark energy @xcite or to fit both into a single complex field @xcite .",
    "however , these models still contain two separate fields that account ultimately for the two components . on a different level",
    "lies the hypothesis that there is a single fluid that behaves as dark matter or dark energy according to the background or the local density .",
    "since there is only one unifying dark - matter - energy component , besides baryons , photons and neutrinos , this model is usually referred to as quartessence @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological prototype of quartessence models is the generalized chaplygin model @xcite , an exotic fluid with an inverse power law homogeneous equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 has dimension of mass and @xmath5 is a dimensionless parameter ( @xmath6 is the original chaplygin gas ) .",
    "such equation of state leads to a component which behaves as dust in the past and as cosmological constant in the future . for @xmath7",
    "the model reduces to @xmath1cdm @xcite .    for a wide range of values of the parameter @xmath8 ,",
    "the quartessence chaplygin model is compatible with several cosmological tests that involve only the background metric mak03b .",
    "nevertheless , problems may occur when one considers perturbations .",
    "for instance , the cmb anisotropies spectrum is strongly suppressed with respect to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "further , it was shown that , unless @xmath8 is very much close to @xmath10 , the mass power spectrum presents strong instabilities and oscillations @xcite .",
    "a quantitative cmb analysis @xcite ( see also @xcite for a pre - wmap analysis of the generalized chaplygin gas as dark energy ) found that the parameter @xmath8 should be small ( @xmath11 at 95% cl ) , even including an additional cdm component , and smaller still without the latter .",
    "we will show below that in fact this limit reduces to @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that this strong limit is due to the finite sound speed of the chaplygin fluid : when it is sufficiently large and positive , it prevents clustering on small scales and therefore introduces a cut in the power spectrum which is at odds with observations ; when it is negative , on the other hand , the clustering at small scales is enhanced beyond control .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that unlike the background tests , the perturbation analysis need further assumptions beyond the equation of state . in @xcite , it was shown that it is possible to avoid the mass power spectrum problem if , for instance , pressure perturbation vanishes .",
    "this can be done by introducing a special type of intrinsic entropy perturbation such that the effective sound speed @xcite of the cosmic fluid vanishes ( we denote this as _ silent perturbations _ ) .",
    "we call the chaplygin quartessence model with vanishing pressure perturbation _",
    "silent chaplygin _ and refer to the standard case as _ _",
    "adiabatic chaplygin__.    the main goal of this paper is to show that , unlike adiabatic chaplygin , silent chaplygin is consistent with cmb data for a wide range of parameters .",
    "besides cmb , we also consider consistency of silent chaplygin with current data from large scale structure , from type ia supernovae ( snia ) and baryon fraction in galaxy clusters .",
    "using the latest data sets , we review all these tests using a careful treatment , presenting the outcome of a combined analysis of the data for both silent and adiabatic chaplygin .",
    "in this section we give a brief and basic description of the model .",
    "the conservation equation for the generalized chaplygin  gas component in a robertson - walker metric is solved by @xmath13^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } ,   \\label{rhox}\\]]where @xmath14 is the scale factor ( @xmath15 today ) and @xmath16 is the present equation of state .",
    "the equation - of - state parameter ( @xmath17 ) and the adiabatic sound velocity ( @xmath18 ) for the chaplygin  gas , are given by @xmath19and @xmath20    from the equation above , it is clear that at early times , when @xmath21 we have @xmath22 , and the fluid behaves as non relativistic matter . at late times , when @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath24 .",
    "further , the adiabatic sound speed has maximum value when the equation of state parameter is minimum .",
    "therefore , the epoch of cosmic acceleration , in these models , coincides with that of large @xmath25 . as remarked in reis05 , this is a characteristic of all unified models in which the equation of state is convex , i.e. , is such that @xmath26 .",
    "however , this property is not mandatory for a general fluid .",
    "models with concavity changing equations of state , may have @xmath25 negligibly small when the energy density reaches its minimum value .",
    "this is an important property that must be considered in constructing acceptable adiabatic quartessence models @xcite .",
    "the perturbation equations for a fluid with equation of state @xmath27 and adiabatic sound speed @xmath25 in _ synchronous _ gauge are ( for the sake of simplicity , here we neglect baryons and radiation , and we assume that both spatial curvature and the anisotropic perturbation vanish ) @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30@xmath31where derivatives are with respect to @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the density contrast , @xmath34 is the density parameter , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are metric perturbations , @xmath37 is the divergence of the velocity perturbation , @xmath38 is the entropy perturbation and @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the conformal time . to these equations",

    "constraints on @xmath76 can be placed @xcite .",
    "further , by assuming that baryon mass fraction in clusters of galaxies is independent of redshift , it is also possible to constrain the geometry and , consequently , the dark energy density . a method based on this idea was suggested by sasaki @xcite and pen @xcite and further developed and applied by allen , schmidt , and fabian @xcite .    in this section",

    "[ silentcmb ] we contrast this result with the silent case : now the allowed region for @xmath46 widens a lot , encompassing values close to unity .",

    "[ silent1sdss ] , the results are rather similar to the cmb case .",
    "since we used only a very small subset of the whole parameters space we will not include the sdss likelihood in the combined likelihood of the next section .",
    "the loss in constraining power is acceptable since one can easily see that the cmb and the sdss confidence regions are overlapping to a good extent .",
    "moreover , extending the range of parameters as in the cmb case the sdss constraints would become weaker and would not add much to the information from the cmb .",
    "we also calculated the baryon fluctuation variance @xmath113 ( i.e. the absolute normalization of the spectrum ) for the same subset of parameters . in fig .",
    "[ s8 ] we show the contour plots of the likelihood assuming a gaussian distribution of the observed @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "this test is meant to be only qualitative since the value of @xmath113 that is derived from data is strongly degenerate with @xmath115 and with the bias factor and/or it depends on calibration obtained with @xmath93-body simulations based on some specific cosmological model .",
    "we only notice that for the silent chaplygin case there exists a large region in our parameter space which accounts for values of @xmath113 which are consistent with the standard estimation .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to note that the @xmath113 analysis shows preference for lower values of @xmath116 ( for a fixed @xmath8 ) than the cmb test .",
    "this could help to further reduce the parameters space .",

    "only models with @xmath46 very close to the @xmath117cdm limit are allowed .",
    "although including snia and clusters in the cmb analysis almost do not affect the constraints on @xmath46 , they tighten the constraints on the parameter @xmath47 , reducing even more the allowed region of the parameters space in the adiabatic case . the final result ( 95% c.l . ) for the adiabatic case is @xmath118 in contrast , in fig .",

    "the idea of unifying dark matter and dark energy through a single component has motivated many works in the last few years .",
    "most of these investigations concentrated their efforts in analyzing the generalized chaplygin fluid , that is considered the prototype of the quartessence models .",
    "after the results of @xcite , it became clear that adiabatic chaplygin , as quartessence , is ruled out unless the parameter @xmath8 is very close to zero .",
    "in the present paper we confirmed this result by using current cmb data , extending the quantitative results of @xcite to quartessence models .",
    "in fact , for an effective sound speed different from zero , any quartessence model with a convex eos will suffer the same kind of problem @xcite .",
    "there are two simple ways to get around this problem : choosing an eos not convex @xcite or introducing entropic perturbations as we did in this paper .",
    "this shows that indeed quartesence models of the chaplygin type ( one fluid , two parameters ) can be considered as real alternatives to @xmath1cdm ( two fluids , one parameter ) .",
    "it is clear however that these phenomenological models should be further investigated : the challenge is to connect them to a more fundamental theory .",
