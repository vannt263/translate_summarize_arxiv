    "we show that velvets can give much higher reduction in sey as compared to micro - pores configuration .",
    "in this paper we study reduction in sey by velvet surfaces both analytically and numerically .",
    "a velvet surface is a flat substrate onto which long , vertical whiskers are grown .",
    "the reduction of sey comes from the fact that low - energy true secondary electrons produced deep inside the velvet have a large probability of hitting a whisker and getting absorbed by the surface before exiting the velvet , therefore not contributing to net sey from the surface .",

    "we show that substituting regular lattice whiskers instead with a random distribution of whiskers having the same average packing density does not introduce significant change in sey .",
    "the probability for a secondary electron to intersect a whisker is similar for regular and random pattern of whiskers .",
    "qualitative agreement between mean - free - paths given by the rectangular lattice and random lattice assumptions is shown in figure [ figrect ] . in the random position case",
    ", this probability of not being intersecting with a whisker can be described by exponential dependence with the distance in the @xmath58 plane perpendicular to the whiskers axis , @xmath59 .",
    "this probability is given by    @xmath60    the mean - free - path is @xmath61    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the surface density of whiskers .",
    "this mean - free - path is determined from analogy to classical hard - sphere scattering in 3d .",
    "the cross section length that a cylinder presents is twice its radius , and the `` scattering density '' is simply the surface area density of whiskers , @xmath64 .    from figure [ figrect ]",
    "it is evident that for a rectangular lattice of whiskers and a random configuration with the same packing density , the mean - free - path is similar .",
    "our analytic model takes only one generation of true secondary electrons into consideration .",
    "we neglect sequential see caused by the first generation of secondary electrons .",
    "their contribution is not large as will be shown below , but their inclusion would add unnecessary complexity to the formulae derived .",
    "the sequential see can be added to the treatment in the future .",
    "the see can occur on one of three surfaces : on the top of the whisker , on the side surface , and on the bottom surface , as shown in figure [ figpops ] .",
    "hence the net @xmath65 consists of three contributions :    @xmath66    the top contribution is simply proportional to the ratio of surface of the top whiskers to the rest of the surface . consider a plane just below the whisker tops .",
    "the electrons have a uniform probability of hitting any area of that plane .",
    "those electrons which hit the cylinder tops , whose area is @xmath53 of the total , will cause see from the tops .",
    "those electrons which hit elsewhere on the notional plane will penetrate into the whisker layer and hit either the sides or the bottom surface .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath67    the sides and bottom contributions require calculation of probability to hit a side surface of the whisker . as discussed above , the probability of intersection of a side surface of the whisker can be assumed to be constant per unit distance traveled parallel to the surface ( or perpendicular to the axis of the whisker ) , which is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the distance traveled along the z - axis in the velvet layer and @xmath3 is again the angle between the z - axis and electron velocity .",
    "thus the probability of not intersecting a side surface of the whisker is given by    @xmath70    the probability to hit a whisker side is given by product of probability not hitting the tops @xmath71 times the probability to  hit a whisker side @xmath72    @xmath73    to simulate how many secondaries emitted on a side surface can reach back to free space , we need to calculate probability of emission as a function of the velocity direction . in order",
    "to describe emitted electron velocity direction we use the coordinate system that is placed at the whisker side as shown in figure [ fig : angles ] . in polar angles around z - axis , we introduce angle , @xmath74 between z - axis and emitted electron velocity and azimuthal angle , @xmath4 .",
    "we also use polar angle @xmath75 between local normal and emitted electron velocity and in this same frame , a local normal azimuthal angle @xmath76 .",
    "if we assume that the normal to the whisker surface coincides with the y - axis , the @xmath77 angle between between y - axis and emitted electron velocity is given in terms of polar angles @xmath74 and @xmath4 according to    @xmath78    the probability distribution emitted over solid angle , @xmath79 is    @xmath80    here @xmath81 is the heviside function and we accounted for the fact that emission flux is proportional to cosine of angle between of emitted electron velocity direction and normal to the surface , eq.([eq : costheta ] ) . averaging over azimuthal angle @xmath82",
    "we obtain probability of electron emission with angle @xmath74    @xmath83     is the polar angle of the primary electron .",

    "@xmath76 is the secondary azimuthal angle . ]    .",
    "cylinder is seen from tops , view aligned along @xmath69 axis . ]",
    "therefore the sey of the sides of the velvet whiskers is    @xmath86    @xmath87 is necessary to compute because the local polar angle @xmath22 depends not only on the absolute polar angle @xmath88 but also the impact parameter at which the electron strikes ( see figure [ fig : b_int ] ) ; that is an electron which hits a fiber dead - on will have @xmath89 , but an electron which hits at a glancing angle will have @xmath90 .",
    "averaging @xmath91 over this impact parameter @xmath92 gives    @xmath93    using scholtz s and vaughan s expressions for sey , this averaged sey , @xmath87 , was never more than about 30% higher than the flat value , @xmath94 . substituting equation [ eq : pfree ] into equation [ eq : gamside ] and introducing notation @xmath95 , equation [ eq : gamside ] becomes    @xmath96    similarly for the contribution from the bottom surface ,    @xmath97    or in the same notation as equation [ eq : gamsidefinal ] ,    @xmath98    _ it is apparent from equations [ eq : gamsidefinal ] and [ eq : for_gamma_bottom ] that the dimensionless parameter _ @xmath99__is the relevant parameter to characterize a see from the velvet surface .",

    "the differences are due to approximations : first , only one generation of electrons is considered analytically .",
    "second , the geometry simulated is a rectangular lattice rather than the continuous distribution of scattering centers assumed by the analytical model .",
    "the depicted simulation error derives from counting statistics , with @xmath102 . therefore stochastic counting error @xmath103",
    "having the analytic expression for the net secondary electron emission yield ( sey , @xmath65 ) given by equation [ eq : final ] allows for analysis of optimum whisker properties for reduction of @xmath65 .",
    "firstly , analysis shows that @xmath104 is a monotonically decreasing function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath105 , and therefore is a monotonically decreasing function of whisker height , see equation [ eq : for_u ] .",
    "this is expected ; because as whisker height increases , electrons instead of hitting the bottom surface would penetrate deeper into the whisker region further from the top of whisker surface .",
    "any secondary electrons produced by these electrons will have a longer distance to traverse and large probability to hit whiskers again and therefore net sey is reduced .",
    "the relative contributions from bottom and sides of whiskers is determined by value of parameter @xmath106 , as evident by comparing terms in equation [ eq : for_f ] . in the limit of high @xmath106 @xmath107the contribution of the see flux from the bottom surface into",
    "the net sey is negligible , because electrons hit a whisker near the tops with higher probability . in the opposite limit @xmath108the",
    "see flux from the bottom surface is significant , because electrons are more likely to hit the bottom surface at these conditions and these secondary electrons are more likely to escape .",
    "moreover in this limit contribution from the bottom surface is reduced for a more shallow angle , @xmath109 ; whereas contribution from side surfaces is increased for a more shallow angle , @xmath52 this is demonstrated in figure [ figfut ] .",
    "vs @xmath14 for several @xmath105 ( curves ) that determines the net sey in equation @xmath110 , including the approximation given by equation [ eq : approx ] ( blue symbols ) .",

    "is from the bottom surface and the net sey is a decreasing function of the incident angle .    in the opposite limit @xmath115 , the functional form of",
    "the sey becomes    @xmath116    which is contribution from whisker tops and sides only ( no contribution from bottom ) . as evident from equation [ eq : gamma_limit ] increasing whisker length ( @xmath7 ) above @xmath117 will not affect the sey .",
    "for the expression given by equation [ eq : gamma_limit ] we have developed an approximate expression in the form    @xmath118 .",

    "this function is depicted in figure [ figfut ] ( blue symbols ) .      in this section",
    "we investigate the velvet parameters that give sey the most reduction .",
    "figure [ figcontour ] shows sey as a function of packing density and incidence angle for given aspect ratio of whiskers .",
    "corresponding to the minimum net sey . ]    from figure [ figcontour ] it is evident that there is an optimal packing density that yields the minimum net sey for a set aspect ratio @xmath48 .",
    "indeed at large values of @xmath119 the contribution of see from the whisker tops dominates the net sey the net sey increases with the packing density . at small values of @xmath120 and large values of @xmath48 so that @xmath121 the contribution of sides dominates and @xmath122 .",
    "\\label{eq : gamma_sides}\\]]and for very small values of @xmath120 such that @xmath123 contribution of the bottom of whiskers dominates and taking appropriate limit in equation [ eq : final ] gives @xmath124that is at very low values of @xmath53 there are simply not enough whiskers for any significant number of electrons to intersect them when traversing the velvet .",
    "therefore the optimum value of whisker parameters corresponding to minimum sey is approximately given by the condition    @xmath125    investigation of figure [ figcontour ] allowed us to derive the location of the optimal @xmath53 to minimize net sey , @xmath65 for given values of @xmath126 .",
    "this optimal @xmath127 is approximately given by    @xmath128    equation [ eq : dopt ] gives agreement with 12% average error for the position of the optimal d as shown in figure [ figcontour ] .",
    "we have investigated numerically and analytically the effect of velvet surfaces on secondary electron emission ( see ) and concluded that the net secondary electron yield ( sey ) can be reduced dramatically by application of velvet to the surface .",
    "geometrical quantities of the whiskers are the whisker radius , @xmath129 , whisker height , @xmath7 , and spacing between whiskers , @xmath8 .",
    "the beneficial velvet configuration for the net sey reduction consists of high aspect ratio long whiskers ,          such that @xmath132 in this case incident electrons do not reach the bottom of the velvet and large fraction of the secondary electrons emitted from the side do not exit the velvet , because they are intersected by whiskers again .",
    "the approximate net sey is given in this case by @xmath133 .",
    "\\label{eq : gamma_limit1}\\ ] ]              in summary , using plausible values for parameters of lab - grown velvets ( @xmath137 ) , we find that velvet surfaces are a promising candidate for reducing sey by more than 50% for shallow incidence ( @xmath134 ) and more than 90% for normal incidence ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the closer to the normal is the angle of incidence , the more a long , non - dense velvet can suppress the sey . interestingly , if it is known that the incident electron flux has a _ narrow _ distribution of incident angles , one could use a velvet with whiskers oriented not normally but along that direction ; such velvet is the most efficient way to minimize sey .",
