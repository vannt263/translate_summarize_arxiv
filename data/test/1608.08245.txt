    "this provides a second characterization .    * characterization 2 : * for @xmath6 , @xmath2 is the number whose binary representation has length @xmath1 and consists of alternating ones and zeros .",

    "there are several standard methods for obtaining a closed form expression for @xmath2 .",

    "we observe that @xmath2 is even or odd exactly when @xmath1 is even or odd , respectively .",
    "why do we care about a particular sequence ? often it is because the sequence occurs as the answer to some counting problem .",
    "the oeis lists several places where the values in sequence https://oeis.org/a000975[a000975 ] occur . here",
    "are some of the more interesting .    * occurrence 1 : * @xmath2 is the number of moves needed to solve the @xmath1-ring chinese rings puzzle ( baguenaudier ) if the rings are moved one at a time .",

    "the labels on the vertices denote the positions of the 4 rings in that state , with 0 representing a ring that is off the sliding bar and 1 a ring that is on .",
    "it is easy to confirm that the state graph for the @xmath1-ring puzzle is a path of length @xmath24 from the state labeled @xmath25 to the state labeled @xmath26 .",
    "the sub - path from state @xmath25 to state @xmath27 constitutes an optimal solution of the @xmath1-ring puzzle , while the sub - path from state @xmath27 to state @xmath26 represents an optimal solution of the @xmath28-ring puzzle .",
    "the number of moves in an optimal solution to this puzzle thus satisfies characterization 3 of sequence @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ rings ] also illustrates a related occurrence of our sequence .",
    "* occurrence 2 : * @xmath2 is the distance between a string of @xmath1 zeros and a string of @xmath1 ones in the standard @xmath1-bit binary gray code .",

    "we illustrate this occurrence in figure [ dk ] , showing the @xmath30 partitions of six people into three affinity groups . for concreteness we assign the names a and b to the affinity groups of the people at the bottom left and bottom right , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we note that there are @xmath9 strings of length @xmath29 that start with ab , contain all the letters a , b , and c , and have no two adjacent letters the same .",
    "if such a string ends in either b or c , it can be wrapped into a circle to represent an affinity partition of @xmath29 people .",
    "if such a string ends in a , the a can be deleted and the shortened string will represent an affinity partition of @xmath31 people .",
    "the number of affinity partitions of @xmath29 people is thus another problem that satisfies characterization 3 of sequence @xmath0 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath2 is the number of different 3-colorings for the vertices of all triangulated @xmath32-gons if the colors of the two base vertices are fixed .",

    "we demonstrate that the answer to this question is `` yes . ''    in the somewhat peculiar language of @xcite , these numbers are the first few coefficients of the colored hilbert series giving the number of bubbles of increasing arity , first based and then nonbased , of the 2-colored suboperad @xmath167 of the 2-colored operad bubble generated by these two generators of arity 2 .    in more simple languge , a _ bubble _ is a polygon consisting of a base edge and two or more nonbase edges , with each edge either colored blue or left uncolored .",

    "the _ border _ of a bubble is its set of nonbase edges .",
    "the _ arity _ of a bubble is the number of edges in its border .",
    "the based bubbles in the 2-colored suboperad of interest start with a triangle of blue edges .",
    "new bubbles are generated by either replacing a blue border edge with two consecutive uncolored edges , or by replacing an uncolored border edge with two consecutive blue edges .",

    "see figure [ bubble ] for the based bubbles of arity 2 , 3 , and 4 in this suboperad .          1 .",
    "the number of blue edges in the border is congruent to @xmath168 ( and the number of uncolored edges in the border is thus congruent to @xmath169 ) ; and 2 .",
    "there exist 2 consecutive edges in the border that are either both blue or both uncolored .",
    "in addition , the paper @xcite gives 2-variable generating functions ( or colored hilbert series ) for based and unbased bubbles in this suboperad .",
    "unfortunately these generating functions are flawed : the numerator of the second term in the first generating function should be @xmath170 , not @xmath171 , and the numerator of the second term in the second generating function should be @xmath171 , not @xmath170 .",
    "we now produce our own count of these bubbles .",
    "let @xmath172 denote the number of strings of length @xmath1 over the alphablet @xmath173 such that the number of occurrances of the character @xmath174 is congruent to @xmath175",

    "exactly one of these strings consists of alternating @xmath174 characters and @xmath177 characters .",
    "clearly the number of strings of length @xmath1 with @xmath41 occurrences of the character @xmath174 is @xmath178 .",
    "so we have @xmath179 the restrictions on the number of @xmath174 characters and @xmath177 characters in a string imply that these counts can not be equal , so an alternating string must be of odd length .",
    "if @xmath180 the number of @xmath174 characters must be congruent to @xmath181 and the number of @xmath177 characters must be congruent to @xmath182 , so there is a unique alternating string of length @xmath1 , consisting of @xmath41 occurrences of the character @xmath174 and @xmath183 occurrences of the character @xmath177 .",
    "every based bubble in our suboperad can be constructed from a blue base and a border colored according to a string described in lemma 4 .",
    "there is one based bubble of arity 2 , and the number of based bubbles of arity @xmath1 plus the number of based bubbles of arity @xmath31 is @xmath24 .",
    "thus the number of based bubbles satisfies characterization 3 from section 1 .",
    "we conclude by illustrating an alternative approach to this counting problem : a one - to - one correspondence between the number of partitions into affinity groups described in section 2 and the based bubbles described here . to construct a bubble from an affinity group partition",
