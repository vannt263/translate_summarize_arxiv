    "thermodynamics is an established and powerful phenomenological theory in the macroscopic scale .",
    "it provides various universal results on thermodynamic processes : e.g. , the carnot efficiency limit of heat engines . in recent years",
    ", much attention has been paid to the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of quantum thermodynamics is the extension of thermodynamics to incorporate quantum effects , such as quantum coherence and entanglement .",
    "for example , there are reports that quantum coherence enhances the performance of quantum thermal machines ( such as quantum heat engines and refrigerators ) @xcite .    lasers ( and masers ) are regarded as examples of quantum heat engines and have been studied in the context of the quantum thermodynamics @xcite . a typical setup of a laser system as a heat engine is shown in fig .  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the main system is a cavity quantum electrodynamics system , which consists of cavity photons and matter .",
    "the matter is thermally pumped by heat baths .",
    "the output of the engine is obtained in a form of the radiation from the cavity . below a certain laser threshold , incoherent light",
    "is mainly observed in the radiation . above the threshold , by contrast , coherent light is mainly observed . in this way",
    ", the system emits both coherent light ( such as a laser ) and incoherent light ( such as thermal radiation ) .",
    "it is noted that the energy transfer by coherent radiation is `` systematic '' whereas that by incoherent one is `` random . ''",
    "this leads to an intuitive conjecture that the coherent and incoherent parts of the radiation respectively correspond to work and heat .",
    "however , so far in many studies on lasers as quantum heat engines , all the energy transfer by the radiation have been calculated as work ( an exception is ref .",
    "one should carefully define the work and heat in the radiation ( output of the engine ) when discussing quantum thermodynamics .",
    "otherwise , for example , one sometimes overestimates the efficiency of a heat engine .",
    "decomposing the radiation energy into work and heat should be particularly crucial at around the threshold because coherent and incoherent parts equally contribute to the radiation .",
    "in the present paper , we propose an appropriate method of decomposing the radiation energy into work and heat in the framework of quantum master equation ( qme ) .",
    "we formulate the method by investigating the time evolution of the system ( called photon drain ) that receives the radiation from the cavity .",
    "we definitely identify the systematic ( work ) and random ( heat ) energy transfers based on the time evolution .",
    "( for a similar but different approach , see ref .",
    "our main result shows that the above intuitive conjecture is correct : the coherent radiation attributes to the work whereas the incoherent one attributes to the heat .",
    "we consider a total system which is composed of a cavity quantum electrodynamics system , heat baths and a photon drain . in the present paper",
    ", we refer to cavity quantum electrodynamics system , heat bath(s ) , and photon drain simply as cqed , bath(s ) , and drain , respectively .",
    "we show a schematic example of the setup in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] . for simplicity , we assume that the cavity is single mode . the baths",
    "interact with the matter part of the cqed and induce excitation and decay of the cqed .",
    "the drain , on the other hand , interacts with the photon part of the cqed and receives the photons out of the cqed through the cavity loss .",
    "we also irradiate weak coherent field , which we call symmetry breaking ( sb ) field , to the cavity photon mode to have a non - vanishing expectation value of photonic amplitude in lasing situations . in the present paper",
    "we assume that the baths and drain are so large that their states are almost unchanged .",
    "in particular , the drain is always in the ( almost ) vacuum state .",
    "we consider the steady state of the cqed in this setup .",
    "that is , we investigate the cqed as a continuous heat engine @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of the cqed .",
    "its concrete form is irrelevant to our formulation .",
    "@xmath2 is the interaction hamiltonian between the cavity mode and sb field : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity mode , @xmath6 is the amplitude of the sb field , and @xmath7 is the frequency of the sb field .",
    "we set @xmath7 equal to the frequency of cqed photon amplitude in the rest frame .",
    "@xmath8 is the free hamiltonian of the baths and @xmath9 is the interaction hamiltonian between the ( matter part of ) cqed and baths .",
    "@xmath10 is the free hamiltonian of the drain : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath14-th mode in the drain .",
    "@xmath15 is the interaction hamiltonian between the cqed and drain : @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the coupling strength .",
    "we also define the spectral function of the drain : @xmath18    as seen in the above , the explicit form of the hamiltonians are specified only for @xmath2 , @xmath10 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the forms of the other hamiltonians are irrelevant to the present study although there are some ( weak ) restrictions on them .",
    "one of the restrictions is that the hamiltonians other than @xmath2 commute with the excitation number of the total system @xmath19 : @xmath20 = 0 , \\label{excitation_conservation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 c , b , d , c - b , and c - d .",
    "note that @xmath19 is defined by the sum of the excitation numbers in the individual systems : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the excitation number of the matter part in the cqed ) .",
    "we here mention the reason to introduce the sb field . if we analyze the setup without the sb field , the photonic amplitude ( expectation value of @xmath4 ) vanishes in the steady state even in lasing situations because the system has @xmath26 symmetry ( excitation number conservation ) as assumed in eq .",
    "( [ excitation_conservation ] ) .",
    "however , as we will see later , the photonic amplitude plays a crucial role in our results in the present paper . for this reason ,",
    "finite value of the amplitude is necessary in our formulation , and this is why we introduce the sb field .    for the convenience of the theoretical analysis , we transform the frame from the rest one to the rotating one with the frequency @xmath7 .",
    "we define an operator @xmath27 in the rotating frame by @xmath28 for any operator @xmath29 in the rest frame . in this transformation",
    ", we have a time - independent total hamiltonian : @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 the other hamiltonians are unchanged in this transformation because they commutes with @xmath19 as assumed in eq .",
    "( [ excitation_conservation ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we describe the system in the rotating frame unless otherwise specified , and omit the tildes for notational simplicity .",
    "we also employ the schrdinger picture .",
    "the time - evolution equation for the total system is given by the von neumann equation : @xmath32 , \\label{vonneumann_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the density operator of the total system in the rotating frame . by applying the standard born - markov approximation @xcite to this equation",
    ", we obtain a qme for the cqed : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the density operator of the cqed , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the traces over the hilbert spaces of the baths and drain , respectively .",
    "the liouvillian @xmath38 is composed of three parts : @xmath39 where the superoperators @xmath40 and @xmath41 act on any operator @xmath42 of cqed as follows : @xmath43 , \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{l}_{\\rm d } \\hat{o}_{\\rm c } & = - \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\bigl ( \\hat{c}^\\dag \\hat{c } \\hat{o}_{\\rm c } + \\hat{o}_{\\rm c } \\hat{c}^\\dag \\hat{c } - 2 \\hat{c } \\hat{o}_{\\rm c } \\hat{c}^\\dag \\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 is the liouvillian due to the baths ( explicit form is irrelevant ) . here , @xmath45 is the cavity loss rate .",
    "in deriving the qme ( [ qme_cqed ] ) , we have made several assumptions .",
    "the first one is weak couplings between the cqed and baths and between the cqed and drain , so that we have used a second - order perturbation theory ( born approximation ) in the couplings .",
    "the second is that the time scale of the cqed is sufficiently slower than those of the baths and drain , so that we have used the markov approximation .",
    "the third is that the drain is in the almost vacuum state .",
    "the fourth one is the wide - band limit of the drain spectral function : @xmath46 ( constant ) .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the steady state of the cqed @xmath47 in the rotating frame .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 is unique and stable ; i.e. , the steady state is realized after sufficiently long time for any initial state .",
    "mathematically this means that zero is a non - degenerate eigenvalue of @xmath38 , its corresponding eigenvector is @xmath47 , and the real parts of the other eigenvalues are negative .      in the present setup , the cavity photons are leaked through the cavity loss due to the drain .",
    "thus we can define the radiation energy flow as the unit - time energy loss due to the drain : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the trace over the hilbert space of the cqed . in the persent paper",
    "we use the sign convention such that energy flows ( including work and heat flows ) are positive when delivered from the cqed to the drain .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ derivaton_energy_flow ] , we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents the `` heisenberg picture '' of any cqed operator @xmath42 , and @xmath52 is the steady - state average .",
    "note that we define the adjoint @xmath53 of a superoperator @xmath54 such that @xmath55 = { \\rm tr}[(\\mathcal{s}^\\dag \\hat{o}_1)^\\dag \\hat{o}_2]$ ] holds for any pair of operators @xmath56 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to decompose the radiation energy flow @xmath57 into the work and heat flows .",
    "it is difficult , however , to find a criterion for the decomposition from eqs .",
    "( [ j_e_cd ] ) and ( [ j_e_cd_variant ] ) .",
    "intuitively , the work and heat are respectively the `` systematic '' and `` random '' part of energy transfer .",
    "therefore we expect that , for the decomposition , it is necessary to investigate how the drain receives the energy flow .    in order to investigate it , we need to know the time evolution of the drain interacting with the cqed plus the baths . here",
    "we can use a qme for the drain to describe the time evolution of the drain by regarding the cqed plus baths as an environment and by eliminating their degrees of freedom .",
    "this is possible because we have assumed that the interaction between the cqed and drain is so weak that we can use a born - type approximation .",
    "the starting point in deriving a qme for the drain is the following qme for the composite system composed of the cqed and drain : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the density operator of the composite system , @xmath60 $ ] , and @xmath61 $ ] for any operator @xmath62 of the composite system .",
    "we can derive the qme  ( [ cqed+drain ] ) for the composite system as follows .",
    "we first consider the cqed plus baths , and eliminate the baths degrees of freedom in the standard born - markov approximation to obtain a qme for the cqed .",
    "after that , we connect it to the drain to obtain eq .",
    "( [ cqed+drain ] ) .",
    "we may justify the qme  ( [ cqed+drain ] ) in the condition of weak coupling for @xmath63 ( otherwise this is not justified @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , if we eliminate the drain s degrees of freedom from eq .",
    "( [ cqed+drain ] ) in the born - markov approximation , we recover the qme  ( [ qme_cqed ] ) for the cqed .    in order to derive a qme for the drain from eq .",
    "( [ cqed+drain ] ) , we eliminate the degrees of freedom of the cqed . however , in contrast to the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ qme_cqed ] ) , we can not justify to use the markov approximation in the derivation of a qme for the drain .",
    "this is because we have assumed that the time scale of the drain is much faster than that of the cqed in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ qme_cqed ] ) .",
    "therefore we have to describe the drain by a non - markovian time - evolution equation .",
    "one of the methods of describing the non - markovian dynamics is a time - convolutionless ( tcl ) qme .",
    "in particular , we employ a tcl - qme valid up to the second order in the coupling between the cqed and drain .",
    "the second order is necessary and sufficient to be consistent with the coupling order in the qme  ( [ qme_cqed ] ) for the cqed .",

    "@xmath69 is the steady - state - averaged interaction , and @xmath70 is the initial time .",
    "in deriving the tcl - qme  ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) , we have assumed that the initial state of the composite system is given by @xmath71 .",
    "we shall show the detail of the derivation of the tcl - qme  ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) in appendix  [ derivation_tclqme ] .",
    "we note that @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively describe the hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian dynamics of the drain . as a result , we can definitely separate the systematic and random parts of the drain s time evolution ( due to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively ) . furthermore , eq .",
    "( [ kw ] ) implies that the operator of the drain energy is @xmath74 .",
    "we now construct a method of decomposing the radiation energy flow into work and heat flows .      we have assumed that the drain is almost in the vacuum state in the derivation of the qme  ( [ qme_cqed ] ) for the cqed .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to set the initial state of the drain to the vacuum state @xmath75 in calculating the unit - time energy gain @xmath76 of the drain with the qme  ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) for the drain .",
    "we thus define the energy flow @xmath76 by @xmath77 \\rho_{\\rm d}(t ) \\bigr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the solution of the qme  ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) with the initial condition @xmath79 .",
    "note that we define @xmath76 independently of @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ j_e_cd ] ) ( although we will show later that these are equal to each other ) .",
    "we decompose this energy flow into two parts : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 we may regard @xmath82 as the work flow because it is the energy gain due to the hamiltonian ( systematic ) dynamics . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath83 is the heat flow because it is the energy gain due to the non - hamiltonian ( random ) dynamics .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with that in the thermodynamics of open quantum systems weakly coupled to thermal baths @xcite .    we may justify this decomposition also from the viewpoint of the rest frame as follows . in the rest frame the hamiltonian ( energy operator ) of the drain @xmath84",
    "is modulated in time through the photonic amplitude @xmath85 of the cqed .",
    "hence we may interpret the cqed as an external agent which varies the control parameter in the drain",
    ". then the unit - time change of the drain energy ( which equals to @xmath76 ) has two contributions : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the drain s state in the rest frame .",
    "the first term is attributed to the controllable change of the hamiltonian itself , whereas the second is to the uncontrollable change of the drain s state .",
    "therefore we may interpret the first and second terms as the changes in work and heat , respectively .",
    "in fact , as shown in appendix  [ proof_equivalence ] , the following relations hold : @xmath88 we also note that this interpretation is consistent with that in the thermodynamics of small systems @xcite .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ derivation_work_heat_flows ] , we can write the flows in more explicit forms : @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "these forms , which give a practical method of the decomposition , are the main result of the present paper . here",
    "we make four remarks on this result .",
    "the first one is that the energy conservation law does hold .",
    "we can easily show this law in the form of energy balance equation , @xmath91 , by comparing @xmath57 given by eq .",
    "( [ j_e_cd_variant ] ) and @xmath80 with eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow_explicit ] ) and ( [ heat_flow_explicit ] ) .",
    "this result supports the utilization of the qme  ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) in defining the work and heat flows .",
    "we also note that this law is a local version of the first law of thermodynamics , in the sense that this law is associated with the local interface between the cqed and drain .",
    "( of course , the global energy conservation law also holds in the present setup . )",
    "the second is that the work and heat respectively correspond to coherent ( finite photon amplitude ) and incoherent parts of the energy transfer from the cqed to the drain .",
    "this gives an intuitive understanding of the decomposition .",
    "the third is that the explicit forms [ eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow_explicit ] ) and ( [ heat_flow_explicit ] ) ] are independent of time @xmath66 although they seem to be dependent on @xmath66 in the definitions [ eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow ] ) and ( [ heat_flow ] ) ] .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that we are investigating a continuous heat engine in the steady - state situation of the cqed .",
    "the final remark is that we need not use the qme  ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) in the practical calculation of work and heat flows . from the qme  ( [ qme_cqed ] ) for the cqed , we can obtain all the information necessary to calculate them by using eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow_explicit ] ) and ( [ heat_flow_explicit ] ) .",
    "we furthermore find relations between the ( total , work , and heat ) energy flows and the photoluminescence spectrum .",
    "we define the photoluminescence spectrum @xmath92 of the steady - state cqed as @xmath93 here , the factor @xmath94 appears because the steady state and @xmath95 are in the rotating frame .",
    "the spectrum @xmath92 corresponds to the steady - state average of the unit - time and unit - frequency photon number observed in the drain .",
    "the fourier transform of the above equation gives the correlation function : @xmath96 by using this equation , we rewrite the individual terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ j_e_cd_variant ] ) as @xmath97 we thus obtain the relation between the total energy flow @xmath57 and the spectrum @xmath92 : @xmath98 we may intuitively understand this relation : the sum of the energy @xmath99 multiplied by its radiation strength @xmath92 gives the energy flow @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , we may decompose the spectrum into the coherent peak and the rest ( incoherent part ) as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 from these equations with eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow_explicit ] ) and ( [ heat_flow_explicit ] ) , we obtain the relations between work and heat flows and the spectra : @xmath102 again , we may intuitively understand these relations : the sum of the energy @xmath99 multiplied by its coherent ( incoherent ) radiation strength @xmath103 [ @xmath104 gives the work ( heat ) flow @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "in the present paper we have proposed a method , eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow_explicit ] ) and ( [ heat_flow_explicit ] ) , of decomposing the radiation energy into the work and heat .",
    "this method provides with a reliable foundation of the intuition that the coherent part is the work while the incoherent part is the heat .",
    "the key point in deriving this method is to explicitly consider the time evolution of the drain in the qme   ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) to investigate in what forms the drain receives the radiation energy from the cqed .",
    "we note that the relevant assumptions in the setup for our formulation are : ( i ) the cavity is single mode , ( ii ) the drain is a system of the free electromagnetic field ( @xmath105 ) and is in almost vacuum state , ( iii ) the interaction between the cqed and drain is weak and given by @xmath106 , ( iv ) the baths interact only with the matter part of the cqed , ( v ) the photonic amplitude rotates with a single frequency ( like a single - mode laser ) , and ( vi ) the excitation number conserves without the sb field . in this sense ,",
    "the decomposition method in the present paper is rather general and widely applicable .",
    "further extension to multimode cases [ concerning ( i ) and ( v ) ] is a future issue .    in theoretical situations without the sb field",
    ", we can not calculate @xmath82 with eq .",
    "( [ work_flow_explicit ] ) since @xmath107 vanishes .",
    "one promising way to extend the decomposition method to such cases is to use the relations to the photoluminescence spectrum @xmath92 .",
    "the spectrum usually has a very sharp peak above the laser threshold even without the sb field although it is not a strict delta function but has a narrow width due to dephasing .",
    "this fact would allow us to decompose the spectrum into coherent and incoherent parts , @xmath103 and @xmath108 .",
    "then we may calculate the work and heat flows with eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow_spectrum ] ) and ( [ heat_flow_spectrum ] ) .",
    "this also suggests that one may estimate work and heat flows in experiments by measuring @xmath92 . at present , however , it is not clear how to unambiguously define the coherent and incoherent parts of the spectrum , and this is also a future issue .",
    "finally , we make a remark that the decomposition depends on the `` scales of description . ''",
    "when we describes a certain system as a thermodynamic system , we often choose a scale of description , which separates the system of interest from the rest ( environment ) . in the framework of the present paper ,",
    "we have used the qmes ( [ qme_cqed ] ) and ( [ tclqme_drain ] ) , which implies that we have chosen the scale that sets a description boundary between the cqed and drain .",
    "then we have obtained eqs .",
    "( [ work_flow_explicit ] ) and ( [ heat_flow_explicit ] ) as the decomposition method into work and heat .",
    "however , if we do not set the description boundary between them and use the original von neumann equation ( [ vonneumann_eq ] ) or the starting - point qme ( [ cqed+drain ] ) , all the effect of the coupling between them is described by the hamiltonian dynamics , so that all the energy transfer between them is regarded as work .",
    "this illustrates that the decomposition into work and heat depends on where we place the description boundary .",
    "this dependence is inevitable when investigating dynamics in smaller scales .",
    "we also note that this is equivalent to the statement , `` each description scale has its own definition of heat , '' in the stochastic energetics @xcite .",
