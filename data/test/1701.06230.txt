    "up to now , scanning gate microscopy ( sgm ) has been successfully used to image local electron transport in various mesoscopic systems . in early applications",
    ", sgm probed the interference effects produced by microscopic disorder in graphene ,  @xcite and it was later applied to image electron - hole puddles originating from extrinsic local doping .",
    "@xcite in the later experiment ,  @xcite the tip was coated with a dielectric and placed directly in contact with graphene .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that afm topography scans could be performed simultaneously with sgm scans , and the tip could be additionally used to clean the sample .",
    "scanning technique was used in ref .   to study the spatial inhomogeneity of the local neutrality point , and to measure the efficiency of intentionally embedding ( writing ) charges in graphene .",
    "@xcite tip - dependent resistance map of a narrow quantum point contact ( qpc ) , presented in ref .  , revealed a significant resistance increase when the tip was placed directly above the sample .",
    "the technique is also suitable for the investigation of localization effects .",
    "for example , concentric conductance halos were observed in sgm maps scanned around localized states in graphene quantum dots ,  @xcite narrow constrictions ,  @xcite and enhanced conductance was reported in narrow nanoribbons .",
    "@xcite scanning gate experiments in quantum point contacts were simulated in ref .  .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the scanning gate experiments of the magnetic focusing devices reported in refs .  .",
    "before , similar magnetic focusing measurements were performed on semiconductor two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in parallel with the scanning technique .",
    "@xcite we model our device using both quantum and classical transport theory .",
    "previously , classical simulation of such a focusing device was done in ref .  , and focusing without sgm tip was studied in ref .  . a recent paper by kolasiski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was the first to reproduce some of the experimental findings by applying a full quantum approach .",
    "here , we implement the multi - terminal landauer - bttiker formalism to calculate the non - local resistances .",
    "we additionally compare the resistance maps of 4-terminal and 6-terminal devices for different combinations of voltage probes .",
    "due to the large size of the device , as compared to the electron wavelength , most of the simulated effects can already be captured by the computationally less demanding classical model . in respect to that , we confirm that the classical billiard model can be successfully used to describe transport of relativistic carriers in the presence of inhomogeneous potentials , if the linear graphene spectrum is properly implemented .",
    "our analysis of simulated sgm maps confirms and expands on some of the experimental observations reported in refs .  .",
    "we consider both positively and negatively charged tip , as well as a tip acting in the mixed regime .",
    "we show that the main resistance feature ( e.g.  the spatial area of reduced resistance ) can be explained by considering geometric relations between the device boundaries , the tip position , and the circular cyclotron orbits .",
    "we also found that the finite width of the focusing leads can not be neglected .",
    "one of the novel results is that the sgm tip is mainly acting on a set of trajectories that directly connect the injector lead with the tip position .",
    "we show that the repelling tip leaves a shadow behind itself , which is mainly situated in areas delimited by two direct cyclotron orbits that connect the tip with the two corners of the injector lead .",
    "the specific shape of the tip shadow , which depends on the relative position between the tip and the injector lead , determines the shape of the low resistance region .",
    "therefore , at the first focusing peak , the tip is imaging a specific subset of direct trajectories connecting the two focusing leads .",
    "this only applies for a repelling tip , or a tip operating in a mixed regime ( repelling and focusing ) . for a tip acting as a focusing lens",
    ", the produced sgm maps do not show any significant change in the resistance , therefore they do not provide much useful information in characterization of transport .",
    "we additionally compare results between a 4-terminal and a 6-terminal device , and find them to be very similar , although the later induces some asymmetry in the resistance maps .",
    "the reason for this similarity is because the resistance is mostly determined by the transmission function between the two focusing leads . in that sense , we confirm the approach taken in ref .  , which considered only transmission functions and not resistances .",

    "[ figt ] ) .",
    "the focusing tip leaves a trail of enhanced current instead of a shadow , as seen in the case of a repelling tip ( compare insets 10 and 15 ) . in the last row ,",
    "a tip in the mixed regime shows a much darker shadow behind itself as compared to the repelling tip .",
    "the mixed nature of the tip manifests itself in a current profile , where some of the current that manages to tunnel through the potential induced by the tip , exits focused on the other side .",
    "although previous resistance maps capture the main features reported in the experiment  @xcite ( e.g.  they show semicircular areas where the resistance is reduced , and these areas coincide with the focusing trajectories ) , they posses some additional features which were not observed experimentally .",
    "the major difference is that the simulated resistance maps are symmetric with respect to mirror reflection along the middle line of the system ( the yellow - dashed line in the first row of fig .",
    "[ figsgm ] ) .",
    "the cyclotron orbits imaged in the experiment  @xcite were not perfectly symmetric with respect to this transformation .",
    "this asymmetry could originate from several different sources .",
    "for example , it could come from local impurity charges trapped in the sample . due to the electric forces coming from these charges , transmitted electrons",
    "could divert from their ideal circular trajectories .",
    "although this is a possible explanations for the asymmetry , it is unlikely in samples sandwiched between h - bn , hence here we will discuss other possible sources .",
    "our initial assumption was that the asymmetry could originate from a difference in widths of the two focusing leads ( the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 lead ) .",
    "we tested this by changing the width of the @xmath1 lead , and recalculating some of the resistance maps of fig .",
    "[ figsgm ] . using a wider ( @xmath95 ) , or a narrower ( @xmath96 )",
    "@xmath1 lead did not significantly change the symmetry of the resistance maps and can not account for what is observed in the experiment .",
    "our second assumption was that the asymmetry originates from an asymmetry in the tip - induced potential .",
    "an uneven distribution of charges on top of the tip , or a tip not properly aligned to the vertical ( @xmath11 ) axis would create an anisotropic image - charge density , and consequently an anisotropic tip potential .",
    "we tested this by modifying the eccentricity of an elliptic charge density , but the obtained resistance maps were not significantly modified . in general , we could not reproduce the measured resistance asymmetries in an impurity - free four - terminal device .    since the original experiment was performed in a six - terminal device , in order to check how resistance maps change for different configurations of the voltage measuring probes , we additionally add two new leads to our system .",
    "we label these new leads as lead 5 , and lead 6 , and they are placed opposite to the two focusing leads .",
    "our system is now a symmetric , six - terminal hall bar often used in standard quantum hall measurements .",
    "( color online ) sgm resistance maps of a six - terminal device for different measurement configurations : @xmath97 ( first row ) , @xmath98 ( second row ) , @xmath99 ( third row ) , and for different magnetic fields ( columns ) .",
    "leads colored in violet are source and drain leads for the current , and leads colored in orange are voltage probes ( leads colored in white were not used in the calculations ) .",
    "global electron density is @xmath100 , and maximal tip - induced change in the charge density is @xmath101 .",
    "all resistances are obtained using the quantum ( tight - binding ) approach .",
    "resistance @xmath102 is calculated and subtracted from every inset , similarly as in fig .",
    "[ figsgm].,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    resistance maps of this system are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_6term ] , for three different cases .",
    "the first row presents data for the same probe configuration as in fig .",
    "[ figsgm ] , but now with two new leads included . when compared with fig .",
    "[ figsgm ] , the new leads do not significantly modify the calculated resistances .",
    "the region of suppressed resistance is still delimited with two cyclotron orbits connecting the outer and inner corners of the two focusing leads ( violet and green curves in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig_6term ] ) , and maximal resistance suppression is still determined by the orbits connecting the middle lines of the two focusing leads ( the white curves ) . the second row in fig .",
    "[ fig_6term ] corresponds to probe configuration actually used in the experiment .",
    "@xcite a slight asymmetry is introduced by keeping the current probes ( leads 1 and 2 ) , and changing the voltage probes ( from measuring @xmath103 , to measuring @xmath104 ) .",
    "although the suppressed region is still fairly symmetric , an asymmetry is evident if we compare upper and lower parts of the @xmath90-maps .",
    "the third row shows @xmath90-maps obtained by measuring the voltage across the device ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "a clear asymmetry is evident for lower fields . in general",
    ", the measured voltage depends mostly on how much of the electron current is scattered into the voltage leads . for stronger fields ,",
    "most of the current is located away from the new leads , on the lower edge , and therefore the scattering is negligible .    since we demonstrated that most of the transport in this system is determined by considering electron orbits that connect the @xmath0 lead with the tip , the interface between the focusing leads and the main region might also play a significant role . here , we considered the focusing leads connected to the main region with perfect ( 90@xmath106 degrees ) corners , but due to an imperfect etching , these corners might be more smooth , thus allowing for some additional effects ( e.g.  new direct trajectories from the @xmath0 lead to the tip ) .",
    "[ sec_six_terminal ]",
    "to summarize , we performed simulations of the scanning gate measurements in graphene magnetic focusing devices .",
    "two methods ( quantum and classical ) were used to obtain the system transmissions .",
    "these transmissions were then applied in the ( multi - terminal ) landauer - bttiker formula to calculate the device resistances . in order to perform the quantum simulations , the graphene tight - binding hamiltonian needed to be properly scaled .    in case without the sgm tip , the focusing resistance @xmath107 reveals three focusing peaks , which could be connected with three cyclotron radii .",
    "these radii were calculated using the distance between the two focusing leads , but only after including the finite widths of the focusing leads .",
    "depending on the voltage on the back - gate and the charge accumulated on the tip , we differentiate between six different regimes in which the tip can operate .",
    "three out of these six regimes are unique . in general , due to the large system size , all the features of the resistance maps are captured with the classical model , and can be explained by tip influencing the direct cyclotron orbits coming from the @xmath0 lead .",
    "our results show that the largest change in the resistance is obtained for tip operating in the mixed regime ( simultaneously repelling and focusing electrons ) .",
    "the spatial asymmetry in experimentally obtained @xmath90-maps can be partially explained by the specific configuration of the voltage probes , but we do not rule out other sources , such as charged impurities or edge imperfections produced during the etching process .",
