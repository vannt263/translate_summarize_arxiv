    "star clusters are vital laboratories for testing theories of stellar dynamics and stellar evolution  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the globular clusters orbiting the milky way constitute a sample of about @xmath0 evolved stellar systems with ages @xmath1 years .",
    "these provide useful constraints on the long term evolution of clusters but information about the paths which led to these end states can only be inferred via comparisons with the end points of numerical cluster simulations . in contrast , the system of rich star clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) includes clusters of comparable mass to galactic globular clusters but which span the entire age range from less than @xmath2 years ( e.g. r 136 ) to about @xmath3 years ( e.g. ngc 2019 ) .",
    "this allows us to observe massive star clusters at various epochs in their evolution and makes it possible to identify evolutionary trends , under the assumption that the external processes affecting cluster evolution have not changed significantly over the lifetime of the lmc . with this aim in mind ,",
    "hst project go7307  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) obtained deep images of four pairs of lmc clusters . within each selected pair",
    "the clusters are approximately coeval , have similar masses and metallicities and lie at comparable radii from the lmc centre but differ significantly in other properties such as core radius .",
    "the pairs range in age from about @xmath4 years up to @xmath3 years .",
    "the youngest clusters ( ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 ) are old enough to have expelled all their residual gas and so are pure systems .    fig .",
    "[ fig : lmccores ] shows a plot of the observed core radii of star clusters in the lmc as a function of their ages , with the clusters in the go7307 hst sample identified by name .",
    "there is a clear trend that the spread in core radius is an increasing function of cluster age .",
    "this trend was first identified by  @xcite from ground - based images and was recently confirmed by  @xcite using hst archive data .",
    "@xcite calculated core radii for @xmath5 lmc clusters in a uniform manner with the aim of obtaining an unbiased data set .",
    "they discuss in some detail the uncertainties in the data and conclude that selection effects are not responsible for the observed trend .",
    "they suggest , as  @xcite had earlier argued , that the increased spread in core radius is an evolutionary phenomenon : all clusters formed with relatively small core radii ( @xmath6 pc ) and subsequently some clusters experienced core expansion while others did not .",
    "@xcite discuss the possibility that inter - cluster variations in the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) could have produced the observed spread in core radius .",
    "they point out that mass loss from the increased numbers of massive stars found in clusters with imfs flatter than the standard salpeter imf could lead to core expansion of the observed magnitude on a timescale of about @xmath7 years . as  @xcite notes , however , the imf slope required to explain the largest core radii would lead to disruption of the clusters on a timescale of a few @xmath8 years . more directly , based on a detailed observational analysis of the clusters in the go7307 hst sample ,  @xcite",
    "have shown that the slopes of their luminosity functions are similar to each other within the observational uncertainties , strongly suggesting that their imfs were very similar down to stellar masses of about @xmath9m@xmath10 .",
    "the absence of inter - cluster population variations implies that stellar evolutionary mass loss can not be invoked to explain the observations .",
    "as a star cluster evolves , encounters lead to a redistribution of energy among the stars .",
    "heavier stars and binaries acquire lower velocities , on average , and sink towards the cluster core .",
    "this process of mass segregation could enhance the heating effect of a population of primordial binaries because the binaries would tend to fall to the centre where encounters occur more frequently",
    ". observations of young clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical simulations of star formation  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that so - called primordial mass segregation can also result from the cluster formation process .",
    "@xcite have shown that there is strong evidence for mass segregation in all the young and intermediate - age clusters in the go7307 sample .",
    "further , the amount of mass segregation appears to be similar in all clusters and can not therefore account for differences in the cluster core radii .    the aim of this paper is to investigate , by means of simulations , whether dynamical processes could give rise to the observed core radius  age relation . in this context , the pair of clusters ngc 1868 and ngc 1831 are of particular interest .",
    "these clusters have very similar ages and metallicities and their masses differ by at most a factor of two  ( see table  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ fig : lmccores ] shows , the core radius of ngc 1831 is almost three times larger than that of ngc 1868 .",
    "given that the cluster ages are only around @xmath11myr any process which has affected the core radii must be capable of producing significant evolution even on this relatively short time scale . in this paper , we consider the dynamical effects of ( 1 ) variations in the external tidal field experienced by the clusters and ( 2 ) differences in the initial numbers of dynamically active binary stars in the clusters .",
    "given that the crossing times at the half - mass radii of these clusters are about @xmath12 yrs and the times to orbit the lmc are about the same order of magnitude , it is reasonable to suppose that either of these processes could have begun to produce observable effects on cluster structure on the relevant time scale .    during the past decade ,",
    "numerical simulations of star clusters have become increasingly realistic owing to dramatic increases in computational speeds and significant improvements in programming algorithms  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the code used in this paper incorporates the stellar evolution models of  @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to analyse the output from the simulations in an identical manner to that used for observational data , thus allowing meaningful confrontation of models with observations .",
    "this is particularly important when discussing cluster properties such as core radius because the relation between the theoretical and observational definitions of this quantity depend on the conversion between the mass function and luminosity function of the cluster stars . for a real cluster",
    "this conversion is non - trivial because it depends on , among other quantities , the cluster metallicity and is further complicated by the possible presence of mass segregation  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper ,",
    "all comparisons between models and observations are made in terms of directly observable properties .    in the interests of clarity , we include here a note on the definition of the core radius .",
    "as  @xcite discuss , theoreticians , numerical simulators and observers assign different meanings to the term `` core radius '' , reflecting the quantity of greatest relevance to their purpose . in theoretical work",
    ", the core radius @xmath13 refers to the natural length scale of the system under study , for example the scale radius of the widely used  @xcite profile .",
    "the operational definition of the core radius commonly used in discussions of @xmath14 simulations is that of the density radius @xmath15 .",
    "this is the density - weighted average of the distance of each star from the density centre  @xcite , where the local density at each star is estimated from the mass within a sphere containing the star s six nearest neighbours and the density centre is defined as the density - weighted mean position of the stars .",
    "observationally , since the available information is either in the form of cluster surface brightness profiles or luminosities of individual stars instead of mass densities and stellar masses , the core radius @xmath16 corresponds to the radius at which the projected surface brightness falls to half its central value . in the case of a cluster of equal - mass stars in equilibrium",
    ", there is generally a well - defined relation between @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "for example , for a  @xcite model it is straightforward to show that @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that during the evolution of the cluster this relation is not static and that there is no general relation between @xmath15 and either @xmath13 or @xmath16 . in this paper",
    ", we use the term `` core radius '' exclusively to refer to the observational quantity @xmath16 . in section",
    "[ sec : tides_discussion ] we will compare the evolution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in order to emphasize the care which must be taken in comparing observations with simulations .     of lmc star clusters as a function of age .",
    "the clusters in the go7307 hst sample are identified by name , and matched pairs are joined by dotted lines .",
    "( following fig .  1 of @xcite",
    ", data taken from @xcite).,width=317 ]    in section  [ sec : nbody ] we describe briefly the code used in the simulations , as well as the pipeline used to calculate observational properties of the simulated clusters .",
    "section  [ sec : tides ] considers the effects of time variation of an external tidal field on the evolution of the cluster core radius while section  [ sec : binfrac ] deals with clusters moving in a steady tidal field but with different initial binary fractions . in section",
    "[ sec : bintide ] we investigate the combined effect of both mechanisms by studying binary - rich clusters in a time - varying tidal field and the results of these simulations are discussed in the context of the lmc clusters in section  [ sec : bintidedisc ] . finally in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarise our conclusions .",
    ".summary of runs performed .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the initial number of stars , total stellar mass and primordial fraction of hard binaries , respectively .",
    "the clusters were all simulated in the tidal field of a point mass representing the lmc , and each simulation ran until time @xmath22 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     simulations are a very valuable tool in the study of star clusters because they allow many different processes to be studied with a minimum of simplifying assumptions .",
    "the simulations discussed below were performed using the nbody4 code  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) running on the harp-3 and grape-6 special purpose computers  @xcite at the institute of astronomy , cambridge and on a grape-6 board at the american museum of natural history .",
    "the nbody4 code uses the 4th order hermite integration scheme to follow the orbits of the cluster stars and utilises state - of - the - art regularisation schemes  @xcite for the accurate and efficient treatment of the internal motion of binary and higher - order subsystems .",
    "it also incorporates a full set of stellar evolution models , in the form of parameterized functions , which are used to follow the evolution of single stars and binaries  @xcite .",
    "of particular importance to the present study is the treatment of mass loss .",
    "any gas which is lost from an evolving star and is not accreted on to a binary companion is assumed to leave the cluster instantaneously , thereby reducing the depth of the cluster potential well .",
    "a realistic treatment of mass loss is therefore essential to allow the study of the evolution of such cluster properties as the core radius .    within the code",
    "the equations of motion are integrated in scaled units such that @xmath23 and the total mass and virial radius of the cluster are also set to unity  @xcite . for a star cluster in virial equilibrium",
    "the initial energy in these units is @xmath24 and the crossing time is @xmath25 .",
    "given the total mass of the cluster in solar masses and an appropriately chosen length scale ( which determines the conversion from length units to physical units ) it is straightforward to obtain the conversion factors for time and velocity from units to myr and @xmath26 , respectively .    in order to facilitate direct comparison of the results of our simulations with the observed data , we determine the core radius for each model cluster using the same processing pipeline as that used by  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the stellar data from the model clusters ( in the form of position and luminosity information for each member star ) are binned radially to obtain a projected surface brightness profile .",
    "the three - parameter model  @xcite @xmath27 is then fitted to the cluster profile . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the central surface brightness , @xmath29 determines the fall - off of the surface brightness profile at large radii and @xmath16 is related to the length scale @xmath30 via @xmath31 .",
    "full details of the fitting procedure used and discussion of the associated uncertainties are presented in  @xcite . in order to reduce the numerical noise due to the small number of stars in our simulated clusters",
    "we observe each cluster along three perpendicular lines of sight and obtain the median core radius from these three estimates .",
    "this helps to reduce the impact of individual bright stars which might otherwise skew the core radius estimation .",
    "further , each run is performed four times using different random realisations of the initial cluster model and the results are averaged in order to ensure the robustness of any observed trends .",
    "initially , all the model clusters are generated according to a  @xcite density law @xmath32 following the prescription of  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath33 is the plummer length scale and @xmath34 is the central mass density .",
    "observations of the young clusters in the lmc show that they do not appear to be tidally limited  @xcite . in this case , the plummer profile is a reasonable model to use for the initial density profile given that the fall - off in its outer regions lies between that of a tidally truncated king model and the observed profiles of the young lmc clusters .",
    "the initial distribution of stellar masses is drawn from the imf of  @xcite which is a three - part power law fit to stellar data in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we take the lower and upper mass limits to be @xmath35m@xmath10 and @xmath36m@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we assume solar metallicity for the stars in our clusters .",
    "this is an appropriate choice for the younger clusters  for example ,  @xcite have shown that ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 , whose ages are about @xmath37 and @xmath38myr respectively , are well matched by isochrones of approximately solar metallicity . since the pairs of clusters in the go7307 hst sample",
    "were chosen to have similar metallicity , we know a priori that the observed range of cluster core radii can not be due to metallicity variations .",
    "we have therefore chosen to perform all our simulations at solar metallicity , and postpone discussion of the effects of metallicity variations on star cluster evolution to future work .",
    "table  [ tab : runs ] summarises the simulations which we have performed .",
    "the clusters in these runs initially contain @xmath39 or @xmath40 stars and have a mean mass of about @xmath41 m@xmath10 .",
    "clearly , the lmc clusters are more massive and contain greater numbers of stars than our model clusters and therefore direct comparison of the results of our simulations with the observed data must be approached with caution .",
    "however , the effects of increasing @xmath18 in our simulations can be estimated by considering the various time scales in the problems we study .",
    "detailed discussion of these scaling issues is presented in sections  [ sec : tides_discussion ] and  [ sec : bintidedisc ] where we argue that none of our conclusions is strongly dependent on the small size of our simulated clusters .",
    "we first consider the effects of the external tidal field of the lmc on the evolution of the cluster core radii .",
    "theoretical arguments and numerical simulations strongly suggest that tides have played a significant role in the evolution of star clusters and cluster systems in galaxies such as the milky way  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , observations of tidal tails around at least twenty milky way globular clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide compelling evidence of the ongoing disruption of star clusters by the milky way .",
    "the gravitational field of the lmc ( mass @xmath42m@xmath10 ) is much weaker than that of a galaxy like the milky way ( mass @xmath43m@xmath10 ) .",
    "however , as  @xcite show ( their fig .  15 ) , there is a deficit of low - mass clusters older than @xmath3 years .",
    "if we assume that the cluster population originally contained a spectrum of cluster masses similar to that of the present - day young clusters , their absence at late times strongly suggests that tides have been at work on the cluster system in exactly the manner expected from the models of  @xcite .",
    "given that the go7307 hst sample of 8 clusters was selected on the basis that they lie at similar distances from the lmc centre but display a wide range of core radii , the steady tidal field experienced by a cluster on a roughly circular orbit can not be the origin of the observed trends .",
    "further , given the intrinsic weakness of the lmc field at a radius of @xmath44kpc , where our clusters lie , one might not expect the tidal field to play a significant role in cluster evolution .",
    "we therefore consider clusters on non - circular orbits .",
    "such clusters experience tidal shocks during their orbits and we investigate whether these impart sufficient energy to the cluster to produce differences in the evolution of @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite discusses the possible role of disk shocking in the internal evolution of the intermediate - age lmc clusters , but questions whether any of the clusters is on an appropriate disk - crossing orbit for this to be an important effect . in this section",
    "we consider instead the tidal shocking produced by a point mass galaxy .    in order to investigate the role of the lmc tidal field in the evolution of its cluster system",
    ", it is necessary to incorporate an appropriate external gravitational field into the simulations .",
    "we model the lmc potential as that of a point mass of @xmath45m@xmath10 .",
    "this is a rather drastic oversimplification of the actual situation .",
    "we note , however , that this model exaggerates the effect of the tidal field , as any extended distribution of mass will have a more slowly varying gravitational potential .",
    "further , in the radius range @xmath46  kpc , in which our model clusters orbit , the gradient of the potential is within a factor of two of that of the detailed lmc mass model of  @xcite .",
    "thus our simulations constitute a plausible upper limit to the possible effects of tides .    in the simulations ,",
    "the equations of motion are integrated in an accelerating but non - rotating reference frame centred on the centre of mass of the cluster and whose axes are aligned with fixed spatial directions .",
    "this choice of frame simplifies the equations of motion for a cluster on a non - circular orbit despite having less symmetry than the more usual rotating frame used for steady tidal fields whose axes always point towards the attracting centre  @xcite .",
    "implementation of the time varying tidal field requires some care because mass loss from evolving stars or the escape of stars from the cluster causes the centre of mass to acquire a non - zero velocity relative to the frame of integration .",
    "it is therefore necessary to re - centre the frame of reference to coincide with the rest frame of the centre of mass following each such event .",
    "all internal and external forces must then be reinitialized to ensure consistency with the re - centred frame during subsequent integrations .",
    "we have performed simulations for clusters on elliptical orbits with perigalactic radii @xmath47kpc and apogalactic radii @xmath48kpc , probing the region in which most of our sample clusters lie but largely avoiding the complications of the inner regions of the lmc which may contain a stellar bar  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also modelled clusters on circular orbits at a radius of @xmath49kpc which corresponds to the time - averaged radius of the elliptical orbits .",
    "this allows us to isolate the effect of the time variation of the tidal field because both sets of clusters experience the same mean tidal field .",
    "we calculate the initial perigalactic tidal radius @xmath50 in the approximation that the cluster is on a circular orbit at a radius @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", @xmath50 is determined from the cluster mass @xmath52 , the mass of the point mass galaxy @xmath53 and @xmath51 via  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath54 the apocentric tidal radius @xmath55 is determined in a similar way from @xmath56 .",
    "the unit of length , which determines the conversion between length units and physical units , is then chosen such that the limiting radius of all clusters is initially equal to @xmath50 . however , at the start of the simulations the clusters are placed at the apocentre of their orbits about the lmc which means that they do not fill their tidal radii . if , instead , the clusters initially extended to @xmath55 and were not truncated at @xmath50 then the removal of stars outside @xmath50 during the first few perigalactic passages could mask any heating effects at radii interior to @xmath50 due to the time variation of the tidal field .",
    "in contrast to a king model , the plummer density law ( [ eqn : plummer ] ) formally extends to infinity and so the outer radius of a cluster is not well - defined .",
    "the length unit we use yields a pericentric tidal radius close to the ( random ) position of the outermost star in our initial clusters .",
    "the internal stellar velocities are scaled to ensure virial equilibrium at the start of the simulation .",
    "the tidal radius of a cluster on an elliptical orbit does not have a unique value .",
    "it varies continuously both as the cluster moves along its orbit and when the cluster loses mass through stellar evolution or the escape of member stars .",
    "however , for clusters whose internal relaxation times are longer than their orbital periods , tidal stripping tends to truncate the star cluster at @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "these two time scales are of similar magnitude for our simulated clusters so we expect two - body relaxation processes to lead to some expansion of the cluster beyond @xmath50 .",
    "we take account of this by defining escaping stars to be those stars outside twice the apogalactic tidal radius @xmath55 .",
    "stars whose orbits carry them outside this radius are generally lost to the cluster  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "stars are thus free to populate the region between @xmath50 and @xmath58 .",
    "the choice of length unit determines the physical density of the cluster and hence the physical rate at which two - body relaxation processes affect the evolution of the cluster .",
    "our aim is to investigate the influence of a time - varying external tidal field so it is important to ensure that all internal evolutionary processes proceed in an identical manner for each of our simulated clusters .",
    "we therefore use the same length unit for the clusters on circular orbits as we chose for those on elliptical orbits .",
    "this means that the clusters on circular orbits also do not initially fill their tidal radii and so necessarily allows expansion of these clusters .",
    "however , since the circular orbits are placed at the time - averaged radius of the elliptical orbits this expansion should on average be the same for both sets of clusters .",
    "any differences in the rates of expansion are due to the time variation in the tidal field .    the effect of steady tidal fields on star cluster evolution has been the subject of papers by a number of authors  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , until recently the problem of clusters moving in time - varying tidal fields had received relatively little attention from simulations .",
    "@xcite uses the results of some simulations of single - mass star clusters orbiting a point mass to determine the appropriate choice of escape radius for simulations of mass loss .",
    "more recently ,  @xcite presented an extensive survey of the dynamical evolution of star clusters in external tidal fields .",
    "our investigation is complementary to theirs because we are looking at the evolution of the observable global structure of the cluster while  @xcite focus their attention mostly on the evolution of the stellar mass function within the cluster .",
    "the results of all our simulations are presented in terms of quantities which can be compared directly with those calculated from the observed data , thereby enabling us to discuss how different dynamical processes impact on observations .",
    "we follow the evolution of the clusters for about @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the half - mass relaxation time ) this corresponds to @xmath61gyr in most cases . by this time , the clusters on elliptical orbits have lost more than @xmath36 per cent of their stars making estimates of properties such as the core radius increasingly noisy . at regular intervals during the evolution ,",

    "it is apparent from this figure that the core radius evolution in both cases is indistinguishable , especially in view of the noise associated with the output of small-@xmath18 simulations . during the first @xmath63yrs",
    ", the core radius is seen to decrease slightly from its initial value .",
    "this is because the calculation of @xmath16 is dominated by the light of the most massive stars which rapidly become more centrally concentrated due to the effects of mass segregation . as fig .",

    "after its initial contraction phase , the core radius begins to increase .",
    "this occurs because the clusters do not fill the tidal radius corresponding to their galactocentric positions at the start of the simulations .",

    "after about @xmath74myr , the cluster is temporarily displaced from equilibrium ( @xmath75 ) by mass loss from the most massive stars .",

    "[ fig : velevol ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath16 of the cluster does not change as a result of this mass loss .",
    "stellar evolution can not account for the sustained expansion of the cluster , however .",
    "the cluster loses about @xmath76 per cent of its mass as a result of the above mass loss events . using the virial theorem it is straightforward to show that the gravitational radius @xmath77 of a stellar system with initial radius @xmath78 and mass @xmath52 which loses an amount of mass @xmath79 is given by  @xcite @xmath80 a @xmath76 per cent mass loss should lead to an increase of less than @xmath37 per cent in the size of the cluster which is insufficient to account for the cluster expansion seen in figs .",

    "initially , the velocity distribution throughout the cluster is isotropic ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "while the central parts of the cluster retain this isotropy , in the outer parts the distribution becomes increasingly radially anisotropic ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this indicates that the continued growth of @xmath66 is being fueled by encounters in the inner parts of the cluster which produce a population of stars on extended radial orbits .",
    "the velocity distribution in the outer parts of isolated clusters simulated by  @xcite exhibited similar behaviour during post core - collapse evolution ; those authors similarly concluded that the growth of the outer lagrangian radii at late times was due to two - body processes in the inner regions .",
    "given the similarity between the core radius evolution of clusters on circular and elliptical orbits , we now proceed to investigate the extent to which the clusters on elliptical orbits have been affected by the variation in the tidal field . fig .",
    "[ fig : internal_props ] presents the evolution of certain key internal properties of two typical clusters , one on a circular orbit and one on an elliptical orbit .",

    "the third and fourth panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : internal_props ] show how @xmath60 and @xmath66 evolve during the cluster orbit .",
    "the most noticeable effect is that the relaxation time for the cluster on the elliptical orbit is significantly reduced after the second perigalactic passage , so that the cluster evolves more rapidly following this encounter .",
    "this is due both to the decrease in the total number of stars in the cluster and to the increase in the mean stellar mass @xmath86 ( shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : internal_props ] ) .",
    "the increase in @xmath86 occurs because , on average , low - mass stars acquire larger velocities during pericentre passages and are hence more likely to escape from the cluster .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is seen to increase during the perigalactic passage but rapidly settles back to a value slightly below the circular - orbit value .",

    "thus shocks should have less impact on the @xmath16 of larger-@xmath18 clusters and the observed expansions of clusters on both circular and elliptical orbits should remain similar .    the second possible improvement would be to use a more realistic model of the lmc potential , for example one based upon the recent mass models of  @xcite . however , the actual lmc mass distribution is more extended than the keplerian potential we have been using in our simulations and therefore the gradients in its gravitational field are smaller .",

    "thus , while larger-@xmath18 clusters would obviously survive for longer than those in our present simulations , their physical rate of @xmath16 expansion would be reduced .",

    "we are currently investigating the long - term evolution of clusters which experience different degrees of primordial gas loss owing to sfes in the range @xmath149 , required to explain the range of core radii seen in the youngest lmc clusters  @xcite . we are also simulating the effects of primordial binaries on larger-@xmath18 clusters .",
    "of particular interest is the possibility that the heating effects of a large binary population could enable a cluster to retain a large initial @xmath16 produced by gas expulsion .",
