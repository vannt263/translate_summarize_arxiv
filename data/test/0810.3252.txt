    "the optical monitoring camera , omc @xcite , observes the optical emission from the prime targets of the gamma - ray instruments on board the esa mission integral : spi ( gamma - ray spectrometer ) and ibis ( gamma - ray imager ) , with the support of the jem - x monitor in the x - ray domain .",
    "omc has the same field of view ( fov ) as the fully coded fov of jem - x , and it is co - aligned with the central part of the larger fields of view of ibis and spi .",
    "this capability provides invaluable diagnostic information on the nature and the physics of the sources over a broad wavelength range .",
    "the omc is based on a refractive optics with a johnson v filter passband ( centred at @xmath0  nm ) .",
    "it has an aperture of 50 mm focused onto a large format ccd ( @xmath1  pixels ) working in frame transfer mode ( @xmath2  pixels imaging area ) .",
    "its field of view is @xmath3 and image scale is @xmath4  arcsec / pixel .",
    "the point spread function is a gaussian with fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) @xmath5  pixels ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "point source location accuracy is around @xmath7 ( 1 sigma ) .",
    "it works properly in a @xmath8 flux factor range , from @xmath9  mag ( saturation effects appears ) to @xmath10  mag ( magnitude limit for 3 sigma source detection , combining all shots per pointing ) .",
    "this magnitude limit depends on sky background and source contamination , which can be very important .",
    "the omc single shots are variable , currently there is a 10 , 50 and 200 seconds exposures cycle .    due to telemetry restrictions ,",
    "only a fraction of the ccd image is transmitted to earth , usually 1% of its surface .",
    "then , many subwindows ( typically 100 , and in any case less than 228 ) of @xmath11  pixels are extracted and sent to ground .",
    "the targets to be monitored have to be preselected on ground .",
    "for this purpose , an omc input catalogue @xcite has been compiled .",
    "it contains most gamma and x - ray sources , variable stars , and hipparcos and tycho reference stars for astrometric and photometric calibration .",
    "the catalogue contains currently more than @xmath12 targets .",
    "fluxes are calculated in 3 different nearly circular apertures : 1 , 3 , and 5 diameter pixels .",
    "absolute photometric calibration is achieved by comparison with a number of reference standard stars within the field of view of the instrument .",
    "all the data processed by omc is open to the scientific community .",
    "the omc team has developed a scientific archive , containing the data generated by the omc and an access system capable of performing complex searches , complementary to the integral archive hosted at isdc .",
    "the system is reachable at :    http://sdc.laeff.inta.es/omc",
    "the second ibis / isgri soft gamma - ray survey catalog @xcite was obtained with the ibis / isgri gamma - ray imager on board the integral satellite .",
    "it is based on more than 10 ms of observations during the first 2 years of core program and public observations , and it covers around 50% of the whole sky .",
    "this catalog comprises 209 high energy sources .",
    "13 of them are new igrs recently discovered and they are not in the omc input catalog yet . on the other hand , there are 196 objects observed by omc .",
    "the mean position error for all the sources detected by ibis / isgri with significance above 10 sigma is @xmath13 , enough to identify most of them with a known x - ray counterpart , but not enough in optical wavelengths because sometimes there are more than one optical sources inside the error circle .    in table",
    "[ tab : statistical ] we show some statistical results . in 51 cases ( 26 % ) the counterpart is detected by omc ( catalog magnitude @xmath14  mag ) .",
    "for all these cases we obtain useful light curves , except some of them which are contaminated with flux from a close bright source .",

    "these mosaics are groups of @xmath19 pixel subwindows , made up of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 subwindows .    in these cases",
    "there are many optical sources inside the high energy source error circle ( sometimes up to hundreds ) . using omc we obtain photometric measures and light curves for all of them .",
    "omc plots could help to disentangle which the real counterpart is .",
    "these mosaics have been processed using sextractor @xcite and a hand made pipeline @xcite .",

    "cyg x-1 is an x - ray binary system ( see figure [ fig : withknowncounterpart_cyg_x-1 ] ) .",

    "this star is a type o9.7iab blue giant filling its roche lobe and transferring mass into the black hole .",
    "we can see a variation in optical cyg x-1 light curve .",
    "after detrending a lineal tendency , we have calculated the best period using a phase dispersion minimization method .",
    "its calculated period is 5.6 days , the well known orbital period of the system .",
    "it is due to the blue giant star filling its roche lobe , because the cross section viewed from the earth depends on the orbital period around the compact object .",
    "omc provides the precise orbital phase for the study of this object .",
    "this object has a nearby star whose light contaminates its photometry .",
    "however , omc achieves enough precision to catch the 0.06 magnitude amplitude variation .",

    "nevertheless , the x - ray plot shows that 3c 279 is not detected .    as other blazars , 3c 279 light curve",
    "is expected to show microvariability ( around 0.05 magnitudes in a short time scale ) , flares ( around 1 magnitude in one week ) and outbursts ( many magnitudes in months or years ) .",
    "omc allows us to analyze these long term variations easily .",
    "the galactic bulge is a region rich in bright variable high - energy x - ray and gamma - ray sources .",
    "integral observes this region regularly during all the visibility periods , in a specific program called galactic bulge monitoring @xcite .",
    "the main aim is to investigate the source variability and transient activity on time scales of days to weeks to months at hard x - ray and soft gamma - ray .",
    "one complete hexagonal dither pattern ( 7 pointings of 1800 seconds each ) is performed during each integral revolution , roughly ever 3 days .    as a service to the scientific community",
    ", the jem - x and ibis / isgri light curves in two energy bands ( jem - x : @xmath27  kev and @xmath28  kev , isgri : @xmath29  kev and @xmath30  kev ) are made publicly available as soon as the observations are performed in :    http://isdc.unige.ch/science/bulge omc monitors all sources detected by ibis / isgri in the galactic bulge which are in its field of view .",
    "the full analysis is working in an automatic way , producing the results ( light curves ) in a short period of time , usually less than 24 hours after the observation is performed . at the moment , there are 26 sources with wide light curves and useful data .",
    "because the galactic bulge region is very crowded for omc , in the flux extraction process we force the photometric aperture to be centred at the source coordinates , which are taken from the omc input catalogue .",
    "this is a new functionality in omc osa 6.0 ( osa , off - line standard analysis , distributed by isdc ) .",
    "it allows us to monitor not only those sources already detected by omc , but also those previously undetected that could show bright flares detectable occasionally by omc .",
    "for all sources we obtain one photometric point per omc shot .",
    "in addition , for weak sources we combine the shots in one photometric point per each pointing in the hexagonal dithering .",
    "figure [ fig : igr_j17544 - 2619 ] is an example of simultaneous light curves in two different energy ranges .",
    "the source is igr j17544 - 2619 ( iomc 6849000050 ) , probably a hmxrb @xcite .",
    "with omc we observe its probable counterpart ( 2mass j17542527 - 2619526 , @xcite ) , although there are other fainter candidates in the 2mass archive not detectable by omc .",
