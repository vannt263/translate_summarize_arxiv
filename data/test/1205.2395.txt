    "stripped supernovae ( sne ) and long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( long grbs ) are nature s most powerful explosions from massive stars .",
    "they energize and enrich the interstellar medium , and , like beacons , they are visible over large cosmological distances",
    ". however , the mass and metallicity range of their progenitors is not known , nor the detailed physics of the explosion ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "stripped - envelope sne ( i.e , sne of types iib , ib , and ic , e.g. , @xcite ) are core - collapse events whose massive progenitors have been stripped of progressively larger amounts of their outermost h and he envelopes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , broad - lined sne  ic ( sne  ic - bl ) are sne ic whose line widths approach 20,000@xmath030,000 @xmath1  around maximum light ( see below ) and whose optical spectra show no trace of h and he .    for the last 15 years , the exciting connection between long grbs and sne  ic - bl , the only type of sne observed accompanying long grbs ( for reviews , see @xcite ) , and the existence of many more sne  ic - bl _ without _ grbs raises the question of what distinguishes sn - grb progenitors from those of ordinary sne  ic - bl without grbs .",
    "viewing angle effects are probably not the reason why those sne ic - bl did not show an accompanied grbs @xcite and based the same radio upper - limits , only @xmath2 1% of sne ib / c appear to be accompanied by grbs @xcite .",
    "one promising line of attack is to investigate what sets apart sne ib / c * with * grbs from those * without * grbs to elucidate the conditions and progenitors of these two types of explosions .",
    "while of course there are numerous possible avenues ( for a recent review see e.g. , @xcite ) , i will here adopt a two - thronged approach , given the short amount of time : first , i focus on comparing the optical spectra of sne ib / c with and without grbs , since early - time optical spectra are used for identifying the spectral features of different explosions and probe the bulk of the ejected stellar material , in particular the outermost layers .",
    "secondly , i present a meta - analysis of published measured metallicities at the explosion site of sne ib / c with and without grbs .",
    "metallicity is expected to strongly impact the lives and deaths of stars due to the metallicity dependence of mass loss ( e.g. , @xcite ) and its subsequent link to rotation and angular momentum content of the stellar core .",
    "the main thrust of my talk is that now a number of different groups , including ours , have contributed to gathering large data - sets , whose analysis can to lead to robust statistical conclusions and interesting insights into different populations of sne with and without grbs .",
    "while the observational hallmark of a sn ic - bl is , by the definition , its high expansion velocity ( which , when modeled in combination with light curves , yields high energies , sometimes above @xmath3 erg , i.e. 10 times more than the canonical ccsn , and thus motivated some to call them `` hypernovae '' ) , there are debates within the community whether such sne ic - bl can be robustly distinguished from `` normal '' sne ic and whether there are systematic differences between sne ic - bl with and without grbs .",
    "prior work involving synthetic models based on monte carlo radiative transfer codes ( @xcite and reference therein ) , while important , has included only a few normal sne ic and a few sn ic - bl without grbs , thus not yet providing a large sample .    here",
    "we are using the spectra from the cfa sample of stripped sne ( modjaz et al . in prep ) , as well as those from the literature ( see references in modjaz et al . in prep ) to compare the absorption velocities as traced by fe ii @xmath45169 of different kinds of sne ic .",
    "spectral synthesis studies have shown that this and other fe lines are good tracers of the photospheric velocity , since they do not saturate @xcite . with the largest sample of spectra to date",
    ", we find that sn ic - bl * with * grbs have the * highest * absorption velocities ( 25,000@xmath035,000 @xmath1  at maximum v - light ) , while sne ic - bl * without * grbs have * lower * velocities ( between 15,000@xmath025,000 @xmath1  at maximum v - light ) , and normal sn ic have the lowest absorption velocities ( 8,000@xmath015,000 @xmath1 ) .",
    "of course , we caution that because of sever blending , specifically in sne ic - bl , the fe ii @xmath45169 line could be blended with other nearby lines in a manner such that it may compromise the velocity measurements .",
    "however other , more isolated , lines ( e.g. si ii ) also indicate high velocities for sn ic - bl .",
    "= 8.9 ( levesque et al . 2010a ) .",
    ", width=345 ]    since direct sn ib / c progenitor detection attempts via deep pre - explosion images have not been successful @xcite and are impossible for grbs , we employ a complimentary approach : we study the host galaxy environments in order to discern any systematic trends as a function explosion type that may characterize their stellar progenitors .",
    "specifically , massive stars at different metallicities are expected to live and die differently , due to the metallicity dependence of mass loss and its subsequent link to rotation and angular momentum content of the stellar core ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since the early work on grb host metallicities and their comparison with sdss galaxies as well as with sn galaxies ,",
    "the field of environmental metallicity studies has experienced a tremendous growth ( see discussions in e.g. , levesque et al .",
    "2010a , @xcite and references therein , as well as contributions in this volume ) .    here",
    ", we outline the recipe for state - of - the - art metallicity analysis , specifically of the oxygen abundance from nebular hii region emission lines , first formalized in @xcite : 1 ) in order to probe the natal oxygen abundance , obtain spectra at the position of the sn or grb ( because of metallicity gradients in spiral galaxies ) ; 2 ) include only sne with secure sn i d ( i.e. , ideally from multi - epoch sn spectra to monitor for any potential classification changes ) and also ( only ) from untargetted surveys in order to mitigate any selection effects ; 3 ) employ spectrographs with a large wavelength range in order to observe emission lines ( from [ oii ] @xmath43727 to h@xmath5 and [ nii ] @xmath46584 ) as to compute abundances in different diagnostics , since there are systematic differences between different diagnostics @xcite ; 4 ) remove stellar absorption in spectra when necessary , and 5 ) obtain good handle on uncertainty budget and propagate line flux and reddening uncertainties into abundance measurement errors via monte carlo simulations .",
    "while recently different groups have arrived at different conclusions about whether there is a statistically significant trend of metallicity with stripped sn subtype ( @xcite , see also proceedings by anderson , leloudas in this volume ) , not all measured metallicities reported in the anderson and leloudas et al samples are at the position of the sne .",
    "thus , we conducted a meta - analysis of all samples @xcite with the best - possible quality - control and following the above state - of - the - art recipe , now that we have larger samples to draw from : we only included oxygen abundance measurements at the exact sn explosion sites ( within the slit ) of sne with solid ids and also from untargeted surveys , to have the best handle possible on the natal metallicity estimates of sne with well - determined sn types over a large metallicity baseline , the ultimate goal of the study .",
    "figure  [ oxyfig ] shows the result of our metal - analysis , namely the cumulative distributions of local metallicities for different types of stripped ccsne ( sne ib , ic , ic - bl without grbs , sne ic - bl with grbs ) from the combined samples .",
    "we find that with a combined and large sample size , the sites of sne ic do indeed have higher oxygen abundances than sne ib , and with a higher statistical significance than in the individual samples",
    ". there is only a 0.1% ( 2% ) probability in the pp04-n2 ( pp04-o3n2 ) scale that the oxygen abundances of the 19 ( 17 ) sne ib and of 20 ( 18 ) sne ic are drawn from the same parent population , which are different on average by @xmath20.2 dex .",
    "here we have taken advantage of the power of statistics by combining the hard work of three different groups .",
    "in addition , sn ic - bl with grbs still prefer , on average , more metal - poor environments than those without grbs ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) , with the grb metallicity - luminosity relation offset to lower metallicities , but without a cut - off metallicity above which grb production would be suppressed ( levesque et al .",
    "2010b ) . since the host galaxies of both samples span similar range in galaxy luminosity ( i.e , .",
    "even to luminous grb host galaxies of @xmath6 mag ) , dust effects are most likely not the reason for the offset to low metallicity . however , while these results are intriguing , the next step is to conduct a thorough and extensive host galaxy study with a large single - survey , untargeted , spectroscopically classified , and homogeneous collection of stripped sne , something we are currently undertaking with the palomar transient factory ( ptf )",
