    "when water is cooled below @xmath0c at atmospheric pressure it freezes , it turns into ice .",
    "this conversion of one phase , water , into another , ice , starts with the nucleation of a microscopic nucleus of ice .",
    "this nucleus consists of only of order 10 molecules , its formation costs free energy and occurs not in the bulk of the water but at a surface in contact with the water .",
    "the free energy cost provides a barrier to the nucleation of ice .",
    "if the free energy cost or barrier is large it will limit the rate of crystallisation .",
    "when the barrier is very large the phase which is not the equilibrium one , for example water below @xmath0c , will persist for very long times . the fluid phase is then called metastable . so to determine whether a phase which is not an equilibrium phase is metastable or whether the equilibrium phase nucleates rapidly we need to calculate the free energy barrier to nucleation",
    "we do this here near to and at _ another _ phase transition , a phase transition between two phases neither of which is the true equilibrium phase .",
    "the process of nucleation at a surface is called heterogeneous nucleation to distinguish it from homogeneous nucleation which occurs in the bulk .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an introduction to nucleation .",
    "so , here we study the rate of heterogeneous nucleation of one phase transition , a fluid - crystal phase transition , near a second phase transition  a phase transition between phases which are both meta- or unstable with respect to crystallisation .",
    "this second phase transition is a vapour - liquid transition . at phase transitions",
    "the thermodynamic functions , including interfacial tensions , exhibit singular behaviour which is universal in the sense that many different systems show behaviour which is identical up to a few scale factors . here",
    "we show that at the vapour - liquid transition the free energy barrier to heterogeneous nucleation of a crystal shows behaviour which although not truly universal is the same near all vapour - liquid transitions , up to a few scale factors , assuming that the longest - range interactions are dispersion forces .",
    "this is due to wetting : the formation of a thick layer of the liquid phase on a surface in contact with the vapour phase @xcite .",
    "the layer forms as coexistence is approached and causes a drop in the nucleation barrier to the nucleation of a dense phase such as a crystalline phase .",
    "the dependence on the nature of longest - range forces makes our findings not - quite universal ( unlike homogeneous nucleation near a bulk critical point @xcite which is universal ) .",
    "motivation for our study is provided by the fact that some globular proteins have the correct set of phase transitions to observe heterogeneous nucleation of a crystal near a vapour - liquid transition .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for the phase diagrams of a number of globular proteins .",
    "the crystallisation of globular proteins is of great interest because protein crystals are required in order to determine the all - important three - dimensional structure of a protein @xcite .",
    "also , although we will always refer to the nucleus as being crystalline and the other transition as being a vapour - liquid transition , our findings are much more general .",
    "they refer to the nucleation of any noncritical phase near another , ising - type , phase transition .",
    "we simply describe the phases as crystal , vapour and liquid for simplicity and because having definite phases in mind is useful for pedagogical purposes .    earlier work has found universal behaviour of the nucleation barrier for _ homogeneous",
    "_ nucleation near a bulk critical point , see refs .",
    "@xcite . this earlier work , in particular that of ten wolde and frenkel @xcite , inspired this study of heterogeneous nucleation and the results of refs .",
    "@xcite are in a sense the homogeneous nucleation analogues of the results we will obtain for heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "also , talanquer and oxtoby have studied heterogeneous nucleation of a liquid from a vapour phase @xcite .",
    "they studied the nucleation of the liquid phase at a surface when the liquid phase itself is close to wetting this surface .",
    "so , although they studied heterogeneous nucleation in the vicinity of a wetting transition , as we do below , they studied the nucleation of the liquid phase , the phase which is doing the wetting , whereas here we study the heterogeneous nucleation of another phase , the crystalline phase .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce both our model of the process of heterogeneous nucleation and the phase behaviour of the systems we are interested in .",
    "in section [ wetnuc ] we derive the variation in the rate of heterogeneous nucleation near wetting transitions .",
    "then in section [ homo ] we compare with homogeneous nucleation of a crystal near a bulk critical point .",
    "the last section is a conclusion .",
    "heterogeneous nucleation is an activated process @xcite and as such occurs at a rate which decreases exponentially with the height of the barrier @xmath1 , which must be overcome .",
    "if @xmath2 is the number of nuclei per unit area crossing the barrier per unit time then @xmath2 is given by an expression of the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a surface density , i.e. , it has dimensions of inverse area , and @xmath5 is a characteristic time",
    ". we will refer to @xmath2 as the nucleation rate or heterogeneous nucleation rate .",
    "the surface is smooth , perfectly planar and chemically homogeneous .",
    "equation ( [ rate ] ) comes from the fact that the nucleus is a large , i.e. , improbable , fluctuation . as a fluctuation",
    "its probability of occurring in unit area is @xmath6 .",
    "the rate at which these fluctuations cross the barrier is then estimated as the number of fluctuations divided by @xmath5 which is an estimate of how long it takes the nucleus to acquire one or a few extra molecules , enough for the nucleus to be big enough to grow irreversibly into a crystallite .",
    "equation ( [ rate ] ) is far from rigorous but has been found for homogeneous nucleation to be a reasonable estimate .",
    "see the book of debenedetti @xcite for a discussion and @xcite for a detailed comparison of an expression of the form of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) with the results of computer simulation ( for homogeneous nucleation ) . for the remainder of this work",
    "we will assume that @xmath5 and @xmath4 vary weakly with temperature and chemical potential and so the variation of the rate of heterogeneous nucleation is dominated by the variation in the free energy barrier @xmath1 .",
    "work on homogeneous nucleation has shown this assumption to be most often justified , except near a glass transition where @xmath5 increases sharply . however , verifying it requires a detailed calculation for a specific model system , which we do not do here .",
    "consider the phase diagram in the chemical - potential  temperature plane shown in fig .",
    "it is the phase diagram of a simple model of a globular protein , calculated using an approximate theory .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for the precise definition of the model ; the model parameters have the same values as they do for fig .  4 of that reference .",
    "also , see this reference for the same phase diagram in the density - temperature plane which can be seen to be qualitatively like that of a number of globular proteins @xcite . at true equilibrium",
    "there is only one phase transition , from a fluid phase , the equilibrium phase below the solid curve , to a crystal , the equilibrium phase above the curve .",
    "however , if the barrier to formation of the crystal phase is high then the chemical potential can be increased at constant temperature along a path such as that indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ mut ] , until the metastable fluid undergoes another phase transition : a transition from a vapour phase to a liquid phase .",
    "the vapour is below the dashed curve , the liquid above .",
    "we have used the phase diagram of a model protein because it has the correct form : it has a vapour - liquid transition near where we expect the nucleation of the crystalline phase to occur .",
    "however , the behaviour we find will apply whenever heterogeneous nucleation occurs at a surface which passes through a wetting transition .",
    "figure [ fighet ] is a schematic of a crystalline nucleus in contact with a surface and immersed in a liquid layer of thickness @xmath7 , with a vapour phase on top .",
    "this is the situation of interest , there is a bulk vapour phase against a smooth surface which attracts the molecules causing a layer of liquid to form near and at vapour - liquid coexistence . at coexistence and",
    "if we are above the wetting temperature , see refs .",
    "@xcite and section [ wetnuc ] , there is a very thick layer of liquid covering the surface and separating the vapour phase from the surface .",
    "the thickness @xmath7 is then limited only by gravity .",
    "this wetting layer will reduce the nucleation barrier greatly if the interfacial tension between the liquid and the nucleus , @xmath8 is lower than that between the vapour and the nucleus , @xmath9 .",
    "if the surface area of the nucleus not in contact with the surface is @xmath10 , then the free energy reduction will be @xmath11 when the wetting layer forms . for @xmath10 of order 10 times the area per molecule of the surface of a crystal , and the difference @xmath12 of order @xmath13 divided by the area of one molecule ,",
    "the reduction in the surface contribution to the free energy barrier is of order @xmath14 .",
    "this reduction will occur on moving in the vapour phase from conditions of chemical potential and temperature far from vapour - liquid coexistence , where there is no wetting layer , to at or very near coexistence . a large reduction which will lead , eq .  ( [ rate ] ) , to a very large increase in the nucleation rate @xmath15 , which should be easily large enough to observe in an experiment .",
    "in this section we start with the assumption that the variation of the rate is dominated by that in the free - energy barrier @xmath1 and then calculate how @xmath1 varies near wetting transitions of different types . near a wetting transition the qualitative behaviour , in particular the form of the singularities , can be determined without knowing any specific details of the interactions or of the phase which is nucleating , we only require that the longest range interactions be dispersion forces @xcite . this is true as the singularities come from long lengthscale phenomena for which the small lengthscale chemical details are irrelevant .",
    "there are a number of different wetting phase transitions , see for example the excellent review of schick @xcite .",
    "we will deal with the three most common , starting with complete wetting . in each case",
    "we will work very close to the wetting transition , temperatures or chemical potentials very close to their values at the transition .",
    "we will determine the leading order singular terms in the temperature or chemical potential variation of the nucleation rate near the transition .",
    "as heterogeneous nucleation occurs at a surface in contact with the fluid it is rather obviously controlled by what happens at the surface .",
    "now , if the surface attracts the molecules of the fluid then not - too - far from the critical point @xcite , we will have wetting .",
    "wetting is where at vapour - liquid coexistence a thick layer of the liquid phase interposes itself between the surface and the vapour phase , replacing the surface - vapour interface by a surface - liquid interface plus a liquid - vapour interface .",
    "it is also called complete wetting @xcite . at coexistence",
    "the thickness of the layer is generally limited only by gravity .",
    "thus , our first result is the , rather obvious , fact that if the surface is wet by a thick layer of liquid the rate of heterogeneous nucleation will be the _ same _ at surfaces in contact with the two coexisting phases , the vapour and the liquid .",
    "this result is universal , it is true whenever the surface is wet .",
    "the free energy cost of forming a nucleus at the surface in contact with the bulk vapour is the same as the cost of forming a nucleus at the surface in contact with the bulk liquid , as both surfaces are covered by liquid .",
    "this is at coexistence , the chemical potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the chemical potential at vapour - liquid coexistence at this temperature . in the vapour phase off coexistence , @xmath18 , there is still a layer of liquid at the surface provided @xmath19 is not too negative .",
    "but this layer thins as @xmath20 becomes more negative as we move farther from coexistence .",
    "how it thins depends on the nature of the longest - range forces present in the system @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the longest range forces are dispersion forces , which is most often the case .",
    "then the free energy per unit area , @xmath21 , of a film of liquid between the surface and the vapour of thickness @xmath7 is @xcite @xmath22 where we have included only those parts which depend on the thickness of the layer .",
    "the first term is the contribution of the dispersion forces , @xmath23 is a positive constant and the @xmath24 dependence comes from starting with the usual @xmath25 dependence , integrating over a volume , for the solid substrate , and then over the thickness of the layer of liquid .",
    "this fourfold integration changes the @xmath25 dependence to @xmath24 @xcite . the second term is the increase in free energy due to the formation of a layer of liquid of thickness @xmath7 when the chemical potential of the liquid , @xmath17 , is higher than the chemical potential . in this term @xmath26 is the difference in number density between the liquid and vapour phases .",
    "minimising the free energy eq .",
    "( [ fcomp ] ) we obtain the thickness @xmath27 which diverges at coexistence : this divergence is in practice cutoff at some large thickness by gravity .",
    "the divergence at coexistence is a genuine phase transition : @xmath28 is analogous to an order parameter and the exponent @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ lcomp ] ) is a critical exponent @xcite .",
    "so , what is the free energy barrier to heterogeneous nucleation off coexistence : @xmath30 but small ? we know that at coexistence the liquid layer is very thick and so the free energy of a nucleus in the vapour phase is the same as that in the liquid , call it @xmath31 . as we move off coexistence the liquid layer thins and the nucleus will notice this because it will interact with the vapour phase once @xmath7 is not too large .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fighet ] for a schematic of a nucleus at a substrate in a liquid layer . for @xmath7 larger than the radius of the nucleus",
    ", the nucleus will interact with the vapour as a point object .",
    "the interaction of a small object with the vapour across the liquid layer varies as @xmath32 and is proportional to the volume of the nucleus , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "so the nucleus - vapour interaction increases the nucleation barrier to @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a coefficient for the interaction of the nucleus with the vapour across a slab of liquid .",
    "a dense nucleus will generally repel a dilute vapour and so @xmath35 will then be positive @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on nucleation of a crystal phase and crystalline phases are rather dense . also , note that @xmath36 is a function of @xmath37 and",
    "we will use it for @xmath18 where the vapour phase is more stable than the liquid .",
    "we assume that we can continue @xmath31 into the region where the liquid is metastable with respect to the vapour , @xmath20 negative but small , and that @xmath31 is analytic at @xmath38 , at coexistence . using eq .",
    "( [ lcomp ] ) for the thickness we obtain @xmath39 which implies that @xmath40 as @xmath20 is negative in the vapour . for small @xmath20 the variation in @xmath1 is linear  the exponent is 1 .",
    "this result holds for any system at fluid - fluid coexistence with dispersion forces near a complete wetting transition .        for complete wetting",
    ", the thickness @xmath7 of the layer of liquid diverges as coexistence is approached , as in eq .",
    "( [ lcomp ] ) .",
    "now , on moving away from the critical point of the vapour - liquid transition , if the attraction of the surface for the molecules is not too strong , then the surface - vapour interface may cease to be wet by the liquid phase .",
    "then as coexistence is approached the thickness of the layer of liquid between the surface and the vapour does not diverge , it remains finite .",
    "this is called partial wetting @xcite .",
    "the transition from complete wetting to partial wetting is a phase transition .",
    "it can be continuous , called a critical wetting transition , or it can be first order . we will deal with each in turn .      below the wetting transition , @xmath53 , the surface is partially wet : either covered by a thin film of molecules or with only a few molecules on the surface .",
    "then as the coexistence curve is crossed at constant @xmath53 we go from a nucleus on a surface which is essentially in direct contact with the vapour ( with at most a thin film between them ) to a nucleus on a surface in contact with the liquid phase .",
    "the rate of heterogeneous nucleation then has a discontinuity at coexistence , @xmath16 .",
    "it will jump upwards , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figcw ] ( the dashed curve ) .",
    "in general we expect that the deeper we are into the region where the crystal is the equilibrium phase , the larger is the nucleation rate .",
    "thus we expect that if we cool coexisting vapour and liquid phases , that the rate of heterogeneous nucleation will increase in both , see fig .",
    "however , we have just shown that if there is a first - order wetting transition that the rate of heterogeneous nucleation will jump _ downwards _ as we cross this transition .",
    "potentially at least , the nucleation rate may not be a monotonic function of temperature : in the vapour phase it may increase and then jump downwards as the transition is crossed .",
    "a non monotonic variation in @xmath1 is very rare , we are aware of only one example @xcite . the non - monotonic variation in @xmath1 found by auer and frenkel @xcite is ( presumably ) not due the presence of another phase transition .    when the wetting transition at coexistence is first order , a prewetting transition branches off from the coexistence curve into the vapour off coexistence @xcite .",
    "this prewetting transition does not go far into the vapour phase , it ends at a critical point which is at a value of @xmath20 which depends on @xmath48 and @xmath56 but is always small . at the prewetting transition",
    "there is a jump in the value of @xmath7 , this jump decreases as @xmath20 decreases until the jump reaches zero at the prewetting critical point . at the prewetting transition as @xmath7 jumps",
    "then so does the barrier to nucleation , from eq .",
    "( [ fint ] ) .",
    "this transition including the critical point may be calculated from the free energy eq .",
    "( [ f1st ] ) . as",
    "this free energy is analytic it yields mean - field exponents for the critical point @xcite .",
    "thus at the temperature of the prewetting critical point , @xmath66 , and near the critical point the thickness difference @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the liquid layer thickness and value of @xmath20 at the critical point .",
    "this corresponds to the critical exponent @xmath70  its mean - field value .",
    "putting this variation of @xmath7 into our expression for the interaction of the nucleus with the vapour phase across the liquid layer , we obtain @xmath71 the nucleation barrier varies with the chemical potential minus that at the critical point to the one third power .",
    "@xmath72 is the free energy of the nucleus at the prewetting critical point , and eq .",
    "( [ prewetdf ] ) holds for @xmath73 and @xmath74 small .",
    "finally , we note that unlike complete and critical wetting , a first - order wetting transition proceeds via nucleation and growth , see refs .",
    "so for example on cooling below the transition , a metastable thick wetting layer may persist , where by metastable we mean the that the thickness of layer is not the thickness which occurs at the absolute minimum of the free energy eq .",
    "( [ f1st ] ) .",
    "note that this layer is then doubly metastable , its free energy is higher than that of a thinner film and the system with either of these two layer thicknesses has of course a higher free energy than at true equilibrium where there is dilute - fluid  crystal coexistence .",
    "above we have , for simplicity , neglected the time taken to reach equilibrium thickness and assumed that the thickness of the layer is always that at the minimum in the free energy eq .",
    "( [ f1st ] ) . in reality",
    "the transition from a thick to thin layer will follow some set of dynamics which will complicate the analysis .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein for the dynamics at first - order wetting transitions .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit study of the analogous problem of homogeneous nucleation near another transition where nucleation of the equilibrium and a metastable phase compete .",
    "essentially by definition , phase transitions are where the thermodynamic functions of an equilibrium system have singularities . in earlier work @xcite",
    "we showed that the rate of _ homogeneous _ nucleation has a singularity at a ising - type phase transition in the _ bulk _ and here we have shown that the rate of _ heterogeneous _ nucleation has a singularity at _ surface _ phase transitions associated with an ising - type phase transition in the bulk .",
    "the presence of a singularity at a phase transition is common to both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "our findings here for heterogeneous nucleation near a prewetting critical point and our earlier findings for homogeneous nucleation are particularly closely related . in both cases",
    "we have a nucleus which is a small ( point - like ) perturbation which couples to the order parameter of the transition @xcite .",
    "the order parameter is the density for the bulk transition and the thickness in the prewetting surface transition . in earlier work",
    "@xcite we used scaling arguments to obtain the correct exponents for homogeneous nucleation near the critical point of an ising - type transition .",
    "in heterogeneous nucleation the nucleus will couple to the order parameter of the prewetting transition , which is an ising - type transition in two dimensions . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that near an ising - type critical point the behaviour is fixed and universal providing only that the nucleus couples to the order parameter .",
    "thus heterogeneous nucleation near a prewetting critical point is completely analogous to homogeneous nucleation in a two - dimensional system near a bulk critical point .",
    "we can apply the scaling approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to heterogeneous nucleation near a prewetting critical point .",
    "we then obtain the correct and universal exponents for the variation of the free - energy barrier near the critical point .",
    "for example along the prewetting critical isotherm the free - energy barrier scales with distance to the critical point as @xmath75 where the exponent , which is @xmath76 , is obtained from the exact value @xmath77 for the ising model in two dimensions . in two dimensions",
    "the mean - field predictions for the critical exponents like @xmath78 are very poor : the mean - field prediction , eq .",
    "( [ prewetdf ] ) , has an exponent which is five times too large @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for definitions of the critical exponents . equation ( [ uni ] ) is just eq .",
    "( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite in two dimensions .",
    "see that reference for a derivation .",
    "almost invariably , a first - order phase transformation starts with heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "the nucleus of the new phase forms at a surface , see fig .",
    "[ fighet ] .",
    "thus , the free energy barrier to the formation of the nucleus and therefore the rate of nucleation in a phase depend sensitively on anything which happens at the interface between the surface and the phase . if the phase in contact with the surface is a vapour phase close to a second , vapour - liquid , phase transition , then if the surface attracts the molecules a wetting layer may form at the surface .",
    "this is a layer of liquid at the surface , separating the surface from the vapour .",
    "the wetting layer will reduce the nucleation barrier greatly if the interfacial tension between the liquid and the nucleus , @xmath8 is lower than that between the vapour and the nucleus , @xmath9 .",
    "we estimated in section [ hetero ] that the reduction in the surface contribution to the free energy barrier is of order @xmath14 . a large reduction which should be easily large enough to observe in an experiment .",
    "the formation of a wetting layer , either as coexistence is approached ( complete wetting ) , or along the coexistence curve ( critical wetting or a first - order wetting transition ) is a phase transition .",
    "we found that at complete wetting the derivative of the barrier as a function of chemical potential was discontinuous while the barrier itself has a discontinuity as the temperature is varied through a first - order wetting transition .",
    "thus the rate of heterogeneous nucleation has a discontinuity in its slope as the coexistence curve is crossed at constant temperature , when there is complete wetting .",
    "the rate of change of the nucleation rate in the vapour phase just below coexistence is not the same as its rate of change in the liquid phase just above coexistence . above and below",
    "mean at values of the chemical potential above and below that at coexistence .",
    "the rate of heterogeneous nucleation has a discontinuity as a first - order wetting transition is crossed .",
    "our model system is highly idealised , the surface is assumed perfectly smooth and homogeneous , and the dynamics of the formation of wetting layers have been neglected : the thickness was always taken to be at equilibrium .",
    "future work should address how the dynamics of formation of wetting layers can effect nucleation ; near a first - order wetting transition this will presumably be analogous to homogeneous nucleation near a metastable first - order bulk transition @xcite .",
    "also , an understanding of the effects of chemical heterogeneity and of curvature would be useful as in practice surfaces will not be perfectly homogeneous or smooth and heterogeneous nucleation can occur on particles whose surfaces are inherently curved .",
    "but the most urgent requirement is for experiments on heterogeneous nucleation on simple , well characterised surfaces .",
    "formation of the crystalline phase at the surface does not have to be an activated process . if the crystal itself wets the fluid - surface interface ( this is a distinct phenomenon from the wetting at vapour - liquid coexistence of the vapour - surface interface by the liquid ) then as the fluid - crystal transition is approached , a layer of the crystal forms at the surface and this can grow into a macroscopic crystal .",
    "for example , if we move along the path of the arrow in fig .",
    "[ mut ] , then as @xmath79 is approached from below , a layer of crystal forms at the surface and at @xmath80 there is a macroscopic crystal formed .",
    "then the crystalline phase forms at @xmath80 and there is no barrier to its formation . throughout this work",
    "we are assuming that the crystalline phase does not wet the fluid - surface interface .",
    "a mean - field theory @xcite for the variation of the barrier to homogeneous nucleation along the critical isotherm of a bulk critical point yields the same exponent as eq .",
    "( [ prewetdf ] ) .",
    "the exponent for the variation in the nucleation barrier along the critical isotherm was not calculated explicitly in either of refs .  @xcite but the exponent is implicit in eq .",
