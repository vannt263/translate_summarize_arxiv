    "be / x - ray binaries are x - ray sources composed of a be star and a neutron star .",
    "most of these systems are transient x - ray pulsars displaying strong outbursts in which their x - ray luminosity increases by a factor @xmath1 ( see negueruela 1998 ) . in addition , those systems in which the neutron star does not rotate fast enough for centrifugal inhibition of accretion to be effective ( see stella et al .",
    "1986 ) display persistent x - ray luminosity at a level @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the high - energy radiation is believed to arise due to accretion of material associated with the be star by the compact object .",
    "it has long been known that accretion from the fast polar wind that is detected in the uv resonance lines of the be primaries can not provide the observed luminosities , even for detections at the weakest level ( see waters et al .",
    "1988 and references therein ; see also the calculations made for x persei by telting et al .",
    "therefore it is believed that the material accreted comes from the dense equatorial disc that surrounds the be star .",
    "waters et al .",
    "( 1989 ) modelled the radial outflow as a relatively slow ( @xmath4 km s@xmath3 ) dense wind .",
    "however most modern models for be stars consider much slower outflows , due to strong evidence for rotationally dominated motion ( quasi - keplerian discs ) . this is due not only to the line shapes ( see hanuschik et al . 1996 ) , which set an upper limit on the bulk motion at @xmath5 ( hanuschik 2000 ) , but also to the success of the global one - armed oscillation model ( which can only work in quasi - keplerian discs ) at explaining v / r variability in be stars ( hummel & hanuschik 1997 ; okazaki 1997ab ) . the viscous decretion disc model ( okazaki 1997b ; porter 1999 ; negueruela & okazaki 2000 ) considers material in quasi - keplerian orbit with an initially very subsonic outflow velocity that is gradually accelerated by gas pressure and becomes supersonic at distances @xmath6 ,",

    "after its last giant outburst in february 1994 ( clark et al .",
    "1998 ; negueruela et al . 1998 ) , the strength of the emission lines in the optical spectrum of v725 tau has declined steadily . the last normal ( periodic ) outburst took place in september 1994 and the source has since not been detected by the batse experiment on board _",
    "v725 tau , the optical counterpart to a0535 + 26 , was observed on november 7th 1998 , using the 4.2-m william herschel telescope , located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma , spain . the telescope was equipped with the utrecht echelle spectrograph using the 31.6 lines / mm echelle centred at h@xmath0 and the site1 ccd camera .",

    "when in emission , these three lines sample most of the radial extent of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "however , it is apparent that the lines seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] correspond to photospheric absorption from the underlying star .",
    "the emission contribution from circumstellar material , if any , is certainly very small .",
    "the asymmetry in the shape of h@xmath0 and @xmath136678suggests that some fast - moving material is present close to the stellar surface ( see hanuschik et al . 1993 ; rivinius et al .",
    "1998 for the discussion of low - level activity in disc - less be stars ) , but the circumstellar disc is basically absent .",
    "h@xmath12 , which , when in emission , is typically produced at distances of a few @xmath14 , looks completely photospheric . in be stars h@xmath0 probes a region extending to @xmath15 , as measured from line - peak separation ( hummel & vrancken 1995 ) and direct imaging ( quirrenbach et al .",

    ".      the issue of whether the source of high energy radiation was active or not during the low activity optical phase can be solved by searching for the previously reported x - ray pulsations at @xmath19103.5-s spin period ( e.g. , finger et al . 1996 ) . in order to improve the signal - to - noise , we accumulated events from the top anode layer of the detectors .",
    "we also used the latest version of the faint background model .    for the power spectral analysis we selected a stretch of continuous data and divided it into intervals of 309 s.",
    "a power spectrum was obtained for each interval and the results averaged together . given that the pulse frequency ( @xmath20 hz ) lies on a region dominated by red noise , we have to correct for such noise if the statistical significance of the pulsations are to be established .",
    "first , we fitted the poisson level by restricting ourselves to the frequency range 0.20.4 hz , that is far away from the region where the red noise component may contribute appreciably .",
    "the strongest peak in the power spectrum corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "we also searched for periodicities in the light curves by folding the data over a period range and determining the @xmath22 of the folded light - curve ( epoch - folding technique ) . in this case",
    "we used 20 phase bins ( 19 degrees of freedom ) and a range of 100 periods , around the expected period .",
    "this method has the advantage that the result is not affected by the presence of gaps in the data , hence a longer baseline can be considered than with fourier analysis .",
    "times in the background subtracted light - curve were converted into times at the solar - system barycentre .",
    "the result for the 1998 november observation is shown in fig  [ fig : epoch ] .",
    "we found that the peak at @xmath23 is significant at @xmath24 , confirming that the source was active during the observations .",
    "( 250,280 ) ( 0,0 )    it is worth mentioning that the detection levels shown in fig .",

    "the analysis of the 1998 august observation provides a much less significant detection .",
    "a peak at the expected frequency ( @xmath26 hz ) is seen in the power spectrum .",
    "however , epoch - folding analysis gave a significance of @xmath27 only when we considered one single period , that is , the number of trials is one .",
    "a search for pulsations in a period range did not yield any maximum above the 3-@xmath28 detection level although a peak at the 103-s period is present ( see fig . [",

    "the amplitude of the modulation is @xmath29 count s@xmath3 in the 320 kev energy range , which implies a pulse fraction of @xmath30% .",
    "given the unknown contribution from galactic disc diffuse emission , this represents only a lower limit to the pulsed fraction in the signal from the source .",
    "we have divided the november 1998 observation into two sections , corresponding to the peak of the pulse ( phase bins 0.6 to 1.0 ) and the interpulse minimum ( phase bin 0.10.5 ) .",
    "an absorbed power - law fit in the energy range 2.710 kev to the two spectra gave @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( 18 dof ) for pulse maximum and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( 18 dof ) for pulse minimum .",
    "the two values are consistent with each other within the error margins .",

    "the value of the hydrogen column density ( @xmath37 ) , which is consistent for the power - law and bremsstrahlung fits , is too high to be purely interstellar .",
    "the interstellar reddening to the source must be smaller than the measured @xmath38 ( steele et al . 1998 ) , which is the sum of interstellar and circumstellar contribution from the disc surrounding the be star . according to the relation by bohlin et al .",

    "we first consider the possibility that the observed luminosity is due to accretion on to the surface of the neutron star .",
    "assuming an efficiency @xmath56 in the conversion of gravitational energy into x - ray luminosity , @xmath57 translates into an accretion rate @xmath58 .    following stella et al .",

    "the magnetospheric radius at which the magnetic field begins to dominate the dynamics of the inflow depends on the accretion rate and can be expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the neutron star magnetic moment and @xmath67 is the accretion rate .",
    "@xmath68 is a constant that in the case of a0535 + 26 has been determined to be @xmath69 when an accretion disc is present ( finger et al .",
    "1996 ) and from theoretical calculations is expected to have a similar value for wind accretion .",
    "following finger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we will assume a magnetic dipolar field @xmath70 , resulting in @xmath71",
    ".    for the accretion rate @xmath72 derived above , the magnetospheric radius would be @xmath73 .",
    "therefore @xmath74 and the neutron star must be in the centrifugal inhibition regime . in order to estimate the solidity of this result , we point out that if the 110 kev cyclotron line detected in the spectrum of a0535 + 26 ( kendziorra et al . 1994 ; grove et al .",
    "1995 ) is the second harmonic instead of the first , as has been suggested , the magnetic field ( and magnetic moment ) would be smaller by a factor 2 .",
    "however , this would require a higher value for @xmath68 in order to fit the observations of a qpo in this system ( finger et al .",
    "1996 ) , leaving the value of @xmath75 unaffected .",
    "an efficiency in the conversion of gravitational energy into radiation as low as @xmath76 will translate into a reduction in @xmath75 by only a factor @xmath77 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the neutron star is certain to be in the inhibited regime .    according to corbet ( 1996 ) ,",
    "when the source is in the inhibition regime , a luminosity comparable to that observed could be produced by release of gravitational energy at the magnetospheric radius ( for short , accretion onto the magnetosphere .",
    "however , even assuming that the magnetosphere is at the corotation radius and an efficiency @xmath56 ( i.e. , best case ) , in order to produce @xmath57 , the accretion rate needed is @xmath78 .",
    "with such an accretion rate , the magnetosphere would be driven in well within the corotation radius , and produce a luminosity of @xmath79 by accretion on to the surface of the neutron star .",
    "therefore we conclude that the observed luminosity is not due to accretion on to the magnetosphere .",
    "therefore we are left with the following possibilities for the origin of the x - ray emission :    * accretion on to the neutron star through some sort of leakage through the magnetospheric barrier .",
    "this could adopt two forms . either directly from the be star outflow and only through a fairly limited region near the spin axis or mediated by an accretion torus , supported by the centrifugal barrier , with a small amount of material managing to penetrate the magnetosphere . * thermal emission from the heated core of the neutron star .",
    "brown et al . ( 1998 ) and rutledge et al . (",
    "1999 ) have studied thermal emission from x - ray transients in quiescence .",
    "they predict a thermal luminosity in quiescence @xmath80 where @xmath67 here represents the long term average mass accretion rate . from the number of observed type ii outbursts in a0535 + 26 ,",
    "we assume one giant outburst every 510 years , which translates into a long - term average of @xmath81 .",
    "this would imply quiescence thermal emission in the range @xmath82 , which is consistent with our observations .",
    "it is very difficult to estimate the fraction of the signal that actually comes from the source , though the pulsed component is evidently a lower limit to it .",
    "the diffuse emission from the galactic disc is not well described at high galactic longitudes ( for a0535 + 26 , @xmath83 ) , but if the assumption by valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) that its latitude distribution should be similar to that in the galactic ridge can be held , then it should not be very strong at the position of a0535 + 26 ( @xmath84 ) . in any case , the total ( source + diffuse ) flux detected is lower than the average diffuse emission from the galactic ridge , which is @xmath85 in the 210 kev band ( valinia & marshall 1998 ) .",
    "given that the fitted spectra are much softer than the model fits to galactic ridge diffuse emission by valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) , which have photon indexes @xmath86 , and the similitude between the pulse - peak and pulse - minimum spectra , it seems likely that most of the detected signal comes actually from the source .",
    "the high value of @xmath37 obtained in all the non - thermal fits argues for the presence of large amounts of material in the vicinity of the neutron star .",
    "this could be caused by the pile - up of incoming material outside the magnetosphere . the observed spectrum is much softer than the spectra of be / x - ray binaries at low luminosity during quiescence states ( motch et al .",
    "1991 quote a photon index of 1.7 for their observations of a0535 + 26 ) and could favour the thermal emission interpretation .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed that thermal reactions deep within the crust of an accreting neutron star would maintain the neutron star core at temperatures of @xmath87 , similar to that in a young radio pulsar . during the quiescent state of transient accretors , the conduction of thermal energy from the core should result in a detectable thermal spectrum from the neutron star atmosphere .",
    "in a high magnetic field pulsar , this thermal emission should be pulsed due to both the anisotropic surface temperature distribution caused by the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the magnetic field ( shibanov & yakovlev 1996 ) , and the anisotropic radiation pattern from the neutron star atmosphere resulting from the magnetic field ( zavlin et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "our blackbody fit to the a0535 + 26 spectrum resulted in an emission radius much smaller than the neutron star .",
    "rutledge at al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that fits to hydrogen atmosphere spectral models result in larger emission areas and lower effective temperature than blackbody fits",
    ". the spectra may therefore be consistent with thermal emission from the pulsar .",
    "however , if this interpretation is correct , most of the emitted luminosity should be below the energy band that we observe . in that case , the bolometric luminosity may well exceed that predicted from our estimates of the long - term average accretion rates .",
    "our detection of a0535 + 26 can also be used to set limits on the outflow from the be companion .",
    "the condition for centrifugal inhibition is @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the minimum accretion rate at which there is no inhibition corresponds to that at which @xmath89 . using the values above",
    ", we obtain an accretion rate onto the magnetosphere @xmath90 .",
    "if the observed luminosity is due to accretion on to the surface of the neutron star , the rate of mass flow into the vicinity of the neutron star is then constrained to be in the range @xmath91 ( of course , if it is due to thermal emission , only the upper limit holds ) .",
    "the lower limit represents a small fraction of the mass lost from the be star ( which should be @xmath92 ) , but the upper limit is close to the mass - loss values derived in the decretion disc model ( okazaki 1997b ; porter 1999 ) .",
    "this value is also close to the accretion rate needed to sustain the quiescence luminosity observed by motch et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , which is @xmath93 .",
    "such an accretion rate would represent a substantial fraction of the stellar mass - loss , though still only a small fraction of the disc mass ( estimated to be @xmath94 ) . as has been calculated above ,",
    "most of the long - term accretion rate is due to the giant outbursts , where a substantial fraction of the be disc mass must be accreted .    from all the above ,",
    "it is clear that the amount of material reaching the vicinity of the neutron star during the disc - less phase of the companion is smaller than during previous quiescence states .",
    "this can not be due to an orbital effect because motch et al .",
    "( 1991 ) observed the source at different orbital times and also because our two observations took place close to periastron ( orbital phases @xmath95 for the august observation and @xmath96 for the november observation , according to the ephemeris of finger et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "existing evidence seems to argue against the existence of a persistent accretion disc surrounding the neutron star in a0535 + 26 .",
    "the statistical analysis of clark et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that there is no significant contribution from an accretion disc to the optical / infrared luminosity of a0535 + 26 .",
    "this does not rule out the presence of an accretion disc ( which could , for example , be too small to radiate a significant flux in comparison to the be circumstellar disc ) .",
    "it is believed that a0535 + 26 does indeed form an accretion disc around the neutron during type ii outbursts , since very fast spin - up and quasi - periodic oscillations have been observed ( finger et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , the lack of spin - up during type i outbursts led motch et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to conclude that no persistent accretion disc was present .",
    "in contrast , the be / x - ray binary 2s1845@xmath97024 shows large spin - up during every type i outburst ( finger et al .",
    "1999 ) . if no accretion disc is present , the reduced amount of material reaching the neutron star must be directly due to a change in the parameters of the outflow from the be star . within the framework of modern models for",
    "be star discs , considering very subsonic outflow velocities , such a change can only be due to a lower outflow density .",
    "unfortunately , since the details of the magnetic inhibition process are poorly understood , we can only constrain the mass rate reaching the neutron star to be below that corresponding to the transition at which inhibition occurs , which is very close to the rate deduced from previous quiescence observations in which the source was not in the inhibition regime .",
    "a0535 + 26 was active at a time when the optical counterpart v725 tau showed no evidence for a circumstellar disc .",
    "the luminosity was two orders of magnitude lower than in previous quiescence detections and accretion was centrifugally inhibited . given that the observed luminosity can not be due to accretion onto the magnetosphere , we are observing either some material leaking through the magnetosphere or thermal emission from the heated core of the neutron star . in any case , this detection represents a state of an accreting x - ray pulsar that had not been observed before .",
