    "new near - ir luminescence , quite different from much - studied bi@xmath2-related luminescence @xcite , was discovered in 2001 in bismuth - doped aluminosilicate glass @xcite .",
    "then optical amplification at 1.3  m was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "ever since bismuth - doped glasses and optical fibers based on such glasses attract a considerable interest due to a broadband ir luminescence in the range of 1.0  1.7  m employed successfully in fiber lasers and amplifiers ( see e.g. the review @xcite ) .    although the origin of the ir luminescence is still not clear , recently a belief has been strengthened that subvalent bismuth centers are responsible for the luminescence @xcite . in our opinion , monovalent bismuth centers are of a particular interest",
    ".    glasses as disordered systems are very complicated to study impurity centers structure . in this regard , crystals may be of interest as model hosts containing bismuth - related centers",
    ". in particular , crystalline halides of monovalent metals are convenient hosts for monovalent bismuth centers .",
    "these crystals have a simple structure ( primitive , , or face - centered , , cubic lattice ) .",
    "bismuth can easily form monovalent substitutional centers in such lattice .",
    "similar subvalent thallium and lead centers in crystals were studied extensively ( e.g. thallium in @xcite and lead in , m@xmath3ca , sr , ba @xcite ) . by analogy ,",
    "the models of bismuth - related centers in oxide glasses for fiber optics were suggested @xcite .",
    "bismuth - related ir luminescence in cubic halide crystals was studied for the first time in @xcite , then in ( ) @xcite and recently in ( ) @xcite .",
    "two models of the centers in were suggested in @xcite , namely , a monovalent bismuth substitutional center , @xmath0 , and a dimer center , @xmath1 , formed by two @xmath0 substitutional centers in the nearest cation sites with an extra electron . in what follows we report the results of computer modeling of bismuth - related centers in and crystals .",
    "to study the origin of the ir luminescence in and , we performed a computer simulation of the structure and absorption spectra of three bismuth - related centers possibly occurring in both crystals . basing on the assumptions made in @xcite and on analogy with centers in alkaline halide crystals ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we studied the @xmath0 substitutional center as the main form of bismuth embedding in and , the @xmath1 dimer center , and and complexes formed by the bismuth substitutional center and anion vacancy in its first coordination shell .",
    "the modeling was performed in a supercell approach .",
    "@xmath4 or supercells ( 54 atoms ) was chosen to model @xmath0 and or centers , and @xmath5 supercell ( 72 atoms ) was used for @xmath1 . in the central region of the supercell certain cations were substituted by bismuth atoms and an anion vacancy was formed by a removal of one chlorine or iodine atom .",
    "charged centers were simulated changing the total number of electrons in the supercell .",
    "equilibrium configurations of bismuth centers were found by a complete optimization of the supercell parameters and atomic positions with the gradient method .",
    "all such calculations were performed using package @xcite in the plane wave basis in the generalized gradient approximation of density functional theory with ultra - soft pseudopotentials built with pbe functional @xcite .",
    "the pseudopotential sources were taken from the pslibrary  v.  0.3.0 pseudopotential library @xcite .",
    "+    to test the approach , and lattice parameters were calculated for the unit cell and supercells with both atomic positions and cell parameters completely optimized .",
    "the results convergence was tested with respect to the plane wave cutoff energy and to the @xmath6 points grid .",
    "the energy cutoff @xmath7  ev and the number of @xmath6 points @xmath8 in the irreducible part of the unit cell brillouin zone were found to be enough to converge the total energy within @xmath9  ev per atom and to reproduce the experimental lattice parameters with a relative accuracy of @xmath10% .",
    "the geometry of each supercell was reproduced with a relative accuracy better than 2% with only @xmath11 point of the supercell taken into account and better than 1% using 8 @xmath6 points in the supercell in the irreducible part of the supercell brillouin zone .",
    "the total energy convergence was not worse than that in the case of the unit cell .",
    "configurations of bismuth - related centers obtained by this means were used to calculate the electron localization functions using the programs from package , the electron density distribution and effective charges of atoms by bader s method using bader  v.0.28 code @xcite , and the absorption spectra of the centers by bethe - salpeter equation method based on all - electron full - potential linearized augmented - plane wave approach @xcite .",
    "the absorption spectra calculations were performed using code @xcite in the local spin density approximation with pw - ca functional @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction essential for bismuth - containing systems was taken into account .",
    "scissor correction was applied to transition energies calculation with the scissor value found using modified becke - johnson exchange - correlation potential known to yield accurate band gaps in many solids @xcite .",
    "the non - overlapping muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres of maximal possible radii @xmath12 were used . convergence of the results was tested with respect to plane - wave cutoff energy , to the angular momentum cutoff for the mt density and potential , and to the @xmath6 points grid choice .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff , @xmath13 , was determined by the @xmath14 relation with @xmath15 being the smallest mt radius .",
    "the angular momentum cut - off was taken to be @xmath16 .",
    "the self - consistent calculations were performed on the @xmath17 grid of @xmath6 points uniformly distributed in the irreducible part of the supercell brillouin zone . further increasing the cutoff and @xmath6 points density did not lead to significant changes in the results .",
    "the total energy self - consistence tolerance was taken to be @xmath9  ev per atom .",
    "more dense @xmath18 @xmath6 points grid was applied to calculate dipole matrix elements in optical spectra calculations .",
    "simplified configurational coordinate diagrams of bismuth - related centers were calculated in a model restricted to the lowest excited states with a displacement of bismuth atom(s ) along @xmath19 $ ] axis for @xmath0 and centers and along @xmath20 $ ] axis for @xmath1 center . in spite of the fact that the model is inherently rough , it shows that in all the centers studied the stokes shift corresponding to a transition from the first excited state to the ground one do not exceed the accuracy of the excited state energy calculation .",
    "hence it seems reasonable enough to estimate the ir luminescence wavelengths by taking this stokes shift to be zero .",
    "calculation of @xmath0 substitutional center shows that both in and in the crystal lattice is distorted rather slightly around it : bismuth atom lies in the cation site , the nearest chlorine or iodine atoms are displaced by almost @xmath22 towards the bismuth cite , @xmath23 being the crystal lattice constant ( @xmath24  nm in and @xmath25  nm in ) , and the nearest thallium or cesium atoms are displaced apart from the bismuth cite .",
    "so bi@xmath26cl and bi@xmath26tl distances are 0.3120 and 0.3889  nm , respectively ( 0.3320 and 0.3834  nm in perfect crystal ) and bi@xmath26i and bi@xmath26cs distances are 0.3641 and 0.4624  nm , respectively ( 0.3955 and 0.4567  nm in perfect crystal ) .",
    "bader analysis of the electron density around @xmath0 center in showed the atomic effective charges to be @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 in -bismuth atom , in each of the nearest chlorine atoms , and in each of the nearest thallium atoms , respectively . the same analysis in yielded @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 atomic effective charges in bismuth atom , in each of the nearest iodine atoms , and in each of the nearest cesium atoms , respectively .",
    "the effective atomic charges in perfect and crystal lattices calculated by the same approach were found to be @xmath33 and @xmath29 in chlorine and thallium atoms , respectively , and @xmath34 and @xmath32 in iodine and cesium atoms , respectively .    in the total charge localized in cation",
    "cite and the neighboring anion sites was changed from @xmath35 in perfect lattice to @xmath36 in the lattice with bismuth substitutional center . in csi",
    "this total charge was changed from @xmath37 in perfect lattice to @xmath38 in the lattice with bismuth substitutional center .",
    "this shows that the electron density was displaced into the space between bismuth atom and the nearest anions and may be considered as slight covalent contribution to bi@xmath26cl and bi@xmath26i interaction . in such displacement is more noticeable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bi+_elfs ] ) .",
    "the calculated energy levels of the @xmath0 center in and are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bi+_tlcl_levels ] and [ fig : bi+_csi_levels ] , respectively , together with the corresponding transitions .",
    "it should be noticed that splitting of the @xmath0 ion states in bismuth substitutional centers in and is not described by crystal field theory due to total cubic symmetry of bismuth ion environment , unlike to the case of center @xcite . in this case",
    "the splitting is caused by electron density redistribution with a covalent contribution formed .",
    "absorption near 1.0 , 0.8 , 0.7 , and @xmath39  m is found in the @xmath0 center in .",
    "the above - mentioned excited states evaluative calculation allows one to expect a luminescence in near 1.0  m excited in this absorption bands . in the ir luminescence in the 1.21.3  m range may be expected to be excited in absorption bands near 1.2 , 0.7 , 0.5 , and @xmath40  m. besides , in another one luminescence transition , with much a lower lifetime , may occur near 0.8  m.      the modeling shows that the @xmath1 dimer centers can actually occur both in and crystals .    in @xmath1 centers",
    "the bismuth atoms are found to be displaced from the adjacent cation sites by @xmath42 and @xmath43 towards each other , so that the bi@xmath26bi distance is reduced to 0.2903 and 0.2961  nm in and , respectively .",
    "the nearest chlorine or iodine atoms are displaced towards the dimer , and the nearest thallium or cesium atoms are displaced apart from the dimer . as a result ,",
    "the bi@xmath26cl and bi@xmath26tl distances are 0.3060 and 0.3960  nm , respectively ( 0.3320 and 0.3834  nm , respectively , in perfect crystal ) , and the bi@xmath26i , and bi@xmath26cs distances become -0.3314 and 0.4743  nm , respectively , as compared to 0.3955 and 0.4567  nm , respectively , in perfect lattice .",
    "bader s method analysis of electron density around the center shows that the excess electron charge , @xmath44 , is localized almost completely in the first coordination shell of two bismuth sites , mainly in bismuth atoms and partially in the nearest chlorine or iodine atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bi2+_elfs ] ) . in the effective charge in each of the bismuth atoms",
    "is found to be @xmath45 , and the effective charge in each of the nearest chlorine and thallium atoms is @xmath33 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "so , as compared to @xmath0 center , positive charge in each of the bismuth atoms is decreased by @xmath47 , negative charge in each of the neighboring chlorine atoms is increased by @xmath48 , and positive charge in each of the nearest thallium atoms is decreased by @xmath49 . hence the excess total charge localized in two bismuth atoms and their nearest neighbors turns out to be @xmath50 . in the effective charge in each of the bismuth atoms",
    "is @xmath51 , and the effective charge in each of the nearest iodine and cesium atoms is @xmath28 and @xmath52 , respectively . as compared to @xmath0 center , positive charge in each of the bismuth atoms",
    "is decreased by @xmath53 , negative charge in each of the neighboring iodine atoms is increased by @xmath48 , and positive charge in each of the nearest cesium atoms is decreased by @xmath49 .",
    "so the excess total charge in two bismuth atoms and their environment is @xmath54 .",
    "so the center is actually @xmath1 dimer both in and in .",
    "however , again a certain part of the electron density is displaced into the space between bismuth atoms and the nearest anions , as in @xmath0 centers .",
    "the calculated energy levels of @xmath1 center in and and the corresponding transitions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bi_2+_tlcl_levels ] and [ fig : bi_2+_csi_levels ] , respectively . basing on the evaluative calculations of the first excited state one might expect the ir luminescence bands in near 1.1 and 1.3  m excited in absorption near 1.1 , 0.8 , 0.7 , 0.5 and @xmath55  m , and in near 1.2 and 1.6  m excited in absorption near 1.2 , 0.7 , 0.6 , and @xmath56  m. one more luminescence band near @xmath57  m in and in the @xmath58  m range in corresponding to a transition from the lowest excited state might be observable at a low temperature .",
    "+      the modeling of the complexes shows that the complexes in and differ significantly in electronic and spectral properties .",
    "the complex in turns out to be similar in certain respect to centers in alkali halide crystals .",
    "however , the complex in differs strikingly from both the and centers .    in the complex in the lattice relaxation turns out to be significant .",
    "the bismuth atom is displaced by @xmath59 from cation site towards the vacant chlorine site , the nearest chlorine and thallium atoms are displaced towards bismuth atom , and thallium atoms surrounding chlorine vacancy are displaced apart from the vacant site .",
    "this results in bi@xmath26cl , bi@xmath26tl , and @xmath60 distances being 0.3024 , 0.3598 , and 0.4009  nm , respectively , as compared to the distances 0.3320 , 0.3834 , and 0.3320  nm in perfect crystal .",
    "the relaxation is accompanied by the electron density shifted from bismuth atom into the chlorine vacancy region , so that the complex center may be thought of as a bound pair of ions , @xmath0 plus negatively charged v@xmath61 vacancy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bi_and_vac_tlcl_elf ] ) .",
    "thus this center is a complex .    in complex in , on the one hand ,",
    "the lattice relaxation is as significant as that in center .",
    "bismuth atom is displaced by @xmath43 from the cation site towards the vacant iodine site , the nearest iodine atoms are displaced towards bismuth atom , but the nearest cesium atoms are displaced apart from bismuth atom .",
    "this results in bi@xmath26cs and bi@xmath26i distances decreased to 0.4220 and 0.3509  nm , respectively , from 0.4567 and 0.3955  nm , respectively , in perfect crystal . on the other hand , the electron density distribution turns out to differ strikingly from that in complex in crystal . as distinct from , the electron density in",
    "is not redistributed between bismuth atom and anion vacancy .",
    "so the complex may be roughly thought of as a bound pair : a neutral substitutional atom , @xmath62 , and a neutral iodine vacancy , v@xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bi_and_vac_csi_elf ] ) .",
    "in other words , this center turns out to be a complex .",
    "bader s method analysis of the electron density distribution around the center confirms these conclusions . in the effective charge of bismuth atom",
    "is @xmath52 , effective charge of each of the nearest chlorine atoms is @xmath28 , and effective charge of each of the thallium atoms surrounding the chlorine vacancy is @xmath64 .",
    "so the excess ( in comparison with perfect lattice ) positive charge localized in bismuth substitutional atom and its nearest neighbors is about @xmath65 , and the negative charge no less than @xmath66 is localized in the chlorine vacancy and in its nearest neighbors . in the effective charge of bismuth atom is @xmath67 , effective charge of each of the nearest iodine atoms is @xmath68 , and effective charge of each of the cesium atoms surrounding the iodine vacancy is @xmath52 .",
    "so the bismuth substitutional atom turns out to be practically a neutral atom , the excess ( in comparison with perfect lattice ) positive charge localized in its nearest neighbors is about @xmath69 and the positive charge no less than @xmath70 is localized in the iodine vacancy and in its nearest neighbors .",
    "the calculated energy levels of and centers and the corresponding transitions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bi_and_vac_tlcl_levels ] and [ fig : bi_and_vac_csi_levels ] , respectively .",
    "spectral properties of the and complexes may be understood in a model similar to center theory @xcite . in such a model the complexes",
    "are considered as @xmath0 ion or @xmath62 atom , respectively , in the axial crystal field formed by neighboring chlorine or iodine vacancy . obviously , the crystal field of a negatively changed chlorine vacancy is stronger than that of a neutral iodine vacancy .",
    "three lowest states of @xmath0 ion are known to arise from atomic state split by strong spin - orbital interaction in bismuth .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0 ion is .",
    "the first excited state , , is split by an axial crystal field in two levels , 6100 and 8300  @xmath71 , and the second excited state , , is split in three levels , 12500 , 14900 and 25000  @xmath71 . in a free @xmath0 ion the electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions between three spin - orbital components of the state",
    "are forbidden but under the influence of the crystal field the transitions become allowed . basing on the above - mentioned evaluative calculations one expects the ir luminescence in two bands near 1.6 and 1.2  m , both excited in absorption near 0.8 , 0.7 , and @xmath55  m.",
    "a luminescence band with a significantly shorter ( by an order of magnitude ) lifetime may occur near 0.8  m.    the ground state of @xmath62 atom is known to be .",
    "the first excited state , , is split by an axial crystal field in two levels , 9000 and 10100  @xmath71 .",
    "the second excited state , , is split in three levels , 16000 , 18000 , and 19300  @xmath71 , and the forth excited state , , is not split by an electrostatic field .",
    "notice that the splitting is expected to be considerably slighter than that in complex .",
    "e1 transitions from the ground state of center , corresponding to the atomic state , to all the states arising from the one , turn out to be weak since in a free atom such transitions are parity - forbidden .",
    "hence the only relatively intensive absorption band near 0.43  m corresponding to @xmath72 transition may be expected to occur in the center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bi_and_vac_csi_levels ] ) . with the above - mentioned evaluative calculations taken into account",
    "one might expect that 1.0  1.1  m luminescence corresponding to @xmath72 transitions is excited in this absorption band .",
    "spectroscopic data @xcite and the present results of modeling of bismuth - related centers in and crystals suggest that different centers are responsible for the near - infrared luminescence in these crystals .",
    "in the luminescence observed near 1.2  m is caused mainly by complexes formed by @xmath0 substitutional ions and negatively charged chlorine vacancies .",
    "however , the bismuth - related contribution to the total absorption is caused mainly by single @xmath0 substitutional centers not contributing to the ir luminescence .",
    "this explains a significant difference between the ir luminescence excitation spectrum and absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 substitutional centers may cause a luminescence near 1.0  m not observed in @xcite .    in the ir luminescence",
    "is caused mainly by two types of bismuth centers : @xmath0 substitutional centers give rise to a luminescence observed in the 1.2  1.3  m range , and @xmath1 dimer centers cause a luminescence observed near 1.2  m and near 1.6  m. these conclusions agree with the experimental data of @xcite and confirm the assumptions made there . besides , dimer centers may cause possible luminescence in the @xmath73  m range not observed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "complexes formed in by @xmath62 substitutional atoms and neutral iodine vacancies may contribute to the ir luminescence only near 1.0  m , as distinct from crystals .",
    "one might suppose that the luminescence in the 0.95  1.15  m range observed in @xcite at a low temperature under 0.4  0.5  m excitation is contributed by centers formed due to electrons capturing in @xmath0 substitutional centers in the vicinity of iodine vacancies .",
