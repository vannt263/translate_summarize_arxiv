    "one of the most striking features of qcd is asymptotic freedom : the force between quarks becomes arbitrarily weak as the characteristic momentum scale of their interaction grows larger .",
    "this immediately suggests that at sufficiently high densities and low temperatures , matter will consist of a fermi sea of essentially free quarks , whose behavior is dominated by the high - momentum quarks that live at the fermi surface .",
    "however , over the last few years it has become clear that the phase diagram of qcd is much richer than this .",
    "in addition to the hadronic phase with which we are familiar and the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) that is predicted to lie at temperatures above @xmath1 , there is a whole family of `` color superconducting '' phases , that are expected to occur at high density and low temperature @xcite .",
    "the essence of color superconductivity is quark pairing , driven by the bcs mechanism , which operates when there exists an attractive interaction between fermions at a fermi surface .",
    "the qcd quark - quark interaction is strong , and is attractive in many channels , so we expect cold dense quark matter to _ generically _ exhibit color superconductivity .",
    "moreover , quarks , unlike electrons , have color and flavor as well as spin degrees of freedom , so many different patterns of pairing are possible .",
    "this leads us to expect a rich phase structure in matter beyond nuclear density .",
    "color superconducting quark matter may occur naturally in the universe , in the cold dense cores of compact ( `` neutron '' ) stars , where densities are above nuclear density , and temperatures are of the order of tens of kev .",
    "( it might conceivably be possible to create it in future low - energy heavy ion colliders , such as the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) or the compressed baryonic matter facility at gsi darmstadt . ) up to now , most work on signatures has focussed on properties of color superconducting quark matter that would affect observable features of compact stars , and i will discuss some of these below .",
    "in the real world there are two light quark flavors , the up ( @xmath2 ) and down ( @xmath3 ) , with masses @xmath4 , and a medium - weight flavor , the strange ( @xmath5 ) quark , with mass @xmath6 .",
    "the strange quark therefore plays a crucial role in the phases of qcd , and we expect it to remain fully paired with the light flavors as long as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a gap parameter for the pairing of the strange quark .",
    "[ fig : phase ] shows two conjectured phase diagrams for qcd .",
    "one panel is for small @xmath9 , in which case the strange quark s mass never breaks its pairing with the light flavors , so there is a direct transition from nuclear matter to color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) quark matter @xcite . in the cfl",
    "phase the strange quark participates symmetrically with the up and down quarks in cooper pairing  this is described in more detail in section [ sec : cfl ] .",
    "the other panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] is for large @xmath9 , in which case the strange quark is too heavy to pair symmetrically with the light quarks at medium densities , then there will be an interval of some other phase or phases .",
    "these may well include the recently proposed gapless cfl phase @xcite , which will be described in section [ sec : gcfl ] , although other possibilities such as crystalline color superconductivity @xcite or some form of single - flavor pairing @xcite have been suggested .",
    "the essential physics of color superconductivity is the same as that underlying conventional superconductivity in metals @xcite . as mentioned above , asymptotic freedom of qcd",
    "means that at sufficiently high density and low temperature , there is a fermi surface of almost free quarks .",
    "the interactions between quarks near the fermi surface are certainly attractive in some channels ( quarks bind together to form baryons ) and it was shown by bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite that if there is _ any _ channel in which the interaction is attractive , then there is a state of lower free energy than a simple fermi surface .",
    "that state arises from a complicated coherent superposition of pairs of particles ( and holes)``cooper pairs '' .",
    "attractive interactions play a crucial role in the bcs mechanism for the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "this can easily be understood in an intuitive way .",
    "the helmholtz free energy is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total energy of the system , @xmath12 is the chemical potential , and @xmath13 is the number of fermions .",
    "the fermi surface is defined by a fermi energy @xmath14 , at which the free energy is minimized , so adding or subtracting a single particle costs zero free energy .",
    "now switch on a weak attractive interaction .",
    "it costs no free energy to add a pair of particles ( or holes ) , and if they have the right quantum numbers then the attractive interaction between them will lower the free energy of the system .",
    "many such pairs will therefore be created in the modes near the fermi surface , and these pairs , being bosonic , will form a condensate . the ground state will be a superposition of states with all numbers of pairs , breaking the fermion number symmetry .",
    "since pairs of quarks can not be color singlets , the resulting condensate will break the local color symmetry @xmath15 .",
    "we call this `` color superconductivity '' . note that the quark pairs play the same role here as the higgs particle does in the standard model :",
    "the color - superconducting phase can be thought of as the higgs phase of qcd .",
    "the favored pairing pattern at high densities , where the strange quark fermi momentum is close to the up and down quark fermi momenta , is `` color - flavor locking '' ( cfl ) @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by both njl @xcite and gluon - mediated interaction calculations @xcite .",

    "the term multiplied by @xmath20 corresponds to pairing in the @xmath21 , which although not energetically favored breaks no additional symmetries and so @xmath20 is in general small but not zero @xcite .",
    "the kronecker deltas connect color indices with flavor indices , so that the condensate is not invariant under color rotations , nor under flavor rotations , but only under simultaneous , equal and opposite , color and flavor rotations .",
    "since color is only a vector symmetry , this condensate is only invariant under vector flavor+color rotations , and breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "the features of the cfl pattern of condensation are    * the color gauge group is completely broken .",
    "all eight gluons become massive .",
    "this ensures that there are no infrared divergences associated with gluon propagators . *",
    "all the quark modes are gapped .",
    "the nine quasiquarks ( three colors times three flavors ) fall into an @xmath22 of the unbroken global @xmath23 , so there are two gap parameters .",
    "the singlet has a larger gap than the octet .",
    "* a rotated electromagnetism ( `` @xmath24 '' ) survives unbroken .",
    "it is a combination of the original photon and one of the gluons . *",
    "two global symmetries are broken , the chiral symmetry and baryon number , so there are two gauge - invariant order parameters that distinguish the cfl phase from the qgp , and corresponding goldstone bosons which are long - wavelength disturbances of the order parameter .",
    "when the light quark mass is non - zero it explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry and gives a mass to the chiral goldstone octet , but the cfl phase is still a superfluid , distinguished by its baryon number breaking . *",
    "the symmetries of the 3-flavor cfl phase are the same as those one might expect for 3-flavor hypernuclear matter @xcite , so it is possible that there is no phase transition between them .    in a real compact star",
    "we must require electromagnetic and color neutrality @xcite ( possibly via mixing of oppositely - charged phases ) , allow for equilibration under the weak interaction , and include a realistic mass for the strange quark .",
    "these factors tend to pull apart the fermi momenta of the different quark species , imposing an energy cost on cross - species pairing .",
    "the requirement of neutrality penalizes the 2sc phase relative to the cfl phase .",
    "this can be shown by analyzing a generic expansion of the free energy in powers of @xmath25 @xcite or by an njl calculation @xcite that handles @xmath26 and includes the coupling between the chiral condensate and quark condensate gap equations .",
    "the net result , assuming that mixed phases are excluded by the surface energy cost @xcite ( see section .  [ sec : phenomenology ] ) , is that there is no ( or very little ) density range in which 2sc is the phase with the lowest free energy : unpaired or cfl - paired quark matter are generally favored over 2sc .      introducing a strange quark mass leads to new color - superconducting phases .",
    "the dimensionless parameter that expresses the effect of the strange quark mass is @xmath27 , which tells us how the pairing gap @xmath8 of the strange quark compares with the amount by which the strange quark mass is trying to separate the strange quark fermi surface from those of the light quarks .",
    "in reality , both @xmath28 and @xmath8 will depend on @xmath12 , but in the rest of this section we will treat @xmath28 as a parameter , and discuss the effects of varying @xmath29 , invoking model - independent arguments as well as results from a njl model in which the pairing gap at @xmath30  mev and @xmath31 is @xmath32  mev .    at very high densities",
    "the strange quark mass is small relative to the chemical potential ( @xmath33 ) and it may , depending on the size of instanton effects @xcite , induce a flavor rotation of the cfl condensate known as `` kaon condensation '' @xcite , which breaks isospin . as one reduces the density",
    "( increasing @xmath29 ) the strange quark mass becomes more important , and it now seems @xcite that there is a smooth transition into a gapless cfl phase `` gcfl '' at @xmath34 .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below . at lower densities things",
    "become complicated .",
    "the strange quark mass and the requirements of color and electric neutrality impose a free energy cost for keeping the fermi momenta of different flavors locked together so that they can pair with each other , and when @xmath29 is large this cost is too great to be compensated by the resultant pairing energy .",
    "one might expect the strange quark to decouple first , leading to `` 2sc '' pairing between up and down only @xcite , but neutrality constraints disfavor this @xcite .",
    "however , we do not expect the favored phase in this region to be rigorously unpaired",
    ". there may be a range of @xmath29 in which the different flavors are able to maintain some pairing by switching from bcs pairing to `` loff '' crystalline pairing , involving only part of the fermi surface @xcite ( see section  [ sec : phenomenology ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that each flavor simply pairs with itself @xcite .",
    "at some point that can not be predicted with current techniques , there will be a transition from quark matter to baryonic matter .",
    "the gapless cfl phase , then , is the `` medium - high density '' phase of qcd .",

    "in fact , for the case where there are perturbative corrections but no color superconductivity the equations of state ( @xmath116 ) are so similar that our program found a series of phase transitions back and forth between cfl and apr98 up to @xmath117 ( baryon density @xmath118 ) .",
    "this is why the @xmath115 red dotted curve lies almost exactly on top of the solid black ( apr98 ) curve , even though there was a phase transition from apr98 to cfl at @xmath112 ( which is first attained when the apr98 star reaches a mass of @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) .",
    "* _ what would rule out quark matter ? _",
    "+ from fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1.5 ] we see that an observed mass @xmath121 would be inconsistent with the star containing quark matter obeying the equation of state that we have studied here . however , we emphasize that by introducing the parameter @xmath102 and setting it to a reasonable value @xmath114 we have increased the mass range for hybrid stars , moving the upper limit from its old value around @xmath122 up to about @xmath0 . *",
    "_ what would indicate the presence of quark matter ? _ + this is difficult .",
    "regions of @xmath96-@xmath97 space that can not be reached by any nuclear matter equation of state also can not be reached by hybrid nm - qm equations of state .",

    "[ fig : rho1.5 ] and [ fig : massradius ] that hybrid stars are smaller than walecka or apr98 nuclear matter stars , with radii of around @xmath123 at @xmath124 .",
    "but there are many other suggested nuclear equations of state , and the flattening of the @xmath95 curve that appears in our plots to be characteristic of quark matter may easily be mimicked by kaon condensation in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "+ obviously the region of pure quark matter objects which lie at very low mass and radius ( `` strangelets '' ) is not attainable by nuclear matter , but the existence of such objects , unlike that of compact stars , remains a matter of speculation .",
    "* _ what would indicate the presence of quark matter ? _ + this is more difficult .",
    "even if we found an @xmath95 characteristic of quark matter , we would need an independent determination of the bag constant to claim that it was color - superconducting .",
