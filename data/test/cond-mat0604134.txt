    "a possible direct transition between the dimer phase to the neel phase has been estimated to lie at @xmath113 .",

    "albrecht and mila used schwinger boson mean field theory to argue in favor of a first order transition between the dimer state into a helical state and a second order transition to a neel state .",
    "another possible intermediate state , the plaquette singlet phase was discussed by koga and kawakimi in ref .  .",

    "applying variational peps to the shastry - sutherland model is straight forward .",
    "two issues should be noted .",
    "first , we stress again that the computational lattice does not need to have the same bond - configuration as the underlying hamiltonian . for the purpose of studying the shastry - sutherland model",
    "it is sufficient to use an ordinary square lattice as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_lattice ] .",
    "it is easy to show that already with a low tensor dimension @xmath0 it is possible to represent exactly the dimerized ground state with singlets on all diagonal bonds .",
    "the second issue regards boundary conditions . in implementing the algorithm",
    "we have used a computational lattice with open boundary conditions .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold .",
    "firstly , using a computational lattice with periodic boundary conditions severely reduces the performance of the algorithm , the difference being that between matrix - vector multiplications rather than matrix - matrix multiplications .",
    "secondly , our program suffers from stability problems arising due to ill - conditioning and round - off errors in the case of computational lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "although , the computational lattice does not have periodic boundary conditions it is not necessary to adopt the same boundary conditions to the hamiltonian . in this study",
    "we have used two different physical boundary conditions , open and periodic . for the open bc",
    "we have adopted the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc](a ) while for the periodic the geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc](b ) .",
    "the interpretation of using periodic bc in the physical problem while using open bc in the computational lattice is reminiscent of using a self - consistent field on the boundary .",
    "the bonds across the boundary have only a tensor dimension @xmath116 which in the limit of large lattices implies that the contribution from a such a bond will approach the product form @xmath117 for limited @xmath4 .    we have mainly restricted ourselves to using a tensor - dimension @xmath0 for which a usual work - station with 1 gb of internal memory suffices . although our program can in principle handle @xmath118 ( see section .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] ) , it is in its present incarnation too slow and unstable for @xmath118 . for the dimension of effective mpo : s when calculating effective operators we have used a variable @xmath119 for all simulations except for the largest ( @xmath120 ) systems where the 1 gb memory limit restricts us to @xmath121 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : en_obc ] the lowest energies obtained by the algorithm for @xmath0 are shown for system sizes of @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath120 with both open ( main panel ) and periodic boundary conditions ( inset ) . the total energy has been scaled by the number of internal diagonal bonds @xmath125 and the coupling energy @xmath126 . as can be seen , for low @xmath127 the ground state energy approaches -3/8@xmath126 for the system with open boundary conditions confirming the convergence to the dimerized ground state . from the graph obtained using open boundary conditions it can be seen that already for @xmath0 we find a phase transition from the dimerized state . the transition point being located at @xmath128 which is in agreement with estimates for the transition point of the direct dimer - neel transition .",
    "further , in the energy a clear finite size effect is seen as the transition point is approached .    from the inset showing the energies",
    "obtained using periodic boundary conditions the location and nature of the transition is less clear .",
    "here we have again divided the total energy by the number of internal diagonal bonds . since the diagonal bonds across the boundary",
    "are not counted this gives rise to energies lower than @xmath129 .",
    "the transition is revealed by looking at the strength of the diagonal singlets and the staggered magnetization , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : en_pbc ] .",
    "the singlet mixing is calculated by projecting the diagonal bonds on to the singlet state , i.e. 1 indicates a singlet while 0 indicates a triplet .",
    "the staggered magnetization displayed is calculated as @xmath130 .",
    "note that for large @xmath127 the staggered magnetization is higher than the value expected for a heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the reason for this can be two - fold .",
    "firstly , finite size effects explain a part of the discrepancy as can be seen from the graph . secondly ,",
    "while @xmath0 gives a good value for the energies involved , being only a few percent off the exact values , observables may differ by more ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] ) .    as stated in section  [ sec : ss_model ] , there are good reasons to believe that an intermediate phase exists between the dimer phase and the neel phase .",
    "however , it is hardly surprising that we do nt see this intermediate phase in our @xmath0 variational calculation .",
    "first of all , with tensor dimension @xmath0 we typically overshoot the true ground state energy by a few percent , thus higher @xmath4 is likely needed to capture any additional phase that may differ by a percent or less in energy .",
    "second , the influence of boundary conditions scales as @xmath131 which implies that boundary effects can have a big impact even for the largest systems ( @xmath132 ) in cases where the energy splittings between ground state candidates are small .",
    "to study the magnetization curve we have deliberately chosen a somewhat smaller coupling constant @xmath133 than the experimental value @xmath134 .",
    "this makes the dimer state more stable and the algorithm converges faster but should not significantly affect the physics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : magncurve ] we show the results for a finite magnetic field for systems with periodic boundary conditions of sizes @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( @xmath0 ) . although our square geometry and ( periodic ) boundary conditions are inconsistent with the unit cells proposed in refs .",
    "a clear step like structure is nevertheless visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : magncurve ] .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that _ locally _ the spin configurations we have obtained match those in ref .   very well .    to study the spin configurations at the plateaus we have visualized the wave functions by coloring the bonds according to the amount of triplet or singlet mixing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magncurve ] ) .",
    "localized singlets are drawn in red whereas triplets are blue . to determine the color of a bond we use the following criterion @xmath135",
    "furthermore we have measured the spin component parallel to the direction of the applied field ( @xmath136 ) and visualized @xmath137 by circles with radii proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "spins aligned ( anti - aligned ) with the field are drawn as filled ( open ) circles .    for small fields , @xmath139 , we see a finite magnetization where one would expect a spin gap .",
    "this is due to the inability of our trial states to form singlets across the boundary .",
    "as can be seen in the inset , for @xmath139 the interior of the system is still in the dimer phase while only spins on the boundary have aligned with the field .",
    "thus , by looking at when the magnetization in the interior of the system becomes finite we estimate the spin gap to be roughly @xmath140 corresponding to 33 t where we have used coupling constants @xmath141 k , @xmath142 ( with j=71k the corresponding number is 28 t ) .    for @xmath143 three steps",
    "can be distinguished , 1/4 , 1/3 and 1/2 . while the spin texture at 1/2 matches that of earlier predictions , half of the diagonal bonds being triplets while the other half being singlets , the spin textures for other points are more elaborate and only agrees with earlier predictions locally .",
    "an example is shown in the top left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : magncurve ] . here",
    ", three of the 1/3 unit cells obtained by miyahara et al  @xcite are reproduced in the interior of the @xmath124 system .",
    "note that the total magnetization is larger than 1/3 at this point due to the spin configurations on the boundary .",
    "the spin textures obtained at the steps can only be found when translational symmetry is broken . in the variational method employed here translational symmetry is broken partly because of our choice of computational lattice and boundary conditions , and partly because a @xmath0 peps can not represent the coherent superposition of degenerate plateau states connected by global symmetry transformations .",
    "so far we have only concerned ourselves with @xmath0 which is the first step beyond a simple on - site factorizable wave function . restricting ourselves to @xmath0 and sizes up to @xmath120 allows the program to run on an ordinary workstation with 1 gb internal memory without using any swapping to disk .    because the method is based on a sequence of approximations , i.e. , for a 12x12 system there are over 700 contributions to the effective hamiltonian on any given site , each contribution being obtained in a series of up to 10 consecutive approximations one has to ask whether or not the precision is compromised . another important factor to consider is how much more accuracy ( how much closer to the true ground state energy we can come ) can be obtained by increasing @xmath4 , and how the computational effort scales with increasing @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] the energy as a function of number of optimizations is shown for a @xmath124 system with @xmath144 . while smooth on a large scale , the errors accumulated in the successive approximations are clearly visible in the inset which shows a closeup of the final convergence . in this simulation and others",
    "we have used a final dimension in the approximation of @xmath52-tensors ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : peps ] ) @xmath119 ( for @xmath120 we have been restricted to @xmath121 due to the limited memory ( 1 gb ) of the workstation ) . as can be seen , despite the heavy reduction of the state space in the calculations , we have a precision of the order of 4 digits",
    ". this can also be seen by looking at the norm of the wave function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : normdev ] the deviation of the norm from the nominal value 1 is shown for the simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] .    to estimate the accuracy ,",
    "i.e. how close to the true ground state energy the variational peps algorithm can get we have compared it to qmc on an ordinary heisenberg antiferromagnet ( qmc being unable to handle the ss - model ) , @xmath145 with open boundary conditions .",
    "the qmc was run at an inverse temperature of @xmath146 and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmc_comp ] where the quantity @xmath147 is shown for different system sizes and tensor dimensions @xmath4 . for the smallest system @xmath148 sites we find good agreement with the figures reported in ref .",
    "obtained using imaginary time evolution .",
    "we further note that as the system size is increased the relative error decreases slightly , and that a linear increase in @xmath4 seems to give an exponential increase in accuracy .",
    "we want to point out that although the energies obtained by peps are in good agreement with exact results , observables may deviate more . in the left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : qmc_comp ] the staggered magnetization for the heisenberg model is compared with the staggered magnetization obtained using @xmath0 peps .",
    "compared to the accuracy in energy which is of the order one percent ( see main panel ) the error in the staggered magnetization is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "although the above comparison for the heisenberg model does not , in a strict sense , tell us anything about the accuracy obtained for the ss - model away from the limit @xmath149 it still serves as a good indication on the general behavior as one varies @xmath150 and @xmath4 . for the ss - model we have compared with exact diagonalization results obtained using spinpack  @xcite at @xmath151 using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the comparison is shown in the right inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : qmc_comp ] .",
    "the internal tensor dimension @xmath4 plays an important role in how faithfully a peps can represent ground states .",
    "the algorithm scales very badly with increasing @xmath4 , the bottle neck being the contraction of two rows ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : u21 ] ) .",
    "to form an mpo by contracting two rows requires of the order @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) and scaling with @xmath4 is at best @xmath154 .",
    "this then sets a limit to the maximum internal dimensions that can be practically used and the large values of @xmath155 used in 1d variational mps can not be reached . however , as we have seen here ( see also ref .  ) , for 2d peps we expect small @xmath156 to be able capture the essential physics for many problems with short range interactions .",
    "the scaling of the algorithm with linear system size is @xmath157 and is less severe .",
    "all simulations were run on linux workstations with 2.0 ghz amd athlon processor and 1 gb of internal memory .",
    "on such a machine the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] took 96h to produce .",
    "finally we comment on the stability of the algorithm .",
    "we have found that the technique used to optimize tensors one by one often becomes unstable and may not be the optimal way to find the ground state .",
    "it may well be that using imaginary time evolution is a more effective way .",
    "we have applied a variational procedure based on projected entangled pair states ( peps ) to study the ground state properties of a frustrated spin system , the shastry - sutherland model . using the smallest nontrivial dimension on the tensors @xmath0 a direct phase transition between the dimer state and the neel state can be observed , the location being well in agreement with other theoretical estimates for a direct transition .",
    "within @xmath0 we see no clear indication of an intermediate phase which may require higher @xmath4 , larger systems , or proper handling of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also find that already with peps @xmath0 , magnetization plateaus are possible to reproduce , and that the non - trivial spin textures associated with these plateaus can be seen .",
    "furthermore we have examined the performance of the algorithm and conclude that it degrades rather severely for intermediate to large values of the internal dimension @xmath4 . however",
    ", this scaling of the performance degradation might not be so restrictive as already the @xmath0 class of peps is well suited for studies of frustrated spin systems at a level beyond mean field theory .",
    "the method can readily be extended to other 2d frustrated spin - models ."
