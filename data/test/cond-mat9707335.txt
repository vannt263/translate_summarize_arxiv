    "the 2-leg , @xmath2 ladder represents one of the simplest systems which exhibits some of the phenomena associated with high @xmath3 cuprate superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the undoped system , a 2-leg heisenberg ladder , is a spin liquid with a finite spin gap and exponentially decaying antiferromagnetic spin - spin correlations . upon doping ,",
    "the spin gap remains and there appear power law cdw and singlet superconducting pairing correlations .",
    "in addition , the pairing correlations have an internal @xmath4-like symmetry with a relative sign difference between the leg and rung singlets which make up a pair .",
    "despite all of the numerical and analytical work which has been done on this system , we still lack a picture of the ground state which accommodates all of these physical properties .",
    "there are , however , many hints of what that picture may look like .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to take one step further in that direction .",
    "short - range resonating valence bonds ( rvb ) provide a useful basis for representing the ground state of spin liquids@xcite . for the @xmath2 ladder , a @xmath5-order picture has been provided by the study of the strong coupling limit where the exchange coupling constant along the rungs , @xmath6 , is much larger than any other scale in the problem .",
    "the other coupling constants of the model are , @xmath1 : the exchange coupling constant along the legs , and @xmath0 and @xmath7 : the hopping parameters along the legs and the rungs respectively . in the limit @xmath8 , the ground state of the undoped ladder",
    "is simply given by the coherent superposition of singlets across the rungs .",
    "addition of one hole requires the breaking of one of these singlets , in which case the hole gets effectively bound to the unpaired spin , becoming a quasiparticle with spin @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 .",
    "addition of another hole leads to the binding of two holes in the same rung in order to minimize the cost in energy . in this picture",
    "there is no spin - charge separation , a fact that remains valid down to intermediate and weak couplings , as confirmed by various numerical and analytical studies .",
    "based on this picture it is possible to construct an effective theory describing the motion and interactions of the hole pairs @xcite .",
    "it is given by a hard - core boson model ( hcb ) characterized by an effective hopping parameter @xmath11 and interaction @xmath12 of the hole pairs .",
    "the hcb model describes the doped ladder as a luther - emery liquid , with gapped spin excitations and gapless charge collective modes , which are responsible for the cdw and sc power law correlations .",
    "we summarize the @xmath5-order picture in figure 1 , which shows a typical state of hcb s , as well as the two building blocks that are used its construction .    in order to go beyond this picture",
    ", we need to consider the fluctuations of the states of the hcb model .",
    "to lowest order in perturbation theory they are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the admixture of the state shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) is of order @xmath13 and represents a resonance of two nearest neighbor rung singlets .",
    "according to the standard rvb scenario , this resonance effect leads to a substantial lowering of the ground state energy .",
    "the state in fig .",
    "2(b ) is of order @xmath14 , and it can be though of as a bound state of two quasiparticles , whose characteristic feature is the diagonal frustrating bond across the holes . from the rvb point of view ,",
    "2(b ) is a resonance of a singlet and a hole pair .",
    "the importance of this state , even for intermediate couplings such as @xmath15 , was emphasized in the dmrg study of reference @xcite , where it was shown to be the most probable configuration of two dynamical holes in a 2-leg ladder . in the hcb model of @xcite , the states of the form of fig .",
    "2(b ) are taken into account as intermediate or virtual states , which lead to the effective hoping , @xmath11 and interaction , @xmath12 between the hole pairs .",
    "it is clear however that  integrating out \" the diagonal states through perturbation theory , erases the internal structure of the hole pairs .",
    "here we want to extend the hcb description to include the internal structure of the hole pairs .    in order to define an effective model which would retain the degrees of freedom associated with the internal structure of the hole pairs , we need to consider the states that appear in second order in the strong coupling expansion .",
    "they are given in fig .",
    "let us comment on them .",
    "the state of fig .",
    "3(a ) is of order @xmath16 and it is a higher order rvb state , whose contribution to the ground state of the undoped ladder was studied in @xcite . in this reference",
    "it was shown that its inclusion in a variational ansatz improves the numerical results , but does not change the qualitative picture obtained using the dimer ansatz @xcite .",
    "the state of fig .",
    "3(b ) , which is in fact first order in @xmath7 , can be seen as a bound state of two quasiparticles , while 3(c ) and 3(d ) are higher order corrections to the diagonal state shown in fig .",
    "for these reasons it seems consistent to keep the state 3(b ) on an equal footing with the states 2(a ) and 2(b ) . to give further support to this choice",
    ", we notice that the exact solution for two holes on the @xmath17 cluster requires a superposition of the states shown in 2(b ) and 3(b ) along with 1(a ) and 1(b ) ( see fig .",
    "4 ) @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we conjecture that in order to discuss the nature of the superconducting order parameter of the doped 2-leg , @xmath2 ladder , in the strong coupling regime , it is sufficient to consider states built up from 5 possible local configurations , given by rung - singlet - bonds ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , rung - hole - pairs ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , two - leg - bonds ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , hole - pairs with a singlet diagonal bond ( fig .  2(b ) ) and hole - pairs with a singlet leg bond ( fig .",
    "a typical state constructed using these building blocks is shown in fig .",
    "we shall call these types of states _",
    "dimer - hole - rvb _ states . the effective model that governs their dynamics will be called the _",
    "dimer hard - core boson model _",
    "( dhcb ) and its hamiltonian can be determined by considering the fluctuations of the dimer - hole states , in a manner similar to the one considered above for the hcb states .",
    "the dhcb model contains spin and charge degrees of freedom , together with their couplings , and in that sense is an interesting model to study the interplay between the two types of degrees of freedom , although here we will focus on the variational ground state of the model .",
    "the mathematical formulation of the dhcb model involves an interesting but complicated combination of vertex and interaction round a face ( irf ) models .",
    "the latter terminology is borrowed from statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the vertex variables describe the number of electrons per rung , i.e. @xmath18 , while the irf variables describe the number and type of bonds connecting two rungs , i.e. @xmath19 , where the subindices @xmath20 , @xmath21 indicate the diagonal or horizontal nature of the bond .",
    "the only allowed configurations for two consecutive irf variables @xmath22 are : @xmath23 together with their permutations .",
    "moreover the vertex variables are subject to certain constraints imposed by the irf ones .",
    "namely , a ) if @xmath24 or @xmath25 then @xmath26 and b ) if @xmath27 then @xmath28 . only if @xmath29 can @xmath30 and @xmath31 take any value , i.e. 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to present a full account of the dhcb model .",
    "instead , we shall try to uncover some of its physics , by means of a combination of two approaches , namely the density matrix renormalization group@xcite and the recurrence relation method ( rrm)@xcite . while the dmrg is a powerful numerical technique , which in many cases yields the exact answer , the rrm is essentially analytic , lacking the numerical precision of the dmrg , but sharing with it some features , as for example the wilsonian way of growing the system by the addition of sites at the boundary . in the rrm one",
    "begins with an assumption about the local configurations through which the system grows .",
    "then one may test whether the state that is generated gives results in agreement with the essentially exact dmrg results .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 2-leg , @xmath2 ladder is given by ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 or @xmath34 , depending on whether the link @xmath35 is along the legs or the rungs respectively .",
    "@xmath36 is the gutzwiller projection operator which forbids double occupancy .",
    "the rest of the operators appearing in ( [ 1 ] ) are standard ( we use the conventions of reference @xcite ) .",
    "each site @xmath37 is labelled by the coordinates @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we choose open boundary conditions along the legs of the ladder .",
    "the pair field operator which creates a pair of electrons , at the sites @xmath37 and @xmath41 , out of the vacuum is given by ,    @xmath42    as explained in the introduction , we want to built up an ansatz for the ground state based on the 5 local configurations of the dhcb model .",
    "the explicit realization of these configurations in terms of pair field operators are given by ( see fig.6 ) ,    @xmath43 \\,\\ , |0 \\rangle_{x , x+1 } \\end{array } \\label{3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the fock vacuum associated with the rung labelled by the coordinate @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the states @xmath47 , involve @xmath48 rungs and @xmath49 pairs of holes .",
    "the variational parameter @xmath50 gives the amplitude of the resonance of a pair of bonds between vertical and horizontal positions @xcite , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the variational parameters associated with the diagonal and horizontal configurations of two holes respectively . in the strong coupling limit , @xmath8",
    ", we expect to find @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "let us call @xmath55 the ground state of a ladder with @xmath56 rungs and @xmath57 pairs of holes . of course we should be in a regime of the coupling constants where there is binding of two holes .",
    "the state @xmath55 will be in general a linear superposition of the dimer - hole states of fig.5 , which suggests that working with this sort of states could be a formidable task .",
    "fortunately , we can apply the method developed in @xcite to generate @xmath55 in a recursive manner , in terms of the states of the ladders with @xmath58 and @xmath59 rungs , and @xmath57 and @xmath60 pairs of holes .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that @xmath61 , which is in fact a dimer - rvb state @xcite , can be generated by a second order recursion relation . then by a simple procedure one can compute overlaps and expectation values of different operators using recursion formulas ,",
    "whose thermodynamic limit can be studied analytically .    following the strategy of considering first the hcb states and then the dhcb ones",
    ", we shall give the rule that generates the former type of states .",
    "it is given by the first order recursion relation ,    @xmath62    supplemented with the initial conditions ,    @xmath63    calling @xmath64 the number of linearly independent states contained in @xmath65 , we deduce from eq.([4 ] ) the recursion relation ,    @xmath66    whose solution is given by the combinatorial number ,    @xmath67    eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) is the dimension of the hilbert space of the hcb model with @xmath56 sites and @xmath57 pair of holes .",
    "we have not introduced variational parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , but if we did , then all states of the hilbert space of the hcb model would be generated by the first order recursion relation .",
    "it may be worthwhile to recall that the hcb model is essentially equivalent to the spinless fermion model or the xxz model @xcite .",
    "turning now to the dhcb model , the key point is to realize that the dimer - hole states can be generated by the following second order recursion relation , involving the local configurations given by eq.([3 ] ) ,    @xmath68 ) .",
    "see fig.7 for a graphical representation of ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "* counting dimer - hole states *    let @xmath69 denote the number of dimer - hole states of a 2-leg ladder with @xmath56 rungs containing @xmath57 pairs of holes . according to ( [ 8 ] ) they satisfy the recursion relation    @xmath70    with the initial conditions    @xmath71    from ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] )",
    "we deduce that @xmath72 satisfies the well known fibonacci recursion formula @xcite , and that in the limit of very large @xmath56 it grows exponentially ,    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the golden ratio . using generating function methods@xcite",
    "one can easily solved the recursion relation ( [ 9 ] ) , together with the initial condition ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the result is given by the contour integral ,    @xmath75    where the contour encircles the singularities of the integrand .",
    "for @xmath76 the integrand has two simple poles at the zeros of the polynomial @xmath77 , the largest of which is precisely the golden ratio @xmath78 . in this way one gets eq.([11 ] ) . for a finite number of holes the residue formula applied to ( [ 12 ] ) yields , to leading order in @xmath56    @xmath79    where the proportionality constant depends only on @xmath57 .",
    "let us finally consider the limit where both @xmath56 and @xmath57 go to infinity , while keeping their ratio fixed ,    @xmath80    here @xmath45 can be identified with the hole doping factor of the state @xmath65 .",
    "the saddle point method applied to ( [ 12 ] ) gives the asymptotic behaviour of the number of dimer - hole states for a finite density of holes ,    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the highest root of the following equation    @xmath83    the function @xmath84 is depicted in fig .",
    "observe that @xmath85 .",
    "the effect of a finite density of holes is that of moving a singularity .",
    "this phenomena also occurs in the computation of the energy , and other observables .",
    "* ground state energy *    the parameters @xmath86 are found by the standard minimization of the mean value of the energy @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes the hamiltonian of the ladder with @xmath56 rungs .",
    "the usefulness of eq.([8 ] ) is that it implies that the wave function and energy overlaps also satisfy recursion relations .",
    "let us define the following quantities ,    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the number operator acting on the rung @xmath56 .",
    "the off - diagonal overlaps arise from the cross terms when applying ( [ 8 ] ) to the ket and the bras in @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the recursion relations satisfied by ( [ 17 ] ) are given by ,    @xmath93    the initial conditions read ,    @xmath94    for finite values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and given choices of @xmath86 , one can iterate numerically the recursion relation ( [ 18 ] ) using the initial conditions ( [ 19 ] ) and look for the minimum of the ground state energy @xmath95 .",
    "we give below the results obtained using this variational method for a @xmath96 ladder and compare them with the corresponding results obtained with the dmrg .",
    "as explained in the introduction the dhcb model is the appropiate framework to study the strong coupling limit of the 2-leg ladder , if one wishes to take into account the local structure of the hole pairs . to check the validity of this asumption",
    "we have studied the cases where the coupling constants takes the following values , @xmath97 and @xmath98 and 5 . in this manner",
    "we go from the intermediate coupling regime , i.e. @xmath99 to the strong coupling regime @xmath100 .",
    "we are always working in a non - phase - separated region .    in figure 9",
    "we show the ground state energy of the 2 x 32 ladder , for the previous choices of parameters , computed with the rrm for all dopings and the dmrg for @xmath101 and 7/8 .",
    "one sees that the results obtained with the rrm wave function agree reasonably well with those of the dmrg and their accuracy improves as @xmath6 increases .",
    "the kinetic energy of the ladder is shown in fig.10 .",
    "it has the pattern expected for a collective charge mode , as described by the hcb and the dhcb models .",
    "the similarity between this figure and fig.8 have a common origin .",
    "they both correspond to holes moving collectively through the spins in a complicated many body state .",
    "fig.10 shows the existence of an optimal doping for which the kinetic energy is a minimum .",
    "the existence and position of this optimal doping depends on the values of the coupling constants .",
    "the nature of this many body state is clarified by figures 11 , 12 and 13 where we show the values of the variational parameters @xmath102 and @xmath52 as functions of the doping @xmath45 for different coupling constants .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 starts from a positive value corresponding to the undoped ladder @xcite , and it decreases upon doping until a critical value @xmath103 , where it vanishes . for higher",
    "dopings @xmath50 becomes negative .",
    "for the undoped ladder the parameter @xmath50 can be interpreted as the square of the rvb amplitude @xmath104 for having a bond along the legs@xcite .",
    "the analogue amplitude for a bond along the rungs has been implicitly normalized to 1 . for low doping ,",
    "i.e. @xmath105 , since @xmath106 , we can similarly define a doping dependent amplitude for a leg - bond as    @xmath107    in order to fulfill the marshall theorem for the undoped ladder one requires the rvb amplitude @xmath108 to be positive @xcite , which explains why @xmath109 is also positive .",
    "actually for the positivity of @xmath109 one just need @xmath108 to be a real number . at @xmath110 @xmath108 increases with @xmath13 due to the resonance between rung and leg singlets , according to the rvb scenario . upon doping , however , the holes give rise to destructive interference which degrades progressively the aforementioned resonance mechanism .",
    "this explains why @xmath111 and @xmath112 decrease with @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath105 the ground state is dominated by the resonating valence bonds and the rvb picture remains qualitatively correct .",
    "for @xmath113 the interference due to the holes has driven @xmath50 negative and it is no longer appropiate to interpret @xmath111 as the square of @xmath114 .",
    "rather , the physical interpretation of the overdoped region comes from the solution of the cooper problem in the @xmath2 , 2-leg ladder , and its bcs extension .",
    "it can be shown analytically that two electrons in the latter system form a bound state only under certain conditions ( details will be given elsewhere ) . for @xmath115",
    "one must have @xmath116 , ( note that the binding of two electrons in the @xmath2 chain requires @xmath117 @xcite ) .",
    "the exact solution for 4 or more electrons is difficult to construct , but we expect it to be given essentially by a gutzwiller projected bcs like wave function . a short range version of the latter type of wave function can be generated from the recursion relation ( [ 8 ] ) , with @xmath50 a negative parameter , which can be written as    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the bcs amplitude for finding two electrons at distance 1 along the legs .",
    "of course this interpretation of @xmath50 as minus the square of a bcs amplitude requires it to be negative . as we put more electrons into the ladder the value of @xmath119 decreases and for electron densities larger than @xmath120 , we switch into the rvb regime .",
    "the difference between the underdoped and overdoped regimens can be attributed to two different internal structures of the pairs . in the low doping regime @xmath121 , holes doped into the spin - liquid rvb state form pairs with an internal @xmath4-like structure relative to the undoped system .",
    "however for @xmath113 one moves into the low density limit characterized by electrons doped into an internal @xmath122-wave like symmetry .",
    "this issue will be discussed in detail in a separate publication .",
    "let us now comment on figs .",
    "12 and 13 .",
    "both are very similar and show that for @xmath123 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 reach their maximum . at",
    "@xmath124 there are as many electrons as holes , and in a certain sense the ground state of the ladder is a large scale reproduction of the microscopic ground state of the 2 x 2 cluster given in fig .",
    "4 . indeed for",
    "@xmath125 the ratio @xmath126 of the parameters appearing in fig .",
    "4 is given by 1.30 , which is very close to the value of @xmath51 at its maximum .",
    "for @xmath127 and @xmath128 the parameter @xmath51 is larger than 1 and it is always larger than @xmath52 for all dopings and couplings .",
    "this is in agreement with the dmrg results of @xcite , which show the importance of the diagonal frustrating bonds above the horizontal or vertical ones for @xmath129 .",
    "finally fig.14 is a @xmath130 diagram which shows the boundary of phase separation obtained by means of the dmrg and the rrm in the case where @xmath131 .",
    "observe that this is not the strong coupling case we have been discussing so far , and hence the validity of the rrm is more questionable . in any case",
    ", we see an overall agreement between both results ( see references @xcite for comparisons with other numerical results ) . in the two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 model ,",
    "phase separation is controlled by @xmath1 , rather than @xmath6 , so the strongest coupling we have considered above , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , does not phase separate .",
    "in this paper we have proposed an extension of the effective hard - core boson model ( hcb ) of the 2-leg ladder of reference @xcite , in order to include the local structure of the hole pairs . the extended effective model , called the dhcb model , contains both dimer bonds , hard core bosons and various combinations between bonds and holes , whose relevance have been studied previously with dmrg @xcite .",
    "generalizing the methods of reference @xcite to the case with holes , we study a variational ansatz for the ground state of the dhcb model , which depends only on three variational parameters",
    ". the resulting dimer - hole state is generated by a second order recursion formula , which also leads to recursion formulas for the overlaps necessary to compute the energy of the ansatz .",
    "we give the results of the energy minimization for the 2 x 32 ladder and compare them with those obtained with the dmrg method in the strong coupling region .",
    "the recursion relations we have derived for the ground state energy can be solved analytically in the thermodynamic limit and the minimization can be then done numerically .",
    "finally we give a physical interpretation of the behaviour of the variational parameters with doping .",
