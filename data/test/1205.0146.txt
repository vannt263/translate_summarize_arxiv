    "one of the fascinating solutions of the gravity theories is the black hole space time .",
    "pioneering works of bekenstain @xcite , hawking @xcite and later on bardeen et al @xcite illuminated the fact that all the laws of black hole mechanics are identical to those of the ordinary thermodynamics with properly identification of the respective quantities , like temperature , entropy , energy etc . and hence they do act as the ordinary thermal system .",
    "people then started thinking that black holes may play a crucial role to give idea on the quantum nature of the gravity .",
    "but till now there is no such complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "several recent results strongly indicate the possibility that the field equations of gravity have the same status as the equations of fluid mechanics or elasticity . for a recent review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one specific implementation of this idea considers the field equations of the theory to be ` emergent ' in a well - defined sense , rather than use that term in a more speculative vein like e.g. , considering the space and time themselves to be emergent etc .",
    "the evidence for such a specific interpretation comes from different facts like the possibility of interpreting the field equation in a wide class of theories as thermodynamic relations @xcite , the nature of action functional in gravitational theories and their thermodynamic interpretation @xcite , the possibility of obtaining the field equations from a thermodynamic extremum principle @xcite , application of equipartition ideas to obtain the density of microscopic degrees of freedom @xcite , the equivalence of einstein s field equations to the navier - stokes equations near a null surface @xcite etc .",
    "the important fact in the emergent paradigm is that one does not need to know about the details of the microscopic description of the theory .",
    "these lead to the idea that one can study the different aspects of thermodynamics , in the case of gravity , without any detail of the underlying microscopic structure . here",
    "we will adopt the same logic and study the phase transition of the black hole solution in hoava - lifshitz theory following the prescription in ordinary thermodynamics .",
    "studying the thermodynamics @xcite-@xcite as well as the critical behavior @xcite-@xcite of various black hole solutions in the framework of usual einstein gravity has been a fascinating topic of research for the past few decades .",
    "apart from these , there also exist topological black hole solutions whose thermodynamics has been studied in einstein gravity @xcite , einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity and dilaton gravity @xcite as well as lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , inspired by the dynamical critical phenomena in usual condensed matter systems , very recently p. hoava proposed a uv complete theory of gravity @xcite that reduces to the usual einstein gravity at large scales .",
    "since then a number of attempts have been made in order to understand various aspects of this theory @xcite-@xcite including different cosmological aspects @xcite .",
    "various black hole solutions were also found in @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of these black holes have been studied in @xcite .",
    "although these attempts are self contained and rigorous , still there remains some major questions which have not yet been attempted .",
    "studying the critical behavior of black holes is one of the important aspects , which we aim to explore for hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity .    in ordinary thermodynamics ,",
    "critical exponents plays a crucial role in order to understand the singular behavior of various thermodynamic entities near the critical point . in usual thermodynamic systems , it is customary to express the singular behavior of various thermodynamic systems in terms of power laws characterized by a set of _ static critical exponents _ which determines the qualitative nature of the phase transition near the critical point .",
    "all these exponents are not independent and are found to satisfy certain _",
    "thermodynamic scaling laws _ near the critical point @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is generally observed that for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the spatial dimension of the system , the critical exponents do not depend on the spatial dimension of the system , which reflects the mean field characteristics of a theory . on the other hand",
    "if the interaction between the constituent elements are short range then the critical exponents are found to be depe ndent on @xmath6 .    in this paper ,",
    "based on a canonical framework ( i.e ; keeping the charge ( @xmath7 ) of the black hole fixed @xcite ) , we investigate the critical behavior of topological charged black holes in hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity at the lifshitz point @xmath1 .",
    "the black hole solution is given in @xcite .",
    "although all the thermodynamic quantities were evaluated earlier @xcite , a detailed study of the nature of phase transition is still lacking . particularly the issue regarding the _ scaling behavior _ of ( charged ) black holes has never been investigated so far in the frame work of hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity .",
    "we investigate the phase transition phenomena for all the three cases taking @xmath8 .",
    "we observe the following interesting features : @xmath9 there is no hawking page transition @xcite for black hole with @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 for @xmath4 , there is a upper bound in the value of the event horizon , above which the temperature becomes negative .",
    "this indicates that above this critical value of horizon , the black hole solution does not exist .",
    "we will call this valid range as the _",
    "physical region_. @xmath9 within the physical region , interesting phase structure could be observed for the hyperbolic charged black holes ( @xmath11 ) . in this particular case",
    "we observe the second order transition .",
    "this is _ different _ from the usual one . in einstein gravity , hawking page transition occurs for @xmath3 while there is no such transition for @xmath12 .",
    "the critical point of second order phase transition is marked by the divergence in the heat capacity at constant charge ( @xmath13 ) . finally , we explicitly calculate all the _ static critical exponents _ associated with the second order transition , and check the validity of _ thermodynamic scaling laws _ near the critical point .",
    "interestingly enough it is found that the hyperbolic charged black holes ( @xmath14 ) in the hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity fall under the same universality class to that with the black holes having spherically symmetric topology ( @xmath15 ) in the usual einstein gravity .",
    "the values of these critical exponents indeed suggest a universal _ mean field _",
    "behavior in black holes which valid in both the einstein as well as hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we begin in section 2 by giving a brief introduction of the black hole solution in hoava - lifshitz gravity and use it in section 3 to study the different thermodynamic quantities as well as the phase transition . in section 4 , the critical exponents near the critical point are being evaluated and a brief discussion on the validity of the ordinary scaling laws is presented . finally , we conclude in section 5 .",
    "in this section a brief discussion on the black hole solution in hoava - lifshitz gravity will be presented . for details",
    ", one can follow @xcite where the meaning of all the parameters are given explicitly .",
    "we will mainly concentrate on the solutions at the lifshitz point @xmath1 , particularly , the static spherically symmetric topological charged black holes solution @xmath16 where , @xmath17 is the line element for a two dimensional einstein space with constant scalar curvature @xmath0 . without loss of generality ,",
    "one can take @xmath18 respectively . the form of the metric coefficient , for the detailed balance condition , is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponds to the negative cosmological constant .",
    "the physical mass and the charge ( @xmath7 ) corresponding to the black hole solution are respectively given by , @xmath22 where , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the integration constants , @xmath25 is the volume of the two dimensional einstein space and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the constant parameters of the theory .",
    "the event horizon is the solution of the equation @xmath28 .",
    "in ordinary thermodynamics the phase transition is studied by the divergence of relevant thermodynamic quantities . here , the same technique will be adopted .",
    "we shall first calculate the hawking temperature , entropy and specific heat of the black hole using a canonical ensemble frame work , which means that we shall carry out our analysis keeping the total charge ( @xmath7 ) of the black hole fixed @xcite .",
    "finally , a graphical analysis will be given to study the phase transition .",
    "before we proceed further , let us mention that in the following analysis we re - scale our variables as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where we have set @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the hawking temperature is calculated as @xmath34 and after the above mentioned re - scaling the entropy is found to be @xmath35 in the above , @xmath36 is the integration constant which must be fixed by the physical consideration . to be precise , entropy",
    "is always determined upto some additive constant .",
    "but in all physical considerations the difference is important .",
    "therefore in the present analysis we will consider only the difference .",
    "however , the integration constant @xmath36 could be determined using the usual thermodynamic prescription ; i.e. determination of entropy in the @xmath37 limit , which might be the entropy of an extremal black hole .    )",

    "first of all , for the case @xmath44 , we note that the hawking temperature ( @xmath42 ) is a monotonically increasing function of horizon radius ( @xmath45 ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) which indicates that the corresponding heat capacities ( @xmath13 ) are always positive definite . therefore these black holes are globally stable and there is no phase transition .",
    "next consider the other case , @xmath11 .",
    "for this , the hawking temperature ( [ t ] ) reduces to the following form : @xmath46 it it interesting to note that the hawking temperature ( @xmath42 ) is always positive in the range @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , if we plot the entropy ( @xmath48 ) as a function of @xmath49 , using ( [ s ] ) , it shows that @xmath48 is also positive in this range ( see fig .",
    "interestingly enough this condition is found to be valid for any value of the physical charge ( @xmath7 ) of the black hole . on the other hand",
    ", we note that @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "this is due to the fact that as @xmath51 the second term on the r.h.s of ( [ tk ] ) dominates over the first one which ultimately produces a large negative temperature .",
    "this is a nonphysical situation and the corresponding black hole solution does not exist for @xmath52 .",
    "considering this fact , in the present paper we carry out our analysis in the _ physical range _",
    "@xmath47 where the temperature ( @xmath42 ) of the black hole is _ finite _ as well as _",
    "positive _ definite .    in the above specified range ( @xmath47 )",
    "we observe a change in slope at @xmath53 of the corresponding ( @xmath54 ) plot ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . this change in slope signals a discontinuity at @xmath53 in the corresponding heat capacity @xmath13 .",
    "it gives a indication of second order phase transition at @xmath53 , which we shall refer as the critical point of phase transition . in order to make the discussion more transparent",
    "we next compute the corresponding heat capacity ( @xmath13 ) .    using ( [ t ] ) and ( [ s ] ) the heat capacity",
    "is determined as @xmath55    ) plot of topological black holes for @xmath11 with respect to @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40._,width=302 ]    from the above figure ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we see that specific heat ( @xmath13 ) indeed suffers a discontinuity at @xmath56 .",
    "this shows that there is a genuine second order phase transition at @xmath56 . for the phase 1 the heat capacity ( @xmath13 ) is always found to be positive ( see fig .",
    "3 ) which means that this phase is thermodynamically _ stable_. on the other hand , @xmath57 for the phase 2 and therefore it is an _",
    "unstable phase_.    this scenario is completely different in the einstein gravity , where we have no hawking page transition for @xmath58 . whereas , @xmath3 case exhibits hawking page transition @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for the above phase structure one can further investigate the critical behavior of the black hole in hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity near the critical point @xmath59 , which we aim to discuss in the next section .",
    "in this section , based on a thermodynamic approach , we explicitly calculate various critical exponents ( that is associated with the second order phase transition at @xmath59 ) for the hyperbolic charged black holes ( with @xmath11 ) in the fixed charge ( @xmath7 ) ensemble .    in the theory of phase transitions ,",
    "critical exponents play an important role in order to understand the singular behavior of various thermodynamic entities near the critical point(s ) . in order to have a complete understanding of the physics of phase transition phenomena ,",
    "one generally introduces a set of static critical exponents @xmath60 which play a central role in the theory of critical phenomena , and studies the so called thermodynamic scaling laws @xcite near the critical point .    in order to find the critical exponents , we write near the critical point @xmath61 where @xmath62 . defining @xmath63 , the taylor expansion of the temperature ( @xmath42 ) about @xmath53 yields @xmath64_{x_+=x_2}(x_+-x_2)+\\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}t}{\\partial x_+^{2 } } \\right)_{q}\\big]_{x_+=x_2}(x_+-x_2)^{2}+",

    "therefore ( [ cq ] ) implies that the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eq2 ] ) vanishes . hence neglecting the higher order terms and then using ( [ eq1 ] ) in ( [ eq2 ] ) we obtain ,",
    "@xmath66 where , @xmath67 _ { x_+=x_2}=\\frac{6x_2^{2}+3q^{2}x_2^{2}-6x_2^{4}-6q^{2}x_2^{4}-2-q^{2}}{x_2^{3}(x_{2}^{2}-1)^{3}}.\\ ] ]    now to find the critical exponent @xmath68 which is defined by the standard relation @xmath69 we use the relation ( [ eq1 ] ) in ( [ cq ] ) and then keep the terms only linear in @xmath70 to obtain @xmath71 with @xmath72 finally , using ( [ eq3 ] ) in the above we find the behavior of @xmath13 near the critical point @xmath53 : @xmath73 where , @xmath74 a comparison of ( [ eq4 ] ) with the standard relation ( [ alpha ] ) yields @xmath75 .",
    "next the determination of the critical exponent @xmath76 which is defined through the relation ( for a fixed value of charge @xmath7 ) as , @xmath77 will be done . here",
    "the potential @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 to proceed , let us first taylor expand @xmath80 about @xmath81 : @xmath82_{x_+=x_2 } ( x_+-x_2)+{\\textrm{higher order terms } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\phi(x_2 )   - \\frac{q}{x_2 ^ 2 } ( x_+-x_2)+{\\textrm{higher order terms}}~. \\label{phi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as before , neglecting the higher order terms and then using ( [ eq1 ] ) we obtain , @xmath83 where in the final step ( [ eq3 ] ) also has been used .",

    "this yields , @xmath94 comparing with the standard relation @xmath95 , defined for the fixed value of charge ( @xmath7 ) , we get @xmath96 .    the critical exponent @xmath97 is defined through the relation , @xmath98 at constant temperature @xmath42 . to find it , we first expand @xmath99 in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath100 which yields , @xmath101_{x_+=x_2 } ( x_+-x_2)+\\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\partial^{2 } q}{\\partial x^{2}_+}\\right)_{t}\\right]_{x_+=x_2 } ( x_+-x_2)^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { \\textrm{higher order terms}}~. \\label{q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath102 ( see eq .",

    "therefore , after neglecting the higher order terms , ( [ q ] ) reduces to @xmath106 where , @xmath107_{x_+=x_2}=\\frac{18x_2^{8}+32x_2^{4}-44x_2^{6}-3q^{2}x_2^{4}-4x_2^{2}-2-q^{2}}{2q^{2}x_2^{2}(x_2^{2}-1)^{2}}.\\ ] ] next since @xmath108 , we have the functional relation @xmath109 and so @xmath110 therefore using ( [ eq7 ] ) we find , @xmath111_{x_+=x_2 } = \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x_+}\\right)_{q } \\right]_{x_+=x_2}=-\\frac{q}{x_2^{2}}.\\label{eq9}\\ ] ] finally , expanding @xmath112 close to the critical point @xmath113 at constant @xmath103 and then using ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) we obtain , @xmath114^{1/2}~. \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] hence , the critical exponent is read off as @xmath115 .",

    ", we give the values of the critical exponents for the present example :    .various critical exponents and their values [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ e1 ]    it may be interesting to mention that the critical exponents for the second order phase transition in the case of hyperbolic black hole in hoava - lifshitz gravity are exactly equal to those obtained earlier in @xcite for the einstein - born - infeld gravity with @xmath3 .    in the last part of the section , we discuss about the validity of the usual thermodynamic scaling laws for our present situation .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the realistic thermodynamic systems various critical exponents are found to satisfy certain ( scaling ) relations among themselves , known as _",
    "thermodynamic scaling laws _",
    "@xcite-@xcite , which may be expressed as , @xmath127 since the critical exponents , we find here , are exactly equal to those obtained in the usual einstein - born - infeld gravity for @xmath128 @xcite , all the above relations ( [ scaling laws ] ) are indeed satisfied for the present case , in spite of difference in the nature of the black hole solution and the phase structure .",
    "this can be checked easily by substituting the values from the table in ( [ scaling laws ] ) . in this sense , it may be possible that the black holes in both type of theories fall under the same class such that their critical exponents are identical .",
    "finally we are in a position to check the additional scaling laws for the exponents @xmath129 and @xmath130 which are associated with the diverging nature of correlation length and correlation function near the critical point .",
    "since the spatial dimension ( @xmath6 ) of our theory is @xmath131 , therefore it will be natural to assume that the additional scaling relations , @xmath132 will hold in general .",
    "this immediately determines the other exponents .",
    "taking @xmath133 and using the exponent values from table 1 , we finally obtain , @xmath134 in practical situation , the assumption that the scaling laws ( [ add ] ) are valid , may not be true .",
    "hence it must be checked that these are indeed valid or not .",
    "alternatively , one should find the above exponents by some alternative method .",
    "it is now evident that gravity and thermodynamics are closely connected to each other @xcite .",
    "the repeated failure to quantize gravity led to a parallel development where gravity is believed to be an emergent phenomenon just like thermodynamics and hydrodynamics instead treating it as a fundamental force @xcite .",
    "the fundamental role of gravity is replaced by thermodynamic interpretations leading to similar or equivalent results without knowing the underlying microscopic details .    in this paper , we adopted the standard thermodynamic approach to explore the phase structure of the topological charged black holes in hoava - lifshitz gravity for the lifshitz point @xmath1 . these black holes were introduced earlier in @xcite . in @xcite the authors have computed the general expression for the hawking temperature for these black holes . in spite of this attempt , till date the issue regarding the nature of phase transition , particularly the issue of critical phenomena , remains completely unexplored . in the present paper",
    ", we attempted to provide an answer to all these questions .",
    "a number of interesting features have been observed in this regard which have never been explored so far to the best of our knowledge .",
    "these are as follows : @xmath9 we showed that there exits a _ physical range _",
    "@xmath135 , where the black hole solution exists .",
    "@xmath9 within this range , the second order phase transition occurs .",
    "@xmath9 the situation is not exactly identical to einstein theory . in einstein theory , there is no hawking page phase transition for @xmath12 while @xmath3 case exhibits such phase transition . here , only @xmath4 solution has phase transition .",
    "@xmath9 finally , the critical exponents near the critical point of the phase transition were derived .",
    "this was done again using the ordinary thermodynamic analogy .",
    "it may be noted that the critical point has been marked by the discontinuity of the heat capacity ( @xmath136 ) which suggests that it is a second order phase transition . moreover , as a point of conformation , we also found that the critical exponent , associated with the divergence in @xmath65 , is @xmath137 which simultaneously indicates a mean field feature as well as a second order nature of the phase transition .",
    "interestingly , these are exactly equal to those of einstein - born - infeld theory @xcite-@xcite and also they satisfy the ordinary thermodynamic scaling laws .",
    "this in fact suggests two remarkable facts : ( 1 ) black holes in both the einstein as well as hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity fall under the same universality class , ( 2 ) there exists a universal _ mean field _ behavior in both of these gravi ty theories .",
    "it may be pointed out that the issues , dealt with the present paper , are notoriously difficult to study .",
    "so far what we have done is completely based on the ordinary thermodynamic analogy . but a simple analogy with the thermodynamics may not be enough to draw safe conclusions .",
    "also the understanding of the thermodynamic interpretation of gravity is far from complete since the arguments are more heuristic than concrete and depend upon specific ansatz or assumptions",
    ". therefore the results are suggestive rather than definitive .",
    "hence it is necessary to compute the critical exponents by other alternative / direct procedures ; e.g. correlation function technique of the scalar modes , the ads / cft correspondence , re - normalization group scheme , etc . which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in spite of this , we still believe that the analysis , presented here , could illuminate the underlying microscopic structure of the gravity .",
