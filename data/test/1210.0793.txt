    "the detection of hydrogen- and volatile - rich exoplanets at orbital distances @xmath01 au opens questions regarding their upper atmosphere structures and the stability against escape of atmospheric gases . since @xmath140% of all discovered exoplanets are orbiting their host stars at distances closer than the orbit of mercury , the atmospheres of these bodies evolve in much more extreme environments than what is known from the planets in our solar system .",

    "under such conditions the exobase can move to locations which are above a possible magnetopause or even at the roche lobe distance ( e.g. , lammer et al .",

    "the first observational evidence of an xuv - heated extended non - hydrostatic upper atmosphere was obtained for the hot gas giant hd 209458b , which orbits a sun - like star at 0.047 au ( vidal - madjar et al .",

    "excess absorption in the lyman-@xmath4 line of @xmath5915 % during the transit was interpreted as being caused by a population of atomic hydrogen located beyond the roche lobe , indicating a hot and extended upper atmosphere .",

    "( 2010 ) . as heavier elements can only be dragged to the upper atmosphere regions along with upward flowing hydrogen atoms , these observations of heavy elements at large distances from the planet most likely confirm scenarios which were suggested by sekiya , nakazawa , & hayashi ( 1980 ) , sekiya , hayashi , & nakazawa ( 1981 ) , hunten , pepin , & walker ( 1987 ) and pepin ( 1991 ; 2000 ) that hydrodynamic escape from early solar system planets like venus could have generated ne and ar isotope ratios close to the observed values in its present - time atmosphere and noble gas ratios similar to those derived for earth s initial atmosphere . in view of atmospheric isotope studies",
    "it is generally accepted that hydrodynamic outflow driven by the xuv - active young sun could have been responsible for the observed heavy isotope enrichment in the atmospheres of venus , earth and mars ( e.g. , lammer et al .",

    "although , there may be this possibility of an alternative more exotic explanation for 55 cnc e , the discoveries of these low - density hydrogen and/or h@xmath7o - rich planets can be seen as an indication that many `` super - earths '' even located close to their host stars will not lose their initial volatile - rich protoatmospheres during their lifetimes ( ikoma & hori 2012 ; lammer 2012 ) .",
    "if so , the consequences of these findings are very relevant for the probability and evolution of earth - type class i habitats ( lammer et al . 2009b ; lammer 2012 ) and habitability in general ( pierrehumbert & gaidos 2011 ; wordsworth 2012 ) .",
    "understanding the efficiency of atmospheric loss processes at hydrogen - rich `` super - earths '' is therefore crucial .",
    "the aim of this study is to investigate the environmental conditions under which `` super - earths '' with hydrogen - rich upper atmospheres undergo hydrodynamic blow - off . for this study",
    "we focus only on `` super - earths '' for which the sizes and masses are more or less well determined . for that reason we do not include transiting `` super - earths '' such as hd 97658b , kepler-9d , or small terrestrial planets such as those discovered in the kepler-42 system with unknown or uncertain masses , or `` super - earths '' with known masses but unknown radii .    in sect .",

    "in the controversial case regarding the composition of 55 cnc e , we assume in this study that the planet is surrounded by a hydrogen envelope , which would be the case if rocky core of the planet is surrounded by a h / he , or h@xmath7o dominated atmosphere as suggested by demory et al .",

    "3 we apply our hydrodynamic model to these low - density `` super - earths '' and study the response of their upper atmospheres to the stellar xuv flux and calculate the thermal atmospheric escape rates .",
    "we compare our results to the widely used energy - limited blow - off formula and discuss the relevance of our findings for `` super - earths '' in general .",
    "unfortunately , the xuv fluxes of the host stars of the studied `` super - earths '' are not very well constrained . the xuv emission of kepler-11 , a slightly evolved late - g star ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ) , is observationally unconstrained , because its large distance ( @xmath8pc ) and high age ( 610gyr ) prevent detection by current instruments .",
    "hence , we estimate its xuv flux via its age by using power laws from ribas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , although we caution that application of these calibrations for stellar ages higher than about 6.7gyr ( the highest age in their sample ) might introduce additional uncertainties because of the extrapolation to an even older , slightly evolved g star . adopting a mean age of 8gyr , this approach yields a @xmath9 , which corresponds to fluxes of @xmath10 at the respective orbits of the kepler-11 planets b - f .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties of these values to be at least an order of magnitude due to the extrapolation of the calibrations and the just loosely constrained stellar age .",
    "although gj  1214 is located at a closer distance ( @xmath513pc ) , the star has not been detected in x - rays up to now .",
    "this is probably due to the intrinsic faintness of this m4.5v star and its age of 310gyr ( charbonneau et al .",
    "therefore , we use the relation between x - ray luminosity and age of engle & guinan ( 2011 ) calibrated for m dwarfs .",
    "this relation yields an x - ray luminosity of @xmath11 for an adopted age of 6gyr . to correct for the unknown euv emission , we assume that the contributions to the total xuv flux of both x - rays and euv are @xmath550% each , typical for moderately active stars ( e.g. sanz - forcada et al .",
    "2011 ) , but euv can make up to 90% of the emission for inactive stars .",
    "this leads to an estimated xuv flux at gj  1214b s orbit of @xmath12 . as for kepler-11",
    ", the uncertainty of this value also corresponds at least an order of magnitude because of the large range of possible stellar ages , the intrinsic spread of about one order of magnitude of coeval stars of the same mass , and the very crude correction applied for the unknown euv emission .    for 55 cnc , a nearby ( @xmath512.5pc ) g9iv star ( von braun et al .",
    "2011 ) , x - ray emission was detected by esa s xmm - newton space observatory ( sanz - forcada et al .",
    "these authors used x - ray spectra of numerous planetary host stars to extrapolate their euv emission by using calibrations of stars with well - determined emission measure distributions ( emd ) .",
    "they estimated a total xuv luminosity within the wavelength region 5920  of @xmath13 , which translates to an xuv flux of @xmath14 at the orbit of 55  cnc  e. the uncertainty is @xmath15 , mainly due to the uncertainties in the extrapolated transition region emd . although x - rays might contribute somewhat to the heating of the lower thermosphere , from our analysis of the available data we assume that for the particular atmospheric escape of the investigated planets is mainly driven by the stellar euv emission .",
    "this assumption is supported by the fact that for rather old stars like the ones studied here , however , the major portion of the xuv flux ( 8090% ) is emitted in the euv range .",
    "the properties of the studied planets are summarized in table 1 , which also gives the xuv enhancement factors @xmath16 , corresponding to the ratio of the adopted xuv fluxes at the planet s orbits normalized to the present xuv flux of the sun at 1au ( @xmath17 ; ribas et al .",
    "2005 ) .      the energy budget of upper planetary atmospheres is mainly governed by the heating of the bulk atmosphere due to the absorption of the xuv radiation ( e.g. bauer & lammer 2004 ) and in very close orbital distances also harder x - rays ( cecchi - pestellini et al .",
    "2009 ; owen & jackson 2012 ) by atmospheric constituents , by heat transport due to conduction and convection and by heat loss due to emissions in the infrared ( ir ) . because the xuv fluxes are based only rough estimates",
    "except for 55 cnc e , and the atmospheric composition of the studied planets is not very well constraint , we do not consider a wavelength dependent derivation of the heating function .",
    "but we note that for future studies of exoplanets with known xuv spectra and atmospheric composition it might be important to investigate the influence of wavelength dependent absorption cross sections and their impact on the upper atmosphere structure .",
    "the volume heat production rate @xmath18 due to the absorption of the stellar radiation for given wavelengths and constituents can then be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy flux related to the corresponding wavelength range outside the atmosphere , @xmath21 is the appropriate hydrogen absorption cross - section which lies typically within the range of @xmath5 @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 ) and @xmath25 is the optical depth in the upper atmosphere and @xmath26 the number density .",
    "@xmath27 is the so - called heating efficiency or fraction of absorbed stellar radiation which is transformed into thermal energy and lies within in the range of @xmath51560 % ( chassefire 1996a ; 1996b ; yelle 2004 ; lammer et al . 2009 ;",
    "leitzinger et al .",
    "2011 ; koskinen et al .",

    "the value of @xmath27 is also related to the availability of ir - cooling molecules such as co@xmath7 , h@xmath28 , etc . and",
    "will then be closer to the lower value because less energy can be transferred into heat due to cooling by ir - emitting molecules .",
    "in a recent study by koskinen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who applied a thermosphere model that calculates the heating rate based on the absorption of stellar xuv radiation and photoelectron heating efficiencies and photochemistry to the hydrogen - rich gas giant hd 209458b , it was found that @xmath27 is most likely in the order of @xmath54060 % . for hydrogen - rich exoplanets which are exposed to xuv fluxes @xmath1100 times higher compared to that of the present sun most molecules in the thermosphere",
    "are dissociated so that ir - cooling becomes less important yielding @xmath294060 % . as this is the case for hd 208459b ,",
    "ir - cooling by h@xmath28 molecules can be neglected ( koskinen et al .",
    "however , for the kepler-11 `` super - earths '' which are exposed to xuv fluxes @xmath5860 times higher than today s sun , depending on the availability of potential ir - cooling molecules , @xmath27 may be closer to the lower value of 15% .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "2 , it is also necessary to check if escape by x - ray heating could be relevant for the studied `` super - earths ''",
    ". however , as x - ray heating usually dominates at young stellar ages ( owen & jackson 2012 ) , it is unlikely to be of relevance here because of the rather high ages of the host stars . if we compare the x - ray luminosities of the host stars with the values necessary for having dominating x - ray escape ( owen & jackson 2012 ; their fig .",
    "11 ) , one can estimate that x - ray luminosities of at least @xmath30 or @xmath31 would be necessary for the close - in gj 1214b and 55 cnc e `` super - earths '' and the further separated kepler-11b - f planets , respectively , if we adopt the values for a neptune - mass planet with a density of @xmath32 as a lower limit .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of all studied `` super - earth '' host stars are all well below these values ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that x - ray induced evaporation can be neglected or may play a minor role for the studied `` super - earths '' , and xuv radiation should be responsible for the main heating processes in their hydrogen - rich thermospheres .    by averaging the xuv volume heating rate over the planet s dayside one obtains @xmath34 with the polar angle @xmath35 and @xmath36 . because the thermal escape rate is determined by the total energy deposited in the upper atmosphere , which is given by the integral of the xuv volume heating rate over the radial distance within the simulation domain",
    ", the shape of @xmath18 has a minor effect to the atmospheric loss rate . besides the uncertainties in the availability of possible thermospheric ir - coolers , other parametrical uncertainties such as the chosen xuv flux , a possible x - ray heating contribution , the stellar age , etc .",
    "are most likely within the investigated limits of the assumed 1540 % @xmath27 range .",
    "for studying the response of the hydrogen - dominated upper atmospheres of our `` super - earths '' to the stellar xuv flux we apply a non - stationary 1d hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model which is a further developed model based on penz et al .",

    "this geometrical blow - off is most extreme for 55 cnc e and is also effective for gj 1214b for which the distances of the respective l1 points @xmath55 are about @xmath56 . due to the low gravities , the enormous expansions of the upper atmospheres and the relatively close distances to their host stars",

    "<S> the discovery of transiting `` super - earths '' with inflated radii and known masses such as kepler-11b - f , gj 1214b and 55 cnc e , indicates that these exoplanets did not lose their nebula - captured hydrogen - rich , degassed or impact - delivered protoatmospheres by atmospheric escape processes . because hydrodynamic blow - off of atmospheric hydrogen atoms is the most efficient atmospheric escape process we apply a time - dependent numerical algorithm which is able to solve the system of 1-d fluid equations for mass , momentum , and energy conservation to investigate the criteria under which `` super - earths '' with hydrogen - dominated upper atmospheres can experience hydrodynamic expansion by heating of the stellar xuv ( soft x - rays and extreme ultraviolet ) radiation and thermal escape via blow - off . depending on orbit location , xuv flux , heating efficiency and the planet s mean density our results indicate that the upper atmospheres of all `` super - earths '' can expand to large distances , so that besides of kepler-11c all of them experience atmospheric mass - loss due to roche lobe overflow . </S>",
