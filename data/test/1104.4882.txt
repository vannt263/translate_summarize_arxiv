    "n1 and rs1 are not spatially separated . also , rs1 was not detected at 2.2 ghz at epoch 2 possibly because of the lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the source rs2 is located northeast of the southern nucleus in our 1.6 ghz evn map of figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "it appears that the peak position of rs2 at 1.6 and 5.0 ghz lies close to the compact component s1 at 0@xmath7.3 northeast from n1 in the 1.7 and 2.4 ghz vlba observations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", rs2 has an offset of @xmath30 10@xmath415  mas at 1.6 ghz or 5.0 ghz relative to s1 at 1.7 ghz or 2.4 ghz , which is not within the estimated positional errors ( table  [ tbl3 ] ) .",

    "the structure of the northeastern nucleus n2 at 5.0 ghz ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) shows a northwest extension of @xmath30 0.02 ( @xmath30 9.5 pc ) that is consistent with the earlier vlba maps at 1.7 and 2.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "although this structure at lower contours may not be reliable because of incomplete phase and amplitude calibration , an east - west structure may be explained as a core - jet structure typically seen in high - luminosity seyfert nuclei .",
    "the northern nucleus itself remains unresolved at both 1.6 and 2.2 ghz . only at the highest frequency of 8.4 ghz",
    ", n2 has an east - west elongation that is consistent with the earlier vlba data ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "our evn data present the detection of the double nuclei at higher frequencies of 5.0 and 8.4 ghz , where earlier vlba data failed to detect these nuclei .",
    "these results combined with earlier vlba studies , allow study of the nature of the nuclei at milliarcsecond - scale structure . while our study focuses on the physics of the two nuclei , the detection of two new components is a key to understanding the activity of ngc 6240 .",
    "the northern nucleus n2 shows an inverted spectrum rather than a steep spectrum that would be more typical for a radio jet ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the structure of n2 at 5.0 ghz is partially resolved and shows an east - west extension at its lower contours that still remains questionable because of the insufficient amplitude calibration ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "changes in source structure may also result from a different ( u , v ) coverage for the two epochs .",
    "the detection of the x - ray emission towards n2 @xcite is less convincing than the definite detection towards n1 .",
    "nevertheless , the radio morphology of n2 resembles that of a core - jet structure seen in seyfert nuclei , such as @xcite , but this requires further verification .",
    "by contrast with , the vla observations of the h@xmath9o@xmath10maser in ngc 6240 have not detected any emission towards n2 during seven years @xcite .",
    "the southern nucleus n1 appears partially resolved in an east - west direction ( figure  [ fig2]b,2c ) but its flux density at 5.0 ghz has not changed significantly during 6 years .",
    "contrary to the spectrum of n2 ( see discussion below ) , the spectrum of n1 with missing epoch 2 detections at 2.2 and 8.4 ghz may not be inverted ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) , although its spectral shape ( including upper limits ) strongly indicates a spectral turnover around 2.0 ghz .",
    "the non - detection of n1 at 8.4 ghz suggests a relatively flat agn - like spectrum and a lower limit for the spectral index @xmath31 @xmath32 0.55 between 5.0 and 8.4 ghz , using s@xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 with s@xmath33 being the flux density at frequency @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , the radio brightness temperature @xmath37 10@xmath38 k ( table  [ tbl6 ] ) and the detection of strong hard x - ray emission and neutral iron line emission would argue for the presence of an agn in n1 .",
    "considering the available evidence , the southern nucleus may host both an agn and a ( circum-)nuclear starburst region .",
    "the h@xmath9o@xmath10maser features in ngc 6240 nearly coincide with the continuum peak of the southern nucleus @xcite .",
    "the narrow h@xmath9o@xmath10maser lines are redshifted by @xmath20 200@xmath4300 km s@xmath39 with respect to the systemic velocity of n1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may originate in the receding side of a compact rotating molecular disk at the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would also support the presence of an agn .",
    "alternatively , these narrow lines distributed over 120 km s@xmath39could be explained by wind maser emission as observed in the circinus galaxy @xcite .",
    "the southern nucleus n1 of ngc 6240 has characteristics that are comparable with those of component a of arp299 @xcite .",
    "the 8.4 ghz radio power of n1 of ( @xmath40 = 3.7 @xmath1 10@xmath41 w hz@xmath12 ) @xcite is only a factor of two more than the 8.4 ghz power of nucleus a of arp299 ( @xmath42=1.8 @xmath1 10@xmath41 w hz@xmath12 and @xmath43=2.9 @xmath1 10@xmath44 w hz@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "the compact source a of arp299 has been resolved into discrete sources at milliarcsecond - scale by recent evn observations and one of these sources ( a1 ) is the agn candidate with a flat spectral index of -0.13 @xmath45 0.11 @xcite .",
    "five bright and compact radio sources lie within 10 pc and are candidates of type - ii young radio supernovae @xcite .",
    "four of these five radio sources have flat or inverted radio spectra between 2.2 and 8.4 ghz , very similar to rs1 and rs2 near n1 in ngc 6240 .",
    "the luminous h@xmath9o@xmath10maser emission in arp299 is found towards both nuclei a and b1 @xcite and at a it coincides with its continuum peak at vla resolution @xcite . while this spatial coincidence may also suggest an agn association ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the maser in is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity and is likely associated with an outflow in a starforming environment .      in order to understand the observed spectra of the southern and northern nuclei ,",
    "model fitting may be used to explain the frequency turn - over at lower frequencies using a power - law plus pure free - free absorption ( ffa ) or synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "first , the ffa model for a nuclear spectrum is described by : @xmath46 where @xmath36 is the frequency in ghz , @xmath47 is the unobscured synchrotron flux density in mjy , @xmath48 is the optically thin non - thermal spectral index , and @xmath49 is the opacity at 1.0 ghz .",
    "this model describes all ffa in the foreground to the synchrotron emission source and assumes that all source components are subject to the same foreground opacity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second model of pure ssa is described as follows : @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the frequency in ghz , @xmath47@xmath51 will be close to the flux density , if the ssa coefficient @xmath51@xmath52 1 , and @xmath48 is the optically thin non - thermal spectral index .",
    "the parameters of the ffa and ssa spectral fits for n1 and n2 and the reduced @xmath53 values ( per degree of freedom ) have been summarized in table  [ tbl7 ] , and the fitted curves are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] . both the ffa and ssa models produce reliable fits for n1 with low values ( @xmath32 1.5 ) for the reduced @xmath53 with the ffa model being slightly worse but does not make good fits to n2 . however , since there is no compact source in n1 or n2 having a high brightness temperature , any synchrotron self - absorption in these nuclei is unlikely @xcite .",
    "using conventional energy equipartition arguments at lower radio frequencies , a turn - over frequency of 2.0 @xmath4 3.0 ghz for a self - absorbed source requires an equipartition brightness temperature of @xmath2010@xmath54 k @xcite .",
    "the observed brightness temperatures for our sources are only @xmath20 10@xmath55@xmath410@xmath56 k. better constraints of the nuclear properties of n1 in terms of model fitting requires more complete flux density measurements .",
    "while for n2 neither the pure ffa nor the pure ssa model can perfectly explain the spectral bending at 2@xmath43 ghz ( see table  [ tbl7 ] and figure  [ fig5 ] ) , the observed bending does indicate that free - free self - absorption by ionized foreground gas in a starburst environment is relevant .",
    "since there is also no hint of self - absorption in the merlin spectrum @xcite , the size of such an absorbing medium must be very small and between about 9.5 and 25 pc in linear size @xcite .",
    "similarly , the presence of an agn in n2 can not be confirmed from our evn data , except that the core - jet like structure , as also seen in the 1.7 and 2.4 ghz vlba images , could support the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "the radio source rs1 has a radio power at 8.4 ghz of 4.1 @xmath1 10@xmath44 w hz@xmath12 and a spectral index of @xmath57 @xmath30 0.34 in our epoch 2 observations .",

    "the radio power of rs2 is comparable with those of the vlbi sources associated with the nucleus a in while the power of rs1 is nearly a factor ten higher , which makes it 1250 times the 8.4 ghz radio power of of 6 @xmath1 10@xmath60 w hz@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "both rs1 and rs2 display a radio light curve with a long - term rise ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the upper limit for the source size of rs1 at the highest frequency 8.4 ghz is 1.5 @xmath1 0.6 pc ( table  [ tbl5 ] ) and the source is not sufficiently resolved by our evn synthesized beam .",
    "also , different evn beams resulting from different ( u , v ) coverage at each epoch make it difficult to make a reliable comparison of the intrinsic source sizes .",
    "speculation that rs1 could be the true southern nucleus , instead of n1 , may be ruled out because rs1 was not detected in the 8.4 ghz vlba observations ( 1999@xmath42001 ) and only appeared in 2003 .",
    "also its location is significantly offset from the positions of n1 in the 2.4 and 1.7 ghz vlba data .",
    "similarly , the possibility that rs1 represents ejecta from the active nucleus n1 may be ruled out because its offset ( 11 pc ) from n1 remained unchanged during 6 years and because rs1 is far from the known outflow structures seen in hi and oh southwest of n1 @xcite . the positional difference of 10 mas ( @xmath30 50 pc ) ( see table  @xmath61 ) between rs2 at 1.6 and 5.0 ghz and the source s1 at 1.7 and 2.3 ghz in vlba observations at epochs in 2000 and 2001 suggests that they are also different sources .",
    "the radio sources rs1 and rs2 have remained detectable for more than 6 years since 2003 . an important question is whether these sources are supernovae ( sne , interacting with the circumstellar matter ) or supernova remnants ( snrs , interacting with the dense ism ) . there is no evidence for expanding supernovae shells with the highest beam size of @xmath206 mas ( @xmath203 pc ) both in rs1 and rs2 between the two epochs from our data ( see table  @xmath62 ) .",
    "the range of radio luminosity of 10@xmath63 w hz@xmath12 of rs1 and rs2 is similar to the radio luminosity obtained for observed type ib / c or type ii radio supernovae ( rsne ) @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that rs1 and rs2 are sne or sn - snr transition objects .",
    "our data is insufficient to distinguish between the two cases and further sensitive vlbi monitoring would be required .",
    "the vlba data ( 1999@xmath42001 ) also displays two similar but weaker rsn or snr candidates rs3 and rs4 , the latter of which has a spectral index of @xmath64 @xmath30 0.35 .",
    "many nearby galaxies , such as the lirg , and ulirgs and , display compact radio sources that are evidence of ongoing ( circum-)nuclear starformation @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations of the merging galaxy arp220 have detected a total of 18 compact radio sources within the western nucleus of the galaxy , over half of which have radio properties that are consistent with type - ii supernovae interacting with the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "likewise , the nuclei in arp299 show 30 compact radio sources , 25 of which are associated with the northeastern nucleus a ( with an agn candidate ) and are spread over a region of 30 pc @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the sn@xmath4snr sources in ngc6240 with those found in other sources shows that the radio powers of rs1 and rs2 are equivalent to those of the most powerful sources found in m82 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although they are less powerful than those in arp220 .",
    "as a result the upper limits for the sizes of rs1 and rs2 lie in the upper range of the general relation between radio luminosity and diameter observed for galactic and extragalactic snr sources @xcite .",
    "this would suggests that the environmental conditions in the lirg ngc 6240 , and possibly the star formation initial mass function , can not yet be distinguished from those of the most luminous fir galaxies .",
    "we have conducted multi - frequency evn observations of the nuclear region of the merging galaxy ngc 6240 at two epochs .",
    "the new vlbi maps reveal the double radio nuclei of ngc 6240 at milliarcsecond resolution , that are consistent with the earlier vlbi images obtained with the vlba @xcite .",
    "the radio spectra from both nuclei suggest a spectral turn - over between 2 and 3 ghz . the spectrum of the southern nucleus n1 may be explained in terms of free - free absorption , although this explanation is still limited by having source flux densities with insufficient frequency coverage at each epoch .",
    "there is no clear interpretation for the spectrum of the northern nucleus n2 .    questions still remain about the true nature of the two radio nuclei and whether they both contain a radio - quiet agn , a simple starburst , or a composite with an agn and a circum - nuclear starburst .",
    "we suggest that the southern nucleus hosts an agn and a circum - nuclear starburst , as evidenced by the x - ray data and the radio sources .",
    "the association of the h@xmath9o@xmath10maser with the nuclear source is still unknown .",
    "however , it is not clear that our data , together with earlier vlba measurements , confirm the presence of an agn at the northern nucleus .    the radio components rs1 and rs2 could be interpreted as long - lived radio supernovae that result from ongoing circum - nuclear star formation at n1 .",
    "the radio spectrum of both sources is relatively flat and their location remains unchanged within error over about 6 years .",
    "more radio supernovae may have been detected in earlier observations around the active nucleus of n1 , which groups together with other well - known starburst nuclei that display rsne or snrs in their nuclei , such as , , and @xcite .",
    "radio interferometric observations are a powerful method to identify ongoing nuclear starformation and detect radio supernovae and supernova remnants in extragalactic sources .",

    "<S> the european vlbi network ( evn ) has been used at two epochs in 2003 and 2009 to obtain multi - frequency high - resolution images of the merger galaxy ngc6240 in order to study the radio properties of all compact high - brightness components in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our observations at milli - arcsecond resolution detected the northern and southern nuclei and two radio components , which we interpret as long - lived luminous supernovae associated with the circum - nuclear starburst activity at the southern nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the new vlbi data support the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) together with starburst activity at the southern nucleus and provides some evidence for an agn at the northern nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the two nuclei both display an inverted spectrum at lower ghz frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the southern nucleus indicates thermal free - free absorption on parsec scales , consistent with the presence of an agn . </S>"
