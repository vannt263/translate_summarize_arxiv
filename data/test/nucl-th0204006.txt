    "it has been pointed out in previous publications @xcite that various models in quantum field theory ( qft ) , including qed , can be reformulated , using mediating - field green functions , in such a way that exact few - particle eigenstates of the resulting partially truncated hamiltonian can be obtained .",
    "this approach was then applied to two - body eigenstates in the scalar yukawa ( wick - cutkosky ) theory @xcite .",
    "we implement such an approach to qed in this paper .",
    "the lagrangian of two fermion fields , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , interacting electromagnetically , is @xmath2 the corresponding euler - lagrange equations of motion are the coupled dirac - maxwell equations , @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 the equations ( [ 1.2 ] ) - ( [ 1.4 ] ) can be decoupled in part by using the well - known @xcite formal solution of the maxwell equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) , namely @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a green function ( or photon propagator in qft terminology ) , defined by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a solution of the homogeneous ( or `` free field '' ) equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) with @xmath11 .",
    "we recall , in passing , that equation ( [ 1.7 ] ) does not define the covariant green function @xmath8 uniquely . for one thing , one can always add a solution of the homogeneous equation ( _ eq .",
    "_ ( [ 1.7 ] ) with @xmath12 .",
    "this allows for a certain freedom in the choice of @xmath13 , as is discussed in standard texts ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) , like that of eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) , requires a choice of gauge .",
    "however , we do not need to specify one at this stage .",
    "substitution of the formal solution ( [ 1.6 ] ) into equations ( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) yields the  partially reduced \" equations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 these are nonlinear coupled dirac equations for two different fermion fields . to our knowledge no exact ( analytic or numeric ) solutions of equations ( [ 1.8 ] ) and ( [ 1.9 ] ) for classical fields have been reported in the literature , even for the case of a single fermion field ( say @xmath16 ) , though approximate ( perturbative ) solutions have been discussed by various authors , particularly barut and his co - workers ( see refs . @xcite and citations therein ) . however , our interest here is in the quantized field theory .",
    "the partially reduced equations ( [ 1.8])-([1.9 ] ) are derivable from the stationary action principle @xmath17 = \\delta \\int { \\cal l}_{r}\\ ; d^4x = 0,\\ ] ] with the lagrangian density @xmath18 provided that the green function is symmetric in the sense that @xmath19 one can proceed to do conventional covariant perturbation theory using the reformulated qed lagrangian ( [ 1.11 ] )",
    ". the interaction part of ( [ 1.11 ] ) has a somewhat modified structure from that of the usual formulation of qed .",
    "thus , there are two interaction terms .",
    "the last term of ( [ 1.11 ] ) is a `` current - current '' interaction which contains the photon propagator sandwiched between the fermionic currents . as such",
    ", it corresponds to feynman diagrams without external photon lines .",
    "the terms containing @xmath20 corresponds to diagrams that can not be generated by the term containing @xmath21 , particularly diagrams involving external photon lines ( care would have to be taken not to double count physical effects ) .",
    "however , we shall not pursue perturbation theory in this work .",
    "rather , we shall consider an approach that allows one to write down some unorthodox but exact eigenstates of a truncated model , in which terms involving @xmath22 are ignored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we quantize the system using the canonical equal time formalism in the schrdinger picture . in section 3",
    "an unconventional  empty \" vacuum state is used to construct exact one- , two- , and three - fermion eigenstates of the hamiltonian , truncated to exclude states with free ( physical ) photons . in section 4",
    "we show that the resulting two - fermion equation is the breit equation in the coulomb gauge , but that it is the eddington - gaunt equation in the lorentz gauge . in section 5",
    "we demonstrate that the breit equation can be obtained in the lorentz gauge , provided that higher - order retardation effects are taken into account .",
    "the reduction of the breit equation to radial form is described briefly in section 6 . for states of zero total angular momentum ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "four coupled radial equations are shown to arise .",
    "the analytical structure of their solutions is studied in section 7 .",
    "perturbative @xmath24 corrections to the rydberg spectrum of @xmath23 states are obtained in section 8 . in the case of equal rest masses",
    "the @xmath25 state equations have no unusual singularities and can be solved numerically . some of these results are presented and discussed in section 9 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to the study of @xmath26 states . in the section 10 the set of eight coupled radial first - order differential equations",
    "is reduced to four first - order ones and then to two second - order schrdinger - like equations .",
    "they are solved perturbatively in section 11 and @xmath24 relativistic corrections to the non - relativistic mass spectrum are obtained . a summary and concluding remarks are given in section 12 .",
    "we consider this theory in the canonical , equal - time formalism . to this end",
    "we write down the hamiltonian density corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ 1.11 ] ) @xmath27 where we have not written out the hamiltonian density for the free @xmath28 field .",
    "equal - time quantization corresponds to the imposition of anticommutation rules for the fermion fields , namely @xmath29 and all others vanish .",
    "in addition , if @xmath30 , there are the usual commutation rules for the @xmath20 field , and commutation of the @xmath20 field operators with the @xmath31 and @xmath32 field operators .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 2.1 ] ) contains an interaction term that is nonlocal in time , which can complicate the transition to a quantized theory .",
    "we shall avoid this problem by working in the schrdinger picture with @xmath33 in the expressions for the field operators and currents , that is @xmath34 , @xmath35 , etc . in equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to neglecting higher order retardation effects .",
    "thereupon we obtain the result @xmath36 where @xmath37 for example , in the lorentz gauge ( @xmath38 ) , we have @xmath39 thus , in the schrdinger picture , the third term of the hamiltonian density ( [ 2.1 ] ) takes on the form @xmath40 in the remainder of this paper , we shall consider the simplified model without the interaction terms in ( [ 2.1 ] ) that contains @xmath41 .",
    "such a model is suitable for describing few - fermion states interacting via virtual photon exchange , but without decay or annihilation involving free ( physical ) photons . in short ,",
    "in all that follows we consider the field theory based on the hamiltonian density of ( [ 2.1 ] ) but with @xmath42 .",
    "an attractive feature of this model is that exact few - fermion eigenstates of the hamiltonian can be obtained .",
    "we consider now the model for which the hamiltonian , in the schrdinger picture with @xmath33 , is given by the expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is given in equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "note , again , that the terms in @xmath48 have been suppressed , so that processes in which free ( physical ) photons are emitted or absorbed are not accommodated .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath49 has the same structure as the coulomb - qed ( cqed ) hamiltonian , that is the hamiltonian of qed in the coulomb gauge , but with the `` transverse - photon '' part ( that contains @xmath50 ) turned off .",
    "indeed @xmath49 would beidentical to @xmath51 if the indeces @xmath52 and @xmath53 took on only the value @xmath54 in equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) ( as it is , @xmath55 in eq.([2.6 ] ) ) .",
    "it has been shown earlier @xcite that exact two - fermion eigenstates of @xmath51 can be written down if we use an unconventional ( or `` empty '' ) vacuum state , @xmath56 , defined by @xmath57 the same is true of the present more realistic model , as we point out below .    the unconventional empty vacuum definition ( [ 3.4 ] )",
    "means that @xmath58 is interpreted as a ( free ) dirac - particle annihilation operator , while @xmath59 is , correspondingly , a dirac - particle creation operator . by `` dirac - particle '' we mean one described by the full dirac spinor , including positive and negative frequency components .",
    "( recall that in the conventional approach , _",
    "i.e. _ using a dirac `` filled negative energy sea '' vacuum which is annihilated by the positive frequency component of @xmath31 , it is only the negative - frequency component of @xmath31 that is an antiparticle creation operator , and the positive - frequency component of @xmath60 that is the particle creation operator ) .    with these conventions ,",
    "we write the normal - ordered hamiltonian @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 , etc .",
    "the normal ordering is achieved by using the anticommutation rules ( [ 2.2 ] ) as usual ; but note that it is not identical to the conventional normal ordering because of the unconventional empty vacuum that is being used , and the unconventional definition of @xmath31 and @xmath32 as annihilation operators and of @xmath64 as creation operators . to underscore this unconventional procedure we use the notation @xmath65 rather than @xmath66 in equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "we note that the state defined by @xmath67 is a @xmath68 c - number coefficient vector , is an eigenstate of @xmath65 ( eq . ( [ 3.5 ] ) ) provided that @xmath69 satisfies the equation @xmath70 which is the usual time - independent one - particle dirac equation ( with positive and negative energy solutions ) , so that @xmath69 is a dirac spinor .",
    "therefore , we refer to @xmath71 as a one - dirac - fermion state .    similarly , the two - dirac - fermion state , @xmath72 ( summation on @xmath73 implied ) is an eigenstate of @xmath65 ( equation ( [ 3.5 ] ) ) provided that the @xmath74 eigenmatrix @xmath75 satisfies the equation @xmath76^t + q_1 q_2 g_{\\mu \\nu}({\\bx } - { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$y$ } } } ) { \\tilde \\gamma}^\\mu f({\\bx},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$y$ } } } ) ( { \\tilde \\gamma}^\\nu)^t = e\\ , f({\\bx},{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$y$}}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and the superscript @xmath79 indicates the transpose of the matrix in question .",
    "the detailed form of the interaction matrix @xmath80 depends on the choice of gauge .",
    "this equation ( [ 3.9 ] ) is a two - fermion dirac - like , or breit - like , equation with positive and negative energy solutions , and is , in this respect , different from those obtained in the conventional approach @xcite-@xcite in which the negative - energy solutions do not arise .",
    "we note , in passing , that if the interaction is turned off in eq .",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) ( _ i.e. _ @xmath81 ) , then the solution can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are solutions of the one - body dirac eigenvalue equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that in @xmath85 $ ] , the index @xmath86 corresponds to particle 1 ( with coordinates @xmath87 ) while @xmath88 corresponds to particle 2 ( with coordinates @xmath89 ) .    in the rest frame of the two - fermion system ( _ i.e. _ when @xmath90 is taken to be an eigenstate of the momentum operator for this qft , with eigenvalue 0 ) , equation ( [ 3.9 ] )",
    "reduces to an analogous equation in the single relative co - ordinate @xmath91 : @xmath92^t + q_1 q_2 g_{\\mu \\nu}({\\br } ) { \\tilde \\gamma}^\\mu f({\\br } ) ( { \\tilde \\gamma}^\\nu)^t = e \\ , f({\\br}).\\ ] ] it can , therefore , be reduced to a set of ordinary , coupled , first - order differential equations for states of given @xmath93 .",
    "such equations can , at the very least , be solved numerically .",
    "this is a straightforward , though somewhat tedious , problem @xcite which we address below .",
    "the structure of the hamiltonian @xmath65 ( eq . ( [ 3.5 ] ) ) is such that generalizations to systems of more than two fermions are readily obtained .",
    "thus , the three fermion state , corresponding to a system like @xmath94 , defined by @xmath95 is an exact eigenstate of @xmath65 with eigenvalue @xmath96 , provided that the @xmath97 coefficient functions @xmath98 satisfy the three - body dirac - like equation , @xmath99_{\\alpha_1 \\alpha}\\ ; f_{\\alpha \\alpha_2 \\alpha_3}({\\bx}_1,{\\bx}_2,{\\bx}_3 ) + \\left[h_{m_1}({\\bx}_2)\\right]_{\\alpha_2 \\alpha}\\;f_{\\alpha_1 \\alpha \\alpha_3}({\\bx}_1,{\\bx}_2,{\\bx}_3 )   \\nn   \\\\ { } + \\left[h_{m_2}({\\bx}_3 ) \\right]_{\\alpha_3 \\alpha}\\ ; f_{\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2 \\alpha}({\\bx}_1,{\\bx}_2,{\\bx}_3 ) + q_1 q_2 g_{\\mu \\nu } ( { \\bx}_3 - { \\bx}_1)\\ ; ( { \\tilde   \\gamma}^\\mu)_{\\alpha_1 \\alpha}\\;({\\tilde \\gamma}^\\nu)_{\\alpha_3 \\beta}\\ ;",

    "nevertheless , the reduction of the equation for states of given @xmath93 is more formidable than in the two - body case .",
    "even then one is left with the full complexity of a relativistic three - body system .",
    "we shall not consider solutions of the three - body equation ( [ 3.12 ] ) in this paper .",
    "at this stage we must specify the choice of green s function , that is a choice of gauge .",
    "we could use any gauge , in principle , but we shall use the coulomb gauge , as this avoids nonphysical degrees of freedom and the need to take account of auxiliary conditions ( such as @xmath100 in the lorentz gauge ) .",
    "we use the relation @xmath101 and note that @xmath102 in the coulomb gauge @xcite . therefore , if we use eq .",

    ", we see that equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) is nothing other than the breit equation @xcite , written in the rest frame of the two - fermion system .",
    "if we had used the lorentz - gauge form of the green function ( [ 2.5 ] ) , equation ( [ 3.10 ] ) would take on the form @xmath109^t + v(r ) \\left [ f(\\br ) -",

    "= e\\ , f(\\br ) , \\ ] ] which is recognized to be the eddington - gaunt equation @xcite . the gaunt equation , unlike the breit equation ,",
    "does not contain even lowest - order retardation effects ( see , also , section 5 , following ) .",
    "therefore , it will yield energy eigenvalues that will differ from those of the breit equation already at @xmath24 .    note , also , that equations ( [ 4.5 ] ) and ( [ 4.6 ] ) , with the terms involving @xmath110 left out , become identical to the coulomb - qed model discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "although we shall use the coulomb gauge in this paper , it is instructive to see how , in the lorentz gauge , one needs to keep retardation effects at least to lowest non - vanishing order in order to achieve the same results .",
    "the green function of the dalembert equation in the lorentz gauge has the form : @xmath111 the reduced lagrangian @xmath112 in this case reads ( with @xmath113 ) : @xmath114 where the potential of electromagnetic interparticle interaction is @xmath115 j^\\mu(\\tp,\\bxp ) .\\ ] ] thus , the lagrangian ( [ 2 ] ) is nonlocal in time . because of this the standard hamiltonization procedure is not applicable .    in order to employ the canonical hamiltonian formalism",
    "it is necessary to convert this lagrangian to single - time form .",
    "we shall do so by employing a procedure which takes into account the retardation effects approximately .    using the substitution @xmath116 in ( [ 3 ] ) and expanding the current @xmath88 in a taylor series in @xmath117",
    ", we obtain the result @xmath118 which reduces the potential ( [ 3 ] ) to the form : @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "the functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 satisfy the relation @xmath123 the terms of odd power in @xmath117 in the expansion ( [ 4 ] ) vanish , because @xmath124 is an even function of @xmath117 ( _ c.f . _",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) ) . as a result",
    ", the interaction lagrangian @xmath125 ( up to surface terms ) takes the following single - time form : @xmath126 where @xmath127 ( hereafter we omit the common time argument @xmath128 ) .    the quantized theory based on the lagrangian @xmath129 ( the coulomb qed mentioned in section 3 )",
    "was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the relativistic kinematics of the fermion fields exactly , but describes their electromagnetic interaction with the  transverse - photon \" part turned off .",
    "the terms @xmath130 and @xmath131 can be treated as first - order corrections to @xmath132 , thus providing the approximate single - time form @xmath133 for the reduced nonlocal lagrangian @xmath112 ( _ c.f . _ eq .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) ) .",
    "other terms following from the expansion are corrections of higher order .",
    "they will not be considered in the present paper .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath134 leads to euler - lagrange equations which are second - order in time derivatives , because of the term @xmath131 .",
    "thus , it describes the system with twice as many degrees of freedom as @xmath132 does , because @xmath60 are no longer the conjugate momenta of @xmath31 .",
    "this changes completely the dynamical content of the fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "since the second - order time derivatives occur in small terms only , they should be eliminated by means of the euler - lagrange equations of a lower - order approximation .",
    "but the resulting field equations are then not necessarily the euler - lagrange equations of a known lagrangian .",
    "thus the transition to the hamiltonian and to a canonical quantum description becomes unclear .    to avoid this difficulty it is tempting to eliminate the time derivative of the charge density @xmath135 directly in @xmath131 by taking into account the conservation law @xmath136",
    "this conservation law is a consequence of the euler - lagrange equations , which follow from the reduced lagrangian @xmath112 as well as from the truncated one @xmath132 .",
    "however , the direct use of the equations of motion ( or their consequences ) in the lagrangian is not a correct procedure : it changes the equations of motion themselves .",
    "this fact was first emphasized in the case of the golubenkov - smorodinskii lagrangian @xcite and then subsequently discussed in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "instead , one can use the method of  double zero \" , used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our case",
    "this consists of the following modification of the lagrangian : @xmath137 where @xmath138 it is easy to see that the term @xmath139 possesses the property : @xmath140 so that it does not change the variational problem to the accuracy required . on the other hand , it cancels those terms of @xmath134 which are quadratic in time derivatives of the fields .",
    "thus the modified lagrangian @xmath141 yields equations of motion , which are first order in the time derivatives of the particle fields @xmath142 .    next , we perform the following transformation of the field variables : @xmath143 where @xmath144 the transformation ( [ 17 ] ) can be regarded as an approximate @xmath145 gauge transformation , which however is not canonical due to the dependence of @xmath146 on the fields .",
    "this transformation removes time derivatives from the interaction part of @xmath147 .",
    "to the accuracy required , and up to surface terms , lagrangian @xmath141 can be written in the form @xmath148 where the notations @xmath149 , @xmath150 , _ etc . _",
    "mean that the fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 are replaced by @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "integrating the last term of @xmath141 by parts , omitting surface terms , and using equations ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , we reduce the lagrangian @xmath141 to the form @xmath153 where @xmath154 this formulation allows us to treat the variables @xmath155 and @xmath156as the canonical conjugates of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "that is , we impose the anticommutation relations ( [ 2.2 ] ) on the underscored fields , and not on the original ones , when performing the quantization .",
    "thereafter , since the hamiltonian @xmath157 is formally identical with the coulomb gauge hamiltonian ( _ c.f . _",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) with ( [ 4.4 ] ) ) , calculations like those of section 4 lead to the breit equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) .",
    "although two fermion equations have been around since the 1920s , their full reduction to radial form is of more recent vintage ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the reduction of equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) to radial form is essentially the same as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , hence all the details shall not be repeated here .",
    "as shown in @xcite , we note that eq.([4.5 ] ) has the schrdinger equation as a non - relativistic limit , and the dirac equation as a one - body limit if one of @xmath158 .    for the two - fermion state @xmath159 , eq .",

    "these four bispinor harmonics form an orthonormal set , in the sense that @xmath187 , where @xmath188 and the integrations are taken over the entire solid angle .",
    "the eight radial functions in the bispinors ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) are solutions of the coupled radial equations that are obtained by substituting ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) , ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) into equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) and equating the coefficients of the four independent bispinor harmonics .    we make use of the following identities in carrying out the radial reduction : @xmath189 where @xmath190 is any @xmath167 bispinor harmonic , @xmath191 a radial function , and @xmath192 , and @xmath193 . in addition , we note the following useful properties of the above bispinors harmonics : @xmath194 where @xmath195 it is evident from equations ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) that , in general , eight coupled radial equations are obtained , for arbitrary @xmath26 .",

    "<S> we consider a reformulation of qed in which covariant green functions are used to solve for the electromagnetic field in terms of the fermion fields . it is shown that exact few - fermion eigenstates of the resulting hamiltonian can be obtained in the canonical equal - time formalism for the case where there are no free photons . </S>",
    "<S> these eigenstates lead to two- and three - body dirac - like equations with electromagnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> perturbative and some numerical solutions of the two - body equations are presented for positronium and muonium - like systems , for various strengths of the coupling .    </S>",
