    "the term _ cardinal interpolation _ refers to interpolation of data given at the integer lattice ( or multi - integer lattice in higher dimensions ) .",
    "it was i. j. schoenberg s work on cardinal spline interpolation that brought about an intense study of the subject .",
    "many avenues of study have been explored , including forming interpolation operators from translates of certain radial basis functions ( rbfs ) .",
    "works by buhmann , baxter , riemenschneider , and sivakumar @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) have explored many cardinal interpolation operators of this type .",
    "some of the radial basis functions that have been considered are the gaussian kernel , the thin plate spline , the hardy multiquadric , and the inverse multiquadric .",
    "radial basis cardinal interpolation also enjoys a strong connection with classical sampling theory , as evidenced by much of the aforementioned literature .",
    "this connection continues to be explored in recent developments by the second author @xcite , and by parts of this article . as this is one of the most interesting aspects of cardinal interpolation",
    ", we provide some of the motivation .",
    "recall the one - dimensional whittaker  kotelnikov ",
    "shannon sampling theorem , which states that a bandlimited function , @xmath10 , ( say with band size @xmath11 ) can be recovered uniformly by the series @xmath12 , where the @xmath13 function is suitably defined so that it takes value 1 at the origin , and 0 at all the other integers .",
    "one observation about this series is that the @xmath13 function decays slowly ( as @xmath14 ) , and so to approximate the series by truncation for example , one would have to use quite a lot of data points of @xmath10 to get a reasonable degree of accuracy .",
    "however , there is a way of approximating the @xmath13 series above : we seek to replace the @xmath13 function with a so - called _ fundamental function _ ( or _ cardinal function _ ) , @xmath15 , that preserves the property that @xmath15 takes value 1 at the origin and 0 at all other integers .",
    "we then form a function @xmath16 the trade - off here is that while @xmath17 is not pointwise equal to the function @xmath10 , it does interpolate @xmath10 at the integer lattice , and moreover , the fundamental function @xmath15 may be constructed so that it decays much more rapidly than the @xmath13 function .",
    "precisely , one may construct a fundamental function from a given radial basis function , @xmath18 , which has the form @xmath19    in the case of the gaussian kernel , @xmath20 , the fundamental function decays exponentially , whereas the fundamental function for the hardy multiquadric , @xmath21 , decays as @xmath22 .",
    "so we give up the pointwise equality of the wks sampling theorem in exchange for a series that converges more rapidly , while also ensuring that @xmath17 is close to @xmath10 in the @xmath23 norm .",
    "this paper primarily considers the fundamental functions and cardinal interpolation operators associated with general multiquadrics , @xmath0 , which have thus far only been considered for certain exponents @xmath24 .",
    "interpolation with fundamental functions has too long a history to recount here ; however , @xcite offers a good introduction using radial basis functions .",
    "using below as a starting point is especially popular since it allows one to solve problems in the fourier transform domain .",
    "many authors have used similar techniques for various radial basis functions . in @xcite , riemenschneider and",
    "sivakumar proved several results pertaining to the gaussian .",
    "multiquadric cardinal interpolation has been studied in a similar way by buhmann and micchelli @xcite , baxter @xcite , baxter and sivakumar @xcite , riemenschneider and sivakumar @xcite , among others .",
    "compactly supported radial basis functions have been studied by buhmann @xcite and wendland @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section [ secbasic ] provides the necessary preliminaries and a discussion of applications and calculations of the fundamental functions ; section [ secbaxteranalogue ] shows recovery results for cardinal interpolation of bandlimited functions in any dimension via interpolants of the form discussed above .",
    "section [ secpropfundamental ] contains decay rates and information about the univariate fundamental functions associated with the general multiquadrics for a broad range of exponents . in section [ seceastjournal ] , we consider the cardinal interpolation operators acting on data in traditional sequence spaces and calculate decay rates , bounds on the operator norms , and also explore some convergence properties in terms of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "section [ secexamples ] provides some interesting concrete examples based on the theoretical results from the previous section .",
    "finally , section [ secproofs ] provides the technical proofs of the statements in section [ secpropfundamental ] .",
    "if @xmath26 is an interval , then let @xmath27 , @xmath28 , be the usual lebesgue space over @xmath29 with its usual norm .",
    "if no set is specified , we mean @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , denote by @xmath31 the usual sequence spaces indexed by the set @xmath32 ; if no index set is given , we refer to @xmath33",
    ". we will use @xmath34 to denote the natural numbers including 0 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the space of schwartz functions on @xmath36 , that is the collection of infinitely differentiable functions @xmath18 such that for all multi - indices @xmath24 and @xmath37 , @xmath38    the fourier transform of a schwartz function @xmath18 is given by @xmath39 thus the inversion formula is @xmath40 in the event that these formulas do not hold , then the fourier transform should be interpreted in the sense of tempered distributions .",
    "recall that if @xmath10 is a tempered distribution , then its fourier transform is the tempered distribution defined by @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be fixed ; then define the @xmath45-dimensional _ general multiquadric _ by @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the euclidean distance on @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath48 , the generalized fourier transform of @xmath4 is given by the following ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.15 ) ) : @xmath49 where @xcite @xmath50 @xmath51 is called the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "we note that both @xmath4 and its fourier transform are radial .",
    "it is also clear from the definition that @xmath52 is symmetric in its order ; that is , @xmath53 for any @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath55 , then the generalized fourier transform of @xmath4 involves a measure and so can not be expressed as a function .",
    "now suppose that @xmath48 is fixed .",
    "to define the _ fundamental function _ associated with the general multiquadric , we first define the following function @xmath56 we will see that @xmath57 , and so the function @xmath58 is well - defined and continuous .",
    "furthermore , we will show that @xmath3 is a _ fundamental function _ , also called a _",
    "cardinal function _ , which means that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the kronecker delta .",
    "additionally , @xmath3 has the form @xmath61    throughout the paper , we will use @xmath62 to denote an absolute constant due to the use of @xmath25 as the shape parameter of the multiquadric .",
    "the value of the particular constant may change from line to line , and we use subscripts to denote dependence on certain parameters when needed .",
    "interpolation schemes involving fundamental functions as in have been studied for quite some time , and there are many aspects to the theory .",
    "for example , such methods enjoy applications to geoscience @xcite and sampling theory @xcite .",
    "recently , investigations have considered interpolation via radial kernels on manifolds @xcite . for a galerkin type method for solving pdes using meshless interpolation on the sphere ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "given the widespread applications of radial basis function approximation , it is of import to the computational community to determine stable ways of evaluating the approximants .",
    "consequently , there is a substantial literature dealing with accuracy and stability of different computational methodologies for radial basis function approximation .",
    "we do not claim to list all of these methods , but at least a sampling is in order .",
    "we note that approximating is typically very difficult , especially if one dilates the lattice .",
    "one way around this is the use of indirect computational methods to approximate the rbf interpolant @xcite ( for a discussion specifically related to multiquadrics , see @xcite ) .",
    "another technique involves a change of basis method @xcite , while work by fasshauer and mccourt @xcite uses an eigenfunction decomposition to provide stable reconstruction using gaussians .",
    "another quite promising method has recently been considered in which so - called _ local lagrange functions _ are used to approximate rather than the global ones @xcite .",
    "many of these results revolve around the situation of interpolation at finitely many data sites , which is of a somewhat different nature than we are considering here . for the interested reader",
    ", we also mention that these methods of cardinal interpolation have , at their core , a deep connection to the classical spline theory instigated by schoenberg ( see @xcite and references therein ) and continued by many followers .",
    "the underlying principle is that many of the results in spline interpolation theory have natural analogues via rbfs , and the problem at hand may determine which method is more useful .      here , we provide some brief illustrations of the fundamental functions we have mentioned above .",
    "figure [ figsinc1d ] shows the univariate fundamental function associated with the inverse multiquadric and the sinc function for comparison .",
    "@xmath63{acom_sinc_imq - eps - converted - to.pdf}\\ ] ]    @xmath64{multivariatefundamental - eps - converted - to.pdf}\\ ] ]    the fundamental function was calculated by truncating the series in and using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) method to approximate @xmath3 .",
    "the same method may be applied for the multivariate version , as figure [ figsinc ] shows .",
    "when an interpolation scheme depends on a parameter , questions of convergence naturally arise . this question has been addressed by several authors . in @xcite , baxter examines the hardy multiquadric , while the gaussian is studied in @xcite by riemenschneider and sivakumar and in @xcite by hangelbroek , narcowich , madych , and ward . in a more general context , ` increasingly flat ' radial basis functions are the focus of driscoll and fornberg in @xcite , while the second author worked with ` regular families ' of cardinal interpolants in @xcite .    in this section , we show that the result obtained by baxter @xcite holds not only for the traditional hardy multiquadric ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) but rather for all @xmath48 .",
    "we consider interpolation of bandlimited ( or paley - wiener ) functions in any dimension , and show that the cardinal interpolant converges to the function as the shape parameter @xmath25 tends to infinity .",
    "general multiquadrics were not considered for quite some time in this setting , but in @xcite convergence results for cardinal interpolation of bandlimited functions were shown for a restricted range of exponents .",
    "however , the analysis there was of a more general nature , so here we show that a more specific analysis yields convergence results for the full range @xmath66    we note that the results of this section have very close ties to classical sampling theory , which studies the reconstruction of certain classes of signals from their discrete samples . as mentioned above",
    ", these considerations lead to alternative methods for approximating the sampling series given by the wks sampling theorem for bandlimited signals .",
    "let @xmath45 be the dimension , and @xmath48 and @xmath44 be fixed .",
    "it is evident from that @xmath67 does not change sign . therefore , @xmath68 for all @xmath69 . from , it is also evident that @xmath70 . to show that @xmath71 we begin with the following lemma .",
