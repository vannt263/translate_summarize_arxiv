    "we come up with the formalism in several stages . first , we write down the standard propagation equations of stokes parameters @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 in the uniform thermal plasma @xcite in a locally flat co - moving reference frame with synchrotron emissivities / absorptivities from @xcite .",
    "we take faraday rotation / conversion coefficients from @xcite , as the other published derivation of faraday conversion coefficients @xcite is a very crude approximation .",
    "second , we parallel propagate the basis vectors along the null geodesic from the observer s plane to account for gr rotation of the basis .",
    "third , with proper gauges on wave vector potential we write down the covariant equations of polarized radiative transfer .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the matrix of absorptivities and propagation coefficients generalizes in the polarized transfer analogously to the unpolarized case .",
    "the dynamical model used in the transfer starts with adiabatic 3d grmhd simulations of thick accretion flow onto the kerr black hole ( bh ) with spins @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8",
    "@xmath9 we average the flow velocity , magnetic field , rms magnetic field , gas density and pressure for the quasi - steady period of the developed accretion and separate the electron temperature @xmath10 from the proton temperature @xmath11 by applying the heating prescription from @xcite .",
    "the dynamical model is smoothly extended to large radii @xmath12 to take into account the faraday rotation effect at large distances from the bh .",
    "we perform the gr polarized radiative transfer for each spin for a set of inclination angles @xmath13 and compare the specific fluxes , linear polarization fractions ( lp ) , and circular polarization fractions ( cp ) to observations .",
    "we find , that the extreme spins @xmath14 @xmath15 do not fit all the observations well .",
    "they require lower density @xmath16  @xmath17 near bh to fit the flux at @xmath18  ghz , but faraday depolarization fails at these densities leading to high lp at @xmath19  ghz compared to the observed value @xcite .",
    "the preferred value of the inclination angle @xmath1 is coincident with that in @xcite .",
    "the spin value @xmath0 gives the best fit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) , though spin @xmath20 produces good fits as well .",
    "imaging produces some unexpected results .",
    "as our simulation appears to be substantially sub - keplerian and have significant thermal support , the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) loses its importance and the black hole shadow is not always seen .",
