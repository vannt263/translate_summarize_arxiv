    "it is well known that radio waves propagating in the interstellar medium ( ism ) are scattered by the irregularities in the galactic electron density .",
    "the scattering in turn gives rise to a number of observable phenomena . among others ,",
    "these include angular broadening and intensity fluctuations ( both in time and frequency ) of compact radio sources . while a nuisance in many radio astronomical observations , these phenomena can be used to investigate the nature of the irregularities in the interstellar plasma density .",
    "these density irregularities are in turn believed to follow the fluctuations in the interstellar kinetic and magnetic energies .",
    "ideally one would like to invert observations of radio scintillation and scattering to determine the statistics of the plasma density . as noted by narayan ( 1992 )",
    "this inverse problem is not well posed and one must rely on modeling methods .",
    "a complete prediction of scintillation observables requires an _ a priori _ knowledge of both the form of the spatial power spectrum of the electron density fluctuations and the distribution of the scattering material along the line of sight . for a given profile of the distribution of the scattering material ,",
    "one may compare observations and predictions and so constrain the functional form of the spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum provides useful insight into the physics of the plasma irregularities .",
    "hence a knowledge of the form of the density spectrum becomes central in both predicting scintillation phenomena and understanding the physics of the interstellar plasma . in this paper , we revisit the investigation of the form of the density spectrum .    a commonly used model for the density spectrum has been based on a power - law model with a large range between `` inner '' and `` outer '' scales ( e.g.  rickett 1977 ) : @xmath1 \\ , \\mbox{. } \\label{eq : extpowerlaw } \\ ] ] here @xmath2 is the magnitude of the three - dimensional wavenumber @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the strength of fluctuations ( with a weak dependence on distance @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is the spectral exponent , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the inner and outer scales respectively . for @xmath9 , we obtain the _ simple _ power - law model : @xmath10 .",
    "armstrong , rickett , & spangler ( 1995 ) have constructed an empirical density spectrum by combining radio scintillation observations in the local ism ( @xmath11 1  kpc ) with measurements of the differential faraday rotation angles and large - scale electron density gradients .",
    "they have shown the power spectrum to be consistent with a simple kolmogorov power - law model ( @xmath12 ) over an astronomical 10 orders of magnitude in wavenumber scale ( @xmath13m@xmath14m@xmath15 ) .",
    "the kolmogorov spectrum in density suggests a turbulent cascade in the magnetic and kinetic energies . this has lead to several theoretical investigations of the generation and maintenance of hydromagnetic turbulence in the ism ( e.g.  pouquet , 1978 ; higdon 1984 & 1986 ; biskamp , 1993 : sridhar & goldreich 1994 ; goldreich & sridhar 1995 and 1997 ) . however , the armstrong et al .  study combined observations from many lines of sight and the scatter among them leaves a substantial uncertainty in the exponent @xmath6 .",
    "a list of symbols is given in table 3 .    in spite of the positive evidence for the simple kolmogorov spectrum , substantial observational inconsistencies remain .",
    "for instance , long - term refractive intensity scintillations of some pulsars have modulation indices as much as a factor of 2 larger than predicted by the simple kolmogorov model ( cf.gupta , rickett , & coles 1993 ) .",
    "other discrepancies are revealed in the diffractive dynamic spectra of pulsars . on some occasions , periodic fringes",
    "are observed , which are not predicted by the simple kolmogorov model ( cf .  roberts & ables 1982 ; cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; rickett , lyne , & gupta 1997 ; gupta , bhat & rao , 1999 ) ; in addition , sloping bands in the dynamic spectra often persist longer than predicted by the model ( cf.gupta , rickett , & lyne 1994 ; bhat , rao & gupta , 1999b bhat , gupta & rao , 1999c ) .",
    "further for some pulsars , the decorrelation bandwidth has larger amplitude variations than predicted for the kolmogorov spectrum ( bhat , gupta & rao , 1999c ) .",
    "such anomalies suggest the presence of large refractive structures giving rise to the focusing and defocusing of the scattered ray bundles .",
    "the interference of the ray bundles can also explain the occasional fringes observed in the dynamic spectra of some pulsars . given the relatively frequent occurrence of such events",
    ", one can ask whether they can be considered as mere occasional anomalies or should be considered as a widespread phenomenon intrinsic to the spectrum on a grand scale .",
    "the observational inconsistencies suggest the need for an enhancement in the power on the large `` refractive '' ( 10@xmath16  m to 10@xmath17  m ) spatial scales relative to the power on the small `` diffractive '' ( 10@xmath18  m to 10@xmath19  m ) scales .",
    "there are several means by which this ratio may be enhanced .",
    "one is to include the inner scale cut - off in the density spectrum , which reduces the power at small scales ( coles et al .",
    "1987 ) ; these authors proposed inner scales of @xmath20 m. , though this does not correspond to any obvious physical scale . physically",
    ", the inner scale corresponds to the scale at which the turbulent cascade dissipates and becomes a source of heating for the plasma ( spangler , 1991 ) .",
    "the value of the inner scale is largely unknown . using different methods , spangler & gwinn ( 1990 ) , kaspi & stinebring ( 1992 ) , and gupta et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have reported values for the inner scale ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 meters . in proposing the smaller values ,",
    "spangler & gwinn ( 1990 ) argued that the inner scale is the larger of the ion inertial length , @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the alfvn speed , and @xmath25 is the ion cyclotron frequency ) , and the ion larmor radius , @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the ion thermal speed ) ; they obtained parameters for the warm ionized medium in reasonable agreement with observations . in a recent discussion , minter & spangler ( 1997 )",
    "have suggested ion - neutral collisional damping and wave - packet steepening as possible dissipation mechanisms for the turbulence in the diffuse ionized gas , which would make the mean - free path for ion - neutral collisions a possible value for the inner scale .",
    "however , this is thought to be larger than the maximum values proposed to explain the observations , making it a less convincing dissipation mechanism .",
    "observationally , the kolmogorov model with a large inner scale predicts refractive modulation indices consistent with pulsar measurements ( gupta et al .",
    "it has also been proposed to explain the occasional periodic fringes , with an inner scale on the order of the fresnel scale ( cordes , pidwerbetsky , & lovelace 1986 ; goodman et al .",
    ". however , rickett et al .  (",
    "1997 ) reported a fringe event for the pulsar b0834 + 06 that could not be explained as the effect of a large inner - scale spectrum .",
    "the event requires similar conditions to those needed to explain the extreme scattering events ( fiedler et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "another way to enhance the ratio of the power between the refractive and diffractive scales in the spectrum is to steepen the spectrum  with spectral exponents @xmath28 ( blandford & narayan 1985 ; goodman & narayan 1985 ; romani , narayan , & blandford 1986 ) .",
    "while power - law spectra with @xmath29 11/3 have a turbulence connotation , spectra with @xmath30 might involve some forms of turbulence , but are also consistent with a distribution of non - turbulent structures with a range of spatial scales .",
    "such steep spectra with @xmath31 predict refractive modulation indices close to unity ( goodman & narayan 1985 ) , which is substantially larger than the range 30 to 40 % observed from the nearby pulsars . on this basis rickett & lyne ( 1990 ) and armstrong et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have rejected spectra steeper than 4 for the interstellar plasma .",
    "however , the special case of @xmath32 has been given little attention .",
    "we can conceive of a power - law model with spectral exponent @xmath32 given by : @xmath33 hereafter , we refer to this model as the `` @xmath32 model . ''",
    "blandford & narayan ( 1985 ) briefly discussed this special case without including a cut - off at low wavenumbers .",
    "it is interesting to note that even though the kolmogorov spectral exponent @xmath12 is very close to 4 , the @xmath32 model has a very different physical implication",
    ". its physical origin has been rarely discussed , and it has not been formally compared with observations .",
    "physically , this spectrum suggests the random distribution in location and orientation of discrete discontinuous objects across the line of sight .",
    "an `` outer '' scale , @xmath34 , is included to account for the typical size of such objects .",
    "the `` inner '' scale here would correspond to the scale of the sharpness of a typical discontinuity .",
    "we assume the `` inner '' scale to be smaller than the diffractive scale of scintillations , and hence has no significant effect on the scintillations .",
    "the @xmath32 model could characterize stellar wind boundaries , supernova shock fronts , sharp boundaries of hii regions at the strmgren radius , or any plasma `` cloud '' with sufficiently sharp boundaries ( transition regions shorter than the diffractive scintillation scale ) which may cross the line of sight .",
    "note that , though turbulence is not necessarily implied by the model , strong turbulence which has steepened to form shocks would also be described by the @xmath32 model . in these models a single discrete object crossing the line of sight could also explain the `` extreme scattering events '' observed in the flux density variations of extra - galactic sources ( e.g.  fiedler et al .",
    "we note that the analysis of such events have been primarily based on geometrical optics involving a single `` cloud '' ( goodman et al .",
    "1987 ; cordes et al .  1986 ; cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; roberts & ables 1982 ; ewing et al .  1970 ) .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath32 model includes the `` wave optics '' effects when the line of sight passes through very many such clouds .",
    "the ism is assumed to consist of a random assembly of discrete structures with abrupt density steps which may be independent of each other .",
    "if the @xmath32 model were compatible with all of the scintillation observations , it would remove the implication of interstellar plasma turbulence with an inertial range spanning as much as 10 orders of magnitude in scale , which has become the canonical model for iss phenomena .",
    "it would , however , still be consistent with turbulence that has steepened into shocks .",
    "we start with a simple derivation of the @xmath32 model in section [ sec : deriv ] . in section",
    "[ sec : structfn ] , we give equations for the wave structure function for the @xmath32 model and compare predictions in section [ sec : decbw ] , the variation of the diffractive decorrelation bandwidth with frequency is used to test the @xmath32 model against the simple kolmogorov model and the kolmogorov model with an inner - scale ( hereafter , the `` inner - scale '' model ) . in section",
    "[ sec : mr ] , the observed variation of the refractive scintillation index with the normalized diffractive decorrelation bandwidth is compared with theoretical predictions for the simple kolmogorov , inner - scale , and @xmath32 models .",
    "we use theoretical results from a previous paper ( lambert & rickett 1999 ; hereafter , lr99 ) , in which we developed the theory of diffractive scintillations in a medium modeled by these spectra , and we add details of the theory for refractive scintillation in appendix a. in appendix b , we discuss the use of the square of the second moment to approximate the intensity correlation function for diffractive scintillation with @xmath32 . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we give a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we give a simple derivation of the @xmath32 model .",
    "consider first a random distribution in space of identical plasma structures ( blobs ) .",
    "the resulting electron density may be described as the convolution of a three - dimensional poisson point process with the density profile of one individual blob .",
    "this is the spatial analog of shot noise , in which each charge carrier contributes the same temporal profile of current arriving at randomly distributed times . in the wavenumber domain , the power spectrum of the electron density",
    "is then given by the spectrum of the poisson point process multiplied by the squared magnitude of the fourier transform of one blob .",
    "the spectrum of the poisson point process is a constant equal to the number density , @xmath35 , of the blobs in space ( papoulis 1991 ) .",
    "thus the power spectrum of the medium follows the same shape as that of an individual blob .",
    "a similar description applies to water droplets in a fog and many naturally occurring media , as discussed by ratcliffe ( 1956 ) .",
    "if the blobs are asymmetrical and randomly oriented , one must also average the spectrum over the possible angles of orientation .",
    "the basic feature of structures with discontinuous boundaries is that their power spectrum has an asymptotic behavior at large wavenumbers that varies as ( wavenumber)@xmath36 . this is the spatial analog of the idea that the temporal spectrum of any pulse shape with an abrupt rise or fall has a high - frequency asymptote as ( frequency)@xmath37 .",
    "the prime example is a rectangular pulse , for which the spectrum is a sinc - squared function , whose high - frequency envelope follows this law .",
    "the simplest spatial example is spherical blobs of radius @xmath38 with uniform density @xmath39 inside and zero outside ; clearly , an added uniform background density does not affect the power spectrum .",
    "the three - dimensional spatial fourier transform of an _ isotropic function @xmath40 of radial distance @xmath41 is given by ( tatarskii 1961 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath2 is the magnitude of the wavenumber .",
    "for any function @xmath40 that falls to zero beyond a radius @xmath38 , the integral will vary as @xmath43 in the high - wavenumber limit @xmath44 , making @xmath45 . for the spherical blobs of size @xmath38",
    "we have : @xmath46 for the squared magnitude of the fourier transform , for very small and large values of @xmath47 : @xmath48 { \\displaystyle   q^{-4 } \\ ; a^2 f_0 ^ 2 /(8\\pi^4 ) \\ , \\mbox { , }   } & q a > > 1 \\ , \\mbox{. } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : magsqspherefourier } \\ ] ] the spectrum of the electron density is then @xmath49 .",
    "we can approximate this by equation ( [ eq : beta4 ] ) , which exactly matches equation ( [ eq : magsqspherefourier ] ) at small and large values of @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "_    there are evident generalizations to make the model more like a real medium .",
    "the spheres could have a probability distribution for their radii , which would weight the average of the square of equation ( [ eq : spherefourier ] ) .",
    "the spheres could have smoothly varying density inside and an abrupt boundary at radius @xmath38 .",
    "as with the pulse example , the high - wavenumber behavior would not change .",
    "more realistic models would include anisotropic structures with random orientations and a distribution of scales .",
    "for example , consider a circular cylinder as a model for an anisotropic blob , with a particular radius and thickness .",
    "its fourier transform can be computed with respect to its major axes .",
    "this can then be transformed to tilted axes and the result averaged over an isotropic distribution of angles of tilt . evidently the result will also be isotropic ; we have solved this approximately and find a spectrum with the same high - wavenumber _ asymptotic form as equation ( [ eq : beta4 ] ) , where the `` outer scale , '' @xmath53 , is the smaller of the thickness and radius .",
    "this result could be averaged over a probability distribution of radii and thicknesses and a similar conclusion reached , with @xmath53 as a weighted average of the smallest dimension .",
    "planar sheets at random angles are modeled as very flat cylinders and provide a crude representation of a distribution of shocks .",
    "another simplified model would be ellipsoids of different sizes , eccentricities , and orientations , and again we expect a similar result . _    we conclude that the @xmath32 spectrum is an approximate description of the power spectrum for a medium with a random distribution of discontinuous structures , in the limit for wavenumbers greater than the reciprocal of the smallest dimension across the structures .",
    "we note that for wavenumbers at or below about @xmath54 the functional form depends on the detailed shapes , though it will be much less steep than @xmath55 .",
    "thus equation ( [ eq : beta4 ] ) will not be generally applicable at the lowest wavenumbers .",
    "similarly , in practice there is a finite scale over which the density jump occurs ( e.g.  shock thickness ) .",
    "this can be modeled by convolving the idealized discontinuous structures with a suitable narrow , say , gaussian function which thus provides a very high - wavenumber cut - off beyond which the spectrum falls rapidly to zero .",
    "consequently , we consider a spectrum with an inverse fourth power law between inner and outer scales , though these do not have the same connotations as inner and outer scales in a turbulent cascade .",
    "we do not discuss the physical origin of the supposed discontinuous plasma structures beyond the ideas formulated in the introduction , such as supernova shock fronts , stellar wind boundaries or sharp boundaries of hii regions at the strmgren radius .",
    "there needs to be no physical coupling between the individual blob structures , and there is no turbulent cascade implied by the @xmath32 spectrum .",
    "however , we note that shocks developing from the steepening of very strong turbulence could also be described by the model , and so if successful , the model would not rule out such strong turbulence , though in this case the @xmath32 range does not correspond to an inertial cascade as does the 11/3 spectrum .    in the following sections , we give the necessary scintillation theory needed to develop equations for the scintillation observables corresponding to the @xmath32 model , which we then compare with iss observations .",
    "we concentrate on measurements which are sensitive to the form of the density spectrum and are relatively insensitive to the distribution of scattering material along the line of sight .",
    "central to the description of the second moment and the coherence function for intensity is the phase structure function .",
    "the longitudinal gradient of the phase structure function is related to the electron density spectrum through ( cf .",
    "coles et al .   1987 ) : @xmath56 \\kappa d\\kappa \\ , \\mbox{. }",
    "\\label{eq : long_grad_phase_strucfunc } \\ ] ] here @xmath57 is the speed of light , @xmath58 is the classical electron radius , and @xmath59 is the radio frequency . for a plane wave incident on a scattering medium , the line of sight integral of @xmath60 gives the structure function of the geometric optics phase , also called the _ wave _ structure function , @xmath61 .",
    "for the spherical wave geometry applicable to a pulsar at distance @xmath62 , the separation @xmath63 at the observer s plane is projected back to the point of integration , giving @xmath64 .",
    "the integrals are evaluated explicitly in equations ( 13 ) , ( 17 ) , and ( 21 ) of lr99 for a uniform scattering medium with the simple power - law , inner - scale , and @xmath32 spectral models , respectively . in the extended scattering geometry ,",
    "the field coherence length at the observer , @xmath65 , is defined by : @xmath66 . for a screen of thickness @xmath67 at distance @xmath68 from the pulsar ,",
    "the wave structure function at the observer becomes @xmath69 , which has an explicit dependence on the screen location . in lr99",
    ", we found it useful to define a coherence scale @xmath70 for the screen by its phase structure function @xmath71 , which is independent of the screen location . note that in applying equation ( [ eq : long_grad_phase_strucfunc ] ) , we are assuming that the screen thickness , @xmath67 , is much greater than the outer scale @xmath53 and small compared to total distance @xmath62 .    here",
    ", we repeat the equation for the phase structure function of the @xmath32 model in a thin layer ( screen ) . substituting the @xmath32 model for the density spectrum into equation ( [ eq : long_grad_phase_strucfunc ] ) , integrating , and multiplying by the screen thickness , @xmath67",

    "the detailed shape , near where the structure function flattens , is governed by the shape of the low - frequency turnover in our model spectrum , equation ( [ eq : beta4 ] ) ; however , as noted above , the turnover shape depends on details of the density profiles in the plasma blobs which are not constrained in our density model .",
    "the logarithmic structure function for the @xmath32 model has far - reaching consequences .",
    "as the outer scale becomes larger , the structure function approaches a square - law .",
    "however , due to the presence of the logarithm , this occurs only slowly ; that is , only at the limit as @xmath63 goes to zero does the @xmath32 model structure function become exactly square - law . a square - law structure function for the medium",
    "is a convenient mathematical model , but as noted in lr99 , in a real medium the structure function must eventually saturate at very large separations .",
    "nevertheless , the square - law structure function has been widely used since it provides a valid approximation for scales smaller than the reciprocal of the wavenumber at which the spectrum is cut - off . the fact that the @xmath32 model structure function deviates from a pure square - law , even for very large values of the outer scale , makes this model interesting and an independent investigation worthwhile .    in figure",
    "[ fig : slope ] , we have plotted the structure function of the @xmath32 model and its effective local logarithmic slope , @xmath76 , versus the transverse spatial lag , @xmath63 , for various values of the outer scale , @xmath53 ( see equation 20 of lr99 ) . to illustrate the shapes , we have chosen @xmath77  km for all curves .",
    "the thin dashed lines correspond to the simple kolmogorov model with logarithmic slope of 5/3 , and the thin dotted lines correspond to the square - law structure function .",
    "the plot shows how slowly the local slope approaches 2 ; even for @xmath78 , the slope is 1.95distinctly less than 2 .",
    "the points in the upper panel correspond to measured local exponent of the wave structure function obtained from vlbi observations , as tabulated by spangler & gwinn ( 1990 ) . in principle , this method of comparison provides a good test for the form of the density spectrum .",
    "these authors presented a similar plot corresponding to the inner - scale model , for which @xmath76 is close to 2.0 for @xmath63 less than the inner scale and close to 5/3 for @xmath63 greater than the inner scale , with a transition occurring over about a decade in @xmath63 .",
    "they derived estimates of the inner scale ranging from 50,000 to 200,000  meters , for the highly scattered sources that they studied . whereas there is some uncertainty in some of the estimates of @xmath79",
    ", there are several examples in which values greater than 5/3 are reliably observed ( e.g.  trotter et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "as can be seen , there is also reasonable agreement with the @xmath32 model . assuming the model to be correct , a separate model - fitting to each observation yields an outer scale in the range @xmath80 to @xmath81  meters .",
    "these values are much smaller than the parsec scales of supernova remnants and interstellar clouds .",
    "however based on this comparison alone , we are unable to discriminate between the inner - scale and @xmath32 models since they both provide equally satisfactory agreement with the observations",
    ". hence further independent tests are needed , and in the following sections , we present comparisons with two other scintillation observables which in the end argue against the @xmath32 model as a universal description of the ionized ism .",
    "the diffractive decorrelation bandwidth , @xmath82 , is perhaps the easiest iss observable to measure .",
    "it is the frequency - difference for a decorrelation to 50% of the correlation function for diffractive intensity scintillations .",
    "these are usually recorded as a dynamic spectrum centered on a given radio frequency , @xmath59 , for a pulsar .",
    "observations of @xmath82 for one pulsar at a wide range of radio frequencies have provided an important test of power - law models for the interstellar density spectrum on that particular line of sight .",
    "when the diffractive scale is far from the inner and outer scales , one expects @xmath83 , which for the simple kolmogorov model is @xmath84 , in both screen and extended medium geometries . in this section",
    "we re - examine the published measurements and compare them with theory for the three different spectral models .",
    "since the scaling laws are all so steep , in figures [ fig : vela ] and [ fig : other ] , we have plotted the observations logarithmically as @xmath85 .",

    "the conversion of an estimate of a pulse broadening time to a decorrelation bandwidth relies on the uncertainty relation @xmath91 .",
    "unfortunately , the `` constant '' @xmath92 takes on different values for different geometries and spectral models . for the @xmath32 model ,",
    "it is also very weakly dependent on frequency . in table 1 of lr99",
    ", we gave numerical values for @xmath92 for the three spectral models with spherical waves in both a screen and an extended medium geometry .",

    "we display the predictions for extended medium and note that the screen values are only about 20% less for each spectrum .",
    "thus in comparing data with the theory for the @xmath0 and inner - scale models , the data should lie between the extremes of the open and solid stars , depending on the outer and inner scales , respectively .",
    "note that the value of @xmath92 in equation ( 7 ) of the taylor et al .",
    "( 1993 ) catalog is more than 50% greater than values computed by lr99 , since it concerns the mean pulse delay rather than the 1/e decay time of the pulse .    the second correction to the data concerns the effects of refractive scintillation at the higher radio frequencies , which are closer to the transition to weak scintillation .",

    "the open circles and their error bars provide the best direct estimates of @xmath82 and the indirect estimates lie between the open and solid stars .",
    "the theory of diffractive scintillations has been discussed by many authors ; we will use the results of section 6 in lr99 for a point source ( spherical waves ) either in an extended scattering medium or with a screen at @xmath68 from the pulsar and @xmath93 from the observer ( with @xmath94 ) . following usual practice , we assume the strong scattering limit , in which the frequency decorrelation function for intensity is the squared magnitude of the diffractive component of the two - frequency second moment of the field .",

    "it appears that even if the scattering medium is not uniform on scales of a few kpc , there is not a single region that dominates the scattering .",
    "computations of @xmath119 due to a patchy distribution along the line of sight could test what distribution would start to approximate the uniformly extended medium .",
    "turning to a comparison with the alternative inner - scale spectrum in figure [ fig : mrin ] , the 100  mhz observations could be explained by very large values of @xmath104 ( @xmath159 m to @xmath121 m ) in a screen configuration or by more modest , but still large , values of @xmath104 ( @xmath81 m ) in an extended medium .",
    "the latter was essentially the proposal made by coles et al .",
    "( 1987 ) for the nearby lines of sight .",

    "for an inner scale spectrum in a screen , large values of @xmath104 ( @xmath81 m to @xmath159 m ) would be necessary ; and in an extended medium 60% of the points lie near the simple kolmogorov model , with the rest requiring inner scale values ( @xmath123 m to @xmath81 m ) .",
    "the 610 mhz data in our analysis come from riss observations of 21 pulsars made by stinebring and are described in more detail by smirnova et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who also compare the results with various models for the spectrum and spatial distribution of the electron density .",
    "they note that 4 pulsars which are seen through known hii regions or supernovae remnants show relatively elevated values for @xmath119 , and find 3 other pulsars with similar behavior .",
    "these are the points which lie above the kolmogorov line in figure [ fig : mrin]b .",
    "their interpretation is that for these objects the scattering is concentrated into regions either near the pulsar or near the earth , and that these regions are characterized by an inner scale near @xmath160 m .",
    "their spectrum model is very similar to our inner - scale model , except that the cut - off is characterized by a steep power - law rather than by an exponential function .",
    "we find a somewhat larger numerical value for the inner scale required to match those objects .",
    "we also note that the theoretical @xmath119 values are consistently higher for an extended medium , and so require a more modest inner scale .",
    "however , an important result of our analysis is an alternative explanation for the relatively high @xmath119 values seen for some pulsars .",
    "we suggest that pulsar lines of sight can pass through discrete clouds with increased plasma density on large scales , that steepen the low - wavenumber spectrum as opposed to cutting off the high - wavenumbers . a discontinuity spectrum ( @xmath32 )",
    "is one way that the spectrum can be steepened , but smoother structures on scales larger than @xmath121 m ( @xmath161 au ) would also boost the low - wavenumbers and could cause similar enhancements of refractive compared to diffractive scintillations .",
    "such enhancements are likely to be associated with hii regions or supernova remnants .",
    "a similar idea was also discussed by lestrade , rickett , & cognard ( 1998 ) in the context of extreme scattering events in pulsar timing measurements .",
    "to take this idea further , a composite between the kolmogorov and the @xmath32 or steeper spectra should be investigated , particularly one in which the line of sight is not uniformly weighted .",
    "smirnova et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also note that the strength of scattering increases very much faster with distance and dispersion measure than if the medium were statistically uniform .",
    "the distant pulsars in their sample are mostly observed at low galactic latitudes and so are subject to the enhanced density and turbulence described by the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model .",
    "it appears that most distant pulsars follow the uniform extended kolmogorov model with inner scale smaller than @xmath162 m .",
    "thus although these lines of sight are subject to enhanced scattering in the inner galactic plane , the spectrum effectively follows the kolmogorov law and the plasma is dispersed enough to approximate a uniform scattering medium .",
    "there are presumably discrete refracting structures present along these lines of sight , but their contribution to the density spectrum is masked by the higher densities of the inner galaxy , which still follow an apparently turbulent spectral form .",

    "the filter term was discussed by lr99 and shown to be important only as the strength of scattering decreases .",
    "it is the last two terms in @xmath245 that determine the zero - order result , so we looked at the effect of the higher order terms .",

    "this comes from the integral of the cross - spectrum .",
    "equations ( 31 ) through ( 34 ) of ccffh give the zero and first order terms of the cross spectrum in terms of the spectrum of refractive index fluctuations in the layer .",
    "for the @xmath32 spectrum we reduced these to a sum of confluent hypergeometric functions , which can be explicitly computed . for a sample observing condition we found that the higher order terms for the cross - spectrum itself were significant compared to the zero - order term",
    "; however when integrated to give intensity cross - correlation , they only had a minor effect on the decorrelation bandwidth itself ( @xmath282% increase ) .",
    "the reason for this appears to be the dominant effect of the last two terms in the @xmath245 summation with unequal frequencies .",
    "to summarize we find a modest ( logarithmic ) increase in the diffractive scale relative to the field coherence scale @xmath65 , but that this remains less than a factor of 1.7 for the likely iss parameters .",
    "this is accompanied by a smaller increase in the decorrelation bandwidth relative to the calculations of lr99 , which relied on the normal zero - order expansion at high wavenumbers .",

    "<S> an `` outer scale '' is included in the model representing the typical scale over which the density of the medium remains uniform . </S>",
    "<S> such a spectrum could be used to model plasma shock fronts in supernova remnants or other plasma discontinuities . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate and develop equations for the decorrelation bandwidth of diffractive scintillations and the refractive scintillation index and compare our results with pulsar measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both a medium concentrated in a thin layer and an extended irregular medium . we conclude that the @xmath0 model gives satisfactory agreement for many diffractive measurements , in particular the vlbi meaurements of the structure function exponent between 5/3 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it gives less satisfactory agreement for the refractive scintillation index than does the kolmogorov turbulence spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison suggests that the medium consists of a pervasive background distribution of turbulence embedded with randomly placed discrete plasma structures such as shocks or hii regions . </S>",
    "<S> this can be modeled by a composite spectrum following the kolmogorov form at high wavenumbers and steepening at lower wavenumbers corresponding to the typical ( inverse ) size of the discrete structures . </S>",
    "<S> such a model can also explain the extreme scattering events . </S>",
    "<S> however , lines of sight through the enhanced scattering prevalent at low galactic latitudes are accurately described by the kolmogorov spectrum in an extended medium and do not appear to have a similar low - wavenumber steepening . </S>"
