    "in an attempt to understand better the quasi - satellite phenomenon @xcite we tested what would happen if the force between two co - orbital bodies were different from the normal newtonian gravity .",
    "we found that many forces can produce similar relative motion of the bodies .",
    "even repulsive forces result in tandem motion of the bodies . at that point",
    "it became clear that constant weak repulsive force could be used to keep artificial satellites flying near each other .",
    "this paper studies that phenomenon mainly numerically but we also present some simple analytical considerations .    in quasi satellite motion an asteroid moves around the sun co - orbitally with a planet and remains near the planet such that in the rotating coordinate system it looks like moving around the planet in a retrograde orbit . in that system",
    "the mutual force of the bodies is attractive .",
    "on the other hand it is well known that a spacecraft chasing a satellite in the same orbit must brake to catch it up .",
    "thus , somewhat counter intuitively , tandem flight of two satellites moving around a central body in its gravitational field seems to be possible both with attractive or repulsive mutual acceleration . in the case of two satellites",
    "the force between the satellites can been mimicked using ion thrusters .",
    "both an attractive force @xmath1 and repulsive constant force produce similar effects , which may look somewhat unexpected . above @xmath2",
    "means the distance of the satellites which we assume to be quite small compared with the size of the orbit .",
    "we restrict our consideration to low eccentricity orbits .",
    "high eccentricity orbits are generally more complicated for formation flying @xcite .",
    "the simplest of all methods to make satellites to fly in tandem is to put them into precisely same orbit to some distance from each other .",
    "an example of such a real system is nasa s grail mission in which two spacecrafts are flying in tandem orbits around the moon to measure its gravity field in detail .",
    "this works perfectly as long as one can consider the gravitational field to be rotationally symmetrical ( like the earth s field modeled without tesseral harmonics ) in which case the distance between the satellites varies only due to eccentricity caused speed differences .",
    "the simplest way to achieve tandem flight in that situation is possibly making ion thrusters to point towards , or away from , the other satellite(s ) and this seems to work according to our simulations .",
    "one can keep the satellites to move in the same fashion as the natural quasi - satellites .",
    "even near triangle configuration for three satellites is possible without any complicated control , just constant acceleration or an acceleration that depends on the distance of the satellites .",
    "no other information is necessary but the relative directions ( and distances if the acceleration needs to depend on the distance ) .",
    "long lasting thrusters are necessary , but such exist as shown e.g. by esa s smart-1 mission from a near earth orbit to the moon . the very basic method to consider satellite relative motions near each",
    "other and/or rendezvous is naturally the clohessy - wiltshire equations @xcite . to get satellites flying in tandem has been considered in numerous publications e.g.",
    "precise orbital elements adjustments have been discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the formation flight using differential approximations of the pure kepler motion , also @xcite discuss the computation of relative motion using simple methods .",
    "@xcite discuss formation flight in highly eccentric orbits using differential mean orbital elements as design variables and the @xcite state transition matrix for relative motion propagation .",
    "use of a coordinate transformation was consider by @xcite .",
    "we first consider the problem in terms of a simple approximate analytical theory .",
    "the assumptions in that theory are based on simulation results since a complete analytical solution seems laborious .",
    "after the analytical considerations we present results from numerical simulation .",
    "the gravity field that we used in the tests was the spherical function expansion , following @xcite , plus luni - solar terms , but we also studied the simple @xmath3 field model .",
    "the ion thruster effects we model using different model potentials could be engineered with adjustable thrusts",
    ". however , the constant force model is the simplest one and it seems to work .",
    "finally we remark that this is not an engineering paper , we just study the dynamics .",
    "we choose the units such that @xmath4 where @xmath5=the gravitational constant , @xmath6=radius of the earth ( actually 6378.137  km ) and @xmath7= the mass of the earth .",
    "the unit of time becomes such that the formal period of a satellite with semi - major - axis @xmath8 would be @xmath9 . in this system one time unit in seconds is @xmath10  sec and the length of a day is @xmath11 . despite these choices we write in some formulae the radius of the earth and its mass explicitly visible . in illustration , to make them easier to understand , we use also other units , e.g. kilometers .    for orbital elements we use the standard notations @xmath12 which are the semi - major axis , eccentricity , inclination , argument of perihelion , longitude of the ascending node and the mean anomaly , respectively .",
    "for the position vector we use @xmath13 and for velocity @xmath14 . in the used units",
    "the velocity and momentum are the same i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "the semi - major - axes of the satellites are only very slightly different ( and equal on the average ) and therefore we can in most consideration take them to be practically same although the difference @xmath16 has an important role in some analytical considerations .",
    "we need also the difference of the mean longitudes @xmath17 .",
    "we consider ( almost ) coplanar orbits which means that @xmath18 to high precision and therefore the difference of @xmath19 s is essentially the same as the difference of the angles @xmath20 .",
    "this quantity is one of the most important ones in our analytical consideration of the stability of the tandem flight .",
    "we use for it the notation @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the mean motions .",
    "an other important quantity is the eccentricity vector @xmath23 and especially their difference @xmath24 which is a kind of relative eccentricity vector .",
    "@xcite presented a theory of satellite rendezvous ( c - w hereafter ) .",
    "this theory used the variational equations of the two - body problem @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the variation of the position and @xmath27 is the variation of velocity . for a circular orbit in the rotating coordinate system , where @xmath13 is constant , the equations become linear and easily solvable .",
    "much earlier hill had studied the lunar orbit in a somewhat similar way @xcite .",
    "the difference in these treatments is that in the latter one there are additional nonlinear terms in the equations ( [ cw - eq ] ) of motion . as shown e.g. by @xcite the c - w - solution and in fact a somewhat more general one",
    "can be obtained by differentiating the two - body equations with respect to the orbital elements .",
    "let @xmath28 be a set of elements e.g. @xmath29 which are the mean anomaly @xmath30 at epoch , inclination , ascending node , argument of pericentre , semi - major - axis and eccentricity , respectively .",
    "the solution for the variational equation takes the form @xmath31 the constants @xmath32 represent the element variations .",
    "a particular solution of equation  ( [ variaatio ] ) is @xmath33 which is related to the variation of the semi - major - axis .",
    "because the time @xmath34 appears as a factor of @xmath14 it is clear that without some regulating additional force the distance between the bodies would increase continuously unless the semi - major - axis difference is precisely zero .",
    "additional information about the stability of the hill - type and distant retrograde orbits can also be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .        here",
    "we present some numerically obtained facts that can be used as assumptions in our analytical considerations .",
    "the force model we used consisted earth potential model with the @xmath3 terms and a weak ion thruster acceleration that was either a repulsive constant acceleration or , for comparison , an attraction that had the @xmath35 distance dependence .",
    "also other models were briefly consider ( see below ) .",
    "the following was found to be true in our simulations :    -the orbital elements vary periodically but their mean values remain the same and the @xmath3 ( and higher order ) effects have minor influence in the relative motion of the satellites ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "-inclinations @xmath36 and longitudes of ascending node @xmath37 remain very close to each other if they are so initially .",
    "this is due to similar precession rates .",
    "thus the satellites remain almost co - planar . also the @xmath38 s precess at the same rate .",
    "-the difference of the eccentricity vectors @xmath39 remains almost constant in length .",
    "this is important in the theory and in accordance with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "see fig.[eeekuva ] in this paper .",
    "-when the initial semi - major - axes are nearly the same they remain so as long as the satellites fly in tandem . due to the thruster effect the values",
    "fluctuate such that the mean angular speeds remain the same .",
    "thus in an approximate theory we can take the ( mean ) semi - major - axes to be the same , only their difference varies periodically .",
    "those observations can be used as assumptions in the next section where the analytical treatment is discussed .      consider first a simple case in which we assume the motions to be pure two - body motions and of low eccentricity .",
    "further we assume the motions to be co - planar .    as a first simple example we consider the case in which one of the orbits is circular and the other one has a small eccentricity . in the rotating",
    "coordinate system in which the circular orbit satellites coordinates are simply @xmath40 when the distance is consider to be the @xmath41-coordinate , the eccentric orbit has approximately the coordinates @xmath42 when eccentricity and @xmath43 are consider to be quantities of the same order of magnitude ( we call this order @xmath44 ) and so small that the linearized approximation is valid .    , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the coordinate system that rotates with one of the satellites(=the central dot = satellite  1 ) . here",
    "the eccentricity of satellite 2 is @xmath47 , while the satellite 1 has eccentricity 0 .",
    "the distances were converted to kilometers assuming that @xmath48 km .",
    "[ kuva1],title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=177 ]    the differences of the coordinates of the satellites are thus @xmath49 from which we see that the relative motion is mainly caused by the eccentricity as long as the mean longitude difference @xmath43 remains small .",
    "the effect of @xmath43 is illustrated in fig.[kuva1 ] . from the above",
    "coordinate differences we have for the distance between the satellites the form @xmath50 the generalization of this to the case of two eccentric orbits is quite simple ( see below ) .    for stable tandem flights it is clearly necessary that the mean longitude difference @xmath43 indeed remains small .",
    "this is what we study now .",
    "if both satellites are supposed to use the ion thrusters with equal accelerations , it is possible to model the system mathematically in terms of a hamiltonian    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 s are the perturbing force functions with high order spherical harmonics , including tesseral ones and the rotation of the earth , were included .",
    "the force function for both satellites was @xmath54 here @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the longitude , read eastwards , in the earth fixed coordinates , @xmath34 is time , @xmath57 is earths rotational frequency , @xmath58 initial phase , while @xmath59 defines the order up to which terms are taken into account ( we used @xmath60 , like @xcite ) . the numerical coefficients",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 define the gravitational potential .",
    "@xmath63 s are the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the term @xmath64 naturally signifies the effect due to the sun and moon ( ls = luni - solar ) .",
    "if we include only the leading term , the @xmath3 term , then @xmath65 are the @xmath3 terms ( @xmath66 in this notation ) .",
    "the ` perturbing ' thruster acceleration is in the term @xmath67 ( which thus depends only on @xmath2 ) , where @xmath68 the secular ( averaged over one period ) form of the @xmath69 hamiltonians in the @xmath3 approximation are @xmath70 the perturbing function @xmath71 tells how the thrusters are used .",
    "for example if constant acceleration is used , then @xmath72 where the constant @xmath73 is the satellites acceleration due to the ion thruster .",
    "we assume this to be constant ( unless otherwise indicated ) .",
    "following @xcite for co - planar orbits one can derive the approximation @xmath74 where @xmath75 thus this more general approximation differs from the simple equation ( [ simpled ] ) only in the way that the eccentricity is replaced by the ` relative eccentricity ' @xmath76 and the angle @xmath77 differs from @xmath30 by a constant ( of two - body motion ) .",
    "the secular perturbing function for the two - satellite motion is @xmath78    the usual lagrange equations for the orbital elements @xmath79 and mean anomaly @xmath80 can be written in the form @xmath81 since the semi - major - axes @xmath82 and @xmath83 are equal on the average , we write @xmath84 for this average , and @xmath85 for the corresponding mean motion .",
    "the derivative of @xmath43 reads @xmath86 due to the smallness ( @xmath87 ) and similarity ( @xmath88 ) of the perturbations the main term in the equation for @xmath89 can be taken as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and because of the expression ( above ) for @xmath92 and the fact that @xmath30 is present only in @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 in which the last equality follows from the fact that @xmath95 .",
    "note that the inclusion of the @xmath96-term is due to our assumption that both satellites have a thruster . at this point",
    "one sees that the @xmath3 term has no effect in the motion of @xmath43 .",
    "however it has a small indirect effect because the orbits are not keplerian and the secular theory is not accurate enough .",
    "these facts are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kuva2 ] in which one can see the effect of @xmath3 as compared with the pure two - body motion . in these experiments",
    "the thrusters perturbed the satellite motions in the same way .",
    "in addition we really have the term @xmath97 , but here the terms nearly cancel each other and they are very small = @xmath98 , so that the equation ( [ tupladot ] ) is a good approximation .",
    "the secular perturbation due to the thruster effect can now be obtained by averaging @xmath2 over the angle @xmath77 as @xmath99 as said above , for constant mutual force @xmath100 . due to the structure of the expression for @xmath101",
    "it is clear that @xmath102 is an even function of @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath103 averaging over the angle @xmath77 in eq.([deltamato ] ) and expanding in powers of @xmath43 one gets the secular approximation @xmath104 these equations are naturally valid only to second order in @xmath43 since that is the case for eq.([deltamato ] ) . for the equation of @xmath43-motion we have @xmath105 which shows that the @xmath43-motion is harmonic oscillation in this approximation . in fig .",
    "[ theta.periods ] the periods are compared for the different models ( using eq.([usarja ] ) , the @xmath3 only model and pure two - body motion ) and the results are quite close to each other , with only a few percent differences . thus one may conclude that the @xmath100 perturbation mainly determines the motion of the mean longitude difference @xmath43 .",
    "in general it is interesting to consider the effect of different kinds of mutual interactions . for a general power @xmath106 of the distance one may write the average of @xmath107 as @xmath108    the sign of the second derivative of @xmath102 , with respect to @xmath43 ,",
    "tells if the mean longitude difference @xmath43 can stay small .",
    "in fact is turned out , somewhat unexpectedly , that the second derivative is a positive number for all nonzero powers @xmath106 , positive or negative .",
    "this result is illustrated in fig.[ddthn ] .",
    "thus the tandem flight seems possible with any mutual acceleration of the satellites if the force is derivable from a potential of the form @xmath109 for ( @xmath110 ) where @xmath111 . in passing we",
    "mention that the perturbing function can in general be anything of the form @xmath112 , which may be a finite , or at least convergent , expression still giving positive second derivative [ @xmath113 in ( [ rexpansion ] ) ] at @xmath46 .",
    "this happens at least if the coefficients @xmath114 are non negative .",
    "in this section we first discuss the results with two - satellite experiments and later this is extended to three satellites moving essentially in a ( flattened ) triangle configuration .",
    "our numerical experiments confirm clearly the main point of the theory part : the mean longitude difference @xmath43 fluctuates around zero and remains small .",
    "the amplitude depends on the difference in the initial values of the semi - major - axis , but the effect of the thruster makes this difference fluctuate around zero according to the equation ( [ thetaeqs ] ) and so the mean values are same . due to the fact that the two orbits are very similar , all the perturbations in them are similar and do not affect noticeably the relative motion of the satellites .",
    "the initial values in the numerical experiments were produced using two - body formulae .",
    "we set initially the inclinations @xmath115 and longitudes of ascending nodes @xmath37 to same value for the satellites . for the semi - major - axes we used typically one kilometer difference in the initial axis value .",
    "the initial eccentricities were set to the values of @xmath116 .",
    "the differences in the initial positions of the satellites were obtained by adding @xmath117 to the value of @xmath38 and subtracting that amount from the mean anomaly @xmath30 . for the experiments with three satellites we used @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) @xmath38 differences and removed an equal amount from @xmath30 .",
    "these operations made the mean longitudes equal in the beginning .       in two models : with the entire earth potential and with @xmath3-term only .",

    "one sees that it is positive for all non - zero powers @xmath106 , thus predicting possibility for stable motion near each other.[ddthn][kuva7 ] , width=302,height=170 ]    the approximate analytical theory suggest that to study the relative motion of the satellites and the correctness of the theory , it is enough to select some small eccentricity and a small thruster power . scaling for other values is easy using the theory . in this section we present some results of numerical experiments and",
    "display them graphically .",
    "we used for eccentricity the value @xmath125 and initial semi - major - axis difference of @xmath126 km .",
    "the size of the radial oscillation is about @xmath127 as one derives from the two - body motion and the along - orbit motion is twice this in the coordinate system in which one of the satellites is in the origin and the coordinate system rotates with that satellite .    in fig.([kuva2 ] ) we compare the oscillations of the @xmath43 angle in a system with all the earth potential term [ eq.([usarja ] ) ] with the model that includes only the @xmath3-term .",
    "the time span shown in the figure corresponds approximately to 1.5 months in the end of a total interval of nearly 2.6 years .",
    "we see that the @xmath43 motion is still very similar in both models after this long integration .",
    "thus the effect of the potential terms higher than @xmath3 seems minor at least in the @xmath43 angle .",
    "figure ( [ kuva3 ] ) we compare the @xmath43 motion in the full earth potential and pure two - body motion for about three moths .",
    "there is clear difference in amplitude and also a phase difference . due to the similarity of the motions",
    "one may conclude that these differences are mainly due to the @xmath3 term that makes the energy values of the satellites different and the initial derivative values , as computed using the two - body formulae , somewhat erroneous . in any case the differences are not very large and thus the two - body motion based estimates remain qualitatively correct .",
    "the fig.([kuva4 ] ) compares @xmath43 behavior for a shorter time in the two models as above with the analytical results following from the eq.([thetaeqs ] ) .",
    "one can see that the analytical approximation predicts the period with a few percent accuracy .",
    "one concludes that the analytical estimates , although based only on the keplerian motion formulae , are useful approximations .",
    "the difference in the relative motion curves in the full perturbation and the two - body model are compared in fig.([kuva5 ] ) .",
    "again the differences remain acceptably small .    in the theory",
    "the relative eccentricity @xmath122 is an important quantity . in fig.([kuva6 ] ) we demonstrate that this quantity is almost constant all the time although the individual eccentricities in the satellite orbits vary considerably .",
    "this result is the same what was observed long ago in quasi - satellite orbits @xcite .",
    "this numerical result is quite complicated to prove analytically and we ignore such considerations .",
    "we computed the second derivative of @xmath128 with respect to @xmath43 for different powers @xmath106 .",
    "the result is that this quantity is positive for any value of @xmath106 , positive or negative .",
    "thus one may conclude that any mutual force between the satellites that are derivable from a power - potential could result into stable quasi - satellite like motion .",
    "in fact there are many other such forces since at least any sum of power - potentials with positive coefficients would do here . in practice , however , the simple constant force is probably the most useful for real satellites .",
    "the only interesting point here is that in the case of real world quasi - satellite motion the force is @xmath129 ( plus the indirect term which has only a small effect ) .",
    "thus the dynamics with mutual forces , derivable from any power potential , has similar features .     of the size of the system .",
    "the colors show the identity of the satellites and size of dots go from small to bigger according to time .",
    "[ threesats][kuva12],width=321,height=302 ]    in figures ( [ kuva8 ] )  ( [ kuva11 ] ) the relative motions of the satellites are illustrated by plotting it at every maximum of @xmath130 for one period around the earth .",

    "these operations did not have any noticeable effect .",
    "the result was that the satellites move in a kind of triangle configuration .",
    "actually the orbits with respect to the center of the triple are approximately ellipses , but if the scale of the variation of the distance from the earth is scaled by a factor of @xmath136 the configuration looks like a circle .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kuva12 ] where the smaller dots represent the situation in the beginning and the larger ones show it after about 2.6 years .",
    "very similar results were obtained also with more satellites , for example systems of six satellites seems to behave in a similar way .",
    "thus it seems possible to keep a cluster of satellites close to each other just by using constant repulsive forces .",
    "this is probably simpler and other thinkable ways for formation flight of satellites .",
    "however this method just provides a way to keep satellites in a kind of elliptic like configuration .",
    "the motions of the satellites in low earth orbits are essentially just elliptic motions so that the relative motions are due to differences in two - body motion .",
    "our numerical experiments demonstrate that the tandem flight has the effect that the perturbations from the earth harmonics , which are orders of magnitude larger than the needed thruster force , affect the motions of the satellites in the same way and do not make much difference in their relative motion .",
    "this was also confirmed to be the case when high order expansion for the earth gravitational potential ( equation ( [ usarja ] ) ) is used . in other words",
    "the relative motion of satellites is mainly due to eccentricities so that in the orbital coordinate system they seem to move approximately along a small ellipse in which the axis ratio is @xmath137 .",
    "the only thing the thrusters must do is to keep the mean longitudes nearly same . for this purpose",
    "very small thrusts are enough when the orbits of the satellites are close to each other .",
    "little differences in the orbits are , however , not important as we found with simulations .        in our experiments , with the constant acceleration model , the value of relative acceleration of order @xmath138 [ g = the standard gravity value ( @xmath139 ) ] is enough .",
    "writing this in physical units we can say that @xmath140 is enough , but even smaller values may do . only if the initial difference in semi - major - axis is more than a kilometer or so",
    ", a somewhat stronger force is required , but even in such cases the forces needed are surprisingly small . in any case , the required acceleration is easy to find by numerical simulations . the experiments with the high order expansions , which contains the relevant perturbations for the satellite motion , leads to same results as the ones with only the @xmath3 term , at least within the precision of our illustrations .",
    "this result suggests that the relative motion under the action of the thruster force is not sensitive to perturbations .",
    "as mentioned in section [ threesat ] , even somewhat randomized directions of the thruster force does not have an effect in the relative motion of the satellites ."

    "<S> the quasi - satellite ( qs ) phenomenon makes two celestial bodies to fly near each other @xcite and that effect can be used also to make artificial satellites move in tandem . </S>",
    "<S> we consider formation flight of two or three satellites in low eccentricity near earth orbits . with the help of weak ion thrusters it is possible to accomplish tandem flight . with ion thrusters </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to mimic many kinds of mutual force laws between the satellites . </S>",
    "<S> we found that both a constant repulsive force or an attractive force that decreases with the distance are able to preserve the formation in which the eccentricities cause the actual relative motion and the weak thrusters keep the mean longitude difference small . </S>",
    "<S> initial values are important for the formation flight but very exact adjustment of orbital elements is not important . </S>",
    "<S> simplicity is one of our goals in this study and this result is achieved at least in the way that , when constant force thrusters are used , the satellites only need to detect the directions of the other ones to fly in tandem . </S>",
    "<S> a repulsive acceleration of the order of @xmath0 times the earth attraction , is enough to effectively eliminate the disruptive effects of all the perturbations at least for a timescale of years .    </S>",
