    ", one can study the phase structure of the gauge theory at strong coupling  @xcite . using the duality in the opposite direction",
    ", we can study the detail of the stringy correction to the gregory - laflamme transition with the monte - carlo simulation of the gauge theory . at present , it is difficult to study the maximally supersymmetric 2d sym by using the monte - carlo simulation .",
    "however , four - supercharge system has been studied extensively by using the formulations free from fine tuning .    in this paper , we study two - dimensional @xmath0 @xmath1 sym on two - torus using sugino s lattice regularization  @xcite . in this model , the restoration of supersymmetry without fine - tuning has been tested extensively @xcite .",

    "there are several motivations to study this system .",
    "firstly , it is the simplest sym in two dimensions which can be studied nonperturbatively by lattice simulation . especially , notorious `` sign problem '' is absent .",
    "secondly , we can expect that it is qualitatively similar to maximally supersymmetric ( @xmath34 ) sym , which is conjectured to be dual to type ii superstring .",
    "thirdly , its bosonic cousin is studied in  @xcite and it is interesting to compare the phase structure . in the bosonic model , the @xmath12 symmetry is broken below the critical volume . in the supersymmetric model it is expected to be broken in any finite volume  @xcite . the argument in  @xcite is valid only large and small volume region and it is desirable to check the breakdown of @xmath12 at intermediate volume .",
    "an obstacle for the simulation is the existence of the flat direction , along which two scalar fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 commute . in contrary to a theory on @xmath37 , there is no superselection of the moduli parameter in this case .",
    "that is , eigenvalues of scalars are determined dynamically .",
    "therefore , some mechanism which restrict eigenvalues to a finite region is necessary in order for the stable simulation .",
    "one possible way is to introduce an ir regulator and gradually remove it . in",
    "@xcite this method has been applied to the @xmath38 theory at finite temperature . in those works ,",
    "a mass term of scalars has been introduced and physical quantities are evaluated by an extrapolation to the massless limit or evaluated with small scalar mass . in this case , as we will see , in fact the scalar eigenvalues spread as ir regulator is removed . in string terminology , this phase can be understood as a gas of freely propagating d - branes .    at large-@xmath10 , there is a more interesting phase , namely a bound state in which eigenvalues clump to a small region  @xcite .",
    "it is metastable at finite-@xmath10 and becomes stable at large-@xmath10 .",
    "this bound state is a cousin of the one in one - dimensional system , which has been found in  @xcite , and corresponds to the black brane background in type ii superstring .",
    "( the black brane solution in supergravity corresponds to the bound state of the d - branes . because the scalar fields represent the collective coordinates of the d - branes , the bunch of the d - branes is nothing but the bound state of scalar eigenvalues . ) in this paper we study this phase .",
    "because the very existence of this bound state is nontrivial from a purely field - theoretical point of view , we provide numerical evidence .",
    "as we will see , with periodic - periodic ( p - p ) boundary conditions for fermions , we construct the bound state explicitly . in this bound state , there are two possible phases , namely the @xmath4 broken and unbroken phases .",
    "( the model has global @xmath4 symmetry , which shifts the complex phases of wilson loops winding on circles . if wilson loops are non - zero , then the @xmath4 symmetry is spontaneously broken . )",
    "we study the phase structure under the variation of the periods . because of the limitation of the resources ,",
    "we study only the case of @xmath39 .",
    "we confirm that , in the bound state , the @xmath4 symmetry is broken as discussed in  @xcite . with antiperiodic - periodic ( a - p ) boundary conditions ,",
    "we need rather large @xmath10 to find such an bound state and we could not construct it numerically . hence we can not discuss the thermal properties of the black brane in this paper",
    ". however we can expect that we can study the finite temperature system in near future , by using a faster computer .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in    [ sec : phase diagram ] we review the conjectured phase diagram and explain its physical implications . in    [ sec : simulation ] we show the numerical results .",

    "lattice size was taken to be @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 and other parameters are taken to be @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that the expectation values , especially that of the wilson loop , are not sensitive to the lattice spacing used in the simulation .",
    "note that @xmath41 lattice at @xmath46 is the coarsest one in this work .",

    "the action in the continuum has the following discrete symmetries ( we follow the notation in the appendix ) : @xmath47 and @xmath48 because of these symmetries , in the continuum limit , all four yukawa interaction terms @xmath49 ( for explicit forms , see appendix ) should give an identical expectation value . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf ] , we plot them for the coarsest ( @xmath46 with @xmath41 lattice ) and the finest ( @xmath50 with @xmath41 lattice ) cases with @xmath51 . , and because of a difference of the normalization of the kinetic term , the lattice spacing defined by the same manner as  @xcite becomes smaller by a factor @xmath52 . ]",
    "we also plot @xmath53 case using the same configuration used to plot fig .  8 in  @xcite .",
    "the plots show that the expectation values from the finest lattice are almost degenerated for all @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and it strongly suggests that this discrete symmetry is restored in the continuum limit",
    ". therefore we can expect that supersymmetries broken by a lattice artifact are restored in the continuum limit , because they are related to the exactly kept supersymmetry via this discrete symmetry .",
    "note that , although the coarsest case would have some effects from the lattice artifacts , at least for the quantities like the wilson loop such effects are negligible , as we have seen above .",
    "a remark on the previous simulation  @xcite is in order here . in  @xcite",
    ", the restoration of supersymmetries which are explicitly broken by lattice artifacts has been studied . in that work , expectation values of two - point functions are used .",
    "( in the present simulation , this technique can not be used because the lattice is too small to calculate the two - point functions . ) in fig .",
    "8 and  9 in  @xcite , four different two - point functions are plotted for p - p case which should be degenerated because of the above discrete symmetries .",
    "the plots , however , does not show the degenerate behavior and hence it seems that the simulation is far from the continuum limit . the non - degenerate behavior is again found in the lowest plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf ] while in the first plot from the current simulation almost degenerated behavior can be seen .",
    "in this paper we have studied large-@xmath10 properties of two - dimensional @xmath0 sym .",
    "especially we have established the existence of the bound state in which scalar eigenvalues clump around the origin .",
    "it makes the simulation well - defined in spite of the existence of the flat direction along which scalar eigenvalues spread to infinity .",
    "we also have shown numerically that at finite volume global @xmath56 is broken .",
    "this symmetry is restored in the large volume limit .    if the @xmath4 symmetry were not broken , then because of the eguchi - kawai equivalence the expectation values of the loops would not depend on the volume in the large-@xmath10 limit  @xcite .",
    "the eguchi - kawai equivalence works for bosonic yang - mills only above a critical volume  @xcite because the @xmath57 symmetry is broken below it .",
    "the twisted  @xcite and quenched  @xcite eguchi - kawai models were believed to cure this problem , but recently turned out to fail in the large-@xmath10 limit  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the backgrounds collapses due to large fluctuations .",
    "( another deformation has been proposed in  @xcite . ) for supersymmetric theories the @xmath12 symmetry was expected not to be broken , but as shown in this paper , it is not necessarily the case . however , once we combine the idea of twisted or quenched eguchi - kawai model with the supersymmetry then the @xmath12-unbroken background becomes stable  @xcite and the eguchi - kawai equivalence can hold .",
    "a concrete proposal has been given in  @xcite .",
    "studying this direction further is very important , because using the eguchi - kawai equivalence we can regularize planar sym in higher dimensions ( 3d and 4d ) without using lattice , and hence we may avoid the difficulties in lattice susy .    although finite - temperature properties of the bound state is very interesting in connection to the black hole thermodynamics , it is much more difficult to study because we need to take @xmath10 to be rather large .",
    "the same difficulty exists in matrix quantum mechanics , though large enough @xmath10 ( say @xmath58 ) can be taken in that case  @xcite because the model requires less computational resources . in  @xcite , to avoid this difficulty at rather small @xmath10 , finite - temperature properties of the matrix quantum mechanics have been studied by performing the simulation with the periodic boundary condition and then taking into account the effect of the antiperiodic boundary condition by the reweighting method .",
    "this method would work for the @xmath12-broken phase ( `` black hole '' and `` non - uniform black string '' ) .",
    "however , for the @xmath12-unbroken phase , this method might not work because we expect a severer overlapping problem . in any case",
    ", we expect an unambiguous study of the thermal properties with large enough @xmath10 will be possible in near future",
