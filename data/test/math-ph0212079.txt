    "-5 mm    the term `` soliton '' entered applied mathematics in 1965 . it was coined by m.  kruskal and n.  zabusky for a special solution of nonlinear korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , depicting solitary wave @xcite .",
    "use of convention of particle physics language shows that the author envisioned the particle - like interpretation for the object which they called soliton .",
    "the attention of mathematical physicists to solitons was attracted after the inverse scattering method was devised by g.  gardner , j.  green , m.  kruskal and r.  miura for solving the kdv equation @xcite and its extension to nonlinear schroedinger equation was found by v.  zakharov and a.  shabat @xcite . in the 1970 s this method and",
    "its generalizations got a lot of attention and involved quite a few active participants .",
    "rather complete review can be found in @xcite . in the end of that decade the quantum variant of the method",
    "was constructed and particle - like interpretations of solitons got natural confirmation in terms of quantum field theory , see review in @xcite .",
    "the mathematical structure of the quantum method was deciphered in pure algebraic way leading in the 1980 s to notion of quantum groups with new applications in pure mathematics and mathematical physics .",
    "the value of solitons for the particle physics consists in the possibility of going beyond the paradigm of the perturbation theory . indeed , soliton solutions correspond to full nonlinear equations and disappear in their linearized form .",
    "characteristic for solitons is that they interact strongly if the excitations of the linearized fields interact weakly .",
    "another attractive feature is the appearance of elementary topological characteristics for solitons topological charges .",
    "this was understood already in the middle of 1970 s by several groups as i underlined in my lectures , when i was touring usa in 1975 ( see e.  g. @xcite ) . however , all these tantalizing features of solitons had one very important drawback : the developed methods applied only in 1 + 1 dimensional space - time .",
    "naturally the search for 3 + 1 dimensional generalizations became eminent .",
    "general considerations showed that many features of 1 + 1 dimensional systems , such as complete integrability and existence of exact many - particle solutions could not be generalized to 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "however , the mere existence of `` one - particle '' soliton solutions was not excluded .",
    "one particular example was introduced by skyrme in a pioneer paper @xcite long before the soliton rush .",
    "another example was proposed by g.  t  hooft and a.  polyakov in 1975 @xcite . in the following years their solutions got real applications in nuclear and high energy physics .    in both examples",
    "the solitons are `` point - like '' , namely their deviation from the vacuum is concentrated around central point in space .",
    "moreover they have spherical symmetry , allowing the separation of variables in the corresponding equations , reducing them to ode , which one can treat on a usual pc",
    ".    in my lectures @xcite , already mentioned , i proposed one more possibility for 3 + 1 dimensional system , allowing solitons . the model , which superficially looks as a slight modification of skyrme model , has quite distinct features .",
    "the center of the would - be soliton is not a point , but a closed contour , possibly linked or knotted .",
    "however my proposal remained unnoticed .",
    "the reason was evident : the maximal symmetry for such a soliton is axial , reducing 3-dimensional nonlinear pde to 2-dimensional one .",
    "existing computers were not able to treat such a problem .",
    "thus my proposal was in slumber for 20 years until my colleague antti niemi became interested and agreed to sacrifice a year to learn computing and devising the programm .",
    "the preliminary results published in @xcite attracted the attention of professionals in computational physics and now we have an ample evidence , confirming my proposal @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the development which followed showed unexpected universality of my model .",
    "the variables , used in it , were shown to enter the list of degrees of freedom for several systems , having realistic physical applications @xcite , @xcite .    in this talk",
    "i shall describe all these developments in detail .",
    "first i shall introduce the model , then briefly discuss its numerical treatment and finish with the description of the applications .",
    "-5 mm    the space time is 4-dimensional minkowski space @xmath0 with linear coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 being time and @xmath4 , @xmath5 space variables .",
    "the field @xmath6 is defined on @xmath0 and has values on 2-dimensional sphere @xmath7 : @xmath8 the boundary condition on spatial infinity is introduced @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a fixed vector , e.g. corresponding to the north pole @xmath12 we shall consider mostly the time independent configurations , corresponding to a soliton at rest . the boundary condition ( [ boundc ] ) effectively compactifies the space @xmath13 , turning it into sphere @xmath14 , thus the stationary configurations realize the map @xmath15 which are known to be classified by hopf invariant , sort of topological charge .    in general , the density of topological charge is the zero component @xmath16 of the current @xmath17 , which is conserved @xmath18 independently of the equations of motion .",
    "mathematically it is more natural to use the 3-form @xmath19 dual to 1-form @xmath20 and define the topological charge as an integral of @xmath19 over space section @xmath21    in our case the 3-form @xmath19 is constructed as follows .",
    "the pull - back of the volume 2-form on @xmath7 via map ( [ map23 ] ) defines the closed 2-form on the space time @xmath22 where antisymmetric tensor @xmath23 is expressed via field configuration @xmath6 as follows @xmath24 here i use usual notations of vector analysis in 3-space .",
    "in fact @xmath25 is exact @xmath26 and current 3-form is given by @xmath27 in more detail , we have the relations @xmath28 and @xmath29    for regular configurations @xmath30 gets integer values .",
    "this integer has a nice interpretation in the description of which i shall use the terminology of magnetostatic .",
    "tensor @xmath31 can be interpreted as a field strength of the stationary magnetic field in maxwell theory .",
    "the corresponding lines of force are defined via equations @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a local parameter along the line .",
    "it is easy to see that components of @xmath6 along these lines are constant @xmath34 giving two `` integrals of the motion '' . in other words ,",
    "the maxwell lines of force are the preimages of points on @xmath7 under the map ( [ map23 ] ) .",
    "hopf invariant is the intersection number of any pair of such lines .",
    "all these facts are well known and can be found in textbooks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however i decided to include them into my text to make it more selfcontained .",
    "-5 mm    i introduce the dynamical model by giving the relativistic action functional @xmath35 in the usual convention of high - energy physics @xmath36 is dimensionless , so the parameter @xmath37 has dimension @xmath38^{-2 } $ ] and parameter @xmath39 is dimensionless",
    ". corresponding static energy @xmath40 has the same form as @xmath36 with space - time coordinates substituted by space variables only @xmath41 and has proper dimension @xmath38^{-1 } $ ] .",
    "the structure of @xmath40 is similar to that of skyrme model , where the field variable having values in @xmath14 is used and corresponding topological charge is just a degree of map .",
    "usual check based on the scale transformation is favorable for ( [ energy ] ) in the same way as in skyrme model .",
    "indeed @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are quadratic and quartic in derivatives of @xmath45 correspondingly .",
    "thus under scaling @xmath46 we have @xmath47 and the virial theorem states that on the minimal configuration ( if any ) @xmath48    in terms of quantum theory @xmath43 has a standard interpretation of the energy of nonlinear sigma - model whereas @xmath44 is rather exotic . on the contrary in the magnetic interpretation , mentioned above , @xmath44 is a natural term  it is just the maxwell magnetic energy , whereas the nature of @xmath43 is not that clear .",
    "however in what follows the presence of both @xmath43 and @xmath44 is crucial for the existence of solitons as the scaling argument already showed .",
    "this is confirmed also by a beautiful estimate , obtained in @xcite @xmath49 which shows that in the sectors with nonzero @xmath30 the minimum of energy is strongly positive .",
    "thus the soliton solutions should be obtained by the minimizing of @xmath40 with @xmath50 fixed .    unfortunately until now there exists no proof of the compactness of the minimizing sequence in general case . for the case of axial symmetry uncouraging result",
    "are obtained in @xcite .",
    "so the main argument for the evidence of solitons in my model is based on the numerical work .",
    "-5 mm    to find the numerical evidence of the existence of localized solitons it is not necessary to solve the nonlinear elliptic equation , obtained by the variational principle @xmath51 instead one can introduce an auxiliary time @xmath33 and consider the parabolic equation @xmath52 with initial value @xmath53 @xmath54 being a configuration with the prescribed hopf invariant .",
    "of course to simulate ( [ pe ] ) on the computer one is to use some difference scheme .",
    "if for large @xmath33 solution of ( [ pe ] ) stabilizes it gives the solution of ( [ ve ] ) .",
    "in other words the soliton appears as an attractor for the evolution equation .",
    "there are of course many important practical details how to discretize equation , how to take into account the normalization condition @xmath55 and how to choose the initial configuration @xmath53 .",
    "the main papers @xcite and @xcite use different prescription for all this , however quite satisfactorily the final results coincide .",
    "i refer to these papers for the details of calculations and proceed to describe the results .",
    "the iterative process was performed for the configuration with @xmath56 .",
    "the results are as follows : for @xmath57 and @xmath58 the solutions are axial symmetric . the center line  the preimage of the point @xmath59  is a circle .",
    "the surfaces @xmath60 , @xmath61 are toroidal and they are spanned by the lines of force wrapping the torus once for @xmath57 and twice for @xmath58 . in other words the soliton can be viewed as a filament of lines of force , closed and twisted once or twice .    the solution for @xmath62 is similar but not axial symmetric any more , the corresponding `` cable '' is warped . for @xmath63 the soliton is a link of two twisted filaments . especially beautiful case is @xmath64 , the central line of the corresponding soliton is a trefoil knot .",
    "the file @xcite contains impressive moving pictures illustrating the convergence of the iterations .",
    "i plan to show these movies in my talk , but unfortunately can not do it in a written text .",
    "thus the numerical work gives the compelling evidence of the existence of string - like solitons in my model .",
    "there remains an important mathematical challenge to provide the rigorous existence theorem .",
    "another interesting direction is to find some realistic applications of the model .",
    "some progress in this direction is already obtained and i proceed to the description of it .",
    "-5 mm    nonlinear fields such as @xmath6 rarely enter the dynamical models directly",
    ". however they can appear as a part of degrees of freedom in a suitable parameterization of the original fields .",
    "for example in condensed matter theory one uses the complex valued functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 to describe the density amplitudes of bose gas or the gap function of superconductor .",
    "the interaction supports the configurations , for which @xmath67 is nonvanishing . in this case",
    "it is natural to use @xmath68 as one of the independent variables and introduce new variables @xmath69 such that @xmath70    in this way the compact target ( i use the slang of the string theory ) @xmath71 appears .    when magnetic interaction is introduced the invariance with respect to the phase transformation @xmath72 is invoked .",
    "this means that the target @xmath71 changes @xmath73 in particular for @xmath74 we have @xmath75 and the field @xmath6 naturally appears .",
    "quite satisfactorily the tensor @xmath31 also emerges as a contribution to the magnetic field strength .",
    "let us illustrate it in more detail . from the beginning we shall treat the stationary system , so no electric field will be used .",
    "the magnetic field is described in a usual way by means of the vector potential @xmath76 and its interaction with @xmath77-fields is introduced via covariant derivatives @xmath78 the energy density ( of landau - ginsburg - gross - pitaevsky type ) looks as follows @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the field strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the energy is invariant with respect to the gauge transformations @xmath81 we shall make the change of the field variables so that only gauge invariant ones will remain .",
    "for that observe that the first term in the rhs of ( [ lggp ] ) is a quadratic form in @xmath82 @xmath83 where we use variable @xmath68 from ( [ rho ] ) and introduce current @xmath84 it is easy to check , that under the gauge transformations the current @xmath85 changes as follows @xmath86 so that the sum @xmath87 is gauge invariant .",
    "we shall use this variable instead of @xmath88 .",
    "another gauge invariant combination is given by the quadratic form @xmath89 where @xmath90 are pauli matrices @xmath91 normalization ( [ sph ] ) for @xmath92 implies that @xmath45 is a real unit vector .",
    "in fact the map @xmath93 defined in ( [ himap ] ) is a standard hopf map .",
    "variable @xmath45 is manifestly gauge invariant and the set of variables @xmath94 is our gauge invariant choice , substituting for the initial set @xmath95 .",
    "the energy density can be explicitly expressed via @xmath96 and @xmath97 as follows @xmath98 the most notable feature is the appearance of the tensor @xmath31 , defined in ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "the model , described in the main text , emerges if we put @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "hopefully nontrivial @xmath68 and @xmath101 , at least confined to some range , do not spoil the soliton picture .",
    "this problem is under discussion now , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us stress , that the use of two fields @xmath102 , @xmath103 is most essential in this example . if @xmath104 only variables @xmath68 and @xmath101 remain after the reduction , similar to just described .",
    "if @xmath105 the @xmath106 field generalizing @xmath45 has no topological characteristics .",
    "another application , considered recently @xcite , deals with the parameterization for the @xmath107 yang - mills field @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "the yang - mills lagrangian is invariant with respect to the nonabelian gauge transformations @xmath111 however in some treatments one reduces this invariance by the partial gauge fixing to the abelian one @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a complex vector field .",
    "i shall not discuss the reason for this reduction here and proceed assuming that it is done .",
    "observe , that two vector fields @xmath114 , @xmath115 in generic situation define a plane in minkowski space and introduce an orthonormalized basis in this plane @xmath116 , @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath117 let @xmath118 .",
    "the basis is defined up to rotation @xmath119 the fields @xmath120 can be written in terms of this basis as @xmath121 and thus two complex valued fields @xmath122 and @xmath123 appear .",
    "the situation becomes quite similar to the previous example and indeed in @xcite the complete parameterization of the yang - mills variables is introduced with appearance of @xmath45-field and corresponding @xmath25-tensor .",
    "this is an indication that the yang - mills theory can have string - like excitations .",
    "however the situation is not that simple .",
    "the classical yang - mills theory is conformally invariant and has no dimensional parameters .",
    "thus no hope for the localized regular classical solution exists .",
    "nevertheless this complication could be lifted by quantum corrections .",
    "the famous `` dimensional transmutation '' , which leads to the appearance of dimensional parameter in quantum effective action , could favor the nonvanishing value of the corresponding @xmath68-variable .",
    "all these considerations at the moment are rather speculative and need much more work to become reasonable .",
    "personally i am quite impressed by this possibility and continue to work on it .",
    "-5 mm    i think that the topic of my talk is quite instructive .",
    "it connects different domains in mathematics and mathematical physics : nonlinear pde , elementary topology , quantum field theory , numerical methods .",
    "it illustrates the essential unity of mathematics , theoretical and applied .",
    "finally it could lead to the realistic physical applications .",
