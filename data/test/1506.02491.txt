    "the original bottom - up thermalization ansatz @xcite in its basis has the parton saturation mechanism expected to be valid at high parton densities .",
    "it leads to thermalization / equilibration of a parton system produced after a heavy ion collision .",
    "this scenario emphasizes the importance of branching processes of initially produced gluons , and as a consequence of such processes the total number of gluons increases between the initial and thermalization times of the evolution of the system .",
    "the bottom - up does a good job in predictions of charged hadron multiplicities observed at rhic and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the overall bottom - up picture can also be modified @xcite to include other possibilities for evolution of the produced matter , which we shall refer to as _ modified _ bottom - up parton system or simply as _ m_bottom - up parton system .",
    "the modification is done by a scaling solution to pre - equilibrium evolution which interpolates between initial plasma instabilities @xcite present in the dense gluon system produced immediately after a collision , and the final equilibration .",
    "depending on a single parameter known as the momentum asymmetry parameter @xmath0 , the scaling solution matches onto the original bottom - up picture either at an intermediate stage or toward the end of the evolution given by the original bottom - up .",
    "thus , by having the original picture modified we further argue that in the _ m_bottom - up scenario the dominant qualitative and semi - quantitative features of the evolution of a parton system can be described by two momentum scales , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "note that in the original bottom - up the evolution is described only by one scale - the saturation momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the situation somewhat resembles the overpopulated glasma , where two dynamical scales @xmath4 and @xmath5 are introduced to describe the dynamics of the system from the overpopulated initial stage all the way to thermalization @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 can describe the dynamics of the _ m_bottom - up parton system from its initial stage toward thermalization",
    ". however , depending on the parameter @xmath0 , the thermalization time and the thermalization temperature obtained , can be of the same order ( or different ) as compared with those derived in the original bottom - up scenario .",
    "the results of this paper can be useful for calculating the yield of direct photons and di - electrons as well as the elliptic flow of direct photons , in particular , in au+au collisions at @xmath6 collision energy , measured by the phenix experimental collaboration @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief overview of the glasma dynamical scales . in the third section",
    "we derive some quantities , which describe quark - gluon matter , by using the dynamical scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the _ m_bottom - up scenario . besides",
    ", we also show that these and glasma scales are the same at least on the parametric level . in the last section",
    "we show some estimates of the thermalization time and temperature at 200gev .",
    "first , let us discuss what happens in the glasma .",
    "the glasma is theorized to exist from the earliest time after a heavy ion collision when the fields are considered to be highly coherent , and when most of the energy is in coherent field degrees of freedom rather than in the degrees of freedom of incoherent quarks and gluons . thereby , the matter in this phase is neither the quark - gluon plasma nor the color glass condensate , however , it has features of both . almost instantaneously after the collision , the transverse color fields of the color glass condensate transform into the longitudinal color electric and color magnetic fields of the glasma @xcite . in this scenario the gluons , in the sense of particles , are produced from the classical evolution of such color electric and magnetic fields , and after initial plasma instabilities produce a distribution that is approximately isotropic in momentum space .",
    "the evolutionary and thermalization processes of the glasma and _ m_bottom - up scenarios are different from each other because of the underlying mechanisms by which they work .",
    "nonetheless , they can have some properties which are similar phenomenologically , and we shall investigate these properties in this paper . in this section",
    "we follow the lines of reasoning represented in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is expected that on the transverse momentum and mass scales the effects stemming from evolution to the thermalized distribution of gluons are enhanced .",
    "the evolution of the system toward thermalization can be traced based on the boltzmann transport equation : @xmath7\\ , , \\label{eqn_boltzmann}\\ ] ] where the @xmath8 $ ] is the collision integral , and the @xmath9 is the particle distribution function .",
    "the main qualitative features of the solution of the boltzmann equation can be described if it is assumed that the evolution is dominated by only two scales - the  infrared \" @xmath5 and  ultraviolet \" @xmath4 , characterizing the gluon distributions in the glasma .",
    "it is also assumed that the elastic collisions play a dominant role in driving the initial gluon distribution toward local equilibrium .",
    "the scale @xmath10 is a momentum scale at which the distributions are highly coherent , and it is time dependent .",
    "the scale @xmath4 above which the distributions become dilute is also time dependent , which coincides at the earliest time with @xmath5 : @xmath11 ( the @xmath12 is the proper time of the collision ) .",
    "along with time these scales separate from each other where the @xmath5 decreases rapidly , and the @xmath4 evolves more slowly . upon reaching equilibration , the @xmath4 becomes the initial temperature of the quark - gluon plasma : @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the infrared scale becomes the so called non - perturbative `` magnetic scale '' @xcite in the thermalized matter : @xmath14 , where the @xmath15 is the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the thermalization is accomplished by parametrically splitting apart these initially overlapping momentum scales by @xmath15 , and the corresponding time is determined from the following requirement : @xmath16 at which the gluon occupation number , @xmath17 , becomes of the order of unity . generally , the @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath18 which is down to the ultraviolet scale , whereas the thermal distribution , @xmath19 , builds up from the infrared scale gradually .",
    "thus , the gluon distribution becomes a thermal gluon distribution function when the infrared scale satisfies the condition in eq.([eqn_glasma_scales ] ) .    in the momentum space",
    "there are the following cases ( at time @xmath20 ) in the corresponding three ranges : @xmath21 where the @xmath22 is the gluon momentum , and the @xmath23 its energy . in general",
    ", the occupation number is expressed as @xmath24 additionally , the gluon density and the debye mass are expressed via the scales @xmath4 and @xmath5 :",
    "@xmath25 @xmath26 at the initial time , by having the @xmath27 and @xmath28 , these two equations are represented as @xmath29 @xmath30 at the thermalization time they will have forms represented by the initial temperature of the quark - gluon plasma : @xmath31 @xmath32 the time evolution is dominated by the gluon density , and there can be some fixed asymmetry between the typical transverse and longitudinal momentum scales characterized by a parameter @xmath33 which is defined in terms of the longitudinal pressure : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 corresponding to the maximal anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse pressure , and @xmath37 corresponding to the isotropic expansion . finally ,",
    "since the electromagnetic particle production arises from quark charges , the quark distribution function should also be included in the overall evolutionary picture : @xmath38 that brings out the quark density as @xmath39 initially not many quarks are present in the matter and this is suppressed by the power of @xmath15 , which is small if the @xmath1 is large compared to the qcd scale @xmath40 .",
    "namely , at the earliest times , @xmath41 , nevertheless , later the two densities approach each other becoming parametrically of the same order , @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , in the time interval @xmath43 the quark density increases to a value being of the order of the gluon density , and is no longer suppressed .",
    "thus , the quark production at @xmath44 might not be significant , or anyway not as significant as at later times .",
    "now let us discuss what happens in the _ m_bottom - up scenario .",
    "the bottom - up evolution is also based on using the solution of the boltzmann equation which , with inclusion of the particle production , makes the parton system approach the kinetic equilibration during a time of the order of @xmath45 as obtained in @xcite .",
    "the thermalization occurs in the limit of @xmath46 , which corresponds to very large nuclei or very high collision energy .",
    "let us start with the original bottom - up , which is a mechanism that describes the system evolving toward the thermalization / equilibration after passing through three distinct stages .",
    "* _ stage1_. shortly after the collision , hard gluons are produced being distributed highly anisotropically .",
    "these gluons dominate in the time range of @xmath47 . * _ stage2_. in this phase these initial hard gluons still dominate but start emitting soft gluons via qcd branching . the soft gluons in turn equilibrate and",
    "form a thermal bath , which initially carries only a small fraction of the total energy of the system .",
    "also , the thermal bath draws energy from the hard gluons .",
    "these processes occur in the range of @xmath48 .",
    "the soft gluons start to overwhelm the hard gluons , in terms of number , at @xmath49 . *",
    "_ stage3_. now the soft gluons are thermalized but continue drawing energy from the hard gluons until all the energy is removed from them and the whole system is equilibrated .",
    "the full thermalization is achieved when the primary gluons have lost all their energy to the soft gluon bath .",
    "parametrically , this occurs at @xmath45 which is the end of the time range of this final stage : @xmath50 .",
    "however , after taking into account the existence of collective effects in the form of plasma instabilities @xcite in the initial stage of the bottom - up picture , one can think about a rapid thermalization scenario .",
    "it is because the plasma instabilities occurring in the dense gluon system produced immediately after a collision , increase the amount of energy transformation from initially produced hard modes to soft modes radiated by the hard ones .",
    "meanwhile , it has been shown in @xcite that the full equilibration time in the presence of the instabilities is not much shorter relative to that of the bottom - up . but these instabilities can not lead directly to the equilibration since they would give an equilibration time parametrically of the order of @xmath51 . for a more detailed insight into this problem , a scaling solution has been proposed @xcite for following the evolution between the instabilities taking place in the initial phase and the system in the final equilibration .",
    "this solution , depending on one single parameter @xmath0 , matches onto the intermediate stage and/or the late stage of the evolution of the system given by the bottom - up thermalization , where the @xmath0 accepts values in the range of @xmath52 . as in the case of the glasma , here",
    "the @xmath0 again describes the asymmetry between the transverse and longitudinal scales of the gluon interactions .",
    "the scaling solution makes the bottom - up scenario getting modified to the more general _ m_bottom - up scenario .",
    "the number @xmath53 is the absolute limit the @xmath0 may accept in the _ m_bottom - up .",
    "so the proposed scaling solution is given by the following set of equations : @xmath54 where the @xmath55 is the number density of the soft gluons , the @xmath56 is the soft gluon momentum , the @xmath57 is the soft gluon occupation number , and the @xmath58 is the debye mass",
    ".      there might be a question about whether or not similar ( or different ) momentum scales , such as the discussed glasma @xmath4 and @xmath5 scales , are applicable for the _ m_bottom - up .",
    "conceptually it should take place , since as it was stated before the main qualitative features of the solution of the boltzmann equation can be described with an assumption that the evolution is dominated by such scales . in the case of the _ m_bottom - up",
    "let us designate these scales as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and check whether or not such scales can really exist .",
    "making use of the second formula of eq.([eqn_glasma_distributions ] ) , we assume that an equivalent relation ( with @xmath59 at @xmath60 ) can exist in the _ m_bottom - up picture , though it is not the case in the original bottom - up :",
    "f(p ) ~1 _ s_s p_s < p < . [ bottom_distribution_g ]",
    "these scales are related to the soft gluon density @xmath55 : @xmath61 and to the debye mass @xmath58 : @xmath62 for the quark occupation number we use @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 as in the case of glasma , this also comes from the reasoning that at the earliest times we have @xmath65 but at later times ( for example , at thermalization ) @xmath66 . here",
    ", the @xmath67 is the number density of the primary hard gluons ( initial gluons ) .",
    "so how can we make sure that the scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 really hold in the _ m_bottom - up scenario ?",
    "one may see this if we look back at eq.([eqn_glasmagluon ] ) and eq.([eqn_glasmadebye ] ) , and start with the analogical equations for the _ m_bottom - up such as obtained in eq.([eqn_bottom_scales1 ] ) and eq.([eqn_bottom_scales2 ] ) : @xmath68 @xmath69 with the following requirements : @xmath70 and @xmath71 thereby , using eqs.([eqn_bottomgluon ] ) , ( [ eqn_bottomdebye ] ) , ( [ eqn_bottom_initial ] ) and ( [ eqn_bottom_boundary ] ) at the initial time @xmath72 , we shall have the  initial conditions \" : @xmath73 @xmath74 as it holds in the original bottom - up ansatz as well . at the thermalization time",
    "there should be the following conditions , which we name as  boundary conditions \" : @xmath75 @xmath76      in this section we show how eqs.([eqn_bottomgluon_fin ] ) and ( [ eqn_bottomdebye_fin ] ) can be derived in the _ m_bottom - up .",
    "for this purpose we should use the @xmath55 and @xmath58 from eq.([eqn_scaling ] ) , along with the thermal bath temperature @xmath77 from @xcite : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 independent of what value the @xmath0 takes , as long as @xmath81 , the temperature in eq.([eqn_bottom_temp ] ) and the scaling solution in eq.([eqn_scaling ] ) match up onto the final stage of the original bottom - up only at the final time @xmath82 . in this case the temperature in eq.([eqn_bottom_temp ] ) reduces to @xmath83 which is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , we should search for some solutions for @xmath55 and @xmath58 that should be @xmath0-independent .",

    "we use the result by the phobos collaboration @xcite , namely @xmath154.thus , @xmath155 the charged hadron multiplicity can be calculated as @xmath156 which is further simplified to be & & + & & 0.04354 ( 49 ) ^(5 - 15)/(5 + 3 ) c^3c_therm^(35 - 69)/(39- 10 ) ( ) ^18/(5 + 3 ) , [ eqn_multip2 ] where we use eq.([eqn_ratio ] ) for the ratio @xmath152 . here the charged hadron multiplicity will be equal to @xmath157 if the overall constant @xmath158 is taken adequately .    let us now find the @xmath159 and @xmath98 as functions of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "we will try two values for the gluon liberation coefficient : the first one calculated in @xcite with @xmath160 , and the second one in @xcite with @xmath161 .",
    "for example , at @xmath162 we will have @xmath163 @xmath164 if we use the above values of the  gluon liberation \" coefficient , then from eq.([eqn_therm_time ] ) and eq.([eqn_therm_temp2 ] ) we shall have the following fixed values for the thermalization time and temperature : c = 1.1 _ therm 3.45fm , t_therm 262mev .",
    "+ c = 2 _ therm 2.90fm , t_therm 277mev . also , at @xmath165 , and at @xmath166 . in fig.[omega_tau1 ] and fig.[omega_tau2 ] the solid lines show the @xmath0-dependent thermalization time @xmath159 at both values of @xmath140 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependent thermalization temperature @xmath98 at both values of @xmath140 is shown in fig.[omega_t ] .",
    "one may put some constraints on the possible values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it can be done if we find a time @xmath167 at which @xmath168 .",
    "namely , by using eq.([eqn_nhard ] ) and eq.([eqn_nsoft ] ) with eq.([eqn_therm_temp2 ] ) we derive @xmath169 it is obvious that at @xmath162 , this formula becomes parametrically the same as that of the original bottom - up , i.e. , @xmath168 at @xmath170 .",
    "then if we calculate the time @xmath167 at @xmath161 and @xmath171 for @xmath162 , we shall obtain the following result : & & c = 1.1_1 2.60fm , + & & c = 2_1 2.31fm .",
    "[ eqn_delta2 ] in fig.[omega_tau1 ] and fig.[omega_tau2 ] the dashed lines show the @xmath0-dependent @xmath167 at both values of @xmath140 .",
    "so since the soft gluons start to overwhelm , in terms of number , the primary hard gluons at @xmath172 , it means that the following inequality must always take place : @xmath173 . by comparing the results shown in fig.[omega_tau1 ] and fig.[omega_tau2 ] ,",
    "we see that the cases of @xmath174 should be excluded . on the other hand",
    ", we notice that the evolutionary picture looks highly unlikely at larger values of @xmath0 close to @xmath122 , which shows that the system never gets thermalized .",
    "thus , we find that the thermalization time and temperature at values of @xmath0 from a range around @xmath162 is comparable to those from @xcite .",
    "however , we should note that the results in figs.[omega_tau1 ] , [ omega_tau2 ] and [ omega_t ] are approximate because we make use of the parameter @xmath138 from eq.([eqn_numerical ] ) ( by having it from @xcite ) in our derivations of this section .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath138 can be @xmath0-dependent , which perhaps will ( or will not ) make the curves less steeper at large values of @xmath0 , and/or can alter the results for @xmath159 and @xmath98 to be similar to those from ref.@xcite at small values of @xmath0 .",
    "but the derivation of the @xmath0-dependent @xmath138 parameter is beyond the scope of this paper , which however will be considered in another work .",
