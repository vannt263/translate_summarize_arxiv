    "detection of gravitational waves is an exciting new observational frontier in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "ground - based laser interferometric detectors of new generation , such as advanced - ligo @xcite , advanced - virgo @xcite and kagra @xcite , are currently under construction .",
    "they promise to yield new insights on many types of astrophysical events . in future ,",
    "satellite experiments such as elisa @xcite , decigo @xcite and bbo @xcite would enable us to explore the universe with an unprecedented sensitivity at lower frequencies and provide a wealth of important information not only for astronomy , but also for cosmology .",
    "thanks to the weak interactions with matter , gravitational waves offer a unique opportunity to directly observe the earliest epochs of the universe beyond the last scattering surface of photons .",
    "one interesting source of gravitational waves in the early universe is a scalar field whose non - vanishing expectation value breaks a global @xmath1 symmetry @xcite . after the phase transition , the self - ordering of the goldstone modes continuously sources gravitational waves at the horizon scale and produce a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "such scale - invariant gravitational waves can be tested by various types of experiments at different frequency bands . while ground - based direct detection experiments have sensitivity at @xmath2hz , space missions explore gravitational waves at lower frequencies ; elisa will probe @xmath3hz ; and decigo / bbo is designed to measure those at @xmath4hz .",
    "there are also indirect means of observations such as b - mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and pulsar timing observations @xcite , which can probe gravitational waves at @xmath5hz and @xmath6hz , respectively .",
    "several analytical and numerical studies have been conducted to estimate the amplitude of the gravitational wave background from a global phase transition @xcite and their results are mutually consistent in the large @xmath7 limit .",
    "the effects on cmb have also been studied in the literature , in terms of temperature and polarization anisotropies @xcite , non - gaussianity @xcite and spectral distortions @xcite .",
    "the difference from the inflationary gravitational wave background , which also has a nearly scale - invariant spectrum , has been studied in @xcite focusing on the cmb scale .",
    "recently , the planck satellite has placed an upper limit on the effective defect energy scale of global textures , @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is newton s constant .",
    "the energy scale @xmath10 is related with the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath11 scalar fields , @xmath12 , as @xmath13 .",
    "and @xmath12 is different from the planck paper by a factor of @xmath14 , because we adopt a lagrangian of real scalar fields in this paper , while the planck paper uses the lagrangian of complex scalar fields .",
    "for details see the appendix in ref . @xcite . ] in terms of @xmath12 , the constraint is rewritten as @xmath15 with @xmath16 gev being the planck scale .",
    "the contribution on the b - mode polarization signal has also been studied motivated by the bicep2 experiment @xcite and a slightly better constraint is obtained , @xmath17 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath18 . since the peak of the signal in the b - mode spectrum arises at different scale , the constraint on gravitational waves from a global @xmath1 phase transition is weaker compared to that of inflation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of reheating on the gravitational wave spectrum of a global @xmath1 phase transition , and make a prediction for future direct detection experiments .",
    "it is known that the hubble expansion rate of the universe makes difference in the power of generated gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "it also affects the decline rate of the amplitude due to redshift after generation . after the phase transition ,",
    "gravitational waves are continuously generated as the random initial configuration of the scalar field is homogenized up to the hubble horizon scale at each epoch , and information of expansion rate is contained in the spectral amplitude of the mode . in the ordinary scenario of reheating , the universe is dominated by the coherently oscillating inflaton field with a quadratic inflaton potential , which results in the same expansion rate as that of the matter - dominated universe . when reheating is completed , the universe becomes radiation - dominated .",
    "therefore , information on the transition of the expansion rate at the end of reheating may be imprinted in the gravitational waves generated around the completion of reheating .",
    "the corresponding frequency of the gravitational wave spectrum is related to the energy scale of reheating .",
    "a similar effect arises in the spectrum of the inflationary gravitational wave background .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that the effect arises in the sensitivity range of decigo and bbo , if the energy scale of reheating , or similar mechanism to yield a matter - dominated early universe such as a late - time entropy production , is around @xmath19gev @xcite . the same would be expected in the case of a global @xmath1 phase transition , and could be explored by those experiments .    in this paper , we perform lattice simulations to explicitly evaluate the effect of reheating on the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "while inflationary gravitational waves are generated when each mode crosses outside the hubble horizon during inflation , in the case of the @xmath1 phase transition , gravitational waves are sourced by the anisotropic stress of the scalar field when the mode enters the horizon after the phase transition .",
    "because of the difference in the generation process , the effect of reheating arises in a different way . to obtain the gravitational wave spectrum , we follow the evolution of both the scalar field and gravitational wave in a 3-dimensional lattice with changing the background equation of state .",
    "lattice simulations provide an accurate estimate including non - linear dynamics of the scalar field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe background equations during reheating , and the evolution equations of the scalar field and gravitational waves , used in the lattice simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we show the spectra obtained from our simulations . then we discuss the differences between the spectrum from the @xmath1 phase transition and that from inflation .",
    "furthermore , we perform a fisher matrix analysis and investigate whether we can determine the reheating temperature by observing the reheating signature in the spectrum with future experiments such as decigo and ultimate decigo .",
    "we also discuss if we can determine the origin of the observed gravitational wave background by measuring the small differences between inflation and @xmath1 phase transition origin .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we describe setup for our simulation . for the background",
    ", we assume the conventional reheating scenario in which the inflaton energy is transferred to the radiation energy while the inflaton oscillates around the bottom of its quadratic potential .",
    "the inflaton energy is the dominant component during the reheating phase and the expansion rate is the same as the matter - dominated universe .",
    "as the energy - transfer process proceeds , the universe becomes radiation - dominated .",
    "under this background , we consider a phase transition , where the global @xmath1 symmetry of a scalar field is broken to @xmath20 .",
    "the field rolls down to the true vacuum when the symmetry is broken , and each causally disconnected region of the universe gets arbitrarily different directions of the field , which yields the spatial gradient of the field on superhorizon scales . as the comoving hubble horizon grows , previously causally disconnected regions come into contact and the field moves to match the orientation , which is called self - ordering .",
    "the field releases gradient energy as it relaxes and generates anisotropic stresses that source gravitational waves .",
    "we consider the case where the symmetry breaking occurs well before the universe becomes radiation dominated , so that the information on the transition from matter- to radiation - dominated phase is imprinted on the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "we work in a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker background with the metric @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes conformal time and @xmath23 is the scale factor . for the reheating process",
    ", we assume a perturbative decay of the inflaton field @xmath24 into radiation . assuming that the inflaton potential @xmath25 is approximated as @xmath26 during the oscillating phase , the equation for the energy density of the scalar field is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28",

    "furthermore the initial value of the hubble parameter at the beginning of simulations also exceeds the constraints on the hubble parameter imposed by the tensor perturbations generated during standard inflation , although we can evade such a constraint if we adopt an inflation model in which the null energy condition is violated @xcite .",
    "the reason why we choose such nonstandard values of @xmath12 an @xmath43 is that , for small values of @xmath12 and @xmath116 , gravitational waves generated by self - ordering scalar fields after the phase transition are contaminated by those generated from the thermal fluctuations of the scalar fields before the transition . in order to suppress this contamination and focus on the effect from reheating , we use relatively large values of @xmath12 and @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , large @xmath12 enhances the power of gravitational wave spectrum from self - ordering with the dependence of @xmath117 , and large @xmath43 reduces the initial temperature and gives smaller thermal fluctuations before the phase transition ( see eqs .",

    "once simulations with such parameters are performed we can obtain results with other parameter values using the above mentioned scaling law @xmath118 as well as other scaling discussed below .",
    "figure 1 shows time evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "we see that higher - frequency modes come inside the horizon earlier and the gravitational wave is generated soon after the mode comes into the horizon .",
    "the modes outside the horizon have frequency dependence of @xmath119 , which matches the analytical prediction of refs .",
    "@xcite . note that the @xmath119 dependence remains in the final spectrum at the lowest frequencies , since we stop the simulation when the hubble radius becomes half the box size .",
    "however , if we could trace the time evolution longer , the @xmath120 dependence would continue toward the lower frequencies .",
    "for the modes inside the horizon at the end of simulation , we see the frequency dependence of the spectrum changes from @xmath121 to @xmath120 because of the transition from the matter - dominated to the radiation - dominated phase .",
    "the bump seen at the highest frequencies in the final regime of the simulation is an artifact due to the finite resolution ( see also fig . [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "gravitational waves are not produced if the mode is already inside the horizon at the time of the phase transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show spectra for smaller box sizes which give a better resolution . we confirm that the spectrum represented in red keeps the initial shape and",

    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the spectra in the case with different numbers of the scalar field components .",
    "note that the vertical axis is the power multiplied by @xmath7 .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum has the same dependence with the analytical prediction @xmath122 @xcite for large @xmath7 .",
    "contrarily , we find the extra power for small @xmath7 , which would imply the breakdown of the large @xmath7 approximation used in the analytical predictions . this point has been studied in ref . @xcite and",

    "as explained before , the damping of the power seen at the low frequencies is because of the limitation in the simulation time .",
    "the @xmath120 dependence therefore should continue to the lower frequencies . for the spectrum from inflation , we normalized the amplitude at low frequencies and take the value to be the same as the case of the @xmath1 phase transition for comparison .",
    "we also assume the same reheating temperature for both cases .    comparing the two spectra , we find that there is a difference in the position of the spectral bend .",
    "this is because gravitational waves are continuously generated even after the inward horizon crossing until each @xmath128 mode of scalar field fluctuations is homogenized .",
    "we also find that the sharpness of the transition from @xmath121 to @xmath120 is slightly different around the bend .",
    "let us introduce a fitting formula to describe the shape of the spectrum caused by reheating and approximate the spectrum as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the normalization of the spectral amplitude and @xmath131 is the transfer function which describes the transition from @xmath120 to @xmath121 . for inflation , the transfer function has been found as @xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134hz . for the @xmath1 phase transition",

    "<S> we investigate the imprint of reheating on the gravitational wave spectrum produced by self - ordering of multi - component scalar fields after a global phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state of the universe during reheating , which usually has different behaviour from that of a radiation - dominated universe , affects the evolution of gravitational waves through the hubble expansion term in the equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to a different power - law behavior of frequency in the gravitational wave spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the reheating history is therefore imprinted in the shape of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we perform @xmath0 lattice simulations to investigate how the ordering scalar field reacts to the change of the hubble expansion and how the reheating effect arises in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the result with inflation - produced gravitational waves , which has a similar spectral shape , and discuss whether it is possible to distinguish the origin between inflation and global phase transition by detecting the shape with future direct detection gravitational wave experiments such as decigo . </S>"
