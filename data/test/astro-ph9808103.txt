    "the problem of particle motion in electromagnetic fields is fundamental and pervades both laboratory and astrophysical plasma physics . in spite of the conceptual simplicity of the problem , theoretical analysis and numerical modeling of the particle motions",
    "can be difficult .",
    "often , in order either to simplify the analytical work or to reduce the demand on computer resources , the system of interest is considered in only one or two spatial dimensions , with the hope that no essential physics will be lost .",
    "it is readily shown that this approximation does have a number of important general consequences which can result in the loss of essential physics , and it must therefore be used with extreme caution . on the other hand ,",
    "some real physical systems have a symmetry such that one ( or even two ) coordinates are ignorable . in such cases",
    "this imposes a real constraint on the possible motions of charged particles . while we will discuss an example of this type of real symmetry",
    ", the primary emphasis of this paper will be to address the profound effect that this reduction of dimensionality has on theoretical studies of particle acceleration .",
    "jokipii , kta and giacalone ( @xcite ) , hereinafter called jkg , presented a general theorem regarding spatial constraints to charged - particle motion in an electromagnetic field which has at least one ignorable spatial coordinate , and discussed explicitly the application of this theorem to hybrid simulations of collisionless shock waves . in the context of hybrid plasma simulations",
    "the result has been stated in previous papers ( @xcite ) , so it has been known for a while by some workers in the field . in auroral and radiation belt physics",
    "it has been known and applied for much longer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the essence of this theorem is that in such systems a charged particle is effectively forever tied , in a sense which we will define later , to the same magnetic line of force , except for motion along the ignorable coordinate , or for the case of a magnetic field entirely aligned in the ignorable direction .",
    "cross - field motion is expected in many real , three - dimensional systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "this constraint on particle motion represents a critical loss of physics in many situations in which the ignorability of the coordinate is an artifact of the analysis rather than a property of the real system . since jkg presented the theorem in a heuristic manner , and , because it appears that its implication has not been always understood or believed , in the present paper we present a rigorous derivation of the theorem and include an expanded discussion of its implications .    the most salient application of the theorem concerns one- and two - dimensional hybrid and full plasma simulations , which have been employed by numerous researchers to study particle acceleration in collisionless shocks .",
    "a general conclusion of these investigations is that while the simulations can generate substantial non - thermal populations of particles in quasi - parallel shock systems , none have been able to demonstrate any significant acceleration of a stochastic nature of ions and electrons in quasi - perpendicular shock environments .",
    "hybrid simulations that model the quasi - parallel portion of the earth s bow shock ( trattner & scholer 1991 , scholer , trattner & kucharek 1992 ) produced nice comparisons with ampte suprathermal ion observations , following hard on the heels of the successful modeling of this data by ellison , mbius and paschmann ( 1990 ) using a monte carlo technique to describe particle convection and diffusion .",
    "in contrast , highly oblique and quasi - perpendicular hybrid simulation models of the acceleration of interstellar pick up ions at the heliospheric termination shock ( e.g. liewer , goldstein and omidi 1993 , kucharek and scholer 1995 , liewer , rath and goldstein 1995 ) fail to create any measurable non - thermal ions for field obliquities above around @xmath0 . for full plasma simulations , which have had only very limited application to shock acceleration problems ,",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "it has been concluded by such studies ( @xcite ) that perpendicular relativistic electron - positron shocks , such as would occur in pulsar wind termination shocks , are incapable of accelerating the ambient particles to non - thermal energies .",
    "this situation is modified slightly by the inclusion of a proton component ( hoshino et al .",
    "1992 ) that spawns magnetosonic waves that can provide limited ( second order stochastic ) acceleration of positrons only .",
    "we suggest that , in light of the following discussion , such results may be viewed as the consequence of the reduced dimensionality and the concomitant loss of cross field diffusion .",
    "the theorem states that for a system of electromagnetic fields that have at least one ignorable coordinate the corresponding component of canonical momentum is conserved .",
    "the conservation of this component can have serious implications for the allowed motions of particles in such a field system _ e.g. _ binding a particle to a given _ field line equivalence class _ ( flec ) which is defined to be the class of all magnetic field lines that differ only by translation along the ignorable coordinate ( or a rotation if the ignorable coordinate is an angle variable ) .    in the appendix",
    "we show that if the electromagnetic _ fields _ do not depend on at least one coordinate , say @xmath1 , in some orthogonal ( not necessarily cartesian ) coordinate system , then a particular gauge can be found in which the vector and scalar potentials , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , also do not depend on this coordinate .",
    "furthermore , insofar as the component @xmath4 is concerned , this gauge is unique up to an overall constant in space and time .",
    "this implies that the hamiltonian of a particle in such a field will have @xmath1 as an ignorable coordinate .",
    "we will also show in section [ equivalence ] that the scaled component of the vector potential , @xmath5 ( a scale factor , @xmath6 , converts a generalized orthogonal coordinate , @xmath7 , into conventional length units such as centimeters ) in the ignorable direction is a constant along a magnetic field line ( as well as along the @xmath1 coordinate ) and thus may be used as a label for a given flec where a field line equivalence class is defined as all field lines that differ only in their @xmath1 coordinate _ i.e. _ a surface generated by moving a field line through all values of the coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "we will also show that a physically meaningful magnetic field line motion may be defined .",
    "this motion reduces to the usual convection of field lines for ideal hydromagnetic systems and can not be due to a simple gauge relabeling since no remaining gauge transformations that preserve the symmetry can change the value of @xmath5 .",
    "we will also show in section [ binding ] that the physical scale of this binding is of the order of the harmonic mean of the particle s gyroradius in this field region .",
    "since we have shown that with our choice of gauge nothing depends on the @xmath1 coordinate we may establish an equivalence class of all field lines that differ only in their @xmath1 coordinate . further , from the definition of @xmath8 , and the fact that @xmath9 , we may take the @xmath10 component of @xmath11 and obtain @xmath12 and @xmath5 is constant along a magnetic field line .",
    "this means that we may _ identify _ a field line ( or rather its equivalence class ) by its value of @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , if , at a later time , the flec with this value of @xmath5 is found at a different spatial position we may _ define _ this motion as a field line motion knowing that this motion is uniquely determined by the physics because there is no remaining time dependent gauge freedom that changes the value of @xmath4 .    employing the electric and magnetic fields we define the velocity @xmath13   & & \\\\[-5.5pt ]      & = & -{\\partial ( h_2a_2 ) \\over \\partial t}{\\vec \\nabla ( h_2a_2 ) \\over           ( \\vec \\nabla ( h_2a_2))^2}\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unit vectors in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions , respectively , it is easy to see that @xmath18 satisfies @xmath19 and may , therefore , be regarded as the velocity , perpendicular to the @xmath1 direction , of the field lines equivalence class , defined by their value of @xmath5 .",
    "it is also clear that this velocity is identical to the @xmath20 drift velocity whenever @xmath21 .      from this point",
    "the argument is nearly the same as jkg , and it is straightforward to see that a particle is `` bound '' in some sense to a particular value of @xmath5 and hence to a field line . since @xmath1 is an ignorable coordinate the @xmath1 component of the canonical momentum is conserved ( @xcite ) , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 where @xmath25/2 $ ] . in situations",
    "where the particles energy and hence @xmath26 do not change this defines a flux tube , in which the particle is constrained to remain .    to obtain an estimate of the spatial scale of this flux tube",
    "consider a curve , @xmath27 , in the @xmath28 plane , from the field line with the minimum value of @xmath5 to the one with the maximum value , that is everywhere perpendicular to the field @xmath29 where @xmath30 along the curve @xmath27 .",
    "we have then @xmath31    & & \\qquad = \\ ; \\int_sdx_1~{\\partial ( h_2a_2)\\over\\partial x_1 }            + \\int_sdx_3~{\\partial ( h_2a_2)\\over\\partial x_3 } \\\\[3pt ]    & & \\qquad = \\ ; -\\int_s ( h_2d\\vec s \\times \\vec b^\\prime)_2             \\;\\geq\\ ; ( h_2)_{\\rm min}\\int_s ds~|b^\\prime|\\nonumber   \\label{integral1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] employing equation ( [ curve_curl ] ) . since the absolute value of this integral @xmath32 we may divide equation ( [ integral1 ] ) by this quantity to obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the local gyroradius of a particle due to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 components of the magnetic field . a particle , therefore , moves a distance perpendicular to the @xmath28 component of the order of the harmonic mean of its gyroradius in this field along this path .",
    "clearly , the electromagnetic fields may be arbitrary , consistent with maxwell s equations and reduced dimensionality .",
    "it should be noted , however , that if @xmath8 lies entirely in the @xmath1 direction over a region of space , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are zero and @xmath37 . there is , therefore , no restriction , imposed by the theorem , on particle motion in this region .",
    "the theorem established in the previous section makes it clear that a full discussion of any problem involving charged particles and electromagnetic fields must either be done in three dimensions or the effects of reduced dimensionality must be shown to be irrelevant to the problem at hand .",
    "this has important consequences for a number of problems , including the physics of collisionless plasmas and cosmic - ray transport .",
    "we consider briefly some specific applications involving both physically real and artificially constrained symmetries .",
    "we will begin by considering a case in which an identifiable symmetry reflects ( at least approximately ) a _ real _ property of the system .",
    "it has been known for many years that the particles trapped in the geomagnetic field ( the van allen belts ) drift around the earth in such a way as to approximately conserve the `` l '' parameter .",
    "this parameter is essentially a label for the flec generated by the rotational symmetry of the dipole field .",
    "since this symmetry is broken in many ways ( the dipole is tilted with respect to the earth s rotation axis and many perturbations of the field , both time dependant and static , do not preserve this symmetry ) the conservation is only approximate but is good enough to be a useful concept in space physics .",
    "furthermore the entire concept of trapped ( radiation belts ) and excluded particles ( cosmic - ray geomagnetic cutoff ) was discussed by strmer ( @xcite ) in terms of the `` second first integral '' of the motion , which is clearly the azimuthal component of the canonical momentum .",
    "in addition , the motion of the particles in the remaining degrees of freedom can often be understood by viewing the conserved momentum in the hamiltonian as part of a potential function ( stern 1975 ) .",
    "in such a case , the actual symmetry of the system aids in the understanding of particle dynamics .",
    "previous discussions of cosmic - ray transport using the quasi - linear approximation ( @xcite ) often assumed irregularities which depended only on one coordinate ( slab turbulence ) .",
    "in such geometries the field - line mixing , or random walk was the _ only _ contribution to motion normal to the average magnetic field . yet",
    ", other studies of phenomenological particle scattering in a magnetic field ( ) showed that cross field diffusion should occur .",
    "it is now clear that the reduced dimensionality of the slab model , not the quasi - linear approximation , guaranteed this result and since real turbulence is usually three dimensional in nature ( ) this limitation is probably not real , although the field line mixing probably plays an important role .",
    "recently giacalone and jokipii ( 1994 ) considered a number of issues in the general problem of cosmic - ray transport and its relation to the dimensionality of magnetic - field fluctuations . using synthesized magnetic - field turbulence having a specific power spectrum",
    ", they directly verified that particles can not cross field lines if the spectrum does not depend on all three spatial variables .",
    "however , when the turbulence was allowed to be fully three dimensional , cross field diffusion of the particles was evident .",
    "this has profound implications for simulations of particle acceleration by collisionless shocks .      as discussed in the introduction",
    ", both hybrid and full particle one- and two - dimensional simulations do not predict any populations of ions accelerated to highly suprathermal energies in quasi - perpendicular shocks , this provides a major problem for these approaches : they are in direct conflict with ubiquitous observations of such populations near highly oblique traveling interplanetary shocks ( e.g. baring et al . 1997 ) , and the general consensus that the anomalous cosmic ray populations result from the acceleration of pick - up ions at the solar wind termination shock ( e.g. pesses , jokipii & eichler 1981 ) .",
    "the discussion of jkg pointed out that the important problem of charged - particle acceleration at quasi - perpendicular collisionless shocks could not be properly studied using one- or two - dimensional hybrid simulations .",
    "this is because cross - field motion plays a crucial role .",
    "the restrictions for the acceleration at a purely perpendicular shock are particular severe . here",
    "the magnetic field is carried downstream at the post - shock flow speed .",
    "if the particles are to remain tied to a magnetic field line , as required by the theorem , any acceleration at the shock would have to be fast enough for the particle gyro - radius to increase as fast as the distance of the magnetic field line downstream .",
    "otherwise the particle would have to be convected downstream with the fluid , preventing any further acceleration .",
    "it is readily shown that the ordinary gradient drift along the shock face is too slow to effect the required increase in the gyroradius ; however , see the discussion in section [ surfing ] .",
    "hence significant particle acceleration depends critically on the charged particles being able to scatter and diffuse across the magnetic field , so that they may continue interacting with the shock .",
    "this necessary motion is artificially suppressed in simulations of reduced dimensions .",
    "therefore one would incorrectly infer that significant acceleration can not occur in such quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "the situation in oblique shocks is not so severe since particles may be able to follow field lines to continue interacting with the shock .",
    "but in such cases the quantitative character of the results will be affected because the cross - field transport is still important for efficient injection .",
    "furthermore , simulations of _ quasi - parallel _ shocks , where it has been noted that acceleration occurs by drifting along a transverse fluctuation in the magnetic field ( @xcite ) , should also be re - examined using three - dimensional simulations . in fact , kucharek , fujimoto & scholer ( 1993 ) demonstrated that significant changes are incurred in quasi - parallel shock simulations in going from one - dimensional to two - dimensional constructions .",
    "as examples of situations in which the conservation of the canonical momentum component does _ not _ prevent particle acceleration we examine two cases where this conservation can actually _ cause _ the acceleration .",
    "there exist situations in which a charged particle is prevented from remaining near to the flec on which it was once found .",
    "this can arise because the flec ceases to exist ( field line merging ) or a strong electric field temporarily prevents the particle from following the field line motion ( shock surfing ) .",
    "for the first example consider a planar current sheet in the @xmath38 plane which separates two regions of oppositely - directed magnetic field , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "we can choose @xmath41 so that field lines that are equidistant from the neutral sheet but on opposite sides ( therefore of opposite sign ) will have the same value of @xmath42 .",
    "a given particle in the vicinity of this neutral sheet could range a further distance in @xmath43 than it could if the field did not change sign but must still maintain the constancy of the quantity @xmath44 .    if now , as shown in figure [ merge ] , the regions of oppositely directed fields are allowed to merge and annihilate field through plasma processes , which we do not discuss here , the value of @xmath42 will everywhere continuously increase due to the constant loss of the smallest values in the vicinity of @xmath45 . in order to preserve the invariant value of @xmath44 , the value of @xmath46 must continuously increase . thus @xmath47 must continuously increase and the particle must be accelerated by the annihilating fields .",
    "ambrosiano , et al .",
    "( @xcite ) employ an argument similar to the above in a discussion of particle acceleration .",
    "1.0truecm    -0.2truecm    -0.6truecm    in a study of plasma shocks with a cross shock electric potential drop it has been shown ( @xcite ) that some particles that are incident on the shock front will not have enough kinetic energy to overcome this potential and thus can not cross the shock because the sign of the potential drop is always in the direction to retard the incoming ions ( @xcite ) . once again , if there is an ignorable direction perpendicular to the magnetic field the particle must remain within a gyroradius or so of it s original flec , which is proceeding through the shock front without the particle .",
    "the only way this can occur is for the particle s gyroradius to increase as fast as the field lines move downstream .",
    "this process , called shock surfing because the particle skims along the shock surface along the ignorable direction , continues until the particle gains sufficient energy to overcome the cross shock potential .",
    "since both of these mechanisms depend rather strongly on there being no variation of the electric and magnetic fields in the ignorable direction any perturbation that does not have that symmetry can `` derail '' the process and limit the energy gain to one considerably less than the theoretical limit based on that symmetry .",
    "therefore , once again , theoretical investigations of these processes should allow for variations in three dimensions to determine the true limits on their effectiveness as accelerating mechanisms .",
    "in this paper we have provided a rigorous proof of the jkg theorem and emphasized that the most important application of the theorem is that the assumption of reduced dimensionality often used in modeling charged - particle motion has severe effects on the validity of the conclusions which may be drawn . in particular , any processes which may depend on particle motion across the magnetic field can not in principle occur .",
    "this therefore casts doubt on those models or simulations which are complex enough that the contribution of cross - field motion can not be independently assessed . in such cases the only recourse is to do a fully three - dimensional model",
