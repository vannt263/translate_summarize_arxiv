    "since shapley s pioneering work @xcite , globular clusters ( gcs ) have played a key - role in our understanding of the universe and of the manner in which our galaxy formed : in the milky way they are the oldest stellar systems found , with ages in the range @xmath3 to @xmath4 gyr , so to represent tracers of the early formation history of the galaxy .",
    "+ they are the best systems to study stellar dynamics , having relaxation times smaller than their age , so that , at least in the core , stars are expected to have lost memory of their initial conditions @xcite . in the early 1980s a number of approximated numerical studies of spherical self - gravitating systems @xcite showed that the central density tends to increase dramatically over the time , so that ultimately a central power - law cusp is produced in the central region , even if these systems have an early evolutionary phase that resembles the king sequence of cluster models @xcite .",
    "together with the slow collapse of the core , star evaporation occurs : the approach to equipartition implies that the more massive stars sink toward the center of the cluster , while lighter stars expand their orbit .",
    "core collapse can be halted by the presence of hard binaries which , acting as energy sources , heat the central core by 3-bodies encounters @xcite . +",
    "internal processes are not the only responsible of dynamical evolution in these systems : perturbations due to an external field ( in particular , shocks due to the passage through the galactic disk and to the interaction with the bulge ) can accelerate significantly the evolution of a globular cluster . indeed , it is commonly accepted that the present globular cluster population represents the survivor of an initially more numerous one , depauperated by many disruptive processes @xcite .",
    "+ there is observational evidence that the globular cluster system ( gcs ) radial profile is less peaked than that of halo stars in our galaxy , m31 @xcite , m87 and m49 @xcite , as well as in three galaxies of the fornax cluster @xcite and of 11 elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "this fact leads to the hypothesis @xcite that the two systems ( halo and gcs ) originally had the same profile and that , afterwards , the gcs evolved mainly due to two complementary effects : tidal interaction with the galactic field ( which causes less concentrated clusters to disintegrate more rapidly ) and dynamical friction ( which induces massive globular clusters to decay in the central galactic region in less than @xmath5 years , see @xcite ) .",
    "external tidal fields have the effect of inducing the evolution of the shape of the mass function of individual clusters , because of the preferential depletion of low - mass stars @xcite as a consequence of two - body relaxation .",
    "strong evidence that the tidal field plays a fundamental role in the evolution of mass functions was achieved by the discovery that their slopes correlate more strongly with the cluster location in the milky way than with the cluster metallicity @xcite .",
    "+ in the last decade , many observational evidences of the interaction of gcs with the tidal field have been found .",
    "firstly , @xcite , using colour - magnitude selected star counts in a dozen of galactic gcs , showed that in the outer parts of these clusters the stellar surface density profiles exceeded the prediction of king models , extending also outside the tidal radius of the corresponding king model .",
    "other results confirmed grillmair s findings @xcite ; all these works suggest that many gcs are likely surrounded by haloes or tails , made up of stars which were tidally stripped from the system .",
    "this was the state of the art until the spectacular findings of two tidal tails emanating from the outer part of the palomar 5 globular cluster and covering an arc of 10 degrees on the sky , corresponding to a projected lenght of @xmath6 kpc at the distance of the cluster @xcite , obtained in the framework of the sloan digital sky survey project ( see also _ http://www.sdss.org_ ) .",
    "+ one of the relevant observational features of palomar 5 is the presence of well defined clumps in the star distribution along the tails @xcite . also ngc 6254 and palomar 12 seem to show clumpy structures in their tails @xcite . this still deserves an exaustive interpretation .",
    "actually , the simulations of @xcite show the presence of small clumps ( containing about @xmath7 of the total number of stars of the cluster ) in the tidal tails .",
    "the authors attribute the formation of these clumps to strong gravitational shocks suffered by the cluster . on another hand ,",
    "@xcite were not able to reproduce the clumps observed in the tails of pal 5 , even adopting a realistic galactic model , so that they argued that these structures could be due to the effect of galactic sub - structures not accounted in their simulations ( giant molecular clouds , spiral arms , dark - matter sub - halos or massive compact halo objects ) .    with the aim of understanding",
    "better the mechanism of interaction of gcs with the external field , in particular with the bulge , and to investigate on the presence of clumps in tidal tails , we performed numerical simulations of globular clusters in orbit in a triaxial galaxy , aiming also at clarifying the morphological connection between the clusters tidal tails and their orbits .",
    "+ in the next sections we show the results for globular clusters on loop orbits in an inner region of a triaxial galaxy . in particular , in sect.[numericalmethods ] , an overview of the numerical methods adopted to perform the simulation are discussed ; in sect.[cluster ] the galaxy and cluster model adopted are presented ; in sect.[results1 ] and sect.[results2 ] we deal with the main results of our work , especially that concerning the formation of tidal tails around the cluster and their orientation respect to the cluster orbit ( sect.[tidal ] ) , the radial density profiles of the cluster , as they evolve with time , and the presence of clumpy regions in the tails ( sect.[density ] ) , the velocity dispersion of stars in the cluster ( sect.[vel ] ) , the estimate of the mass loss rate ( sect.[loss ] ) and the evolution of the global mass functions ( sect.[massf ] ) ; in the last section all the findings are summarized and discussed .",
    "all the simulations were performed by means of an implementation of a _ tree - code _ carried out mainly by one of the authors ( p.m. ) .",
    "it is based on the algorithm described in @xcite and adopts multipolar expansions of the potential truncated at the quadrupole moment .",
    "it was parallelized to run on high performance computers via mpi routines , employing an original parallelization approach @xcite .",
    "the time - integration of the ` particles ' trajectories is performed by a 2@xmath8 order leap - frog algorithm .",
    "this latter uses individual and variable time - steps according to the block - time scheme @xcite , in addition with corrections implemented in order to keep the same order of approximation also during the time - step change .",
    "the maximum time - step allowed is @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the core - crossing time of the gc , being @xmath11 its mass and @xmath12 the core radius ) , while the minimum is @xmath13 , thus fastest particles may have a time - step as small as @xmath14 .",
    "the best criterion we found for choosing the time - step of the @xmath15-th particle is via the formula : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the velocity of the particle relative to its first neighbour , @xmath18 the distance from its first neighbour and @xmath19 the modulus of the acceleration . to avoid instability in the time - integration , we smoothed the @xmath20 interaction potential by substiuting @xmath20 with a continuous @xmath21-spline function that gives an exactly newtonian potential for @xmath22 and a force that vanishes for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in all the runs we set @xmath24 , so to have @xmath25 .",
    "note that such value of @xmath26 is much less than the typical interparticle distance .",

    "+ following @xcite , we will consider @xmath47 m@xmath48 and @xmath49 pc , but the results obtained in adimensional variables ( see appendix [ scal ] ) are scalable in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath40 , for given initial conditions for positions , velocities and @xmath50 .",
    "as initial cluster model , we chose a multimass king distribution @xcite , with @xmath51 mass classes , ranging between @xmath52 and @xmath53m@xmath48 and equally spaced in a logarithmic scale . to find the distribution function for each mass class , we integrated the poisson s equation as described in the appendix [ kingmod ] .",
    "+ the initial cluster mass function is chosen in the salpeter form @xcite , i.e. @xmath54 ( see appendix [ remn ] for a discussion about the remnants of progenitor stars more massive than @xmath55 ) .",
    "we included mass segregation in the initial conditions of our cluster model because we wanted to simulate a dynamically - relaxed cluster ( supposed to be sufficiently massive to have frictionally decayed in the central galactic region ) .",
    "the `` initial '' mass of the system is @xmath56 m@xmath57 , the initial concentration parameter is @xmath58 and the central velocity dispersion is @xmath59 km s@xmath60 , being @xmath61 the bulge crossing time .",
    "+ then , the system was represented by a number ( @xmath62 ) of ` particles ' lower than the number of stars in the real cluster , with masses properly rescaled such to give a total mass equal to @xmath63 .",
    "the cluster moves on the y - z coordinate plane , following loop orbits of different ellipticity @xmath64 being @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , the apocenter and pericenter distances ( see table [ tbl-1 ] for orbital parameters ) .",
    "in the following , we present the main findings of our work concerning with tidal tails structure and evolution . when we refer to the center - of - density of the cluster , we mean a mass density - weighted center as defined by @xcite .      in all the simulations performed , the cluster starts moving around the galaxy center in a clockwise direction ( seen from the positive x axis ) .",
    "the different loop orbits have been followed for about 30 @xmath67 .",
    "+ in fig.[orb1 ] , [ orb2 ] , [ orb3 ] , [ orb4 ] , [ orb5 ] , [ orb6 ] , [ orb7 ] and [ orb8 ] , the formation and subsequent development of tails around the globular cluster is shown .",
    "+ after about 8 @xmath67 , tidal tails are clearly formed .",
    "they continuosly accrete by stars leaving the cluster , so that after 30 @xmath67 , in the case of quasi - circular orbit ( @xmath68 ) , they are elongated for more than 3 @xmath30 each and contain about @xmath69 of the initial cluster mass .",
    "as it is clearly visible from these figures , the degree of elongation of the tails along the cluster orbital path strongly depends on the ellipticity @xmath70 ( eq.[ell ] ) of the cluster orbit . indeed , while in the case of the quasi - circular orbit tails are a clear tracer of the cluster path , in the most eccentric orbit ( @xmath71 ) , tails are strictly elongated along the orbital path only when the cluster is near the perigalacticon , while at the apogalacticon they tend to deviate from the cluster path .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite a remarkable tails  orbit alignment is found for clusters moving on quasi ",
    "radial orbits in the same bulge potential .",
    "however , it is important to stress that , in order to perform accurate predictions of the cluster orbit from observational detections of tidal tails , it is necessary to look at the spatial distribution of stars well outside the cluster ( typically @xmath72 times the cluster limiting radius ) . indeed , in the vicinity of the globular cluster , stars in the tails are not aligned with the cluster orbit , neither in the case of small ellipticity ( see fig.[zoom ] ) , but they distribute along the peculiar @xmath73shape profile not aligned along the orbit .",
    "+ the orbit ellipticity also influences the similarity between the two cluster tails . for the quasi - circular orbit ,",
    "these structures are simmetric for the whole duration of the simulation , being elongated , at a given time , for the same length . for more eccentric orbits",
    ", the leading tail tends to be more elongated than the trailing one when going from the apocenter to the orbital pericenter and , viceversa , it is less elongated than the trailing tail when the cluster moves towards the apocenter . in any case , the tail that precedes the cluster extends always slightly below the orbit while the trailing one lies slighlty above this latter , in agreement with what observed for palomar 5 .",
    "+ the shape and orientation of the tails can be easily understood in the case of a cluster moving on a circular orbit in an axysimmetric external field , using a rotating frame of reference with the origin in the baricentre of the cluster , with the @xmath74-axis pointing towards the galactic center , the @xmath75-axis parallel to the direction of motion of the cluster and the @xmath76-axis orthogonal to the orbital plane . in this reference frame , the galactic tidal field tends to accelerate stars along the @xmath77 directions @xcite , making stars to escape from the system through the lagrangian points @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( which are the two equilibrium points located along the @xmath74-axis ) .",
    "but the coriolis acceleration tends to align escaping stars along the direction of motion of the cluster around the galaxy , this yelding the peculiar @xmath80-shape just outside the cluster , in the inner part of the tails .",
    "+      in order to describe the tidal debris and to compare our findings with observations @xcite , we studied the radial profile of the volume and surface densities ( azimutally averaged ) as a function of the distance from the cluster center . obviously , this description does not take into account the fact that stars lost from the cluster are not placed in a spherically symmetric structure , but it has the advantage to provide a global study of both the cluster and the tails that can be easily compared with observational data . in fig.[voldens ] and [ voldenstutte ] , the volume density of the system is shown at different epochs , for the various orbits . once the tails have completely developed , outside the _ s_-shape distribution , density clumps appears .",
    "they are symmetrically located in the two tails , as shown in fig.[supdens2 ] for the cluster on quasi - circular orbit : in this case , the most prominent clumps are located at a distance from the cluster center between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the density profiles are very similar to that of palomar 5 , where clumps are visible in the outer part of the cluster @xcite .",
    "+ of course , the possibility to detect observationally these clumps is strongly related to the cluster position along its orbit .",
    "indeed , we computed the contrast density ratio @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the local volume density in the clumps and @xmath85 is the background ( i.e. the bulge ) density around them .",
    "this ratio is maximum when the cluster is near apogalacticon and decreases when moving towards perigalacticon , as shown in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "this is due to two complementary effects : when the cluster is near apogalacticon , @xmath85 is minimum ( according to the galaxy model described in sect.[galaxy ] ) and , at the same time , the elongation of the tails tends to compress respect to that at perigalacticon ( see , for example , fig.[orb7 ] and fig.[orb8 ] ) and so @xmath84 increases .",
    "if completely detectable , clumps can contain about @xmath0 each ( i.e. about @xmath1 of the cluster mass at that epoch ) , as in the case of the cluster moving on the quasi - circular orbit after @xmath86 .",
    "+ in order to study the mass distribution along the tails , we have also evaluated the `` linear '' density for the whole system in the quasi - circular orbit around the galaxy .",
    "this study is particularly well fitted to investigate the mass distribution because tails form a long and thin structure .",
    "the upper panel of fig.[teta ] shows the linear mass density as a function of the curvilinear abscissa @xmath87 along the system : the absolute maximum in the plot corresponds to the cluster location , while the two simmetric relative maxima correspond to the two main clumps .",
    "these clumps result to be unbound structures ( see also @xcite ) ; we followed the motion of stars that at a certain time stay in the two clumps : they crowd in the clumps for some time and then move away in the outer parts of the tails .",
    "once moved away from clumps , these stars tend to disperse along the cluster tails .",
    "also the simmetric location of these two clumps respect to the cluster center makes improbable that these structures can be due to local disomogenities in the gravitational field along the tails .",
    "more probably , these clumps are related to cinematical properties of stars in their surroundings .",
    "the bottom panel in fig.[teta ] shows the derivative of the stellar tangential velocity component with respect to the curvilinear abscissa @xmath87 defined above .",
    "as is evident , the two clumps correspond to a region where this derivative has a negative minimum , which is also the global minimum over the whole extension of the tails .",
    "this implies that the local velocity of the stars decreases as they are approaching the clumps , thus leading to the local overdensity which originates such structures .",
    "however , the mechanism at the basis of the formation of these structures still requires further and more detailed investigationsd that we postpone to next papers .",
    "see , however , the discussion in @xcite for the case of clusters in quasi  radial orbits .",
    "for the two galactic globular clusters m15 and @xmath2 centauri there are observational evidences that the stellar velocity dispersion remains constant at large radii @xcite .",
    "+ three hypotheses have been raised to justify these findings : 1 ) tidal heating , as suggested by drukier for m15 @xcite ; 2 ) the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the clusters @xcite ; 3 ) a breakdown of newton s law of gravity in the weak acceleration regime @xcite . + we studied the velocity dispersion profile of our simulated cluster as it would be detected if the system was seen along a line - of - sight perpendicular to the cluster orbital plane . in fig.[vlos ] ,",
    "line - of - sight velocities of members of the cluster are plotted versus distance from the center , at four different epochs . at @xmath88 ,",
    "the velocities decrease moving from the center of the cluster outwards , as it is expected from a king model with a tidal cutoff .",
    "as the system moves through the galaxy and loses stars , the velocity profile varies significantly : it tends to decrease until a limiting value and then increases again .",
    "this behaviour is very similar to that found in m15 ( cfr fig.8 in drukier et al .",
    "+ in fig.[disp ] the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile is shown .",
    "it is evident from the figure that in the outer part of the cluster , the dispersion tends to level off .",
    "this region corresponds to that characterized by a power - law volume density profile ( see fig.[voldens ] and [ voldenstutte ] ) .",
    "stars in this region are escaping from the system and their motion is mostly oriented along the radial direction towards the galaxy center .",
    "once escaped , they move around the galaxy weakly interacting with each other , with similar orbital parameters , so that the velocity dispersion found is coherent with that of a set of particles moving in the triaxial potential adopted .",
    "+ the second relevant finding is the decreasing of the velocity dispersion in the inner part of the cluster , which could be explained by the quick revirialization of the inner part as stellar mass is being lost .",
    "this in accordance with the very low velocity dispersion of pal5 @xcite , a cluster which has suffered a great mass loss , as it is now well estabilished .",
    "to estimate the mass loss from the cluster , we decided to use an ` observational ' definition . at",
    "any given time we compare the cluster local density @xmath89 with the background stellar density @xmath85 , assuming that a star is actually belonging to the cluster if it is located in a region dense enough to make it distinguishable from the background , i.e. if @xmath90 being @xmath91    the limiting radius @xmath92 is then defined as the radius of the sphere ( centered in the cluster density center ) in which the cluster ` emerges ' from the stellar background . in fig.[mloss ] , the evolution of the cluster mass , expressed in units of the initial mass @xmath93 , is shown versus time for all the four simulations performed .",
    "+ in the case of a cluster moving on orbits with apocenter @xmath94 , the mass loss is dramatic : after about 30 @xmath67 the cluster loses about 75@xmath95 of its mass ; the best fit of the mass evolution as a function of time is given by : + @xmath96 where @xmath97 is expressed in units of the bulge crossing time @xmath98 . in the remaining case ,",
    "when the orbit extends up to 7.5 @xmath30 , the mass loss rate considerably diminishes and the cluster mass , after 30 @xmath67 , is still about 60@xmath95 of its initial value . as is evident in fig.[mloss ] , in this case the mass loss rate increases every time the cluster passes at the minimum distance from the galaxy center and not all particles which become unbound at perigalacticon are still so while moving again to apogalacticon .",
    "it is possible to point out a region around the galaxy center inside which the cluster suffers more of mass loss : in our case ( cluster concentration equal to 1.1 ) this region corresponds roughly to @xmath994 @xmath30 .",
    "this conclusion is accordance to what found in @xcite , where great mass loss occurs for clusters with comparable central density moving on quasi ",
    "radial orbits within such region .",
    "+ finally , we want to stress that the choice of performing some of the simulations with a reduced number of particles ( @xmath100 ) did not affect the mass loss rate over the time interval of 30 @xmath67 .",
    "actually , fig.[mloss ] clearly shows that , for the cluster in a quasi - circular orbit , the mass loss rate is the same using either @xmath101 ( solid line ) or a ten times smaller @xmath62 ( dashed line ) .      as explained in sect.[cluster1 ] , we adopted mass segregation in the globular cluster initial conditions , for we aim at simulating a dinamically evolved cluster , whose orbit had decayed in the inner galactic region due to dynamical friction .",
    "as the cluster begins to lose stars , the distribution of stars of different masses in the system starts evolving .",
    "this is shown in the left column of fig.[msegreg - mgc ] , where the mean mass of stars populating three different spatial regions versus time is plotted .",
    "the first region corresponds to the sphere with radius @xmath102 ( corresponding to @xmath103 pc , with our choice of @xmath40 and @xmath30 ) centered on the cluster , which initially contains @xmath104 of the total mass of the system ; the second region is the spherical shell with inner and outer radius @xmath102 and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 pc ) , which initially contains @xmath107 of the cluster mass ; the third region is that outside @xmath105 .",
    "as time passes by , low mass stars begin to escape from the system , and the mean stellar mass in the two inner regions starts to rise , while the external one remains quite constant .",
    "the increasing of the mean stellar mass versus time in the central cluster regions is particularly evident in the case of the quasi - circular orbit and of the loop with ellipticity @xmath108 , because of the greater mass loss in these two cases . plotting the mean stellar mass in the three regions defined above as a function of the fraction of mass lost , we see ( fig.[msegreg - mgc ] , right column ) that the evolution of the mean mass depends mostly on the fraction of mass lost from the system rather than on the number of stars populating the cluster and on the cluster orbital path .",
    "+ the differential mass loss obviously influences the shape of the mass function at different times . in fig.[fmassatot ] the mass function of stars belonging to the cluster is shown at three different epochs , when the cluster has lost respectively the @xmath109 , the @xmath110 and the @xmath69 of its initial mass .",
    "as the cluster loses stars in the galactic field , the mass function evolves towards flatter configurations , because of the preferential loss of low - mass stars , that , accordingly to the initial mass segregation , are located mostly in the external regions of the cluster .",
    "the evolution of the mass function appears to be driven by the fraction of mass loss , rather than by other parameters ( like the total number of stars in the system and the orbital type of the parent cluster ) confirming the findings of @xcite .",
    "this is evident from the fact that , for a given fraction of mass lost , the curves found for the different orbits in practice coincide .",
    "the main results of our work may be resumed as follows :    1 .",
    "stars are lost from the system along a direction which results from the composition of the direction towards the galactic center and the cluster velocity around the galaxy , thus leading to the peculiar s - shape found in the outermost region of the cluster .",
    "once formed , tidal tails are elongated such to remain parallel to the cluster orbit , with a trailing tail that lies slightly inside the orbit and a leading tail slightly outside it .",
    "tails are excellent tracers of the cluster orbit near the pericenter , while , at the apocenter , they tend to deviate from the orbital path .",
    "tidal tails have a clumpy structure which can not be associated with an episodic mass loss or tidal shocks with galactic compact sub - structures , since stars are lost from the cluster continuously and since the interaction with the bulge is not episodic . these clumps are not bound self - gravitating systems , they are rather due to a local deceleration of the motion of the stars along the tails .",
    "the observational evidence found for m15 and @xmath2 centauri that the velocity dispersion increases and then remains constant at large radii is explained in terms of the so  called ` tidal heating ' : the stars that evaporate outside the tidal radius of the cluster undergo mainly the interaction with the external field , thus acquiring the higher velocity dispersion pertaining to that field .",

    "the gc we considered in our simulations is supposed to have an age of @xmath185 yr , thus only stars more massive than @xmath186 m@xmath187 are at that time evolved up to a compact remnant @xcite .",
