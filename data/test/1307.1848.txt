    "scale invariance is a well - known symmetry @xcite that has been studied in many physical contexts .",
    "a strong physical motivation for incorporating scale symmetry in fundamental physics @xcite@xcite@xcite comes from low energy particle physics .",
    "namely , the _ classical _ action of the standard model is already consistent with scale symmetry if the higgs mass term is dropped .",
    "this invites the idea , which many have considered , that the mass term may emerge from the vacuum expectation value of an additional scalar field @xmath0 in a fully scale invariant theory .",
    "another striking hint of scale symmetry occurs on cosmic scales : the ( nearly ) scale invariant spectrum of primordial fluctuations , as measured by wmap and the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "this amazing simplicity seems to cry out for an explanation in terms of a fundamental symmetry in nature , rather than as just the outcome of a scalar field evolving along some particular potential given some particular initial condition .    in this paper , we consider the incorporation into fundamental physics of _ local conformal symmetry _ ( or weyl - symmetry ) : that is , classical local scaling symmetry in an action that includes the standard model coupled to gravity .",
    "a new result of our approach @xcite-@xcite is that using conformal symmetry we are able to solve the classical frw equations across big crunch - big bang transitions , thus obtaining the _ full set of geodesically complete cosmological solutions _ of our conformal standard model given in eq.([action1 ] ) .",
    "this follows from the new properties of the standard theory whose couplings to gravity includes _ all patches of field space _ that are required for geodesic completeness of all cosmological solutions for all times and any set of initial conditions ) as described in section ( [ confcosm ] ) . ] .",
    "the models we describe contain no mass scales  no gravitational constant , no mass for the higgs field , no cosmological constant and no mass parameters for the quarks , leptons or gauge bosons .",
    "all of these are prevented by the local conformal symmetry combined with the su@xmath1su@xmath2u@xmath3 gauge symmetry of the standard model .",
    "there is only one source of mass which follows from gauge fixing ( in some sense spontaneously breaking ) the weyl symmetry through a scalar field which is a singlet under su@xmath1su@xmath4u@xmath3 or a combination of both su@xmath5su@xmath6u@xmath3 singlet and non - singlet fields , depending on the choice of gauge .",
    "this source , which is associated with the emergence of the planck scale , drives the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry , which in turn generates the other known masses of elementary constituents , with ratios of masses related to dimensionless constants .",
    "our approach to conformal symmetry has new features with significant physical consequences that were not considered before . while we shall work in @xmath7 dimensions throughout",
    ", there is a close connection with field theories and gravity or supergravity in @xmath8 dimensions in the context of 2t - physics @xcite-@xcite as will be pointed out occasionally throughout this paper .",
    "stated directly in @xmath7 dimensions , some of the novel features and their consequences are as follows :    * in section ( [ general ] ) we provide the most general form of coupling gravity or supergravity with any number of scalar fields , fermions and gauge bosons , while maintaining local conformal symmetry .",
    "only a specialized form of our general formalism in section ( [ general ] ) coincides with previously known methods for local conformal symmetry .",
    "we find that in a gauge symmetric theory , if there is only one physical scalar field ( for example , the higgs field ) _ after all gauge choices are exhausted _ , then there is a unique gauge - invariant and weyl - invariant form for the lagrangian representing the geodesically complete coupling to gravity . *",
    "the minimal , realistic and locally conformal standard model coupled to gravity includes the higgs doublet @xmath9 and an additional su@xmath10su@xmath11u@xmath12 singlet @xmath0 .",
    "taking into account all of the local symmetry , there is a single physical scalar field identifiable with the observed higgs field .",
    "therefore , according to the statement above , this is a geodesically complete conformal standad model provided it utilizes our unique coupling to gravity as shown in eq.([action1 ] ) and as proven in section ( [ generalgrav ] ) .",
    "the relative minus sign between @xmath13 and @xmath14 that appears in this action is obligatory and is related to geodesic completeness as will be explained later .",
    "the unique structure of local scale symmetry has led to full analytic control of cosmological solutions and , in certain limits , enabled us to obtain the complete set of homogeneous cosmological solutions for all possible initial conditions of the relevant fields .",
    "this is discussed in section ( [ confcosm ] ) . * in a particular gauge of the spontaneously broken local scale symmetry ( called @xmath15-gauge ) we recover the usual renormalizable field theory of the standard model in the flat space limit , including a mass scale for the higgs . in this gauge , low energy physics of our model",
    "coincides with the familiar form of the standard model unless more fields are included beyond those already observed , such as right handed neutrinos and dark matter which can be accommodated consistently with conformal symmetry following our methods .",
    "thus , low energy physics at lhc scales is not sensitive to the conformal structures suggested in our approach . * on the other hand , physics at cosmological scales can be quite sensitive to the conformal structures discussed in this paper as becomes apparent in certain gauges . in section ( [ confcosm ] )",
    "we outline some of the phenomena that follow from our unique conformal coupling . in the minimal conformal standard model of eq.([action1 ] ) , guided by our analytic solutions ( supplemented , where necessary , with numerical methods ) , we propose a _ cyclic conformal cosmology _ driven only by the higgs field with no recourse to other scalar fields such as an inflaton . the higgs - driven cosmological scenario we propose",
    "is strongly motivated by the metastability of the higgs vacuum as implied by the renormalization - group flow of the minimal standard model to large higgs vev , with its parameters fixed by the lhc measurements @xcite .",
    "the main discussion in this paper is at the classical field theory level , but it is worth commenting briefly on the important question of quantum corrections .",
    "there are two enormous hierarchies in the standard model coupled to gravity : the weak scale is around @xmath16 and the dark energy scale is around @xmath17 of the planck scale .",
    "it is hard to understand how such tiny numbers enter fundamental physics , and why quantum corrections would not spoil these fine tunings .    in both cases ,",
    "conformal symmetry has been suggested as a solution .",
    "we will not explore this here in any detail , except to note that the stability of such hierarchies in the perturbative standard model , which is what attracted attention in the past for the higgs field , should not be in jeopardy from quantum corrections since dimensionless constants in a conformal theory are logarithmically divergent as opposed to the quadratic divergence of a bare higgs mass term . to fully grasp",
    "how this can work at the quantum level for fundamental scalars and in particular the higgs , requires a better understanding of how to perform regularization and renormalization consistent with local conformal symmetry in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "elaborating on earlier suggestions @xcite@xcite@xcite , there has been recent progress @xcite in developing a renormalization theory consistent with weyl symmetry . according to this new work ,",
    "local conformal symmetry remains as a valid symmetry at the quantum level as anticipated in @xcite .",
    "the local scale invariance survives quantization even though there is a trace anomaly in the stress tensor of the matter sector of the theory ; this point that caused confusion in the past is clarified by noting that the trace of the _ matter _ stress tensor is _ distinct _ from the generator of local scale transformations that includes the additional fields , such as @xmath18 that implement and establish the local conformal symmetry . in passing , we note that if @xmath7 dimensional conformal symmetry is treated consistently within 2t - physics in @xmath8 dimensions , then scale ( dilation ) symmetry is a part of a _ linearly realized _",
    "so@xmath19 in the flat limit which is presumably not anomalous just as its lorentz subgroup so@xmath20 in @xmath7 dimensions can not be anomalous .",
    "this quantum aspect of 2t - physics is under investigation directly in @xmath8 dimensions and this is expected to shed additional light on these issues .",
    "a plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will review and expand on the motivation for global and local symmetry and show how to recast ( or lift ) the standard model plus gravity into a locally gauge invariant , weyl- symmetric theory by adding new fields and , at the same time , introducing compensating gauge symmetries , in such a way that the theory is _ both weyl invariant and geodesically complete_. the gauge fixed version of this theory reverts back to the familiar minimal form of the standard model at low energies wherever gravity is negligible .",
    "however , in regions of spacetime where strong gravity effects are important , such as in cosmology , especially close to the singularity , the geodesically complete weyl lifted version plays a crucial role , as described in sec .",
    "in section iii , following @xcite we present a general form for a lagrangian consistent with weyl symmetry for any number of scalar fields .",
    "we argue that , if the weyl invariant theory is equivalent to having only a single physical scalar field after gauge fixing ( like the physical higgs ) , then by field redefinitions it is always possible to recast the theory into our version given in eq.([action1 ] ) which includes all patches in field space so as to insure geodesic completeness .    as another example of our general formalism , we lift the bezrukov - shaposhnikov higgs inflation model @xcite to a fully scale invariant model , making it logically and physically consistent .",
    "based on our formalism for constructing general weyl - invariant actions , we show that the model is not unique .",
    "in fact , there are many single - field cosmological higgs models with the same properties , all consistent with conformal symmetry and producing the same inflationary outcome",
    ". however , this inflationary scenario is not geodesically complete , furthermore , in view of our complete set of solutions , it is extremely unlikely .    in sec .",
    "iv , we turn more generally to cosmology .",
    "we explain that a weyl - lifted theory can resolve the singularity and enable the geodesic completion of cosmological spacetimes , while also indicating the presence of new phenomena .",
    "our previous work in @xcite-@xcite elaborated in some detail on the properties of geodesically complete cosmological analytic solutions in the context of solvable examples of what was supposed to be toy models .",
    "however the same models now re - appear in our conformal standard model and hence our previous solutions are now the full set of cosmological solutions for all initial conditions of the familiar standard model . in particular , we point out a model independent attractor mechanism discovered in @xcite that may help to determine the likely initial conditions of our universe just after the big bang .",
    "the weyl - invariant formulation also provides a natural framework for incorporating cyclic cosmology @xcite driven only by the higgs field as introduced . in the case",
    "that the higgs field is metastable , the higgs inflation model is inoperable , but the minimal single - higgs model is naturally compatible with the cyclic picture @xcite . in general , the weyl - invariant approach also hints at the intriguing possibility that the minimal , electroweak higgs may have played a central role in cosmic evolution as explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "there is a deep connection between the ideas presented in this paper and theories in @xmath21-space and @xmath22-time dimensions .",
    "many of the ideas discussed here for a global or local conformally symmetric theory emerged progressively from developing the @xmath8 dimensional formalism since 1996 ( for a recent overview see @xcite ) , and then for the standard model as given in @xcite , for gravity in @xcite , for susy in @xcite and supergravity in @xcite .",
    "the formulation given in @xcite , with many scalars coupled to gravity and supergravity in @xmath8 and @xmath7 dimensions was the precursor of the general formalism presented in section iii , while the simplest specific models were analyzed cosmologically in some detail in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there are some recent similar examples @xcite that overlap with our conformal symmetry vision in @xmath7 dimensions ; these seem to be oblivious to our previous publications that introduced at an earlier stage the crucial conformal structures with restrictions on scalars in @xmath7 dimensions as predictions from 2t - physics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 theory has more predictions of hidden symmetries and dualities in @xmath7 dimensions which are mainly understood in classical and quantum mechanical contexts @xcite and are also partially developed in field theory @xcite ; these go well beyond conformal symmetry in their implications for unification and the meaning of spacetime and are bound to play an interesting role in future progress .",
    "we emphasize that , despite the name , the physics content in the 2t - physics formalism in @xmath23 dimensions is same as the physics content in the standard 1t - physics formalism in @xmath24 dimensions except that 2 t physics provides a holographic perspective and , due to a much larger set of gauge symmetries , naturally makes predictions that are not anticipated in 1t - physics .",
    "these additional gauge symmetries are in phase space rather than position space , and can be realized only if the formalism is developed with two times .",
    "nevertheless , the gauge invariant sector of 2t - physics is equivalent to a causal 1-time spacetime without any ghosts .    in this paper",
    ", we will stick to @xmath7 dimensions , advocating a coherent overall picture of a conformally invariant formulation of fundamental physics and cosmology .",
    "however , we will occasionally remind the reader that these outcomes naturally follow from @xmath8 dimensions with appropriate ( but unusual ) gauge symmetries .",
    "in this section , we will describe the motivation for and construction of simple theories with global and local scale invariance .",
    "an important application is the lift of the standard model plus gravity into a weyl- invariant theory that is also geodesically complete .",
    "we begin by examining a scale invariant extension of the standard model of particles and forces .",
    "for example consider the usual standard model with all the usual fields , including the doublet higgs field @xmath9 coupled to gauge bosons and fermions , but add also an su@xmath25u@xmath3 singlet @xmath0 ( plus right handed neutrinos and dark matter candidates ) , and take the following purely quartic renormalizable potential involving only the minimal set of scalar fields@xmath26 this model , discussed at some length in section vi of @xcite , is the minimal extension of the standard model that is fully scale invariant at the classical level , globally .",
    "see also @xcite-@xcite that use a similar field , and the different approach that also adds a weyl vector field @xcite leading to different physical consequences .",
    "the field @xmath0 , which we call the dilaton , absorbs the scale transformations and is analogous to the dilaton in string theory . in the current context",
    ", it has a number of interesting features : due to su@xmath1su@xmath25u@xmath3 gauge symmetry , the singlet @xmath13 is prevented from coupling to all other fields of the standard model - except for the additional right handed singlet neutrinos or dark matter candidates .",
    "these features of @xmath18 that prevent it from interacting substantially with standard visible matter except via the higgs in eq.([potential ] ) , suggest naturally that @xmath13 itself could be a candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "the only parameters associated with @xmath18 that are relevant for our discussion , are @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for positive @xmath29",
    "the minimum of this potential occurs at @xmath30 accordingly , the vacuum expectation value of the higgs may fluctuate throughout spacetime , depending on the dynamics of @xmath31 without breaking the scale symmetry .",
    "however , if for some reason ( e.g. driven by quantum fluctuations or gravitational interactions ) @xmath13 develops a vacuum expectation value @xmath32 which is constant in some region of spacetime , then the higgs is dominated by a constant vacuum expectation value @xmath33 with @xmath34 fixed by observation to be approximately @xmath35 the higgs vacuum @xmath36 provides the source of mass for all known elementary forms of matter , quarks , leptons , and gauge bosons ( while @xmath32 may be the source of majorana mass for neutrinos ) .",
    "the observation at the lhc of the higgs particle , which is just the small fluctuation on top of the vacuum value @xmath34 , has by now solidified the view that this is how nature works in our region of the universe , at least up to the energy scales of the lhc .",
    "fig .  1 illustrates how the higgs field slowly relaxes to the spontaneously broken symmetry vacuum described by eq .",
    "( [ v - value ] ) beginning from large oscillations shortly after the big bang . here ,",
    "as is the case throughout the paper , the solutions are in the limit of negligible gauge and top quark mass coupling so that the higgs evolution is described by classical equations of motion .",
    "this time - dependent behavior of the higgs is driven by the evolution of the field @xmath13 , as anticipated in @xcite for this simple model .",
    "in fact , it is realized as the generic solution for all homogeneous cosmological solutions if the higgs vacuum is stable .",
    "there are other interesting theoretical structures worth noting about this scale invariant setup . instead of supersymmetry",
    ", conformal symmetry may explain the stability of the hierarchy between the low mass scale of @xmath37 versus the planck scale of @xmath38 gev , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the conformal protection of the hierarchy is not as clear - cut as susy s protection and requires better understanding of regularization and renormalization techniques consistent with conformal symmetry as outlined in the introduction .",
    "what about the dilaton ( fluctuations in @xmath13 ) that emerges in the broken scale invariance scenario above ?",
    "at least from the perspective of only the standard model , the dilaton is a massless goldstone boson due to the spontaneous breaking of the global scale invariance .",
    "as discussed in some detail in section vi of @xcite , the original doublet field @xmath14 is the only field coupled to known matter , while @xmath13 is decoupled .",
    "however , after the spontaneous breaking , @xmath14 must be rewritten as a mixture of the mass eigenstates of the model , which include the observed massive higgs particle and the massless dilaton ( or maybe low - mass dilaton if the scale symmetry is broken by some source ) .",
    "the mixing strength is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 that appears in eq.([v - value ] ) .",
    "therefore , through this mixing , the ( pseudo- ) goldstone dilaton must couple to all matter , just like the higgs does , namely with a coupling given by the mixing angle @xmath40 times the mass of the particle divided by @xmath34 .",
    "the largest coupling is to the top quark .",
    "if @xmath32 is much larger than @xmath41 gev@xmath42 it is possible for the dilaton to hide from accelerator experiments due to the weak coupling of @xmath27 in eq.([alpha ] ) .",
    "such a ( pseudo ) goldstone boson has many other observable consequences , including a long range force that competes with gravity and contributions to quantum effects as a virtual particle in feynman loop diagrams . if such an additional massless ( or low mass scalar ) is observed in experiments , it would be strong evidence in favor of the scale invariant scenario .",
    "however , if it is not observed , this could be interpreted merely as setting a lower limit on the scale @xmath43    eventually it must be understood what sets the scale @xmath32 .",
    "the model as presented above has no mechanism at the classical level to set the scale @xmath32 ; its equations of motion are self consistent at the minimum of the potential , @xmath44 only if @xmath45 @xcite ; then @xmath32 remains undetermined due to a flat direction in the remaining term in the potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the value for @xmath32 would then be obtained phenomenologically from experiment , without a theoretical explanation .",
    "quantum corrections , such as those discussed in @xcite , may alleviate this problem by removing the flat direction .",
    "however , if the quantum corrections are small , there is the danger that @xmath32 would be so low that it is not possible to obtain the small value of @xmath27 in eq.([alpha ] ) required to protect the dilaton from current experimental limits .",
    "since at present there is no sign of the dilaton in low energy physics , suppose it does not exist at all as a degree of freedom .",
    "is this incompatible with the idea that conformal symmetry underlies fundamental physics ?",
    "not at all , because any possible phenomenological problems associated with a goldstone boson fluctuation of @xmath13 can be overcome if the scaling symmetry is a _ local _ gauge symmetry , known as the weyl symmetry . then the massless fluctuations of the dilaton can be eliminated by fixing a unitary gaugeu@xmath3 scalar field as part of the general theory that we will discuss in section ( [ generalgrav ] ) . but for simplicity in this section we will first concentrate on the minimal model that contains only the confirmed observed degrees of freedom up to now , thus allowing the fluctuations of a single @xmath13 to be eliminated by a gauge symmetry in this minimal model . ] .",
    "the standard model decoupled from gravity has no local scale symmetry that could remove a goldstone dilaton .",
    "but such a gauge symmetry can in fact be successfully incorporated as part of the standard model provided it is coupled to gravity in the right way .",
    "coupling the standard model to einstein gravity in the conventional way makes no sense because the dimensionful newton constant explicitly breaks scale invariance .",
    "if scale invariance is already broken in one sector of the theory , then there is no rationale for requiring that it be a good symmetry in another part of the theory . at best",
    ", it would occur as an accidental symmetry of low energy physics and only when gravity is negligible .",
    "this is not the scenario we have in mind ; we argue for a fully scale invariant approach to all physics , a natural outcome of the larger gauge symmetries in @xmath8 dimensions , as formulated in 2t - physics .",
    "happily , the idea of an underlying @xmath8 dimensions with appropriate extra gauge symmetry fits all known physics in @xmath7 dimensions , from dynamics of particles and field theory @xcite-@xcite all the way to supergravity @xcite .",
    "so , consistency with this larger underlying structure is well motivated .",
    "in fact , there is a locally scale invariant field theory in @xmath7 dimensions , compatible with 2t - physics in @xmath8 dimensions , that couples the standard model and gravity with no dimensionful constants .",
    "we do not mean conformal gravity which has ghost problems , but rather the non - minimal conformal coupling of the curvature @xmath46 to scalar fields @xcite which is invariant under weyl transformations as a gauge symmetry .",
    "in the next section we will discuss a generalized weyl invariant coupling with many scalar fields also predicted by 2t - physics , but in this section we begin with the well known method of conformally coupled scalars , as follows @xcite@xcite,@xmath47 these two terms form an invariant unit ( up to a total derivative ) under _ local _ scale transformations , @xmath48 , with a local parameter @xmath49 when there are more scalar fields , the most general way of achieving local conformal symmetry is discussed in section ( [ genweyl ] ) .",
    "however , when there is only one additional scalar field beyond @xmath18 which is in a single representation of a yang - mills gauge group , there is a unique way to also achieve geodesic completeness as explained in more detail in sections ( [ generalgrav],[confcosm ] ) .",
    "hence , _ for geodesic completeness _ we require that not only the field @xmath18 but also the doublet higgs field be a set of conformally coupled scalars consistent with su@xmath2u@xmath3 . namely using the unit @xmath50 which is also locally invariant ( up to a total derivative ) , we can lift the globally scale invariant standard model of the last section into a locally invariant one , while also being coupled to gravity in a gedesically complete theory .",
    "all other terms present in the usual standard model , namely all fermion , gauge boson and yukawa terms , when minimally coupled to gravity are already automatically invariant under the local weyl symmetry .",
    "hence a _ weyl invariant _",
    "action @xmath51 that describes the coupling of gravity and the standard model is given by @xmath52{c}\\frac{1}{12}\\left (   \\phi^{2}-2h^{\\dagger}h\\right )   r\\left (   g\\right )   \\\\",

    "the only yukawa couplings of @xmath13 allowed by su@xmath5su@xmath6u@xmath3 are to the right handed neutrinos for which it becomes a source of mass . note the relative minus sign between @xmath13 and @xmath14 terms , which is required , as explained below . here",
    "@xmath53 is the well known standard model lagrangian minimally coupled to gravity , except for the higgs kinetic and potential terms , which are now modified and explicitly written out in the first three lines .",

    "we note that the lagrangian ( [ action1 ] ) is the one obtained in the second reference in @xcite from the @xmath8 version of the standard model @xcite@xcite coupled to 2t- gravity @xcite , by a method of gauge fixing and solving some kinematical equations associated with constraints related to the underlying gauge symmetries . in that approach",
    "we learned that the weyl symmetry is not an option in @xmath7 dimensions , it is a prediction of 2t - physics : the @xmath8 dimensional theory is not weyl invariant , but yet the local weyl symmetry in @xmath7 dimensions emerges as a remnant gauge symmetry associated with the general coordinate transformations as they act in the extra @xmath60 dimensions .",
    "so the weyl symmetry is a required symmetry in @xmath7 dimensions as predicted in the @xmath8 dimensional approach ; this symmetry carries information and imposes properties related to the extra @xmath60 space and time dimensions @xcite .",
    "the weyl gauge symmetry of the action in ( [ action1 ] ) does not allow any dimensionful constants : no mass term in the higgs potential , no einstein - hilbert term with its dimensionful newton constant , or any other mass terms .",
    "this is a very appealing starting point because it leads to the emergence of all dimensionful parameters from a single source .",
    "that source is the field @xmath0 that motivated this discussion in the previous section , and the only scale is then generated by gauge fixing @xmath13 to a constant for all spacetime @xmath61 in the gauge fixed version of the lagrangian where @xmath62 we can express the physically important dimensionful parameters , namely , the newton constant @xmath63 , the cosmological constant @xmath64 associated with dark energy , and the electro - weak scale @xmath34 , in terms of @xmath32 : @xmath65    since the field @xmath0 in this gauge ceases to be a degree of freedom altogether , the massless dilaton is absent and the potential problem with global scaling symmetry is avoided . nevertheless , there still is an underlying hidden conformal symmetry for the full theory .",
    "we can explain now why it is necessary to have the opposite signs for @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the first two lines of the action in eq.([action1 ] ) .",
    "the positive sign for @xmath13 is necessary in order to obtain a positive gravitational constant in ( [ dimensionfulconstants ] ) .",
    "however , conformal symmetry then forces the kinetic term for @xmath13 to have the wrong sign , so @xmath13 is a ghost .",
    "this can be seen to be a gauge artifact , though , since in a unitary gauge the ghost @xmath13 is fixed to a constant or expressed in terms of other degrees of freedom .",
    "this also explains why @xmath14 must have the opposite sign , since otherwise @xmath14 would be a real ghost .",
    "this relative sign has important consequences in cosmology as follows .    in flat space @xmath66 where experiments such as those at the lhc are conducted ,",
    "the lagrangian above becomes precisely the usual standard model , including the familiar tachyonic mass term for the higgs .",
    "furthermore , in weak gravitational fields , at low energies , the gravitational effect of the higgs field coupling to the curvature , @xmath67 is ignorable since @xmath14 ( order of @xmath68 gev ) is tiny compared to the planck scale ( @xmath6910@xmath70 gev ) .",
    "actually , the gravitational constant measured at low energies is corrected by the electroweak scale , namely @xmath71 @xmath72 instead of ( [ dimensionfulconstants ] ) , but in practice this is a negligible correction since @xmath73 so , at low energies there is no discernible difference between our weyl - lifted theory and the usual standard model .",
    "the practically isolated standard model appears as a renormalizable theory decoupled from gravity .",
    "however , in the cosmological context , the conformally coupled @xmath14 can and will be large at some stages in the evolution of the universe . working out the dynamics of cosmological evolution",
    ", it turns out that , for generic initial conditions , @xmath74 typically grows to large scales over cosmological times , hitting @xmath75 in the vicinity of a big bang or big crunch singularity .",
    "this behavior plays an essential role in cosmological evolution , as well as in the resolution of the singularity via geodesic completeness . in our conformal theory ,",
    "the standard model is not isolated from gravity , and we posit that the higgs field can play a bigger role in nature than originally anticipated .",
    "we may take the higgs doublet in the unitary gauge of the su@xmath25u@xmath3 gauge symmetry @xmath76{c}0\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}s\\left (   x\\right ) \\end{array } \\right )   .",

    "the action for @xmath80 has the exact same form in those papers as here .",
    "thus , our previous analytical cosmological solutions can now be applied to investigate the cosmological properties of the higgs field . when the parameter @xmath27 vanishes , our previous work provides the full set of geodesically complete analytic cosmological solutions for all initial conditions of the relevant fields in the standard model coupled to gravity .",
    "the non - zero @xmath27 is then easily taken into account with numerical methods .",
    "this much analytic control over cosmological properties of a realistic theory is unprecedented .",
    "this became a very valuable tool that led us into a new cosmological scenario driven only by the higgs field , as outlined in section ( [ confcosm ] ) and completed in @xcite .",

    "for example , the relations between the @xmath282- and @xmath15-gauge fields can be easily derived by considering the weyl gauge invariants such as @xmath287 and @xmath288 @xmath289 etc .",
    ", for example we deduce @xmath290 from these , we can express @xmath291 and @xmath292 in terms of the single field @xmath293 so that the gauge condition ( [ egaugeu ] ) is satisfied . inserting these expressions into the gauge invariant action ( [ action2 ] ) we arrive at the same @xmath282-frame action as eq.([e - frame ] ) .",
    "as argued in our work @xcite-@xcite , classically geodesically complete solutions can be obtained for all single - scalar theories that can be cast in the form of eq.([action2 ] ) .",
    "but , for all patches of field space @xmath294 to be included , as demanded by the geodesics derived from @xmath179 in the einstein frame , @xmath295 must be brought to an appropriate form by using the field redefinitions discussed below eq.([xi ] ) .",
    "the patches of field space @xmath294 that are missing in the einstein frame can then be added in order to obtain a geodesically complete space .",
    "we have argued in @xcite , and provided a proof in section ( [ generalgrav ] ) , that geodesic completeness is accomplished when we bring @xmath119 to the form @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the sum of all scalars other than @xmath121    geodesics remain incomplete when they hit the singularity in all frames in which @xmath119 is always positive , or the equivalent einstein frame , such as the one in eq.([shoposh ] ) . when we rewrite those , by field redefinitions , in terms of new fields in which @xmath296 then the patches of field space @xmath298 are equivalent to the einstein frame , or to the other frames with positive @xmath119 .",
    "geodesic completion is achieved by allowing all regions of field space in the parametrization that has @xmath299 for this form , @xmath119 is allowed to smoothly go negative . in these",
    "coordinates the gauge invariant vanishing point of @xmath300 given by the gauge invariant expression @xmath301 has a special significance ; it corresponds to the singularity of the scale factor of the universe in the einstein gauge .",
    "this is seen by equating the gauge invariant @xmath302 in the einstein gauge , in which @xmath303 and the unimodular gauge ( labelled with @xmath276 ) , in which @xmath304 as follows @xmath305 at spacetime points or regions where @xmath306 which is where the gauge invariant quantity @xmath307 hits unity in all gauges , @xmath308 @xmath309 the geometry in the einstein gauge fails completely since @xmath310 , and this is how the cosmological singularity occurs at some point in time @xcite .",
    "then , as we can see in the @xmath15-gauge , the region @xmath311 ( higgs of planck size ) is the region of the big crunch or big bang singularity , where @xmath312 in any gauge .",
    "the behavior of the universe in this region is governed by a universal attractor mechanism that is independent of the scalar potential , therefore independent of the details of the model @xcite .",
    "although in the classical theory , cosmological singularities of frw - type are typically resolved in the weyl - lifted theory with @xmath313 in suitable weyl gauges , one should still worry about quantum gravity corrections .",
    "when @xmath119 vanishes , the coefficient of the ricci scalar in the gravitational action vanishes so there is no suppression of metric fluctuations and quantum gravity corrections should become large .",
    "however , it is notable that for certain types of cosmic singularities , including realistic ones , the metric and fields possess a unique continuation around the singularity in the complex time plane . a complex time path can be chosen to remain far from the singularity so that @xmath119 is always large and gravity remains weak .",
    "thus , we are able to find an analytic continuation of our classical solutions connecting big crunches to big bangs along which quantum gravity corrections are small .",
    "this issue is under active investigation and we defer further discussion to future work .    a particularly interesting application of weyl - invariance is to higgs cosmology , which the geodesically complete solutions show can be much more interesting than conventionally assumed .",
    "in fact , there is the possibility that the higgs field alone may be sufficient to explain the large - scale features of the universe , as suggested by the bezrukov - shaposhnikov higgs inflation model @xcite and our recent work on the higgs in cyclic cosmology @xcite@xcite .    in considering higgs cosmology or other models of the early universe ,",
    "we believe that the cosmological solutions found for geodesically complete theories provide some important new insights on the question of the likely initial conditions just after the big bang . for example , the _ generic _ behavior of the higgs after the bang when @xmath314 is dramatically different than the contrived initial conditions that are commonly assumed in higgs inflation scenarios .",
    "this is easily seen by examining the analytic work in @xcite@xcite , where for the simple model in eq.([action1 ] ) with @xmath315 all homogeneous solutions including curvature and radiation are obtained and the effects of anisotropy are determined @xcite . emphasizing that this is not only the contrived solutions , but all solutions , it serves as an example of the richness of the phenomena that occur in a model even with a simple potential .",
    "the results make clear a point that is obvious , but often forgotten : for a given scalar potential , there is an enormous range of cosmological solutions . by comparison ,",
    "it is clear that the slow - roll initial conditions frequently assumed in the analysis of cosmic inflation are very special and unlikely .",
    "for example , by transforming the inflationary solution in the bezrukov - shaposhnikov higgs inflation model @xcite to a field basis in which @xmath313 , it may be possible to trace cosmic evolution right back to the singularity and to judge whether the inflation is likely in the space of geodesically complete cosmological solutions .",
    "fig.(1 ) is an illustration of our solution for the _ generic _ cosmological behavior of the higgs field just after the big bang if the higgs potential has a stable non - trivial minimum , as in eq.([action1 ] ) , as usually assumed and as required for the bezrukov - shaposhnikov higgs inflation model @xcite .",
    "this figure describes the generic cosmological evolution of the higgs field , that must start with fluctuations of planck size and energy ( due to the universal attractor near the singularity @xcite ) , and quickly reduce its amplitude by losing energy to the gravitational field ; then after a phase transition , settle down to an almost constant value at the electroweak scale @xmath34 determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 in eq.([alpha ] ) .    cosmohiggs-stable.eps + fig.(1 ) - after the big bang the higgs field oscillates initially around zero with a large amplitude of the order of the planck scale .",
    "it slowly loses energy to the gravitational field , causing its amplitude to diminish . as it approaches the time or energies of the electroweak scale , it undergoes the phase transition seen in the figure , and then slowly settles to a constant vacuum value @xmath34 at a stable minimum of the potential .",
    "[ cosmohiggs-stable.eps ]    the solution of fig.(1 ) changes drastically if the vacuum is metastable after including quantum corrections , which is a possibility suggested by the most recent lhc data for the higgs and the top quark masses @xcite , and assuming no new physics up to the planck scale .",
    "metastability is incompatible with higgs inflation and generally causes problems for inflation because the higgs will typically escape from the metastable phase right after the big bang and roll to a state of negative energy density that can prevent inflation of any sort from occurring .",
    "the exact solutions of the weyl - invariant theory suggest an alternative cosmology in this case .",
    "the generic solution at first behaves as in fig.(1 ) after the big bang , all the way through the electroweak phase transition .",
    "but after some time ( order of the lifetime of the universe ) the higgs oscillations in the electroweak vacuum grow larger and larger , like the mirror image of fig.(1 ) , taking away energy from the gravitational field and eventually causing a collapse of the universe to a big crunch , while the higgs does a quantum tunneling to a lower state of the potential . at that stage our exact analysis near the singularity given in @xcite takes over to describe interesting new phenomena that occur just after the crunch and before another rebirth of the universe with a big bang .",
    "the result is a regularly repeating sequence in which the higgs field is trapped in its metastable state after a big bang , remains there for a long period of expansion followed by contraction , escapes as the universe approaches the big crunch , passes through to a big bang and becomes trapped again .",
    "the evolution can be considered a higgs - driven cyclic theory of the universe .",
    "the details are presented in a separate paper @xcite .",
