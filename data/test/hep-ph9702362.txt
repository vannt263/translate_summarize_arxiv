    "in field theory , currents which are conserved classically may not be quantum mechanically  @xcite .",
    "for example , in massless @xmath2 the conservation of the axial current is violated by the axial anomaly .",
    "the adler - bardeen theorem states that with the proper regularization scheme , the coefficient of the anomaly , as computed at one loop order , is exact to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , the axial anomaly does not change if the fermions propagate in either a thermal bath or a fermi sea  @xcite .    in vacuum ,",
    "one of the most striking manifestations of the axial anomaly is the decay of a neutral pion into two photons , as the amplitude is directly proportional to the coefficient of the axial anomaly in qed  @xcite .",
    "a natural supposition is then that because the axial anomaly does not change with temperature , neither does the amplitude for @xmath3  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the story is more involved .",
    "we compute with a gauged nonlinear sigma model  @xcite which properly incorporates all anomalies by inclusion of the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pion decay constant , @xmath6 is the number of colors , _ etc . _    in sec .",

    "we then extend the calculations to soft , cool pions at low temperature  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we work exclusively with two flavors in the chiral limit .",
    "the restriction to two flavors is done for ease of calculation , and is otherwise inessential . the chiral limit , @xmath8 , is assumed because then the pion decay amplitude is directly related to the axial anomaly ; for calculations at @xmath9 at nonzero temperature , see  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our results are relevant for @xmath9 ( as in vacuum ) , but more detailed analysis is required to establish this .    at nonzero temperature , calculations in a background field formalism  @xcite show that to @xmath10 , the zero temperature pion decay constant is replaced by a temperature dependent form  @xcite , @xmath11 thus a second guess for the change of @xmath12 with temperature would be that the zero temperature @xmath7 is replaced by @xmath13 . since @xmath13 decreases to @xmath10 , if true the amplitude , @xmath14 , would increase to this order .    in sec",
    "[ sec : lowt ] we evaluate precisely the same diagrams as at zero temperature to @xmath10 .",

    "this type of term was derived recently in nonlinear sigma models in the absence of gauge fields  @xcite : it is nonlocal , analogous to the hard thermal loops of hot gauge theories  @xcite . for @xmath3 , to order @xmath10 we find that the sum of these two terms is such that instead of increasing , like @xmath14 , the amplitude decreases , like @xmath15 , ( [ eq:3.8a ] ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ward ] we give a general analysis of the relationship between the chiral ward identities and the amplitude for @xmath3 .",

    ", this relationship is precise because of the sutherland - veltman theorem @xcite ( in a slight abuse of terminology ) .",
    "the proof of the sutherland - veltman theorem depends crucially upon lorentz invariance . a heat bath , however , provides a preferred rest frame ; extending an analysis of itoyama and mueller  @xcite ,",
    "we show that consequently , the sutherland - veltman theorem does not apply at any nonzero temperature .",
    "this is why @xmath3 changes with temperature , even though the anomaly does nt : besides the contributions from @xmath3 , because there is no sutherland - veltman theorem at nonzero temperature , there are other terms which enter to ensure that the adler - bardeen theorem is satisfied .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : adlerbardeen ] we demonstrate these general arguments by computing the correlator between one axial and two vector currents in the nonlinear sigma model to one loop order , @xmath10 . at nonzero temperature , new tensor structures arise in this correlator ; these structures are why the sutherland - veltman theorem is inapplicable at @xmath16 . nevertheless , when all terms are added together , we find that the adler - bardeen theorem remains valid to one loop order .",

    "@xmath24 is the renormalized pion field , and so @xmath25 for the pion decay constant , instead of fig .",
    "( 1.b ) we expand the axial current @xmath26 of ( [ eq : a.11 ] ) to cubic order in the pion field , @xmath27 contracting all pairs of pion fields , @xmath28 so that @xmath29 as is typical of nonlinear sigma models , unphysical , off - shell quantities such as @xmath19 , ( [ eq:2.5a ] ) , depend upon the parametrization of the coset space , while physical expressions , such as that for @xmath7 in ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) , do not .    turning to the amplitude for @xmath3 , from  ( [ eq:1.1 ] )",

    "the bare coupling @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 the right hand side of ( [ eq:2.10 ] ) is precisely the coefficient of the axial anomaly in qed  @xcite .    to evaluate fig .",

    "henceforth we drop the @xmath64 part of any integrals , assuming that they turn bare into renormalized quantities , such as @xmath21 into @xmath7 , throughout .",
    "the calculation of temperature dependent corrections to the pion decay constant proceeds as in the previous section . ignoring ultraviolet renormalization , in ( [ eq:2.8 ] )",
    "we replace @xmath63 by @xmath65 , and @xmath21 by @xmath7 , to obtain @xmath66 which was quoted in the introduction , ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) .",

    "in the previous section we found that the amplitude for @xmath1 diminishes to leading order in an expansion about low temperature , ( [ eq:3.8a ] ) . the question we address in this section is why is this amplitude tied to the coefficient of the axial anomaly at zero temperature , ( [ eq:2.17 ] ) , but not at nonzero temperature ?",
    "we work in the chiral limit to leading order about zero temperature , @xmath10 , because then we can make certain technical assumptions which simplify the discussion .",

    "@xmath3 vanishes once chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "this does not conflict with the anomalous ward identity since even if @xmath167 , there are other terms which can ensure that ( [ eq:4.18a ] ) is satisfied . for photons which do not thermalize ,",
    "so @xmath80 , even assuming that at the chiral critical point that the pion mass shell is @xmath166 , the tensors @xmath168 and/or @xmath169 will in general be nonzero .",
    "our analysis agrees with the results of contreras and loewe  @xcite , who computed the triangle diagram at @xmath55 with massive fermions .",
    "their result , ( 1.2 ) , is directly related to @xmath137 .",
    "there are two terms : the first is regular , temperature dependent , and gives the amplitude for @xmath119 , while the second is the anomaly , and is independent of temperature .    at first sight",
    "it might appear peculiar that the sutherland - veltman theorem applies at zero temperature , but fails at any nonzero temperature . even at zero temperature",

    "the left hand side of ( 4.13 ) does not vanish , and @xmath47 is not given by ( 4.14 ) .",
    "an example of this occurs when one ( or both ) of the photons are off the mass shell @xcite , even if @xmath148 .",
    "in particular , in the limit of large @xmath170 , it is known that @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "thus on the right hand side of ( 4.13 ) , we can neglect @xmath172 relative to the anomaly term , @xmath173 , and ( 4.13 ) tells us that a combination of @xmath174 and @xmath161 are given entirely by the anomaly , @xmath175 .",

    "whether the changes in these couplings are physically relevant can only be determined after detailed calculation ; what is certain is that they do change . in a cosmological context ,",
    "the mechanisms of electroweak baryogenesis involve the effective coupling of a pseudoscalar field to the pontryagin density for the @xmath218 gauge field . in vacuum , this coupling is directly related to the anomalous divergence of the baryon current .",

    "iv , these conditions are clearly much less restrictive at nonzero temperature .    if nothing else , perhaps this gives us a greater appreciation of the wonder of the fermion axial anomaly . while every other anomalous decays changes in complicated and detailed ways , that alone remains inviolate , always .",

    "this also enables us to discuss a novel form of the wzw model , mentioned recently  @xcite , and to comment about the two currents in the two - flavor version of the wzw model .    for @xmath219 flavors ,",
    "the model is constructed from a @xmath220 unitary matrix @xmath221 , @xmath222 . in the absence of gauge fields ,",
    "the action is the sum of two terms , @xmath223 , with @xmath224 the usual action for a nonlinear sigma model , @xmath225 the generators of @xmath226 are the matrices @xmath227 , normalized as @xmath228 .",

    "we wish to couple @xmath221 to a photon field @xmath234 in a gauge invariant manner . for three flavors",
    "the charge matrix is @xmath235 , and so we introduce the covariant derivative , @xmath236 $ ] . by construction , both @xmath221 and @xmath237 transform covariantly under local @xmath238 gauge transformations , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 . as usual , to make @xmath243 gauge invariant we simply replace the ordinary by the covariant derivative , @xmath244 .",
    "we can also do this for @xmath245 by replacing @xmath246 with the gauge covariant @xmath247 .",
    "using @xmath248 in @xmath245 gives something which is manifestly gauge invariant , but incomplete , since it can be shown that the ensuing equations of motion depend on the fifth dimension . in five dimensions , however , there are several other gauge invariant terms which can be added , involving powers of the ( abelian , gauge invariant ) field strength , @xmath249 .",
    "the correct action then follows uniquely by requiring that the equations of motion are independent of the fifth dimension@xcite , @xmath250 this expression is manifestly gauge invariant but not obviously independent of the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual action , in which the terms which couple to the gauge field are manifestly four dimensional , but not evidently gauge invariant : @xmath251 , where @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath254 the lagrangian  [ eq : a.5 ] is the form given by witten  @xcite : it is gauge invariant up to boundary terms .    henceforth we follow brihaye , pak , and rossi  @xcite and restrict ourselves to two flavors . introducing the pion field @xmath255 , @xmath256 then for @xmath257 @xmath258 @xmath259 .",

    "this demonstrates that @xmath267 is directly proportional to the baryon current  @xcite .",

    "we do not know if @xmath267 and @xmath268 are equal to the analogous currents for three or more flavors .    to conclude , we discuss how to compute the axial current @xmath270 of sec .",
    "[ sec : adlerbardeen ] using the noether construction .",
    "the general form for the gauged axial current is rather involved .",
    "since we compute perturbatively , however , we just compute the current in the same way . under an infinitesimal axial rotation , @xmath271 , the pion field transforms nonlinearly , @xmath272 to @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "after performing such a transformation , the requisite current is then the coefficient of @xmath275 .    in the present case , however , while the lagrangian is ( of course ) gauge invariant , the lagrangian density need not be . in particular , the lagragian density of ( [ eq : a.5 ] ) is not gauge invariant ; under a local gauge transformation , it transforms by a total derivative . to the order at which we compute , we add the following term to the lagrangian density : @xmath276 @xmath277 for example , the first piece contributes a chern - simons term to the current . with the addition of ( [ eq : a.20 ] ) ,",
    "the lagrangian density is manifestly gauge invariant , and the axial current is @xmath278 when @xmath279 , @xmath182 reduces to the axial vector current in the absence of electromagnetism , @xmath280 , as can be verified by expanding ( [ eq : a.11 ] ) .",
    "the terms linear and quadratic in @xmath180 agree with the calculation from the wess - zumino consistency condition , ( [ eq:5.1 ] ) .",
    "this ambiguity in the construction of the axial current is familiar . instead of the gauge invariant , anomalous current used in sec .",
    "[ sec : ward ] , by subtracting off a chern - simons term , we can choose to work instead with a current which is conserved but not gauge invariant .",
