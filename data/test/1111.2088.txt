    "this ` tail ' is about three orders of magnitude weaker than the intensity of the peak count rate of the measured photon .",
    "the response to the fe line is therefore described as a gaussian plus a constant at lower energies , approximately three orders of magnitude below the peak value and extending to below 1kev .",
    "due to the strong fe  k@xmath22 line and the very strong absorption in this source , the constant level response of the fe line extends above the measured flux below 2kev .",

    "the introduction of additional power law and/or black body components could improve the fits at lower energies .",

    "the total magnetic moment @xmath374 of the neutron star can be calculated with : @xmath412 using the average magnetic field from the phase averaged crsf centroid energy ( @xmath413 g ) and a typical neutron star radius of @xmath414 km . the value of the last part , including the azimuthal angle @xmath390 of the magnetic pole was estimated to the average value of 1.54 .",
    "the total average magnetic moment is divided into three components based on the cartesian coordinate system in figure  [ fig : nsmodel ] : @xmath415 where @xmath22 is the angle between the dipole field and the spin axis and @xmath231 is the rotation angle from the ephemeris , i.e. the x - axis .",
    "next , the vector @xmath416 was calculated for each individual phase bin @xmath417 used in the phase resolved analysis .",
    "@xmath418 the individual components of @xmath416 are the projections of each phase bin on the three axes , as seen from the line of sight of the observer .",
    "the angle @xmath375 corresponds to the angle between the line of sight and the spin axis .",
    "for each of the individual phase bins , the magnetic field was calculated using the position vector @xmath416 indicating the position of the magnetic pole and the vector @xmath419 , which indicates the magnetic moment : @xmath420    the calculated magnetic field values were then fitted to the measured magnetic field , varying the three angles @xmath375 , @xmath22 , and @xmath231 until the best fit converged . to avoid wrong solutions due to local minima ,",
    "the starting parameter of all three angles were varied in steps of @xmath421 before the fit was started .",
    "the best fit solutions resulted in the values that are discussed in detail in section 5.5 ."
