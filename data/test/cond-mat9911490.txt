    "the role of inelastic scattering in electron transport through mesoscopic systems is a topic of current theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "recent experiments have revealed the importance of the electron - phonon interaction in transport measurements performed on certain mesoscopic systems . in particular inelastic scattering effects",
    "have been observed directly in stm measurements of the differential conductance of molecules adsorbed on metallic substrates.@xcite theoretically the effects of inelastic scattering on electron transport through mesoscopic semiconductor devices have been investigated by a variety of methods ranging from green s function techniques@xcite to the fermi golden rule.@xcite some theoretical models have also been proposed to elucidate the effects of molecular vibrations on electron tunneling through molecules contacted by an stm.@xcite recent work has provided a method for calculating the electronic current at finite temperatures for electrons tunneling through a one - dimensional conductor in the presence of phonons.@xcite these approaches have yielded valuable insights into the behavior of specific systems .    in the absence of inelastic scattering and electron correlations",
    ", landauer theory@xcite provides a general framework for calculations of the electronic current through mesoscopic conductors that are coupled to ideal single- or multi - channel quasi - one - dimensional leads .",
    "it relates the electronic current to the transmission probability for an electron incident from the source lead to scatter elastically through the conductor and into the drain .",
    "the transmission probability is found by solving the single - electron quantum scattering problem .",
    "when inelastic processes such as phonon emission and absorption are considered , electron scattering becomes a many - body phenomenon involving electrons and the various excited phonon states of the system .",
    "a non - perturbative approach has been proposed by bon@xmath0a and trugman for treating this scattering problem for a system consisting of a mesoscopic conductor ( which supports the phonon modes ) coupled to two single - channel ideal leads that act as the electron source and drain.@xcite their method approximates the many - body problem by a multi - channel single - electron scattering problem which can be solved exactly .",
    "here each channel corresponds to a different vibrational quantum state of the mesoscopic conductor .",
    "using their approach it is possible to determine the transmission and reflection probabilities for all inelastic and elastic scattering events that an electron may suffer in the conductor as it goes from the source to the drain .",
    "this method has been applied to study the effects of phonons on electron transmission through one - dimensional conductors where the electron - phonon coupling has been modelled using the holstein hamiltonian@xcite and the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the present article is complementary to the above theoretical work .",
    "its purpose is to generalize the landauer theory of electrical conduction to mesoscopic systems with electron - phonon scattering , assuming that the latter is described accurately within the multi - channel single - electron scattering approach of bon@xmath0a and trugman@xcite .",
    "i.e. , given the bon@xmath0a - trugman@xcite solution of the inelastic scattering problem , our objective is to calculate the electric current by appropriately generalizing landauer theory .",
    "when transport in a many - electron system is described in terms of one - electron scattering processes , the pauli exclusion principle needs to be considered since in general electrons involved in different transitions may compete to occupy the same final state . in treatments of transport based on the boltzmann equation ,",
    "if the electron scattering is elastic , this competition has no effect because of a mutual cancellation of terms.@xcite however such a cancellation does not occur when scattering is inelastic.@xcite in landauer theory scattering is assumed to be elastic and the electronic current is carried by electrons which occupy single - particle scattering states that extend across the mesoscopic conductor from the source to the drain .",
    "these scattering states are orthogonal to each other.@xcite because of this orthogonality , if an electron populates one of these scattering states it does not compete with any of the other filled scattering states .",
    "thus in landauer theory ( as in the elastic case of the boltzmann equation ) the pauli exclusion principle for the final states in the scattering processes does not play a role in the determination of the electronic current .    in our generalization of landauer theory that includes inelastic scattering ,",
    "this is no longer true : different scattering processes can send electrons to the same outgoing state and the pauli principle plays an important role in determining the occupations of the outgoing channels . in the boltzman treatment of inelastic scattering the pauli principle is applied to the non - equilibrium one - electron distribution function for the system since transport is an inherently non - equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "here we apply an analogous principle : in our extension of landauer theory the pauli exclusion principle is applied to the non - equilibrium electron distributions in the _ outgoing _ channels of the scattering process and these distributions must be determined self - consistently . since some processes may be excluded because of the pauli principle , overall particle conservation is another consideration that must be taken into account when trying to generalize landauer theory to include inelastic scattering .",
    "we have developed a practical method for determining these non - equilibrium electron distributions for a class of mesoscopic systems .",
    "these systems are similar to those considered by bon@xmath0a and trugman@xcite in that they consists of a mesoscopic conductor which is attached to two single mode ideal leads which act as a source and drain , and phonons are assumed to be present only on the conductor and not on the ideal leads .",
    "we consider scattering processes which change the conductor s phonon state or leave it unchanged .",
    "each of these processes contributes to the non - equilibrium electron distribution .",
    "we determine each contribution self - consistently ( i.e. , in the presence of the other processes that can occur ) in terms of the transmission and reflection probabilities for the given process and the fermi functions that describe the incoming electron distributions in the left and right leads . included in this self - consistent method",
    "is the constraint of particle conservation .",
    "we do not however include cumulative effects of the current on the phonon distribution in the conductor ; i.e. , we assume that the conductor is in contact with a heat bath . with the non - equilibrium electron distribution",
    "determined we then evaluate the current flowing through this system for finite temperatures and bias voltages .",
    "as an application of the above theoretical approach we calculate the electronic current as a function of voltage for a two site molecule .",
    "the molecule has two single - particle molecular energy levels through which electrons from the leads can resonantly tunnel .",
    "it also has two longitudinal phonon modes which can be excited .",
    "a ssh hamiltonian is used to represent the electron - phonon coupling . for our model system one of the phonon modes",
    "is chosen to have an energy equal to the gap between the two electronic energy levels .",
    "because of this , electrons which are resonant with the higher energy level can emit a phonon and be resonant with the lower level .",
    "such a process is found to be highly transmitting . when the voltage is high enough that there is a sufficient number of electrons in the left lead that can undergo this process , we find that the current in the right lead due to elastically scattered electrons is reduced significantly due to competition with these inelastically scattered electrons .",
    "thus we find that the mutual exclusion between the scattered electrons that make up the non - equilibrium distribution in the drain lead can have important consequences for the electronic current flowing through the molecule .    in sec .",
    "ii we describe the class of systems that we study and explain how the scattering states are calculated . in sec .",
    "iii we present our generalization of the landauer theory and our method for calculating the non - equilibrium the electron distribution and associated electronic currents .",
    "we then apply our methodology to a simple model for a two site molecular chain and calculate its current - voltage characteristics in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in the absence of inelastic scattering and electron correlations , electron transport through a mesoscopic conductor can be described in terms of the probability @xmath1 that a single electron with energy @xmath2 scatters through the conductor from the source to the drain at an applied bias voltage @xmath3.@xcite when phonons ( or vibrational modes ) of the conductor are considered , an electron entering from the source can suffer inelastic collisions by absorbing or creating phonons before entering the drain .",
    "each of these processes can be described by its own transmission probability .",
    "if we assume that the source and drain are single mode leads which are free from phonons , we can characterize the above single electron scattering process by a transmission probability @xmath4 .",
    "this describes an electron that enters from the left lead @xmath5 with energy @xmath2 , suffers inelastic collisions on the conductor which change the phonon population on the conductor from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and then scatters into the right lead @xmath8 with energy @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , an electron incident from the left lead can suffer a collision and be reflected back into the left lead .",
    "this is characterized by a reflection probability @xmath10 .",
    "elastic scattering processes are included with @xmath7 being equal to @xmath6 .",
    "for all processes the total energy is conserved , so @xmath9 plus the net energy of all of the created and destroyed phonons is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "we now describe a method for calculating these transmission and reflection probabilities for a mesoscopic structure .    a schematic of our model for the mesoscopic conductor , which consists of a source ( left ) and a drain ( right ) lead attached to a one - dimensional conductor / wire",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "we assume that the leads are ideal and that they only have one electronic channel .",
    "phonons are considered to be only on the conductor and not on the ideal leads .",
    "an electron flows through the wire under an applied bias @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the voltage drop only occurs at the interface between the wire and the leads with the left lead held at @xmath11 and the right lead held at @xmath12 .",
    "we solve the transport problem by solving schrdinger s equation for the many - body wavefunction of the electron - phonon system from which we extract the transmission and reflection coefficients mentioned above .",
    "these will be used in the calculation of the non - equilibrium electron distributions and the current which follows in the next section .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 of this system can be split up into the hamiltonians for the isolated systems consisting of the left lead @xmath14 , the right lead @xmath15 , and the conductor @xmath16 .",
    "it also includes the coupling between the wire and the left and right leads , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "thus we write , @xmath19 we treat each of the above hamiltonians in the tight binding approximation .",
    "we model the wire using a set of orthogonal atomic orbitals @xmath20 .",
    "each atomic state has an energy @xmath21 with a corresponding creation operator @xmath22 which creates an electron in that state . in our hamiltonian for",
    "the wire an electron can hop from orbital @xmath23 to all nearest neighbor orbitals @xmath24 , and this is governed by the hopping parameter @xmath25 for the equilibrium configuration of atoms .",
    "the wire also has a discrete set of vibrational modes , each characterized by a frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the phonons on the wire are described by the state @xmath27 is created by the operator @xmath28 . to first order in phonon creation / destruction operators",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is given by @xmath29 , and this governs the process of an electron hopping from site @xmath23 to site @xmath24 and exciting or de - exciting a phonon in mode @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath31-site wire that we consider is , @xmath32 the leads are modelled as a chain of atoms each with a single atomic orbital @xmath33 , where @xmath34 labels the site . for the left lead @xmath34 ranges from @xmath35 to @xmath36 . on the right lead @xmath34",
    "ranges from @xmath37 to @xmath38 . on the left lead an electron",
    "is created on site @xmath34 by the operator @xmath39 .",
    "the site energy is given by @xmath40 .",
    "electrons can hop to nearest neighbor sites and this is controlled by the hopping parameter @xmath41 . similarly on the right lead an electron can exist on site @xmath34 in an orbital with energy @xmath42 .",
    "the nearest neighbor hopping is controlled by the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "since we assume that there are no phonons on the leads the hamiltonians for the left and right leads are given by @xmath44 the wire is coupled to the leads via @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that only the sites on the leads directly adjacent to the wire are coupled to the wire .",
    "electrons can hop from these lead sites to any site @xmath24 on the wire and this is governed by @xmath45 for the left lead and @xmath46 for the right lead .",
    "we take the electron - phonon interaction between the leads and the wire to first order .",
    "this allows for electrons from the leads to hop onto the wire and excite a phonon in mode @xmath30 .",
    "this electron - phonon interaction is given by @xmath47 for the left lead and @xmath48 for the right lead .",
    "thus the coupling potentials are , @xmath49    we now determine the scattering wavefunction from schroedinger s equation , latexmath:[$h |\\psi^{\\alpha}\\rangle = e    phonon state on the conducting wire .",
    "the wavefunction describes the many body system consisting of a single electron and the phonons .",
    "as shown by bon@xmath0a and trugman , the scattering process can be represented graphically.@xcite the power of this representation is in that the many - body problem can be viewed as a multi - channel single - electron scattering problem .",
    "the @xmath7 channel in either the left or the right leads corresponds to an electron propagating in the single electron mode of that lead with the wire being in its @xmath7 phonon state . a scattering process which changes the phonon state from @xmath51 to @xmath52",
    "can then be represented graphically as an electron incident from the @xmath6 channel and then scattering into the @xmath7 channel .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a graphical representation of the scattering channels for a simple single site wire described by the above hamiltonian .",
    "an electron incident in the @xmath6 channel in the left lead can scatter elastically or inelastically into any of the outgoing channels in the left and right lead .",
    "channels are connected horizontally by the electron hopping part of the hamiltonian whereas they are connected vertically by the electron - phonon interaction .    with this picture in mind",
    ", we now write explicit forms for the wavefunction on the left lead ( l ) , right lead ( r ) and the wire conductor ( c ) .",
    "we assume that the wire is initially in the phonon state @xmath53 and that there is a rightward propagating electron in a bloch mode latexmath:[$\\sum_n e^{i n y^{\\alpha } }    can then be reflected elastically or inelastically into any of the other channels in the left lead and propagate in a new bloch mode with energy @xmath9 in the left lead with the wire in a new phonon state @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the wavefunction on the left lead will consist of the initial state plus a sum over all possible reflected states with some unknown coefficients @xmath56 . on the wire",
    "the wavefunction will be a linear combination of the product of the atomic orbitals with all of the different phonon states .",
    "on the right lead the electron can be transmitted into any of the outgoing channels and propagate in a bloch state with an energy @xmath9 , leaving the wire in a phonon state @xmath55 .",
    "thus the wavefunction on the right lead will be a sum over all transmitted states with coefficients @xmath57 to be determined .",
    "thus we have @xmath58 with @xmath59 the total energy of the system is conserved , so @xmath60 , where @xmath9 is the energy of the scattered electron .",
    "@xmath61 corresponds to the reduced wavevector of an electron propagating with energy @xmath9 and is determined from the condition @xmath62 depending on whether it is in the left or right lead .",
    "inserting the above wavefunction into schrdinger s equation @xmath63 yields a system of linear equations which can be solved numerically for the @xmath57 , @xmath56 , and the @xmath64 at each energy @xmath2 . for our particular model based on single channel",
    "leads we then determine the transmission and reflection coefficients for each inelastic channel using , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the velocity of the electron in the @xmath7 channel of the left or right lead respectively .",
    "we then solve the corresponding problem for electrons incident from the right lead to determine @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we now proceed to show how these quantities are used to calculate the non - equilibrium electron distribution and current for the above system .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , when calculating the current using landauer theory the pauli exclusion principle for final states does not play a role ; scattered electrons do not compete with each other .",
    "a complication that arises when inelastic scattering processes are considered is that electrons can now compete with other electrons that are scattered to the same final state ; the pauli principle becomes important .",
    "for instance , for the system discussed in sec .",
    "ii , an electron which suffers an inelastic collision that puts it into a final state with energy @xmath9 in the drain competes with all other scattered electrons that can occupy that final state ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the likelihood that this state is unoccupied in the drain is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the non - equilibrium electron distribution function in the drain .",
    "using the equilibrium electron distribution ( fermi function ) here is not correct since we are discussing transport , an inherently non - equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "we will now explain how to determine this non - equilibrium distribution for the model presented in sec .",
    "[ fig3 ] depicts the processes we are considering for electrons that scatter from various initial states with differing energies @xmath2 to the same final state at energy @xmath9 in the right lead .",
    "some assumptions must be made about which processes can compete with each other . to be consistent with landauer theory we assume that elastic scattering processes do not compete with other elastic scattering processes ( these correspond to those processes which both begin and end at energy @xmath9 labelled a1 and b1 in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . with this assumption",
    "an electron which is elastically scattered from the source to the drain at energy @xmath9 does not compete with an electron which is elastically reflected back into the drain at the same energy ( process b1 ) . however , elastically scattered electrons can compete with all electrons that can be inelastically scattered to the same final state .",
    "the inelastically scattered electrons correspond to those electrons which start at various energies @xmath2 labelled a2 , a3 and b2 in fig .",
    "we also assume that inelastically scattered electrons compete with all other scattered electrons that start in a different initial electron state ( i.e. electrons undergoing process a2 compete with electrons suffering processes a1 , a3 , b1 and b2 ) .    at a given final scattered energy @xmath9",
    ", we consider the following contributions to the non - equilibrium rightward moving electron distribution in the right lead : elastically scattered electrons transmitted from the left lead @xmath72 , inelastically scattered electrons transmitted from the left lead @xmath73 ( the final phonon state is @xmath7 ) , elastically scattered electrons which originate in the right lead and are reflected back into the right lead @xmath74 , and inelastically scattered electrons which start in the right lead and are reflected back into the right lead @xmath75 .",
    "( the @xmath76 denotes transmitted electrons , the @xmath77 reflected electrons and the @xmath78 signifies that these are the distributions in the right lead ) .    to determine the contribution to the non - equilibrium distribution in the right lead _ that is due to transmitted electrons _",
    "we must first consider the distribution of electrons incident from the left lead .",
    "as in landauer theory , we assume that this distribution is given by the equilibrium electron distribution function which exists deep in the left lead . this is the fermi function for the left lead @xmath79 where the electro - chemical potential is @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the common fermi energy of the two leads and @xmath3 the applied bias voltage .",
    "an electron incident with energy @xmath2 from the left lead can then scatter elastically or inelastically into the final state with energy @xmath9 with a transmission probability @xmath4 .",
    "( elastic scattering corresponds to @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) . because we now have a number of processes which can place electrons into this same final state the pauli exclusion principle must be considered .",
    "to incorporate this into our determination of the distribution function we must then consider the probability that this state is unoccupied by competing electrons in the drain . for the distribution due to elastically scattered electrons , this probability will be determined by the non - equilibrium electron distributions of the inelastically transmitted and reflected electrons , according to the above assumptions .",
    "it is given by @xmath84 .",
    "for the distribution of a specific inelastic transmitting process , the probability that the state in the right lead is unoccupied by competing electrons is determined by the distributions due to all other scattering processes .",
    "it is given by @xmath85 .",
    "the transmitted electron distributions will be proportional to the product of the above probabilities with @xmath86 and with the respective transmission probability @xmath87 .",
    "we define the appropriate proportionality constant for electrons incident from the left lead with energy @xmath2 , to be @xmath88 .",
    "this proportionality constant will be determined by imposing the constraint of particle conservation . combining the above considerations we arrive at the following expressions for the contributions to the non - equilibrium electron distribution due to elastically and inelastically transmitted electrons : @xmath89 @xmath90 similarly for the contributions to the non - equilibrium electron distribution in the right lead due to elastically and inelastically _",
    "reflected _ electrons , we must consider the distribution of incident electrons given by the fermi function @xmath91 for the right lead where @xmath92 .",
    "those electrons which are incident with energy @xmath2 can be inelastically or elastically reflected into the final state with energy @xmath9 with a probability @xmath69 .",
    "again we take into account the competition for the occupation of this state using the pauli principle . for elastically reflected electrons the probability that this state is unoccupied is the same as that for elastically transmitted electrons . for inelastically reflected electrons the probability that the state is unoccupied is determined by all distributions due to different scattering processes .",
    "it is given by @xmath93 .",
    "again , the reflected electron distribution will be proportional to the product of the above probabilities with r and @xmath94 . for electrons incident from the right lead with energy @xmath2 ,",
    "the proportionality constant is @xmath95 .",
    "based on these considerations we write the non - equilibrium distributions in the right lead due to elastically and inelastically scattered electrons as @xmath96 @xmath97    similarly a system of equations is set up for the non - equilibrium electron distributions in the left lead , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "( here , @xmath76 signifies transmitted electrons from the right lead to left lead , @xmath77 refers to reflected electrons in the left lead , and @xmath5 denotes that all these distributions are in the left lead ) .",
    "the last consideration we must impose is particle conservation .",
    "particle conservation requires that the total incoming current be equal to the sum of the total transmitted current plus the total reflected current .",
    "this will allow us to determine the constants of proportionality for both the left and right leads .",
    "for the left lead we apply the following equality , @xmath102 this equality expresses that the incident electron distribution is equal to the sum over all transmitted and reflected electron distributions that arise from that incident channel .",
    "since all of the transmitted and reflected distributions originated from the same incident channel , they all involve the same proportionality constant @xmath88 .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows a schematic of our system .",
    "each atom making up the molecule has just one atomic orbital , so the isolated two atom molecule has two discrete electronic energy levels .",

    "when longitudinal phonons on the molecule are considered we expect interesting physics to occur when one of the phonon energies corresponds to the energy gap between the two energy levels of the molecule . when an electron is incident at an energy corresponding to the higher molecular level it can emit a phonon and drop to the lower electronic energy level .",

    "graph ( c ) is for the process where a single excitation is created in both phonon modes .",
    "the transmission probability of this process is essentially the superposition of fig .",
    "[ fig6]a and b , with an overall reduction in amplitude because this corresponds to a higher order process .",
    "we now proceed to calculate the non - equilibrium electron distributions from the calculated one - electron transmission and reflection coefficients using the method presented in sec .",
    "we take the fermi energy of the leads to be @xmath144 ev .",
    "the non - equilibrium distributions play an important role in the calculation of the current because of the pauli principle .",
    "for instance , the presence of inelastically transmitted or back - scattered electrons can result in a significant suppression of the elastically transmitted current . in this system ,",
    "as mentioned above , the process whereby an electron creates a phonon with energy @xmath145 and is then at resonance with the lower electronic resonant tunnelling state , is strongly transmitting in the inelastic spectrum at @xmath146ev . at low voltages there are not very many of these particular inelastic processes occurring since there are not many electrons with this energy incident from the left lead , and the final electron states for the transitions are almost fully occupied by competing elastic processes . at higher voltages ( greater than 0.55 v )",
    "there is a significant number of these processes and the non - equilibrium distribution @xmath147 where @xmath7 corresponds to the phonon state @xmath148 is significant .",
    "as the voltage increases further , the total distribution due to inelastically scattered electrons continues to grow as more processes become energetically favourable .",
    "the total non - equilibrium fermi distribution for all of the transmitted elastically scattered electrons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a for 0.5 v ( solid line ) and 1 v ( dashed line ) . fig .",
    "[ fig7]b shows the corresponding distribution for inelastically transmitted electrons .",
    "it highlights how this distribution function increases as more inelastic processes become energetically favourable .",
    "it also shows that there is a significant presence of inelastically scattered electrons in the drain for energies around -10.25 ev . at this energy ,",
    "elastically scattered electrons are also particularly strongly transmitting and the dip in the distribution of the inelastically scattered electrons at this energy is due to the presence of these elastically scattered electrons in the drain .",
    "this is labelled `` a '' in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b .",
    "these non - equilibrium distributions are now used to evaluate the current flowing through the two atom molecule . in fig .",
    "[ fig8]a , b we show the total rightward flowing current that is elastically and inelastically transmitted through the molecule , evaluated using our method .",
    "we also show ( dotted lines ) the corresponding currents evaluated assuming instead that the non - equilibrium distribution of electrons in the drain that appears in the pauli exclusion factor is replaced simply by the equilibrium fermi function in the right lead . for transmitted elastically scattered electrons this simplified expression for the current",
    "is @xmath149 for models that do _ not _ include electron - phonon interactions , the _ net _ current through the molecule obtained in this way is the same@xcite as is obtained from landauer theory , although the factor @xmath150 does not appear in the latter as was explained in the introduction . however if electron - phonon interactions are present , approximating the effects of the pauli principle in this way does not account for competition between elastic and inelastic processes which ( at higher voltages ) inject electrons into states that are unoccupied according to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "this approximation ( even at low voltages ) also violates particle conservation when electron - phonon interactions are present .    by using the non - equilibrium distributions described in section iii these effects",
    "are properly taken into account and current is conserved .",
    "all of this is reflected in the graphs : in fig .",
    "[ fig8]a initially the solid curve ( the present result ) shows significantly more elastic current ( as expected from landauer theory ) , and then eventually the elastic current is reduced due to the presence of transmitted inelastically scattered electrons in the normally unoccupied states of the drain .",
    "the total current flowing through the molecule as a function of voltage is shown in fig .",
    "the larger total current exhibited by the solid curve is a manifestation of current conservation in the present formalism .",
    "the dashed curve falls below the solid curve because the approximations used to calculate it do not conserve current .",
    "we have shown that to generalize landauer theory to include the effects of inelastic scattering , it is necessary to calculate self - consistently the non - equilibrium contributions to the electron distribution in the source and the drain leads . we have developed a method for determining these non - equilibrium distributions and applied it to a simple model .",
    "the model was based on single - channel ideal leads attached to a mesoscopic conductor .",
    "phonons were only considered on the conductor .",
    "the non - equilibrium distributions were determined solely in terms of the fermi functions of the left and right leads and the transmission and reflection probabilities for the various one - electron elastic and inelastic scattering processes considered .",
    "we showed how to properly take account of the pauli exclusion principle and particle conservation in the calculation of the non - equilibrium electron distribution .",
    "we applied our approach to a two site molecule .",
    "one of the phonons had an energy that corresponded to the molecular energy level gap .",
    "for this system we found that the details of the non - equilibrium electron distribution had an important role in the determination of the current . at higher voltages we found that the distribution in the right lead due to inelastically scattered electrons began to compete significantly with elastically scattered electrons because of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we found that this competition resulted in a reduction of the elastically scattered current at higher voltages .",
    "this work was supported by nserc .",
    "to find the vibrational modes of a molecule the atoms and bonds may be modelled by a set of balls and springs . for our model , we consider chain - like molecules , and represent the chain as a set of balls with effective springs connecting nearest neighbor atoms . the longitudinal displacement from equilibrium of the @xmath151 atom with mass @xmath152 in the molecule",
    "is given by the coordinate @xmath153 .",

    "the effects of longitudinal vibrations on the electronic properties of the molecule can be taken into account by using the su - schreiffer - hieger ( ssh ) model.@xcite in it , the nearest neighbor hopping parameter @xmath168 between two neighboring atomic sites is expanded to linear order in terms of their atomic displacements from equilibrium .",
    "this gives , @xmath169 where @xmath25 is the hopping parameter at @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "( note @xmath172 ) .    by using the above expression for @xmath153 in terms of the @xmath160 s , and writing them in their second quantized form ,",
