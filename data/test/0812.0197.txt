    "in this paper , we describe a new methodology for studying persistence of topological features across a family of spaces or point - cloud data sets .",
    "this theory of _ zigzag persistence _ generalises the successful and widely used theory of persistence and persistent homology  @xcite",
    ". moreover , zigzag persistence can handle several important situations that are not currently addressed by standard persistence .",
    "the zigzag persistence framework is activated whenever one constructs a _",
    "zigzag diagram _ of topological spaces or vector spaces : a sequence of spaces @xmath0 where each adjacent pair is connected by a map @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the novelty of our approach is that the direction of each linking map is arbitrary , in contrast to the usual theory of persistence where all maps point in the same direction .",
    "this paper has three principal objectives :    * to describe several scenarios in applied topology where it is natural to consider zigzag diagrams ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) . * to develop a mathematical theory of persistence for zigzag diagrams ( sections [ sec : zigzags ] and  [ sec : zigzag2filt ] ) .",
    "* to develop algorithms for computing zigzag persistence ( section  [ sec : algorithms ] ) .",
    "there is one subsidiary objective :    * to introduce the _ diamond principle _ , a calculational tool analogous in power and effect to the mayer ",
    "vietoris theorem in classical algebraic topology ( section  [ sec : further ] ) .",
    "this is a theoretical paper rather than an experimental paper , and we devote most of our effort to covering the mathematical foundations adequately .",
    "the technical basis for zigzag persistence comes from the theory of graph representations , also known as quiver theory .",
    "we are deeply indebted to the practitioners of that theory ; what is new here is the emphasis on algorithmics and on applications to topology ( particularly sections [ sec : intro ] , [ sec : algorithms ] and  [ sec : further ] ) .",
    "one of the principal challenges when attempting to apply algebraic topology to statistical data is the fact that traditional invariants  such as the betti numbers or the fundamental group  are extremely non - robust when it comes to discontinuous changes in the space under consideration .",
    "persistent homology  @xcite is the single most powerful existing tool for addressing this problem .",
    "a typical workflow runs as follows  @xcite .",
    "the input is a _ point cloud _ , that is , a finite subset of some euclidean space or more generally a finite metric space .",
    "after an initial filtering step ( to remove undesirable points or to focus on high - density regions of the data , say ) , a set of vertices is selected from the data , and a simplicial complex  @xmath3 is built on that vertex set , according to some prearranged rule . in practice , the simplicial complex depends on a coarseness parameter  @xmath4 , and what we have is a nested family @xmath5}$ ] , which typically ranges from a discrete set of vertices at  @xmath6 to a complete simplex at  @xmath7 .",
    "persistent homology takes the entire nested family @xmath8 and produces a _",
    "barcode _ or _ persistence diagram _ as output .",
    "a barcode is a collection of half - open subintervals @xmath9 , which describes the homology of the family as it varies over  @xmath4 .",
    "an interval @xmath10 represents a homological feature which is born at time  @xmath11 and dies at time  @xmath12 .",
    "this construction has several excellent properties :    * there is no need to select a particular value of  @xmath4 .",
    "* features can be evaluated by interval length .",
    "long intervals are expected to indicate essential features of the data , whereas short intervals are likely to be artefacts of noise .",
    "* there exists a fast algorithm to compute the barcode  @xcite . *",
    "the barcode is a complete invariant of the homology of the family of complexes  @xcite .",
    "* the barcode is provably stable with respect to changes in the input  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , any individual homology group @xmath13 is highly unstable .",
    "the major limitation of persistence is that it depends crucially on the family @xmath8 being nested , in the sense that @xmath14 whenever @xmath15 .",
    "this applies to the current theoretical understanding as well as the algorithms .",
    "zigzag persistence addresses this limitation .",
    "if we discretise the variable  @xmath4 to a finite set of values , the family of simplicial complexes can be thought of as a diagram of spaces @xmath16 where the arrows represent the inclusion maps .",
    "if we apply the @xmath17-dimensional homology functor @xmath18 with coefficients in a field  @xmath19 , this becomes a diagram of vector spaces @xmath20 and linear maps , where @xmath21 .",
    "such a diagram is called a _",
    "persistence module_. what makes persistence work is that there is a simple algebraic classification of persistence modules up to isomorphism ; each possible barcode corresponds to an isomorphism type .    our goal is to achieve a similar classification for diagrams in which the arrows may point in either direction",
    "this is zigzag persistence , in a nutshell .",
    "we consider some problems which arise quite naturally in the computational topology of data .",
    "[ densityprofile ] some of the most interesting properties of a point cloud are contained in the estimates of the probability density from which the data are sampled .",
    "deep structure is sometimes revealed after thresholding according to a density estimate ( see @xcite for an example drawn from visual image analysis ) .",
    "however , the construction of a density estimation function  @xmath22 invariably depends on choosing a smoothing parameter : for instance @xmath23 might be defined to be the number of data points within distance  @xmath24 of  @xmath25 ; here @xmath24 is the smoothing parameter .",
    "it happens that different choices of smoothing parameter may well reveal different structures in the data ; a particularly striking example of this occurs in  @xcite .",
    "statisticians have invented useful criteria for determining what the ` appropriate ' value of such a parameter might be for a particular data set ; but another point of view would be to analyse all values of the parameter simultaneously , and to study how the topology changes as the parameter varies .",
    "the problem with doing this is that there is no natural relationship between , say , the @xmath26 densest points as measured using two different parameter values .",
    "this means that one can not build an increasing family of spaces using the change in parameters , and so one can not use persistence to analyze the evolution of the topology . on the other hand , there are natural zigzag sequences which can be used to study this problem .",
    "select a sequence of parameter values @xmath27 and a percentage  @xmath28 , and let @xmath29 denote the densest @xmath30 of the point cloud when measured according to parameter value  @xmath24 .",
    "we can then consider the union sequence @xmath31 or the intersection sequence @xmath32 as we see in section  [ subsec : strongdiamond ] , there is essentially no difference between the zigzag persistent homology of the union and intersection sequences of a sequence of spaces . here",
    "that assertion needs to be filtered through the process of representing the data subsets  @xmath29 as simplicial complexes .",
    "[ sampling ] suppose we are given a very large point cloud  @xmath33 . if it is too large to process directly , we may take a sequence of small samples @xmath34 and estimate their topology individually , perhaps obtaining a persistence barcode for each one .",
    "how does this reflect the topology of the original sample  @xmath33 ?",
    "on one hand , if most of the barcodes have similar appearance , then one might suppose that @xmath33 itself will have the same barcode .",
    "on the other hand , one needs to be able to distinguish between a single feature detected repeatedly , and multiple features detected randomly but one at a time .",
    "if we detect @xmath35  features in  @xmath36 on average , are we detecting @xmath35  features of  @xmath33 with detection probability  1 , or @xmath37 features with detection probability  @xmath38 ?    once again , there is a need to correlate features across different instances of the construction .",
    "the union sequence comes to the rescue : @xmath39 in this case , the intersection sequence is not useful at the level of samples , because two sparse samples are unlikely to intersect very much .    the approach in this example is analogous to bootstrapping in statistics , where measurements on a large data set are estimated by making repeated measurements on a set of samples .    [ landmarking ] in computational topology , there exist several techniques for modelling a point cloud data set  @xmath33 by a simplicial complex  @xmath3 : the cech complex , the vietoris",
    " rips complex , the alpha complex  @xcite , the witness complex  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the witness complex @xmath40 , in particular , depends on the choice of a small subset of ` landmark ' points @xmath41 which will serve as the vertex set of  @xmath3 . roughly speaking , a simplex  @xmath42 with vertices in  @xmath43",
    "is included in @xmath44 if there is some @xmath45 which witnesses it , by being close to all the vertices .",
    "how does the witness complex @xmath40 depend on the choice of landmark set ?",
    "there is no direct way to compare @xmath40 with @xmath46 for two different choices of landmark sets @xmath47 .",
    "however , it turns out that one can define a witness _ bicomplex _",
    "@xmath48 which maps onto each witness complex .",
    "the cells are cartesian products @xmath49 , where @xmath50 have vertices in @xmath47 respectively .",
    "a cell @xmath49 is included provided that there exists @xmath45 which simultaneously witnesses @xmath42 for @xmath44 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .    given a sequence @xmath53 of landmark subsets , one can then construct the biwitness zigzag : @xmath54 long intervals in the zigzag barcode will then indicate features that persist across the corresponding range of choices of landmark set .",
    "the fundamental requirement is then for a way of assessing , in a zigzag diagram of vector spaces , the degree to which consistent families of elements exist .",
    "the point of this paper is that there is such methodology .",
    "we will interpret the isomorphism classes of zig - zag diagrams as a special case of the classification problem for quiver representations ( see @xcite for background on this theory ) .",
    "there turns out to be a theorem of gabriel  @xcite which classifies arbitrary diagrams based on dynkin diagrams , and which shows in particular that the set of isomorphism classes of zigzag diagrams of a given length is parametrised by barcodes  just as persistence modules are .",
    "long intervals in the classification define large families of consistent elements , hence indicate the presence of features stable across samples , landmark sets , or parameter values for a density estimator .      in section  [ sec : zigzags ]",
    "we describe the theory of decompositions of zigzag modules .",
    "these decompositions produce zigzag persistence barcodes analogous to the barcodes of persistent homology .",
    "the foundational theorem of gabriel is stated without proof . in section  [ sec : zigzag2filt ] we develop the machinery of right - filtrations , which turn out to be the right tool for accessing the decomposition structure of a zigzag module .",
    "this is an important section for the reader who wishes to make serious use of zigzag persistence . in section  [ sec :",
    "algorithms ] , we present a general - purpose algorithmic framework for calculating zigzag persistence , and we show how this operates in a practical class of examples . the algorithm is based on a proof of gabriel s theorem for zigzag modules , included for completeness .",
    "section  [ sec : further ] is devoted to a localisation principle which gives another approach to zigzag barcode calculations .",
    "we apply this to prove the diamond principle .",
    "we use this in turn to compare the zigzag barcodes for two natural zigzag diagrams obtained from a sequence of simplicial complexes .",
    "we work over a field @xmath19 which remains fixed throughout this paper .",
    "there is no significance to the choice of  @xmath19 .",
    "all vector spaces are finite - dimensional .",
    "let @xmath55 denote a sequence of vector spaces and linear maps , of length  @xmath35 : @xmath56 each @xmath57 represents either a forward map @xmath58 or a backward map @xmath59 .",
    "the object @xmath55 is called a * zigzag diagram * of vector spaces , or simply a * zigzag module * , over  @xmath19 .",
    "the sequence of symbols @xmath60 or @xmath61 is the * type * of  @xmath55 .",
    "for instance , a diagram of type @xmath62 looks like this : @xmath63 the length of a type  @xmath51 is the length of any diagram of type  @xmath51 .",
    "for example , we say that @xmath64 has length  4 .",
    "we will usually be considering zigzag modules of a fixed type  @xmath51 of length  @xmath35 .",
    "such diagrams are called * @xmath51-modules * , and the class of @xmath51-modules is denoted @xmath65 .",
    "* persistence modules * ( see  @xcite ) are zigzag modules where all the maps have the forward orientation ; in other words , where @xmath66 .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , persistence modules can be viewed as graded modules over the polynomial ring @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "this observation simplifies the analysis of persistence modules quite considerably .",
    "more generally , one can consider * graph representations * of arbitrary oriented graphs .",
    "zigzag modules constitute the special case where the graph is @xmath68 ( a path with @xmath35  vertices and @xmath69 edges ) and the orientation is specified by the type  @xmath51 . in 1972 , gabriel showed that the dynkin  coxeter graphs @xmath68 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( arbitrarily oriented ) have an especially well - behaved representation theory  @xcite .",
    "the theory of * quivers * was launched from this starting block ; see  @xcite for a beautiful and transparent introduction .",
    "zigzag persistence is enabled by the good behaviour of @xmath68 graph representations .",
    "@xmath65 has the structure of an abelian category .",
    "given two @xmath51-modules @xmath74 , a morphism @xmath75 is defined to be a collection of linear maps @xmath76 which satisfy the commutation relations @xmath77 or @xmath78 for each  @xmath79 .",
    "( here the forward and backward maps for  @xmath80 are written @xmath81 respectively . )",
    "morphisms can be composed in the obvious way , and have kernels , images , and cokernels : for instance @xmath82 is the @xmath51-module with spaces @xmath83 and maps @xmath84 and @xmath85 defined by restriction .",
    "the set of morphisms @xmath86 is naturally a vector space over  @xmath19 , and the endomorphism ring @xmath87 is a non - commutative @xmath19-algebra .",
    "we can view @xmath88 as the subalgebra of @xmath89 defined by the commutation relations .",
    "we wish to understand zigzag modules by decomposing them into simpler parts .",
    "accordingly , a * submodule * @xmath80 of a @xmath51-module  @xmath55 is defined by subspaces @xmath90 such that @xmath91 or @xmath92 for all  @xmath79 .",
    "these conditions guarantee that @xmath80 is itself a @xmath51-module , with maps given by the restrictions @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "we write @xmath95 .",
    "a submodule  @xmath80 is called a * summand * of  @xmath55 if there exists a submodule @xmath96 which is complementary to  @xmath80 , in the sense that @xmath97 for all  @xmath79 . in that case",
    ", we say that @xmath55 is the * direct sum * of @xmath98 and write @xmath99 .    as a rule ,",
    "most submodules are not summands .",
    "@xmath100 has the submodule @xmath101 .",
    "however , @xmath80 is not a summand because the only possible complement is @xmath102 , and that is not a submodule of  @xmath55 .",
    "the direct sum can also be defined as an ` external ' operation : given @xmath51-modules @xmath74 their direct sum @xmath103 is defined to be the @xmath51-module with spaces @xmath104 and maps @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "( here the forward and backward maps for  @xmath80 are written @xmath81 respectively . )",
    "a @xmath51-module @xmath55 is * decomposable * if it can be written as a direct sum of nonzero submodules , and * indecomposable * otherwise .",
    "any @xmath51-module @xmath55 has a * remak decomposition * ; in other words we can write @xmath107 , where the summands @xmath108 are indecomposable .",
    "the existence of such a decomposition is proved by induction on the total dimension @xmath109 : if @xmath55 is decomposable , say @xmath99 , then we may assume inductively that @xmath98 have remak decompositions , and therefore so does  @xmath55 .",
    "( base case : if @xmath55 is indecomposable , then it has a remak decomposition with one term . )    remak decompositions themselves are not unique .",
    "however , the krull ",
    "schmidt principle from commutative algebra tells us that the summands in a remak decomposition are unique up to reordering :    ( krull  remak  schmidt . ) [ prop : krull ] suppose a @xmath51-module @xmath55 has remak decompositions @xmath110 then @xmath111 and there is some permutation  @xmath42 of @xmath112 such that @xmath113 for all  @xmath114 .",
    "the proof of theorem  7.5 of lang  @xcite , which is stated for modules in the ordinary sense , can be applied verbatim to our present context ; all the required algebraic operations can be carried out within @xmath88 .",
    "since our @xmath51-modules have finite total dimension , the ascending and descending chain conditions ( acc and dcc ) are automatic .    for further context",
    ", we refer the reader to an elegant article by atiyah  @xcite ; the krull ",
    "schmidt principle applies in any exact abelian category to objects which satisfy acc and dcc , or a weaker ` bi - chain condition ' defined by atiyah . our category , @xmath65 ,",
    "is included by this formulation .",
    "thus we can use the multiset @xmath115 as an isomorphism invariant of  @xmath55 . for this to be useful",
    ", we need to identify the set of indecomposable @xmath51-modules .",
    "we now describe a natural collection of indecomposables . for each subinterval",
    "@xmath116 $ ] of the integer sequence @xmath117 there is an associated @xmath51-module .",
    "let @xmath51 be a type of length  @xmath35 and consider integers @xmath118 .",
    "the * interval * @xmath51-module with birth time  @xmath119 and death time  @xmath120 is written @xmath121 and defined with spaces @xmath122 and with identity maps between adjacent copies of @xmath19 , and zero maps otherwise .",
    "when @xmath51 is implicit , we will usually suppress it and simply write @xmath123 .    if @xmath62 then @xmath124 is the zigzag module @xmath125    [ prop : intind ] interval @xmath51-modules are indecomposable .",
    "suppose @xmath126 and consider two adjacent terms  @xmath19 connected by an identity map . since @xmath74 are submodules , the dimensions of @xmath55 and @xmath80 can not decrease in the direction of the map ; nor , since they are complements , can they increase .",
    "thus @xmath127 and @xmath128 are constant over @xmath129 , and in particular one of @xmath130 must be zero .    here",

    "this is the simplest special case of gabriel s theorem , for the graphs @xmath68 .",
    "the original reference ( in german ) is  @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite for an accessible overview .",
    "thus , any @xmath51-module can be described completely up to isomorphism as an unordered list of intervals @xmath116 $ ] , which correspond to its indecomposable summands .",
    "this is in exact accordance with the special case of ordinary persistence , where the result is comparatively easy to prove : it is simply the classification of finitely - generated graded modules over the polynomial ring @xmath67 $ ] ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the philosophical point is that the decomposition theory of graph representations is somewhat independent of the orientation of the graph edges ( see kac  @xcite ) . even in our case",
    "this is surprising , because there is no obvious congruence between persistence modules and zigzag modules of an arbitrary type  @xmath51 .",
    "however , if we accept this principle , then the generalisation from ordinary persistence to zigzag persistence is not surprising : interval decomposition for persistence modules implies interval decomposition for zigzag modules .",
    "we will devote much of this paper to constructing a stand - alone proof of theorem  [ thm : interval ] .",
