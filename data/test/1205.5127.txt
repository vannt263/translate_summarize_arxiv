    "the modern technological progress in ultrafast optics makes it possible to produce few - cycle laser pulses @xcite . recently",
    ", a single - cycle pulse with a duration of 4.3 femtoseconds has been generated experimentally @xcite .",
    "furthermore , great effort for the generation of extremely short pulses via few - cycle laser pulses has been made @xcite , particularly , single - cycle gap solitons @xcite and unipolar half - cycle optical pulses @xcite , respectively , generated in the dense media with a subwavelength structure . if the pulse duration approaches the optical cycle , the strong - field - matter interaction enters into the extreme nonlinear optics @xcite , and the standard approximations of the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) , and the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) are invalid @xcite .",
    "when the rabi frequency of the few - cycle laser pulse becomes comparable to the light frequency , the electric field time - derivative effects will lead to carrier - wave rabi flopping ( cwrf ) @xcite , which was observed experimentally in the semiconductor gaas sample @xcite . in this extreme pumping regime ,",
    "the simple two - level system can still serve as a reference point @xcite .",
    "for the few - cycle laser pulses , the absolute carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) strongly affects the temporal variation of the electric field .",
    "these effects give rise to many cep dependent dynamics , such as high - harmonic generation @xcite , optical field ionization @xcite , atomic coherence and population transfer @xcite , etc .",
    "the cep dependent strong interactions also provide routines to determine the cep of few - cycle ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "in particular , the strong - field photoionization provides very efficient tools to measure the cep of powerful few - cycle femtosecond laser pulses for the first time @xcite .",
    "another promising approach to determine the cep is introduced on the detection of the thz emission by down - conversion from the few - cycle strong laser pulse @xcite .",
    "recently , the angular distribution of the photons emitted by an ultra - relativistic accelerated electron also provides a direct way of determining the carrier - envelope phase of the driving laser field @xcite . however , all these measurements of cep are based on light amplification in strong - field regime .",
    "therefore , it is very meaningful to explore routines for determining the cep of few - cycle laser pulse at relative lower intensities without light amplification .",
    "the nonperturbative resonant extreme nonlinear optics effects would be good candidates for measuring the cep of few - cycle laser pulses with moderate intensities @xcite .",
    "however , the period of these cep - dependent effects is @xmath0 due to the inversion symmetry of light - matter interaction in two - level systems .",
    "thus , the sign of the few - cycle laser pulse still can not be determined . in order to remove the @xmath0-shift phase ambiguity , the violation of inversion symmetry",
    "should be considered @xcite . in the presence of an electrical bias",
    ", the phase - dependent signal of ultrafast optical rectification in a direct - gap semiconductor film implies a possible technique to extract the cep @xcite .",
    "moreover , the inversion - asymmetry media , such as polar molecules @xcite and the asymmetric quantum well @xcite , could also be utilized to determine the cep of few - cycle laser pulses .",

    "the crt should be considered for such ultrashort pulses interacting with the medium with strong relaxation processes , because the crt can notably suppress the broadening of the pulse envelope and the decrease of the group velocity arising from dispersion .",
    "furthermore , when the incident single - cycle pulse with envelope area @xmath2 propagates throngh the two - level medium , it splits into two pulses .",
    "the stronger main pulse moves faster than the weaker generated soliton pulse , and the pulse time - delay between them shows a pronounced cep dependence .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a static electric field , we present a simpler approach for measuring the cep of the few - cycle laser pulses , by detecting the time - delay of the generated soliton pulse .",
    "we consider the propagation of a few - cycle laser pulse in a resonant two - level medium along the @xmath3 axis , as shown in fig .",
    "the pulse initially moves in the free - space region , then it penetrates the medium on an input interface at @xmath4 and propagates through the medium , and finally , it exits again into the free space through the output interface at @xmath5 . with the constitute relation for the electric displacement for the linear polarization along the @xmath6 axis , @xmath7 , the full - wave maxwell equations for the medium take the form :    [ max ] @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electric and magnetic fields , respectively . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the magnetic permeability and the electric permittivity in the vacuum , respectively . the macroscopic nonlinear polarization @xmath13 is connected with the off - diagonal density matrix element @xmath14 and the population inversion @xmath15 , which are determined by the bloch equations below .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two - level system we considered can be described by @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the transition frequency , and @xmath18 is the electric dipole moment of the transition between the upper state @xmath19 and the lower state @xmath20 .",

    "the electric - field pulse from the approach with crt [ blue solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] is evidently narrower than that in the case without crt [ red dashed curves in fig .  [ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "this can be easily seen from the corresponding spectra shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum of the case with crt is obviously more broadened than that in the case without crt , although both of them become narrower than the incident spectrum .",
    "the envelope peak from the approach with crt is relatively larger than that in the case without crt [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] , hence , the former case lead to more population inversion at the leading edge of the electric - field pulse [ fig .",

    "moreover , there is a notably time delay of the electric - field pulses and the corresponding population inversions between the two approaches [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "it means that the group velocity of the propagating pulse from the conventional approach without crt is obviously smaller than that in the case with crt .",
    "this difference in the group velocity is rooted from the different influence of dispersion effects for these two approaches .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ bloch - crt ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) , there is no damping of the real part of polarization @xmath70 in the bloch equations with crt , which indicates that the dispersion does not suffer lossness .",
    "that is to say , the presence of crt evidently suppresses the strong dispersion effects , which lead to the broadening of pulse envelope and the decrease of the group velocity .",
    "in addition , we also find that the influence of crt on the propagation dynamics of the single - cycle laser pulses is significantly enhanced with the increase of the spontaneous decay rates .",
    "therefore , the crt is important and indispensable for the study of the propagation properties of few - cycle laser pulses in the medium with strong relaxation processes . in the following discussion",

    "what follows , we simulate the incident single - cycle pulses with larger envelope area , i.e. @xmath2 , propagating through the two - level medium with a length @xmath69 . during the course of pulse propagation",
    ", the medium absorbs and emits photons and redistributes energy in the pulse .",
    "the propagating pulses are altered in shape until it reaches a stable status after some propagation distance by splitting into two pulses , the strong main pulse and the sit soliton pulse . however , the former moves faster than the latter , which is why the generated sit soliton pulse breaks up from the main pulse .",
    "we show the transmitted pulses of the incident single - cycle pulse with pulse envelope area @xmath2 for different cep @xmath71 and @xmath72 in fig .",
    "it can be seen that both of the transmitted pulses split into two pulses .",
    "there is a time delay between the main pulse and the soliton pulse defined as @xmath73 .",
    "the time - delay for the incident pulse with cep @xmath72 [ @xmath74 is evidently larger than that in the case with cep @xmath71 [ @xmath75 .",
    "it demonstrates that the pulse time delay @xmath73 is sensitive to the initial cep of the incident pulse .    for simplicity , we define the relative pulse time delay @xmath76 to indicate the cep dependence .",
    "we present the relative pulse time delay @xmath77 as a function of the initial cep of the incident pulse in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] with blue circles .",
    "it is found that the relative pulse time delay @xmath77 is related to the cep of the incident pulse with a nearly cosinelike dependence .",
    "the time delay @xmath78 is exactly the same as @xmath79 , and hence , the period of the cep - dependent pulse time delay is only @xmath0 because of the inversion symmetry of light - matter interaction .",
    "this means that we can not distinguish the incident pulse from the initial cep @xmath80 .     the relative pulse delay between the transmitted soliton pulses as a function of the cep of the incident pulses for different strengths of the static electric field .",
    "the solid lines are a guide for the eyes.,width=302 ]    in order to remove the @xmath0-shift phase ambiguity , we add a static electric field to break the inversion symmetry of the light - matter interaction @xcite . as a result , the rabi frequency terms in bloch equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ bloch - crt ] ) ] should change as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 describes the strength of the static electric field .",
    "the presence of the static electric field gives rise to the enhancement of the cep - dependent variation in the peak electric strength of the single - cycle pulse , which will enhance the cep dependence of the dynamics effects .",
    "the relative pulse time delay @xmath77 of the transmitted soliton pulses as a function of the initial cep of the incident single - cycle pulses for different static electric fields is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . compared with the blue circles of @xmath83 ,",
    "the influence of the static electric field on the relative pulse time delay is significant .",
    "let us take @xmath84 , for example green squares in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , then the relative time delay @xmath85 at @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath78 is quite different from @xmath79 in the presence of the static electric field .",
    "the variation with the cep of the incident pusle also becomes much stronger .",
    "the period of the cep - dependent pulse time delay becomes @xmath66 because the inversion symmetry is broken assisted by the static electric field .",
    "moreover , with the increase of the static electric field , such as @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the dependence of the relative pulse time delay on the initial cep is further enhanced [ red diamond and black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ] .    as a result ,",
    "in the presence of the static electric field , if the relative time delay of the generated soliton pulses is calibrated , this effect suggests an approach for determining the cep of the incident single - cycle laser pulses in both sign and amplitude .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that the pulse time delay might be much easier to detect compared with other features of the soliton pulse , such as the intensity and pulse duration @xcite . finally , in our discussion , the static electric filed strengths , which are a few percentages of the single cycle laser pulse strength , exceed a few mv / cm . in order to achieve this kind of strength of the static electric field in an experiment , we may proceed with a special case as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where an additional electric field with a much lower frequency ( such as @xmath89 laser field , terahertz pulses or a midinfrared optical parameter amplifier pulse ) is used instead of the static electric field .",
    "the ultra - short dynamics can prevent the system from being destroyed or ionized .",
    "in summary , we investigated the propagation properties of single - cycle laser pulses in a two - level medium including the counter - rotating terms in the spontaneous emission damping .",
    "we found that the counter - rotating term can efficiently suppress the broadening of the pulse envelope and the decrease of the group velocity .",
    "thus , the counter - rotating term is important and indispensable for the study of the propagation dynamics of few - cycle laser pulses , even for single - cycle and sub - cycle pulses . furthermore , we explored the cep - dependence of the generated soliton pulse from the single - cycle laser pulse propagating through the two - level medium .",
    "the time delay of generated soliton pulses depends sensitively on the cep of single - cycle incident laser pulse .",
    "hence , the presence of the static electric field enhances the cep - dependence of the relative pulse time delay , which have an potential application in determining the cep of the incident single - cycle laser pulse .",
