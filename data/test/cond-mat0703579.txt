    "since their discovery , josephson effects play a central role in the investigation of the superconducting state because of their fundamental as well as technical relevance .",
    "josephson effects occur whenever two extended superconducting banks are weakly coupled and can be observed , among many other systems , across a geometric constriction of a superconductor with lateral dimensions much smaller than the coherence length .",
    "this kind of josephson junction , usually referred to as scs junction , has promising properties for highly sensitive magnetometers  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in microfabrication technique allows to pattern high quality niobium thin films with structures small enough for constriction - type josephson junctions  @xcite . at the same time , a scs josephson junction is a useful basis for theoretical considerations because only the properties of the superconductor and its geometry are relevant .",
    "superconducting point contacts serve as a simplified model for scs junctions and have been investigated by many authors .",
    "an overview of many useful results for the ac and dc josephson effect can be found in the reviews by likharev  @xcite and golubov et al .",
    "the most general result was derived by zaitsev  @xcite and includes a large number of conduction channels as well as asymmetry and non - bcs structure of the electrodes .",
    "+ microscopic theory for the dc josephson effect in a model mesoscopic constriction has been presented in  @xcite with the restriction to a small number of conducting channels in the constriction .",
    "this model clarified the relevance of andreev bound states for the supercurrents in the junction .",
    "analytic solutions of microscopic theory for the dc josephson effect in a ballistic superconducting microconstriction have been presented in  @xcite . in this approach , the influence of the constriction length on the critical current has been calculated self - consistently for temperatures close to @xmath2 .    as already stated by kulik",
    "@xcite and ishii  @xcite , a more detailed physical picture of cooper pair tunneling in josephson junctions involves andreev reflection  @xcite at the interfaces between the weak link and the electrodes . due to this picture ,",
    "andreev bound states in josephson junctions represent electron and hole waves that bounce back and forth between the two electrodes constructively , transferring one cooper pair in every cycle .",
    "thus , cooper pair transfer across josephson junctions is mediated by andreev bound states . with this view in mind ,",
    "detailed knowledge of the local density of states ( ldos ) in the vicinity of the weak link is essential .",
    "this fact has led to the consideration of the ldos in different types of josephson junctions : among others , see @xcite for scs , @xcite for sns , @xcite for sns and sis and @xcite for sns and sfs with s- and d - wave pairing symmetry ( n = normal conductor , i = isolator , f = ferromagnet ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we examine a two - dimensional model of a scs josephson junction in order to investigate the dependence of the dc josephson effect on temperature , on geometric parameters as well as the influence of magnetic fields , external ones as well as those generated by the supercurrents flowing in the junction .",
    "therefore , we will numerically solve microscopic eilenberger theory self - consistently for a conventional ( s - wave ) superconducting junction in the clean limit . in order to achieve electromagnetic self - consistency as well ,",
    "we employ a convenient method to calculate the magnetic field evoked by the supercurrents . this will allow us to derive transport properties for a realistic geometry at arbitrary temperature and arbitrary external magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the method used to solve microscopic eilenberger theory self - consistently including magnetic fields presented in this paper can be applied to more complex geometries and thus might be of more general interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce our geometric model . in section",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we present the theoretical background for our calculations and explain how we solve the relevant equations . in section  [ sec : comp ] , we compare our results to previous ones in order to test our methods . in section  [ sec : jeffectinscs ] , we present representative results and explain how the josephson effect emerges in scs junctions . in the following ,",
    "we consider the influence of the temperature and geometric parameters ( section  [ sec : geometry ] ) , of @xmath0 ( [ sec : kappa ] ) and of external magnetic fields ( [ sec : bext ] ) . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we close with some concluding remarks .",
    "for the calculations presented in this paper , we use a two - dimensional model of a scs josephson junction as depicted in fig.[cap : geometry ] .",
    "the geometry consists of a long superconducting channel which is narrowed down by a constriction .",
    "we will calculate all relevant quantities on a section of the channel enclosing the constriction with length @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the coherence length ) .",
    "on the left and right end of this section , the phase of the order parameter will be set to @xmath5 .",
    "the width of the channel will be set to @xmath6 throughout the paper whilst the constriction is defined by the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 as can be seen in the figure .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath9 is oriented perpendicular to the two - dimensional structure .",
    "since we assume the fermi surface to be cylindrical with the symmetry axis parallel to the @xmath10 direction , we can restrict our calculations to the @xmath11 plane .",
    "the results are applicable to films of arbitrary thickness with an appropriate value for the london penetration depth  @xcite .",
    "our results correspond to the symmetry plane at half the extension of the sample in the @xmath10 direction and , accordingly , magnetic fields are oriented parallel to @xmath12 .     two - dimensional model for a scs josephson junction consisting of a long channel ( width @xmath6 throughout the paper ) with a constriction .",
    "the constriction is defined by the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "our calculations have been carried out for a section of the channel with length @xmath3 ( dark grey area ) and fixed phase difference of the order parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the image plane ( along the @xmath10 axis ) . ]",
    "our calculations are based on quasiclassical eilenberger theory  @xcite which we solve self - consistently including the magnetic vector potential . to obtain josephson weak link behaviour ,",
    "it is essential to calculate the order parameter self - consistently .",
    "a self - consistent solution contains local modulations of the order parameter amplitude and can thus yield local suppression of superconductivity . local suppression of superconductivity in turn constitutes a josephson weak link .",
    "+ to solve quasiclassical eilenberger theory self - consistently , we have to find solutions for the order parameter @xmath14 and the supercurrent @xmath15 which satisfy the two self - consistency conditions : @xmath16 these two equations , the gap equation and the current equation , contain the components of the quasiclassical propagator @xmath17 and @xmath18 which , in turn , can be expressed in terms of two complex quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 called the riccati amplitudes  @xcite : @xmath21 the riccati amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are solutions to the riccati differential equations :    [ eq : riccatipde ] @xmath22\\ , a(x)-\\delta(\\vec{r}(x ) ) & = & 0\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : riccatipdea } \\\\",

    "the gradient of the order parameter phase @xmath28 together with the magnetic vector potential @xmath29 consitute the gauge - invariant superfluid velocity @xmath30 : @xmath31 in the following subsection , we will describe the procedure how we calculate the magnetic vector potential @xmath29 .",
    "the distribution of the order parameter phase @xmath32 follows from the solution of the gap equation which , together with the current equation  ( [ eq : curreq ] ) , minimizes free energy .",
    "thus , the way we calculate the magnetic vector potential makes use of the freedom of gauge , but after choosing a certain way to calculate @xmath29 , the order parameter phase is uniquely defined by the self - consistent solution of the gap and the current equation .    to obtain stable solutions ,",
    "the riccati equation for @xmath19 has to be integrated along @xmath33 whereas the riccati equation for @xmath20 in the opposite direction .",
    "appropriate initial values for the integration of the riccati differential equations can be constructed by dropping the gradient terms . for @xmath34 ,",
    "this yields    [ eq : abasymp]@xmath35    for the evaluation of the right hand side of the gap and the current equation , the components of the quasiclassical propagator @xmath36 and @xmath18 constructed with the riccati amplitudes according to equations ( [ eq : riccatiparamf ] ) and ( [ eq : riccatiparamg ] ) have to be averaged over the fermi surface of the superconducting material ( denoted with @xmath37 ) .",
    "as stated above , we assume the fermi surface to be cylindrical with the symmetry axis along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "finally , these averaged quantities have to be summed over all matsubara frequencies @xmath38 smaller than the cutoff @xmath39 . for our calculations",
    ", we use a cutoff of @xmath40 which is sufficiently large for the results to be independent of @xmath39 .",
    "apart from the left and right end of the channel section , all other boundaries of the geometry are assumed to be impenetrable .",
    "thus , we can apply the general boundary conditions for the riccati amplitudes given by shelankov and ozana  @xcite in a very simple form .",
    "vanishing transmissibility leads to specular reflection of the trajectories ( outgoing angle is equal to incident angle ) and to the conservation of the riccati amplitudes .",
    "+ the optical behaviour of the trajectories makes it necessary to implement a two - dimensional raytracing procedure .",
    "depending on position and angle , this leads to multiple reflections of the trajectories within the geometry .",
    "a similar raytracing procedure for the riccati equations has been used in  @xcite to calculate the local density of states at polygonal boundaries of d - wave superconductors . in our case , the trajectories can be terminated either if the left or right channel end have been reached or if the length of the trajectory is sufficient for the results of the integration to be independent of the initial values .    to solve the above equations , we discretize the area of the channel section and solve the equations at the grid nodes .",
    "numerical costs can be reduced significantly by a local variation of the grid width . in the direct vicinity of the constriction ,",
    "a rather fine grid is needed whereas less nodes are sufficient in the channel .      to account for magnetic fields , the two self - consistency equations ( [ eq : gapeq ] ) and ( [ eq : curreq ] ) have to be completed by the maxwell equation @xmath41 and the definition of the magnetic vector potential @xmath42 the total magnetic vector potential has two contributions .",
    "first , there is the contribution @xmath43 which represents the externally applied magnetic field .",
    "second , the supercurrents flowing in the junction cause a magnetic vector potential @xmath44 . combining both yields the total magnetic vector potential : @xmath45 choosing coulomb gauge @xmath46",
    ", it follows from  ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) and  ( [ eq : magvecpotdef ] ) for the contribution evoked by the supercurrents that @xmath47 in order to solve this poisson equation for the magnetic vector potential @xmath44 , we use the two - dimensional green s function of the laplacian .",
    "this leads to @xmath48 free space boundary conditions for @xmath49 are contained in the green s function whereas the behaviour in the vicinity of the sample is determined by the self - consistency conditions ( [ eq : gapeq ] ) and ( [ eq : curreq ] ) , see subsection  [ sub : iterations ] . in a two - dimensional discretization of the geometry ,",
    "this integral can easily be solved analytically for each grid cell and then summed over all cells .",
    "in order to have consistent behaviour of the magnetic vector potential at the connection to the long channel , we assume the currents to be constant away from the constriction ( for @xmath50 ) and also integrate over these in equation  ( [ eq : afromcurrs ] ) . + after calculating the magnetic vector potential @xmath51 from the supercurrents via eq.([eq : afromcurrs ] ) , we make use of the freedom of gauge .",
    "the phase gradients of the order parameter @xmath28 together with the total magnetic vector potential @xmath29 lead to the final form of the supercurrents ( see eq.([eq : dopplervs ] ) ) .",
    "this implies that the resulting phase gradients depend on the form of the magnetic vector potential and vice versa . to minimize both the phase gradients and the magnetic vector potential",
    ", we shift the vector potential @xmath51 to minimal absolute values .",
    "this can be done via a simple homogeneous offset which neither changes the corresponding magnetic field @xmath52 nor conflicts with the poisson equation([eq : apoisson ] ) . minimizing the absolute values of the phase gradient and",
    "the magnetic vector potential leads to more robust convergence of the iterative procedure which we use to solve the gap and the current equation .",
    "this iterative procedure will be described in detail in subsection  [ sub : iterations ] .    to complete the total magnetic vector potential ,",
    "we include external magnetic fields @xmath9 via @xmath53 which complies with the coulomb gauge chosen for the magnetic vector potential @xmath54 and which minimizes absolute values .      in the problem considered in the present work , two factors leading to pair",
    "breaking are relevant .",
    "first , a phase difference is applied which leads to a transport current and thus suppresses superconductivity .",
    "second , the external magnetic field leads to screening currents and pair breaking .",
    "in order to apply correct boundary conditions at the connection to the channel , these two effects have to be clearly separated .",
    "since we study josephson junction behaviour , the maximum transport current will be given by the josephson critical current which is much lower than the critical current of a massive superconducting lead .",
    "thus , the transport current will not significantly lower the gap amplitude in the channel , far away from the constriction . for vanishing external magnetic field",
    ", it is therefore a very good approximation to use the temperature dependent bulk gap amplitude @xmath55 as boundary condition at the left and right end of the section of the channel enclosing the constriction .",
    "furthermore , for vanishing external magnetic field , the phase is homogeneous over the cross section of the channel and a phase difference can easily be applied by setting the phase boundary conditions to @xmath56 .",
    "the situation changes in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field leads to screening currents and lowers the gap amplitude in the channel . to gain correct behaviour for higher magnetic fields ,",
    "it is thus essential to include the lowering of the gap amplitude in the channel . with an external magnetic field",
    ", we thus proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we self - consistently calculate the amplitude and phase of the order parameter for zero transport current ( corresponding to zero phase difference ) without any boundary conditions at the left and right section ends .",
    "this will give us the correct self - consistent solution with screening but without transport currents and allows for a lowering of the gap amplitude as well as for variations of the phase over the cross section of the channel .",
    "in the second step , we use the amplitude and phase of the order parameter found at the left and right section end in the first step as boundary conditions for finite transport current .",
    "therefore , the phase has to be shifted by @xmath57 at the left section end and by @xmath58 at the right section end whereas the amplitude has to be retained .",
    "herewith , the pair - breaking influence of the external magnetic field and the screening currents is included for all amplitudes of the transport current .",
    "this two - step procedure has to be repeated for every value of the magnetic field .",
    "the gradients of the order parameter phase @xmath28 together with the magnetic vector potential @xmath29 constitute the gauge - invariant superfluid velocity @xmath30 given in eq.([eq : dopplervs ] ) .",
    "the current - phase relation thus has to be expressed in terms of the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath59 with @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the flux quantum and @xmath62 indicate the left and right section end .",
    "let us now comment on how we gain the self - consistent solutions for the order parameter @xmath14 , the supercurrents @xmath15 and the magnetic vector potential @xmath29 .",
    "the self - consistency equations ( [ eq : gapeq ] ) and ( [ eq : curreq ] ) serve as iteration rules with which we improve an initial guess on a discrete grid . in each iterative step",
    ", we first have to solve the riccati equations ( [ eq : riccatipde ] ) for all matsubara frequencies @xmath63 and all fermi velocities @xmath64 at every grid node .",
    "second , we construct @xmath17 and @xmath18 from the solutions for @xmath19 and @xmath20 via ( [ eq : riccatiparamf ] ) and ( [ eq : riccatiparamg ] ) and plug these into the gap ( [ eq : gapeq ] ) and current equation ( [ eq : curreq ] ) .",
    "third , we calculate the magnetic vector potential @xmath51 caused by the supercurrents via ( [ eq : afromcurrs ] ) and construct the total magnetic vector potential @xmath54 according to  ( [ eq : atot ] ) . with the new configurations for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath29 , we can attempt the next iterative cycle .",
    "this iterative procedure has to be repeated until convergence .",
    "two criteria can be utilized to determine the level of self - consistency of the solution .",
    "it is straightforward to observe the change of the functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath29 in every iterative step and to continue until it is sufficiently small . since the rate of convergence in a single iteration can be very small",
    ", a more significant approach is to verify current conservation which provides a stringent test of self - consistency  @xcite .    in the formulation of the microscopic eilenberger equations used in the present work , the order parameter in the gap equation retains a complex quantity .",
    "thus , iterating the gap equation yields both the amplitude and the phase distribution of the order parameter self - consistently .",
    "the magnetic vector potential is calculated from the currents and the external magnetic field in every iteration and the system of equations is thus solved entirely self - consistent including the magnetic vector potential .    at first sight , the free space green s function  ( [ eq : afromcurrs ] ) for the magnetic vector potential does not provide boundary conditions for the surface of the geometry .",
    "since the green s function  ( [ eq : afromcurrs ] ) is embedded in a self - consistent calculation , the compliance with the boundary conditions is ensured by the gap  ( [ eq : gapeq ] ) and the current equation  ( [ eq : curreq ] ) .",
    "a self - consistent solution of the eilenberger equations automatically leads to @xmath65 and respect of the boundary conditions at the surface of the superconductor ( @xmath66 with the surface normal @xmath67 ) .",
    "since , in the self - consistent calculation , the magnetic vector potential depends on the currents and vice versa , the correct behaviour of the magnetic vector potential including @xmath68 follows . embedding the green s function  ( [ eq : afromcurrs ] ) in the self - consistent calculation",
    "thus liberates us from the explicit formulation of boundary conditions for the magnetic vector potential .",
    "it should be noted that an iterative algorithm usually produces stable solutions . as discussed in  @xcite , unstable solutions corresponding to saddle points of the free energy",
    "can only be reached with more elaborate methods . however , since we are only interested in stable solutions , an iterative approach is controllable and straightforward .",
    "once a self - consistent configuration of the order parameter , the supercurrents and the magnetic vector potential has been found , the normalized local density of states follows via @xmath69 \\big>_{fs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the definitions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 introduced above  @xcite .",
    "all quantities with the dimension of an energy will be normalized to @xmath72 .",
    "the characteristic lengthscale we use to normalize all lengths is @xmath73 .",
    "total currents ( integrated over the cross - section of the channel ) will be given in terms of @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "+ with @xmath0 and the london penetration depth @xmath76 , we use @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "+ applying these normalizations , equation  ( [ eq : apoisson ] ) becomes @xmath79 thus , it is obvious that for reasonably large values of @xmath1 , the magnetic vector potential evoked by the currents can be neglected and electromagnetic self - consistency becomes unimportant .",
    "nevertheless , for smaller values of @xmath1 , magnetic fields become increasingly important and have to be included in the calculations .",
    "as a first test of our approach and our numerical code , we compare our results with those of ginzburg - landau theory presented in chapter 4.4 of tinkham s textbook  @xcite .",
    "there , one can find results for the critical current of a thin wire or film . in order to compare our results with these calculations ,",
    "we remove the constriction ( @xmath80 ) and consider temperatures close to @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , we have to change our boundary conditions slightly in order to allow for suppression of superconductivity in the channel at high transport current densities .",
    "this can easily be done via periodic boundary conditions at the left and right end of the channel section .",
    "after these minor changes , our program is ready to consider a long thin wire or film and our results perfectly match those from ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the same results for the critical current can also be achieved by a simple doppler shift calculation  @xcite , i.e. solving the bulk gap and current equation with a homogeneous phase gradient @xmath81 this consideration provides a second verification .    as a third test",

    "<S> self - consistent solutions of microscopic eilenberger theory are presented for a two - dimensional model of a superconducting channel with a geometric constriction . </S>",

    "<S> as long as the london penetration depth is comparable to or bigger than the extension of the constriction , the josephson effect is independent of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the weak link is very insensitive to external magnetic fields . </S>",
