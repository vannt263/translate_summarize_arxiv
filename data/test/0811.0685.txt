    "spin - sensitive andreev reflection in superconducting hybrid structures yields a number of interesting and non - trivial effects which have been addressed and studied in the literature .",
    "already more than three decades ago it was realized that spin - flip electron tunneling through a magnetic interface between two superconductors may cause a sign change of the josephson current and yield the so - called @xmath0-junction state in superconducting weak links @xcite .",
    "the same effect can also occur in superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sfs ) junctions where the josephson critical current was predicted to oscillate as a function of the ferromagnet layer thickness also leading to formation of the @xmath0-junction state @xcite .",
    "these theoretical predictions were confirmed in experiments with sfs junctions @xcite .",
    "more recently it was realized @xcite that the cooper pair wave function in sf hybrids may change its symmetry from a singlet in a superconductor to a triplet in a ferromagnet .",
    "this so - called odd - frequency pairing state @xcite implies that cooper pairs can penetrate deep into the ferromagnet thus causing the long range proximity effect in sf systems .",
    "experimental evidence for such long range coherent behavior of sf hybrids was discussed in ref . .",
    "another interesting realization of this long range proximity effect is the possibility for non - vanishing josephson current to flow across superconducting weak links containing strong ferromagnets or the so - called half - metals ( h ) .",
    "note that spin - singlet cooper pairs can not penetrate into h - metals because such metals are fully spin polarized materials acting as insulators for electrons with one of the two spin directions .",
    "hence , no supercurrent carried by spin - singlet cooper pairs can occur in shs junctions .",
    "superconducting correlations can nevertheless survive deep inside strong ferromagnets provided there exists a mechanism for spin - flip scattering at both hs interfaces of the junction .",
    "this mechanism allows for conversion of spin - singlet pairing in s - electrodes into spin - triplet pairing in h - metals thus making it possible for the supercurrent to flow across the system .",
    "a theory of this non - trivial josephson effect in shs junctions was recently addressed by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "experimental results @xcite appear to support that non - vanishing supercurrent can indeed flow across sufficiently thick shs junctions .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to develop a general theory of dc josephson effect in sns heterostructures with spin - active interfaces .",
    "previously @xcite we already demonstrated that spin - dependent scattering at such interfaces yields a number of interesting and non - trivial properties of non - local andreev reflection in three - terminal nsn devices .",
    "here we find that both the josephson critical current and the current - phase relation in sns junctions are very sensitive to particular values of ( @xmath1 ) spin - dependent interface transmissions , ( @xmath2 ) spin - mixing angles and ( @xmath3 ) the electron kinematic phase showing a rich variety of features which can be detected and studied in future experiments .",
    "one possible experimental realization of sns junctions with spin - active interfaces is achieved by placing a thin layer of some magnetic material at the interfaces between superconducting and normal metals . in this case transmission probabilities for spin - up and spin - down electrons propagating through such interfaces may take different values .",
    "in addition , the scattering phase of incoming electrons may also depend on their spin states .",
    "this physical situation can be modelled by a spin - active interface described by two ( spin - up and spin - down ) transmission probabilities and by the so - called spin - mixing angle which is just the difference between the scattering phases for the spin - up and spin - down states of incoming electrons .",
    "yet one more parameter  the kinematic phase  should be introduced in order to account for the phase acquired by an electron between successive scattering events at ns interfaces .",
    "this phase is essentially set by the product of the fermi momentum and the distance covered by an electron between two scattering events .",
    "since the electron momentum can be controlled ( shifted ) by applying the gate voltage the system can be periodically driven to and out of resonance thereby rendering a possibility to experimentally investigate the dependence of the josephson current on the kinematic phase .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we will define our model and specify some key equations that will be employed in our further consideration .",
    "is devoted to the analysis of andreev bound states in sns junctions with spin - active interfaces . in sec .",
    "4 we will demonstrate that the josephson current in our structure can be directly expressed in terms of the andreev spectrum and derive the general expression for this current .",
    "this expression will then be analyzed in sec .",
    "5 in a number of interesting limits . in sec . 6",
    "we will briefly summarize our main observations .",
    "some technical details of our analysis will be presented in appendices a and b.",
    "for our analysis we will employ the standard model of a planar ballistic sns junction ( fig . [ sfnfs - fig ] ) with spin - active ns interfaces ( located at @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and cross - section area @xmath6 .",
    "outside an immediate vicinity of the interface regions quasiparticle wave functions can be represented as a sum of two rapidly oscillating exponents @xmath7 where @xmath8 is coordinate normal to the ns interfaces , @xmath9 represents the coordinates in the transversal directions and @xmath10 is the normal component of the fermi momentum . the wave functions @xmath11 vary smoothly at atomic distances . applying the standard andreev approximation it is easy to demonstrate that @xmath11 obeys the following equation @xmath12 \\psi_{\\pm}=0 , \\label{andreeveq}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the pauli matrix in the nambu space , @xmath14 are the pauli matrices in the spin space , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the bcs order parameter which is assumed to be spatially constant equal to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) in the first ( second ) superconducting electrode and is set equal to zero @xmath19 in the normal metal .",
    ". does not apply at the interfaces and should be supplemented by the proper boundary conditions which account for spin - sensitive electron scattering . in order to formulate these boundary conditions",
    "we will employ the general @xmath20-matrix formalism .",
    "for instance , matching of the quasiparticle wave functions at the first interface is performed with the aid of the following equation @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the quasiparticle wave function amplitudes respectively at superconducting and normal sides of the first interface .",

    "this matrix has the form    @xmath57    diagonal blocks of this matrix describes electron - electron and hole - hole amplitudes while off - diagonal blocks account for electron - hole conversion .",
    "one can directly verify that the matrix @xmath56 is unitary for subgap energies @xmath58 at which no excitations exist in the superconducting electrode i.    analogously from the matching conditions at the second interface ( @xmath5 ) we obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 is scattering matrix for the second interface at subgap energies @xmath61 and we introduced the following notations @xmath62 the matrix @xmath60 is defined by eq . with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "<S> we develop a general microscopic theory of dc josephson effect in hybrid sns structures with ballistic electrodes and spin - active ns interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we establish a direct relation between the spectrum of andreev levels and the josephson current which contains complete information about non - trivial interplay between andreev reflection and spin - dependent interface scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the system exhibits a rich structure of properties sensitive to spin - dependent barrier transmissions , spin - mixing angles , relative magnetization orientation of interfaces and the kinematic phase of scattered electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the current - phase relations and identify the conditions for the presence of a @xmath0-junction state in the systems under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze resonant enhancement of the supercurrent in gate - voltage - driven nanojunctions . </S>",
    "<S> as compared to the non - magnetic case , this effect can be strongly modified by spin - dependent scattering at ns interfaces . </S>"
