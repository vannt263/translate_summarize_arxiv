    "the internet is by far the world s most crucial technological artifact . a mere quarter century after its beginning",
    ", it has emerged to become , through connecting over two billion people , the nexus of all human activity  intellectual , social , economic  and to satisfy , to varying and rapidly evolving degrees , humanity s thirst for information and access , communication and interaction , education and wisdom , entertainment and excitement , opportunity and publicity , let alone justice , freedom , democracy .",
    "the internet is also a gestalt , complex system ; a novel , mysterious , and fascinating scientific object studied intensely by researchers of all colors , including computer scientists and economists .    from the point of view of economics ( that is to say , efficiency and scarcity ) one useful abstraction of the internet",
    "is that of a _ two - sided market _ @xcite .",
    "in such a market , a platform ( e.g. , a game console , or an operating system , or an internet service provider ( isp ) ) brings together two populations of agents : players with game developers , or users with application programmers , or , in the case of isps , internet users with internet content providers ( cps , such as google , nyt , or shtetl - optimized ) .",
    "two - sided markets are interesting because they can exhibit network effects and other complex externalities .",
    "an important question is , if the two populations are passive price - takers , what is the platform policy ( typically , pricing for access from both sides ) that maximizes platform revenue , and what is the socially optimum policy ? plus , if these two differ substantially , how should the two - sided market be optimally regulated ?    in the case of the internet , this question has been known as the _ net neutrality debate _ , see @xcite and the related work section for the complex history and diverse and precarious current status .",
    "the term  net neutrality \" has been used in many different senses .",
    "most fundamentally , and closest to home , net neutrality is the computer science argument that the _ end - to - end _ principle in networking @xcite implies that isps have no access to the content or origin of packets ( as such information adds nothing to the network s ability to operate properly ) . in policy , law , and economics , by  net neutrality \"",
    "one typically understands two implied consequences of the end - to - end principle , namely that isps cannot / should not ( a ) treat flows differentially depending on the originating cp ; or ( b ) charge cps for resource use , or for content delivery to consumers .",
    "there is a substantial and growing literature of economic research on net neutrality , and the two subtly different interpretations of the term  net neutrality \" ( a ) and ( b ) above give rise to divergent threads within it ( see the related work section ) . typically the models include only one isp ( even though interesting analyses of multiple isps exist @xcite ) who charges ( or does not ) the two sides of the market for access , while the utility of the two populations is modeled in a number of different natural ways",
    ". unsurprisingly , there is no definitive answer in the literature to the key question above (  which isp policy is socially optimal ? \" ) , even though interesting points can be made based on such models ( more in the related work section ) .",
    "[ [ the - model . ] ] the model .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we introduce and analyze a new model of two - sided market motivated by the net neutrality problem .",
    "our goals in defining this model have been these :    * _ keep the model very simple , _ with very few and crisp parameters and assumptions , so that general conclusions can be drawn .",
    "* at the same time , adopt assumptions ( e.g. about distributions ) compatible with the acknowledged reality of the internet .",
    "our model is the first to assume that the types of both users and cps are _ power - law distributed . _    power law distributions @xcite ( see also @xcite for their use in economic modeling ) are simple distributions outside the exponential family , with one parameter ( the exponent ) typically ranging between 2 and 3",
    " thus , they also serve our goal of parametric parsimony . even though they had been observed in many places since the early 20th century ( in city populations , word frequencies , incomes , etc . ) , it was the internet that brought them to the center of technical discourse  indeed it seems almost impossible to understand and model any aspect of the internet and the web without resorting to these types of distributions .",
    "it seems natural to suppose that cp type ( capturing the cp s quality , or market share , or size ) is so distributed , since power - law distributed firm size is a known characteristic of dynamic industries .",
    "it is also natural to accept that consumer types ( measuring motivation , interest in the internet ) are power - law distributed  for example , incomes are distributed this way .",
    "type distributions lie at the basis of our model .",
    "the product of consumer type @xmath0 times cp type @xmath1 , times the speed of the net , captures the _ matching probability _ , the probability that a consumer of type @xmath0 will `` like '' ( download content from ) a cp of type @xmath1 .",
    "this , together with a simple assumption on network speed ( we take it inversely proportional to total traffic ) defines the expected utility of both cps and consumers : for a cp we assume it is proportional to the number of consumers who like it ( modeling advertising income , or else popularity ) and for a consumer a concave function , such as the square root , of the number of cps that s / he likes .",
    "finally , in the appendix we also briefly discuss a simple model of quality - of - service differentiation where an isp charges cps for using a privileged channel akin to the so - called `` paris metro pricing '' @xcite .    naturally , there are many aspects of this complex problem that we do not model : we do not model isp costs , and , most importantly for the net neutrality debate , isp technology and investment",
    ". however , our work can inform this crucial aspect of the problem , as our analytical results depend explicitly on the total network capacity .",
    "our model of cp cost is simplistic ( we assume that it is , in expectation , proportional to its type ) , but we have obtained similar results under different assumptions .",
    "we assume that there is only one isp ( as does most of the literature ) ; however , our results can be used to solve simple models with many isps .",
    "and we do not model one of the salient characteristics of the internet , namely its rapid growth ; however , our use of power - law distributions in cp size can be seen as taking into account the exquisitely dynamic nature of the internet market .",
    "[ [ our - results . ] ] our results .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    _ we derive closed - form analytical results _ for almost all of the questions raised by our model : for the optimum isp policy , for the optimum isp policy under net neutrality , as well as for the isp policy that maximizes social welfare , but also for comparisons between them ; for a few points that are hard to answer analytically , we have very clean computational results .",
    "our most surprising conclusion is that , in this model , _ net neutrality is not socially optimal _ unless cp costs are very small .",
    "that is , there is in general a socially optimum price the isp should charge the cps , and this price is zero only if a parameter measuring cp costs ( essentially , the average inverse productivity in the cp industry ) is below a threshold .",
    "regulation is needed for efficiency , requiring the isp to charge cps not necessarily zero , as in net neutrality , but the socially optimum price , typically smaller than what the isp would like to charge .",
    "the question then , for the regime of large cp costs , becomes : among the two suboptimal extremes ( net neutrality or isp revenue maximization ) , which is the more efficient ?",
    "it turns out that the answer varies ( see the computational results in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] ) : for cp costs just above the neutrality threshold , net neutrality is better . for larger cp costs ,",
    "isp revenue maximization is better .",
    "interestingly , in both cases the differences in social welfare between the three regimes does not seem that great .",
    "overall , our model yields concrete , quantitative , and crisp results for the net neutrality problem , stemming from rather involved analysis , of the kind we believe had not been available in the literature , for a kind of model ( consumers and cps of power - law distributed types ) that is arguably especially fit for the problem in hand .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ tab : main ] .",
    "the parameters shown in this table will be mentioned in next section .",
    ".summary of results [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : main ]      for aspects of policy , law , and history of the subject see @xcite .",
    "@xcite is an eloquent advocacy of net neutrality backed by modest quantitative argument , while @xcite is an exploration of possible business models in the cp industry and the ways they affect the net neutrality issue ; the model involves only one cp . @xcite propose a sophisticated and realistic model of cp - consumer interaction , but the complexity of their model prevents definite conclusions about net neutrality ; an important monotonicity principle is shown , stating that social welfare is always coterminous with the total content transmitted through the network . in earlier work @xcite ,",
    "a simple model in a similar spirit to ours was proposed , albeit with cp and consumer types uniformly distributed .",
    "their results are dependent on parameter value ranges , with cp costs playing an important role , as they do in our results . in the model of @xcite",
    "there are many regional monopolist isps , and deviation from net neutrality leads in a tragedy in the commons situation ( the commons being the cp industry ) .",
    "the effect and nature of competition among isps is taken on in @xcite , through a mostly qualitative analysis .    net neutrality as differentiation in quality of service has also been addressed in the economic literature . in @xcite consumers",
    "are connected to _ two _ cps through a single isp running a network with realistic ( i.e. , informed by queueing theory ) delays , and two levels of service ( a fast lane sold through bidding in @xcite , a priority service in @xcite ) , and the two cps choose level of service according to their profitability .",
    "in contrast , @xcite models cps by their tolerance of network delays .",
    "finally , @xcite model the network as a sophisticated extensive - form game , in which cps , isps , and consumers interact by setting prices and choosing services ; they conclude that net neutrality prevails in several environments , for example in the presence of priority lanes .",
    "in our basic model an isp delivers the content of cps to a population of consumers :    * the consumers are modeled as a continuum of values for the _ consumer type _ @xmath2 , intuitively , a measure of the value this particular consumer receives from browsing the internet .",
    "importantly we assume that @xmath2 is power - law distributed , that is , the density function is @xmath3 for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the minimum type .",
    "we denote the expectation of @xmath2 by @xmath6 . * similarly , each cp has a type @xmath7 with density function @xmath8 for all @xmath9 , a measure of the cps quality , or size .",
    "again , @xmath10 . *",
    "bandwidth and speed : the isp provides bandwidth @xmath11 ( @xmath11 is taken to be one for simplicity , even though our results can be rewritten as functions also of @xmath11 , for the study of issues of investment and technology innovation by the isp ) .",
    "the speed of the network is then a decreasing function of the total traffic @xmath12 , denoted @xmath13 , specified next .",
    "* calculation of @xmath12 .",
    "crucially , we assume that the infinitesimal contribution to traffic by consumers of type and @xmath14 , etc . ]",
    "@xmath0 and cps of type @xmath1 , or equivalently , the intensity with which a consumer of type @xmath0 will like and download the content of a cp of type @xmath1 , is proportional to the product of the three magnitudes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath13 ( times @xmath15 , of course ) .",
    "therefore , the total traffic is @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the key parameters sought by our analysis , namely the minimum types of consumers and cps respectively that participate in the market ( do not drop out ) , given the charges imposed by the isp .",
    "the maximum traffic @xmath19 occurs when @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we use the relative speed function @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath23 + since @xmath12 only depends on @xmath24 , @xmath25 * utility functions . * * the utility of a user of type @xmath0 is assumed to be @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the expected number of content providers this user likes , @xmath28 is the membership fee imposed on users by the isp ( independent of the traffic ) , and @xmath29 is a concave function such as @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the utility function for a user of type @xmath0 is @xmath31 * * finally , we assume that the utility function of a content provider of type @xmath1 is @xmath32 where * * * @xmath33 is a needed `` exchange rate '' between the utility of consumers and that of cps ; * * * @xmath34 is the expected number of consumers who like this content provider  notice that we assume advertising income to be proportional to the number of users ; * * * @xmath35 is the expected costs of a content provider of type @xmath1 ; * * * @xmath36 is the payment that the content provider needs to pay to the platform .",
    "notice here a simplifying modeling maneuver : while we would like to make the cp s payment a linear function of the traffic originating from it , which is roughly @xmath34 , we make it instead a linear function of its quality @xmath1 , which is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "+ thus , the utility function of a content provider with quality @xmath1 is as follows : @xmath37 * revenue of the isp , from charges imposed on consumers and cps : @xmath38 * thus , the parameters of our model are these : power - law exponents @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; the consumer concave function @xmath41 ; and the cp utility parameters @xmath42 ( expected cost per unit of size ) and @xmath33 .",
    "the decision variables are @xmath43 and @xmath28 ( the prices charged ) .",
    "we calculate the optimum prices for the isp to charge the two sides of the market . for technical reasons",
    "we start by finding the optimum @xmath43 ( cp fee ) when @xmath44 ( this is theorem 1 ) , and then proceed to the general case ( theorem 2 ) .",
    "the proofs are in the appendix [ appendix : a ] .",
    "[ thm : c=0,a>0 ] if @xmath44 , the optimal pricing strategy is @xmath45    [ thm : c>0 , a>0 ] if @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a positive increasing concave function , the optimal pricing strategy is    * if @xmath48 , @xmath49 * if @xmath50 , + @xmath51 + where @xmath52 is the solution of @xmath18 which satisfies the following equation : @xmath53",
    "while excluding consumers is obviously inefficient , rather surprisingly including all cps may not be socially optimal .",
    "the intuitive reason is that low quality cps clutter the internet and incur large costs without adding enough value .",
    "again we must determine the optimal @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the corresponding @xmath43 and @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath54 denote the social welfare .",
    "we have :    @xmath55    where @xmath56    and @xmath57    plugging these two equation above into eq .",

    "is based on the fact that @xmath68 is a decreasing function of @xmath17 .",
    "the second inequality is because @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the optimal @xmath17 is @xmath70 .",
    "next , we consider @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath71    based on the same discussion in the proof of theorem [ thm : c>0 , a>0 ] , @xmath72    is an increasing function of @xmath18 .",
    "thus ,    * if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 . thus the optimal @xmath18 is @xmath75 .",
    "+ in this case , the optimal pricing strategy is @xmath76 * if @xmath77 , then there exists a unique solution @xmath60 for @xmath78 . then the socially optimal pricing is + @xmath65      we would like to know the relationship between the socially optimum cut off point for cps @xmath60 and its revenue maximizing counterpart @xmath52 .",
    "this relationship depends on @xmath79 and @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath41 belongs to a natural class of concave functions  namely , fractional powers  such comparison is possible : revenue maximization demands that more cps be cut off than does efficiency , assuming cp costs are not very low .",
    "let us define two important constants @xmath80    @xmath81    [ thm : comparison ] suppose @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84",
    ". then @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath52 ,    @xmath86    for @xmath60 ,    @xmath87    suppose @xmath88 , then    @xmath89    let @xmath90 , then    @xmath91    thus , if @xmath92 , @xmath93 . since @xmath94 and @xmath95 are both increasing functions , then @xmath85 if @xmath96 .      to summarize our results so far :    * in both revenue and welfare maximization ,",
    "no consumers are left outside the market .",
    "* when cp costs are small ( @xmath97 ) , then no cps are cut off either .",
    "* when @xmath98 , then no cps are cut off for social optimality , however , some cps will be cut off for revenue optimality .",
    "when @xmath41 is a fractional power function . ]",
    "* but otherwise , some cps must be cut off for efficiency ( that is , network neutrality is socially suboptimal ) , while more will have to be cut off for revenue optimality .",
    "but the question now arises , how does the social welfare of net neutrality compare with that of revenue optimality ?",
    "simulations show that the answer depends on cp costs , that is to say , @xmath42 . in the simulation @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "[ fig : sw ] shows the social welfare curve for three different values of @xmath42 : @xmath102 .",
    "when @xmath103 ( that is , close to the neutrality region ) net neutrality has better social welfare than revenue , while when @xmath104 the social welfare in revenue optimum case is quite a bit larger than the social welfare in net neutrality .",
    "in fact , we can show that there is a single transition in this regard ( proof in the appendix b ) :    if @xmath105 , there exists a unique @xmath106 such that when @xmath107 net neutrality has better welfare than revenue maximization , while the opposite happens when @xmath108 .",
    "we have presented a parsimonious model of the internet as a two - sided market with power - law distributed types from the two sides , with a simple cost structure for cps , and utilities for the two sides based on simple and natural assumptions .",
    "* net neutrality is socially optimum only when cp productivity is very high . for lower levels of cp productivity ( larger @xmath42 ) , net neutrality is better than isp revenue maximization , but net neutrality is worse than isp revenue maximization for even lower values .",
    "the preeminence of cp productivity as the determining factor of the optimum regulatory regime is one interesting insight from our model .",
    "there are many possible extensions that seem very interesting , and some of them appear to be within reach .    1 .   here we have adopted the `` no payment '' interpretation of net neutrality .",
    "what about the `` non - differentiation '' point of view ?",
    "we have interesting preliminary results of this sort ( see the appendix c ) .",
    "assume that part of the bandwidth is set aside for paying cps .",
    "the point is that the payment counter - incentive will increase speed in this `` channel '' ( this is the _",
    "paris metro pricing _ idea @xcite ) . how large part of the total bandwidth should be so allocated , and how should it be priced ? in the appendix we answer these questions , analytically and in more detail computationally , for the case @xmath109  that is , zero costs for cps .",
    "the general @xmath42 case seems harder , but it would be interesting to crack it .",
    "2 .   how could we make our model more realistic , without sacrificing much of its simplicity ?",
    "we have tried other forms of cp costs and charges ( for example , constant instead of linear in @xmath1 ) without seeing qualitatively different results . but how about changing the utility model ?",
    "one alternative model would weigh cp revenue by the type of the users it attracts .",
    "another would use more elaborate and realistic speed functions , for example from queueing theory .",
    "we have not considered _ subsidies _ of cps by the isp ( negative @xmath43 ; note that subsidies are common in two - way markets ) .",
    "would they ever improve social welfare , or even isp revenue ?",
    "a common argument against net neutrality is that it does not incentivize isps to invest in network technology .",
    "what can our model tell us about this ?",
    "in our calculations we have used , for simplicity that the bandwidth @xmath11 is one .",
    "we suspect that re - introducing @xmath11 into our formulas might reveal interesting insights about incentives of the isp to invest .",
    "5 .   we have assumed a monopolist isp ; how would isp competition affect the market ?",
    "we suspect that many isps competing for consumers under revenue maximization would result in @xmath44 , and would charge cps in near - identical ways , because each of them will be  selling \" to the cps a different lot ( in expectation of the same size ) of the same product : the consumers who ( randomly ) chose this isp .",
    "hence we suspect that our results summarized in theorem 1 come close to obtaining yet another interesting comparison point , telling us how the isp s monopoly is affecting the efficiency of the market .",

    "_    from eq [ eq : optimal_renvenue ] it is easy to check that @xmath42 is an increasing function of @xmath52 since @xmath140 is also an increasing function of @xmath52 .",
    "now , in revenue optimization , the social welfare @xmath54 is a function of @xmath52 , that is , @xmath151    following the same computation as eq [ eq : social_welfare_partial_y ] , we have    @xmath152    based on the discussion in theorem [ thm : comparison ] , @xmath153 .",
