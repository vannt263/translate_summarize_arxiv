    "there are several sources of `` galactic foreground '' emission at microwave frequencies : relativistic electrons ( synchrotron emission ) , thermal electrons ( free - free emission ) , and dust grains .",
    "microwave emission from dust grains was discovered by studies of the cmbr , which revealed a surprisingly strong component of the microwave sky brightness which was correlated with interstellar matter , as traced by 100@xmath0 m thermal dust emission . because this dust - correlated signal was much stronger than expected from existing models of interstellar dust",

    "; kogut 1999 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the `` anomalous '' microwave emission is not consistent with synchrotron emission , and maps at 408 mhz ( haslam 1981 ) and 1.42 ghz ( reich & reich 1988 ) do not correlate with the observed 15 - 100 ghz intensity ( kogut _ et al . _  1996a , b ; leitch _ et al . _",
    "1997 ; de oliveira - costa _ et al . _  1997 , 1998 ) , so the anomalous emission is evidently not synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons . in section [ sec : free - free ] we conclude that the observed emission significantly exceeds the free - free emission from interstellar plasma . the excess emission must be due to dust",
    ".    there are three quite distinct mechanisms whereby dust can radiate at microwave frequencies ; they can be classified as ( 1 ) `` vibrational electric dipole '' emision ( due to thermal fluctuations in the charge distribution in the grain ) ; ( 2 ) `` magnetic dipole '' emission ( due to thermal fluctuations in the magnetization of grain material ) ; and ( 3 ) `` rotational electric dipole '' emission ( due to the rotating electric dipole moment of a spinning grain ) .",
    "most of the power radiated by interstellar dust is due to `` vibrational electric dipole '' emission , peaking in the far - infrared at @xmath1100@xmath0 m .",
    "the low - frequency `` tail '' of this emission can be extrapolated to microwave frequencies , but falls far below the observed 1060 ghz emission . however , as discussed in ",

    "figure [ fig : obs ] shows the observed emission spectrum of diffuse interstellar dust , based on measurements by the _ infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ) _ , the _ firas _ spectrometer and the _ dirbe _ photometers on the _ cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) _ , and the _ mid - ir spectrometer ( mirs ) _ and the _ near - ir spectrometer ( nirs ) _ on the _ infrared telescope in space ( irts)_.      the emission from interstellar matter between 1  mm ( 300 ghz ) and @xmath2 m ( 3000 ghz ) is due primarily to thermal emission from dust particles heated by diffuse starlight to temperatures @xmath3k , as was expected theoretically ( see , e.g. , draine & lee 1984 ) .    while the observed spectrum between 1  mm and 100@xmath0 m can be accurately described by multicomponent fits ( wright _ et al . _  1991",

    "away from molecular regions , the 100@xmath0 m emission correlates very well with 21 cm emission ( boulanger & prault 1988 ) , allowing us to infer the average emissivity per h nucleon ( draine 1999 ) : @xmath8 { \\rm erg~s^{-1 } sr^{-1 } h^{-1}}\\ ] ] where a good fit is obtained for @xmath9k and @xmath10 .",
    "this choice of @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponds to an absorption cross section per h nucleon @xmath13 figure [ fig : obs ] shows this and other single - temperature fits together with observational determinations of the dust emission spectrum .",
    "a striking feature of figure [ fig : obs ] is the strong emission at @xmath14 m observed by _ iras _ , _ cobe - dirbe _ , and _ irts_. this emission , accounting for @xmath135% of the total power radiated by dust , is far in excess of what would be expected from dust grains at @xmath15k .",
    "the only natural explanation for this is to attribute it to dust grains which are so small that absorption of a single starlight photon heats them to temperatures high enough for thermal emission to produce the observed radiation ( draine & anderson 1985 ) .",
    "grain temperatures as high as @xmath16k are required to account for the emission observed in the 12@xmath0 m band , so the grains must be _ very _ small : if the specific heat is characterized by a debye temperature @xmath17k ( the value for graphite ; furukawa _ et al . _  1972",

    "even smaller particles are required by the strong emission observed at shorter wavelengths ( see figure [ fig : obs ] ) .",

    "the procedure used here will tend to _ overestimate _ the emissivity @xmath28 when the observations include regions ( e.g. , non - star - forming molecular clouds ) where the dust is somewhat cooler than in diffuse hi clouds .",
    "the cooler dust will have a lower fir emissivity , and hence @xmath29 will actually be larger than deduced from @xmath30 using eq.([eq : betafit ] ) .",

    "the observed dust - correlated microwave emissivities at @xmath31 ghz tend to be well above the extrapolation to low frequencies with the `` best fit '' @xmath20 . for this reason",
    "the dust - correlated microwave emission has been referred to as `` anomalous '' ( leitch _ et al .",

    "et al . _  ( 1996a ) suggested that the observed 3050 ghz excess was due to free - free emission from ionized gas which was correlated with dust .",
    "however , leitch _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) measured the dust - correlated 14.5 and 32 ghz emission from 36 fields around the north celestial pole , and showed that for these fields the `` anomalous emission '' could not be free - free emission from gas at @xmath32k , as the recombination radiation which must accompany free - free emission is not present on h@xmath33 maps ( gaustad _ et al . _",

    "observing programs now underway will soon provide a much better knowledge of the h@xmath33 sky , but existing studies of the correlation between h@xmath33 emission and dust 100@xmath0 m emission ( mccullough 1997 ; kogut 1997 ) over limited regions find a dust - correlated h@xmath33 component with @xmath35 this correlation is found when averaging on angular scales of a few degrees ( mccullough _ et al . _",
    "the dust - correlated h@xmath33 presumably originates mainly from photoionized cloud rims , but approximately 25% of the high latitude h@xmath33 is estimated to be scattered light ( jura 1979 ; mccullough 1997 ) .",

    "figure [ fig : microwave_obs ] shows that the observed dust - correlated 1060 ghz emission is systematically well above the level expected for free - free emission from @xmath110@xmath38k gas .",
    "an additional source of emission is required.10@xmath38k gas , but we feel that the evidence for an additional source of dust - correlated microwave emission  as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : microwave_obs ]  is very strong .",

    "hot gas can not explain the emission observed over large fields by kogut _",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) and de oliveira - costa _ et al . _  ( 1997 , 1998 ) , since the resulting x - ray power would exceed the estimated rate of energy input from supernovae by a factor @xmath110@xmath39 ( draine & lazarian 1998a , hereafter dl98a ) .",
    "since synchrotron radiation has been ruled out , dust appears to be the only possible source of the excess emission .",
    "since the predicted `` vibrational electric dipole '' emission has been seen above to be insufficient , one or more additional dust emission mechanisms must be important at microwave frequencies .",
    "magnetic dipole emission is marginal at optical and infrared frequencies ( @xmath40  hz ) but gets quite appreciable as the frequency of oscillating magnetic field approaches the precession frequency of an electron spin in the magnetic field of its neighbors , which is @xmath41  hz . the magneto - dipole microwave emissivity is enhanced if the grain material is strongly magnetic , e.g. ferro- or ferrimagnetic .",
    "iron is the fifth most abundant element by mass ( after h , he , o , and c ) , and it is well known from absorption line studies that interstellar gas - phase fe is heavily `` depleted '' , with most of the fe locked up in dust grains ( see the review by savage & sembach 1996 ) . if @xmath130% of the grain mass is carbonaceous , fe and ni contribute @xmath42% of the mass of the remaining grain material .",
    "the chemical form in which the solid - phase fe resides is not yet known , but some fraction might be in strongly magnetic materials , such as metallic fe or magnetite ( fe@xmath43o@xmath44 ) .",
    "draine & lazarian ( 1999 , hereafter dl99 ) discuss emission and absorption of radiation by grains containing magnetic materials , and show that magnetic dipole emission due to thermal fluctuations in the magnetization can dominate the thermal emission at microwave frequencies .",
    "`` ordinary '' paramagnetism will result in more emission at @xmath45ghz than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : betafit ] ) , but still far less than observed . in order for magnetic dipole emission to reach intensities comparable to those observed ,",
    "it is necessary for a substantial fraction of interstellar fe to be in ferromagnetic ( e.g. , metallic fe ) or ferrimagnetic ( e.g. , magnetite fe@xmath43o@xmath44 ) materials .",
    "figure [ fig : magdipole ] shows that if 100% of the fe is in magnetite , the magnetic dipole emission would approach that observed ; if as little as 5% of the fe is in pure metallic form  either as bare single - domain particles , or single - domain inclusions within larger paramagnetic grains ) , the magnetic dipole emission will peak at @xmath190ghz , as the result of a magnetic dipole `` frhlich resonance '' ( dl99 ) .",
    "existing observations show no evidence for such an emission feature , so dl99 conclude that not more than @xmath15% of the interstellar fe can be in ( pure ) metallic iron",
    ".    on the other hand , the fe could be in some impure metallic form which is more strongly magnetic than magnetite , but less magnetic than pure fe metal .",
    "if we allow ourselves the freedom to `` tune '' the frequency - dependent magnetic susceptibility , dl99 show that there are parameter combinations which come close to reproducing the observed emission ; an example of such a `` designer '' material is shown in figure [ fig : designer ] . the magneto - dipole contribution to the `` anomalous '' emission",
    "can be established via observations ( see  [ sec : tests ] ) .",
    "the possibility of rotational emission from dust grains was apparently first discussed by erickson ( 1957 ) . however , as the rotational emission is proportional to the fourth power of the angular velocity , only extremely small grains rotate sufficiently rapidly to produce appreciable emission . as the evidence for such grains did not exist at the time , the idea was not pursued .",
    "more recently , after the discovery of the population of ultrasmall grains , ferrara & dettmar ( 1994 ) noted that the rotational emission from these grains could be observable , and dl98a proposed that the observed `` anomalous '' emission was just the expected rotational emission from the population of ultrasmall grains .",
    "the rotational dynamics of dust grains , and resulting rotational emission , are discussed by draine & lazarian ( 1998b ; herafter dl98b ) . to predict expected levels of microwave emissivity dl98b had to estimate the distribution of ultrasmall grains , their rates of rotation and their dipole moment .",
    "an important finding of dl98b is that for reasonable parameter values the rotational radiation from ultrasmall grains can account for the observed anomalous emission .    for a population of small grains containing 5% of the cosmic carbon abundance ( with 3% of the cosmic carbon abundance in grains with radii @xmath46 , or @xmath47 c atoms ) , the predicted microwave emissivity of dust in hi clouds ( @xmath48 , @xmath49k )",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : spinning ] .",
    "we see that this rotational emission appears to be quite capable of explaining the observed @xmath50ghz `` anomalous '' emission .    a number of different processes ( including collisions with ions , collisions with neutrals , `` plasma drag '' , emission of infrared photons , and electric dipole radiation ) play a role in the excitation and damping of grain rotation .",
    "quite unexpectedly , dl98b found that collisions with ions and plasma interactions are extremely important for the dynamics of ultrasmall grains even in mostly neutral media . because the interstellar medium is far from thermodynamic equilibrium , the mean rotational kinetic energy can be larger or smaller than the @xmath51 which would apply if the system were in lte .",
    "for example , @xmath52  grains in hi clouds are estimated to have an rms rotation rate of 20 ghz , corresponding to a mean rotational kinetic energy of only @xmath53 ( dl98b ) .",
    "the subthermal rotation is the result of the strong damping due to electric dipole radiation . for ultrasmall grains quantum effects",
    "become important .",
    "dl98b found that they limit the `` rotational drag '' on ultrasmall grains due to the plasma .",
    "the spectrum shown in figure [ fig : spinning ] is only approximate .",
    "dl98a , b considered a number of models corresponding to various different assumptions regarding electric dipole moments , grain geometry , and numbers of small grains .",
    "the resulting emissivities vary by a factor of several .",
    "figure [ fig : spinning ] corresponds to the most likely choice of the parameters .",
    "the calculations in dl98b assumed a maxwellian form for the distribution of rotational velocities .",
    "for very small grains , the actual distribution of rotational velocities is expected to be highly non - maxwellian , particularly because the rotational excitation is dominated by collisions with ions , which deliver angular impulses which can be large compared to the rms angular momentum of the grain ( dl98b ) .",
    "a more detailed study of the rotational distribution function for ultrasmall grains , and the resulting rotational emission spectrum , is in progress ( draine & li 1999 ) .",
    "for microwave background experiments it is important to measure the signal as a function of the angular scale .",
    "variations of microwave emission from dust on scales of a few degrees will interfere with measurements of the cosmic background radiation on these scales .",
    "the spatial structure of the 100@xmath0 m cirrus has been studied by gautier _",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) , and herbstmeier _ et al . _  ( 1998 ) . for measurements made with a telescope beam of angular resolution @xmath54 ,",
    "the rms variations in beam - averaged surface brightness are empirically given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the 100@xmath0 m surface brightness in that region of the sky .",
    "for the `` north polar cloud '' near the north celestial pole studied by gautier _",
    "_ , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : space ] illustrates the relative importance of the emission from dust for intermediate galactic latitudes , with @xmath59 .",
    "the rms variations of dust column density are taken to be @xmath60% on @xmath11@xmath61 scales , of the order expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluct ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations in the h@xmath33 emission on @xmath11@xmath61 scales are taken to be 1 rayleigh , and the accompanying free - free emission is shown for @xmath62k .",
    "the synchrotron background is smoother than dust and the corresponding fluctuations are taken to be 5% on the same angular scale . from the standpoint of minimizing confusion with non - cbr foregrounds , 60 - 120  ghz appears to be the optimal frequency window .",
    "substantial variations of microwave emissivity are expected when the line of sight crosses particular regions .",
    "calculations in dl98b were done for emission from spinning dust grains in from dark clouds , reflection nebulae , photo - dissociation regions etc .",
    "these variations can be used to test the spinning dust model .",
    "polarization of cosmic microwave background can provide valuable insight to the physics of early universe ( zaldarriaga 1997 , seljak & zaldarriaga 1997 ) and therefore is the subject of intensive theoretical studies ( see kamionkowski & kosowsky 1998 ) . to study polarization of cosmological origin one has to separate it from foreground polarization caused by dust .",
    "the far - infrared and sub - mm thermal `` electric dipole vibrational '' emission is expected to be linearly polarized with electric vector @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the local interstellar magnetic field .",
    "the degree of polarization depends on the degree of alignment of the @xmath65 m grains which dominate both the far - infrared thermal emission and the polarization of starlight .",
    "polarizations of @xmath66 are expected ( prunet _ et al . _  1997 ) at frequencies ( @xmath67ghz ) where the `` electric dipole vibrational '' emission dominates ( see more in prunet & lazarian 1999 ) .      at frequencies",
    "@xmath68 ghz , however , we expect the spinning grains to dominate the emission",
    ". for perfectly aligned rotating grains the degree of polarization would approach 100% . such polarized emission could completely mask the polarization of cosmological origin .    finding the actual decree of alignment for ultrasmall grains is a challenging theoretical problem .",
    "the existing theories of alignment ( see list of the processes in lazarian , goodman & myers 1997 ) deal with @xmath65 m grains , while processes that can align ultrasmall grains have not been studied until very recently .",
    "lazarian & draine ( 1997 , 1999 , henceforth ld99 ) concluded that paramagnetic dissipation is the most promissing process that can align ultrasmall grains over substantial ism regions .",
    "paramagnetic dissipation is the most natural mechanism to consider as even ultrasmall grains almost certainly contain atoms and ions with unpaired electrons , and they will be rotating in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the effect of the galactic magnetic field @xmath64 is to damp the component of angular momentum perpendicular to the field , thereby bringing about partial alignment of the angular momentum @xmath69 with @xmath70 . as a result",
    ", the electric dipole radiation from the spinning grains will be partially linearly polarized with the electric vector @xmath63 .",
    "ld99 claim that paramagnetic relaxation for rapidly rotating grains is more efficient than davis - greenstein ( 1951 ) theory predicts .",
    "the latter implicitly assumes that the relaxation does not depend on whether the grain rotates in stationary magnetic field or the magnetic field rotates around a stationary grain .",
    "however , a rotating grain gets magnetized via the barnett effect ( landau & lifshitz , 1960 ) as the grain rotation effectively removes the degeneracy between `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' states .",
    "this splitting of energy levels also implies that energy dissipation will not be suppressed by very rapid rotation rates since , in effect , the grain rotation frequency is always resonant with the splitting of energy levels .",
    "ld99 term this effect `` resonance relaxation '' .",
    "work to estimate the frequency - dependent polarization expected for the galactic foreground is in progress but estimates of polarization of the order a few percent were obtained in ld99 for frequencies less than 30  ghz . for frequencies higher than 40  ghz",
    "the polarization becomes negligible as the result of efficient radiative damping .",
    "we note that the degree of grain alignment depends on the ratio of the rotational damping time to the paramagnetic dissipation time .",
    "the rapid increase of rotational damping with frequency causes the decrease of alignment of the most rapidly rotating grains .      if magnetic dipole emission    from single - domain ferromagnetic grains is present , it will add a distinct , frequency - dependent , polarization signature , with polarization of the magnetic dipole radiation changing sign close to the frequency where the intensity of the magnetic dipole radiation peaks ( dl99 )",
    ".    even if emission from rotating grains dominates the overall emission , the polarized emission from single - domain ferro- and ferrimagnetic grains could be very important .",
    "constraining the abundance of such grains via observations is a problem for future research .",
    "both the magnetic dipole mechanism and the spinning grain mechanism predict that that emissivity @xmath24 should show a sharp decrease as the frequency falls below @xmath71ghz ; future low - frequency cmbr studies should be able to test this prediction .",
    "the spectra predicted for magnetic grain materials ( figures [ fig : magdipole ] and [ fig : designer ] ) differ from the spectrum predicted for spinning grains in figure [ fig : spinning ] , but it must be remembered that these spectra depend on uncertain assumptions : magnetic susceptibilities are required to estimate magnetic dipole radiation ; size distributions and electric dipole moments are required to estimate the emission due to spinning grains .",
    "the emission spectra in figures [ fig : magdipole ]  [ fig : spinning ] are therefore not expected to be accurate in detail .    as pointed out by dl99 , one way to distinguish between the spinning grain mechanism and magnetic dipole emission",
    "would be to measure the microwave emission from dust in a dense globule .",
    "studies of wavelength - dependent extinction ( see the review by mathis 1990 ) indicate that small grains are underabundant in dense regions , so the rotational emission per h should be lower in dense clouds .",
    "the magnetic dipole emission , on the other hand , is proportional to the total grain volume , but insensitive to the particle size .",
    "hence the coagulation which presumably acts to reduce the population of ultrasmall grains in dark , dense regions will not affect the magnetic dipole emission .",
    "measurement of the microwave emission spectrum from a dark globule can therefore reveal whether the anomalous emission is due to spinning grains or magnetic grains .",
    "the principal points discussed above are as follows :    * there is strong evidence for 1060 ghz emission correlated with interstellar gas beyond that due to free - free emission . * the strong emission from interstellar dust at @xmath14 m ( see figure [ fig : obs ] ) requires a large population of ultrasmall dust grains .",
    "* these ultrasmall dust grains will rotate rapidly , and will radiate electric dipole radiation at microwave frequencies ( see figure [ fig : spinning ] ) which could explain the observed `` anomalous '' emission . *",
    "the preferred range of cosmic microwave background observations is from 60 to 120  ghz . *",
    "the small grains will be partially aligned , with their angular momenta tending to be either parallel or antiparallel to the local interstellar magnetic field @xmath70 ( lazarian & draine 1997 ) . the electric dipole emission will therefore tend to be polarized with @xmath72 .",
    "* polarization from rotating grains is expected to be negligible for frequencies larger than 40  ghz . *",
    "if grains consist in part of magnetic material , such as metallic fe or magnetite fe@xmath43o@xmath44 , the thermal fluctuations in the magnetization will result in strong magnetic dipole emission .",
    "if most of the interstellar fe resides in a magnetic material such as magnetite , a substantial fraction of the observed `` anomalous '' emission could be thermal radiation from such magnetic materials . *",
    "if single - domain ferromagnetic grains are present and aligned , the magnetic dipole radiation from them will have an unusual polarization signature .",
    "* measurement of the emission from dark globules may allow us to decide between spinning grains and magnetic dipole emission as the dominant contribution to the anomalous emission .",

    "<S> observations of the cosmic microwave background have revealed a component of 1060  ghz emission from the galaxy which correlates with 100140@xmath0 m emission from interstellar dust but has an intensity much greater than expected for the low - frequency tail of the `` electric dipole vibrational '' emission peaking at @xmath1130@xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> this `` anomalous emission '' is more than can be accounted for by dust - correlated free - free emission . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous emission could be due in part to magnetic dipole emission from thermal fluctuations of the magnetization within interstellar dust grains , but only if a substantial fraction of the fe in interstellar dust resides in magnetic materials such as metallic iron or magnetite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed anomalous emission is probably due primarily to electric dipole radiation from spinning ultrasmall interstellar dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> this rotational emission is expected to be partially polarized . </S>"
