    "in recent years the inner structure of dark matter haloes has been the topic of some discussion .",
    "observations suggest that the dark matter distribution in disk galaxies has a roughly constant density core , with a typical size of order a few kpc .",
    "a recent analysis suggests a shallow power - law mass density distribution @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations based on the ( @xmath0)cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm suggest a very steep inner mass density distribution , a so - called `` cusp '' @xcite [ nfw ] .",
    "the most recent simulations suggest slopes with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "there is strong consensus that this slope can not be as shallow as the observations suggest .",
    "the rotation curves of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are considered particularly clean tests of the cdm paradigm at galaxy scales .",
    "lsb galaxies are dominated by dark matter @xcite , and their dynamics should thus give a more or less direct map of the dark matter distribution .",
    "lsb galaxy rotation curves , together with the missing dwarf or substructure problem ( e.g.  @xcite ) , currently form the most serious challenges for the cdm model . there has been much debate on this topic in recent years .",
    "this is however not the place to review this debate , and the reader is referred to the summaries by e.g.  @xcite and @xcite and references therein .    on the theoretical side the `` universal mass density profile '' ( with its characteristic @xmath4 cusp ) as proposed by @xcite ,",
    "has long been a corner - stone of cdm ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "recent simulations presented in @xcite and @xcite [ hereafter h04 ] show that simulated cdm haloes may actually contain a range of slopes in their inner regions ( though the slopes remain steep ) . the shallowest inner slope measured is @xmath5 , with an average over the simulated haloes of @xmath6 ( at the innermost reliably resolved radius for galaxy mass haloes ) . with this scatter in mind , h04 argue that simple fitting functions ( such as `` the '' nfw halo ) do not capture the full variety and diversity in shapes and slopes , and suggest that this may partly explain the discrepancy between observations and simulations .",
    "they claim that the inner slope is difficult to constrain , both observationally as well as theoretically and point out that rotation curve constraints are strongest where numerical simulations are least reliable .",
    "this , as well as the potential for systematic effects in the observations , has , at least according to h04 , led to an `` unwarranted emphasis '' on the value of the inner slope , at the cost of evaluation of the data and simulations over their full radial extent .",
    "h04 present a novel method to fit rotation curves derived from their simulations as well as lsb galaxy rotation curves from the literature .",
    "their method is able to describe the variety present in data and simulations and from the distributions of respective fitting parameters h04 conclude that the observed curves _ are _ consistent with the cdm paradigm ; a conclusion that contradicts a large body of observational work .    for their analysis ,",
    "h04 make use of the rotation curves presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and derive circular velocity curves for haloes from their simulations .",
    "to quantify both sets of observed and simulated rotation curves they use a three - parameter fitting formula ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    @xmath7    here @xmath8 is the asymptotic velocity of the flat part of the rotation curve , @xmath9 is a scale radius ( the transition radius between the rising and flat part of the rotation curve ) and the parameter @xmath10 describes the abruptness of the turn - over between the rising and flat parts of the rotation curve . a higher value of @xmath10 results in an abrupt transition , a low value in a more gradual turn - over .",
    "note that this function was designed to fit observed rotation curves : it specifically assumes a solid - body rise in the inner parts and a flat rotation curve in the outer parts .",
    "h04 fit the two sets of rotation curves with this function , constraining the fit parameters slightly by insisting that    1 .",
    "@xmath11 , 2 .",
    "@xmath12 , 3 .",
    "@xmath13 ,    with @xmath14 the maximum observed velocity in the rotation curve . fits with @xmath15 [ rejected by condition ( 1 ) ] correspond with very abrupt transitions between the rising and flat parts of the curve .",
    "condition ( 3 ) prevents some of the solid - body rotation curves where the asymptotic velocity is not well - constrained , from producing fits with extremely large @xmath8 .",
    "conditions ( 1)(3 ) thus help removing unrealistic values for the fit parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : hayashidata ] ( after h04 , their fig .",
    "9 ) shows the results presented in h04 .",
    "the lsb rotation curves show a broad distribution in @xmath10 with two pronounced peaks : one around @xmath16 and a narrower one at @xmath17 .",
    "some 70 per cent of the fits have @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath10 distribution of the simulated cdm haloes is markedly different .",
    "it is narrow and centered around @xmath19 with a dispersion of @xmath20 .    at first sight",
    "the two distributions seem quite incompatible , and one might conclude that the lsb rotation curves are not consistent with the cdm simulations .",
    "h04 argue however that for most of the lsb galaxy rotation curves the reduced @xmath21 distribution is quite broad and shallow , so that by constraining the fit parameters slightly more , a fit can be found that is consistent with the simulations , at the cost of only a small increase in @xmath22 .",
    "they define these cdm - compatible constraints as :    1 .",
    "@xmath23 2 .",
    "@xmath12 3 .",
    "@xmath13 4 .",
    "@xmath24 .",
    "here @xmath25 is the average density within the radius where the velocity reaches half its maximum value ( alam et al 2002 ) .",
    "see h04 for a justification of these additional constraints , here it is sufficient to note that for the lsb galaxies @xmath25 is derived from the fit of eq .",
    "( 1 ) to the rotation curves , whereas @xmath26 is the predicted value for a galaxy with @xmath27 in the @xmath0cdm model presented in @xcite and @xcite ( see also fig .  2 in @xcite and fig .",
    "11 in h04 ) .",
    "the constraint on @xmath25 ensures that only fits are considered with average densities close to those predicted in a standard @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "h04 find that for the majority ( @xmath28 70 per cent ) of the galaxies fits can be found for which both the best - fit @xmath29 [ using constraints ( 1)-(3 ) ] and the constrained @xmath30 [ using constraints ( i)-(iii ) ] .",
    "this group of galaxies ( group a using the terminology in h04 ) is thus considered to be consistent with cdm . for the remaining galaxies no cdm - compatible fit could be found ( group b in h04 ) , or the curves were too irregular to be well fitted by eq .  ( 1 ) ( group c in h04 ) .",
    "the main claim in h04 is thus that most of the lsb galaxies can still be fitted reasonably well with these extra constraints and without a large increase in @xmath22 .",
    "they conclude , based on the agreements of the constrained , cdm - compatible @xmath10 and @xmath25 distributions with those of the simulations , that `` this sample of lsb rotation curves is not manifestly inconsistent with the predictions of @xmath0cdm cosmological models . ''",
    "this conclusion thus contradicts most observational work on lsb rotation curves which argues the opposite .    in this paper",
    "i discuss these conclusions and investigate the method with which they are derived .",
    "i find that the method presented in h04 can not distinguish between shallow and steep mass - density slopes , and illustrate this by showing that with this method even core - dominated , pseudo - isothermal halos would be inferred to be consistent with cdm .",
    "i introduce an additional criterion that does take the inner mass - density slope into account , and find that only a quarter of the lsb galaxies investigated are possibly consistent with cdm .",
    "however , most of these galaxies fit parameters are so weakly constrained that this is not a very strong conclusion .",
    "only 3 out of the 51 galaxies investigated have tightly constrained solutions that are not significantly inconsistent with cdm . however , two of them are high surface brightness galaxies that are likely dominated by their stellar population .",
    "the net result is that in the total sample there is only one galaxy that is likely to be dark matter dominated and not significantly inconsistent with cdm .",
    "lsb galaxies that are consistent with cdm seem to be rare indeed .    in sect .",

    "4 i show that the constraints imposed by h04 are not sufficient to prove or disprove agreement with cdm . in sect .  5 a new constraint",
    "is introduced that does take the slope into account .",
    "the results are summarised in sect .",
    "equation  ( 1 ) is a flexible , analytical function that can describe a wide range of rotation curves ( see @xcite for more examples ) .",
    "one can , analogous to h04 , use the fitting function to investigate the properties of the underlying data . assuming a spherical halo dominated by dark matter we can use the inversion used in e.g.  @xcite to derive the corresponding mass - density distribution :    @xmath31    in combination with eq .",

    "( 3 ) :    @xmath33    the logarithmic , or power - law slope @xmath34 thus _ depends on both @xmath10 and @xmath9_. fig .",
    "[ fig : courslope ] shows @xmath34 for a number of values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 , where the values have been chosen to cover the range shown by the lsb rotation curve fits from h04 . changing @xmath10 has the effect of changing the shape of the slope - radius relations ; changing @xmath9 shifts the relations horizontally without affecting the shape for any particular @xmath10 .",
    "most of the plotted slopes are remarkably _ shallow _ at small radii .",
    "an inner asymptotic value of @xmath35 is predominant .",
    "the cdm slope @xmath5 can only be reproduced with eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) for small values of @xmath9 and/or extremely small values of @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , at large radii the slope converges to @xmath36 .",
    "these are not naturally occurring values for @xmath0cdm mass profiles , with asymptotic slopes @xmath37 in the inner parts and @xmath38 in the outer parts .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is really built to mimic the same striking features of rotation curves that led to the introduction of the pseudo - isothermal ( iso ) halo , namely a solid - body rise in the inner parts , and a constant ( `` flat '' ) rotation velocity in the outer parts .",
    "one needs to make very specific choices of fitting parameters to make this function resemble an nfw profile .",
    "the h04 simulations predict steep slopes , even at the smallest reliably resolved radii , defined by the so - called convergence radius @xmath39 @xcite . for the h04 dwarf galaxy models @xmath40 kpc or @xmath20 kpc for @xmath41 .",
    "the slope at @xmath39 in the simulations varies between @xmath5 and @xmath42 .",
    "equation  ( 4 ) can be used to derive the slopes implied by the fits to the observed lsb rotation curves . for this one",
    "needs to choose a radius at which the slopes will be evaluated . in the rest of this paper two choices will be used .",
    "firstly , the radius of the innermost measured point of the rotation curve as given in @xcite and @xcite will be considered . here a value of @xmath43 is used ( converted using the appropriate distance ) , which is the typical spacing between data points for the curves presented there . ] .",
    "one might argue that at @xmath44 a different radius is probed for each rotation curve , so , secondly , a constant radius @xmath45 kpc @xmath46 kpc for all curves will be used as well .",
    "one should not expect dramatically different results from both choices though : the average value of @xmath47 is @xmath48 kpc , very much comparable with @xmath39 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that even though we evaluate the slope at these particular choices for the radius , the @xmath10 and @xmath9 parameters ( and therefore the slope ) are constrained by the _ entirety _ of the curve .",
    "figure [ fig : hayslope3 ] shows the distribution of inferred mass density slopes derived using the lsb rotation curves and the best - fit @xmath10 and @xmath9 parameters listed in table 2 of h04 .",
    "the slopes for both @xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc are shown .",
    "it is clear that the distributions are heavily biased towards shallow slopes and very different from the values found in the simulations at these radii @xmath51 .",
    "the small values of @xmath52 derived in h04 indicate that eq .",
    "( 1 ) fits the data well , and the problem is thus not with the quality of the fits . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hayslope3 ] is also indicated the distribution of slopes for the galaxies that h04 claim are consistent with cdm ( their group a with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "this distribution is not markedly different from that of the entire sample . from fig .",
    "[ fig : hayslope3 ] one could thus conclude that the majority of slopes are inconsistent with the cdm prediction .",
    "how can this be reconciled with the h04 conclusions ?    as discussed above , h04 add an extra constraint to the @xmath10-parameter , and argue that the resulting agreement with the range of @xmath10-values shown by the simulations implies consistency with cdm .",
    "this point will be explored in more detail below , but one can already see here that this does not solve the problem of the discrepancy between observed and simulated slopes . consider the distribution of slopes of the subset of group a for which @xmath55 ( and both @xmath56 ) , i.e. galaxies for which the best fit is ( apparently ) already consistent with cdm .",
    "the distribution of slopes of this sub - group is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hayslope3 ] . the selection criteria for this sub - group favour galaxies with steeper slopes ,",
    "and it should thus come as no surprise that the dominant peak at @xmath57 has disappeared .",
    "nevertheless it is remarkable that the distributions are still dominated by slopes @xmath58 .",
    "the distribution using @xmath59 peaks at @xmath60 .",
    "the distribution using @xmath61 kpc peaks at @xmath62 .",
    "as we are probing the slope at @xmath63 kpc and not in the centre , we should not expect all iso haloes to have a flat slope at this radius .",
    "the distribution of slopes found is consistent with that expected at @xmath45 kpc for an ensemble of pseudo - isothermal ( iso ) halos with core - radii between @xmath64 and @xmath65 kpc .",
    "the decrease in mass - density at this radius is thus much less steep than expected for a cdm halo .",
    "the steepest slope expected for a realistic iso halo ( i.e.  consistent with the smallest value @xmath66 kpc measured in real lsb galaxies ; see results in @xcite ) is @xmath67 , with the large majority of iso haloes having slopes less steep than that .",
    "the slopes measured in the h04 simulations at @xmath45 kpc vary between @xmath68 and @xmath42 , firmly inconsistent with the observed distributions .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy can best be appreciated by realizing that according to eq .",
    "( 4 ) the slope is a function of both @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammartfits ] which shows iso - slope contours in the @xmath69 plane , as evaluated at @xmath63 kpc .",
    "it is immediately obvious that @xmath70 is not a unique function of @xmath10 , but depends equally strongly on @xmath9 .",
    "most combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath9 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 yield slopes shallower than @xmath73 . only a very small part of parameter space results in steep , cdm - compatible slopes ( essentially only the area with @xmath74 and/or @xmath75 ) .",
    "constraining @xmath76 does not actually constrain the slope to steep , cdm - like values , but still allows values up to @xmath77 .",
    "over - plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammartfits ] are the best - fit @xmath10 and @xmath9 values of the lsb rotation curves as determined by h04 .",
    "a distinction is made between the entire sample ( groups a , b and c ) , the `` cdm - compatible '' group a , and the sub - group discussed above where the best fit is apparently already cdm - compatible .",
    "the distribution of the points is not very different from group to group , though the @xmath78 subgroup tends to have slightly steeper slopes , as already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hayslope3 ] . regardless of how the total sample is divided up ,",
    "the very large majority of the galaxies have slopes inconsistent with the values @xmath37 derived in the h04 simulations .",
    "note again that the slopes in simulations and observations are compared at _ identical radii _ , and that the @xmath10 and @xmath9 values were derived using the _ entirety of the rotation curves_. the extra constraints introduced by h04 are thus insufficient conditions for agreement with cdm , as constraining to @xmath76 does not automatically imply a mass - density slope consistent with cdm . unless one is prepared to allow for shallow slopes in cdm at these radii ( making it inconsistent with its own simulations ) an extra constraint on the slope is needed to ensure agreement with cdm",
    "adding this extra constraint to the four introduced by h04 is only necessary if these prior constraints are insufficient to make a unique distinction between cdm and non - cdm models .",
    "if , for example , rotation curves known to be inconsistent with cdm are not rejected as such , the prior constraints are clearly insufficient to address cdm - related questions .",
    "one can test the strength of these constraints by `` observing '' a sample of simulated iso haloes .",
    "this will show that the h04 constraints are not sufficient as they imply that the majority of these iso haloes , all with easily detectable shallow slopes , are consistent with cdm .",
    "iso haloes form of course the one model known to be certainly inconsistent with cdm ( if they were not , there would be no cusp / core controversy ) .",
    "the modeling procedure as described in @xcite [ hereafter db03 ] is used .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for an extensive description of these models . the aim there was to estimate the impact of systematic effects on the observations . for that purpose",
    "many different rotation curves were simulated and `` observed '' after the addition of observational uncertainties due to e.g.  resolution effects and random motions .",
    "db03 used the same datasets as the basis of their models as h04 use for their analysis , and the db03 procedure can be directly applied here to test the fitting method and make comparisons with the h04 results .",

    "note that these intervals encompass the entire observed parameter range .",
    "no account is taken of any correlations that might exist between these parameters , nor of any other uncertainties that might be present in the determination of halo parameters .",
    "this is reflected in the range of core - radii , which is somewhat larger than that found from observations ( typically @xmath94 kpc ) .",
    "the choice of parameter ranges is therefore liberal , but sufficient for our purposes : this is not an attempt to model individual galaxies but a _ reductio ad absurdum _ proof of principle .    for each model halo an inclination , resolution and sampling interval",

    "error - bars are assigned to each sampled point , again modeled on the observed distribution of uncertainties , with a minimum value of 4 km s@xmath82 .",
    "the curve is then corrected for inclination with a corresponding increase in the size of the error - bars . to each data point a random velocity component between @xmath95 and @xmath96 km s@xmath82 is added .",
    "this is slightly simpler than the method used in db03 , but results in similarly sized random motions .",
    "lastly , as real rotation curves do not all extend out to the same radius , for each galaxy a random outer radius between 3 and 20 kpc is defined , out to which the galaxy is `` observed '' .",

    "cf .  the remarks in sect .  3",
    "the output distribution has a less pronounced peak at @xmath35 , and a longer tail towards steeper slopes , but as the discussion in @xcite shows , this is fully consistent with the effects of the limited resolution used to `` observe '' the input distribution .",

    "the most surprising outcome though is that of this sample of random iso haloes almost 60 per cent match the h04 cdm criteria .",
    "a comparison of the distribution of slopes in this cdm - compatible sample of haloes with the total distribution shows that there has been no selection against shallow slopes ( fig .",

    "even when the slopes are derived using the constrained `` cdm compatible '' fit parameters , one still finds that 70 per cent has a shallow slope @xmath104 .",
    "as the range in core - radii used for the models is slightly larger than found observationally , the fractions mentioned here should be considered lower limits .",

    "it is clear that the halo models that do not meet the cdm criteria are only guilty of having average densities that are too high or too low .",
    "they are not degenerate , nor do they suffer from e.g.  larger error bars .",
    "a more finely - tuned choice of halo parameters could bring the rejection rate down significantly , but as the input ranges of @xmath93 and @xmath106 are based on observed distributions , it is more likely that real galaxies have a wider range of densities than predicted by cdm , and condition ( iv ) merely selects from a much broader spectrum of galaxy properties those galaxies that happen to lie in the cdm - compatible range .",

    "haloes that were rejected by the @xmath25 criterion are indicated in the right - hand side of the plot . following h04",
    "one can divide the haloes in three categories : _",
    "( group a ) : _ rotation curves that are well fit by eq .  ( 1 ) and for which a good fit with apparently cdm - compatible parameters can also be found , i.e. @xmath107 and @xmath108 . _",
    "( group b ) : _ rotation curves that are well fit by eq .",
    "( 1 ) but for which no good fit with cdm - compatible parameters can be found , usually because of a discrepant value of @xmath25 ; these curves have @xmath109 and @xmath110 or undefined ( i.e. , with @xmath25 out of range ) . _ ( group c ) : _ rotation curves that are poorly fit by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , i.e. @xmath111 and @xmath110 .",
    "the latter category only contains a few galaxies , as there are no large - scale asymmetries in the model rotation curves , and most rise smoothly and monotonically with radius . note the numerical agreement between the observational @xmath112 values presented in h04 and those of the iso models , showing that the additional uncertainties introduced in those models are a good representation of the true observational uncertainties .",
    "models in group a are , according to h04 , `` consistent with @xmath0cdm in terms of their inferred central densities and the shape of their rotation curves . ''",
    "one now has to add several caveats to this statement .",
    "firstly , even with @xmath113 and @xmath114 a steep slope is not guaranteed .",
    "the constraints used to define group a are not sufficient to filter out the shallow slopes that are still present and detectable in the iso models , even after the addition of observational uncertainties .",
    "secondly , as the inner slopes are well - defined and not necessarily steep , the shapes of the rotation curves are also not necessarily consistent with @xmath0cdm .",
    "constraints ( i)-(iii ) thus seem to have had hardly any effect in improving the agreement with cdm .",
    "the only restrictive constraint is condition ( iv ) , the @xmath25 criterion , but even this seems to have only selected models with a certain range in average density from amongst a much larger range of models .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bullock ] where a comparison is made between average @xmath25 densities of the iso models from group a and b with those expected in a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "galaxies in groups a and b are indicated separately . in the h04 interpretation",
    "the iso halos from group a are consistent with cdm in terms of shape and average density , while group b is consistent in terms of shape but not density , even though groups a and b both consist of pure iso haloes , with easily detectable shallow slopes .",
    "the cdm constraints ( i)-(iv ) fail to take this into account and are thus insufficient to distinguish between cdm and non - cdm models .",
    "they can not exclude the possibility that lsb galaxies have shallow inner mass - density slopes , even at @xmath115 .",
    "additional constraints are needed to make a unique identification of galaxies compatible with cdm .",
    "now that it is established that constraints ( i)-(iv ) are not sufficient to uniquely identify cdm - compatible galaxies , the next step is to identify additional conditions that can .",
    "figures  [ fig : courslope ] and [ fig : gammartfits ] show that the inner slope and therefore the shape of the rotation curve do not depend on @xmath10 alone , but that there is an equally strong dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "these figures also explain why h04 came to the conclusion that their four constraints were sufficient : implicit in their analysis is the assumption that the shape of the rotation curve depends on @xmath10 alone .",
    "while it is true that for @xmath116 kpc a smaller @xmath10 implies a steeper slope , this does not ensure a steep slope in an absolute sense . for @xmath76 , depending on the value of @xmath9 ,",
    "slopes as shallow as @xmath117 are still possible .",
    "furthermore , it is shown above that the h04 method does not take these shallow slopes into account , and thus allows models with easily detectable and prominent shallow slopes purpose - built in to pass the cdm test with flying colours .    in order to identify galaxies that are really compatible with cdm ,",
    "an additional constraint is needed , in such a way that only @xmath118 combinations are allowed that yield a steep slope [ as well as pass conditions ( i)-(iv ) ] . in practice",
    "this means that @xmath69 parameter space needs to be searched for the minimum @xmath21 value that still results in a steep slope , one needs to take that parameter into account as well .",
    "this is done by stepping through values of @xmath8 at fixed @xmath10 and @xmath9 , and choosing the value that yields the lowest @xmath21 .",
    "therefore @xmath119 $ ] . ] . in order to compare directly with the simulations the slopes",
    "are again evaluated at @xmath63 kpc . at this radius",
    "the h04 simulations show slopes @xmath120 , and strictly speaking one ought to restrict the search of @xmath121 space to slopes @xmath122 .",
    "however , to take into account uncertainties in data and simulations , and give the cdm models as much leeway as possible , a more liberal range of @xmath123 will be used .",
    "[ fig : slopeonly ] shows that this is the steepest slope we can expect at this radius from an ultra - compact iso halo with @xmath124 kpc , and this value thus cleanly separates the iso and cdm domains .    at this point",
    "a short digression on the significance of @xmath112 is useful . in testing the goodness - of - fit of a model , the reduced @xmath21 , that is",
    ", the total @xmath21 divided by the degrees of freedom of the data , is often used .",
    "a value of @xmath125 is then taken as an indication that the model is a good description of the data .",
    "the reduced @xmath21 is an appropriate statistic when comparing different models to a single set of data , or data with a similar number of degrees of freedom .",
    "an example would be the testing of an nfw model versus an iso model for a single rotation curve , or a set of curves with a similar number of data points .",
    "h04 determine for each lsb rotation curve the reduced @xmath21 for the best - fitting @xmath118 model , as well as the minimum @xmath112 value using their cdm constraints .",
    "they argue that for most of the galaxies the cdm constraints only cause a small increase in the _ reduced _",
    "@xmath21 , and that therefore the cdm - constrained models are not much worse than the best - fit models .",
    "this is not necessarily so .",
    "remember that the reduced @xmath21 is the @xmath21 divided by the degrees of freedom of the data ( the number of data points minus the number of parameters in the model ) .",
    "it is easy to see that in order to cause the same change in _ reduced _ @xmath21 the change in _ absolute _",
    "@xmath21 must be much larger for a rotation curve with a large number of data points than for a rotation curve with a small number of data points .",
    "in other words , a small change in @xmath22 can be very significant ( that is , unlikely to be consistent with the uncertainties in the data points ) for a curve with a large number of data points , while it can be insignificant ( entirely consistent with the uncertainties ) for a curve with only a small number of data points .",
    "the observed sample we are dealing with here contains a large number of rotation curves , with a wide range in the number of data points , varying from @xmath126 to over 350 .",
    "the relevant parameter when judging whether a change in fit parameters yields a model that is still consistent with the data is thus _ not _ the reduced @xmath21 , but the _ change in absolute @xmath21_. the confidence level of any parameter combination is given by the corresponding change in @xmath21 with respect to the minimum value . for a model with three free parameters @xmath127",
    "as used here , the @xmath128 confidence intervals for any fit are given by @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "using these criteria , a rotation curve can be defined to be consistent with cdm if the best - fit values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 lie within @xmath130 of the closest @xmath118 combination with a @xmath131 slope . in order for the fit to give any meaningful constraints",
    ", one should furthermore require that the area enclosed by the @xmath130 confidence level is a small fraction of the total area of parameter space investigated is not crucial .",
    "we have tested the analysis with a @xmath132 level as well .",
    "though the number of badly constrained fits increases , the relative proportions of cdm consistent _ vs _ inconsistent fits does not change appreciably . ] .",
    "if the latter is not the case , then any conclusions regarding agreement or disagreement with cdm are only very weak at best .    here the group a rotation curves , defined in h04 to be consistent with their definition of cdm , are investigated again using the new constraints .",
    "groups b and c are already inconsistent with cdm using the more relaxed h04 constraints , and will therefore not be investigated further . for each rotation curve from group a the minimum @xmath21",
    "was found using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and the change in @xmath21 necessary to be consistent with a slope @xmath123 was determined .",
    "the @xmath133-confidence interval corresponding to this @xmath134 was also calculated , as well as the ratio @xmath135 of the area enclosed by the @xmath130 contour and the total area of @xmath121 parameter space searched @xmath136 kpc ) . as described above",
    ", the ratio @xmath135 is used to determine whether a solution is well - constrained or not .",
    "small values of @xmath135 indicate that the @xmath130 area is only a small fraction of total parameter space , and therefore yield significant solutions .",
    "large values of @xmath135 indicate that the fit does not constrain models in a significant way .",
    "the results are given in table [ table : fit ] , where the galaxies are sorted in order of the number of data - points in each individual rotation curve .",
    "[ fig : chi2surface ] shows the @xmath128 confidence contours for a number of representative galaxies as described below . from studying the plots of the @xmath21 contours for all galaxies",
    ", it was found that a value @xmath137 is a reasonable discriminator between well - constrained and badly constrained fits , but the precise value of @xmath135 is not critical ( see fig .",

    "the galaxies in table [ table : fit ] fall in four distinct categories :    1 .   _",
    "well - constrained solutions , consistent with cdm : _ objects with best fits within @xmath130 of a steep slope @xmath123 parameter combination , and with a well - constrained @xmath139 solution .",

    "[ fig : chi2surface ] .",

    "_ well - constrained solutions , inconsistent with cdm : _ objects with best fits more than @xmath130 away from a steep slope @xmath123 parameter combination , and with a well - constrained @xmath139 solution .",
    "an example is ugc 11819 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2surface ] .",
    "this category contains 17 out of 36 galaxies .",
    "badly constrained solutions , consistent with cdm : _ objects with best fits within @xmath130 of a steep slope @xmath123 parameter combination , but with a badly constrained @xmath140 solution .",
    "an example is f563 - 1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2surface ] .",
    "this category contains 12 out of 36 galaxies .",
    "badly constrained solutions , inconsistent with cdm : _ objects with best fits more than @xmath130 away from a steep slope @xmath123 parameter combination , and with a badly constrained @xmath140 solution .",
    "an example is ddo 185 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2surface ] .",
    "this category contains 4 out of 36 galaxies .",
    "it is clear that only galaxies from the first two categories , i.e.  with @xmath139 , can help constrain halo models .",
    "a glance at table [ table : fit ] shows that most of the solutions that are consistent with cdm are actually badly constrained .",
    "this is investigated further in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolve ] . here",
    "@xmath135 is plotted against the number of data points in each rotation curve .",
    "a distinction is made between rotation curves that are consistent with cdm and those that are inconsistent with cdm using the constraints introduced here .",
    "table [ table : fit ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : resolve ] lead to several conclusions .",
    "firstly , of the 15 galaxies that are consistent with cdm , 13 have less than 30 data points .",
    "furthermore , of these 13 galaxies , only 1 has @xmath139 ( i.e.  is well - constrained ) .",
    "looking at the 21 galaxies that are inconsistent with cdm , only 10 have less than 30 data points .",
    "of these 10 galaxies , all except one have @xmath139 .",
    "rotation curves with more than 30 data points tend to be better constrained on average , as well as have a tendency to be inconsistent with cdm .",
    "it is also interesting to note that even amongst galaxies with only a limited number of data points , the most constrained solutions ( small @xmath135 ) tend to be those inconsistent with cdm .",
    "the majority of solutions @xmath141 per cent ) that are consistent with cdm have only a small number of data points _ and _ are ill - constrained .",
    "these ill - constrained solutions therefore do not decide between any model one way or the other , and statements that these galaxies are consistent with cdm are thus not very strong . of the well - constrained solutions",
    "the large majority is inconsistent with cdm .",
    "furthermore , of the 13 galaxies with more than 30 data points only 2 are consistent with cdm .",
    "these two galaxies ( ngc 3274 and ngc 4455 ) also happen to have the smallest optical scale - lengths and highest surface brightnesses from all galaxies with available photometry in the @xcite , @xcite and @xcite samples : both galaxies have @xmath142 mag arcsec@xmath143 .",
    "these galaxies are therefore unlikely to be dominated by dark matter in their inner parts and it is very likely that the steep slopes in these two galaxies simply reflect the stellar mass distribution ( see also the discussion on ngc 3274 in sec .  9.2.2 of @xcite ) .    amongst the rotation curves with less than 30 points",
    "there is only one galaxy with @xmath144 that seems consistent with cdm .",
    "this is ugc 731 , a bona - fide lsb dwarf , and is the best and only candidate in the entire observed sample for a cdm - consistent , dark - matter - dominated galaxy with a well - constrained solution .",
    "the level of agreement is not perfect though , ugc 731 is consistent with a @xmath145 slope at the @xmath146 confidence level , with the confidence level decreasing to @xmath147 for an @xmath4 slope , which is still only the upper limit of the range of slopes expected from the simulations .",
    "once the steep slope constraint is added to the h04 constraints there are thus only 3 galaxies left that have a well - constrained fit consistent with a steep slope and @xmath0cdm . of these 3 galaxies , 2 are of very high surface brightness and are likely to be dominated by stars in the inner parts , leaving only one possible candidate with a well - constrained cdm - compatible fit .",
    "the large majority of the well - constrained fits strongly prefer shallow slopes .",
    "the 2@xmath133 limit used here already indicates that for many galaxies it is difficult to adjust the fit parameters to get a cdm - compatible fit .",
    "restrictive as this criterion is , it really only gives an upper limit to the true probability .",
    "while one has the freedom to adjust the parameters of an individual fit to test the likelihood of an hypothesis for one particular rotation curve , this becomes problematic when dealing with many fits .",
    "if every fit is individually adjusted to fit a particular model , does that still constitute a proper test ?",
    "an analogue can perhaps be found in some of the first supernova results that indicated the existence of a cosmological constant ( e.g.@xcite ) . the majority of the supernovae in that early work were each individually consistent within @xmath130 with the _ _ non-__existence of @xmath0 .",
    "even though the data showed a systematic trend , each measurement could have been corrected individually to fit the no-@xmath0 model .",
    "however , the joint result of these small inconsistencies has formed the basis for the discovery of the effects of @xmath0 on the expansion of the universe . while it would be presumptuous to compare those results with the current analysis ,",
    "it does show that it is important to pay attention to the global conclusion that is forced upon us by the data .",
    "one thing that is clear is that galaxies that are significantly consistent with @xmath0cdm in terms of their inferred central densities and the shapes of their rotation curves seem to be rare indeed .",
    "i have investigated the claim by h04 that the majority of rotation curves of lsb galaxies are not inconsistent with cdm .",
    "i have shown that the method used is unable to distinguish between shallow and steep slopes , even when these are obviously present and easily detectable .",
    "i illustrate this by showing that with the h04 method one would infer even pseudo - isothermal , core - dominated haloes to be consistent with cdm .",
    "an extra constraint based on the mass - density slope is thus needed to make more definitive statements on any ( dis)agreement with cdm . using this extra criterion",
    "i show that only a quarter of the lsb galaxies can be said to be consistent with cdm , as opposed to the three quarters found by h04 .",
    "the majority of these cdm - consistent lsb galaxies do however have fit parameters that are so ill - constrained , that they are consistent with virtually anything . restricting the analysis to galaxies with well - constrained solutions ,",
    "i find that only 3 out of the 20 well - constrained galaxies are possibly consistent with cdm ; two of these are high surface brightness dwarf galaxies that are likely to be dominated by stars .    in summary , a comparison of the circular velocity profiles of cdm haloes with rotation curves of lsb galaxies indicates that the shapes and inferred central densities of most lsb galaxies are mostly _ inconsistent _ with those of simulated haloes within the limitations imposed by observational error .      alam , s.  m.  k. , bullock , j.  s. , weinberg , d.  h.  2002 , , 572 , 34 binney , j.  2004 , iau symposium , 220 , 3 bullock , j.  s. , kolatt , t.  s. , sigad , y. , somerville , r.  s. , kravtsov , a.  v. , klypin , a.  a. , primack , j.  r. , & dekel , a.  2001 , , 321 , 559 courteau , s.  1997 , , 114 , 2402 de blok , w.  j.  g.  2004 , iau symposium , 220 , 69 de blok , w.  j.  g. , bosma , a.  2002 , , 385 , 816 de blok , w.  j.  g. , mcgaugh , s.  s.  1997 , , 290 , 533 de blok , w.j.g . ,",
