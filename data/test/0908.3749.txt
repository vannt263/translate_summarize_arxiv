    "the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method is an innovative numerical scheme originated from lattice gas automata ( lga)@xcite and aim to simulate various hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "the lb method was introduced to overcome some serious deficiencies of lga , such as intrinsic noise , limited values of transport coefficients , non - galilean invariance , and implementation difficulty in three dimensions . in the past two decades ,",
    "most of the lb models are based on the famous bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) approximation5 where a single relaxation time ( srt ) is used . due to its validity and simplicity ,",
    "the srt lb method has been widely used to simulate various fluid flow problems , such as the multiphase flowshanchen , swift , xgl1,xgl2,xgl6,xsb , ss2007,xu2009 , magnetohydrodynamicsprl1991,7,8,pra1991,pre2002,pre2004,cicp2008 , flows through porous media@xcite and thermal fluid dynamics@xcite , etc .    however , the extreme simplicity of the srt leads also to some constraints for the srt lb model .",
    "for example , the simulation will be unstable when the relaxation time @xmath0 is close to 0.5 , the model works only for low mach number flows .",
    "one possible remedy is to use the multiple relaxation time ( mrt ) method@xcite . in real fluid",
    "the equilibrating rates of mass , momentum , energy , etc .",
    "are generally different .",
    "this difference can be manifested by the non - unique adjustable parameters in the mrt lb model .",
    "in contrast to the srt model , the mrt version has much more adjustable parameters and degrees of freedom .",
    "the relaxation rates of various processes owing to particle collisions may be adjusted independently .",
    "the main strategy of the mrt lb scheme is that the collision step is first calculated in the moment space and then mapped back to the velocity space .",
    "the advection step is still computed in the velocity space . in many cases ,",
    "it has been shown by luo , et al@xcite that the mrt lb model has better numerical stability .",
    "recently , the mrt lb method has attracted considerable interest and much progress has been achieved .",
    "for example , mrt models for viscoelastic fluids@xcite , multiphase flows@xcite , flow with free surfaces18 , etc . were developed ; optimal boundary condition for mrt lb was composed@xcite . to simulate system with temperature field , luo ,",
    "et al.@xcite suggested a hybrid thermal mrt lb model .",
    "these models work only for nearly incompressible fluids with very low mach number .",
    "lb community has long been attempting to construct models for compressible fluids@xcite .",
    "alexander and chen et al.alexander1 constructed a model where the sound speed is adjustable so that the mach number can be enhanced .",
    "li , et al.@xcite gave a model by reforming the velocity space .",
    "sun , et al.@xcite formulated adaptive lb models where the particle velocities are determined by the mean velocity and internal energy .",
    "yan , et al .",
    "@xcite proposed three - speed - three - energy - level models . besides the standard lb mentioned above ,",
    "some researchers have also tried to develop finite difference ( fd ) lb for compressible fluids@xcite , but in the real simulations the accessible mach number is still not large . the model introduced by kataoka and tsutahara@xcite uses only sixteen discrete velocities and hence has a high computational efficiency .    the low - mach number constraint is generally related to a numerical stability problem .",
    "the latter has been partly addressed by a number of techniques , such as the entropic method@xcite , the fix - up scheme@xcite , flux - limiters@xcite and dissipation@xcite techniques . in existing srt models",
    ", it seems that the most effective solution to overcome the low mach number constraint is to introduce artificial viscosity .",
    "but with the artificial viscosity , some fundamental kinetics are not very clear . in many cases , the mrt formulation has been shown to offer improved numerical stability , and provide additional physics . in this paper",
    "we present an energy - conserving multiple relaxation time finite difference lattice boltzmann model for compressible flows with high mach number .",
    "this model is based on the one proposed by kataoka and tsutahara@xcite .",
    "the moment space and transformation matrix are constructed according to the group representation theory .",
    "equilibria of the nonconserved moments in the moment space are chosen when recovering compressible navier - stokes ( ns ) equations through the chapman - enskog ( ce ) expansion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii a brief review to the mrt lb model is presented . in sect .",
    "iii the new model is constructed .",

    "the evolution of the distribution function @xmath1  for the particle velocity @xmath2  is governed by the following equation : @xmath3 \\text { , } \\label{1}\\]]where @xmath1 ( @xmath4 )  is the particle ( equilibrium ) distribution function , @xmath2 represents a group of particle velocities , subscript @xmath5 indicates the particle s direction , @xmath6 , @xmath7  is the number of discrete velocities , the subscript @xmath8  indicates @xmath9  or @xmath10 component , @xmath11 is the collision matrix .",

    "similarly , we also express the moments of distribution function with the column matrix : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is an element of the matrix @xmath23 and is a polynomial of discrete velocities . obviously , the moments are simply linear combination of distribution functions@xmath24 , and the mapping between moment space and velocity space is defined by the linear transformation @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the lb simulation consists of two steps : the collision step and the advection one . in the mrt lb method ,",
    "the advection step is computed in the velocity space .",
    "the collision step is first calculated in the moment space and then mapped to the velocity space .",

    "the collision step is first calculated in the moment space and then mapped back to the velocity space .",
    "the moment space and corresponding transformation matrix are constructed according to the group representation theory .",
    "equilibria of the nonconserved moments are chosen according to the need of recovering compressible navier - stokes equations through the chapman - enskog expansion . in the new model different transport coefficients , such as viscosity and heat conductivity ,",
    "are related to different collision parameters .",
    "consequently , they can be controlled independently .",
    "this flexibility makes the mrt model contain more physical information and easier to satisfy the von neumann stability condition than its srt counterpart .",
    "the new model passed well - known benchmark tests , including ( i ) shock tubes , such as the sod , lax , colella explosion wave , collision of two strong shocks and a new shock tube with high mach number , ( ii ) regular and mach shock reflections , ( iii ) shock wave reaction on cylindrical bubble problems , and ( iv ) couette flow .",
    "this model works for both low and high speeds compressible flows .",
    "both the lb and traditional cfd approach work when the knudsen number is very small , but in the vicinity of shock wave , the system is in a nonequilibrium state , and the traditional euler and navier - stokes descriptions are problematic . for such problems",
