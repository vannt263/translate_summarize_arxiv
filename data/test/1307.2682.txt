    "the evolution of accretion discs is determined by the outward transport of angular momentum , which induces infall of matter toward the orbital center .",
    "it is generally assumed that the accretion rate depends on an effective viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . in magnetized discs",
    "this mechanism is triggered by a linear axisymmetric destabilization , the magnetorotational instability , which occurs when a weak poloidal magnetic field is coupled to rotation ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) . + in hydrodynamic keplerian discs , instead , the presence of an efficient outward transport of angular momentum is still an open question . in this context",
    "there is no linear axisymmetric mechanism of growth , since kepler rotation is stable according to rayleigh criterion . + a possibility is given by the bypass scenario ( ioannou & kakouris 2001 , chagelishvili et al .",
    "2003 ) , where arbitrarily large amplifications of perturbations can occur due to the leading - trailing evolution of shearwise wavenumbers .",
    "these growths occur independently of the presence of a linear instability drive .",
    "this linear mechanism and non - linear interactions , providing a positive feedback loop , could trigger a subcritical transition into turbulence . however , lesur & longaretti ( 2005 ) showed that , while subcritical transition to turbulence indeed occurs in non - stratified discs , values of the shakura - sunyaev @xmath4 parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) are much too low to give rise to an efficient turbulent transport .",
    "if radial stratification is taken into account radial entropy gradients can drive non - linear subcritical baroclinic destabilization leading to positive angular momentum transport ( klahr & bodenheimer 2003 , lesur & papaloizou 2010 ) and formation of vortices .",
    "+ however , discs are in general radially and vertically stratified and the angular velocity is a function of both radial and vertical coordinates ( kippenhahm & thomas 1982 , urpin 1984 ) .",
    "vertical velocity shear drives an axisymmetric instability ( goldreich & schubert 1967 ; urpin 2003 ) which can result in positive transport of angular momentum in the non - linear regime ( arlt & urpin 2004 ) .",
    "the linear destabilization mechanism was derived by means of a local dispersion relation in the full cylindrical geometry .",
    "instability occurs when @xmath5 .",
    "+ in a recent study nelson , gressel & umurhan ( 2012 ) found that in non - axisymmetric non - linear simulations outward transport can occur with @xmath6 .",
    "vertical convection is another possible path to turbulence .",
    "ryu & goodman ( 1992 ) showed , by means of a linear analysis , that an unstable vertical stratification is not favourable for accretion ; angular momentum transport occurs , but inward .",
    "stone & balbus ( 1996 ) extended the analysis to non - linear regimes with analogous results .",
    "departures from this picture are however possible as shown by lesur & ogilvie ( 2010 ) , in the strongly non - linear regime of high rayleigh number , and by volponi ( 2010 ) , for linear non - axisymmetric boussinesq perturbations in discs with radial and vertical stratification .    in the present study we will concentrate on the vertical shear and vertical convective instabilities .",
    "precisely , first , we will extend the linear analysis of the vertical shear instability to non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "results will be derived by solving the shearing sheet equations in the presence of vertical velocity shear ( knobloch & spruit 1986 ) and in the short wavelength regime .",
    "we will show that , while non - axisymmetric perturbations eventually decay , they experience transient exponential growths which are indistinguishable from a genuine instability .",
    "+ second , we will study the interaction between the vertical shear and convective instabilities .",
    "this is the central part of the present study .",
    "we will show that the presence of vertical shear changes the direction of the vertical convection induced angular momentum transport from inward to outward depending on the sign of the product of vertical and radial wavenumbers ( i.e. positive for @xmath7 or negative for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the local vertical shear ) .",
    "thermal diffusion has a stabilizing influence on the convective instability , specially for short wavelengths .",
    "in the shearing sheet approximation , the equations governing the dynamics of a 3-dimensional disc are @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are density and pressure , @xmath15 is the fluid velocity , @xmath16 is a measure of the fluid entropy , @xmath17 is the adiabatic index , @xmath18 is the local rotation frequency and @xmath19 is the shear parameter ( @xmath20 for keplerian rotation ) .",
    "the term @xmath21 is the coriolis term , @xmath22 is the tidal expansion of the effective potential and @xmath23 is the vertical gravitational acceleration .",
    "the equations are expressed in terms of the pseudo - cartesian coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 are reference radius and angle ) .",
    "+ the above equations are more manageable than the full equations in cylindrical geometry due to the neglect of curvature effects .",
    "the simplification holds if the length scale of radial gradients @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cylindrical radial coordinate ( knobloch & spruit 1986 ) .",
    "+ we consider fully stratified ( i.e. radially and vertically ) baroclinic discs . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the equilibrium pressure and density .",
    "equilibrium in general requires the angular velocity to be @xmath33 and @xmath26 dependent .",
    "+ the equilibrium velocity field is then given by @xmath34\\hat{{\\mbox{\\bf y } } } , \\label{eq1.4}\\ ] ] which is obtained from the expansion of the angular velocity profile about the midplane as given in kley & lin ( 1992 ) ( see as well urpin 1984 ) , in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "the dimensional coefficient @xmath36 can be derived from equation ( a23 ) of kley & lin ( 1992 ) .",
    "+ the @xmath26 dependence gives rise to vertical shear at the origin of the axisymmetric vertical shear instability .",
    "notice that at the midplane the vertical shear goes to zero , so the instability drive is present away from it .",
    "this is the most interesting region for the present analysis .",
    "away from the midplane we can approximate the last @xmath26-quadratic term , @xmath37 , in  ( [ eq1.4 ] ) with a linear one , @xmath38 .",
    "therefore in the following our reference equilibrium flow will be @xmath39\\hat{{\\mbox{\\bf y } } } , \\label{eq1.6}\\ ] ] bearing in mind that our conclusions will not hold at the midplane .",
    "the second term on the rhs of the above equation will be dealt with as in johnson & gammie ( 2005 ) by considering the background flow as giving an effective shear rate @xmath40 that varies with @xmath33 .",
    "+ vertical equilibrium gives @xmath41 by defining @xmath42 we obtain from  ( [ eq1.8 ] ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "we decompose the physical variables in equilibrium and perturbation parts @xmath45 and consider the linearized equations . localized on the @xmath33 and @xmath26 dependent flow ( see johnson & gammie 2005 ) and on the @xmath33 and @xmath26 dependent density and pressure backgrounds , we consider short wavelength eulerian perturbations of the type @xmath46 where @xmath47 notice that due to the presence of vertical shear the vertical wavenumber as well evolves with time .",
    "the @xmath33 dependence in @xmath48 is very weak and in the rest of the paper we will consider the effective shear parameter constant and very close to its keplerian value . +",
    "as previously stated to be consistent with the neglect of the curvature terms we consider a background with radial and vertical length scales @xmath29 and @xmath49 .",
    "the short wavelength perturbations are such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
