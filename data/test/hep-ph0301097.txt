    "in this report we study the consequences of genuine dimension - six ( dim-6 ) higgs operators .",
    "these operators can be induced by integrating out heavy massive degrees of freedom in a theory beyond the sm , or they may reflect the composite nature of the higgs boson . their existence would provide indirect signatures of new physics that couples significantly to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "most naturally , they may be interpreted as the first set of operators in a series with rising dimensionality of order @xmath15 .",

    "at the dimension - six level , operators involving four sm light fermions are subject to stringent constraints from the current experimental measurements at low energies @xcite .",
    "several operators involving sm gauge bosons and the higgs field are also constrained from the precision electroweak data and from the triple gauge boson self - interactions @xcite .",
    "the operators involving the top quark and higgs field seem to be less constrained .",
    "however , since they are usually related to anomalous couplings of @xmath24 and @xmath25 by gauge invariance , they will be studied to a high precision when large samples of top quarks are available at hadron colliders @xcite and future linear colliders @xcite .",

    "this implies that @xmath34 or @xmath35 if @xmath36 tev .",

    "in particular , the @xmath27-parameter will not be affected by these two operators .",
    "before we study the physical consequences of the operators , it is interesting to relate this set - up of operators to another approach , the higgs potential expansion .",
    "a general higgs potential with higher dimensional operators can be constructed as @xcite @xmath39 this expansion systematically includes all higher order terms in the effective higgs potential .",

    "( [ peter ] ) is clearly motivated by the small field expansion of the potential around the vacuum @xmath42 , which is fixed at any given order with @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , the general dim-6 expansion in eq .",
    "( [ lp ] ) includes derivative operators that lead to corrections to the kinetic terms and the higgs - field derivative couplings .",
    "higher dimensional operators can arise from integrating out heavy massive degrees of freedom in theories beyond the sm , or via radiative corrections . in weakly coupled theories such as supersymmetry ,",
    "the effects are typically small before reaching the new physics threshold .",
    "the contribution is usually loop - induced and it is suppressed by a factor of @xmath44 . however , if new strong dynamics is involved in the electroweak sector @xcite , the effects could be quite appreciable .",
    "in particular , the higgs self - interactions parameterized by the dim-6 operators may be significant @xcite .",
    "the effects of these operators on the triviality and stability of the theory were studied in @xcite .      in the presence of dim-6 operators ,",
    "the modified effective higgs potential may be written as @xmath45 electroweak symmetry breaking is obtained via a non - zero vacuum expectation value of the scalar field . minimizing the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) with respect to @xmath46 leads to the following expression for the ground state of the field : @xmath47    interpreting the dim-6 operators as small corrections in the vicinity of the local minimum of the higgs potential , the new term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) should be bounded by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the standard vev of the higgs field in the sm limit . at the same time the signs of the bilinear coupling @xmath10 and the quartic coupling @xmath50",
    "must be fixed such that the standard model is reproduced for large @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the sign in the solution ( [ vevtext ] ) must be chosen positive for the solution close to the standard model .",
    "@xmath52 may acquire either sign .",
    "[ alternative assignments and their consequences are discussed in the appendix . ] expanding the solution in @xmath53 , we find for the ground state of the higgs field : @xmath54 where we have rewritten the expression in terms of the minimal sm vev @xmath55 .",
    "thus the dim-6 addition to the higgs potential leads to a small shift of the higgs field in the vacuum , decreasing or increasing its strength depending on whether the dim-6 part of the potential is repulsive or attractive .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is determined by the fermi coupling @xmath56 as noted earlier .",
    "we first note that the dim-6 operator @xmath57 affects the kinetic terms of the higgs boson propagation , see eq .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ kin ] ) .",
    "thus we must re - scale the field @xmath58 to define the canonically normalized higgs field @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 with this field - redefinition , we find for the physical higgs boson mass @xmath62 where @xmath63 eq .  ( [ mhtext ] ) implies that the higgs mass @xmath64 and the higgs self - coupling @xmath14 are in general independent parameters when new physics beyond the sm is taken into account .",
    "the mass does not only depend on the quartic coupling but also on the small but otherwise arbitrary dim-6 couplings of the generalized potential .",
    "since the higgs boson mass will be directly measured with very high precision , it is more natural to express all observables in terms of @xmath64 instead of @xmath14 , as we will do for the rest of the paper .    for the higgs couplings to the sm particles",

    "they grow with energy and thus will be more significant in a multi - tev collider . the @xmath70 operator",
    ", however , affects only the strength of the standard triple and quartic higgs boson self - interactions .",
    "some details are given in the appendix .",
    "unlike many studies in the literature which discuss the achievable accuracies to determine the higgs couplings in the sm , we stress that our treatment is a consistent approach to systematically include new physics effects in the higgs sector beyond the sm up to the order of @xmath53 .",
    "in addition to the higgs mass , we have introduced two new parameters , @xmath71 , referred to as _ higgs anomalous couplings _ , each of which in turn is related to a model parameter @xmath20 and the new physics cutoff scale @xmath19 .",
    "if we naively set the cutoff scale to a value of 1 tev , we have @xmath72 .",
    "in the rest of the paper , we explore the range of parameters @xmath73 which allows @xmath20 to be about @xmath74 or less .",
    "the expected higgs signal cross section depends upon the anomalous couplings . assuming the signal cross section can be factorized as a product of the sm cross section and a factor depending on the anomalous couplings , @xmath75 we can relate the accuracy of the cross section measurements to the change of the anomalous couplings @xmath76 we identify the relative error on the signal cross section measurement as the statistical uncertainty of the experiment @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the expected signal events with an integrated luminosity @xmath79",

    "the above estimate is based on simple gaussian statistics , so the event sample should be sizable , typically @xmath83 or so . also note that a realistic event determination should include the branching fraction and experimental efficiency factors for a specific channel , which should be folded in to @xmath84 and @xmath80 here .",

( [ vev ] ) for large @xmath19 : @xmath198 it turns out that following the symmetric minimum at @xmath199 , there is a maximum at @xmath170 , and there is a minimum at @xmath200 , either above or below @xmath201 .",
    "this scenario is undesirable from a theoretical point of view in any case .",
    "the reason is that the feasible vacuum @xmath200 is determined by @xmath202 , and if we consider the dim-6 operators as corrections to the sm potential , we wish the vacuum not to be determined by the correction term or by the cutoff scale @xmath19 , but rather to recover the sm by taking the decoupling limit @xmath203 , which would not be achieved if we accept this vacuum .    0.2 cm in this case , following the symmetric maximum at @xmath204 , the vacuum solution is realized for large @xmath19 : @xmath205 again , as discussed above , the solution is determined by the cutoff scale @xmath19 , and would not be desirable to pursue .",
    "we first note that the dim-6 operator @xmath57 corrects the kinetic terms of the higgs boson propagation , as seen from eq .",

    "the higgs self - interactions are from @xmath152 , ( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) and we write them in terms of the three - point and four - point couplings @xmath212 the feynman rules for the higgs self - coupling vertices are given as @xmath213                                      a. datta , b.l .",
