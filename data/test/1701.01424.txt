    "the phenomena of diffusion and transport over a potential energy landscape play a key role in a number of processes in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "josephson tunneling junctions , superionic conductors , phase - locked - loop frequency control systems , charge density waves are a few examples of systems in which these processes in periodic potential are important @xcite .    in recent years",
    "the interest has been growing to experimental studies of manipulating the particle diffusion by external fields .",
    "one can effectively control the diffusion processes by varying the field parameters .",
    "for instance , huge enhancement in diffusivity ( exceeding its value in the same system without extra forcing by a factor of order hundreds ) was observed in studying particle diffusion in colloids with optical traps ( optical vortices ) @xcite . large increase in diffusivity",
    "was also observed in studies of paramagnetic particle diffusion on surfaces of garnet ferrites influenced by external time - periodic magnetic field @xcite . in the same manner diffusivity growth with shaking strength was noticed in experiments with granular gas @xcite .",
    "it turned possible to increase the diffusivity of ions in membrane channels by varying the external electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "one can increase the rates of diffusion - limited physical processes , and effectively separate micro- and nano - particles of different nature by varying diffusion coefficients in different directions @xcite . despite these remarkable achievements , quantitative description of such enhanced diffusion under",
    "the influence of external forces remains fragmentary to date .",
    "special cases of underdamped and overdamped physical systems are often considered . in overdamped systems",
    "inertial effects may be neglected , significantly simplifying the mathematical treatment of the problem . in underdamped systems on the other hand",
    "the viscous decay of oscillations occurs on times long compared with the oscillation period in the potential ; such systems are harder to investigate , and the progress in studying these is more limited compared with overdamped ones .",
    "first detailed studies of a brownian particle motion in a washboard potential ( _ i.e. _ a periodic potential tilted with an additional constant force field ) were carried out by h.  risken and colleagues @xcite , for all values of the friction .",
    "it was shown that at low friction the appearance of locked  ( in which the particle oscillates around one minimum of the potential ) and running  ( where the particle travels through many potential periods , not getting trapped at separate minima ) solutions was important for the particle ensemble behavior . at small temperatures",
    "running solutions appear abruptly at the external force value exceeding certain critical @xmath3 ; at smaller forces a single class of solutions ( locked ) is realized .",
    "systematization of the results of these studies may be found in authoritative monograph @xcite .",
    "approximate solution of the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the coordinate and velocity distribution function was the central moment of these studies .",
    "two different approaches were used , that were checked to produce compatible results .    in the first of these @xcite by expanding the distribution function in hermite functions in velocity and fourier - series in space coordinate , the fokker - planck equation was transformed into an infinite set of coupled equations for the expansion coefficients .",
    "these equations were solved by a matrix continued fraction method .",
    "particle flux was then expressed through the expansion coefficients , after appropriate series truncation . at smaller friction progressively more terms",
    "must be kept , making this method less efficient .",
    "another approach @xcite is best suited for low friction , when the energy becomes a slow variable ( changing on friction dissipation timescales ) .",
    "the distribution function was rewritten in the energy and configuration space coordinate variables , fpe was solved in these new variables with the help of physically - motivated self - consistent ansatz .",
    "many illuminating results were obtained for the distribution functions at various parameter values , stability domains of locked and running solutions , plots of the mean particle velocity , etc .",
    "diffusion properties however remained not studied .",
    "this matter was partly addressed in other works , based on simulations of the stochastic langevin equation",
    ".    early systematic study of diffusion by means of numerical simulation of the langevin equation in periodic potential with extra constant forcing was undertaken in @xcite ( similar simulations were reported in @xcite for forcing with a time - periodic component ) .",
    "costantini & marchesoni analyzed both overdamped and underdamped settings . at low dissipation",
    "they observed significant enhancement of the spatial diffusion near the critical force @xmath3 ( @xcite , fig .  1 : diffusivity ten times larger than its post - maximum value at @xmath4 , at the temperature equal to 0.6 of the potential well depth @xmath5 ) , and related that to features of the particle jump statistics and locked - to - running transition .",
    "further progress in studies of the diffusion under the action of constant force was made in @xcite .",
    "time - dependence of the particle ensemble dispersion was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown for the first time that in underdamped systems a special regime of dispersionless transport was realized , in which dispersion virtually does not change with time , on certain limited interval of time .",
    "the authors explained this phenomenon , they showed that strongly non - equilibrium distribution of particles in space ( with steep front and exponential tail ; formed as the particles first exit their original potential well ) persists for long times , before eventually broadening and assuming normal gaussian shape .",
    "the temperature dependence of the diffusivity was studied as well @xcite .",
    "the authors observed that the maximal diffusivity @xmath6 was achieved near the @xmath3 . at low friction @xmath6",
    "was shown to depend abnormally on the temperature  increase with decreasing temperature @xmath7 .",
    "fitting ( for the three temperatures studied ) yielded @xmath8 relation .",
    "the presence of such abnormal temperature dependence is one important aspect in which underdamped systems differ from overdamped ones .",
    "in fact , certain peculiarities in diffusivity at low temperatures are observed ( for driven brownian particles in space - periodic potentials ) in overdamped situation as well .",
    "p. reimann and colleagues @xcite showed analytically that for a sinusoidal in space potential at external constant force value near @xmath9 , the value required for direct particle pull over the potential barrier ( eq .  [ eq : flat ] below , p.  ) , the ratio of @xmath10 to the diffusivity value @xmath11 in the viscous medium without lattice and bias forces grows at temperature decreasing @xmath12 . yet",
    "the diffusivity itself still vanishes at @xmath13 , as @xmath14 @xcite , and grows monotonically for all @xmath7 .",
    "regions with @xmath15 were obtained in overdamped problem in @xcite ( cf .",
    "fig .  6 ) for specially crafted exotic potential , flat apart from narrow peaks .",
    "the authors linked this abnormal diffusivity behavior to the large ratio of relaxation to escape time in such a system .",
    "similar abnormal @xmath16 behavior was found in @xcite ( cf .",
    "24 ) for piecewise linear potential at extreme asymmetry , essentially sawtooth .",
    "so , while possible at large friction , special atypical conditions must be met for existence of parameters @xmath17 at which @xmath15 . on the contrary ,",
    "such parameters exist universally in the problem with small friction ( @xcite , more below ) .",
    "another distinction of the diffusivity in overdamped problem is that the maximum in @xmath18 is achieved close to the @xmath9 . whereas at low friction @xmath19 is achieved at ( typically much smaller ) @xmath20 .",
    "experimental data for diffusion of colloidal particles in a tilted potential created with laser traps @xcite , fig .  1 , agreed reasonably well with this analytic @xcite @xmath18 dependence . the potential barrier height and the free diffusion coefficient were treated as fit parameters .",
    "similarly , diffusivity in @xcite ( fig .  7 ) showed peaked at @xmath9 behavior , and agreed fairly well with analytic predictions from @xcite with the potential form inferred from independent study of the colloidal particle spatial distribution function . in this work colloidal particles diffused over the potential created by the bottom grid of colloidal spheres , and extra constant forcing was due to gravity ( controlled by the sample inclination angle ) .",
    "different limiting cases of analytic predictions @xcite for the mean particle velocity and diffusivity were compared with experimental results at different settings , and showed good agreement .",
    "the physical reason behind the abnormal temperature dependence of diffusivity in underdamped systems is traced to increasing jump length of running particles ( before getting retrapped at another potential minimum ) with the temperature decrease @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon being absent in overdamped systems ( as these have no proper running states ) .",
    "the maximal diffusivity is achieved at forcing near @xmath20 , as at this value populations of locked and running particles are about equal , and it is the mutual motion between these two populations ( with temperature - independent running particle speed ) that leads to fast spreading of the particle packet , manifested as giant diffusion @xcite .",
    "more thorough analysis of ( the temperature- and force - dependence of ) the diffusion in underdamped systems was carried out in @xcite . it was shown by numeric simulations of the langevin equation that the phenomenon of diffusivity growth with the temperature decreasing ( in the current work called tad , `` temperature - abnormal diffusivity '' ) was only manifested in a narrow interval of applied external forcing .",
    "study in a wide range of temperatures demonstrated that the diffusivity grew with decreasing temperature as @xmath21}$ ] for certain @xmath22 , checked valid for @xmath23 $ ] ; whereas the power - law fit @xmath8 proposed in @xcite could approximate the results only in the narrow temperature range studied by the authors .",
    "we showed that the main exponential growth resulted from such of the correlation time at the temperature decreasing ( found from the simulation results ) .",
    "the diffusion properties were further elucidated and systematized for a broad range of the forces @xmath24 , friction coefficients @xmath25 and temperatures @xmath7 in @xcite , in sinusoidal 1d potential in underdamped setting .",
    "we introduced a velocity potential @xmath26 , which in part governed time evolution of certain slow ( not changing much on times of order one period @xmath27 of small oscillations in the potential , rather evolving on viscous dissipation timescales ) velocity variable , defined through a discrete quantity , maximal velocity in such consecutive oscillations .",
    "with certain reservations that @xmath26 also defined the velocity distribution function @xmath28 agreeing well with the one found numerically .",
    "the latter showed clear bimodal structure with maxima at @xmath29 ( locked states ) and @xmath30 ( running ones ) at intermediate forcing values . in this region of forcing values tad",
    "was observed .",
    "analytic expressions for the mean particle velocity @xmath31 and diffusivity were obtained with the model @xmath28 , good agreement was shown with direct langevin equation simulation results .",
    "simple fits were proposed determining the model parameters [ entering @xmath26 and @xmath28 ] through @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which  apart from usefulness for experimentalists / applications  allowed one to comprehend the features of transport and diffusivity in all the physical parameter space .",

    "[ s : results ] , p.   below .      in practical applications periodic in time external forces ( electromagnetic , acoustic , etc .",
    ") are more straightforwardly realized than constant forcing .",
    "it is natural to study how the findings for the constant forcing problem are modified for the time - periodic forcing setup , both from theoretical and practical point of view . by changing the diffusivity with the aid of periodic external fields it is possible to create surface structures with prescribed properties ; influence the dynamics of point defects , under irradiation in part ; alter the dislocation motion dynamics ; increase chemical reaction rates in selected directions ; manipulate the efficiency of processes in biological systems , to mention just a few applications @xcite .",
    "most of the works on periodic forcing deal with ratchet - type systems @xcite or stochastic resonance .",
    "studies focusing on diffusion properties are scarce .",
    "we are not aware of any works that systematically study the combined dependence of the diffusivity on the temperature , the forcing amplitude and frequency in a representatively broad range of these parameters .",
    "dependence of the diffusivity on the interplay between the external periodic ( piecewise constant , eq .",
    "[ f : pcp ] on p.   below ) forcing and the lattice force was studied in @xcite in 2d overdamped setup .",
    "the forcing frequency was fixed at one value .",
    "it was shown that in a system with a sum of yukawa potentials at square grid nodes the particle diffusivity was significantly enhanced for certain intricate set of bands ( `` a - windows '' ) of the forcing amplitudes and orientations with respect to the grid . at special forcing arrangement tad",
    "was observed for some diffusivity tensor components , and one of its principal values increased exponentially with inverse temperature .",
    "the other diffusivity tensor principal value decreased exponentially at the same time .",
    "it is likely that multi - dimensionality effects were crucial for tad . instead of having two , locked and running , populations in 1d accounting for ( already sophisticated in this case ) diffusion features , flows in higher dimensional problems are far more complex , known to result in further peculiarities in transport and diffusion @xcite .",

    "sinusoidal in time forcing .",
    "diffusivity enhancement by orders of magnitude was seen .",
    "tad was observed for some ( low ) forcing frequencies , at the forcing amplitude @xmath34 studied .",
    "dependence of the diffusivity on the forcing frequency was studied in more detail in @xcite , and was shown to be nonmonotonic at large forcing amplitudes ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 , at @xmath36  k , @xmath37 . ) at @xmath34 the maximum in the frequency dependence of the diffusivity @xmath38 persisted for all the temperatures studied , corresponding frequency @xmath39 increasing from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ( in units of the potential eigenfrequency ) at @xmath7 varying from 120 to 360  k , @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the goal of the present work is to investigate in detail the dependence of the diffusivity on the amplitude and the frequency of uniform time - periodic external forcing in a 1d underdamped space - periodic system , and conditions under which tad is realized .",

    ", to about @xmath282 ( dimensionful frequency @xmath283 of the potential eigenfrequency @xmath284 ) @xmath285 decays with @xmath0 according to a power - law .",
    "the exponent of this decay is related to the superdiffusion stage exponent @xmath101 . at yet larger frequencies non - equilibrium effects slow down the power - law decay of @xmath285 , and , after a local maximum in @xmath285 near @xmath286 , @xmath104 tends to its asymptotic value coinciding with the diffusivity in the absence of external forcing .    at small forcing amplitudes , in regions i and ii , @xmath285 decreases monotonically with frequency @xmath0 from its value at constant forcing , all the way till the non - equilibrium effects become critical , at @xmath287 . at stronger",
    "forcing , region iii , @xmath172 is nonmonotonic , a maximum is reached at @xmath288 .",
    "@xmath172 grows monotonically on @xmath289 , this growth is approximately linear on certain interval to the left of @xmath198 .",
    "we studied the temperature dependence of the diffusivity at fixed @xmath75 .",
    "contrary to the constant forcing problem @xcite the diffusivity increases with the temperature for all @xmath61 when the temperature is below certain frequency - dependent threshold value .",
    "limited temperature intervals exist for the force amplitudes in regions ii and iii , in which the diffusivity decreases with the temperature ( `` temperature - abnormal diffusivity '' , tad ) .",
    "the physical reason behind the strong diffusivity enhancement is emergence of two populations of particles under the action of external force , locked and running ones . at optimal @xmath61 and",
    "@xmath7 the number of particles in the two populations is comparable , long flights of the running particles relative to the locked population take place with significant probability , resulting in giant enhancement of diffusion .    for comparison we studied diffusivity under sinusoidal in time driving .",
    "we saw that the same features in @xmath172 are observed in the three regions of force amplitudes as in pcp driving case .",
    "we thus conjecture that the qualitative features of @xmath290 behavior are insensitive to specific functional dependence of the ( symmetric , smooth enough in @xmath46 ) external force on time .",
    "the effects investigated allow for simple experimental verification .",
    "diffusion of particles on solid body surface is one natural arena for this .",
    "such systems are characterized by low dissipation @xcite .",

    "e.g. _ , enhanced growth of islands of the new phase at decreasing temperatures .",
    "once verified experimentally , the effect of abnormal diffusion enhancement can find applications in a number of new technologies : in sorting of particles , manufacturing surface structures with required properties , controlling penetration of particles through biological and artificial membranes , in memristors , devices with charge density waves , etc .",
