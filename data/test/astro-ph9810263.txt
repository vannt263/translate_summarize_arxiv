    "variability is one of the defining properties of blazars , characterized by variations of their flux even of two orders of magnitude in time scales of years , and smaller changes , but still up to factor 2 , in hours / days time scales .",
    "observational efforts to characterize the variability behaviour , which started soon after the discovery of blazars , have been intensified in recent years , to study very fast fluctuations and possible correlation of fluxes at different frequencies ( for a review see ulrich , urry & maraschi , 1997 ) .",
    "this will hopefully shed light on the location of the emitting regions and on the nature of the acceleration mechanisms .",
    "theoretical efforts , however , lag behind observations : the classical paper on time dependent synchrotron and compton flux is still kardashev ( 1962 ) , which solves the continuity equations for the particle distribution in cases where the cooling time @xmath0 can be considered longer than the light crossing time @xmath1 for any energy .",
    "recently , mastichiadis & kirk ( 1997 ) and atoyan & aharonian ( 1997 ) , apply the results of solving the continuity equation for the electron distribution to the variations seen in the bl lac object mkn 421 and the galactic superluminal source grs 1915 + 105 . in both cases , only the variability on time scales longer than @xmath1 were studied . on the other hand",
    ", significant variability often happens on time scales extremely short in highly luminous ( and compact ) objects .",
    "this implies that the cooling time for the highest energy electron may well be shorter than @xmath1 , even once the effect of doppler boosting and blueshift is accounted for .",
    "this is also indicated by the behaviour of the light curves as seen , e.g. , in the x ",
    "rays and in the optical , showing a quasi ",
    "symmetric behaviour , with rise and decay time scales approximately equal ( see i.e. urry et al . 1997 , ghisellini et al .",
    "1997 , massaro et al .",
    "1996 , giommi et al .",
    "1998 ) , indicating that both times are connected to the light travel time across the source @xmath1 , and therefore suggesting that the cooling times of the emitting electrons are shorter .",
    "this in turn implies that the electron distribution , at least at these energies , is significantly changing on time scales shorter than @xmath1 .    in these cases",
    "the knowledge of the time evolution of the particle distribution of the emitting electrons is not enough to construct theoretical light curves for the @xmath2 fluxes , since light travel time effects play a crucial role .",
    "the observer in fact sees , at any given time , photons produced in different part of the source , characterized by a particle distribution of a different age .",
    "the observed flux is then the sum of the emission produced by _",
    "different _ particle distributions .    in  2 of this paper we present our method of solving the continuity equation for the emitting particle distribution , together with the assumptions made . in ",
    "3 we discuss illustrative examples of the time behaviour of the particle and photons distributions , having care to evidentiate the effects introduced by the different photon travel times . besides considering simple illustrative cases where the injection of ` fresh ' relativistic particles is assumed to occur simultaneously throughout the source , we also study more realistic cases which simulate the injection occuring when a shock front travels down a region of a jet . in ",
    "4 we apply our model to mkn 421 , to show how it is possible , even in our simplified model , to explain the time lags observed in the hard and soft x ",
    "ray light curves .",
    "finally , in  5 we discuss our findings .",
    "we assume that the emission is produced by a distribution of relativistic electrons injected in a region of typical dimension @xmath3 embedded in a tangled magnetic field @xmath4 , at a rate @xmath5 [ @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the lorentz factor ) .",
    "electrons lose energy by emitting synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton radiation ( ssc ) ; they can also escape from the emitting region in a time scale @xmath9 , assumed to be independent of energy .",
    "our main purpose is to apply our calculations to the study of the blazars short time scales variability , especially in frequency bands around and above the peaks of blazars spectral energy distribution . in these spectral regions synchrotron self - absorption is negligible , and",
    "consequently we neglect this heating effect in the kinetic equation ( e.g. ghisellini , guilbert & svensson , 1988 ) .",
    "photon  photon collisions , producing electron  positron pairs , are also neglected , since we will deal with sources of small compactness @xmath10 ( maraschi , ghisellini & celotti , 1992 )    the continuity equation governing the temporal evolution of the electrons distribution @xmath11 [ @xmath6 ] is @xmath13 + q(\\gamma , t ) -   \\frac{n(\\gamma , t)}{t_{esc } } \\label{cont}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the total cooling rate , given by @xmath15   \\gamma^2\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the thomson cross section , @xmath17 is the magnetic field energy density and @xmath18 is the energy density of the radiation field .",

    "we numerically solve equation ( [ cont ] ) adopting the fully implicit difference scheme proposed by chang & cooper ( 1970 ) , modified for our purposes , since we are dealing with a continuity equation with injection and escape terms and no heating .",
    "the chang & cooper ( 1970 ) scheme allows to find more stable , non - negative and particle number conserving solutions .",
    "moreover that scheme significantly reduces the number of meshpoints required to obtain accurate solutions , and it is also appropriate for including heating terms ( ghisellini , guilbert & svensson , 1988 ) .    for all our runs we use an energy grid with equal logaritmic resolution : the energy meshpoints are defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the meshpoints number , and the energy intervals are @xmath26 .",
    "quantities with the subscript @xmath27 are calculated at half grid points . in the performed simulations",
    "a grid of 200 points has been used both for particle energy and photon frequency .    in order to discretize the continuity equation we define @xmath28    @xmath29    and equation ( [ cont ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath30 in this specific case we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 , according to the prescriptions of chang & cooper ( 1970 ) .",
    "we can now rewrite the continuity equation as @xmath33 where the v coefficients are @xmath34 and @xmath35 the system of equations ( [ sys ] ) forms a tridiagonal matrix , and it is solved numerically ( e.g. press et al .",
    "we tested our method with the analitic solutions given by kardashev ( 1962 ) in the case of synchrotron radiation only and injection of a constant power  law and monoenergetic distributions .",

    "+      the knowledge of @xmath71 is not sufficient to properly reproduce the variability behaviour of blazars : observations in the optical band and at higher frequencies strongly suggest that the injection and/or the cooling times can be shorter than the light crossing time @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the particle distribution evolves more rapidly than @xmath1 _ and the observer will see a convolution of different spectra , each produced in a different part of the source_. initially the observer only sees the emission coming from fresh electrons located in the region ( ` slice ' ) closest to her / him ; then the innner parts of the source become visible , also showing ` young ' spectra , while electrons in the front slices are evolving . after a time @xmath1 all the emitting region will be visible : the back of it with fresh electrons and the front of it with older electrons .    in order to reproduce this effect",
    "we can divide the source of size @xmath3 into @xmath72 slices of equal thickness @xmath73 and then sum the contribution of each slice to obtain the correct observed spectrum .",
    "note that the number of slices has to be chosen in order to have @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the shorter among the relevant time scales ( cooling , injection and escape time ) : in this way each slice can be considered an _ homogeneous _ region , while the different slices are observed in a different evolution time , resembling an _ inhomogeneous _ emitting region .",
    "we consider the case in which all slices have equal volumes , and assume a ` cubic ' geometry , with the line of sight placed at 90@xmath76 with respect to one face of the cube .",
    "this angle , besides corresponding to the simplest case , is transformed , in the lab frame , into a viewing angle of @xmath77 , if the source moves with a lorentz factor @xmath78 , which is appropriate for blazars .",
    "extension to different geometries ( i.e. cylinder , sphere , etc ) is trivial , by properly weighting each slice volume .",
    "we will see that even in the simplest , ` cubic ' , case , time - lags among light curves at different frequencies are clearly observable .",
    "we note that the light crossing time effects should be taken into account also for the correct calculation of the inverse compton radiation : synchrotron photons in fact require a time @xmath1 to fill the whole of the emitting region .",
    "this effect , relatively important for transient high energy phenomena in compton dominated sources , is however negligible for magnetic dominated objects , and we neglect it in the present paper , due to the computing time it needs to be properly calculated .",
    "we plan to improve our numerical code in the future .",
    "we expect that this effect will cause a time delay between synchrotron and self - compton fluxes .",

    "we measure the total injected power with the corresponding compactness , defined as @xmath84 : in this case we use @xmath85 .",

    "@xmath3 corresponds to the dimension perpendicular to the jet axis , while the width of the region could correspond to @xmath88 .",
    "besides possibly representing a real situation ( even if highly idealized ) , this case is useful to clearly show the light crossing time effects .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the simulation of a region powered by a shock will be presented in section [ shock ] .    in order to better understand the different behaviours of the evolution of both particle and photons distributions",
    ", we can roughly divide the electron distribution and the emitted synchrotron spectrum into three main energy ranges depending on the characteristic involved time scales , with respect to @xmath1 :    1 .   low energy ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 hz ) , in which the cooling time is at least one order of magnitude longer than @xmath1 , so particle escape is the leading effect ; 2 .",
    "medium energy ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 hz ) , in which the electron cooling time is comparable to @xmath1 , so that the cooling time is comparable to the escape time ; 3 .   high energy ( @xmath93 , @xmath94hz ) in which @xmath95 ( by at least one order of magnitude ) , so that the particle distribution evolves more rapidly than @xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the electron distributions @xmath96 at different times , with high temporal resolution for the first instants , and lower temporal resolution for the rest of the evolution , when the cooling effects are much slower .",
    "the higher energy part of the distribution reaches the equilibrium state in a very short time , and does not vary during the injection time , except for a small decay due to the increasing radiaton field in the source , which increases the particle cooling .",
    "this is shown by the first three distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , labelled according to the time ( in @xmath1 units ) after the beginning of the injection .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the synchrotron self ",
    "compton spectra produced by the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , from @xmath97 to @xmath98 _ without considering light travel time effects_. the first instants ( while the injection is active ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , and the decay in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . at frequencies above the synchrotron peak",
    "the cooling time is short , the equilibrium state is reached quickly and the flux is steady during the injection time , except for the very initial instants , not reproduced in fig .",
    "note that since electrons are injected only at very high energies their emission is first concentrated at high frequencies ; only after some cooling time they can substantially emit at lower frequencies , simulating a new particle injection at lower energies .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , where the flux at @xmath99 hz increases for @xmath100 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the spectra produced by considering the effect of the _ light crossing time _ : as we already emphasized in section [ slices ] this effect must be included when the @xmath96 distribution evolves on time scales shorter than @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the observer will see different emissions coming from different regions of the source , _ as the source itself were not homogeneous_. we stress that this is only due to the photon crossing time . in order to properly calculate the _",
    "observed _ spectral evolution , we have to sum the correct contributions of the different source slices . the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] correspond to the first instants of the evolution .",
    "note that the intensity of synchrotron radiation is now increasing during the injection time also at frequencies above the peak .",
    "this is mainly due to the photon crossing time : when the electron cooling time is very short with respect to @xmath1 ( as it is for example for electrons emitting at the synchrotron peak at @xmath101 hz ) , the equilibrium state is reached quickly , and during the injection the observer receives photons coming from an increasing volume .",
    "after @xmath102 the flux remains steady until @xmath103 , as can be easily seen also in the light curves (  [ glc ] , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this effect is also shown by the compton component .    due to the rapid cooling ,",
    "electrons at the highest energy reach equilibrium in a short time , and during the injection time the distribution at these energies remains steady .",
    "after @xmath104 , it decays very rapidly .",
    "the corresponding synchrotron emission is then ` switched on ' for a short time ( during which it is constant ) and then it is ` switched off ' . at",
    "any given time ( within @xmath1 ) the observer will then see a constant flux , produced by a single ` switched on ' slice ( which is ` running ' across the source ) .",
    "this behaviour can be also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where the light curves at different frequencies are shown .",
    "we can compare the light curves obtained considering or neglecting light crossing time effects .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a and fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , respectively .",
    "we choose three frequencies on the synchrotron component as they are characteristic of the three different energy ranges , and an additional frequency around the ( initial ) compton peak .",
    "[ fig4]a shows that at very low frequencies , ( i.e. @xmath105 hz ) , where @xmath106 , the rise of intensity is slow , because it is mainly controlled by the the light crossing time @xmath1 : the observer will see the first slice , then the first and the second slices , etc . ;",
    "when the last slice become visible , the first one is still emitting , because particle cooling is very slow .",
    "since electrons are injected mainly at high energies , they can substantially emit at lower frequencies only after some cooling time scales : after @xmath103 the intensity is still rising in some slices , causing the flux at these low frequencies to peak at @xmath107 .    the intensity at higher frequencies peaks instead at earlier times .",
    "at very high synchrotron frequencies ( @xmath108 hz and above ) we will have a plateau , because both @xmath0 and @xmath104 are much shorter than @xmath1 : the electrons cool so fast that we will see a single slice ` running ' across the source , as mentioned above .",
    "the shape of the decay phase is different for different frequencies : it is mainly controlled by @xmath9 at very low frequencies ( see the light curve at @xmath109 hz ) , while cooling dominates at higher frequencies .",
    "note that the decay in the low frequency light curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a are very similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , while the entire high frequency light curves and the initial instants of the low frequency ones can not be reproduced without including the light crossing time effect .",
    "this happens because in these last two cases @xmath1 is longer than @xmath0 or the injection time , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we also show the @xmath110 hz light curve , which is close to the ( initail ) peak of the compton emission component .",
    "the shape of this curve is very similar to that of the @xmath111 hz one , which is close to the synchrotron peak , because emission mainly comes from electrons of approximately the same energy .",
    "we now show the case of electrons distributed in energy as a power law @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , continuously injected for @xmath115 .",
    "input parameters for this case are : @xmath81 cm , @xmath116 @xmath6 s@xmath37 with @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath85 , @xmath82 gauss .",
    "we plot the time dependent spectra from @xmath103 to @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a without considering the effect of the slices and in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b we summed the correct contribution of the different slices .",
    "also in this case we roughly divide the synchrotron component into three energy ranges :    1 .   for @xmath120",
    "hz the corresponding electron cooling time is much longer than @xmath1 , and the decay of the flux ( for @xmath100 ) is mainly due to particle escape ; 2 .   for @xmath121",
    "hz we have @xmath122 : this is the part of the emitted spectrum in which we can see the greatest differences between the behaviours reported in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a and [ fig5]b ; in other words , in this range of frequencies it is strictly necessary to take into account the different photon crossing times in order to correctly reproduce the evolution of the emitted spctrum ; 3 .   in the middle region",
    "we have @xmath123 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the flux behaviour , after the stop of the injection , in the spectral region in which @xmath122 : in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ( light crossing time effects ignored ) we see that at the highest synchrotron frequencies the decay is very rapid , since the entire source closely follows the decay of the corresponding electron distribution .    in the second case ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b , taking into account light crossing time effects ) the behaviour is more complex , and after the end of the injection the emission falls showing three different phases :    * @xmath124 : we have a slow decay ; we receive the emission from the distribution that starts to cool from the front slices , while the back slices are still ` switched on ' .",
    "* @xmath125 : when almost the entire source is ( seen ) cooled , the decay speeds up , because the only important contributions are given by the back slices , * @xmath126 : the entire source will not contain highly energetic electrons any longer , and the emission at @xmath127 hz is dominated by the compton component , produced by electrons of relatively small energy , whose cooling time is long .",
    "correspondingly , at these frequencies the decay is again slow .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated by the light curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    for the flux at the highest ( compton ) frequencies ,",
    "the behaviour is similar to the synchrotron flux , up to @xmath128 , after which the flux disappears .",
    "it is important to note that just after the end of the injection , when high energy electrons are present and synchrotron photons are scattered at @xmath129 hz , we find similar variability factors for frequencies above the two peaks , contrary to the ` normal ' behaviour which is characterized by a quadratic dependence of the compton flux with respect to the synchrotron flux .",
    "this is due to the fact that the compton scattering at these frequencies is in the klein nishina regime : high energy electrons efficiently scatter seed photons of frequencies @xmath130 ( see equation 16 ) . for the highest energy electrons",
    "the available synchrotron photons for scattering are less , reducing the variability amplitude ( see e.g. ghisellini , maraschi & dondi 1996 ) .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a and [ fig6]b the light curves at four different frequencies considering or not light crossing time effects .",
    "we can see that taking them into account we can have symmetric light curves , with equal rising and decaying phases , at frequencies for which @xmath122 .",
    "the cooling time of the electrons emitting at high frequencies ( @xmath131 hz ) is much shorter than @xmath1 , and the electron distribution remains steady for the entire injection time .",
    "this implies that for @xmath132 the observer sees an increase of the flux due to the increasing ` switched on ' volume of the source .",
    "after @xmath103 , the front slices ` switch off ' , and the total flux decreases .",
    "this corresponds to symmetric light curves without plateaux . at lower frequencies ,",
    "at which @xmath133 , the decay is slower than the rise , and the light curves are asymmetric .",
    "another remarkable effect is the existence of time - lags among the light curves at different frequencies : it is easy to note that the emission peaks are not reached at the same time and the flux at the highest frequencies appear to lead .    all these behaviours are not observable if we do not take into account the light crossing time : in this case we see the formation of a plateau at high frequencies , where the equilibrium state is reached first . furthermore we can not observe time lags between different frequencies , because when the injection stops , the intensity begins to fall at all frequencies , although with different decay shapes ( steeper at higher frequencies ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a we can observe the changes in the slope of the decay of the @xmath134 hz light curve , according to what discussed in sect . 3.2 .",
    "we have already noticed the existence of time - lags among light curves at different frequencies , that are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a : this is a consequence of taking into account the light crossing time effects , although time delays are mainly caused by the different cooling times of electrons emitting at different frequencies .",
    "assume in fact that @xmath112 : at @xmath102 the observer sees the stop of the particle injection in the ` front ' of the source , while the back of the source is still ` switched off ' ; in other words , at this time the observer is receiving the spectra emitted by a population of electrons at @xmath135 ( from the front of the source ) and at @xmath136 ( from the back of the source ) . at later times in the front of the source",
    "the electron distribution starts to decay ( with a corresponding decay of the emitted flux ) , while in the back the flux is still rising until the particle distribution reaches , after some @xmath0 , the equilibrium state .",
    "this combination of slices in which the emitted flux is increasing and slices in which the decaying phase is already started , determines the position of the peak on each light curve .",
    "notice that if the electron cooling time is very short ( for example in the case of the @xmath137 hz in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , the equilibrium state is reached in a very short time with respect to @xmath1 : after the injection stops , each slice is quickly _ turned off _ , and the peak of the light curve is reached soon after @xmath138 . in light curves corresponding to lower energy electrons",
    "the peak will occour later , because the equilibrium state is reached later : after the stop of the injection the flux is slowly decreasing in the front of the source , while it is still increasing in the back .",
    "the longer the particle cooling time , the longer the time that the light curve needs to reach the maximum .",
    "we emphasize that the different cooling times of the electrons responsible for the emission at different frequencies introduce more visible time  lags if the light crossing time effects are included , as can be seen comparing the light curves for the high synchrotron frequencies shown in fig .",
    "6a and fig . 6b .",
    "we assume that a shock of longitudinal dimension @xmath3 and width @xmath139 runs along a region of the jet of same dimension @xmath3 ( perpendicular to the jet axis ) .",
    "particle flows along the jet with a velocity @xmath140 . in the frame comoving with this flow the shock moves with a velocity @xmath141 . as in the previous sections , we assume that the observer is located at an angle @xmath142 from the jet axis , such that the viewing angle in the comoving frame is @xmath143 .",

    "[ jet ] an illustrative example with a small number of different regions . in this case , each slice parallel to the jet axis is characterized by different electron distributions : ` young ' electrons close to the shock front , and older ones far from it .",
    "it is therefore necessary to subdivide each slice into an appropriate number of ` cells ' ( see fig .",
    "[ jet ] ) .",
    "the velocity of the shock in the frame comoving with the particle flow determines the size of the cells in the direction parallel to the jet axis , and then the total emitting volume .",

    "8b one can notice that in the shock case we obtain further delays between different frequencies , due to the different way of summing the spectra produced at different timesteps . from these simulations",
    "we can conclude that there are no qualitative differencies between the light curves in the ` homogeneous ' case with @xmath149 , except for the occurrence of further time delays between light curves at different frequencies .      in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a we show the light curves resulting from discontinuously injecting a gaussian distribution of particles , centered at @xmath83 . in the shown case",

    "at which @xmath133 , the electron distribution builds up , since electrons cool in a time scale longer than the time separation between different injection phases .",
    "this introduces both a smoothing of the corresponding light curve and a time delay with respect to higher frequency light curves .",

    "we summarize here the main characteristic of the light curves for different values of @xmath104 , @xmath0 and @xmath9 :    * @xmath158 * * when @xmath159 we see a slow rise of intensity , mainly controlled by the light crossing time @xmath1 : the maximum of intensity is reached for @xmath107 , and depends on @xmath0 and @xmath9 . at small frequencies , where @xmath160 , the decay of the emission is controlled by @xmath9 , while at frequencies where @xmath161 the leading effect is cooling ; * * when @xmath162 the rising shape of the light curve is similar to the above case .",
    "the maximum of intensity is now reached at @xmath163 , and the shape of the decay is controlled by @xmath0 ; in the special case in which @xmath164 some @xmath0 we have a symmetric light curve ; * * if @xmath165 we have a fast rise of intensity ( @xmath166 ) and then a plateau ( or a very slow rise in the shock case ) until @xmath163 . for @xmath107",
    "the decay is as fast as the initial rise .",
    "* @xmath115 * * if @xmath106 we see a slow rise , the maximum is at @xmath167 , and the decay is due to escape if @xmath160 ; * * if @xmath168 the shapes of the rising and decaying phases are very similar , resulting in a symmetric light curve ; * * where @xmath95 both the rise and the decay are controlled by the light crossing time , and we have symmetric light curves with time lags depending on the different cooling times ; * if @xmath104 is much longer than @xmath1 and @xmath0 the light curve will have a plateau , because the long injection time allows the entire source to reach equilibrium .    the main difference between injecting electrons at high energies ( ` monoenergetic ' or gaussian injection ) and injecting a power  law ( with @xmath114 ) distribution is that in the first case the emission will be concentrated first at high frequencies , and only after some @xmath0 electrons can substantially emit at lower frequencies .",
    "this simulates a sort of a ` new ' injection at low energies , that continues for @xmath100 , and produces a time delay between the peak of the emission at different frequencies .",
    "if the emitting plasma has bulk motion , we must take into account the effects of beaming . if @xmath78 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath169 the viewing angle and @xmath170^{-1}$ ] the beaming factor , the observed intensity is @xmath171 and @xmath172 , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the comoving intensity and comoving time scales , respectively .",
    "observations of variability in bl lac objects suggest the simultaneous presence of different variability time scales on each source ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1997 , massaro et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggesting that the variations can be originated by more than one component : a larger one can take into account of the longer time scale variations , and smaller ones can originate the rapid flares .",
    "flares are observed at almost all wavelengths ( depending on each source characteristics ) , and can have different durations ( from hours to days ) .",
    "the occurrence of outbursts with symmetric shape ( similar rise and fall ) have been recently reported for well monitored sources , especially in the optical band ( massaro et al .",
    "1996 , ghisellini et al . 1997 ) and in the x  ray band ( urry et al . 1997 ) .",

    "@xmath115 and @xmath122 .    in case ( i )",
    "symmetric light curves are present only within a very small range of frequencies ( @xmath123 ) , while in case ( ii ) quasi  symmetric light curves can occur at all frequencies corresponding to particle cooling time scales shorter than @xmath1 . furthermore the second case can be interpreted as a result of a shock lasting for a time @xmath115 .",
    "note that the underlying component has not been included in the previous simulations (   [ gauss ] and [ pl ] ) , which only describe the evolution of the ` flaring ' component . to correctly reproduce the blazars variability behaviour ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to take into account the presence of a quasi - stationary component , _ diluting _ the variability of the flaring component .",
    "finally , note that the simulations in  3.4 of a shock active for a time @xmath1 are similar to the corresponding ` homogenous ' case , with slightly longer time delays between light curves at different frequencies .",
    "mkn 421 is one of the nearest bl lac lac objects ( @xmath176 ) and it is classified as xbl ( x  ray selected bl lac ) ( giommi et al .",

    "described in the previous sections we can qualitatively reproduce this behaviour , first by fitting the high and the low states ( macomb et al .",
    "1995 ) as equilibrium ssc spectra , and then by generating simulated light curves at all frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ mkn_hl ] we report the simultaneous spectra taken during the high and low states ( data from macomb et al . 1995 , 1996 , using @xmath183 km",

    "the parameters used for the fits are reported in the figure caption .",
    "we assumed that the rapid variability revealed by asca during the highly active x  ray / tev state is due to the sum of a rapidly evolving component and a quasi - constant one , corresponding to the high state fit .",
    "we add to this constant emission a variable component , for which we found the following parameters :    @xmath185 cm , @xmath186 gauss , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 between @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "we perform the simulation in the shock case with the following parameters : @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "we plot the obtained light curves at four different frequencies in fig .",
    "[ mkn_lc ] .",
    "note that the flux is still increasing at all reported frequencies for @xmath195 , which corresponds to @xmath196 hours : this is due to the different evolving state of the electrons in the different cells .",
    "because of the photons travel time , when the injection stops ( at @xmath197 ) the observer still sees the emission from the back of the source produced by the @xmath198 particle distribution .",
    "therefore the maximum flux is observed at a time greater than @xmath1 , by an amount depending on the cooling time : the flux at the highest frequencies peaks first , followed by the flux at lower frequencies . as a consequence ,",
    "the flux at the synchrotron peak ( x  ray band ) leads the flux at lower frequencies , and time - lags can be observed even between close frequencies within the same band .",
    "another consequence of our modelling is the prediction of time - lags between the synchrotron and the self - compton fluxes .",
    "while the x  ray and the tev emission are probably produced by the same electrons , the most effective seed photons for the tev emission are in the ( observed ) optical  uv band , due to the klein nishina decline of the scattering cross section . in the case",
    "discussed here , the electron population producing the optical  uv emission builds up , as a consequence of particle cooling , some time after the beginning of the injection .",
    "uv and tev emissions should therefore be nearly simultaneous , lagging the x  ray emission .",
    "a delay between x  ray and tev emission can also be introduced by taking into account the different light travel times of the seed photons to be scattered at high energies , as mentioned in  2.3 , but to be more quantitative we must await a more detailed numerical treatment . a time lag between x  ray and tev fluxes should exist only if the seed photons for the scattering are produced locally . in the alternative case of seed photons coming from external regions ( by , e.g. a dusty ir torus ) , we expect to observe a simultaneous rise in the x  ray and tev fluxes of the same factor .",
    "note that the ` external ' radiation could also come from adiacent regions of the flaring component , i.e. the ones responsible for the ` diluting ' component .",
    "also in this case the x  ray and the tev fluxes , being produced by the same electrons , should vary linearly and simultaneously .",
    "by summing the contribution of different slices of the source , the observer receives photons produced by particle distributions of different ages , a situation which resembles the one occuring in an inhomogeneous source .",
    "this effect is important whenever the particle distribution evolves on time scales shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "despite the fact that this effect tends to smooth out fast variations , time delays between light curves at different frequencies are observable , as illustrated for the hard / soft x  ray emission of mkn 421 .",
    "our results are particularly important for the observed fast variability of blazars , where the variability time scales indicate extremely compact emission regions , thus large magnetic and radiation energy densities , and consequently cooling time scales shorter than the light crossing time @xmath1 .",
    "this is also a necessary condition for having symmetrical flares ( equal rising and decay time scales ) , often observed in the optical and in the x  ray band .",
    "note that the case of 3c 279 , one of the best studied blazars which showed asymmetric light curves at high energies , is probably different , because the high energy emission can be inverse compton scattering off seed photons produced externally to the jet , and the resulting light curve can be connected to the geometrical distribution of these seed photons : for example , if an active blob passes through the broad line region ( blr ) , there will be enhanced inverse compton emission as long as the blob is inside the blr , and a sudden drop when the blob moves outside the blr .    within the synchrotron self ",
    "compton scenario , the symmetrical behaviour of the light curves near or above the peak of the synchrotron emission can be contrasted with the light curves at lower frequencies , characterized by cooling ( and escape ) time scales longer than @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the light curves should be asymmetric , with a rising phase lasting @xmath199 ( if @xmath115 ) , and a decaying phase lasting for @xmath0 ( or @xmath9 , if shorter than @xmath0 ) .",
    "sources with different magnetic field and/or different compactnesses should behave differently , since for large compactness ( or larger magnetic field ) sources , the cooling time can be shorter than @xmath1 for a wider range of electron energies , resulting in symmetric light curves for a wider range of frequencies .",
    "we stress that symmetric light curves without plateaux strongly constrain the injection and the cooling time scales : if both these times are much longer than the the light crossing time @xmath1 the light curve is not symmetric ; if both time scales are much shorter than @xmath1 the curve is symmetric , but a plateau forms , while if the injection time is shorter than @xmath1 and the cooling time is of the same order , a symmetric light curve is possible ( without plateau ) , but only at one specific frequency .",
    "therefore symmetric light curves without plateau at more than one frequency are possible only if the the injection last for @xmath1 and the cooling time is shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "a more complex behaviour is possible if the injection of relativistic electrons is impulsive and repeated several times within one light crossing time @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the synchrotron flux at the largest frequencies responds to the different injection phases , and the repeated injections can make the plateaux in their light curve to disappear .",
    "variations of relatively small amplitude are possible in very short times , which would lead to calculate variability time scales shorter than @xmath1 . at lower frequencies , where cooling times are longer , the electron distributions corresponding to different injections can build up and the memory of the individual injection phases is lost . at these frequencies the light curves are smoother , and they can have apparent delays ( with respect to higher frequency light curves ) produced by this ` build up ' effect .",
