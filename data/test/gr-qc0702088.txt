    "at the beginning of the 20th century h. poincar convincingly showed that there is no sense to assert that one or other geometry of physical space is a true .",
    "only the aggregate `` geometry + measuring instruments '' has a physical , verifiable by experience sense .",
    "a. einstein recognised the justice of poincar s reasons .",
    "his theory of gravity does not reject poincar s ideas .",
    "it only demonstrates relativity of space and time with respect to distribution of matter .",
    "poincar s ideas indicate to another property of physical reality - relativity of the geometrical properties with respect to measuring instruments , dependency on their properties .",
    "these ideas , apparently , have never been realized in physics and remain until now , more likely , by a subject for discussions of philosophers .",
    "the success of general relativity almost convinced us that physical space - time in the presence of matter is riemannian and that this fact does not depend on properties of the measuring instruments .",
    "the attempts to describe gravity in flat space - time did not obtain recognition and poincar s ideas proved to be almost forgotten for physics .",
    "however , are poincar s ideas really only a thing of such little use as conventionalism , as it is usually believed ?",
    "a choice of certain properties of measuring instruments is nothing but the choice of some frame of reference , which is just such a physical device by means of which we test properties of space - time .",
    "( of course , we must understand a distinction between a frame of reference as a physical device , and a coordinate system as only a means of parameterisation of events in space - time ) .",
    "for this reason poincar s reasoning about interdependency between properties of space - time and measuring instruments should be understood as the existence of a connection between geometry of space - time and properties of the frame of reference being used .",
    "@xcite    the existence of such a connection can be shown by an analysis of a simple and well - known example . disregarding the rotation of the earth we can consider a reference frame , rigidly connected with the earth surface , as the inertial one ( ifr ) .",
    "an observer , who is located in this frame of reference , can , without coming into conflict with experience , describe the motion of a test particle as the one in minkowski space - time , under the action of a certain force field @xmath1 .",
    "consider now an observer , who is located in a frame of reference , the reference body of which formed by identical dot masses , free falling in the field @xmath1 .",
    "such a reference frame can be named the proper frame of reference ( pfr ) for the given field .",
    "assume , the observer is deprived of the possibility to see the earth and stars .",
    "this observer does not feel the presence of force field @xmath1 in any place of the frame .",
    "therefore , if he proceeds from relativity of space - time in berkeley - leibnitz - mach- poincar ( blmp ) meaning , then from his viewpoint the accelerations of the dot masses , forming the reference body of his frame , in his physical space must be equal to zero .",
    "however , instead , he observes a change in the distances between these dot masses in time .",
    "how can he explain this fact ? evidently , only reasonable explanation for him is the interpretation of this observed phenomenon as a manifestation of the deviation of geodetic lines in a riemannian space of nonzero curvature .",
    "thus , if an observer in the ifr postulates that space - time is flat , then the observer in a proper reference frames of the force field @xmath1 , who proceeds from relativity of space and time in the blmp meaning , _ is forced _ to consider it as riemannian .",
    "we accept according to the special relativity that space - time in ifrs is pseudo - euclidean .",
    "however can be argued @xcite that if we proceed from relativity of space - time in the blmp sense , then the differential metric form of space - time in pfrs is of the form @xmath2 in this equation @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the lagrange function describing in an ifr the motion of identical dot masses @xmath5 , forming the reference body of the pfr .",
    "thus , the properties of the space - time in a pfr are defined by properties of the used frame in accordance with the poincar idea .    in order to describe gravitation in inertial and proper frames of reference",
    "we suppose @xcite that in pseudo- euclidean space - time gravitation can be described as a tensor field @xmath6 of spin 2 , and the lagrangian , describing the motion of a test particle with the mass @xmath5 , is given by the form @xmath7^{1/2 } ,   \\label{lagrangianthirr}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a symmetric tensor whose components are functions of @xmath10 .",
    "if particles move under influence of the force field @xmath6 , then according to ( [ vr_5/4 ] ) the space - time metric differential form in pfrs of this field takes the form @xmath11 therefore , the space - time in the pfrs is riemannian with curvature other than zero .",
    "the tensor @xmath12 is a space - time metric tensor in pfrs .",
    "any gauge transformation @xmath13 of the unknown tensor field @xmath14 induces some mapping @xmath15 of riemannian space - time which are not related with coordinate transformations . to ensure the invariance of the equations of the motion of test particles with respect to such mappings , correct",
    "differential equations for finding tensor field @xmath16 must be invariant with respect to geodesic mappings of rimmanian s space - time .",
    "these transformation play role of gauge transformation in the theory under consideration .",
    "the simplest geodesic - invariant generalisation of the vacuum einstein equations are : @xmath17    these equations are vacuum bimetric differential equations for the tensor @xmath18 ( greek indices run from 0 to 3 ) , where @xmath19   , \\label{thomases}%\\]]@xmath20 , \\label{thomases0}%\\ ] ] @xmath21 are the christoffel symbols of the minkowski space - time , @xmath22 are the christoffel symbols of the riemannian space - time , whose fundamental tensor is @xmath9 .",

    "the additional conditions are covariant and do not impose any restrictions on the coordinate system selection .    the spherically- symmetric solution of these equations in minkowski space - time have no an event horizon and physical singularity in the centre @xcite .",

    "[ grforce ] that the gravitational force in flat space - time acting on free moving particles essentially differs from that acting on the particles at rest .",

    "two conclusions can be made from this figure.1 . at some distance from the observer",
    "the relative acceleration changes its sign .",
    "if the @xmath104 , the radial acceleration of particles is negative . if @xmath105 , the acceleration is positive .",
    "hence , for sufficiently large distances the gravitational force affecting particles is repulsive and gives rise to a relative acceleration of particles .",
    "the gravitational force , affecting the particles , tends to zero when @xmath93 tends to infinity .",
    "( the same fact takes place as regards the force acting on particles in the case of a static matter . )",
    "the reason of the fact is that at a sufficiently large distance @xmath93 from the observer the schwarzschild radius of the matter inside the sphere of the radius @xmath93 become of the same order as its radius . approximately at @xmath106 the gravitational force begin to decrease .",
    "the ratio @xmath107 tends to zero when @xmath93 tends to infinity , and under the circumstances the gravitational force in the theory under consideration tends to zero .",
    "the above ball can be consedered as a part of a flat accelerating universe . to calculate the velocity of a particle at the distance @xmath93 from the observer",
    "there is no necessity to demand a global spherical symmetry of matter outside of the sphere due to the second properties of the gravitational force , because the gravitational influence of very distant matter is neglected small .",
    "therefore a relative velocity of particles at the distance @xmath93 from the observer is determined by gravitational field of the matter inside of the sphere of the radius @xmath93 .",
