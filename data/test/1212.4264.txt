    "the @xmath2 field is much less mature than the snia one , and there might be some as yet undetected @xmath2 systematic errors that could broaden the @xmath2 error bars , as has happened in the snia case .",
    "however , we emphasize that the observers have done a careful analysis and the error bars we have used in our analysis have been carefully estimated .",
    "in addition to providing more restrictive constraints , the @xmath2 data alone requires accelerated cosmological expansion at the current epoch at approximately 2 @xmath3 confidence level , depending on model and @xmath22 prior used in the analysis .    in summary , the results of the joint analysis of the @xmath2 , bao , and snia data are quite consistent with the predictions of the standard spatially - flat @xmath4cdm cosmological model , with current energy budget dominated by a time - independent cosmological constant .",
    "however , currently - available data can not rule out slowly - evolving dark energy density .",
    "we anticipate that soon to be available better quality data will more clearly discriminate between constant and slowly - evolving dark energy density ."
