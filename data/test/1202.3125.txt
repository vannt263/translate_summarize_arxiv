    "the evolution of thermal plasmas in supernova remnants ( snrs ) is a dynamical time - sequence of shock - heated gas . at first",
    ", a large fraction of the expanding velocity is converted to random velocity ( thermal energy ) .",
    "the shock - heated temperature is proportional to the mass of the plasma particles ( electrons and ions ) ; the ion temperature is more than 1000 times higher than the electron temperature ( hereafter , @xmath1 ) .",
    "subsequently , the energy of ions is transferred to the electrons , and hence @xmath1 gradually increases .",
    "then the high temperature electrons slowly ionize the ions to higher ionization states . here",
    "we define the ionization temperature ( @xmath2 ) as a parameter to represent populations of ionization states ; @xmath2 is equal to the plasma temperature in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) , which realizes the observed populations of ionization states .",
    "the typical timescale of ionization in snr plasmas ( density is @xmath3  @xmath4 ) is @xmath5  s ( @xcite ) . accordingly , most of the young - intermediate snrs have lower @xmath2 than @xmath1 , which is called an under - ionized or ionizing plasma , because ionization dominates over recombination .",
    "in fact , young  middle - aged shell - like snrs have been generally described with an ionizing plasma model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , suzaku has discovered strong radiative recombination continua ( rrcs ) in the x - ray spectra of three snrs , ic443 , w49b , and g359.1@xmath60.5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the strong rrcs appear when recombination dominates over ionization ( recombining plasma ) .",
    "in fact , the x - ray spectra of these snrs can be fit by neither cie plasma , ionizing plasma , nor any combination of them .",
    "detailed spectroscopic analysis with the recombining plasma code revealed that @xmath2 are 1.53 times higher than @xmath1 .",
    "these snrs have some common features .",
    "( 1 )  all are categorized into mixed - morphology snrs ( mm  snrs : @xcite ) , which have a radio shell with centrally - filled thermal x - rays .",
    "( 2 )  these are associated with shocked molecular clouds and gev / tev @xmath7-ray emissions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    w28 ( g6.4@xmath60.1 ) , a bright mm  snr , exhibits above two conditions ; a shock interaction with the ambient gas indicated by the expanding h shell ( @xcite ) , broad co , cs , and h@xmath8 emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers ( @xcite ) . also gev and tev",
    "@xmath7-rays were detected ( @xcite ; ) .    from the estimated distance of 1.9@xmath90.3  kpc ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the angular size of @xmath10 is @xmath1030  pc .",
    "the large size , possible association to the nearby pulsar ( @xcite ) , and dynamical evolution of the h shell ( @xcite ) constrain the age of w28 to be 33,000150,000  yr .    rosat and asca mapped the entire remnant in the x - ray band ( @xcite ) and found center - filled structure with partial shells at northeast and southwest .",
    "the x - ray spectrum in the central region had hard x - ray emissions up to @xmath11  kev with the iron ( fe ) k@xmath0 line , and was fit with a two - temperature plasma of @xmath12  kev and @xmath13  kev in cie or ionizing .",
    "thus no hint of recombining plasma has been reported from w28 , although this snr shares the common features with the three snrs of recombining plasmas .",
    "the aim of this paper is to search for and quantitatively study recombining plasmas with the superior energy resolution and the large effective area of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) onboard suzaku ( @xcite ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "the distance of 2  kpc is adopted and statistical errors are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "we observed the central bright region of w28 with the xis as a part of the recombining plasma survey project ( pi : koyama , k. ) .",
    "the local background was obtained from the suzaku archive near w28 .",
    "the locations of the two fields and the observation log are respectively shown in figure  [ fig : rass ] and in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the xis consists of four ccd cameras each placed at the focal planes of four x - ray telescopes ( xrts : @xcite ) .",
    "three sensors employ front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) , while the other employs a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd ( xis1 ) .",
    "the entire region of xis2 and one of the edge region of xis0 have not been functional since anomalies in 2006 november and in 2009 june , respectively .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of the xis combined with xrt covers a @xmath14 region with the pixel scale of  pixel@xmath15 .",
    "the angular resolution of  in the half - power diameter is almost independent of photon energies and off - axis angles within @xmath10 10% .",
    "the total effective area of the operational xis0 , 1 , and 3 combined with the three xrts is 1070  @xmath16 at 1.5  kev . due to the low orbital altitude of suzaku at @xmath10550  km",
    ", the xis achieves a low and stable background environment .",
    "the xis observation was made with the normal clocking mode . the software package heasoft version 6.11 and the pipeline processing version 2.4 were used for the data reduction . to restore the radiation - induced degradation in the energy gain and resolution , the spaced - row charge injection technique ( sci : @xcite )",
    "was applied with the makepi files version 20110621 provided by the xis team ( @xcite ) .",
    "then the systematic uncertainty in the energy scale is @xmath17 10  ev at 5.9  kev .",
    "we removed hot and flickering pixels , and events during the south atlantic anomaly passages and in the earth night - time and day - time elevation angles below and , respectively .",
    "( 80mm,90mm)figure2.eps    ( 80mm,30mm)figure3.eps      figure  [ fig : xisimg ] shows the x - ray images of the w28 center and the nearby - sky fields .",
    "the non  x - ray background ( nxb ) generated by xisnxbgen ( @xcite ) was subtracted , and then the vignetting and exposure corrections were made .",
    "we can see excess emission from w28 in the soft x - ray band , but no excess in the hard band ( figure  [ fig : xisimg ] ) .",
    "we extracted the source and background spectra from the solid and dashed circles in figure  [ fig : xisimg ] , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig:3spec ] , where the effective area of the background is normalized to that of the source region .",
    "compared with the background , the source spectrum shows obvious excess below @xmath18  kev but no excess in the hard x - ray band @xmath19  kev ( figure  [ fig:3spec ] ) , consistent with the images .",
    "this result is , however , inconsistent with the previous asca observations , which claimed the detection of hard x - ray emission up to @xmath11  kev with the fe k@xmath0 line ( @xcite ) .",
    "one problem is position - to - position fluctuations of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "we therefore estimated the cxb flux assuming the photon index , the average surface brightness , and the galactic absorption to be 1.412 , 6.38@xmath20  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath15  sr@xmath15 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath22  h  @xmath21 ( ) , respectively .",
    "then the expected cxb level ( the gray curve in figure  [ fig:3spec ] ) is only about 5% of the total background flux .",
    "thus the error due to the cxb fluctuation can be neglected .",
    "the major source of the background is the galactic diffuse x - ray emission ( gdxe ) because w28 is located near the galactic plane and the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "in fact , the fe k@xmath0 line at 6.7  kev seen in figure  [ fig:3spec ] is due to the gdxe . since the surface brightness of the gdxe quickly decreases with the increasing distance from the galactic plane with the scale height of @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , we selected the background region from the same galactic latitude ( figure  [ fig : xisimg ] left ) of w28 ( figure  [ fig : xisimg ] right ) .",
    "the gdxe uncertainty is , therefore , due to the longitude distribution along the plane .",
    "the flux of the gdxe decreases as the distance from the gc increases with the scale length of @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then the gdxe on the background region is estimated to be about 5% smaller than that on w28 .",
    "still we found no excess from w28 above the background in the hard x - ray band , and hence no hard x - ray emission above 5  kev for w28 is very conservative conclusion .",
    "( 140mm,220mm)figure4.eps      we subtracted the background spectrum ( the red data in figure  [ fig:3spec ] ) from the source spectrum ( the blue data in figure  [ fig:3spec ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "we can see many k - shell emission lines from highly ionized neon ( ne ) , magnesium ( mg ) , silicon ( si ) , and sulfur ( s ) as well as l - shell emission lines from fe .",

    "this revised picture comes from the absence of the high energy photons above @xmath18  kev in the suzaku spectrum , which would be due to proper background subtraction ( subsection  [ sec : bgdsub ] ) . to improve the value of @xmath43d.o.f . , we added further cie components , but found no significant improvement .",
    "the most remarkable residuals in any cie model are line - like excess at the si lyman@xmath0 energy ( 2.0  kev ) and bump - like structures at 2.45.0  kev .",
    "the bumps at 2.45.0  kev have two rising edges at 2.4 and 3.2  kev , which are most probably due to rrcs of he - like si and s , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "together with the strong si lyman@xmath0 residual , the spectrum is due to a recombining plasma , at least for si and s. we thus tried a recombining plasma model in the rrc band of si and s ( 1.75.0  kev ) .",

    "the free parameters were abundances of ne , mg , si , s , and fe , and @xmath23 .",
    "the result is , however , unacceptable with @xmath43d.o.f . of 6914/642 ( figure  [ fig : spec]c ) .",
    "as shown by the solid arrows in figure  [ fig : spec]c , remarkable excess are found at the k@xmath0 lines of he - like mg ( 1.35  kev ) and ne ( 0.92  kev ) and the fe l - shell complex at @xmath100.8  kev .",

    "the recombining plasmas in snrs are not expected in the standard scenario , and hence there must be a missing branch of evolution of snrs .",
    "several ideas have been proposed , such as rapid electron cooling by adiabatic rarefaction ( @xcite ) , or conduction cooling by ambient cold matter ( @xcite ) , extra - ionization by high - energy photons ( @xcite ) or by supra - thermal particles ( @xcite ) , and so on .",
    "any scenario may compose of two processes ; ( 1 ) initial process to make a plasma of higher @xmath2 than @xmath1 , and ( 2 ) gradual relaxation of the recombining plasma toward cie .",
    "we propose that the process ( 2 ) carries the essential roll to make element - dependent @xmath2 .",
    "based on the simulation of the @xmath2 relaxation in time and comparison with the observed multi-@xmath2 values , possible origin of the recombining plasma from w28 is discussed in the following subsections .",
    "difference of @xmath2 among elements can appear in a relaxation epoch of recombining plasma to cie because the relaxation timescale is different from element to element .",
    "numerical studies have demonstrated that the relaxation timescale basically shows monotonic increase with atomic number , except for fe and ni ( e.g. , see figure  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "these two heavy elements have shorter timescales than the other lighter elements at @xmath2 from sub to a few  kev , because the l - shell processes are dominant for fe and ni , while the k - shell processes are dominant for the others in this temperature range .",
    "the observed @xmath2 values appear to satisfy this trend ( table  [ tab : mtzfit ] ) .    to examine whether the difference in recombination timescale can quantitatively explain the observed @xmath2",
    ", we simulate time evolutions of @xmath2 in a recombining plasma by using the neij model in spex .",
    "the parameters are the initial ionization temperature @xmath67 , @xmath1 , and the recombination time @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the density of electrons and the elapsed time , respectively .",
    "we have tried many sets of ( @xmath67 , @xmath70 ) for fixed @xmath1 of 0.4  kev following the best - fit value ( table  [ tab : mtzfit ] ) .",
    "we obtained similar best - fit @xmath2 distribution from different parameter set of ( @xmath67 , @xmath70 ) .",
    "we therefore constrain the parameter set within physically reasonable values",
    ". one plausible case of @xmath71  kev is given in figure  [ fig : plasim]a , which shows the simulated decrease of @xmath2 with time ( @xmath68 ) .",

    "the simulated @xmath2 values after @xmath73  s  @xmath4 , is close to the observation with @xmath43d.o.f . of @xmath74 .",
    "we caution that the @xmath43d.o.f .",
    "value is just for reference to compare a more complex simulation given in the next subsection , and should not be taken seriously , because the major uncertainty of the observed @xmath2 is not statistic error but systematic one due to incomplete modeling and/or atomic data in the analyses .      in a more general case",
    ", initial @xmath67 should be different among elements .",
    "we hence simulate the time evolution of @xmath2 in this case .",
    "the simulation consists of two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we simulate the evolution of @xmath2 in an ionizing plasma .",
    "this gives the element - dependent @xmath67 . then using this result , we simulate a recombining plasma as was done in the previous subsection .",
    "the parameters are the electron temperature during the ionizing phase @xmath75 , the ionization time @xmath76 , and the recombination time @xmath68 .",
    "the electron temperatures during the two processes , @xmath75 and @xmath1 , are assumed to be 10  kev and 0.4  kev , respectively .    in figure",
    "[ fig : plasim]b , we plot decrease of @xmath2 during the recombining phase for the case of @xmath77  kev and @xmath78  s  @xmath4 .",
    "this combined process gives a better fit to the observed @xmath2 , than that of the single relaxation process of recombining plasma ( see subsection  [ sec : rec ] ) at @xmath79  s  @xmath4 with @xmath43d.o.f .",
    "of @xmath80 .",
    "one may argue that other combinations of the parameter values may also work as well .",
    "as we already noted , many combinations were examined and the recombination times are always found to be @xmath1010@xmath81  s  @xmath4 or longer .",
    "thus , the result of @xmath68 does not depend much on the initial conditions of @xmath67 .",
    "we have shown that the combination of the processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) provides a plausible scenario for producing the observed spectrum with the initial conditions given in figure 5(b ) ( see the beginning of discussion and section 4.1 ) .",
    "the initial conditions can be set by collisional ionization in thermal pool of electrons with no special ionization process such as photo - ionization or supra - thermal electrons .",
    "this supports the electron cooling scenario for w28 . in the simulation",
    ", @xmath68 is @xmath82 , which corresponds to @xmath83  yr , roughly consistent with the age of w28 .",
    "thus , the recombination time is consistent with the rarefaction scenario ( @xcite ) .",
    "this recombination time is also nearly the same order of the cooling timescale by thermal conduction , which is estimated to be @xmath102@xmath1410@xmath84  yr for the plasma of 6-pc diameter ( see equation  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we found no spatial correlation of the recombining plasma to the molecular clouds ( sawada et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) , which may not favor the thermal conduction scenario .",
    "we therefore propose the rarefaction scenario ( @xcite ) , and discuss along this scenario in the following paragraphs .",
    "more quantitative comparison of these two models will be given in the next paper using the results of spatial distribution of the recombining plasma ( sawada et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "the initial event of the rarefaction scenario would be a type - ii supernova explosion in dense circum - stellar medium ( csm ) made by stellar winds from the massive progenitor . assuming a spherical plasma with the diameter of 6  pc , the mass of the x - ray emitting gas in the center region is estimated to be @xmath105  @xmath85 .",
    "this value is similar to that of a massive progenitor , and hence provides further circumstantial support for the rarefaction scenario .",
    "the shock - heated ejecta and csm experience rapid electron cooling due to adiabatic expansion after shock break - out to the rarefied ambient ism .",
    "the break - out and hence the cooling , occur at the early phase of the snr evolution ( about several 10100  yr after the explosion ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus most of the life would be in the relaxation phase of the recombining plasma , consistent with the large @xmath68 values obtained in our simulations .",
    "due to the dense environment of csm , the shocked gas quickly reaches a temperature of several  kev before the break - out , in good agreement with the @xmath67 values assumed in our simulations .",
    "@xcite extended the previous calculation of @xcite to non - symmetric cases and found that center - filled x - ray morphologies are realized with anisotropic csm due to the rotation of a progenitor star .",
    "the size of the x - ray emitting plasma is about a few 10  pc , which is consistent with that of w28 .",
    "therefore , this scenario can explain both the spectral and spatial structures of the x - ray emission from w28 .",
