    "the cfh12k ccd was taken off and re - installed on the prime focus for each run , and the camera was not at the identical position after each re - installation .",
    "hence , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images are rotated slightly relative to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images for the same field .",
    "the telescope pointing is also not identical . to deal with these problems ,",
    "we match the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images to the @xmath1 image before performing photometry .",
    "because we did not dither to make one large image per pointing , we match the images chip by chip .",
    "the transformation function between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images and the @xmath1 images can be easily determined from bright reference objects .",
    "however , the new transformed coordinates for each pixel are almost always not integer numbers after applying the transformation function with non - integer shifts and rotation",
    ". therefore re - sampling is needed .",
    "to avoid degradation of the image quality and to preserve the poisson characteristics of the photon noise in the images , we use the nearest neighbor re - sampling algorithm , which also preserves flux .",
    "we use the closest integer coordinate of the transformed non - integer coordinate as the new coordinate for each original pixel .",
    "however , two original pixels may produce two transformed non - integer coordinates which may have the same nearest integer coordinate . in other words , one new pixel may be assigned fluxes from two original pixels because of round off in the pixel coordinates .",
    "in addition , some new coordinates may have zero flux because they are not the nearest coordinates for any original pixels .",
    "the photometry results would not be correct when either condition occurs within a photometry aperture .",
    "we try to deal with the problem by subtracting the local background from a pixel containing double fluxes because that pixel will also contain double the background counts . on the other hand",
    ", we put the counts of the local background into those pixels with zero flux .",
    "these procedures minimize the errors on the photometry . we note that on average , only approximately 500 pixels ( ranging from 0 to 3,000 depending on the rotation angle ) are affected for each chip .",
    "given that the total number of objects in each chip is @xmath30 and that the average diameter of the photometry aperture is 14 pixels , we estimate that only @xmath31 pixels in photometry apertures are affected in each chip ; i.e. , only one object out of 100 is affected and the effect has been minimized by the method we described above ( the magnitude difference before and after the transformation for an affected object is less than 0.02 magnitude ) .    additionally , the transformed image of each chip often overlaps with several nearby chips of the original image , and the matched regions from other chips are also cropped and included in the transformed image .",
    "we note that within each pointing , images from all the chips have been scaled to have the same zeropoint .",
    "an example of a re - sampled @xmath2 image is shown in figure  [ matching - image ] .",
    "the gaps between chips are also filled with counts of the local background .",
    "objects falling into the gaps are lost .",
    "the final transformed @xmath2 and @xmath3 images are matched with the @xmath1 images for the same fields .",
    "the typical shift is between a few pixels to one hundred pixels .",
    "the typical rotation angle is about 0.03 degree and the largest angle is less than one degree .",
    "after the matching is done , we apply the coordinate file of objects from the @xmath1 image to perform the aperture photometry procedure .",
    "since the same coordinate file is used for the data in different filters , the object i d of each object in different filters of the same pointing remains the same .",
    "the multi - color photometric catalog can be generated very easily by just combining the photometric results object by object directly .",
    "the colors are measured using identical apertures for all four filters , as prescribed in @xcite .",
    "the preliminary @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometric calibrations ( zero - point , airmass , and color terms ) were taken directly from the cfht elixir solutions in the image fits file headers .",
    "the elixir system at cfht provides real - time data quality assessment , end - of - run detailed calibration analysis , and image pre - processing and meta - data compilation for data distribution .",
    "data taken under bad weather conditions are calibrated by short exposures taken in photometric nights .",
    "however , we find that the color ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) vs. color ( @xmath34 ) diagrams have offsets from pointing to pointing , and sometimes the offsets are as large as @xmath35 magnitude , which implies that the photometric calibrations are not sufficiently accurate .",
    "an example of the differences between two pointings on the color - color diagram is shown in figure  [ color - color ] .",
    "hence , we use the following method to recalibrate the photometry . according to a recent star count study @xcite ,",
    "although the densities of stars would be different for different fields , the normalized color distributions for bright stars are very similar from field to field as long as the selected fields are sufficiently large . based on this result , we recalibrated the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 photometry by using the @xmath36 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 color distributions , assuming that the photometry of @xmath1 calibrated by standard stars is correct @xcite .",
    "stars with @xmath37 are selected to determine the magnitude offsets on a pointing - to - pointing and patch - to - patch basis .",

    "the magnitude offsets in @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are computed using cross - correlation of the distributions of @xmath36 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively , between the reference pointing and the test pointing .",

    "the recalibrated data have less scatter between patches than the elixir - calibrated data in all the panels , especially for @xmath3 . figure  [ sdss - sd ] shows the standard deviations of the @xmath40mag values for @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 among the different pointings within each rcs patch . here we first fit the above transformation equations to each patch as a whole , transform the sdss magnitudes accordingly , and then compute the median offset between rcs magnitudes and transformed sdss magnitudes for each pointing within a patch .",
    "the standard deviations of these pointing - by - pointing offsets are plotted in figure  [ sdss - sd ] .",

    "the pointing - to - pointing recalibrations reduce the standard deviations dramatically for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this rcs - sdss comparison proves that recalibration using the color distributions of bright stars significantly improves the calibrations of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry over the original elixir - based calibrations , and that most of the original photometric calibrations ( as performed by rcs , @xcite ) for @xmath0 are already good .",
    "galactic extinction has to be applied to the data before doing photometric redshift fitting .",
    "the extinction values are calculated according to prescriptions from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the galactic extinction values for the four filters for each patch are shown in table  [ extinction ] .",
    "note that our procedure will tend to result in slightly wrong galactic extinction corrections for the @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 filters , since the stars used in the recalibration procedure already suffer extinction to some extent and the recalibration procedure will have corrected for some of the extinction differences among the patches .",
    "however , the error we make is reduced because we use colors in the recalibration and because we use relative shifts among the patches .",
    "for example , if we assume that the stars we use already suffer the full amount of galactic extinction , then for patch 2318 , which has the largest @xmath43 value , we would have made only errors of -0.049 , -0.022 , and 0.024 mag for @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 , respectively .",

    "more distant galaxies have fainter magnitudes , and for a reasonable range of galaxy types , they also have redder observed colors . hence by using some appropriate boundaries to divide galaxies in the color - magnitude plane , we can mimic very roughly the effect of separating galaxies of different types at different redshifts .",

    "the rms scatter remains roughly the same , but it becomes @xmath77 for an object at @xmath78 .",

    "basically the photometric redshift uncertainty for an individual object comes from two sources .",
    "one source is the error in the photometric data themselves , and the other source is the uncertainty in the empirical fitting parameters in the quadratic formula . as described below , we will use the combination of a monte - carlo method and a bootstrap method to estimate the effect of both these error sources and thereby compute the total photometric redshift error for each object .",
    "we refer to this error as the `` estimated '' or `` computed '' error .    the measurement error of the photometry is estimated from two sources .",

    "our computed error estimate is intended to cover the 68% error range , regardless of the shape of the photometric redshift error distribution .",

    "this near exact agreement of the empirical and computed error is fortuitous .",
    "when different methods of separating the training set are used , in general there is an offset and/or scaling of the computed error relative to the empirical error .",

    "higher than 1.2 , the 4000 break is moving out of the reddest filter ( @xmath0 ) .",

    "the errors become larger but there are still a significant number of galaxies with errors less than 0.1 . for objects with @xmath95 ,",
    "the photometric redshift errors are greater than 0.3 , which is due to larger photometric errors and also to a higher fraction of late - type galaxies . generally speaking ,",
    "the photometric redshift error increases with magnitude due to larger photometric uncertainty .",
    "although the galaxies are fit separately in several color and magnitude bins , the rms scatter for bluer galaxies is still much larger than the scatter for redder galaxies ( shown in figure  [ color - err ] ) .",
    "this is because early - type ( redder ) galaxies have some significant spectral features ( e.g. , the 4000 break ) and have similar seds , while late - type ( bluer ) galaxies tend to have a featureless and relatively flat continuum .",
    "ongoing star formation , gas absorption / emission , and dust extinction will also complicate the seds of late - type galaxies , and different galaxies have different combinations of these effects . because different late - type galaxies have weaker features and larger variation in their seds than early - type galaxies ,",
    "the errors in the photometric redshift estimates will be larger for late - type galaxies .",
    "we compare the photometric redshift technique we use to other techniques described in @xcite .",
    "they use nine different methods including template fits and empirical fits to estimate photometric redshifts for the sdss early data release . from their study , in general , the results using empirical fits have smaller @xmath74 than the ones using template fits , and the best algorithm with the smallest @xmath74 among the empirical fits is also the kd - tree method . however , the kd - tree method they use is a two - dimensional tree to cut their training set in a color - color plane , unlike what we use , which is a three - dimensional tree in a color - color - magnitude space .",
    "the addition of magnitudes provides a rough estimate of redshift which makes the separation of the training set more precise than using just colors .",
    "combining deeper photometry , a larger training set over a wide redshift range , and a better cutting method for the training set , the limiting magnitude of our photometric redshift result is @xmath96 magnitudes deeper than the sdss result , even with only four wide - band filters ( compared to five filters for sdss ) and a much higher redshift limit .",
    "however , qualitatively , the agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshift is similar between the sdss and the rcs ; e.g. , the very low redshift galaxies tend to have over - estimated photometric redshifts .",
    "to test our photometric redshift results , we compare the redshift distributions of our data against the photometric redshift distributions from the canada - france deep fields ( cfdf)@xcite , and the spectroscopic redshift distributions for the goods / hdf - n field @xcite .",
