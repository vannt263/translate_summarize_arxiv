    "during the last years , ample evidence for the presence of intruder excitations , in particular at and near closed - shell regions  @xcite has been accumulated throughout the nuclear mass table .",
    "such intruder excitations , which give rise to shape coexistence and collective band structures , are particularly well documented in the @xmath2 ( sn ) and @xmath1 ( pb ) mass regions .",
    "they can be associated with many - particle many - hole proton excitations across the closed shells  @xcite but can also be studied , in an equivalent way , using potential energy surface calculations  @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of @xmath0 intruder excitations in the even - even pb nuclei , down to mass @xmath3  @xcite , the development of recoil and recoil - decay - tagging ( rdt ) techniques and of heavy - ion induced fusion - evaporation reactions  @xcite have led to a wealth of new data on collective bands in the pb isotopes that have neutron number near @xmath4 . the large number of experiments carried out over the last few years are described in a review paper by julin _",
    "et al . _",
    "study of the fine - structure of alpha decay of the very neutron - deficient nuclei has also proven to be an excellent tool  @xcite to identify excited @xmath0 states and was used for the first observation of a set of three low - lying @xmath0 excitations in @xmath5pb  @xcite .",
    "the above two major experimental techniques have been instrumental in exploring unexpected new phenomena concerning intruder states and shape coexistence .    with these methods ,",
    "data have become available on @xmath6pb  @xcite , @xmath5pb @xcite , @xmath7pb  @xcite and @xmath8pb  @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence for close - lying @xmath0 excitations and for associated collective band structures ( see fig .  [ pbrudi ] ) has brought about the need to explore and study the effects of mixing among these structures .",
    "a first attempt using two - level mixing for the low - lying @xmath0 and @xmath9 excitations in @xmath10pb was carried out by van duppen _ et al . _",
    "the importance of mixing between bands was put in a broader context by dracoulis  @xcite in the os - pt - hg - pb region .",
    "more recently , detailed two - band mixing calculations  @xcite and an attempt to perform a three - band mixing study in @xmath5pb  @xcite have been reported , albeit all starting from phenomenological band - mixing assumptions .",
    "so , there is a clear need to perform a detailed study of these nuclei .",
    "we also mention that intruder @xmath0 states and associated bands have been studied in the neutron - deficient pt nuclei  @xcite down to mass @xmath11 and in the po nuclei  @xcite in an effort to distinguish collective vibrational excitations from intruder states .",
    "deformed mean - field calculations  @xcite have indicated the possibility of obtaining oblate and prolate minima close to the spherical ground - state configuration in the total energy surface for the pb nuclei for neutron numbers close to @xmath4 . in the hg nuclei with a ground state corresponding to a slightly deformed oblate configuration , a second , prolate configuration is predicted with minimal energy near mid - shell ( @xmath4 ) , while in the pt nuclei a crossing of both minima is found and the prolate deformed minimum becomes the lowest configuration at mid - shell . in",
    "the po nuclei the situation is more complicated  @xcite with an oblate minimum which approaches the spherical ground - state configuration near @xmath12 , and a prolate minimum which becomes dominant in the ground state for even lower neutron numbers .",
    "the above studies have the drawback that only the static potential energy surface properties are studied .",
    "many - particle many - hole ( @xmath13p-@xmath14h ) excitations can not be incorporated easily in full large - scale shell - model studies because of the extremely large dimensions of the model spaces involved .",
    "these @xmath13p-@xmath14h excitations , however , can be handled within an algebraic framework of the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion in ibm of the simplest 2p-2h intruder excitations in the form of two extra nucleon pairs ( two bosons ) and the study of the mixing with the regular configurations was suggested by duval and barrett  @xcite and applied in the pb region to the hg nuclei  @xcite , the pt nuclei  @xcite and the po nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these ibm - mixing calculations , however , generally implied the introduction of many parameters .",
    "calculations including up to 6p-6h excitations have been carried out , using a simplified hamiltonian , with the aim of studying high - spin properties and backbending within the ibm configuration mixing picture by j. jolie et al @xcite . in an effort to remove the obstacle of introducing many parameters when carrying out such ibm configuration mixing calculations with various mp - nh excitations ,",
    "the symmetries connecting particle and hole bosons have been put forward in an algebraic framework and led to the introduction of a new label , called _ intruder spin _ or @xmath15 spin  @xcite and to applications in the pb region  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "explored in detail in a series of papers  @xcite , both the particle and hole shell - model configurations are handled as interacting particle- and hole - like @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons .",
    "the method also allows , in principle , the mixing of two dynamical symmetries .    the experimental need to explore three families each with a different intrinsic structure ( spherical , oblate and prolate or , in a spherical shell - model language , the 2p-2h and 4p-4h intruder excitations next to the regular ones of 0p-0h type ) forms the starting point of the present study .",
    "an exploratory calculation of this kind within an algebraic framework has already been reported  @xcite but was confined to the @xmath0 band heads . in this paper",
    "an ibm - mixing calculation that describes the three different intrinsic ` shape ' configurations is performed , and applied to the very neutron - deficient pb nuclei .",
    "the regular ( reg ) 0p-0h states are described in terms of @xmath18 bosons while the intruder 2p-2h and 4p-4h states require @xmath19 and @xmath20 bosons , respectively .",
    "the model space thus consists of the sum of three symmetric u(6 ) representations @xmath21\\oplus[n+2]\\oplus[n+4]$ ] .",
    "the model hamiltonian has the form @xmath22 the different parts are @xmath23 with the @xmath17-boson number operator @xmath24 and the quadrupole operator @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for a regular , 2p-2h or 4p-4h configuration .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 corresponds to the single - particle energy needed to create a 2p-2h excitation , corrected for the gain in binding energy due to pairing .",
    "likewise , @xmath28 corresponds to the single - particle energy needed to create a 4p-4h excitation ( corrected for pairing ) , with @xmath29 .",
    "eigensolutions depend primarily on the ratio @xmath30 . for @xmath31",
    "the solution is vibrational while for @xmath32 it is rotational .",
    "in addition , the parameter @xmath33 in the quadrupole operator  ( [ q ] ) determines whether the solution is su(3 ) ( axially deformed , @xmath34 ) or so(6 ) ( triaxially unstable , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the hamiltonians used in  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) represent the simplest parametrisation of the ibm which encompasses its different limits , u(5 ) vibrational , su(3 ) rotational and so(6 ) @xmath36 soft . often a rotational term @xmath37 is added but this is not needed here .",
    "the mixing of the different configurations is induced by @xmath38 , which is assumed to be of lowest possible order in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons , @xmath39 with @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 mixes the regular ( 0p-0h ) and 2p-2h configurations while @xmath43 mixes the 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations .",
    "note that care is taken to introduce different ( 0p-0h)-(2p-2h ) and ( 2p-2h)-(4p-4h ) mixing parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , and that there is no direct mixing between the 0p-0h and 4p-4h configurations .",
    "the latter statement is suggested by the observation that the matrix element of a two - body interaction between 0p-0h and 4p-4h states is zero .    to obtain an estimate of the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "assume in first approximation that the dominant component of the 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations involves pairs of particles ( holes ) in a single @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) shell coupled to zero angular momentum .",
    "for a pairing force the following ratio of mixing matrix elements is obtained : @xmath48 in the limit of large shells , the mixing between the 2p-2h and 4p-4h @xmath0 states is thus twice as strong as that between the ground state and the 2p-2h states .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding ratio , obtained with the mixing hamiltonian  ( [ mix ] ) and a u(5 ) vibrational classification of states , equals @xmath49 in the limit of large boson number , @xmath50 should thus be twice as big as @xmath51 to recover the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) . in the present application to the pb isotopes , the boson number @xmath18 is such that the square root in eq .",
    "( [ u5 ] ) equals about 0.8 , by which factor @xmath50 should be reduced to account for the finite boson number .",
    "another and perhaps more important fact is that both eqs .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) and  ( [ u5 ] ) are derived for a spherical configuration .",
    "it is clear that deformation may drastically change the ratio of mixing matrix elements and , specifically , it may reduce both matrix elements because of the smaller overlap between states with different deformation .",
    "thus the microscopic estimate @xmath52 can not be adhered to rigidly and several calculations corresponding to different combinations of mixing matrix elements must be explored .        in the even - even pb nuclei , @xmath53 valence neutrons form a ground state which is predominantly of seniority zero , @xmath54 .",
    "this can be viewed as a condensate of neutron pairs coupled to @xmath0 .",
    "excited states are first built from one broken pair ( @xmath55 ) with @xmath56 , next two broken pairs ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58 and so on . to describe these spherical states in an ibm context , we consider the hamiltonian  ( [ reg ] ) with a spherical structure [ symmetry limit u(5 ) ] and which has @xmath59 as the only parameter .",
    "we fix this parameter to the @xmath60 state of the heavier pb isotopes @xmath61 to 204 , where the @xmath13p-@xmath14h intruder states are high in energy and have little effect on the low - excited spherical states ( see fig .",
    "[ pbrudi ] ) .",
    "we do not consider the one broken pair @xmath62 ( @xmath63 boson ) or @xmath64 ( @xmath26 boson),  states , which can only be described within extended boson models .",
    "a constant hamiltonian for this regular configuration , @xmath65 , yields a constant excitation energy for the @xmath60 state , independent of the number of bosons .",
    "the excitation energy of the observed states , however , changes slightly with mass number @xmath66 ( because of shell effects ) .",
    "we choose @xmath67 mev ; this value is a compromise between a @xmath60 state which is somewhat too low and other states that increase too rapidly in energy with angular momentum .",
    "a better fixing of @xmath59 could have been obtained by a variation of @xmath59 linear with the number of bosons . for the sake of simplicity",
    "this is not done here .",
    "the spectroscopic information on the neutron - deficient pb isotopes is limited .",
    "we use @xmath15-spin symmetry arguments in order to find the ibm parameters of the two intruder configurations in pb from corresponding bands in neighbouring nuclei where more experimental information is available .    before deriving the parameters for the 2p-2h configuration in pb , we first show in fig .",
    "[ pb_2p2h ] the correspondence between the experimental 2p-2h intruder band in @xmath68pb  the only pb isotope where it is known(left panel ) and the intruder analogue regular 0p-4h ground - state band in @xmath69pt ( middle panel ) .",
    "this 0p-4h band is also shown for other pt isotopes from mass numbers @xmath70 to 200 , where the coexisting 2p-6h intruder configuration lies high in energy and has little influence on the 0p-4h band .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ pb_2p2h ] shows an ibm calculation of the 0p-4h band in the pt isotopes which , using a constant hamiltonian @xmath71 with @xmath72 given in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "the band head of the @xmath36 band , the @xmath73 level , is also taken into account in order to restrict the possible parameter values .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is fixed in order to reproduce the observed ratio @xmath74 @xmath75 which is 0.00732 in @xmath69pt  @xcite and 0.00485 in @xmath76pt  @xcite .",
    "theoretical values are 0.00711 and 0.00500 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the experimental spectra for pb and pt are very similar up to @xmath64 .",
    "intruder spin symmetry appears to be a good approximation , and so it seems reasonable to use the 0p-4h parameters of pt to describe the pb intruder 2p-2h configuration .",
    "in the same way we derive the parameters for the 4p-4h configuration in pb . in fig .",
    "[ pb_pt_w6 ] we show the observed analogue bands of the 4p-4h intruder configuration in the pb isotopes ( left panel ) , the 2p-6h intruder configuration in the pt isotopes ( second panel ) and the regular 0p-8h ground - state configuration in the w isotopes ( third panel ) . in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ pb_pt_w6 ] , an ibm calculation for this 0p-8h band in the w isotopes is shown , with the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) again with constant parameters for all isotopes .",
    "this calculation also includes the @xmath73 level , the bandhead of the @xmath36 band .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is fixed from the experimental ratio  ( [ r ] ) in @xmath8w , which lies in the range 0.02520.0295 according to the different references in  @xcite ; the calculated ratio is 0.0276 .",
    "again , @xmath15-spin symmetry seems to be valid in this case and we use the 0p-8h parameters of w to describe the 4p-4h configuration in pb .      with the three parameter sets ( @xmath77 )",
    "determined previously for the regular , 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations , a mixing must now be supplied that reproduces the experimental features of the three - configuration coexistence in the pb isotopes ( the extra parameters @xmath78 ) .",
    "the final set of parameters is given in table  [ table ] . in table",
    "[ table2 ] , we present results on the mixing of the three configurations ( reg , 2p-2h and 4p-4h , respectively ) in the first three @xmath0 excited states .",
    "one clearly notices a rapid stabilization , close to 100% , for the @xmath79 state at the spherical configuration .",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath81 states indicate a strong mixing between the 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations .",
    "rather quickly , a dominance of the 2p-2h configuration is observed from @xmath82 up to heavier masses in the @xmath80 state . in table",
    "[ table3 ] , we identify , for @xmath83 , the bands which contain mainly the 2p-2h ( called `` 2p-2h '' band ) and the 4p-4h ( called `` 4p-4h '' band ) configuration for a particular @xmath84 value .",
    "one notices the `` 4p-4h '' band is related to the @xmath80 band head and follows up the @xmath85 states , whereas the `` 2p-2h '' band is connected to the @xmath81 band head and follows up the @xmath86 states , respectively .",
    "the results in tables  [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] are particularly illuminating in showing the mixing effects within the ibm configuration mixing .",
    "note that with constant parameters for all pb isotopes identical results are obtained for corresponding isotopes that are symmetric around the middle of the shell .",
    "the result of such a mixing calculation is shown in fig .",

    "[ pb_sph ] ( right panel ) , the slope with which the intruder states gain binding energy towards midshell is too steep , an effect that is independent of the mixing .",
    "apparently , @xmath15-spin symmetry is not satisfied completely . a possible cause for these differences between the experimental and theoretical band structures",
    "is the fact that the ibm parameters are obtained from separate calculations for the 2p-2h intruder excitations ( fig .",
    "[ pb_2p2h ] ) and 4p-4h intruder excitations ( fig .",
    "[ pb_pt_w6 ] ) . in the final calculation for the even - even pb nuclei , which includes the 2p-2h and 4p-4h intruder families together with the regular spherical configuration",
    ", the extra mixing effects will cause specific perturbations that may show up as a breaking of @xmath15-spin symmetry and may also affect the @xmath66-dependence of the intruder band energies .",
    "possible improvements can be expected from a more elaborate mixing study , treating _ all _ known data for the neutron - deficient pb isotopes and relevant nuclei in the @xmath87 region . a further constraint would also be imposed by the condition that the lowest - lying proton 2p-2h @xmath0 excitations approach the observed energy at @xmath88 mev in @xmath89pb .",
    "such extensive calculations , aiming to describe besides energy spectra and band structures also known electromagnetic ( mostly e2 and e0 ) properties , isotopic and isomeric shifts and nuclear ground - state binding energies , will be pursued in the near future .",
    "very recently , calculations have been carried out by c. vargas et al .",
    "@xcite , in order to determine total energy surfaces , starting from the ibm parameters derived in the present paper ( see also table  [ table ] ) , using boson coherent states .",
    "we have explored in the present paper the possibility to describe the coexistence and mixing of three different families of excitations , corresponding to different intrinsic structures as observed in the pb isotopes . in a mean - field approach",
    "the three configurations correspond to spherical , oblate and prolate shapes while in a shell - model description they arise as regular 0p-0h states and 2p-2h and 4p-4h excitations across the @xmath1 proton shell .",
    "previous studies of such three - configuration systems were limited to the @xmath0 band heads ( without the associated bands ) either in a mean - field  @xcite or an ibm  @xcite approach , or , in @xmath5pb , to a phenomenological band - mixing calculation  @xcite .",

    "the three configurations are described as @xmath18- , @xmath90- and @xmath91-boson states . to reduce the number of parameters that appear in such a configuration mixing calculation , use is made of the concept of intruder - spin symmetry  @xcite , relating configurations with different numbers of particle ( @xmath92 ) and hole ( @xmath93 ) bosons ( i.e. , fermion pairs ) , but with a constant sum @xmath94 in this way experimental excitation energies in adjacent pt and w nuclei are used to fix the essential ibm parameters .",
