    "very massive stars were long ago predicted to get hot enough that the ambient photons in the interior are sufficiently energetic to create electon / positron pairs ( rakavy & shaviv 1967 ; barkat , rakavy & sack 1967 ; rakavy & shaviv 1968 ; rakavy , shaviv & zinamon 1968 ; fraley 1968 ; see also wheeler 1977 ; el eid & hilf 1977 ; el eid , fricke & ober 1983 ; carr , bond & arnett 1984 ; stringfellow & woosley 1988 ) . the conversion of energy to rest mass rather than thermal energy alters the equation of state so that the pressure does not increase sufficiently with density upon compression to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium . if a sufficiently large , mass - averaged region of the star is in the pair - formation regime , such that @xmath1  @xmath2  4/3 , the structure will be dynamically unstable .",
    "models predict that this happens after stars have undergone their central helium burning and have formed massive cores composed primarily of oxygen ( with a small mass fraction of carbon ) . in models ,",
    "the instability occurs in an off - center shell .",
    "the rapid contraction of this shell drives it inward , leading to the rapid compression and heating of the inner core of oxygen . unlike the case of iron - core collapse ,",
    "the oxygen in these stars is subject to strong energy release by rapid thermonuclear burning .",
    "the result is the prediction that the star is totally disrupted , leaving no remnant , but with the production of a very large mass of radioactive @xmath3ni , the decay of which could power the light output .",
    "the original calculations , cited above , found that the pair - instability regime was encountered for stars with massive oxygen cores , greater than about 60  @xmath0 . at the time , it was not clear how massive a star needed to be to develop a sufficiently massive oxygen core , but estimates were in the range of 100  @xmath0 .",
    "it was also not clear that any stars sufficiently massive to reach this condition of instability existed .",
    "the latter point was resolved theoretically with the understanding that massive , radiation - pressure dominated stars subject to dynamical instability would be stabilized in the non - linear regime ( appenzeller 1970 ; ziebarth 1970 ) and observationally with the discovery that young clusters such as r  136 in 30 doradus contained very massive stars ( panagia et al .",
    "1983 ; hunter et al .",
    "1995 ; crowther et al .",
    "a subsequent important development was the prediction that in the context of @xmath4cdm models of the universe , the first stars forming at zero metallicity after the dark ages might preferentially form especially massive stars that would , in turn , be subject to pair instability ( abel et al .",
    "1998 ; abel et al .",
    "2000 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm & larson 2004 ) .",
    "considerable effort has gone into the computation of the formation of the first stars , the evolution of stars that will reach pair - instability conditions , and the predicted observational properties of the resulting explosions ( heger & woosley 2002 , ohkubo et al .",

    "pair - instability supernovae ( pisn ) models have a characteristic nucleosynthetic yield ( heger & woosley 2002 ; ohkubo et al .",
    "2003 ) , but searches for evidence of such a distribution in the lowest metallicity stars has not revealed the expected pattern ( christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ; frebel et al .",
    "2005 ) . in general ,",
    "lower metallicity will suppress mass loss and allow relatively lower mass main sequence stars to encounter the pair - instability regime .",
    "for a given main sequence mass , higher metallicity will tend to lead to lower mass oxygen cores , thus avoiding this regime .",
    "two subsequent developments have altered the context in which pair instability is considered .",
    "one is the recent understanding that conditions of the first stars may be more susceptible to fragmentation so that the first stars may have been of smaller mass than once thought ( stacy et al .",
    "2010 ; greif et al .",
    "another important development was the discovery in the contemporary universe of a category of super - luminous supernovae ( slsn ) that are relatively rare , but brighter by a factor of 10 to 100 than most contemporary supernovae ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ; quimby et al . 2007 ; miller et al . 2009 ; gal - yam et al . 2010 ; chatzopoulos , wheeler & vinko 2011 ) .",
    "some of these slsn show evidence of high mass , but can not be pair - instability supernovae ( smith et al . 2007 ; miller et al . 2009 ;",
    "chatzopoulos , wheeler & vinko 2011 ; chatzopoulos , wheeler & vinko 2012 ; leloudas et al . 2012 ) .",
    "if their brightness derived from the radioactive decay of @xmath3ni , as demanded by the pair - instability model , they would require a greater mass of @xmath3ni than is allowed for the total mass of the ejecta .",
    "the ejecta mass is constrained by the width of the light curve that is a measure of the diffusion time .",
    "the great luminosity of super - luminous supernovae like sn  2006gy probably derives from the collision of the ejecta with a shell of matter previously ejected by the progenitor star ( smith et al . 2007 ; chevalier & irwin 2011 ; chatzopoulos , wheeler & vinko , 2011 ) .",
    "several of these super - luminous events do , however , have all the characteristics expected of a pisn ( sn 2007bi , gal - yam et al . 2010 ; ptf 10nmn , yaron et al . in preparation ) .",
    "these events have occured in low , but not zero , metallicity environments .",
    "the possibility that the first stars are not of especially high mass and the discovery of contemporary super - luminous supernovae that have the characteristics of pisn brings a new focus to the issue of just which stars can undergo pair instability and under what conditions .",
    "maeder ( 1987 ; see also maeder & meynet 2011 for a review ) discussed the effects of rotationally - induced mixing on the evolution of massive stars .",
    "he concluded that there would be substantial mixing produced by the small - scale three - dimensional tail of the turbulent spectrum of the baroclinic instability and that the diffusion coefficient could be sufficiently large to mix most massive stars during their main sequence lifetimes .",
    "in particular , above a critical rotation , maeder predicted that the evolutionary tracks go upwards and bluewards , very close to those of fully homogeneous evolution .",
    "the immediate implication was that stars in the mass range predicted to reach pair instability ( already radiation - pressure dominated and hence close to neutral dynamical instability ) were susceptible to quasi - homogeneous evolution such that nearly all the main sequence mass could be burned to heavier elements .",
    "quasi - homogeneous evolution would significantly decrease the main sequence mass that leads to pair instability .",
    "the notion that quasi - homogeneous evolution might lead to larger core masses has been applied in the context of the progenitors of grbs ( heger , woosley & spruit 2005 ; yoon & langer 2005 ) and explored to a certain extent in recent work ( langer et al .",
    "2007 , eskstrom et al . 2008 , 2011 ; brott et al .",
    "2011a , 2011b ) , but has not been pursued in detail in the context of pair instability .    in this paper",
    ", we conduct a thorough parameter study to explore the minimum main sequence mass that encounters the pair instability regime . in his unpublished phd thesis , barkat ( 1967 ) noted that some models that skirted the pair - instability regime ejected shells of matter , but survived the instability and continued to evolve .",
    "somewhat higher mass models became sufficiently unstable that a dynamical explosion , a pisn , was produced directly .",
    "woosley , blinnikov & heger ( 2007 ) invoked the former effect , that they called a pulsational pair instability supernova ( ppisn ) to address the nature of slsn  2006gy .",
    "their simulations showed a repeated ejection of shells .",
    "the second , faster shell collided with the first and produced a luminous display reminiscent of the light curve of slsn  2006gy . here",
    "we will delineate models that encounter the ppisn and those that encounter the full pisn explosion .",
    "section 2 describes our assumptions and models ,  3 gives the results and presents a model that invokes a different mixing criterion and another with solar metallicity and mass loss .",
    "section 4 discusses our conclusions .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the masses of stars that evolve from the main sequence to either ppisn or pisn will be a function of metallicity , mass loss , and rotationally - induced mixing .",
    "the outcome will also depend on the treatment of convective instability , semi - convection , and overshoot .",
    "dissipation of shear by magnetic effects may also attend the rotationally - induced mixing . rather than explore this whole parameter space where the physics is , in any case , uncertain , we have focused on the portion of parameter space that is expected to lead to the minimum mass to encounter pair formation . in particular ,",
    "we have explored conditions of zero metallicity and have neglected mass loss for the majority of our models in order to establish the proof of principle .",
    "we have run a few models at solar metallicity in order to put our results in context .",
    "we have adopted rates of rotation on the main sequence that run from non - rotating to rotating at 80 % of equatorial keplerian velocity .",
    "we have focused on schwarzschild convection for two reasons .",
    "one is that this prescription will tend to enhance the mass of the oxygen core for a given main sequence mass , in keeping with the philosophy of this exploratory work . the second reason is based on a suspicion that neither the schwarzschild nor the ledoux criterion really captures the three - dimensional , plume - driven convection in real stars . as we will describe in a future work ( chatzopoulos , dearborn & wheeler , in preparation ) , we have grounds to believe that in the late stages , when the oxygen core forms , the schwarzschild criterion is the more appropriate .",
    "multi - dimensional effects tend to swamp the stabilizing effect of composition gradients .",
    "our simulations have also adopted the effects of magnetic viscosity as parametrized by heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) based on the prescriptions of spruit ( 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "this is not because we believe that this particular parametrization captures all the relevant multi - dimensional mhd instabilities and related phenomona in rotating , shearing , stars , but because it is a widely used and recognized algorithm so that our results can be readily compared to others using the same prescription .",
    "we have used the modules for stellar experiments in astrophysics ( mesa ; paxton et al .",
    "2011 ) code to calculate the evolution of a grid of @xmath5  0 massive stars ranging from zero age main sequence ( zams ) mass of 35  @xmath0 to 200  @xmath0 for four different degrees of zams rotation .",
    "we assume initially rigid body rotation on the zams with surface rotation corresponding to 0 , 30% , 50% and 80% of the critical keplerian rotation @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8  @xmath9 is the gravitational acceleration at the  surface \" of the star , @xmath10 the gravitational constant , @xmath11 the mass , @xmath12 the radius of the star and @xmath13 the eddington factor where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the total radiated luminosity and the eddington luminosity respectively .",
    "the 35  @xmath0 model was only run for maximum rotation ( 80% ) in order to establish the lower mass limit for ppisn and the models above 85  @xmath0 for lower ( 30% ) and zero degrees of rotation to establish the corresponding minimum zams mass for ppisn .",
    "the models with zams masses 40 - 85  @xmath0 were run in bins of 5  @xmath0 for all the selected degrees of rotation in order to better resolve the limits for different final fates of the stars . in order to benchmark against the results of heger & woosley ( 2002 ) and woosley , blinnikov & heger ( 2007 ) for non - rotating stars that will produce a pure pisn and a ppisn , respectively",
    ", we have run a 110  @xmath0 and a 200  @xmath0 model ( zams masses ) without rotation .",
    "the reason that we chose this range of zams masses is the fact that heger & woosley ( 2002 ) and heger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) predict that oxygen core masses ( @xmath16 ) ranging from 40 - 64  @xmath0 will undergo ppisn while 64  @xmath17  133  @xmath0 will explode as direct pisne for non - rotating progenitors , but with significantly rapid rotation a lower zams mass can produce oxygen core masses in this range .",
    "mesa was run with the schwarzschild criterion for convection implemented for reasons discussed above and for zero mass loss .",
    "it should be mentioned that rotationally induced mass loss may reduce the final oxygen core masses .",
    "ekstrom et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that rapidly rotating zero metallicity stars with zams masses above @xmath18  50  @xmath0 may lose up to @xmath18  11  @xmath0 ; however due to the lack of understanding of mass loss mechanisms in massive stars this remains uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , we also conducted calculations with mass loss included in models with initially zero metallicity , as described in  3.2 , to estimate the impact of mass loss on the final fate of the models .",
    "mesa employs a combination of prescriptions for the equation of state ( eos ) , but for high density and temperature plasma the helm eos ( timmes & swesty 2000 ) is used .",
    "the helm eos accounts for pressure induced by radiation , ions , electrons , positrons and corrections for coulomb effects and therefore for the effects of electron - positron pair formation , which drives the adiabatic index @xmath19 below 4/3 . for the treatment of nuclear processes with mesa we employ the  approx21 \" network ( timmes 1999 ) , which covers all major stellar nuclear reaction rates .",
    "the effects of angular momentum transport via rotation and magnetic fields are treated based on the one - dimensional approximations of spruit ( 1999 , 2002 ) and heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) .",
    "mesa is capable of running stellar models up to the core collapse ( cc ) and pre - supernova ( pre - sn ) stage ; however for high mass stellar models that encounter a degree of instability induced by electron - positron pair production the effects become very dynamic and a challenge for a stellar evolution code to handle .",
    "future expansions of mesa will be able to handle those dynamical effects and to follow the supernova ( sn ) explosions of stars with 1-d hydrodynamics implemented ( paxton ; private communication ) . in the current work , stellar models for which a signficant fraction of their core approaches the @xmath20  4/3 regime due to pair formation are stopped before core oxygen ignition and within the carbon burning phase , shortly before becoming dynamic .",
    "those models are then mapped into the multi - dimensional hydrodynamics code flash ( fryxell et al .",
    "2000 ) , and their evolution is followed in 1-d .",
    "the newest version of flash ( flash4-alpha release ) is used for these simulations .",
    "flash is very suitable to follow the dynamical transition of the models from mesa because it uses the same eos ( helm ; timmes & swesty 2000 ) and similar nuclear reaction network .",
    "ppisne are characterized by a violent contraction and pulsation that heats the core up to a temperature such that some of the oxygen is burned to produce primarily @xmath21si and @xmath22s ( woosley , blinnikov & heger 2007 ) .",
    "pure thermonuclear pisne are heated significantly enough from the dynamical collapse induced by the softening of the eos due to electron - positron pair formation that they burn oxygen explosively and large amounts of @xmath3ni are produced .",
    "flash is capable of reproducing those basic features of the events and is therefore used to establish the final fate of the models .",
    "we note that in the 1-d flash hydrodynamic simulations the effects of rotation are not considered . in a future work",
    "we plan to investigate the effects of rotation in the hydrodynamical stage of pisne with multi - dimensional flash simulations .",
    "table 1 summarizes the characteristics of all the models considered in this work ( for zero metallicity and mass loss turned off ) .",
    "the first column lists the zams mass ( @xmath23 , in solar masses ) , the second is the critical rotational ratio @xmath24 , the third and fourth the maximum central temperature ( in units of @xmath25  k and density ( in units of @xmath26  g  @xmath27 ) that were encountered due to the pair formation dynamical instability , the fifth the mass of the oxygen core , @xmath16 ( in units of solar masses ) , that each model produced , the sixth the surface abundance of @xmath28n and the seventh the final fate of the model as observed in the flash hydrodynamics simulations ( cc for core collapse , ppisn for pulsational pair instability supernova and pisn for pair instability supernova ) . in all figures ,",
    "the models that ended as cc will be represented by black curves , the models that encountered ppisn by green curves and the models that underwent pisn with red curves .    to compare with previous results for ppisn presented by woosley , blinnikov & heger ( 2007 ) in the case of a 110  @xmath0 zams star and for direct pisn presented by heger & woosley ( 2002 ) for a variety of stars with @xmath29",
    "140  @xmath0 we run our own non - rotating 110  @xmath0 and 200  @xmath0 models . the model with 110  @xmath0 formed a 56  @xmath0 oxygen core and",
    "then encountered a violent pulsation that heated the center of the star up to @xmath30  k , in a similar manner to that suggested by woosley , blinnikov & heger ( 2007 ) .",
    "the 200  @xmath0 model produced a direct pisn that synthesized a massive amount of @xmath3ni ( @xmath18  21  @xmath0 ) and totally disrupted the star , behaving exactly as predicted by woosley , blinnikov & heger ( 2007 ) .",
    "additionally , in order to establish a lower mass end for the production of ppisne , we have run a 35  @xmath0 model with rotation at 80% of the critical velocity that converted essentially all of its mass to oxygen .",
    "this model was able to evolve up to cc in mesa . for benchmarking",
    "it was also mapped to flash at the time of core oxygen ignition where it also kept slowly evolving toward higher densities and temperatures always avoiding the pair formation regime .",
    "for all the models , increased levels of rotation led to a more chemically homogeneous evolution and produced higher oxygen core masses .",
    "zams rotation at 80% of the critical keplerian velocity was able to convert all stellar mass into oxygen for all the models .",
    "the evolution of some models rotating at 80% yielded brief stages when rotation became mildly super - critical ( 110 - 120% ) at the surface which means that results from these models may not be completely accurate .",
    "for all other degrees of rotation the star remained at sub - critical velocities throughout all of its evolutionary track .",
    "as a representative example of this effect , we show the evolution of @xmath24 for the rotating 70  @xmath0 models during the main - sequence ( ms ) in figure 1 .",
    "the solid green curve , the dashed green curve and the solid red curve show the evolution of @xmath24 for zams rotation at 30 , 50 and 80% , respectively .    in order to illustrate the effects of rotation on a zams star with a specific mass we pick the 70  @xmath0 models because , as can be seen in table 1 , all possible final fates are encountered for this model ( cc for zero rotation , ppisn for 30% and 50% critical rotation and pisn for 80% critical rotation ) .",
    "the evolution of the central density ( @xmath31 ) and temperature ( @xmath32 ) for these models is presented in the left panel of figure 2 .",
    "as can be seen , all rotating models encounter a collapse that heats the core up to higher densities and temperatures , but the one rotating at 80% critical is heated significantly enough to burn oxygen explosively and subsequently ejects of all its mass .",
    "higher degrees of rotation lead the @xmath31-@xmath32 track of the star closer to the @xmath20  4/3 pair formation region .",
    "the right panel of figure 2 shows the tracks of the models in the hertzprung - russell diagram .",
    "it can be seen that the more rapidly rotating models remain bluer and are more luminous that the less rapidly rotating ones .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the chemical composition of the 70  @xmath0 models for all degrees of rotation at the time before core oxygen ignition ( upper left panel : no rotation ; upper right panel : 30% critical rotation ; lower left panel : 50% critical rotation ; lower right panel : 80% critical rotation ) .",
    "the effects of increased homogeneity and higher @xmath16 , with increasing rotation are clearly illustrated .",
    "figure 4 presents the distribution of the cno ( solid black curve ) and 3-@xmath33 process specific nuclear energy inputs are shown .",
    "higher degrees of rotation also produced a significantly higher @xmath28n surface abundance than their non - rotating counterparts , a trend also noted by ekstrom et al .",
    "this trend , however , is not monotonic . for the extreme level of 80% critical rotation the surface @xmath28n mass fraction",
    "is generally found to be reduced while the most significant @xmath28n enrichment is observed in models rotating at 50% of the critical value .",
    "increased surface @xmath28n is attributed to the onset of the cno cycle in the outer shell due to the strong rotationally induced mixing . for completely homogeneous evolution that makes an oxygen star , which takes place for models that rotate at the extreme level of 80% critical rotation , the cno contribution in outer layers of the star is confined to a very thin shell .",
    "figure 5 illustrates our final results for the fate of rotating massive primordial stars . as can be seen , stars initially rotating with speeds 80% the critical velocity with 40  @xmath0  @xmath34  60  @xmath0 will produce ppisne associated with episodic mass - loss and for @xmath35  65@xmath36 they will explode as pisne . as mentioned before , at this rapid rotation the whole mass of those stars will turn into oxygen , therefore this result is consistent with the findings of heger et al . (",
    "2003 ) , but for initial zams masses that are only 40 - 50% those of the ones given by their non - rotating calculations .",
    "consequently , for this  fiducial \" degree of rotation at 50% the critical value , the zams mass limits become 45  @xmath0  @xmath34  70@xmath36 for ppisn and @xmath35  75  @xmath0 for pisn progenitors , thus at the level of 50 - 60% of those in the case of no rotation .",
    "these results suggest that episodic mass - loss events resulting from ppisne can be encountered for less massive stars and may account for some of the observed lbv - type events .",
    "we wish to add that a recent paper by yoon , dierks & langer ( 2012 ) independently calculated the mass limits of ppisn and pisn primordial progenitors and found good agreement with our results .",
    "convective mixing and overshoot are some of the factors that control the final mass of the oxygen core .",
    "as mentioned above , in this work we have adopted the schwarzschild criterion for convection based on the lack of true knowledge about the nature of convection in realistic three - dimensional situations .",
    "one dimensional convective mixing will be supressed if composition gradients are considered , as suggested by the ledoux criterion for convection .",
    "this will result in smaller final oxygen core masses and therefore tracks in the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane that are shifted further away from the pair formation @xmath20  4/3 region , something that may alter the results for the minimum zams masses that encounter ppisn and pisn .",
    "we ran mesa for the 70  @xmath0 non - rotating and 50% critically rotating models with the ledoux criterion implemented in order to examine the sign of this effect .",
    "figure 6 presents the results in the case of zero rotation .",
    "the left panel shows the @xmath31-@xmath32 tracks for the model that uses the schwarzschild ( solid black curve ) and the model that uses the ledoux ( dashed black curve ) criterion .",
    "the right upper and lower panels show the chemical composition of the two models at the time before core oxygen ignition . it can be seen that when mixing is supressed the non - rotating 70  @xmath0 model evolves towards slightly lower @xmath31 and @xmath32 values and it ends up making an oxygen core that is 86% the one produced in the case where composition gradients are ignored . the result of the same experiment but in the case of rotation at the 50% of the critical value is shown in figure 7 . in this case , we see that the fast rotationally - induced mixing counters the effects of suppression due to the inclusion of composition gradients and the final oxygen core masses are almost equal",
    ". the characteristics of the models run with the ledoux criterion implemented are also given in table 1 .",
    "these results indicate that selecting a different one - dimensional prescription for convective mixing is unlikely to alter our results for the rotating models by any significant factor .",
    "although a thorough study of massive models with @xmath37  0 is beyond the scope of this project , which focuses on the primordial progenitors of pisne , we considered the effects that the presence of metals may have .",
    "as is well known , metallicities with @xmath370 can induce significant line - driven mass loss that can cause massive stars to lose a significant amount of mass .",
    "this mass loss will drive evolution towards the formation of oxygen cores with smaller mass than in the case of zero mass loss .",
    "this will have an effect on the final fate of a very massive star , such that it might miss the pair formation region in the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane and end its life as a cc sn explosion .",
    "the high mass loss may lead to the formation of massive circumstellar material ( csm ) environments around the progenitors of these sn so that the sn ejecta will violently interact with the csm producing shock energy that can power their light curve ( lc ) , as manifested by luminous type iin sne .    to account for the mass loss with mesa , the prescriptions of de jager , nieuwenhuijzen & van der hucht ( 1988 ) were used , as appropriate for hot o - type stars ( for a recent discussion on mass loss rates for wolf - rayet stars , see yoon , woosley & langer 2010 ) .",
    "figure 5 also shows the final fate of the same rotating massive zero metallicity stars for which mass loss is considered in the calculations . as mentioned above",
    ", rotationally - induced mixing will dredge up metals to the outer and less gravitationally bound regions of the star inducing line - driven mass loss that will ultimately result in smaller oxygen core mass .",
    "we find that when mass loss is considered , the minimum zams mass that produce ppisn events is @xmath18  50  @xmath0 and the minimum mass that produce pisn events is @xmath18  80  @xmath0 at maximum zams rotation ( 80% of the critical value ) .",
    "the results for the fate of the 70  @xmath0 model rotating at 50% the critical value with solar metallicity and mass loss are presented in figure 8 .",
    "the left panel of figure 8 shows a comparison between the @xmath31-@xmath32 tracks of the two models with ( solid black curve ) and without ( solid green curve ) mass loss , and the upper and lower right panels show the chemical composition of the models at the time before core oxygen ignition .",
    "the strong line - driven mass loss ejected the hydrogen and a fraction of the helium shell leaving a 33  @xmath0 star with @xmath38  16  @xmath0 that ended its life as a cc sn .",
    "the strong continuous mass loss led the @xmath31-@xmath32 track of the model further from the electron - positron pair @xmath20  4/3 region .",
    "furthermore , due to strong rotationally - induced mixing the pre - sn model had an enhanced @xmath28n surface abundance as was the case with most rotating @xmath5  0 models .",
    "the extreme amount of mass lost by the star that we compute here is consistent with results presented by ekstrom et al .",
    "( 2011 ) who calculated the evolution of a grid of solar metallicity models from 0.8 to 120  @xmath0 rotating at 40% the critical velocity .",

    "this result indicates that ppisn and , even more so , pisn events that may result from local ( @xmath39  @xmath40 ) massive progenitors must be very rare compared to those that result from metal - poor primordial progenitors .",
    "recently , stacy et al . ( 2011 ) determined the rotational speed of massive primordial stars to be close to 50% of the critical value using multi - dimensional smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",
    "in addition , observational evidence presented by dufton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) on the 20 - 30@xmath0 late o - type star vfts102 in 30 doradus indicates a rotational speed @xmath41  50% of the critical value for this star .",
    "vfts102 has @xmath37  0 and is not massive enough to encounter pair formation in any circumstances , but it establishes the existence of fast rotation in some high mass stars . using mesa to follow the evolution and flash to compute the late time hydrodynamics for a grid of massive primordial ( @xmath5  0 ) stars with various degrees of rotation and including the effects of magnetic fields as currently parametrized , we established the zams mass ranges required to produce ppisn or pisn as presented in figure 5 . for significant rotational velocities ,",
    "we find that stars with zams masses as low as 40 - 45  @xmath0 can produce ppisn and stars with zams masses @xmath41  65 - 75  @xmath0 can produce direct pisn explosions due to a more chemically homogeneous evolution that leads to increased oxygen core masses .",
    "we also investigated the effects of convective mixing , metallicity and mass loss .",
    "we found that suppressed mixing due to composition gradients is unlikely to significantly alter the results for the rotating models since rotationally - induced mixing is the dominant factor .",
    "we also found that higher metallicities ( and specifically solar metalicity ) can induce extreme line - driven mass loss so that even some of the most massive zams stars end their lives as cc sne avoiding the pair - formation instability .",
    "current results from numerical simulations ( greif et al . 2011 ) suggest a nearly flat primordial initial mass function ( imf ) with typical mass of 100  @xmath0",
    ". if so , pisn and especially ppisn events may be more frequent than estimates suggest based on non - rotating models ( scannapieco et al .",
    "this raises the possibility of detecting a larger number of those spectacular explosions with future missions such the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .",
    "as emphasized by smith & owocki ( 2006 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , stars under a wide variety of conditions may undergo the mass ejection process associated with luminous blue variables ( lbv ) .",
    "the physical mechanism of the lbv phenomenon is not well understood .",
    "ppisn is not likely to be the only mechanism involved in the lbv process , but our result that stars with initial mass as low as 40  @xmath0 may undergo ppisn means that ppisn should be considered as a possible candidate mechanism for the lbv mass loss phenomenon in some circumstances .",
    "it would be worthwhile to explore the ppisn process in stars with a variety of envelope compositions and structures , including those that are nearly pure , bare , oxygen cores to understand how ppisn may lead to single or multiple shell - ejection phases .",
    "we thank the mesa team for making this valuable tool readily available and especially thank bill paxton for his ready advice and council in running the code .",
