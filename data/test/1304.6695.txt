    "at current and future neutron facilities , like the research reactor frm - ii  @xcite , or the european spallation source ess  @xcite , small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) will obtain a major improvement by the much higher neutron fluxes than previously delivered .",
    "this leads to an intensity gain of at least one order of magnitude for sans instruments , allowing a more detailed study of complex structures and fast processes . to cope with these expected high intensities",
    "the new detector readout system system judidt  @xcite was developed for the sans - diffractometer kws1 at the previously active research reactor frj-2 of the forschungszentrum jlich , germany .",
    "the system was then modified for a later use at the kws2 experiment at frm - ii . within the fp7/nmi3  @xcite european - founded project",
    "it was proposed to use the judidt readout electronics for the data acquisition of a novel anger camera prototype  @xcite , being able to cope with counting rates of several hundred kilohertz .",
    "some modifications were implemented to properly handle the signal generated by the scintillating light in the @xmath0 volume gas .",
    "the proposed prototype underwent a full series of measurements at several neutron test - beam facilities in europe , showing the capability to cope with the high demanding performance  @xcite . in this paper the results of the characterization of the stand - alone electronics are presented and commented . in addition , the data acquisition with the entire system detector plus the judidt readout system will be described and the corresponding results discussed .",
    "to cope with the high rates provided by the modern neutron beam facilities , the zea-2 institute at fzj , has developed the readout system judidt ( jlicher digitales detektor auslesssystem ) .",
    "the design of the electronics comprises a fast signal and data processing by usage of modern technologies like field - programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) .",
    "a detailed description of the electronics can be found in  @xcite .",
    "here we address only its main features : the front - head is equipped with lemo @xmath2 ohm connectors to handle up to @xmath3 pre - amplified signals . according to the selected capacitor on the integrator stage the amplifier",
    ", different gain can be obtained .",
    "the signal leaves the main amplification and shaping stage with a decay time typically of @xmath4 ns , and is then feeded to its dedicated 12-bit adc in the board , fig .",
    "[ fig : judidt_schematics ] .",
    "each fpga handles four input channels and stores in a circular buffer the values provided by the individual adcs , which sample their corresponding signal at a rate of @xmath5 mhz ( every @xmath6 ns ) .",
    "as soon as a maximum in one channel is found , then the amplitude is evaluated also for the other channels in a selectable time window enclosing the measured peaking time . in the main fpga",
    "register several cuts can be set to select events in specific amplitude and time windows .",
    "the setting of the fpga is performed via api functions provided by the driver developers .",
    "the @xmath7 bit adc ( ad9236 ) covers an amplitude range from zero up to two volts with an adc resolution of @xmath8 mv per adc unit . the data in the upper half of the adc dynamic range ( @xmath9 bits ) are then shipped to an external computer through a @xmath10 gbyte optical link using only @xmath11 bits , thus deteriorating the signal resolution down to @xmath12 mv .",
    "considering that the main amplification stage is configured to provide a gain factor of ten results an overall resolution measured by the analyzer of @xmath13 mv per adc unit .",
    "the characterization measurements of the judidt electronics were performed at the laboratories in zea-2 , the typical setup of the test - bench is shown in fig .  [",

    "( bnc by berkeley nucleonics corp . )",
    "provides a tailed pulse with negative polarity for different selectable values of pulse rate and with variable amplitude .",
    "additionally , a device by tennelec was used to provide selectable attenuator factors to the voltage tailed signal .",
    "the attenuated signal is then injected in one of the @xmath3 input channels of the investigated board , and the processed output signal ( e.g. , the measured peaking amplitude ) is saved in a binary file on hard disk , using the dedicated data acquisition software developed for the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the data acquisition is driven from a windows xp machine connected to the lvds - bus based crate ( develped at zea-2 ) via a sis1100 gbit optical link interface on both sides of the link .",
    "the daq can be easily ported to a linux system , being the software cross - platform build .",
    "the electronics performance has been also investigated using it as readout system for the anger camera prototype  @xcite , using @xmath14 neutron sources in the zea-2 laboratory .",
    "the readout system has a very low intrinsic noise . due to this optimal feature",
    "the pedestal distribution in each channel appears like a delta function at one or seldomly two adc units . in this scenario",
    "it is difficult to reliably estimate the system noise as the root mean squared of the pedestal distribution .",
    "a possible solution is to couple one input channel to the negative unipolar output of an amplifier . here",
    ", we have used the amplifier ortec @xmath15 .",
    "different gain factors were applied in order to make the pedestal distribution broader , thus covering as many adc channels as possible .",
    "it is clear that while coupling an amplifier to the readout electronics the measured noise is somehow the convolution of the noise arising from both systems , and can likely provide only an upper limit estimation .",
    "an example of our procedure is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] , where the pedestal of the same channel is shown in different configurations for the amplifier . at the largest gain used , the distribution is well gaussian and covers many adc channels , with a spread of 1.98 adc units , resulting in a negligible noise level .",
    "the peaking amplitude of the input signal can be measured differently by the @xmath3 independent channels of a board .",
    "this effect is due by the different intrinsic pedestal offset of each channel , and by a possible gain mismatch of the individual amplification channels .",
    "an example of this bias is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signalvsch ] , resulting in an effective covered dynamic range not equivalent for all the @xmath3 adc channels .",
    "this feature can be cured by changing the baseline offset which can be modified by the data acquisition software tuning the dac at the end of the amplifying stage , fig .",
    "[ fig : judidt_schematics ] .",
    "the effect of the baseline correction is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pedestalspread ] .",
    "the gain mismatch in the amplifying stage and/or in the voltage setting of the photomultiplier can be recovered instead by gain - matching procedures , as the technique described in sec .",

    "in a multi - channel readout system it is important to verify that the signal cross - talk between the individual channels remains at a negligible level . here",
    "the investigation of the cross - talk is done performing a wider scan of injected charge in a single channel . while increasing the injected charge in several steps up to the maximum adc value , the signal , that is the pedestal , of the remaining channels is measured and monitored for variations .",
    "an example of the performed measurements is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosstalk ] .",
    "the measured pedestal is presented for all channels while in the channel @xmath16 the charge was injected with different amplitude values . in the neighboring lines",
    "the measured signal appears to remain well within one adc unit .",
    "the pedestal is measured in the remaining channels of the module.,height=283 ]    an attempt to estimate a possible variation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosstalkfit ] , where for each channel a two - parameter linear fit is performed in the analyzed input signal range , confirming a negligible charge leakage between the channels .",
    "a small trend is possibly visible in channel @xmath17 , which is processed by the same fpga of the channel @xmath16 , where the signal was injected .",
    "conservately , for each data point the uncertainty was taken as being half of the adc bin size .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the narrow pedestal distribution , which is typically well within one adc unit .",
    "during data taking the dynamic range of the adc should linearly cover the entire possible energy range deposited by the impinging neutrons . in the anger camera the scintillating light",
    "is initially generated during the drift of the generated electron cloud in the gas volume and then in the amplification stage of the micro - strip . at the exit window of the camera",
    "the light is collected by a set of vacuum photomultipliers ( four pmts in the prototype used at fzj ) , and converted in a current signal .",
    "the amplitude of the signal depends eventually on several factors as the tension applied to the micros - trip , to the drift field , and to the photomultipliers , and the amplifying stage of the judidt electronics , which is set to ten for this type of experiment .",
    "the electronics gain can be eventually changed in order to cover the dynamic range allowed by the investigated physics process .",
    "this can be achieved by using a proper capacitor in the main amplification stage .",
    "special care should be taken to the preamplifier configuration to fit the characteristic of both the incoming signal from the pmts and of the judidt amplifying stage .",
    "an input signal of @xmath18 mv can already saturate the amplifier , when the device is configured for a gain of factor ten , ( as verified directly on the board by a scope ) .",
    "the linearity of the system response was tested with the laboratory data acquisition system and using a negative tailed pulse at different amplitude values .",
    "the minimum injected voltage was the reference point of the measurement , and was extracted at the oscilloscope after maximally attenuating the signal with the tennelec device .",
    "this device offers several combinations of attenuating values by properly activating the several switches available in the device .",
    "by de - selecting those switches a larger amplitude could be injected in the readout electronics without modifying the setting of the pulse generator .",
    "an example of this measurement is presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : linearity ] for tailed pulses with @xmath19 @xmath20s decaying time .",
    "a linear fit to the experimental data is performed ; for each measurement setup a gaussian distribution is generated , and the uncertainty on the mean value is calculated , following  @xcite , as @xmath21 .",
    "the residuals to the linearity are calculated dividing the deviation of the measured experimental points from the linear fit results over the fit values .",
    "the results are presented as percent in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : linearity ] , showing a linearity well stable within @xmath22 within the statistical uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "it should be noted that by using an analogue pulse generator the minimum injected voltage ( our reference ) could not be measured with enough precision .",
    "this could possibly affects the extraction of the fit slope , but not any conclusion about the linearity of the system , being the larger input voltage points determined by rescaling the measured reference point using the switches of the tennelec device .",
    "the system appears therefore reasonably linear , while keeping the input signal below the saturation region of the main amplifying stage , above mentioned .",
    "the gain of factor @xmath19 of the electronics was verified directly on the board before the adc stage via a high - impedance scope .",
    "although great care is taken in the design a construction of each independent channel to have the same signal processing , eventually slight differences in the gain are observed , as shown in tab .",

    "it is clear that following this technique no statistical poisson fluctuation in the flux can be observed , as instead is expected in a reactor beam .",

    "the points at large rate values show larger uncertainty , which can be temptatively understood as given by the not sufficiently small timestamp granularity . superimposed to the points",
    "is shown a linear fit , whose slope appears to be driven downwards by the high rate points , possibly due to the fact that the multi - purpose daq developed in the laboratory is not yet optimized for this specific measurement .",
    "the peaking rate values , superimposed in the plots , are typically larger than the mean efficiency values , thus supporting this scenario .",
    "it is additional interesting to investigate also how homogeneous is the data accumulation rate of the electronics with respect to the amplitude of the incoming signal .",
    "this feature was studied by injecting a tailed signal with varying amplitude and fixed pulse rate while measuring the rates with the laboratory daq system .",

    "in order to correct for the above mentioned gain mismatch among the different readout channels in the system , comprising the photomultipliers and the amplifying electronics , a blue light led system has been implemented to equalize the response of all pmts .",

    "blue light is emitted by energizing the led with a positive voltage pulse with a width and amplitude of approximately @xmath30 ns and @xmath31 v. the emitted light does not reach directly the photocathodes , but can reach them only upon isotropic backward reflexion on the chamber window , thus allowing for a reasonably uniform illumination of the photomultiplier photocathodes . when properly tuning the high voltage value of the individual pmts , the corresponding signal distributions can be acquired with similar mean values and width ( rms ) , recovering any possible initial gain mismatch of the different channels of the system .",

    "it should be also mentioned that this procedure to gain - match the readout channel should be , in principle , re - done whenever the system is modified ( e.g. after the replacement of a photomultiplier , of a voltage divider , after the change of the pre - amplifier configuration , and so on ) .",

    "the photomultipliers pmt1 to pmt4 are located anticlock - wise starting from the top - right corner of the holding frame .",
    "more sophisticated methods are available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to stress that this led system could be used ( with a slight modification of the daq software ) to automatically monitor online any gain change ( both long and short - term ) providing the user a way to promptly act to correct for the observed gain mismatch and avoiding a bias of the measurement .",

    "the drawback of this flexible configuration is that the coverage of the amplifying micro - strip by any of the four photomultipliers can be different according to the orientation of the mask supporting the pmts in the aluminum case , thus possibly biasing the measurement of the neutron impinging point .",

    "<S> the detector is a chamber filled with @xmath0+@xmath1 gas for neutron capture and subsequent production of a tritium and a proton . </S>",
    "<S> the energy deposition by the ions gives rise to drifting electrons with an avalanche amplification as they approach a micro - strip anode structure . </S>",
    "<S> the scintillating light , generated during the electron drift and avalanche stage , is collected by four vacuum photomultipliers . </S>",
    "<S> the position reconstruction is performed via software algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> the judidt readout electronics was modified at zea-2 to cope with the data acquisition requirements of the prototype . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the commissioning of the electronics are here presented and commented .     </S>",
    "<S> forschungszentrum jlich + internal report no </S>",
