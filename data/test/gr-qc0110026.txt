    "general relativity can be quantised by canonical or covariant methods depending on whether one regards space or space - time as more fundamental .",
    "because of the incomplete nature of the subject the relation between the two approaches is not entirely clear , even though one expects that in appropriate circumstances they should be equivalent .",
    "the broad aim of this paper is to contribute to this discussion .",
    "general relativity is a completely constrained system and hence quantum gravity distinguishes itself from ordinary field theory in that the hamiltonian vanishes weakly .",
    "this implies for a canonical formalism that there is no propagator , since there is no external time variable with respect to which it could be defined .",
    "instead the central object is the generalised projector onto the solution space of the hamiltonian constraint @xmath1 .",
    "formally , this projector can be written as : @xmath2 e^{-i\\int_\\sigma d^nx { \\hat{h}}(x)t(x)},\\ ] ] where @xmath3 $ ] is a measure on the space of scalar fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a spatial slice of dimension @xmath6 of the space - time manifold @xmath7",
    ". this operator then defines the physical hilbert space of the theory , from which we have to extract all physical predictions by the construction of suitable observables .",
    "this projector can be expressed as a phase space path integral in an analogous way as is done for the propagator in ordinary field theory .",
    "hence , we expect this projector to be the link between the above canonical description and covariant approaches to the quantisation of gravity .    indeed , the starting point for the covariant approach is the expression @xmath8e^{-is[{\\bf g}]}\\ ] ] which describes a sum over all space - time geometries @xmath9 on the cylinder @xmath10 $ ] with boundary geometries @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". two promising approaches towards making sense of this expression are the dynamical triangulation and the spin - foam models .",
    "these have in common that they they replace the above sum over geometries by a sum over space - time triangulations .",
    "the aim of this paper will be to show that the projector @xmath13 can be suitably regularised so that it describes a sum over space - time triangulations .",
    "more precisely , we will be discussing canonical theories of quantum gravity that have a hilbert space of kinematical states @xmath14 given by triangulations or dual graphs of the spatial slice @xmath5 .",
    "we will provide two different regularisations of the projector such that its matrix elements @xmath15 are given by a sum over triangulations of the cylinder @xmath10 $ ] , with boundary triangulations @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the amplitudes of the triangulations will be given by the dynamical triangulation and spin - foam models respectively .",
    "the idea will be to decompose the projector into a product of `` small '' unitary local proper time evolutions .",
    "acting on an initial triangulation @xmath14 each elementary evolution corresponds to a gluing of an @xmath18-dimensional simplex to the boundary . in this way",
    "we build up a sum over space - time triangulations with the correct amplitude .",
    "this link between canonical and covariant theories is important for the understanding of the dynamics of these quantum gravity models and for providing a space - time picture in the canonical framework .",
    "ultimately , one would like to relate a given hamiltonian to the amplitude of a corresponding covariant model .",
    "as we will see this can be achieved in the simplest case of 1 + 1 dynamical triangulations .",
    "the discussion of spin foam models of quantum gravity and the closely related topological @xmath0 theories , will clarify their relation to canonical loop quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , we will see that elementary moves of spin - networks , which were thought to describe the action of the hamiltonian constraint , are in fact related to time - evolutions . a better understanding of this relation should help in deciding which of the current proposals for spin foam models provides a correct description of quantum gravity and also shed light on the nature of the hamiltonian constraint of loop quantum gravity .",
    "this work builds on a previous attempt to derive a spin foam model from 3 + 1 loop quantum gravity by reisenberger and rovelli  @xcite , which was developed further by rovelli in  @xcite .",
    "our approach will differ in the regularisation of the projector .",
    "we will see in this paper how this leads to many attractive features :    * by providing two different regularisations we can describe both the spin - foam and the dynamical triangulation models .",
    "* our expansions are closely related to the derivation of the path integral in quantum mechanics and field theory . *",
    "they provide a clear role for the @xmath3 $ ] integration over scalar ( lapse ) functions in the projector and avoid infinities due to this integration . *",
    "they provide a very natural interpretation of the addition of space - time simplices as local proper time evolutions . *",
    "they avoid over counting of space - time triangulations . *",
    "we obtain an understanding of the continuum limit of spin - foam models .",
    "* most importantly one can show that in @xmath0 theories and 2 + 1 loop quantum gravity the addition of tetrahedra , when viewed as an operation on physical states , leaves these invariant .",
    "this suggests that these actions should be viewed as evolutions and not actions of the hamiltonian constraint operator . *",
    "in addition , in 1 + 1 dynamical triangulation we can show explicitly how we can derive the correct hamiltonian operator from the covariant model via our expansion of the projector .",
    "we begin our discussion by describing the formal relation between the projector and path integrals for quantum gravity .",
    "this will be made concrete in the dynamical triangulations framework focusing on 1 + 1 dimensions , where results can be stated most explicitly and simply .",
    "we then continue to generalise our results to higher dimensions before moving on to consider spin - foam models and loop quantum gravity .",
    "in this section we describe the generalised projector and show how it is formally related to a sum over geometries .",
    "we will find that canonical and covariant quantum gravity are equivalent up to the choice of range in the integration over lapse functions .",
    "the canonical description of general relativity requires that we restrict our attention to space - time manifolds @xmath19 that allow a split into space and time , i.e.  manifolds diffeomorphic to @xmath20 . here and in the following @xmath5",
    "will denote the @xmath6-dimensional spatial slice , which we will take to be compact .",
    "general relativity is a completely constrained system , i.e.  the hamiltonian for the theory vanishes weakly .",
    "this can be viewed as a consequence of diffeomorphism invariance and the absence of an external time parameter .",
    "hence quantisation follows the dirac prescription which requires that we quantise the unconstrained classical system and impose the constraints as quantum operators on an initial , _ kinematical _ , hilbert space @xmath21 . loosely speaking",
    ", the constraints implement the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory .",
    "typically , we distinguish between the `` momentum '' constraints @xmath22 , which generate diffeomorphisms of the spatial slice @xmath5 and the `` hamiltonian '' constraint @xmath23 , which is responsible for diffeomorphisms normal to the spatial slice and is hence associated with dynamics .",
    "if connection instead of metric variables are used in the coordinatisation of the phase space there will be additional `` gauss '' constraints , enforcing invariance under internal gauge transformations corresponding to the rotation of tetrads .",
    "physical states lie in the kernel of the constraint operators .",
    "if this space is non - trivial and can be endowed with an inner product , we obtain the final _ physical _ hilbert space @xmath24 . note the absence of a hamiltonian operator on @xmath24 , resulting in the the lack of a notion of evolution or propagator .",
    "states are interpreted as entire histories , which makes the extraction of physical information from this frozen picture highly problematic .",
    "these conceptual matters will not concern us . instead we need to face the following technical issue related to our problem of constructing a path integral for general relativity . whenever 0 lies in the continuous part of the spectrum of one of the constraint operators",
    ", the corresponding eigenvectors will not be normalisable .",
    "hence the construction of the physical hilbert space is non - trivial and proceeds by the so - called refined algebraic quantisation ( raq ) procedure ( see  @xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "the idea is to look for distributional solutions to the constraints , i.e.functionals on the kinematical state space .",
    "the solutions are precisely those functionals that are constant on the orbits of the unitary action generated by the constraints .",
    "equivalently we could be view the orbits themselves as the generalised solutions . the key step is to define an inner product on these physical states , which is done by introducing a generalised projector @xmath25 .",
    "this is a map from @xmath21 onto the space of functionals , which maps a vector to its orbit under the constraint action .",
    "the image of the map @xmath25 will be referred to as the solution space of the constraints .",
    "let us denote physical states by a tilde , i.e.  @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , then the physical inner product is given by : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where the right hand side denotes the action of the functional @xmath30 on the kinematical state @xmath31 .",
    "in many cases @xmath25 can be constructed by the method of group averaging . in this case",
    "we have : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the group action generated by the constraint under consideration and @xmath34 is a suitable measure on the group .",
    "we have also made use of the kinematical inner product @xmath35 on @xmath21 .",
    "completion of the solution space with respect to the physical inner product gives us the physical hilbert space @xmath24 .",
    "the operator @xmath13 defined above is called the generalised projection operator since it reduces to an ordinary projection onto the kernel of the constraints if the corresponding group action is compact .",
    "but the power of the approach lies in the fact that it can be applied in other cases also , in fact whenever the above integral converges , group averaging defines the unique generalised projector  @xcite .    when applied to the momentum and gauss constraints the above procedure",
    "is implemented simply , by demanding that states are invariant under the action of spatial diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint , however , causes difficulties since it generates diffeomorphisms which are normal to the spatial slice and hence does not have a simple geometrical action on kinematical states .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian constraint is related to evolution in coordinate time hence we expect the projector corresponding to @xmath23 to be related to the propagator in field theory .",
    "this is what we explore in the following .    in analogy to the group",
    "averaging procedure we can write down a formal expression for the generalised projection operator corresponding to the hamiltonian constraint operator @xmath1 : @xmath36 e^{-i{\\hat{h}}[t]},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 : = \\int_\\sigma d^nx { \\hat{h}}(x)t(x)$ ] . here",
    "@xmath3 $ ] denotes a measure on the space of scalar functions @xmath4 , which we leave unspecified .",
    "the integral should be understood as an integral over the generators of the algebra generated by @xmath1 .",
    "since the exponential @xmath38)$ ] is linear in @xmath4 , the above can also be viewed as a expression of a product of delta functions imposing the constraint @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "alternatively , we can understand the above in the following way .",
    "the expression @xmath40}\\phi \\rangle}_{kin}}$ ] defines the `` propagator '' in multi - fingered proper time @xmath4 between two kinematical states @xmath31 and @xmath41 , which describes geometries on the boundaries of the cylinder @xmath42 \\times \\sigma$ ] . since",
    "physical results should be independent of the arbitrary proper time separation between initial and final splices , we should integrate over all possible @xmath4 .",
    "this then defines the above projector . a more in depth discussion",
    "is given in  @xcite .",
    "we will now show in more detail how the projector and the path integral for quantum gravity are related .",
    "the projector can be expressed as a phase space path integral as is demonstrated by klauder  @xcite for general constrained systems .",
    "this phase space integral can also be derived from a sum over geometries approach to quantum gravity , as has been investigated in detail by teitelboim  @xcite , forging the link between covariant and canonical frameworks .",
    "let us denote the points in the phase space of general relativity as @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 and let us furthermore assume we have eigenstates @xmath45 of the corresponding configuration operators .",
    "we can then express the physical inner product : @xmath46 { \\langle q_1 | } e^{-i{\\hat{h}}[t ] } { | q_0 \\rangle}\\ ] ] as a path integral in complete analogy with the derivation of the path integral in elementary quantum mechanics . more concretely",
    ", we imagine that the operator @xmath38)$ ] is evolving between a state describing an initial geometry at coordinate time 0 and a final geometry at coordinate time 1 .",
    "we then write : @xmath47 } = \\lim_{{\\epsilon}{\\rightarrow}0 } \\prod_{k=1}^n e^{-i{\\epsilon}{\\hat{h}}[t]},\\ ] ] with @xmath48 .",
    "then using the standard techniques we obtain formally : @xmath49 \\int_{q_0}^{q_1 } [ dp][dq ] e^{i\\int_0 ^ 1 dt\\int d^nx ( p(x)_t\\dot{q}(x)_t -    h(p , q ) t(x))}\\ ] ] the expression on the right is an integral over all paths in phase space @xmath50 \\hspace{1 cm } t \\in [ 0,1]\\ ] ] with fixed initial and final configurations @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the measure @xmath53 : = \\prod_{t=0}^1 [ dq(x)]$ ] is a product of suitably normalised measures @xmath54 $ ] on the space of functions @xmath55 with a similar expression for @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this is the expression that is obtained if we start from a sum over histories approach to quantum gravity modulo ambiguities concerning the integration range in the @xmath57 $ ] integral .",
    "there one is interested in defining the quantity : @xmath58 e^{-is[{\\bf g}]}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the action for general relativity .",
    "the integral is over all space - time geometries @xmath60 that interpolate between initial and final geometries @xmath61 on the boundary of the cylinder @xmath42 \\times \\sigma$ ] . by a geometry",
    "we mean an equivalence classes of metrics under diffeomorphisms .",
    "this sum over geometries can be reexpressed as a phase space path integral . in metric variables",
    "the phase space coordinates are given by the metrics @xmath62 on the slice @xmath5 and their conjugate momenta @xmath63 .    by choosing a foliation of the space - time cylinder we can rewrite the gravitational action in hamiltonian form .",
    "the action is then a function of the paths @xmath64 $ ] , where the pair @xmath65 $ ] describes the geometry of the spatial slice @xmath66 @xmath67 = \\int_{0}^{1 } dt \\int_\\sigma d^n x(p^{ik}\\dot{g}_{ik}- n(x , t)h(g_{ik},p^{ik } ) - n^i(x , t)h_i(g_{ik},p^{ik}))\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the lapse and shift functions which encode the information on how the foliation of space - time is chosen .",
    "the constraints generate gauge transformations that relate physically indistinguishable variables . hence , to avoid multiple counting of equivalent paths in the integral  ( [ soh ] ) we need to fix a gauge .",
    "one of the simplest possible gauge choices , as described by teitelboim  @xcite , is the proper time gauge @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "these conditions fix the available freedom up to diffeomorphisms of the initial or final slices .",
    "hence one can rewrite the integral  ( [ soh ] ) as an integral over paths in phase space with initial and final _ geometries _ @xmath72 and @xmath73 kept fixed : @xmath74 \\prod_{t=0}^1[dp^{ik}(x , t)][dg_{ik}(x , t)]e^{i\\int_0 ^ 1 dt \\int_\\sigma d^n x(p^{ik}\\dot{g}_{ik}- t(x)h(g_{ik},p^{ik}))}\\ ] ] where the integral is over the functions @xmath75 , which give the multi - fingered proper time separation between initial and final spatial slices .",
    "this integral has the same form as the one derived from the canonical projector in equation  ( [ pro - soh ] ) .",
    "note however , that the integration measures need to be chosen in such a way that the above integral becomes independent on our choice of gauge , otherwise one needs to include ghosts terms in the above action as described by teitelboim  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , by choosing the appropriate measures klauder has derived the above directly , without the prior imposition of the gauge conditions  @xcite .",
    "we will not be concerned with these issues as the measures will be implicitly determined by the choice of models considered later , which provide concrete realisations of the formal path - integral expressions given in this section .",
    "we are interested in the range of integration of the @xmath3 $ ] integral which we have left unspecified and which is responsible for a subtlety in the relation between canonical and covariant approaches .",
    "first we note that in order for the lapse function to arise from a well defined foliation it is necessary that @xmath76 for all @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath4 is a continuous function this implies that @xmath4 is either entirely positive or entirely negative .",
    "if the integral  ( [ soh2 ] ) is to project onto the kernel of the hamiltonian constraint and be equivalent to the expression  ( [ pro - soh ] ) then we need integrate over both positive and negative lapse functions , as is clear from the analogy between the projector and a product of delta functions .",
    "however , if we want the phase space integral  ( [ soh2 ] ) to be equivalent to the sum over geometries integral  ( [ soh ] ) , then we should only integrate over half of the allowed @xmath4 , say only those for which @xmath78 . to see this",
    "we recall that that the function @xmath4 encodes how the space - time manifold @xmath19 is foliated as @xmath42 \\times \\sigma$ ] . in equation  ( [ soh2 ] )",
    "we are integrating over the variables @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath4 determines how the 3-metric on each slice @xmath80 and their conjugate momenta are glued together to give a space - time metric on @xmath19 .",
    "however , a change in sign of the proper time @xmath4 simply corresponds to reversing the foliation of @xmath19 and hence @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] will describe equivalent space - time metrics .",
    "this symmetry is not enforced by the constraints as they only identify configurations that can be related by infinitesimal deformations .",
    "hence the sum over geometries expression is not exactly equivalent to the phase space integral derived from the canonical picture due to a larger symmetry group in the sum over geometries case .",
    "this is reflected in the range of integration in the integral  ( [ soh2 ] ) .",
    "this feature can be seen clearly in the discussion of the relativistic particle , which can be viewed as general relativity in 0 + 1 dimensions .",
    "if we choose the half infinite range of integration then the phase space path integral will define the feynman propagator ( an in depth discussion of the different greens functions that can be obtained in this approach is given by halliwell and ortiz in  @xcite ) .",
    "this is the same result that is obtained if we try to define the sum over geometries integral , which is just a function of the length of the particle trajectory .",
    "one approach to do this is to use a dynamical triangulations approach in the euclidean regime and then wick rotate the result , which gives us precisely the feynman propagator .",
    "let us summarise .",
    "we have seen that @xmath13 defined in equation  ( [ projector ] ) is an important operator for canonical quantum gravity .",
    "it has two interpretations depending on the @xmath4 integration range :    1 .   for the full integration range",
    "we obtain the projector onto the kernel of the hamiltonian constraint ; 2 .   for the half - infinite integration range @xmath13",
    "is related to the sum over geometries .    in either case",
    "@xmath13 can be described by a path integral .    in the following",
    "we will show how this can be made concrete by discussing first the dynamical triangulations and second the spin - foam model of quantum gravity .",
    "the former gives a definition of a sum over geometries whereas the latter is a path - integral definition of the projector .",
    "we will see how these descriptions can be recovered from two respective regularisations of @xmath13 defined on the appropriate kinematical hilbert spaces .",
    "the dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity attempts to regularise and define the path integral given by equation  ( [ soh ] ) ( c.f .",
    "@xcite for details and references ) .",
    "the idea is to work with manifestly diffeomorphism invariant quantities and thus avoid difficulties concerning gauge fixing .",
    "this is achieved by replacing the smooth space - time metric manifold by a simplicial manifold constructed from _ equilateral _ ( n+1)-dimensional simplices of geodesic edge length @xmath82 . here and in the following we will be working with riemannian metrics .",
    "a lorentzian framework for dynamical triangulations exists  @xcite but for our purposes the riemannian case will suffice to exemplify all the features of our construction .",
    "we are approximating the sum over geometries by a sum over triangulations of the space - time manifold .",
    "the weight of each triangulation is given by the euclidean regge action , which can be expressed solely as a function of the squared edge lengths .",
    "but note that in contrast to regge calculus we are keeping the edge lengths fixed  triangulations differ only by the connectivity of the simplices .",
    "the challenge is to find a non - trivial continuum limit of this statistical model by taking @xmath83 , and appropriately rescaling the bare newton and cosmological constants .",
    "this works well in 1 + 1 dimensions , where one can recover results from standard liouville theory . in higher dimensions evidence for",
    "a interesting continuum limit is still lacking .",
    "our goal is to show how the sum over triangulations can be recovered from a canonical theory via an expansion of the projector defined in equation  ( [ projector ] ) .",
    "we assume again that space - time is of the form @xmath84 .",
    "the kinematical hilbert @xmath21 space for our theory is constructed from the free vector space generated by all equilateral triangulations @xmath14 of @xmath5 . by identifying the edges as geodesics of length @xmath82",
    "we can interpret states as piecewise - linear geometries .",
    "we will distinguish between auxiliary and kinematical states .",
    "auxiliary states are actual embedded triangulations of @xmath5 , whereas kinematical states are equivalence classes of auxiliary states under diffeomorphisms , i.e.  we can think of them as non - embedded or abstract triangulations which are simplicial manifolds with the topology of @xmath5 .",
    "an inner product is specified on the space of triangulations by demanding that inequivalent triangulations are orthogonal i.e. : @xmath85 completion of the space of kinematical triangulations with respect to this inner product gives us @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in the projector @xmath13 acting on this space . from the discussion in the last section we know that @xmath13 is related to the sum over geometries , which in the dynamical triangulation approach is given by @xmath86}\\ ] ] which denotes the sum over all space - time triangulations @xmath87 with boundaries @xmath16 and @xmath17 weighted by the exponential of the regge action @xmath88 $ ] . in particular , we expect that by restricting the integration range in the projector we should have : @xmath89_+ { \\langle { \\vartriangle}_1 |}e^{-{\\hat{h}}_a[t ] } { | { \\vartriangle}_0 \\rangle } = z_a({\\vartriangle}_1,{\\vartriangle}_0)\\ ] ] where @xmath3_+$ ] denotes an integration over positive proper - time functions only ) does not define the physical inner product . ] .",
    "note that because we are doing a riemannian calculation we are using real amplitudes .",
    "we now show how this can be demonstrated by choosing a suitable regularisation of the projector      let us consider the projector with half - infinite integration range @xmath90_+ e^{-\\int d^n x t(x ) { \\hat{h}}(x)}\\\\ & = & \\int_0^\\infty dv \\int[dt(x)]_+ \\delta\\left[\\int d^nx t(x ) = v \\right ] e^{-\\int d^nx t(x ) { \\hat{h}}(x)}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the dimension of @xmath91 is naturally that of space - time volume .",
    "hence we are splitting the sum over all geometries into a sum over geometries with fixed volume and then summing over all possible volumes .",
    "to regularise the functional integral , we allow the function @xmath4 to only take values in discrete steps of @xmath92 .",
    "in other words @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "we also write the spatial integrals as riemann sums . to do this we assume that we have given some metric on @xmath5 with respect to which we can define a square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath95 .",
    "we will denote the set of vertices of this lattice by @xmath96 .",
    "this gives us a regulated projector @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98_{\\epsilon}\\delta \\left [ l^n{\\epsilon}\\sum_{x \\in v } t(x ) = v \\right ] e^{-\\sum_{x \\in v } { \\epsilon}l^n t(x){\\hat{h}}(x)}\\\\ & = & \\sum_{s=0}^\\infty \\int [ dt]_{\\epsilon}\\delta\\left[\\sum_{x \\in v } t(x ) = s \\right ] \\prod_{x \\in v } \\prod_{k=0}^{t(x ) } e^{-{\\epsilon}l^n { \\hat{h}}(x)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57_{\\epsilon}$ ] denotes a measure on the positive discretised lapse functions .",
    "let us set @xmath99 one can see that the above delta function imposes the condition that the product @xmath100 has exactly @xmath101 factors .",
    "the integral over the discretised lapse function then ensures that for fixed @xmath101 we sum over all possible @xmath102 satisfying the constraint .",
    "more precisely we have : @xmath103 where the second sum is over all possible _ ordered _",
    "@xmath101-tuples @xmath104 .",
    "the ordering arises in the replacement of the spatial integrals by riemann sums .",
    "for example , in ( 1 + 1)d the ordering implies that @xmath105 .",
    "the continuum projector is recovered in the limits @xmath106 , whereby we need to check that the results are independent of the lattice chosen in the regularisation .    in the following",
    "we will see that this expansion allows a very natural interpretation .",
    "the operator @xmath107 will correspond to a local evolution of a state in proper time @xmath92 , which will be identified with the addition of a space - time simplex to the boundary triangulation . in this way",
    "the above sum will correspond to a sum over triangulations of space - time with the number of tetrahedra in a particular triangulation given by @xmath101 . in the next sections we will discuss this in detail in the context of 1 + 1 dimensions .      in 1 + 1 dimensions the action for general relativity is proportional to the volume of space - time : @xmath108 = \\lambda \\int_{\\mathcal{m}}\\sqrt{-\\det \\mathbf{g}}$ ] , where @xmath109 denotes the cosmological constant . in the following we will be approximating the sum over geometries by a sum over triangulations of the cylinder @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "space - time simplices are simply triangles with area proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "hence the transition amplitude between two boundary states @xmath16 and @xmath17 is : @xmath112 where the sum is over space - time triangulations @xmath87 with the appropriate boundaries , and @xmath113 is the number of triangles in @xmath87 .",
    "auxiliary states correspond to triangulations of @xmath114 and are thus an embedded sequence of links .",
    "they can be characterised by the coordinates @xmath115 of the vertices between the links , i.e. they are of the form @xmath116 , where @xmath6 is the number of links .",
    "since the only diffeomorphism invariant information contained in the auxiliary states is the number of links , kinematical states can be though of an abstract chain of links denoted by @xmath117 .",
    "these are the sates spanning @xmath21 .",
    "the aim is to find a to find a definition of @xmath107 acting on @xmath21 such that as @xmath118 we can express @xmath119 as a sum over triangulations with the correct weights . in other words",
    "we would like to deduce the appropriate quantisation of the evolution @xmath120 from the path integral form of the theory . to do this we will identify the action of the operator @xmath107 with the stacking of triangles .",
    "there are two ways to add triangles to a sequence of links @xmath117 .",
    "we can glue one or two faces of the triangle to the boundary .",
    "this creates a new set of links @xmath121 or @xmath122 respectively .",
    "roughly , we will define @xmath107 to be the sum of both these local actions as shown in figure  [ action ] .",
    "repeated action of @xmath123 will then create a triangulation .",
    "an important aspect of this identification ( which is unique to the dynamical triangulations framework ) is that the parameter @xmath82 in our model can be interpreted as a proper time distance .",
    "hence it is natural to identify @xmath82 with @xmath92 , as we will do in the following .",
    "these ideas can be expressed more precisely in the dual picture , which is also more likely to be useful in generalisations to higher dimensions and spin - foams . in general , the dual of a @xmath18-dimensional triangulation is an @xmath124-valent graph .",
    "the graph has a node in the centre of each simplex and one edge crossing each face as shown in figure  [ dual ] . in one dimension",
    "the dual of a triangulation is just a sequence of nodes .",

    "let us introduce creation and annihilation operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 acting on nodes of auxiliary dual states : @xmath132 @xmath133    this can be identified with the gluing of triangles as follows .",
    "the creation operator @xmath134 corresponds to the gluing of one edge of a triangle to a boundary link centred at @xmath135 .",
    "this gives a new boundary triangulation , which is identified with an auxiliary state by assigning the the node corresponding to right free edge of the added triangle with the coordinate @xmath135 and the left edge with @xmath136 as depicted on the left of figure  [ a ] .",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath137 acts by gluing two edges of a triangle to the boundary links @xmath135 and @xmath138 .",

    "the projector is given by a sum of ordered products @xmath140 as shown in equation  ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "in the ( 1 + 1)d case the ordering means that @xmath141 .",
    "this implies that an ordered product of evolution operators will construct triangles from right to left ( if the coordinate axis points left to right )",
    ".    the action of @xmath129 on a state @xmath142 will be @xmath143 whenever @xmath77 is not the coordinate of a node in @xmath142 .",
    "it follows that whenever the action of a product @xmath140 is non - zero it will act by constructing a sum of triangulations , each containing @xmath101 triangles .",

    "the amplitude for each triangulation is just @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the number of triangles in the triangulation as required .",
    "given two different auxiliary states representing the same kinematical state ( i.e.  having the same number of nodes ) , we can find two ordered sequences of operators that will produce the same abstract sum of triangulations when acting on the respective states .",
    "this is because the coordinates of the nodes just serve to label the links and their exact value is irrelevant for the geometrical interpretation of the action of @xmath129 .",
    "but as noted above , in the limit that @xmath118 , any triangulation that can be constructed by an ordered sequence of evolutions acting on a given auxiliary state , will be present in the expansion of @xmath144 .",
    "hence , in this limit , the amplitude becomes independent of the choice of representative for the state @xmath148 .",
    "for the same reason the amplitude also becomes independent of the metric chosen in the regularisation of @xmath144    to conclude we note that the triangulations constructed with the above definitions are unique , i.e.  two different sequences of operators @xmath140 acting on the same auxiliary state will give rise to different triangulations .",
    "this follows essentially from the ordering of the operators as shown in the appendix .",
    "however it is also clear that not all triangulations are produced c.f.figure  [ notposs ] .",
    "this is a feature of the choice of definition of @xmath129 .",

    "suggests that we are summing over geometries that suppress the creation of baby universes .    .",
    "this is because the top triangle has to be constructed after the bottom one .",
    "this can not happen since it is situated to the right .",
    "in other words we would need a sequence @xmath162 , which is not allowed since @xmath163.,height=96 ]",
    "one of the benefits of working in 1 + 1 dimensions is that we can use the definition of @xmath129 to derive the form of the continuum , averaged , hamiltonian constraint , thus completing the link between the covariant and canonical pictures .",
    "the hamiltonian and @xmath129 are related via : @xmath164 . in the following",
    "we will take the @xmath82 and @xmath95 limits simultaneously and hence set @xmath165 .",
    "thus for small @xmath82 we have : @xmath166 .",
    "let us define the averaged hamiltonian as : @xmath167 then @xmath168 where @xmath169 denotes the length of the spatial slice @xmath114 .",
    "the point is that the integrated evolution operator @xmath170 has a simple expression .",
    "it is the sum of the elementary evolution actions ( adding of a triangle in two possible ways ) on every node of a state @xmath117 .",
    "more specifically , the matrix elements of @xmath170 are given by @xmath171 the length @xmath172 also has a natural operator action . since the states @xmath117 describe geometries of length @xmath173 it follows that @xmath117 are volume eigenstates ,",
    "i.e. : @xmath174 hence from equations ( [ u - h ] ) , ( [ s ] ) and ( [ vol ] ) we learn that the matrix elements of the discretised averaged hamiltonian operator should be given by : @xmath175    the states @xmath117 describe geometries of length @xmath176 .",
    "we want to take the limit @xmath83 while keeping @xmath68 fixed . in this way",
    "we obtain a continuum hilbert space spanned by the states @xmath177 .",
    "we are looking for the continuum expression @xmath178 of @xmath179 which acts on this space i.e. we are interested in : @xmath180 since the discrete states @xmath181 , @xmath182 become increasingly better approximations to the continuum states @xmath177 and @xmath183 as @xmath83 , we can replace the above by : @xmath184 using the fact that @xmath185 and @xmath186 together with equation  ( [ discreteh ] ) we obtain @xmath187 expanding @xmath188 , @xmath189 to second order in @xmath82 and also expanding the exponential this gives @xmath190    hence we deduce @xmath191 this is the same expression ( up to a factor of 2 ) that has been obtained in the study of dynamical triangulation models  @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a choice of triangulation models in which baby universe creation is not allowed . here",
    "@xmath192 denotes a sum over sliced triangulations with @xmath193 slices as depicted in figure  [ slices ] ( see  @xcite for details ) . from our perspective",
    "it is clear why this should be so .",
    "we have @xmath194 = [ \\prod_{x \\in s^1 } { \\hat{u}}_a(x)]^t$ ] .",
    "hence the action of this operator corresponds to the stacking of @xmath193 layers of triangles to a boundary triangulation . ] .",
    "we have succeeded in deriving the form of the averaged hamiltonian constraint operator from the regularised path integral for 1 + 1 quantum gravity using our projector expansion .",
    "this hinged crucially on the identification of the elementary evolutions with the addition of triangles . moreover , this allowed us to naturally identify the small proper time step @xmath82 occurring in the regularisation of the projector with the edge length of the triangles .",
    "this gives rise to an interpretation to the integral over proper times @xmath3 $ ] as a sum over triangulations .",
    "these features are not present in the original regularisation of the projector proposed by reisenberger and rovelli  @xcite .",
    "they suggested an expansion of the exponential in the projector @xmath195",
    "\\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty } \\frac{(-{\\hat{h}}[t]^t)}{t!},\\ ] ] which as we will discuss later this was motivated by the form of the hamiltonian constraint in loop quantum gravity .",
    "in order for this expression to be interpretable as a sum over triangulations it turns out that we need to identify @xmath37 $ ] with the integrated move operator @xmath170 . in this way multiple action of the hamiltonian will produce all possible triangulations .",
    "this leaves the interpretation of the @xmath3 $ ] integral unclear since a sum over all triangulations is already generated for every function @xmath4 .",
    "intuitively , the proper time should be reflected in the triangulation .",
    "indeed in the dynamical triangulations approach it is clear that the proper time corresponds to the number of edges of triangles along a particular path .    additionally , a problem arises because there are many ways in which a given triangulation can be constructed by a sequence of stacking of triangles .",
    "all these possibilities will be included in the sum generated by the above expansion .",
    "this number is a non - trivial function of the triangulation and does not depend solely on @xmath196 , the number of triangles in the triangulation .",
    "hence the sum over triangulations will contain non - trivial symmetry factors that do not occur in the definition of @xmath197 .",
    "crucially , however , because one has made the identification @xmath198 = { \\hat{s}}_a$ ] it will no longer be possible to derive the correct expression for the continuum hamiltonian .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise our discussion to higher dimensions .",
    "space - time triangles will be replaced by @xmath18-simplices , where @xmath18 is the space - time dimension .",
    "these can be glued in @xmath199 ways to a given boundary triangulation , where @xmath200 is the number of faces of the simplex .",
    "these moves will be identified with the action of the local evolution operator and in this way we can again interpret the projector as a sum over triangulations .",
    "this is described in more detail for ( 2 + 1)d in the next section .",
    "however in higher dimensions boundary states no longer only depend on the number of boundary simplices but also their connectivity , which is related in a complicated way to the limiting continuum geometry of a discrete state .",
    "this makes it very difficult to derive the action of a hamiltonian differential operator .",
    "these issues are currently under investigation",
    "we will now discuss spin - foam models of @xmath0 theory and quantum gravity . in general ,",
    "a spin - foam is a 2-dimensional complex with faces labelled by representations and edges labelled by intertwining operators .",
    "these structures were first used in path - integrals for quantum gravity by reisenberger  @xcite and now provide a unifying framework for many approaches to quantum gravity ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for reviews and references ) .    in order to make contact with our discussion of dynamical triangulations",
    ", we will make use of the fact that the dual of a spin - foam is a triangulation of space - time with labelled edges .",
    "we will see how one can provide a definition of the projector ( not sum over geometries ) in terms of a sum over such space - time triangulations .",
    "in contrast to the dynamical triangulations framework , however , we also sum over the labellings of the edges in this approach .",
    "we will show how a new regularisation of the projector will lead naturally to this class of models",
    ". the focus will be on the ( 2 + 1)d case , and we indicate at the end how the results can be generalised .    in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    "general relativity is equivalent to a topological @xmath0 theory due to the absence of local degrees of freedom or gravitons . in the euclidean case",

    "the action is given by : @xmath203 = \\int_{{\\mathcal{m } } } \\mathrm{tr}[{\\mathbf{b}}\\wedge f({\\mathbf{a}})],\\ ] ] where @xmath204 is the curvature of @xmath201 . by restricting to space - time manifolds of the form @xmath205 , where @xmath5 is a compact 2-dimensional spatial manifold",
    ", we can pass to a hamiltonian formulation .",
    "the configuration space variable is given by the restriction @xmath206 of the connection @xmath201 to @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian is a sum of two constraints .",
    "the first imposes @xmath207-gauge invariance and the second , also referred to as the curvature constraint , implies that @xmath208 , i.e. that the connection is flat .",
    "a good overview and a comprehensive list of references can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the above is equivalent to a chern - simons gauge theory which was first used by witten in  @xcite to obtain a quantisation of 2 + 1 gravity . here",
    "we will be using the discrete ponzano - regge  @xcite or tuarev - viro  @xcite approaches to quantisation as they will resemble the dynamical triangulations models discussed above .",
    "the kinematical framework for the ponzano - regge model can be described by loop quantum gravity as first noticed by rovelli  @xcite .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space @xmath21 is constructed from a space of gauge - invariant wave - functions on the configuration space of connections .",
    "this space is spanned by the so - called spin - networks  @xcite , which are the natural generalisations of the wilson loop .",
    "spin - networks are functions of connections with support on graphs embedded in space , which in 2 + 1 we choose to be trivalent .",
    "more precisely , given any closed , oriented , trivalent graph @xmath209 with @xmath6 edges embedded in @xmath5 and a labelling of the edges by representations of su(2 ) denoted by @xmath210 , we can construct a spin - network function @xmath211 as follows .",
    "let us denote the holonomy of the connection @xmath206 along the edge @xmath212 by @xmath213 $ ] .",
    "this can be thought of as an su(2 ) group element .",
    "thus for every edge @xmath214 labelled by a spin @xmath215 we can construct a matrix @xmath216)^a_b$ ] , where @xmath217 is the spin-@xmath215 representation of su(2 ) .",
    "we can associate the index @xmath82 with the vertex to which the edge @xmath214 is directed and the index @xmath218 to the vertex at the other end of @xmath214 .",
    "taking the tensor product of these matrices gives us a tensor with three indices for every vertex in @xmath209 .",
    "we can contract these indices with the unique invariant tensor in the tensor product of the representations on the edges incident on the vertex .",
    "this gives us the gauge - invariant function @xmath211 .",
    "an inner product can now be imposed on the space generated by these functions by demanding that spin - networks be orthonormal , i.e. : @xmath219 completion with respect to this inner product gives us the kinematical hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "we can also describe the trivalent spin - networks in terms of their dual triangulations @xmath220 , making the link to earlier discussions .",
    "each edge of @xmath220 is labelled by the spin on the edge in @xmath209 intersecting it .",
    "we will switch between these two perspectives whenever convenient and spin - networks will be labelled either by graphs , triangulations or not at all .    to proceed we now need to implement the hamiltonian or curvature constraint @xmath221 and reduce to the final , physical , hilbert space @xmath24 . as before this is done by constructing the generalised projector .",
    "in contrast to the previous section one can give an exact expression of this projector in terms of sums over triangulations .",
    "as shown by ooguri  @xcite , the ponzano - regge model defines the projector for 2 + 1 quantum gravity .",
    "this is most easily introduced in terms of triangulations @xmath87 of @xmath222 $ ] .",
    "we will distinguish between the interior edges @xmath223 and the edges @xmath214 of the boundaries @xmath224 and @xmath225 of @xmath87 .",
    "all edges are labelled by representations @xmath215 of su(2 ) .",
    "hence we can associate to every tetrahedron a normalised 6-j symbol denoted by @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the set of spins on the boundary edges of @xmath193 , which can include edges that lie on the boundary of @xmath87 . to every triangulation @xmath87 with given boundary @xmath224 , @xmath225",
    "we can now define an amplitude @xmath228 as a sum over all possible labellings of the interior edges that are compatible with the labelling of the boundary : @xmath229 this sum can be infinite and needs to be regulated .",
    "this can be done by introducing a cut - off as is done by ooguri in  @xcite by using quantum groups .",
    "the latter approach gives the tuarev - viro model  @xcite which is related to quantum gravity with a cosmological constant .",
    "this will not concern us in the following and we assume that some choice of regularisation has been made to make the above expression well - defined .    given two spin - networks @xmath230 and @xmath231 , dual to triangulations @xmath224 and @xmath225 , we can now define the physical inner product as a sum over triangulations @xmath87 that have boundary @xmath232 : @xmath233 using identities between the 6-j symbols one can show that @xmath228 is in fact independent of the triangulation @xmath87 and depends only on @xmath224 and @xmath225 . hence the matrix elements of @xmath234 are given by @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is evaluated using any chosen triangulation with the correct boundary data .",
    "such an infinite factor is a common feature in the raq procedure whenever the constraints do not form the lie - algebra of a compact group  @xcite .",
    "the factor can be dropped by redefining the physical inner product and we have the final result : @xmath237    a crucial property for the identification of the amplitude @xmath236 with a projector is the property : @xmath238 where the sum is over all colourings @xmath239 of an intermediate triangulation @xmath220 .    as has been shown by ooguri  @xcite , this definition of @xmath234 leads to a well - defined theory of quantum gravity , which is equivalent to witten s chern - simons approach . if we formulate the above in terms of spin - networks instead of their dual triangulations we obtain the spin - foam model of 2 + 1 loop quantum gravity .",
    "a spin - foam is simply the 2-skeleton of the dual 2-complex of a given triangulation .",
    "the sum over spins on a triangulation can be given an interpretation as a sum over geometries or path integral in several ways .",
    "originally the ponzano - regge model was an ad hoc modification of the regge model of gravity .",
    "here one describes ( piecewise linear ) metrics by an assignment of edge lengths and angles to the tetrahedra in a triangulation of space - time . by restricting edge lengths to take on only integer and half - integer values",
    "we obtain the ponzano - regge model .",
    "the actions of the two models can be related in a semi - classical limit where we take spins @xmath240 to be large . in this limit",
    "the amplitude for a single tetrahedron given by the 6-j symbol can expressed as : @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the volume of the tetrahedron sides of length @xmath243 and @xmath244 is the regge action .",
    "hence it is natural to identify spins with geodesic lengths in the ponzano - regge model .",
    "the fact that the 6-j symbol describes a sum of two exponentials with opposite signs is related to the fact that the ponzano - regge model defines a true projector and hence not a sum over geometries as we comment on again below .",
    "a perhaps better understanding of the origin of the discreteness in the edge lengths comes via the spin foam approach .",
    "it is possible to show that ponzano - regge model arises if one discretises the path integral : @xmath245[d{\\mathbf{a } } ] e^{-is[{\\mathbf{b}},{\\mathbf{a}}]},\\ ] ] where the action is defined in equation  ( [ bf - action ] ) .",
    "the spins labelling edges then arise after an integration over @xmath202 , as the fourier components of the connection @xmath201 restricted to the edges of the triangulation .",
    "furthermore , one can construct a length operator for loop quantum gravity and one finds that the spins are precisely proportional to the quantised edge lengths as first noticed by rovelli in  @xcite .",
    "since spin - foam models involve a sum over edge lengths , a continuum limit can not be taken in the same way as in the dynamical triangulations models where edge lengths are taken to 0 .",
    "the implications of this will be discussed below .",
    "it turns out that we need to take the scale of the edge lengths to 0 .",
    "note however that because the special cases of @xmath0 theory and 2 + 1 quantum gravity are topological these models can be defined exactly in terms of a single triangulation without taking a continuum limit as described above .",
    "note also that the sum over geometries that is described by the ponzano - regge and more general spin - foam models is not gauge fixed .",
    "in other words different spin assignments of a triangulation can correspond to the same geometry .",
    "the rationale behind the spin foam approach is that instead of a picking a representative of each gauge equivalence class and integrating only over these we are in effect averaging over the equivalence classes .",
    "this will be important later .      in order to derive the sum over triangulations picture from the formal definition of the projector",
    "we now describe how one can construct @xmath228 for any @xmath87 and @xmath225 given an initial triangulation @xmath224 by an iterative sequence of elementary moves .",
    "these are the pachner moves in 2 + 1 dimensions by which all triangulations can be related .",
    "there are 3 ways of gluing a tetrahedron @xmath193 onto a given triangulation @xmath224 of @xmath5 .",
    "these are shown in figures  [ glue1 ] , [ glue2 ] and [ glue3 ] :    1 .",
    "we can attach one face of @xmath193 to a triangle in @xmath224 . to this tetrahedron",
    "we associate the factor @xmath246 where we have written out the 6-j symbol and @xmath247 are the spins on the edges of @xmath193 that are not glued to @xmath224 2 .",
    "we can attach two faces of @xmath193 to @xmath224 .",
    "this is associated with a factor @xmath248 where @xmath249 labels the edge that lies in the interior of the two triangles glued to @xmath224 and @xmath95 is the spin on the opposite edge .",
    "3 .   we can glue three faces of @xmath193 to @xmath224 . in this case",
    "we have a factor of @xmath250 where @xmath247 label the edges in the interior of the three triangles attached to @xmath224 .",
    ".,width=288 ]    .",
    "only the relevant spins are labelled.,width=288 ]    .,width=288 ]    .,width=288 ]    once we have completed the gluing we obtain a new boundary triangulation @xmath251 . using this boundary",
    "we can repeat the above procedure . in this way we can construct any triangulation @xmath87 with any boundary @xmath225",
    "given an original boundary @xmath224 . by taking the product of the factors associated to the tetrahedra",
    "we recover the amplitude @xmath228 .",
    "equivalently such a procedure can be viewed as constructing a sequence of spin - networks via a sequence of operator actions , which can be formalised as follows .",
    "we introduce the 3 move operators @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 , that act locally on spin - networks :    [ moves ]    rcl @xmath252 & = & @xmath255 +   + @xmath253 & = & @xmath256   +   + @xmath254 & = & @xmath257    by a finite sequence of such moves one can relate any two trivalent spin - networks .",
    "note that @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 are precisely dual to the three possible gluings of tetrahedra as shown in figure  [ duality ] .",
    "the amplitudes also correspond to those given in equations  ( [ g1 ] ) , ( [ g2 ] ) and  ( [ g3 ] ) .    hence any coloured triangulation @xmath87 can be viewed as a given sequence of such elementary moves .",
    "acting on the dual graphs.,title=\"fig:\",height=96 ] +   acting on the dual graphs.,title=\"fig:\",height=96 ]    as with the dynamical triangulations models , we wish to use the fact that the projector can be expressed as an ordered sequence of operations in order to derive the above action from the formal expression of the projector .",
    "this will clarify how the elementary move operators @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 are related to evolution operators and in consequence the hamiltonian .",
    "we wish to provide a regularisation of the generalised projector as a product of elementary local operators in analogy to the approach in section  [ expansion1 ] .",
    "these elementary operators are to be identified with the moves @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 . but note that in contrast to the dynamical triangulations case the these moves do not involve a fixed proper time , instead the describe a sum over all possible proper times .",
    "this needs to be reflected in our expansion .",
    "it turns out that the correct starting point for our calculation is the following expression for the projector : @xmath258 e^{-i\\int_0 ^ 1 dt \\int d^2x n(x , t ) { \\hat{h}}(x)},\\ ] ] where we are integrating over all lapse functions on the cylinder @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the reason we need to extend the range of integration as compared to our previous definition in equation  ( [ projector ] ) is that the path integral that we wish to recover is not gauge fixed as mentioned already above .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the two definitions of the projector are related by : @xmath259 e^{-i\\int_0 ^ 1 dt \\int d^2x n(x , t ) { \\hat{h}}(x ) } = { \\mathcal{n}}\\int[dt(x ) ] e^{-i{\\hat{h}}[t]},\\ ] ] where @xmath260 and @xmath261 is an infinite normalisation factor , which should correspond to the volume of the gauge equivalence classes .",
    "finally , we note that in this section we integrate over the entire range of lapse functions since we want to describe a genuine projector .",
    "let us now proceed with the regularisation of @xmath13 by replacing integrals by riemann sums .",
    "first we consider the integral over the coordinate time @xmath196 and we replace the integration over functions @xmath262 by a product of integrations over spatial functions @xmath263 .",
    "this leads to the following regularised expression : @xmath264 e^{-i\\sum_{t=0}^k { \\epsilon}\\int d^2x n(x , t{\\epsilon } ) { \\hat{h}}(x)}\\\\ & = & \\prod_{t=0}^k \\int [ dn(x ) ] e^{-i{\\epsilon}\\int d^2x n(x ) { \\hat{h}}(x)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath265 .",
    "now we proceed analogously with the remaining spatial integral in the exponential . to do this we need to introduce a square lattice with a set of vertices @xmath96 as before .",

    "let us now set @xmath268 then we have the final expression : @xmath269    this expression is similar to equation  ( [ expansion ] ) and can be interpreted as a sum over triangulations .",
    "there are however essential differences , most notably in the definition of @xmath123 .",
    "let us take these in turn .",
    "the operator @xmath107 we have defined above is given by a sum over local evolution operators for all proper times .",
    "hence it is natural to make the identification : @xmath270 the argument @xmath77 of the operator @xmath107 determines the location of the action of the move operators @xmath271 on a given spin network .",
    "the integral over @xmath193 in the definition of @xmath123 essentially reflects the sum over spins in the definition of the elementary moves .",
    "this identification is further supported by the fact that @xmath123 contains two terms involving an evolution in opposite proper time directions .",
    "this mirrors the semi - classical interpretation of the 6-j symbol given a sum of two exponentials of the regge action described in equation  ( [ semi - class ] ) .",
    "here we can see that this is a result of the integration range in the integral over lapse functions in the definition of the projector and hence a consequence of the fact that we are not dealing with a sum over geometries but a genuine projection operator .",
    "once we have made the identification of @xmath123 with the elementary moves we can see how equation  ( [ new - expansion ] ) describes a sum over triangulations .",
    "each operator @xmath107 adds a tetrahedron in all possible ways and with all possible spins to a boundary triangulation at location @xmath77 .",
    "as we take the limit @xmath118 the product over positions @xmath272 then describes the addition of tetrahedra to every position on the initial boundary , such that we obtain a single layer of tetrahedra .",
    "we then repeat this at the next co - ordinate time step .",
    "the result is that we obtain a sum over triangulations which each have a layered structure as depicted in figure  [ slices ] .",
    "these layers can be interpreted as the slices @xmath273 in the foliation @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the spins on the edges of the tetrahedra describe the multi - fingered proper - time separation between the slices .",
    "the sum over spins then includes all possible proper - time separations between initial and final boundaries .",
    "we have so far not addressed how the parameter @xmath92 is related to the moves @xmath271 and how this continuum limit @xmath274 is to be interpreted . indeed , as mentioned above we",
    "can no longer identify @xmath92 simply with a proper time separation since we are summing over all possible proper times for every tetrahedron .",
    "instead we see from equation  ( [ new - evolution ] ) that @xmath92 multiplies the proper time @xmath193 and hence is responsible for determining the scale of the sum over proper times .",
    "this indicates that @xmath92 should be identified with the scale associated in the relation between spins and edge lengths of tetrahedra .",
    "indeed , in a continuum limit we would like the edge lengths to become small in some units .",
    "hence , we should set physical lengths proportional to spins via : @xmath275 .",
    "remarkably this parameter arises naturally in 3 + 1 loop quantum gravity .",
    "it is the immirzi parameter  @xcite @xmath276 , which describes a one - parameter family of classical canonical transformations which in turn give rise to a one - parameter family of _ inequivalent _ quantum theories .",
    "this parameter relates spin labels of spin networks to the spectra of physical geometrical operators .",
    "it determines that the eigenvalues are given in units of @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the planck length and the power @xmath82 is the dimension of the geometric observable we are considering .",
    "hence , we deduce that we should make the identification @xmath279 and a continuum limit of loop quantum gravity is obtained by taking the immirzi parameter to 0 .",
    "this is especially interesting as it has been proposed in an entirely different context by bojowald  @xcite , who studied reduced cosmological models using loop quantum gravity .",
    "we note again that @xmath0 theory and ( 2 + 1)d gravity are special in that they are topological and the limit @xmath274 does not in fact need to be taken to define the theory .",
    "this can be interpreted as stating that it does not matter at which scale we approximate a continuum geometry .",
    "since there are only a finite number of degrees of freedom any discrete approximation will capture the full physical content of the theory .      in the previous section we have provided a well motivated expansion of the projector describing the ponzano - regge sum over triangulations .",
    "some of the attractive features of this approach were :    * the natural identification of the sum over spins as a sum over proper - times ; * the explanation of the semi - classical limit of 6-j symbols in equation  ( [ semi - class ] ) as a result of the integration range in the generalised projector ; * the identification of the continuum limit as a limit in which the scales of edge lengths are taken to 0 ; * the reflection of the fact that the ponzano - regge model does not describe a gauge fixed sum over metrics in the definition of the projector given in equation  ( [ new - projector ] ) .    in this section",
    "we discuss a further motivation for our approach , which is closely linked to questions concerning the hamiltonian .",
    "the point is that the local move operators @xmath271 leave physical states invariant , i.e. : @xmath280 for all @xmath281 , @xmath282 this is shown by ooguri in  @xcite .",
    "let us take @xmath253 as an example .",
    "we have : @xmath283 here @xmath284 is the spin - network dual to the coloured triangulation @xmath224 and @xmath285 is the triangulation which is obtained from @xmath224 by adding a tetrahedron with external spin @xmath249 as shown in figure  [ glue2 ] .",
    "the last equality in the above equation follows from the definition of @xmath236 and the fact that , due to the triangulation invariance of the model , the transition amplitude between the states @xmath284 and @xmath286 is given by the amplitude of a single tetrahedron , which in turn is the same as the amplitude of the @xmath253 move .",
    "hence , it follows : @xmath287 where we have used the projection property  ( [ projectionprop ] ) of the amplitude @xmath236 .",
    "this can also be understood as follows .",
    "the constraints of 2 + 1 general relativity impose the condition that the connection is flat .",
    "physical states can be though of spin - network functions evaluated on flat connections .",
    "but it can be shown that the action of the elementary moves on spin - network functions restricted to flat connections is the identity",
    ".    physical states are orbits of kinematical states under the exponentiated action of the hamiltonian constraint . hence the elementary moves map between states in @xmath21 that are related by such action and they can thus be viewed as elementary time - evolutions .",
    "thus it is natural to identify the moves with the evolution operator @xmath123 .",
    "note , however , that this is in contrast to earlier assumptions on the action of the hamiltonian in loop quantum gravity .",
    "let us recall that in the reisenberger - rovelli approach the exponential in the projector is expanded as follows : @xmath288 e^{-i{\\hat{h}}[t ] } = \\int [ dt(x ) ] \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty } \\frac{(-i)^t}{t ! } { \\hat{h}}[t]^t,\\ ] ] the idea was to identify @xmath37 $ ] with the total move operator @xmath289 = { \\hat{s}}:= \\int_\\sigma dx ( a_1{\\hat{m}}_1 + a_2{\\hat{m}}_2 + a_3{\\hat{m}}_3),\\ ] ] where @xmath290 and @xmath291 are arbitrary coefficients that need to be fixed .",
    "this was motivated because the action of thiemann s hamiltonian  @xcite in 3 + 1 dimensions resembled the move @xmath252 albeit with a different amplitude .",
    "the other moves need to be included in the hamiltonian if the multiple actions of the hamiltonian are to give rise to all triangulations .",
    "this is because the integral over the scalar lapse functions does not alter the topological action of the operators .",
    "the search for such a hamiltonian , also referred to as crossing symmetric , has met only with partial success  @xcite . in particular",
    "it is not clear how the move @xmath253 , which is thought to be crucial for long range propagation of excitations  @xcite , can be derived from the quantisation of a classical expression of a hamiltonian .",
    "but from the discussion above one can understand why this might be the wrong approach .",
    "since the local moves leave physical states invariant it is impossible that any combination of them will annihilate physical states as would be required if they were to correspond to a hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this is because the integrated move operator will be a sum of elementary operators acting at all possible locations in the triangulation underlying a spin - network .",
    "each single action leaves physical states invariant .",
    "this implies the following for the action of the hamiltonian defined in equation  ( [ tot - moves ] ) on spin networks @xmath292 and @xmath293 @xmath294{\\tilde{\\psi}}[\\phi ] & : = & \\int_\\sigma dx { \\langle \\phi |}{\\hat{p}}(a_1{\\hat{m}}_1 + a_2{\\hat{m}}_2 + a_3 { \\hat{m}}_3){| \\psi \\rangle}\\\\ & = & ( a_1 n_1(\\psi ) + a_2 n_2(\\psi ) + a_3 n_3(\\psi))\\delta_{\\psi,\\phi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used equation  ( [ invar ] ) and the orthogonality of spin - network states in the kinematical inner product .",
    "the coefficients @xmath295 , @xmath296 , @xmath297 count the number of times that the operators @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 respectively can act on the state @xmath292 .",
    "but since these coefficients are state dependent and the coefficients @xmath298 are not , the action of @xmath299 $ ] can not be made to vanish on all physical states .",
    "so from our perspective it seems clear that the difficulties in generalising the definition of the loop quantum gravity hamiltonian stems from identifying the move operators with hamiltonian actions and not evolutions .",
    "this is in line with views expressed by markopoulou  @xcite , where evolution of spin networks is described in terms of the pachner moves listed above . in",
    "so far as these models should reproduce quantum gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions our work gives them a precise motivation in terms of canonical loop quantum gravity and shows that the amplitudes for these transitions should be given by the 6-j symbols as described above .",
    "the problem we face is to find a hamiltonian which can reproduce the elementary moves when exponentiated .",
    "this seems a difficult task .",
    "one possibility is that it would be possible to quantise the action generated by the classical hamiltonian directly , in the same way that it is only possible to solve the diffeomorphism constraint by quantising the action generated by it .",
    "another option that is currently being explored is to make use of the close connection to the classical formulation of 2 + 1 gravity in terms of t hoofts lattice model  @xcite . here",
    "states are described by trivalent graphs with labellings corresponding to edge lengths .",
    "it can be shown that hamiltonian evolution increases and decreases the edge lengths .",
    "crucially , edge lengths can evolve to zero at which point a change in the topology of the graph can occur .",
    "these possible changes have been tabulated in  @xcite and , in the absence of matter , they turn out to be precisely the three elementary evolution moves . hence it is possible that hamiltonian action should act on edges by increasing and decreasing the values of the spins by adding loops of spin 1 to all closed loops in the graph of a given spin - network .",
    "our results hold for @xmath0 theories in any dimension , which are all topological field theories .",
    "these models are also expressed in terms of a single triangulation , where the 6-j symbols are replaced by their higher dimensional analogues .",
    "the situation looks more complicated for quantum gravity since in space - time dimension higher than 3 the theory has an infinite number of degrees of freedom , and is no longer equivalent to @xmath0 theory and no longer topological .",
    "however there still exist spin - foam models that attempt to define a path integral for the theory both for lorentzian and euclidean signatures ( see  @xcite for a review ) . in this case",
    "the transition amplitudes are no longer triangulation independent and we need to include the sum over triangulations to restore covariance .",
    "however , our results have shown that the sum over triangulations should be restricted to triangulations with a slicing structure .",
    "such restricted sums have been studied in the context of lorentzian dynamical triangulation models  @xcite and there is mounting evidence that they have better behaviour than sums over generic triangulations .",
    "in addition , as soon as spin - foam models are no longer topological , taking a continuum limit will become important .",
    "our work indicates that in loop quantum gravity and related spin - foam models this limit involves considering large spins while taking the immirzi parameter @xmath276 to 0 .",
    "this has been suggested independently by bojowald in the context of cosmological models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the study of the geometric operators area , volume and angle around a vertex of a spin - network carried out by major and seifert  @xcite has revealed that in order to approximate continuum geometries resembling what we observe , we need to consider a large spin limit .    we note also that for non - topological theories we can no longer argue that the elementary moves leave physical states invariant .",
    "presumably again this is linked to the need to take the continuum limit in defining the evolution operators .",
    "the physical consequences of this deserves to be investigated in more detail .",
    "we are grateful to jan ambjrn for continuing support throughout this work , especially for the idea on how to derive the hamiltonian constraint in ( 1 + 1 ) dynamical triangulations .",
    "we would also like to thank marcus gaul , b.  durhuus and carlo rovelli for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the eu - network on `` discrete random geometries '' grant hprn - ct-1999 - 00161 .",
    "we show that if a triangulation is generated by the action of an ordered product @xmath140 acting on an auxiliary state , then this is the unique sequence of operators that will produce this triangulation , where @xmath129 is defined in equation  ( [ u - def ] ) .",
    "we proceed by induction over the number of triangles in a triangulation .",
    "clearly the addition of one triangle to a boundary triangulation corresponds to a unique action of on @xmath129 .",
    "the position @xmath77 is given by the co - ordinate of the node on the right edge of the triangle glued to the boundary .",
    "let us assume that any triangulation with @xmath6 triangles has a unique sequence of evolution operators corresponding to it .",
    "now let us consider a triangulation with @xmath300 triangles , which can be described by at least one sequence of operators .",
    "this triangulation will have a set of triangles that is attached to the boundary .",
    "this set inherits an ordering from the order of the coordinates of the nodes on the edges that the triangles are glued to .",
    "hence , the triangulation will contain a unique triangle , which is defined by the fact that it is attached to a boundary edge with the largest value of the node coordinate .",
    "since the products of evolution operators in the expansion of @xmath144 are ordered this triangle has to be constructed first .",
    "hence the first operator in any sequence of operators corresponding to our triangulation is fixed and unique ."
