    "celeste ( cherenkov low energy sampling and timing experiment ) was a cherenkov experiment using the heliostats of the former lectricit de france solar plant in the french pyrenees at the thmis site .",
    "it detected cherenkov light from electromagnetic showers produced in the atmosphere by the @xmath0-rays coming from high energy astrophysical sources .",
    "the light is reflected to secondary optics and photomultipliers installed at the top of the tower .",
    "finally it is sampled to be analysed  @xcite .",
    "two states of the experiment have to be distinguished to classify celeste data . during the first one ( between september 1999 and june 2001 ) , 40  heliostats were used with two types of pointing ( single pointing : all heliostats at 11  km , double pointing : half at 11  km , half at 25  km ) , and during the second one ( between september 2001 and june 2004 ) ,",
    "53  heliostats pointing at 11  km were used ( of which 12 veto heliostats aiming wide for proton rejection ) .",
    "an analysis improvement has been made on the last data with 53  heliostats taking the crab ( nebula ) data as reference , since the source is bright and stable .",
    "the new analysis variable provided a sensitivity of 5.1  @xmath1 on 5.3  h data , whereas the old data analysis gave 2.0 and 3.4  @xmath1 for single and double pointing  @xcite .",
    "the new analysis has been tested on old crab data with 40  heliostats and gives better sensitivity as will be shown .",
    "celeste has taken 40  heliostats data on the blazar mrk  501 .",
    "the old analysis gave 2.5  @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we present here the results obtained with the new analysis .",
    "mrk  501 is a source interest : it is one of the brightest and closest ( @xmath3 ) extragalactic x - ray and tev sources .",
    "a detection with celeste could help to understand the emission processes .",
    "first , the new analysis will be explained with the results obtained on the crab data .",
    "then , the data selection and analysis , and finally the lightcurve of mrk  501 will be presented .",
    "a new method was found to exploit the fadc information to reject the hadronic background  @xcite . to detect low energy @xmath0-rays",
    ", we use the sum of the individual digitized signals to increase the signal - to - background ratio ( figure  [ fig : fadc ] ) .",
    "the summation includes a correction for the sphericity of the wavefront , assumed to be centered in the 11  km plane . assuming a wrong position for this center ( impact parameter ) broadens the sum : the height - over - width ratio @xmath4 decreases .",
    "we compute @xmath4 repeatedly for a grid of different assumed positions .",
    "the impact parameter is taken to be the position for which the @xmath4 ratio is maximum , denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "this is valid for @xmath0-rays ( figure  [ fig : timing ]  ( a ) ) but not for protons arriving isotropically and for which the wavefront is not spherical ( figure  [ fig : timing ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "a measurement of the flatness of these 2d - distributions is given by the following estimator : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the average of @xmath4 over 24 positions along a ring 200  m from the maximum position .",
    "for @xmath0-rays there is a clear maximum and this estimator takes low values . for hadrons",
    ", it is usually larger ( figure  [ fig : timing ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "-ray and ( b ) for a 500 gev proton .",
    "( c ) distribution of the @xmath8 parameter for off data ( filled black circles ) and @xmath0-rays simulation ( red line ) . ]    to improve the signal quality the cut was optimized on the crab data .",
    "for the data with 53  heliostats , the applied cut is @xmath9 ( figure  [ fig : totqflxsi ] ) which is the biggest contribution to an improvement in crab sensitivity to 5.1  @xmath1 .",
    "the detection is stable .",
    "40  heliostat crab data were also analysed with this variable .",
    "since this estimator is very sensitive , the chosen cut is different : optimizing the cut on 40  heliostats with single pointing gives @xmath10 ( @xmath9 for double pointing ) which is not yet understood .",
    "simulations are in preparation to confirm ( or not ) this cut .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tab : crab ] .",
    "on the 53  heliostat crab data integrating @xmath8 by the left : @xmath11 .",
    "the maximum of the signal is obtained for @xmath9 . ]",
    "celeste took data on mrk  501 during 2000 and 2001 with 40  heliostats . the previous analysis giving 2.5  @xmath2",
    ", we hope to improve this result with the new analysis .",
    "data selection is stricter than in  @xcite .",
    "we keep data with stable currents , small on@xmath12off current and trigger rate differences and number of events @xmath13 . finally , after analysis cuts , the off data rate should only depend on the hour angle .",
    "low rates at small hour angle are an indication for bad atmospheric conditions .",
    "thus , we require that they be @xmath14 ( figure  [ fig : txcut ] ) .",
    "there was no cut applied on hour angle .",
    "after selection , 37  pairs ( 10.9  h ) remain : 10  pairs were taken with single pointing at 11  km and 27 with double pointing at 11/25  km .",
    "all pairs are kept together to have more statistics . in terms of years",
    ", we have 31  pairs during 2000 and 6  pairs during 2001 .",
    "the results of the new analysis are presented in table  [ tab : mrk501 ] . since 40  heliostat crab data with single and double pointing",
    "do nt give the same cut to apply on @xmath8 , the difficulty here is to choose the cut ( figure  [ fig : xsimrk501 ] ) .",
    "if we apply @xmath10 , we get 2.9  @xmath2 on all the data ( 3.1  @xmath2 in 2000 , 0.0  @xmath2 in 2001 ) .",
    "if we apply @xmath9 , we get again 2.5  @xmath2 on all the data like with the old analysis ( 2.4  @xmath2 in 2000 , 0.7  @xmath2 in 2001 ) .",
    "the chosen cut to present the lightcurve hereafter is @xmath10 , because we have the assumption that the distribution of the @xmath8 variable depends on the declination ( owing to its construction ) . figure  [ fig : xsicrab ] shows this distribution for the 53  heliostat crab data . in comparison , we can see in figure  [ fig : xsimrk421 ] the same distribution for 53  heliostat mrk  421 data , which has the same declination as mrk  501 .",
    "the distribution is shifted towards the left .    off @xmath8 distribution for the 40  heliostat mrk  501 data ( single and double pointing ) .",
    "]    off @xmath8 distribution for the 53  heliostat crab data ( filled black circles ) compared to simulations on crab normalized to the data ( red line ) . ]",
    "off @xmath8 distribution for the 53  heliostat mrk  421 data  @xcite . ]",
    "a work is in preparation that compares thoses distributions for crab , mrk  421 and mrk  501 40  heliostat data with simulations .",
    "since we have a lot of data on mrk  421 , we will be able to optimize our cut on this source and apply it to mrk  501 .",
    "celeste raw trigger rates are typically 25  hz during the winter .",
    "in early fall and in spring , rates fall by a factor of two .",
    "the lidar on site showed that increased atmospheric extinction due to aerosols is a major cause  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it started to get data in december 2001 after these data on mrk  501 .",
    "we looked at the possible influence of this effect on the on@xmath12off excess , but nothing was highlighted : for trigger rate @xmath15  hz , 20  pairs give 2.7  @xmath2 during 6.0  h , and for trigger rate @xmath16  hz , 17  pairs give 1.5  @xmath2 during 4.9  h.",
    "we present in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] the lightcurve obtained by celeste for monthly averages with the chosen cut @xmath10 . note that mrk  501 was active in x - rays during 2000 and quiet during 2001  @xcite . during the year 2000 ,",
    "the cut to be confirmed , we get an on@xmath12off excess of 3.1  @xmath2 during 9.1  h.",
    "before the lidar study , the acceptance was unknown for data with trigger rates less than 15 hz .",
    "we now have more confidence in the 3.1  @xmath2 obtained for the year 2000 and in our acceptance . therefore ,",
    "if this result is confirmed , we will interpret this excess as a weak signal and calculate a flux .",
    "the acceptance will include the degraded atmospheric extinction .    if we interpret this excess as a signal , and under the ( false ) assumption that we have the same detector acceptance and spectrum for mrk  501 as for the crab , we get one fourth of the crab flux .",
    "this is comparable with the results presented in  @xcite ( data on april 29 , 1998 in x - rays similar to spring 2000 ) .",
