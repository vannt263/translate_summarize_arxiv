    "magnetars , comprising soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , have been brought to great attention because they are likely to have super strong surface magnetic fields reaching @xmath8 g @xcite .",
    "this exceeds the critical field strength @xmath9 g , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the electron mass , the light velocity , the electron charge and the reduced planck constant , respectively . to understand radiation processes in such an environment , it is necessary to fully take into account non - perturbative effects in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "outstanding properties of magnetars include burst activity , observed from all sgrs and some axps .",
    "a typical `` short burst '' has a duration of @xmath1100 ms , and a 2100 kev energy release by 10@xmath14 erg ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among a variety of burst activities ,",
    "the most energetic ones are the giant flares , which were so far detected from sgr0526@xmath1566 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , sgr1900@xmath014 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and sgr1806@xmath1520 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray spectra of short bursts provide useful diagnostics of their emission mechanism .",
    "wide - band spectra of short bursts from sgr1806@xmath1520 and sgr1900@xmath014 , detected by high energy transient explorer 2 ( hete-2 ; @xcite ) , are generally described by a photoelectrically absorbed two - blackbody ( 2bb ) model @xcite , even though this could be a phenomenological description .",
    "spectra of bursts @xcite and intermidiate flares @xcite from sgr 1900@xmath014 also favor the 2bb modeling .",
    "in addition , bursts from the new magnetar sgr0501@xmath04516 , detected by suzaku @xcite and swift @xcite , also exhibited 2bb - type spectra ( @xcite , hereafter paperi ; @xcite ) . in terms of this modeling",
    ", these short bursts all exhibit an interesting scaling as @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the higher and lower temperatures of the 2bb model , respectively .",
    "it has long been known that sgrs and axps show not only burst activities but also persistent emission in energies below @xmath110 kev , of which the spectra are generally reproduced by two phenomenological models ; 2bb ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a photoelectrically absorbed blackbody plus power law model ( bb@xmath0pl ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , recent studies of sgr0501@xmath04516 and other objects propose a `` blackbody plus comptonized blackbody '' model ( @xcite , hereafter paperii ) and a resonant cyclotron scattering model @xcite as alternative possibilities .",
    "although the spectral modeling is thus ambiguous , the persistent x - ray emission interestingly shows the same @xmath16 relation as those of the bursts @xcite if we employ the 2bb representation .",
    "this suggests a common radiation mechanism between the bursts and persistent emission , further leading to a possibility that the persistent x - ray emission may consist of numerous micro bursts @xcite .",
    "recent studies using integral ( e.g. , @xcite ) and suzaku ( @xcite ; paperii ; @xcite ) revealed an extremely hard x - ray component above @xmath110 kev in persistent emission spectra of a significant fraction of sgrs ( including sgr0501@xmath04516 : paperii ) and axps . the hard x - ray component , which is thought to be distinct from the blackbody - like soft component , can be reproduced by a power law ( pl ) model with an extremely hard photon index of @xmath19 .",
    "as reported in paperii for sgr0501@xmath04516 and in @xcite for some other sources , the 2100 kev luminosity of the hard x - ray component is often comparable to that of the soft blackbody component . considering these properties , as well as a clear dependence of the hardness ratio between the hard and soft luminosities on the characteristic age",
    "as revealed with suzaku @xcite , the hard x - ray component is expected to provide an important clue to the nature of magnetars . theoretically , the hard x - ray production mechanism is extensively discussed @xcite , but it is not yet conclusive .    if there is a common radiation mechanism between the bursts and persistent emissions , the hard x - ray component may also be seen in burst spectra . however , short bursts of magnetars so far studied , with fluence @xmath20 erg @xmath3 , generally have @xmath21715 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", their 2bb spectra , extending well up to @xmath22 kev , would mask any hard x - ray component .",
    "this raises a possibility that bursts with considerably lower fluence , which have remained not much studied , may have lower values of @xmath17 , e.g. , close to those found in the persistent emission ( e.g. , @xmath210.43.9 kev ; @xcite ; paperii ) , and would allow more sensitive searches for the hard - tail component . considering this",
    ", we focus on wide - band spectroscopy of low - fluence bursts .",
    "observations with suzaku are suitable for this purpose , because of its high sensitive over a broad energy band , realized by the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; 0.212 kev ; @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; 10600 kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have hence revisited the suzaku data of sgr0501@xmath04516 , acquired during its 2008 august activity . as a third publication ( after paperi and paperii ) from this observation , the present paper reports on our successful detection of a hard component , in an hxd spectrum which sums over 31 short bursts from this new magnetar .",
    "the new soft gamma repeater sgr0501@xmath04516 was discovered on 2008 august 22 by the burst alert telescope on - board swift , when it displayed sgr - like burst activity @xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery , a spin period of @xmath23 was reported based on an observation by the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite .",
    "as described in paperi and paperii , we triggered a suzaku target - of - opportunity ( too ) observation , which started at 00:05 on 2008 august 26 and ended at 08:25 on 2008 august 27 ( ut ) .",
    "the xis was operated with a 1/4 window option which yields a 2 s time resolution , while the hxd was operated in the standard mode .",
    "the acquired data were already utilized in paperi and paperii ; the former described a strong short burst and persistent soft x - ray emission , while the latter focused on the detection of a hard component in the persistent emission .",
    "the present paper , utilizing the same too data , deals with broad - band spectra of 31 smaller short bursts .",
    "the distance to sgr0501@xmath04516 , though estimated to be 1.5 kpc based on its directional proximity to the young supernova remnant hb9 @xcite , is actually very uncertain . in this paper ,",
    "the distance is hence assumed to be 4 kpc , which is similar to the value of @xmath15 kpc employed by @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the xis and hxd event data ( v2.2 ) were made using heasoft6.6.1 software .",
    "the latest calibration database ( caldb:20090402 ) was applied to unfiltered xis event data using _ xispi _ ( v2008 - 04 - 10 ) .",
    "then , using _ xselect _ ( v2.4a ) , we extracted a new set of filtered xis events with the standard criteria and a grade selection `` grade = ( 0,2 - 4,6 ) '' .",
    "after that , hot and flickering pixels were removed using _ cleansis _ ( v1.7 ) .",
    "telemetry - saturated time intervals , estimated by _ xisgtigen _ ( v2007 - 05 - 14 ) , were removed from the xis data using _",
    "xselect_. we created light curves and spectra from the cleaned xis event data using _",
    "xselect_. response matrix files were generated by _",
    "( v2007 - 05 - 14 ) , and ancillary response function files by _ xissimarfgen _ ( v2008 - 04 - 05 ) .",
    "the obtained net exposure is @xmath160 ks .    using _ hxdpi _ and _ hxdgrade _ ( v2008 - 03 - 03 )",
    ", we applied the latest calibration database ( caldb:20090902 ) to the unfiltered hxd event data . cleaned pin and gso events",
    "were extracted from these newly calibrated data with the standard criteria using _",
    "xselect_. again , we created light curves and spectra using _",
    "xselect_. dead time corrections were applied to the spectra using _",
    "hxddtcor_. response matrix files of version 2008 - 01 - 29 were used .",
    "this yielded a net exposure of @xmath24 ks for the hxd data .",
    "as shown in figure1 of paperi , a number of visually obvious bursts are found in a 0.212 kev xis light curve with 2-s resolution , obtained by summing the data from the two fi sensors ( xis0 and xis3 ) and the one bi sensor ( xis1 ) .",
    "at least three of them , including the strongest one analyzed in paperi , were also noticed in the 1020 kev hxd - pin light curve with a 500 ms time resolution .",
    "following our preliminary attempt in paperi , we conducted a quantitative burst search using the 0.212 kev light curve of the xis .",
    "after visually eliminating 8 obvious bursts which have @xmath25 cts(2s)@xmath26 , the light curve was converted to a count - rate ( per 2s ) histogram as shown in figure [ fig : xis_hist ] ; this includes the background , the persistent signal emission , and short bursts .",
    "the histogram has an average of @xmath27 and a standard deviation of @xmath28 , both in units of cts(2s)@xmath26 , where the quoted errors refer to 90% confidence levels , and can be approximated by a poissonian distribution .",
    "we searched the xis count - rate histogram for those 2-s bins where the count rate exceeds @xmath29 cts(2s)@xmath26 .",
    "this selection has yielded 35 time bins with significant excess counts . regarding a set of consecutive such bins as representing a single burst",
    ", we thus detected 32 short bursts altogether . among them ,",
    "the strongest one was already analyzed in paperi .",
    "below , we therefore analyze the remaining 31 bursts , which are summarized in table [ tab : burst_summary ] .",
    "they are hereafter identified sequentially as # 01 , # 02 , @xmath30 , and # 31 .",
    "these 31 short bursts are considered to be free from event pile - up effects in the xis , because their count rates were less than 107 cts(2s)@xmath26xis@xmath26 above which the effect becomes significant .",
    "light curves of typical short bursts ( # 03 , # 13 , # 14 , # 22 and # 23 ) are presented in figure [ fig : burst_lc ] . among them , two ( # 03 and # 14 ) are accompanied by significant emissions in the hxd - pin and/or hxd - gso energy bands .",
    "since the present paper puts its focus on burst spectra , we must subtract the persistent emission of sgr0501@xmath04516 , as well as the non x - ray background and the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "for each burst , we therefore accumulate the xis and hxd data over a time region ( see below ) containing the burst , and subtract the corresponding background spectra which are acquired before and after the burst period .",
    "the on - burst and background data of the xis were both extracted from box regions with sizes of ( detx , dety ) = ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) for xis1 , and ( @xmath32 , @xmath31 ) for xis0 and xis3 , where detx and dety are detector coordinates .",
    "each on - burst spectrum was made using a 2-s or 6-s time interval , depending on the burst duration in the xis .",
    "the corresponding background spectra were extracted from two 10-s time intervals , one before and the other after the burst , both separated by 2 s from the on - burst time region . the result does not change if we instead employ 15 s for the background time intervals .",
    "therefore , the pulsed persistent emission with a period of @xmath33 s ( paperi ) does not affect the background spectrum .",
    "if the background time intervals contained other bursts , they were eliminated from the background spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows 6-band synthetic light curves summed over the 31 short bursts , obtained by stacking their individual light curves in reference to the 0.212 kev xis data .",
    "thus , the burst emission is clearly seen in the hxd - pin data up to 40 kev , and possibly in the 50100 kev hxd - gso band .",
    "average on - burst and background count - rates of the xis are @xmath153 cts(2s)@xmath26 and @xmath114 cts(2s)@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "since the xis have a time resolution of 2 s , the burst profiles in the hxd energy bands in figure [ fig : lc ] must be considerably smeared out .",
    "figure [ fig : fgbg_comp ] shows on - burst ( _ green _ ) , background ( _ red _ ) , and background subtracted ( _ black _ ) spectra of the xis and the hxd , summed over the 31 bursts . in agreement with figure [ fig : lc ] ,",
    "the burst emission is significantly detected with hxd - pin up to @xmath140 kev .",
    "also , the burst signal may be detected marginally in the 50100 kev gso data .    before quantifying the burst spectrum ,",
    "let us compare it with that of the persistent emission of sgr0501@xmath04516 . to do this in a model - independent manner",
    ", we directly divided the summed burst spectrum to the background - subtracted persistent - component spectrum derived in paperii .",
    "the ratio in the xis range was estimated using the two fi sensors .",
    "the results , presented in figure [ fig : spc_ratio ] , indicate that the burst spectrum is clearly harder than the persistent emission spectrum .",
    "in addition , the ratio in the hxd range is approximately flat , implying that in this energy range the burst and persistent emission have approximately the same spectral shape .    using xspec 12.5.0 @xcite , we fitted the summed burst spectrum with a photoelectrically absorbed 2bb model , which has been most successful on the short bursts from sgr1806@xmath1520 and sgr1900@xmath014 ( section [ intro ] ) .",
    "the photoelectric absorption was fixed to @xmath34 @xmath3 , as estimated from the persistent x - ray emission observed by the xis ( paperi ) . according to a cross - calibration between the xis and the hxd described in @xcite , the hxd normalization is typically 13% higher than that of the xis for crab data acquired at the xis nominal position .",
    "therefore the relative normalization of the hxd above the xis was fixed to 1.13 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spc ] ( b ) , this 2bb fits leaves significant positive residuals in energies above @xmath120 kev , which makes the fit unacceptable with @xmath35 .",
    "although the 2bb fit could be improved to @xmath36 by allowing to vary the hxd vs. xis relative normalizaiton , the obtained normalization ratio , @xmath37 , is far outside the value of @xmath38 obtained from crab observations @xcite , making the fit unrealistic .",
    "conversely , the 2bb fit did not improve significantly if the hxd normalization is kept within this uncertainty range .",
    "given figure [ fig : spc_ratio ] , as well as the failure of the 2bb model , we fitted the burst spectrum with a 2bb plus power law model ( 2bb@xmath0pl ) .",
    "the fit was then improved to @xmath39 .",
    "the pl component is considered to be significant , because an f - test indicates a probability of @xmath10.1% for the fit improvement ( by adding pl ) to arise by chance .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters are summarized in table [ tab : spc_summary ] , and the @xmath40 form of the 2bb@xmath0pl fit is given in figure [ fig : spc ] ( d ) .",
    "as already expected from figure [ fig : spc_ratio ] , the power - law component indeed exhibits a photon index of @xmath19 , which is comparable to that of the hard x - ray component of the persistent emission ( e.g. , paperii ) .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the summed short burst spectrum has a hard - tail component , which has never been detected in the burst spectra of any other magnetar .    using the best - fit 2bb@xmath0pl spectral parameters , a bolometric fluence of the 2bb component and a 240 kev fluence of the pl component",
    "are calculated as shown in table [ tab : spc_summary ] .",
    "those fluences refer to average values of the 31 short bursts , and are lower by two orders of magnitude than a typical 2100 kev fluence of @xmath41 erg@xmath3 for short bursts from sgr1806@xmath1520 and sgr1900@xmath014 ( e.g. , @xcite ) studied so far .",
    "thus , the high sensitivity of suzaku allowed us to study , for the first time , the wide - band properties of these low - fluence bursts . assuming the effective duration of the 31 short bursts from sgr0501@xmath04516 to be 0.1 s , which is a typical value for this type of events ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we calculated the flux ( luminosity ) and the blackbody radii , all averaged over the 31 short bursts , and show the results in table [ tab : spc_summary ] .",
    "the effective emission radii of the two bb components , @xmath114 km and @xmath11.9 km ( assuming a distance of 4 kpc ) , are comparable to typical values found in short bursts from sgr1806@xmath1520 and sgr1900@xmath014 @xcite , and from sgr0501@xmath04516 @xcite , although the distance uncertainty remains .",
    "using the suzaku too observation of sgr0501@xmath04516 conducted in 2008 august , we studied relatively dim 31 short bursts from this new magnetar .",
    "their average fluence , @xmath2 erg@xmath3 in 240 kev , is 12 orders of magnitude lower than those of typical short burst studied so far ( e.g. , @xcite ) . following the detection of a hard component from the persistent emission of sgr0501@xmath04516 ( paperii ; @xcite ) , the data have allowed a clear detection of a similar hard - tail component in the spectrum summed over the 31 short bursts .",
    "these results for the first time reveal spectral properties of such dim bursts , and provide a new clue to the formation mechanisms of persistent and burst emissions from magnetars .",
    "as already reported in paperi , the spectrum of the strongest burst ( actually its precursor ) from sgr0501@xmath04516 was well reproduced by a 2bb model , without indication of an additional hard x - ray component . however",
    ", this could be due to the effect mentioned in section [ intro ] , namely , obscuration by the high 2bb temperatures ( @xmath42 kev ) ; the data of this strong precursor are worth searching for a hard tail component .",
    "therefore , we re - analyzed the same pile - up and dead - time corrected spectrum of the precursor as studied in paperi , using the 2bb@xmath0pl model .",
    "the photon index was fixed to @xmath43 to emulate the results obtained in subsection [ sec : spc_ana ] , and the photoelectric absorption was again fixed to @xmath34 @xmath3 after paperi .",
    "the fit resulted in @xmath4/d.o.f .",
    "= 40.1/37 = 1.09 , which is no better than the value of 41.2/38 = 1.08 using the 2bb model .",
    "therefore , the data do not require any excess hard - tail component with @xmath44 .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters are summarized in table [ tab : spc_summary ] , which are consistent with the results in paperi after renormalizing to the distance of 4 kpc and the duration of 0.2 s. there , the 2100 kev flux of the pl component is given as a 90% upper limit .",
    "given the gross spectral similarity between the short bursts and the persistent emission of sgr0501@xmath04516 ( subsection [ sec : spc_ana ] ) , let us perform more quantitative comparison among their soft components , referring to figure [ fig : comp_kt_r ] which summarizes three sets of 2bb parameters of sgr0501@xmath04516 ; the persistent emission , the 31 short bursts , and the precursor of the strongest burst .",
    "there , we find three properties that are common to all the three spectra .",
    "one is that the cooler and hotter blackbodies have comparable luminosities , and another is that @xmath17 is @xmath45 times higher than @xmath18 .",
    "these 2bb properties are considered rather intrinsic to magnetars , because they also apply to more energetic ( typically by an order of magnitude in bolometric fluence ) bursts from sgr1806@xmath1520 and sgr1900@xmath014 observed with hete-2 ( figure 5 of @xcite ) , sgr1900@xmath014 observed with swift @xcite , and sgr0501@xmath04516 observed with swift @xcite , as well as to persistent emission from some other magnetars ( @xcite and references therein ) . the remaining property found in figure [ fig : comp_kt_r ]",
    "is that the two temperatures increase with the luminosity .",
    "in fact , the temperature of the 31 short bursts are by a factor of 49 lower than those of the typical bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this justifies a posteriori our conjecture made in section [ intro ] , i.e. , a positive temperature - luminosity correlation of the 2bb component .",
    "incidentally , the ratio increase in figure [ fig : spc_ratio ] , from a few kev to @xmath46 kev , is at least partially due to the higher 2bb temperatures of the dim bursts than those of the persistent emission .",
    "in contrast to the present results , some published results ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest a weak negative correlation between the 2bb temperatures and the burst fluence . however , these results are usually limited to rather strong bursts with fluence @xmath20 erg @xmath3 .",
    "then , the temperature vs. fluence might change at about this fluence .",
    "alternatively , weaker bursts in these studies may have actually contained hard - tail components , and hence their spectra appeared rather hard .",
    "in addition to these similarities in the soft component , the presence of a distinct pl - shaped hard component , found in the present work , provides a novel resemblance between the 31 short bursts and the persistent emission . moreover ,",
    "the photon index of the former , @xmath47 , is consistent with the latter , @xmath48 ( paperii ) .",
    "however , as already visualized by figure [ fig : spc_ratio ] , the two phenomena can differ in their ratios between the 240 kev hard - component luminosity @xmath49 and the bolometric soft - component luminosity @xmath50 , even excluding the effect caused by different bb temperatures .",
    "we observed @xmath51 from the 31 short bursts , which is possibly higher than that of @xmath52 for the persistent emission at 2.6@xmath7 level . here ,",
    "quoted errors are 68% confidence levels for the ratios , and 90% confidence levels for the photon indices .    in order to visualize the wide - band spectral hardness , we compare in figure [ fig : lbb_lpl ] the relations between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "there , @xmath49 was calculated again in the 240 kev range . even though the @xmath55 ratio could vary to some extent",
    ", a fact of basic importance is that @xmath49 and @xmath50 increases , by about 2 orders of magnitude in an approximate proportion , from the persistent emission to the dim short bursts .",
    "this , together with the spectral similarities discussed above , suggests that common emission mechanisms operate between these short bursts and the persistent emission .",
    "this in turn gives a support to our idea that persistent x - ray emission of magnetars may in general consist of numerous micro - bursts @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the upper limit on the @xmath55 ratio obtained for the strongest burst is considerably lower than is extrapolated from the other two less luminous data points , suggesting some changes in the emission mechanism from weaker to stronger short bursts .",
