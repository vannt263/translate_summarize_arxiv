    "the unconventional temperature scaling of the in plane resistivity in high-@xmath3 cuprates has been of considerable interest for many years .",
    "it is now widely accepted that overdoped cuprates exhibit a @xmath4-linear resistivity at high temperature which crosses over to a @xmath5 dependence at lower temperature [ ] .",
    "the onset of the linear temperature dependence appears to coincide with the onset of superconductivity and the crossover temperature to a conventional @xmath5 dependence drops monotonically with the doping level to zero , roughly around optimal doping [ ] .",
    "hussey and collaborators measured the resistivity on a number of cuprates particularly the single layer tl2201 in the overdoped region [ ] and lsco into the underdoped region [ ] . very recently the barii et al .",
    "[ ] reported results for the resistivity for more cuprates , e.g. hg1201 and ybco over a wider density range .",
    "they found that when the resistivity was normalized to a give a resistance per cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquette , @xmath6 , universal results for all cuprates followed with identical coefficients .",
    "further they argued for a universal trend in both the linear @xmath7 and quadratic @xmath8 regimes , with the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 proportional to @xmath11 , the inverse hole density .",
    "as barii et al .",
    "[ ] remarked , if one uses a drude formula for resistance , this behavior is indicative of a carrier density that is proportional to the density of holes rather than electrons .",
    "such behavior is consistent with a doped mott insulator scenario .",
    "anderson [ ] has argued that the cuprates as doped mott insulators should be in the strong coupling regime of the hubbard model at all hole densities .",
    "he has put forward the hidden fermi liquid [ hfl ] ansatz to describe the connection between the fermi surface before gutzwiller projection and the electronic state that results from the removal of doubly occupied states by gutzwiller projection .",
    "this hfl ansatz gives a resistivity with the observed temperature dependence , crossing over from a linear to a quadratic form as the temperature is lowered .",
    "an earlier viewpoint interprets the cuprate phase diagram in terms of an underlying quantum critical point separating the overdoped and underdoped regions . in these theories",
    "the effective interactions between electrons are mediated and controlled by the order parameter fluctuations associated with the quantum critical point [ ] .",
    "another approach recently put forward by kokalj and coworkers [ ] is based on an anisotropic marginal fermi liquid self energy .",
    "their phenomenological theory gives good fits to the resistivity and also to the angular dependent magnetoresistance [ admr ] results [ ] and a number of other properties .        in an earlier study , which employed a functional renormalization group [ frg ] treatment of the two - dimensional hubbard model to describe the overdoped region , ossadnik et al .",

    "they found an anisotropic term in the quasiparticle scattering rate with an angular form similar to the experiment and with an unconventional @xmath4-linear dependence which increased when approaching optimal doping starting from the overdoped side .",
    "they argued that this unusual term appearing in the imaginary part in the quasiparticle self - energy could lead also to an equivalent temperature dependence for the in - plane resistivity .",
    "the goal of this study is to expand this idea and move beyond a self energy analysis of the transport properties to a full calculation of transport properties using solutions of the boltzmann equation .",
    "this is possible within a frg approach since the method computes the strongly renormalized quasiparticle interactions .",
    "we determine the matrix elements for the scattering events within the frg framework presented in [ ] and use numerical techniques to solve the linearized boltzmann equation .",
    "a detailed numerical treatment is required in view of the strong anisotropy in the transport life times [ ] due to both the anisotropic quasiparticle interactions and the strongly angle dependent fermi velocities introduced by the anisotropy of the band structure .",
    "the importance of full transport calculations was stressed by hlubina and rice in an early paper [ ] .    as will be discussed later ,",
    "our calculations agree qualitatively with the unconventional temperature dependence but the magnitude of the resistance is substantially lower .",
    "this disagreement in the absolute values is in line with the restrictions on @xmath12 required to justify the one - loop approximation in the frg .",
    "another discrepancy between our numerical results and the experiment is the lack of scaling of the resistance coefficients , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath11 the inverse hole density as reported by barii et al .",

    "[ ] where the unconventional temperature dependence of the scattering rates through the rg flow were described .    at high temperature , however , the growth of the linear - temperature term when the doping is decreased toward optimal doping , is mainly due to the fermi surface geometry and the temperature dependence of the scattering volume , while the momentum anisotropy of the scattering interaction is responsible for the enhanced value of the resistivity .",
    "in the cuprates the resistivity is caused by electron - electron interactions which raises the question , how the total momentum of the entire distribution function is relaxed . in the following",

    "note that the fermi surface has to be sufficiently large in order to allow for umklapp assisted scattering between different momenta on the fermi surface .    for a square lattice we can distinguish between two kinds of umklapp scatterings : with momentum transfers of the type @xmath89 and @xmath90 to the lattice .",
