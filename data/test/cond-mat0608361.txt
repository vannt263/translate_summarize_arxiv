    "acoustic vibrational modes in nanoparticles are impulsively excited by a rapid heating of the lattice that takes place after laser excitation@xcite .",
    "after initial period of rapid expansion , a nanoparticle undergoes radial contractions and expansions around the new equilibrium .",
    "the periodic change in nanoparticle volume translates into a modulation in time of the surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) energy that dominates nanoparticle optical absorption spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of vibrational modes manifests itself via coherent oscillations of differential transmission at spr energy measured using ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy@xcite . since the size of laser spot is usually much larger than nanoparticle diameter ,",
    "the initial expansion is homogeneous so that predominantly the fundamental ( @xmath0 ) breathing mode , corresponding to oscillations of nanoparticle volume as a whole , is excited .",
    "the lowest excited ( @xmath1 ) mode has weaker oscillator strength ( @xmath2 of that for @xmath0 ) and thus is more difficult to observe . when nanoparticle is embedded in a dielectric medium , the oscillations are damped due to the transfer of latice energy to acoustic waves in surrounding dielectric . in solid and bimetallic particles , the size dependences of eigenmodes",

    ", the spr can be tuned in a wide energy interval @xcite .",
    "recent pump - probe measurements of vibrational modes dynamics in gold nanoshells submerged in water revealed characteristic oscillation pattern of differential transmission . however , the oscillations period and amplitude as well as their damping were significantly larger than those for solid nanoparticles .",
    "we perform detailed analysis of energy spectrum of lowest vibrational modes of a nanoshell in a dielectric medium .",
    "we find that the modes eigenenergies exhibit a strong dependence on nanoshell aspect ratio , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are inner and outer radii , respectively .",
    "specifically , for thin nanoshells , the fundamental mode energy is consirerably lower than for solid particles while the damping is significantly larger . at the same time , in the thin shell limit , the fundamental mode carries the _ entire _ oscillator strength which results in an enhanced oscillations amplitude as compared to solid particles .",
    "the analysis also reveals two regimes , where the spectrum is dominated by nanoslell geometry or by surrounding medium , with a sharp crossover governed by the interplay between aspect ratio and impendance .",
    "we consider radial normal modes of a spherical nanoshell with dielectric core extending up to inner radius @xmath4 in a dielectric medium beyond outer radius @xmath5 .",
    "the acoustical properties of the system are characterized by the densities @xmath6 and the longitudinal and tranverse sound velocities @xmath7 , where @xmath8 stands for core , shell , amd medium , respectively .",
    "the radial displacement @xmath9 is determined from helmholtz equation ( at zero angular momentum ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wave - vector , with the boundary conditions that the displacement @xmath12 and the radial component of stress tensor , @xmath13 , \\label{stress}\\ ] ] are continuous at the core / shell and shell / medium interfaces . in the three regions divided by shell boundaries , the displacement has the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the phase mismatch .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies are , in general , complex due to energy transfer to the outgoing wave in the surrounding medium . after matching @xmath9 and @xmath16 at @xmath17",
    ", we obtain the following equations for eigenvalues @xmath18",
    "@xmath19    where @xmath20 is nanoshell aspect ratio , and the parameters @xmath21 characterize the metal / dielectric interfaces . in the ideal case of a nanoshell in vacuum , described by stress - free boundary conditions at both interfaces",
    ", we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for a thin nanoshell , @xmath24",
    ", we then easily recover the known expression for the fundamental mode @xcite @xmath25 the eigenvalue is , of course , purely real since no energy leaks through the interface .    in the realistic case of a nanoshell in a medium , the role of dielectric core",
    "is diminished .",
    "the laser pulse causes faster expansion of the metal shell than of dielectric core .",
    "indeed , the heating of au lattice is due to the cooling of electron gas that occurs during several ps , while the heating of dielectric core due to heat transfer from metal to dielectric takes place on a longer time scale@xcite . because a larger metal thermal expansion coefficient as compared to that of core dielectric , the shell expands to a greater extent than the dielectric core . as a result ,",
    "in the new equilibrium , the core and the shell are , in fact , no longer in contact , so the boundary conditions at he core / shell interface should be be taken as stress - free .",
    "this can be accomplished by setting @xmath26 . for a thin nanoshell , @xmath27 , eqs .",

    ". note that if the medium transverse sound speed is zero ( e. g. , in water ) , then @xmath39 and both the energy and damping rate vanish . in the second regime , corresponding to @xmath40 , the spectrum can be obtained as @xmath41 ,   \\label{lambda - small}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the real part , in a good approximation , is given by @xmath42 , and is independent of medium or aspect ratio , while the imaginary part , although small ( @xmath43 ) , depends on both .",
