    "depending on the nature of the independent variables , it is well known that the full thermodynamic description of a given system requires the availability of either one of the thermodynamic potentials or of the corresponding equations of state . in the case of classical fluids ,",
    "the usual expression for the equation of state ( eos ) is a relationship among the pressure @xmath4 , the density @xmath5 and the temperature @xmath6 of the fluid .",
    "however , except for very few ideal systems , the explicit ( exact ) form of this relationship is not known in general . therefore , given the fact that an experimental determination of the eos for every particular fluid is of course not practical , researchers have concentrated their efforts in proposing  `` reasonable '' empirical or semi - empirical approximations .",
    "perhaps the neatest example of such an approach , already produced over a century ago and providing an essentially correct qualitative picture of the thermodynamic properties of gases and liquids , is the celebrated van der waals eos@xcite .",
    "an alternative proposal , first introduced by kammerlingh onnes@xcite as a mathematical representation of experimental results on the equation of state of gases and liquids , is the so called virial equation of state . written for the compressibility factor @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant ) as a power series in @xmath5 , it provides an expansion that gives the deviation from ideal gas behaviour in ascending powers of the density , namely    @xmath9    here , the @xmath10 are the virial coefficients . for a simple fluid ,",
    "the virial coefficients are in general functions of @xmath6 alone , while in the case of mixtures they also depend on composition@xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of the virial equation of state , discovered many years after it was introduced , is the fact that it can be derived rigorously using statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that the virial coefficients are not merely empirical constants but are rather related to intermolecular interactions in a well - defined manner .",
    "it is unfortunate , however , that in general the actual computation of the virial coefficients is a formidable task and that the radius of convergence of the series in eq .",
    "( [ 1v ] ) is not known .    in the case of hard - core fluids ( rods , discs , spheres and hyperspheres )",
    "the virial coefficients are easier to compute than those corresponding to any other intermolecular interactions . even in these model systems and with the exception of hard rods , where the exact eos and corresponding virial coefficients are known ,",
    "only the first few of such coefficients are available so far@xcite because the number of cluster integrals involved increases very rapidly with the order of the coefficient .",
    "the availability is scarcer for mixtures than for simple fluids , although recently there has been renewed interest in partially remedying this deficiency @xcite .",
    "the limited knowledge of the virial coefficients has proved useful , however , in the sense that proposals for the eos of these systems may be judged amongst other things by how well the virial coefficients arising in such proposals compare with the exact values .",
    "the rationale here is that a `` good '' theoretical eos should lead to an accurate prediction of the value of the virial coefficients .",
    "alternatively , the few available virial coefficients may also be profitably used to construct a rational ( pad or levin)@xcite aproximation to the eos or to guide in the construction of a theoretical eos , as was the case with the carnahan - starling ( cs ) eos@xcite for a simple hard - sphere fluid .    a variety of ( approximate )",
    "eos for simple fluids composed of hard discs and hard spheres are available in the literature@xcite and some work has also been reported on simple fluids of hard hyperspheres @xcite .",
    "very recently we introduced a simple recipe to derive the compressibility factor of a multicomponent mixture of @xmath0-dimensional hard hyperspheres in terms of that of the corresponding single component system@xcite .",
    "a straightforward consequence of such a recipe is that one can easily derive the explicit expressions for the virial coefficients of the mixture in terms of those of the single component fluid for all @xmath0 .",
    "the major aim of this paper is to further assess the usefulness of our recipe by comparing the predictions of the values of the virial coefficients of binary mixtures of hard discs , hard spheres and hard hyperspheres in @xmath11 and @xmath12 with those obtained through monte carlo integration . along the way we will introduce slight modifications to our original proposal and consider an alternative eos to cope with mixtures very disparate in size .",
    "this new eos is consistent with the forms suggested by wheatley for the virial coefficients of hard discs @xcite and hard spheres @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section and in order to make the paper",
    "self - contained , we will briefly recall the main results of our previous work and write down explicitly the composition - independent virial coefficients of a @xmath0-dimensional binary mixture of ( additive ) hard hyperspheres .",
    "section [ sec3 ] deals with a new proposal for the eos of the binary mixture that attempts to incorporate additional features not present in the original recipe . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we focus on the case of hard spheres because of its intrinsic interest .",
    "we close the paper in section [ sec5 ] with an assessment of the different results .",
    "some mathematical details of our derivations are presented in two appendices .",
    "in this section we first consider a multicomponent mixture of @xmath0-dimensional ( additive ) hard hyperspheres and then restrict ourselves to _ binary _ mixtures of hard hyperspheres in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "let the number of components be @xmath13 , the total number density of the mixture be @xmath5 , the set of mole fractions be @xmath14 , and the set of diameters be @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the packing fraction is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 @xmath19 is the partial packing fraction due to species @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the partial number density corresponding to species @xmath20 , @xmath22 is the volume of a @xmath0-dimensional sphere of unit diameter and @xmath23 . in previous work",
    "@xcite we proposed a simple equation of state for the mixture , @xmath24 , consistent with a given eos for a single component system , @xmath25 , at the same packing fraction @xmath26 , namely @xmath27 2^{1-d}\\delta _ { 0}+ \\frac{\\eta } { 1-\\eta } \\left ( 1-\\delta _ { 0}+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta _ { 1}\\right ) , \\label{4.1}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 in the one - dimensional case , eq .",

    "the same situation appears if @xmath62 or @xmath63 , which means that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is verified as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "a subtler consistency condition is @xcite @xmath66 which ensures that the derivative of the excess free energy of mixing with respect to @xmath42 is zero when the spheres are of the same size @xcite . in the approximation (",
    "[ 11 ] ) , eq .",

    "( [ 23 ] ) .",

    "( [ 22 ] ) is equivalent to enforcement of eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "the property ( [ 26 ] ) guarantees that the condition ( [ 25 ] ) is fulfilled by the coefficients ( [ 11.1])([11.3 ] ) .",
    "the most stringent conditions appear in the limits @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in that case , eq .  ( [ 11 ] ) yields b_n_1,n_2^ ( ) = \\ {    ll v_d^n-1 & ( 0 ) , + v_d^n-1^d & ( ) .    .",
    "[ 12 ] on the other hand , the _ exact _ result is @xcite b_n_1,n_2^ ( ) = \\ {    llv_d^n-1b_n_2 & ( 0 ) , + v_d^n-1^db_n_1 & ( ) .    . [ 13 ] the above condition means that in the limit of infinite size asymmetry , the smaller spheres contribute to the total pressure as if they were a one - component system in a free volume equal to the total volume minus the volume occupied by the larger spheres .",
    "our approximation ( [ 11])([11.3 ] ) gives the correct forms for the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath73 , but not the correct coefficients ( except for @xmath74 in the limit @xmath71 and for @xmath75 in the limit @xmath76 , apart from the trivial cases @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "in fact , in our approximation the virial coefficient @xmath10 depends parametrically on @xmath33 only , and not on the previous coefficients @xmath79 , as is needed in eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the form of our approximation in which the compressibility factor of the mixture at a given packing fraction @xmath26 is expressed in terms of the compressibility factor of the monodisperse system at the _ same _ packing fraction .",
    "another consistency condition is @xcite @xmath80 this comes from the exact value of the derivative of the excess free energy with respect to molecular size in the limit of infinite size asymmetry @xcite . in general , this condition is not verified by our approximation either .",
    "we consider the condition ( [ 13 ] ) to be more important than ( [ 13bis ] ) because it is not restricted to @xmath81 ( or @xmath75 ) and also because it refers to the leading term in the limit of infinite size asymmetry , while the condition ( [ 13bis ] ) refers to the sub - leading term .",

    "in this paper we have further assessed the merits and limitations of a simple recipe recently introduced@xcite to derive the compressibility factor of a multicomponent mixture of @xmath0-dimensional hard spheres .",
    "we have now considered the case of binary mixtures and looked in particular at the composition - independent virial coefficients .",
    "the comparison with the available exact and simulation results confirmed the usefulness of our approach except perhaps when the mixture involves components of very disparate sizes ( especially for high dimensionalities ) .",
    "guided by the conditions that the virial coefficients must fulfill in certain limits , a slight modification of the form of the original coefficients was made , trying to sacrifice simplicity as less as possible while at the same time improving the accuracy of their numerical predictions .",
    "it is fair to state that the ( modified ) composition - independent virial coefficients are in excellent agreement with the reported values for all dimensions and all size ratios .    due to its particular relevance , the case of the binary mixture of hard spheres @xmath82",
    "was analyzed in some detail , both in connection with the virial coefficients and through the consideration of different eos for this system that exist in the literature .",
    "as for the virial coefficients , the trends pointed out above about the reliability of the original and modified prescriptions hold also for @xmath3 . the comparison with the simulation results for the compressibility factor of these mixtures given in tables",
    "[ table3 ] and [ table4 ] indicates the superiority of the original recipe for the eos provided one uses the cs eos for @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the more accurate rescaled pad approximation for @xmath25 is used , it is the new eos ( [ 40 ] ) ( i.e. , the one obtained after resumming the virial series with the modified coefficients ) which gives the best performance , although only slightly better than @xmath24 as given by eq .",
    "( [ 4.1 ] ) with @xmath83 .",
    "both equations are also of comparable accuracy to the one of the presumably best eos available presently for hard - sphere mixtures , namely the rescaled pad approximant for mixtures introduced by malijevsk and veverka @xcite .",
    "this latter equation of state rests on a different philosophy , however , in the sense that it makes use of the known virial coefficients of the mixture rather than the @xmath84 , as in our approach and those of hamad @xcite and barrio and solana @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
