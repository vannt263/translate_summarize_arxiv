    "the chemically peculiar ( cp ) star hd103498 ( 65umad , hr4561 ) is a member of a multiple - system which consists of four objects . according to pourbaix et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , hd103498 is a south - eastern component of the visual binary ads8347 ( separation 63@xmath0 ) containing hr4561 and hr4560 with the latter being a spectroscopic binary 65umaac .",
    "abt & morrell ( @xcite ) classified it as crsreu based on low - resolution cassegrain photographic spectrum .",
    "the first magnetic field measurements of 65umad were reported by bychkov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who discovered a rather strong negative longitudinal magnetic field @xmath1 of about @xmath2  g. using the musicos spectropolarimeter attached to 2.0-m telescope bernard lyot ( tbl ) at observatoire du pic du midi , france , aurire  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) measured much weaker longitudinal field @xmath1 , that varied between @xmath3200  g with a period of 15.83 days .",
    "the authors derived rotational velocity @xmath4=13  kms@xmath5 and estimated an effective temperature @xmath6=9220@xmath3300  k and luminosity @xmath7=2.06@xmath30.20 of the star .",
    "the strmgren indices of hd103498 are @xmath8 = 0.003 , @xmath9 = 0.196 , @xmath10 = 1.010 and @xmath11 = 2.858 ( hauck & mermilliod @xcite ) . on the basis of the peculiar indices and ap spectral classification , hd103498 was observed using high - speed photometric technique as a part of survey programme for searching photometric variability in the cp stars .",
    "tiwari et al . ( @xcite ) reported a 15-min periodic oscillation with varying amplitude from night to night .",
    "the location of this star in the h - r diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ hr ] ) towards the larger luminosity and higher temperature than any roap star observed till now , makes it an unusual pulsator .",
    "therefore , we continued further photometric monitoring of this star .",
    "in addition , we obtained the time - series spectroscopy to search for possible rapid radial velocity ( rv ) variations because in almost all known roap stars , the rv amplitudes exceed the photometric amplitudes significantly and the pulsational signal may be detected in rv with no detection in the photometry ( hatzes & mkrtichian @xcite  @xmath12crb ; kochukhov et al .",

    "to search the photometric light variations in the short period ( @xmath13 min ) pulsating variables , high - speed photometry is an established technique and is being used since 1980s .",
    "the high - speed photometric observations of hd103498 was carried out using a three - channel fast photometer attached to the 1.04-m sampurnanand telescope of aries which is situated at altitude @xmath131950-m above the sea level with longitude of 79@xmath14 e and latitude 29@xmath15",
    "n having average fwhm seeing of the order of 2@xmath0 ( ashoka et al .",

    "we obtained time - series photometric data through a johnson @xmath16-filter with an integrations of 10-sec each for a total duration of 36-hrs ( table [ log ] ) .",
    "an aperture of 30@xmath0 was used to minimize flux variations caused by seeing fluctuations and guiding .",
    "the centering of the star was checked using manual guiding in a non - periodic time - interval .",
    "the data reduction processes involves the following steps : ( a ) visual inspection of the light curve to identify and remove the bad data points ; ( b ) correction for coincident counting losses ; ( c ) subtraction of the interpolated sky background and ( d ) correction for the mean atmospheric extinction . after applying these corrections , the times of the mid - points of each data points are converted into heliocentric julian dates ( hjd ) with an accuracy of @xmath17 day ( @xmath131-sec ) .",
    "the reduced data comprised of a time - series of the hjd and @xmath18b magnitudes with respect to the mean values of the run ( light curve ) .",
    "the frequency analysis was performed using deeming s discrete fourier transform ( dft ) for unequally spaced data ( deeming @xcite ) .",

    "each arc frame was wavelength - calibrated to the internal precision of 5060  ms@xmath5 using @xmath211500 emission lines in all echelle orders .",
    "a rv drift of 120  ms@xmath5 was measured between the two thar exposures .",
    "this change of the spectrograph s zero point , as well as a small change of the heliocentric rv that occurred during our observations , was compensated by subtracting a straight line fit from the rv measurements of the individual lines and spectral regions .",
    "in addition to fies data we also used one of the musicos spectra employed for magnetic field measurements ( aurire  et  al .",
    "this spectrum , kindly provided to us by g. wade , was obtained at jd=2452255.73 close to the phase of magnetic minimum with the signal - to - noise ratio about 200 , and with the spectral resolution of @xmath22 .",

    "we performed full spectroscopic analysis of hd103498 to identify its evolutionary status and the chemical peculiarities .",
    "abundance study of the star was based primarily on the averaged spectrum of our time - series spectroscopy in the spectral region 39007270  .",
    "we also repeated abundance analysis using the musicos spectrum and obtained results in agreement with those derived from the averaged fies spectrum within the errors of abundance determination . for hydrogen line profiles we used the musicos spectrum where continuum is better defined in the region of the line wings .",
    "atmospheric parameters of hd103498 were estimated using calibration of strmgren ( moon & dworetsky @xcite ) and geneva photometry ( kunzli  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) realized in the package templogg ( kaiser @xcite ) .",

    "a reasonable fit of the calculated h@xmath24 and h@xmath12 line profiles to the observed ones was obtained with the following atmospheric parameters : @xmath6=9500  k , @xmath23=3.6 ( fig.[hydrogen ] ) .",

    "we did not use parallax value 3.37 mas of the star as given by van leeuwen ( @xcite ) for an individual object .",
    "if hd103498 ( 65  uma  d ) and 65  uma  ac comprise a physical pair ( pourbaix et al .",
    "@xcite ) , then both stars should have similar parallaxes .",

    "reddening parameter @xmath25=0.007 and interstellar absorption @xmath26=0.021  mag were estimated from the ubv photometric data of huchra & willner ( @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite ) . position of hd  103498 on hr diagram ( see fig.[hr ] ) provides an additional support for the lower gravity derived from hydrogen line profiles compared to photometric calibrations .",
    "identification of lines in the spectrum of hd103498 was based on the theoretical spectrum calculated for the entire observed spectral region using the line extraction from  ( kupka et al . @xcite and references therein ) and dream ( bimont et al .",
    "@xcite ) databases .",
    "atomic data on the rare - earth elements ( ree ) compiled in the dream database were extracted via the vald interface .",
    "comparison of the synthetic and observed spectra allowed us to choose the least blended lines for the abundance analysis .",
    "direct comparison of hd103498 spectrum with spectrum of well - studied ap star hd133792 ( kochukhov  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) shows a pronounced similarity between two objects : both spectra are crowded with strong lines of fe - peak elements while the lines of the ree are weak or absent .",
    "crii and feii lines with the lower level excitation energy above 10 ev are numerous and many of them are rather strong , which is an indication of the extreme cr and fe overabundances in stellar atmosphere .",
    "lte abundance determination is based mainly on the equivalent widths analysed with the improved version of  code updated for the output line lists and kindly provided to us by v. tsymbal .",
    "model atmosphere was calculated with the  code ( kurucz @xcite ) using a metallicity @xmath27=+0.5 $ ] . to make a proper selection of unblended and minimally blended lines for abundance calculations we synthesized the whole observed spectral region 39657270    with the help of  code ( kochukhov @xcite ) .",
    "the best fit to the observed unblended line profiles was achieved for @xmath4=12  kms@xmath5 , in close agreement with @xmath4=13  kms@xmath5  derived by aurire  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) from the mean metal line profile .",
    "microturbulent velocity , = 1.0@xmath30.2  kms@xmath5 , was obtained as an averaged value between the values derived from numerous lines of cri , crii , fei , and feii .",
    "table  [ abundance ] summarizes the results of our abundance analysis . for each species",
    "an average abundance with rms based on n measured lines is given .",
    "for comparison we also give abundances in the atmospheres of two crfe - rich evolved ap stars hd133792 ( kochukhov  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and hd204411 ( ryabchikova  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and in the solar photosphere ( asplund  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the results show that hd103498 have the largest cr and fe overabundances among the three stars .",
    "it is also si - overabundant , but silicon seems to be stratified similar to hd133792 and hd204411 .",
    "calcium lines are weak and we analysed only one caii line @xmath28  6456.88   .",
    "trying to fit the resonance caii @xmath28  3933.66    line we found that description of the line core requires 10 times smaller abundance than the wings and the 6456.88    line .",
    "this indicates the presence of ca stratification similar to the one in hd133792 ( kochukhov  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and in hd 204411 ( ryabchikova  et  al .",
    "we also found that the core of caii  @xmath28  3933.66 is blue - shifted by @xmath130.02   .",
    "blue shift of this line was also found in hd133792 which is known to have strong ca isotopic anomaly ( see ryabchikova  et  al .",
    "@xcite , section 6 ) . to investigate the ca isotopic anomaly in hd103498 one needs spectral observations in the region of ir caii triplet that has the largest isotopic separation .",
    "spectral synthesis of the regions around resonance srii  @xmath28  4077 , 4215    as well as srii  @xmath28  4305  lines clearly shows that lines of cr and fe , not of srii , provide the main contribution to the observed strong features appearing at the position of the srii lines .",
    "in fact , the sr abundance in hd103498 does not exceeded much the solar one .",
    "thus , classification of the cr - rich stars as cr - sr based on low - resolution spectra may be incorrect .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that the two stars with substantial rotation , hd103498 and hd204411 , have the same small sr overabundance while hd133792 with negligible rotation is very sr - overabundant but has similar abundances of most other elements .      due to a substantial difference of the atmospheric parameters and spectral appearance of hd103498 compared to the known roap stars",
    ", we do not have an _ a priori _ information which lines might be most suitable for detection of the velocity oscillations . in this situation a cross - correlation analysis of large spectral regions appears to be the optimal approach to the spectroscopic search of pulsations . in roap stars metal lines",
    "exhibit a large scatter in the pulsation amplitude and phase , leading to a significant dilution of the signal coming from strongly pulsating lines by lines showing weak of no variation .",
    "however , even in this case cross - correlation studies are usually successful in detecting reliably oscillation signals with amplitudes as low as few ms@xmath5 ( e.g. , hatzes & mkrtichian @xcite ) .",
    "we applied the cross - correlation analysis to the individual echelle orders of the fies spectra of hd103498 .",
    "the time - resolved spectra were compared to the mean one using the chi - square criterion and the rv shift minimizing the chi - square was recorded .",
    "only the spectral regions containing absorption features deeper than 3% were included in the analysis .",
    "the rv curves obtained with this method were analysed using the standard discrete fourier transform ( ft ) technique .",
    "[ ft_cor ] shows the amplitude spectra for 7 consecutive echelle orders in the spectral region characterized by a high @xmath29 and a large line density .",
    "no statistically significant periodicity is evident .",
    "the highest noise peaks reach 1520  ms@xmath5 .",
    "we also analysed a mean rv curve obtained by combining the measurements for 16 echelle orders for which the best rv precision was achieved .",
    "the corresponding ft spectrum is shown in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ ft_cor ] .",
    "it reveals no oscillations stronger than @xmath30  ms@xmath5 .",

    "stars the lines of the ree in the first and second ionization stages usually show the highest rv amplitudes . in hd103498",
    "these lines are either practically absent ( reeii ) or rather weak ( reeiii ) , while the lines of fe - peak elements are numerous and strong .",
    "therefore a pulsation signal from the ree lines may be lost in cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we made center - of - gravity rv measurements of the individual lines of priii  @xmath31  5300 , 6867    and ndiii  @xmath31  4914 , 4927 , 5050 , 5102 , 5294 , 6327    and analysed resulting mean rv curve for the two ree species .",
    "the corresponding ft spectrum , shown in fig",

    "the detection of 15-min periodic oscillations in the photometric data of year 2007 followed by non - detection in the spectroscopic data of year 2009 are of vast importance .",
    "the possible reason for this phenomena may be significant intrinsic changes of the stellar pulsational amplitude .",
    "the absence of periodic light variations in the photometric data sets carried out during 2006,2008 and 2009 could be due to the fact that the real amplitude variations might be buried under the noise .",

    "the respective amplitude of the sky transparency variations and scintillation noise in year 1999 - 2000 are 7.23 and 0.50-mmag and the corresponding values for year 2008 - 2009 are 11.68 and 0.66-mmag , respectively .",
    "this clearly shows that the atmospheric noise has been increased slightly in last ten years owing to enhanced human activities around the observatory .",
    "the atmospheric noise can be minimized by installing bigger telescopes at a good observing site where the sky is stable and photometric ( young @xcite ) . towards this , aries is now in the process of installing 1.3-m and 3.6-m optical telescopes at a new astronomical site , devasthal ( longitude : @xmath34 e , latitude : @xmath35 n , altitude : 2420-m ) by the end of year 2009 and 2012 , respectively .",

    "unfortunately , the magnetic ephemeris of hd103498 is not known with enough accuracy to establish the precise rotational phase of our observations . on the other hand ,",
    "we do not observe clear modulation of the photometric pulsational amplitude on the time scale of the rotation period which argues against such modulation in spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopic studies of a few roap stars which were followed over the entire rotation cycle ( e.g. , kochukhov @xcite ; mkrtichian & hatzes @xcite ) show that rv pulsation never disappears entirely .",

    "<S> we present the results on the photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of a luminous ap star hd103498 . </S>",
    "<S> the time - series photometric observations were carried out on 17 nights using three - channel fast photometer attached to the 1.04-m optical telescope at aries , nainital . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric data of five nights of year 2007 show clear signature of 15-min periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the follow - up observations during 20072009 could not repeated any such periodicity . to confirm the photometric light variations , </S>",
    "<S> the time - series spectroscopic observations were carried out with the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) at la palma on february 2 , 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> any radial velocity variations were absent in this data set which is in full agreement with the photometric observations taken near the same night . model atmosphere and abundance analysis of hd103498 show that the star is evolved from the main sequence and its atmospheric abundances are similar to two other evolved ap stars hd133792 and hd204411 : large overabundances of si , cr , and fe and moderate overabundances of the rare - earth elements . these chemical properties and a higher effective temperature distinguish hd103498 from any known roap star .    </S>",
