    "in recent years mechanical and optical degrees of freedom have become entangled experimentally by underlying mechanism of radiation pressure forces .",
    "this field known as cavity optomechanics has played a vital role in the conceptual exploration of the boundaries between classical and quantum mechanical systems .",
    "the coupling of mechanical and optical degrees of freedom via radiation pressure has been a subject of early research in the context of laser cooling @xcite and gravitational - wave detectors @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a great surge of interest in the application of radiation forces to manipulate the center - of - mass motion of mechanical oscillators covering a huge range of scales from macroscopic mirrors in the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) project @xcite to nano - mechanical cantilevers@xcite , vibrating microtoroids@xcite membranes@xcite .",
    "theoretical work has proposed to use the radiation - pressure coupling for quantum non - demolition measurements of the light field @xcite .",
    "recently , coupled dynamics of a movable mirror and atoms trapped in the standing wave light field of a cavity were studied @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the dipole potential in which the atoms move is modified due to the back - action of the atoms and that the position of the atoms can become bistable .",
    "new possibilities for cavity opto - mechanics may emerge by combining the tools of cavity quantum electrodynamics(qed ) with those of ultracold gases @xcite . placing an ensemble of atoms inside a high - finesse cavity enhances the atom - light interaction because the atoms collectively couple to the same light mode .",
    "the motional degrees of freedom of ultracold atomic gases represent a new source of long - lived coherence affecting light - atom interaction .",
    "nonlinear optics arising from this long - lived coherent motion of ultracold atoms trapped within a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity was reported recently @xcite .",
    "strong optical nonlinearities were observed even at low mean photon number of @xmath0 .",
    "this nonlinearity also gives rise to bistability in the transmitted probe light through the cavity .",
    "it is well known that by using a resonant optical cavity around a kerr medium , the quantum fluctuations of an incoming light beam can be reduced below the standard quantum - noise limit for a given quadrature component .",
    "the quantum optical properties of a mirror coupled via radiation pressure to a cavity field show interesting similarities to an intracavity kerr - like interaction @xcite and can be used to reduce quantum noise of light field reflected by such a cavity .    in this work ,",
    "we study another kind of kerr type medium , namely the collective motion of a trapped macroscopic ensemble of ultracold gas coupled to the intensity of the light field inside a cavity which serve as a mechanical oscillator ( analogous to a movable mirror ) .",
    "first we show how the optical force modifies the frequency and damping constant of the collective density excitations of the bec and further show the occurrence of normal mode splitting due to mixing of the optical mode and the bogoliubov mode .",
    "finally we demonstrate for the first time that the density excitations of the condensate can be used to reduce the quantum noise of the cavity field reflected by the bec .",
    "the role of the two - body interaction on the dynamics of the coupled system is also explored .",
    "this system may serve as an optomechanical control of quantum fluctuations using a bose einstein condensate .",
    "we consider an elongated cigar shaped bose - einstein condensate(bec ) of @xmath1 two - level @xmath2 atoms in the @xmath3 state with mass @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 of the @xmath6 transition of the @xmath7 line of @xmath2 , strongly interacting with a quantized single standing wave cavity mode of frequency @xmath8 . the standing wave that forms in the cavity results in an one - dimensional optical lattice potential . the cavity field",
    "is also coupled to external fields incident from one side mirror .",
    "it is well known that high - q optical cavities can significantly isolate the system from its environment , thus strongly reducing decoherence and ensuring that the light field remains quantum - mechanical for the duration of the experiment .",
    "we also assume that the induced resonance frequency shift of the cavity is much smaller than the longitudinal mode spacing , so that we restrict the model to a single longitudinal mode . in order to create an elongated bec",
    ", the frequency of the harmonic trap along the transverse direction should be much larger than one in the axial ( along the direction of the optical lattice ) direction .",
    "the system is also coherently driven by a laser field with frequency @xmath9 through the cavity mirror with amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "this system is modeled by the opto - mechanical hamiltonian @xmath11 in a rotating wave and dipole approximation .",
    "@xmath12-i\\eta(\\hat{a}-\\hat{a}^{\\dagger})\\,\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the large atom - pump and cavity - pump detuning , respectively . here",
    "@xmath15 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the atom - field coupling is written as @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the annihilation operator for a cavity photon .",
    "the input laser field populates the intracavity mode which couples to the atoms through the dipole interaction .",
    "the field in turn is modified by the back - action of the atoms .",
    "the system we are considering is intrinsically open as the cavity field is damped by the photon - leakage through the massive coupling mirror . since the detuning @xmath18 is large , spontaneous emission is negligible and we can adiabatically eliminate the excited state using the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "this yields the single particle hamiltonian    @xmath20 - i\\eta(\\hat{a}-\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}).\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath21 is the optical lattice barrier height per photon and represents the atomic backaction on the field .",
    "@xmath22 is the external classical potential . here",
    "we will always take @xmath23 . in this case the condensate is attracted to the nodes of the light field and hence the lowest bound state is localized at these positions which leads to a reduced coupling of the condensate to the cavity compared to that for @xmath24 .",
    "along @xmath25 , the cavity field forms an optical lattice potential of period @xmath26 and depth ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we now write the hamiltonian in a second quantized form including the two body interaction term .    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the field operator for the atoms .",
    "here @xmath30 is the two body @xmath31-wave scattering length .",
    "the corresponding opto - mechanical - bose - hubbard ( ombh ) hamiltonian can be derived by writing @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the wannier function and @xmath34 is the corresponding annihilation operator for the bosonic atom at the @xmath35 site . retaining only the lowest band with nearest neighbor interaction , we have    @xmath36    where    @xmath37    the ombh hamiltonian derived above is valid only for weak atom - field nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the nearest neighbor nonlinear interaction terms are usually very small compared to the onsite interaction and are neglected as usual .",
    "we now write down the heisenberg - langevin equation of motion for the bosonic field operator @xmath34 and the internal cavity mode @xmath17 as    @xmath38    @xmath39    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 characterizes the dissipation of the cavity field and collective density excitations of the bec resectively . here , we follow a semi - classical theory by considering _ noncommuting _ noise operators for the input field , i.e. , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and a _ classical _ thermal noise input for the bec oscillator , i.e.  @xmath44 , @xmath45 , in eqs .",
    "( [ lngvn1],[lngvn2 ] ) .",
    "the thermal noise input for the bec is provided by the thermal cloud of atoms and can be considered classical when @xmath46 .",
    "here @xmath47 is the temperature of the thermal reservoir .",
    "the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the equilibrium occupation numbers for the mechanical bec and optical oscillators , respectively .",
    "we consider a deep lattice formed by a strong classical potential @xmath50 , so that the overlap between wannier functions is small .",
    "thus , we can neglect the contribution of tunneling by putting @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "under this approximation , the matter - wave dynamics is not essential for light scattering . in experiments ,",
    "such a situation can be realized because the time scale of light measurements can be much faster than the time scale of atomic tunneling .",
    "one of the well - known advantages of the optical lattices is their extremely high tunability .",
    "thus , tuning the lattice potential , tunneling can be made very slow  @xcite .",
    "here we show that the coupling of the cavity field fluctuations and the condensate fluctuations ( bogoliubov mode ) leads to the splitting of the normal mode into two modes ( normal mode splitting(nms ) ) .",
    "the optomechanical nms however involves driving two parametrically coupled nondegenerate modes out of equilibrium .",
    "the nms does not appear in the steady state spectra but rather manifests itself in the fluctuation spectra of the mirror displacement . to this end , we shift the canonical variables to their steady - state values ( i.e.  @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) and linearize to obtain the following heisenberg - langevin equations :    @xmath55    @xmath56    here , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the detuning with respect to the renormalized resonance . in deriving the above equation",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath61 the steady state value of @xmath62 to be real .",
    "@xmath1 is the total number of atoms in @xmath63 sites .",
    "as before , we assume negligible tunneling ( @xmath64 ) and hence we drop the site index @xmath65 from the atomic operators .. we will always assume @xmath66 .",
    "we transform to the quadratures : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "note that the steady state values can be obtained by putting @xmath71 and @xmath72 in eqns.([lngvn1],[lngvn2 ] ) and solving for @xmath30 .",
    "this yields a cubic equation in @xmath30 which has three real solutions for certain values of the parameters . out of these three real solutions ,",
    "two are stable which represents bistability .",
    "the steady state values of @xmath62 and @xmath73 represent points far from the turning points in the bistable systems .",
    "the system reaches a steady state only if it is stable and the condition of stability can be obtained by applying the routh - hurwitz criterion to eqns .",
    "( [ h - l0],[h - l1 ] ) . in the following",
    "we will always be in the stable regime .",
    "the displacement spectrum of the condensate in fourier space for @xmath74 is found as    @xmath75,\\ ] ]    where ,    @xmath76    and the effective bogoliubov mechanical frequency ( @xmath77 ) and the effective bogoliubov mechanical damping ( @xmath78 ) @xmath79    and    @xmath80    here @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this spectrum is characterized by a mechanical susceptibility @xmath83 of the condensate that is driven by thermal noise ( @xmath84 ) and by the quantum fluctuations of the radiation pressure ( quantum back - action ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure 4 shows the normalized intensity squeezing spectrum versus normalized detuning ( @xmath85 ) and normalized frequency ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the parameters used for the left plot are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for the right plot , @xmath92 ( the lower value of @xmath93",
    "is obtained by lowering the atom - atom interaction @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 , @xmath88 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the @xmath96 parameter space ,",
    "squeezing of the output light intensity ( @xmath97 ) is indicated by the dark regions .",
    "higher the squeezing , darker the region . clearly , we find that the squeezing region in the parameter space @xmath96 decreases with decreasing two body atom - atom interaction .",
    "this is evident as we go from the left plot to the right plot .",
    "significant squeezing is observed for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these results can be easily explained from eqns . [ squeezing ] . as mentioned before thermal contribution destroys the squeezing . in order to ensure that the thermal noise contribution does not influence the squeezing @xmath100 ,",
    "the mechanical quality factor of the condensate has to be large ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "thus for the left plot of fig .",
    "4 , the mechanical quality factor @xmath102 and while for the right plot @xmath103 .",
    "this implies that the thermal noise contribution is enhanced for the right plot and as a consequence the spectrum @xmath100 exhibits less squeezing in the parameter space @xmath104 .",
    "further in order to observe enhanced squeezing , the bogoliubov mechanical frequency of the bec @xmath93 should be larger than the cavity linewidth @xmath40 .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing the atom - atom interaction @xmath94 . if @xmath105 , the cavity photons do not see any coherently variable collective position of the bec ( large amplitude of the bogoliubov mode ) but only small fluctuations of the collective position .",
    "this can also be interpreted in terms of the coherence length ( the coherence length is inversely proportional to @xmath106 ) .",
    "there are two length scales , the coherence length and the spatial scale of variation of the density . at low values of the interaction , the coherence length of the condensate is large and the quantum pressure term dominates the usual pressure term and hence the spatial variations of the density occurs on a length scale less than the coherence length . under this circumstance ,",
    "atoms behave as almost free particles . on the other hand ,",
    "when the interactions are large , the coherence length decreases and the spatial scale of variation of the density become large compared to the coherence length and hence the atoms move collectively .",
    "we will then require @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that when @xmath94 decreases , @xmath93 also decreases and approaches @xmath40 and hence a reduction in squeezing in the @xmath104 space is observed .    to demonstrate that the dynamics investigated here are within experimental reach",
    ", we discuss the experimental parameters from @xcite : a bec of typically @xmath108 @xmath109 atoms is coupled to the light field of an optical ultra high - finesse fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the atom - field coupling @xmath110 @xcite ( @xmath111 @xcite ) is greater than the decay rate of the intracavity field @xmath112 @xcite ( @xmath113 @xcite ) .",
    "typically atom - pump detuning is @xmath114 .",
    "the rate @xmath41 at which atoms are coupled out of the bec is about @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy and potential energy contribution @xmath116 is about @xmath117 @xcite(@xmath118 @xcite).the energy of the cavity mode decreases due to the photon loss through the cavity mirrors , which leads to a reduced atom - field coupling .",
    "photon loss can be minimized by using high - q cavities .",
    "our proposed detection scheme relies crucially on the fact that coherent dynamics dominate over the losses .",
    "it is important that the characteristic time - scales of coherent dynamics are significantly faster than those associated with losses .",
    "in summary we have analyzed a novel scheme of cavity - opto - mechanics with ultracold atoms .",
    "we showed that due to the optical force experienced by the bec in the cavity , the damping rate and the frequency of the bogoliubov mode of the condensate changes . in the presence of atom - atom interactions , the cavity field fluctuations and the condensate fluctuations ( bogoliubov mode )",
    "leads to the splitting of the normal mode into two modes ( normal mode splitting ) .",
    "the system described here shows a complex interplay between distinctly two systems namely , optical micro - cavity and the gas of ultracold atoms . we found that using a bec with high mechanical quality factor squeezing of the intensity of the output light field is obtained at low frequency .",
    "this scheme may lead to a possible realization of a quantum device to tailor quantum fluctuations of output light using cavity quantum electrodynamics and bec technology .",
