    "the shape of the potential , which contains valleys and mountains , is experimentally controlled through the bias current @xmath14 and the bias flux @xmath15 threading the superconducting loop . here",
    ", the inductance coupling parameter @xmath16 is of order unity . with the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 used in our experiments ,",
    "the potential surface displays only one type of local minimum .",
    "they are separated from each other by a saddle point , where the particle can escape @xcite . a contour plot of the potential surface for a typical bias point is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . along the escape direction , which makes an angle @xmath17 with the @xmath18 axis ,",
    "the potential is cubic and is completely characterized by its bottom frequency @xmath19 and a barrier height @xmath20 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ] .",
    "these two quantities depend on the magnetic flux and vanish at the squid s critical current @xmath21 .",
    "we assume complete separation of the variables along the escape direction and the transverse one by neglecting the coupling terms between these two directions . in this approximation ,",
    "the phase dynamics of the squid along the escape direction is similar to the phase dynamics of a current - biased single josephson junction .",

    "several low - lying quantum states are found near the local minimum .",
    "these states , describing the oscillatory motion within the anharmonic potential , are denoted @xmath31 for the @xmath32th level , with @xmath33 the corresponding energies @xmath34 were calculated in ref .",
    "the bohr frequency associated with the transition @xmath35 is denoted @xmath36 in the following .",

    ", the thermal process can be neglected @xcite . on the timescale of the experiment , only the three highest energy levels ,",
    "closest to the top of the barrier , undergo a significant tunnelling effect .",
    "lower energy levels are stable .    our procedure to perform quantum experiments consists of the repetition of an elementary sequence , which is decomposed into four successive steps .",
    "a bias current @xmath14 is first switched on through the squid at fixed magnetic flux @xmath15 .",
    "the working point @xmath38 defines the geometry of the potential well .",
    "the @xmath14 risetime is slow enough to induce adiabatic transformation of the potential and the circuit is initially in the ground state @xmath39 .",
    "a microwave flux pulse characterized by its frequency @xmath40 and amplitude @xmath41 manipulates the quantum state of the system .",
    "it induces a time - dependent perturbation term @xmath42 in the hamiltonian which couples neighbouring levels . in this expression",

    "this flux pulse adiabatically reduces the barrier height and allows tunnelling escape of the localised states to finite voltage states during a time @xmath48 of the order of a few nanoseconds . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with precise adjustment of @xmath46 it is theoretically possible to induce a selective escape of excited states . because the squid is hysteretic , the zero and finite voltage states are stable and the result of the measurement can be readout by monitoring the voltage @xmath49 across the dc squid . escape out of the well corresponds to the detection of a voltage which is twice the superconducting gap of the circuit material .",
    "the current bias @xmath14 must be switched off to reset the circuit in the ground state .",

    "in the two level limit , the detection contrast between states @xmath62 and @xmath63 is @xmath64 . the measuring amplitude which optimizes the detection probability allows a detection contrast of @xmath65 and corresponds to @xmath66 . with these settings , in the general case where more than two levels are populated in the system ,",
    "the escape probability is practically equal to the population of excited states : @xmath67 moreover , it is possible to find a lower pulse amplitude for which the ground and first excited states remain trapped , but states @xmath68 and @xmath69 escape with close to 100% probability . repeating this procedure with successively smaller pulse amplitudes",
    ", one can measure @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 and therefore reconstruct all levels occupancies .",
    "our measurement is one of the fastest implemented in josephson quantum circuits .",
    "the rise time of the measuring pulse is @xmath73 and the duration @xmath48 can be as short as @xmath74 .",
    "this speed allows a time domain study of fast relaxing phenomena and tends to limit the loss of measurement contrast due to relaxation .",
    "the question of the possibility of nonadiabatic effects , namely transitions between energy levels which modify the levels occupancies , has been recently addressed for a rf squid which is a very similar device @xcite .",
    "calculations show that the adiabatic error is negligible for the pulses used in our experiments : it is less than @xmath75 for @xmath76 and decreases very rapidly for slower pulses .    in terms of speed ,",
    "escape to the running state of a tilted washboard potential may also have an advantage over the method used for the rf squid @xcite . in that case , the fictitious particle escapes to another trapped state , which can interact strongly with the qubit levels if relaxation is insufficient .",
    "this leads to retraping of the particle in the qubit states .",
    "this has been investigated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming an infinite @xmath77 , the retrapping probability was found to be greater that @xmath78 . in our case , the qubit excited state escapes to an unbound state of the tilted washboard .",
    "retrapping is therefore much less likely , and faster measurement times possible .",

    "second , spectroscopic measurements of the @xmath86 transition frequency @xmath45 as a function of @xmath14 are used to determine a precise value for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "all measurements are performed with the sample at a temperature of @xmath87 in a dilution fridge .",
    "thermal energy is then small compared to the relevant energy scales of the circuit , namely the josephson energy @xmath88 and the vibration quantum @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the boltzmann constant .    to avoid spurious microwave resonances ,",
    "the chip is mounted in a shielded copper cavity whose cut - off frequency is above 20 ghz .",
    "the immediate electromagnetic environment of the squid , located in the microwave cavity , is designed to decouple the circuit from the external room temperature classical electrical apparatus .",

    "we keep for @xmath63 the relaxation rate @xmath180 . as @xmath32 increases , the relaxation rate of level @xmath31 dramatically increases .",
    "the relaxation rate associated with the random transition @xmath31 to @xmath201 is proportional to @xmath202 .",
    "if we neglect other relaxation channels , such as @xmath203 , with a relaxation rate proportional to the anharmonicity coefficient @xmath28 , the relaxation rate of the @xmath32th level is @xmath204 .",
    "thus , populations evolve in time according to the closed set of master equations : @xmath205 which is easily solved analytically .",
    "the populations @xmath188 are obtained starting from the initial populations @xmath187 after @xmath100w excitation and letting relaxation act during the ramping time @xmath206 .",
    "the result , plotted as solid bars in fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) is in relatively good agreement with experimental values .",
    "however , our model still overestimates @xmath207 .",
    "this may be due to the neglected @xmath208 relaxation channel or to decoherence .",
    "nevertheless , the essential of the physics is captured by this simple model .",
    "[ fig7](a ) presents the measured escape probability after a rabi @xmath192 pulse with increasing microwave amplitudes . in this experiment ,",
    "the measurement pulse amplitude has been set to maximize the detection contrast between @xmath147 and @xmath63 .",
    "our phenomenological model can be used to calculate the global detection efficiencies of each level and to predict the final escape probability given an arbitrary initial population distribution @xmath187 _ before _ the measurement pulse : @xmath209 without any free parameter , this expression describes very well the measured escape probability obtained with high @xmath210w amplitude .",
    "relaxation explains why @xmath53 does not saturate to exactly 1 when 3 or 4 levels are populated after the end of the rabi @xmath192 pulse .",
    "we also remark that , though levels @xmath162 and @xmath69 undergo fast relaxation during the flux ramping , their detection probability is not so different from the pure tunnelling prediction given in the first part of the article . in fact , to give a crude picture , the populations relax towards @xmath63 where they accumulate and can be detected .",
    "the discrepancy which appears for small @xmath43 is due to decoherence : low amplitude @xmath100w implies a slow rabi pulse and bigger errors due to incoherent processes . in a two level system ,",
    "decoherence during a @xmath192 pulse leads to a population reduction @xmath211 $ ] for the first excited state .",
    "we use this result to roughly estimate the complex effect of decoherence in the multilevel regime .",
    "the previous formula leads to the error bars on the predicted escape probability , plotted in fig . [",
    "fig7](a ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated a very fast method for detecting the state of a current biased dc squid .",
    "this technique exploits an adiabatic but ultrafast reduction of the barrier height seen by the trapped levels , which allows a selective escape of the excited states .",
    "practically , the measurement is performed with a roughly trapezoidal flux pulse whose plateau duration is a few nanoseconds .",
    "the detection probability of the ground state is well understood using the standard macroscopic quantum tunnelling formula .",
    "we report a slight broadening of the escape curve due to current noise generated by the close electrical environment of the squid .",
    "this broadening is by far insufficient to account for the observed experimental contrast of detection in the two level limit .",
    "a detailed study of depolarization processes reveals that spurious relaxation during the flux ramping dominates depolarization .",
    "the simple model that we have developed explains the observed contrast of multilevel rabi oscillations , when the measuring pulse amplitude is set to maximise the detection contrast between @xmath147 and @xmath63 .",
    "measurement then gives the population of excited states with a good fidelity .",
    "detection contrast between @xmath31 and @xmath212 with @xmath213 , however , is strongly lowered by relaxation .",
    "depolarization during the flux ramping thus appears as a clear limitation to the experimental determination of the levels occupancies in the multilevel regime . in phase josephson circuits ,",
    "this relaxation is attributed to spurious two level fluctuators , localized inside the dielectric of the josephson junctions .",
    "the remarkable results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite allows for optimism . a new design of the dc squid , combined with a new dielectric for the junction should lead to a significant improvement of the detection contrast .",
    "we thank w. guichard , f. w. j. hekking , l. p. lvy , and a. zazunov for fruitfull discussions .",
    "this work was supported by two aci programs , by the eurosqup project and by the institut de physique de la matire condense .",
    "this analytical calculation is strongly inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , in the general case where the inductance asymmetry coefficient @xmath85 is finite .",
    "let us consider the two dimensional potential : @xmath214,\\ ] ] where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are the reduced bias parameters .",
    "for the bias points used in the article , the potential surface displays equivalent local minima separated by saddle points . the critical current of the squid is geometrically defined as the bias current @xmath30 where the minimum vanishes and merges with adjacent saddle point at the coordinate ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "experiments are performed close to the critical current , therefore a taylor expansion of the potential in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath218 is justified .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce @xmath219 et @xmath220 . limiting calculation to the third order",
    "one obtains : @xmath221 we are interested in the dynamics along the escape direction which corresponds to the direction of minimum curvature at the critical point .",
    "it makes an angle @xmath17 with the @xmath18 axis : @xmath222 let @xmath223 be the phase along the escape direction . looking for extrema of the potential along this direction , one finds a minimum located at @xmath224 and a saddle point . along the escape direction ,",
    "the anharmonic potential reads : @xmath225.\\ ] ] it is fully determined by the plasma frequency @xmath226 and the barrier height @xmath20 : @xmath227 the prefactor @xmath228 is the third derivative of the potential along the escape direction . @xmath229 and @xmath230 are the well known barrier height and plasma frequency for a single josephson junction with critical current @xmath30 , capacitance @xmath231 , biased with a current @xmath14 : @xmath232",
    "in the general case , a small flux perturbation @xmath233 added to the bias flux introduces a perturbation term : @xmath234 the component of this operator on the escape direction reads : @xmath235 assuming a monochromatic perturbation @xmath236 , one obtains the perturbation term : @xmath237 where @xmath43 is the 2-level rabi frequency for a tuned excitation ( @xmath238 ) : @xmath239      d. vion d , a. aassime , a. cottet , p. joyez , h. pothier , c. urbina , d. esteve , and m. h. devoret , science * 296 * , 886 ( 2002 ) ; e. collin , g. ithier , a. aassime , p. joyez , d. vion , and d. esteve , phys .",
