    "the study of simple lattice models has emerged as an effective way to understand nonequilibrium steady states and phase transitions  @xcite . in particular , the simple exclusion process  @xcite and the zero range process  @xcite , owing to their simplicity and richness , have emerged as paradigms for nonequilibrium systems .",
    "when such processes are considered with periodic boundary conditions , a phase transition can occur either due to dynamical features such as particle jump rates  @xcite , chipping and aggregation  @xcite , or due to the presence of disorder on the lattice  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of open boundaries , where particles can be inserted and removed , is significant enough to lead to boundary - induced phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram is well understood for the basic version of the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries . besides its analytic solutions  @xcite , the underlying physical mechanism is also well understood in terms of the group velocity  @xcite as well as the domain wall velocity and collective velocity  @xcite .",
    "recently it was reported that some additional dynamical features such as evaporation and deposition  @xcite or nonlocal hopping  @xcite lead to new kinds of phases and phase transitions .    in this paper , we study the phase transition in a generalized version of the one - dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) with open boundaries where the additional feature of nonlocal hopping is included . by increasing the nonlocal hopping rate ( or equivalently decreasing the input rate of particles at the boundaries ) , the system undergoes a first order phase transition from a finite density ( fd ) phase into an empty road ( er ) phase with zero density via a clustered state at the transition .",
    "this is quite different from the dynamic instability transitions found in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) with nonlocal hopping studied previously  @xcite . in the tasep variant ,",
    "the particle clusters are stable and moving with a drift velocity depending on the nonlocal hopping rate in the most part of the fd phase . in our case ,",
    "the clusters are stationary on average and stable only at the transition .",
    "they expand until they fill up the whole system in the fd phase and shrink away in the er phase where the whole system is empty except for finite - size clusters clinging to the boundaries . at the transition",
    ", the particle clusters are distributed over the system with a power - law gap ( intercluster distance ) distribution .",
    "the periodic - boundary ( pb ) version of our model was already investigated  @xcite in terms of a mass transport process .",
    "there are similarities and also differences , compared to the open - boundary case . in the pb setup ,",
    "the number of particles is conserved and plays the role of the external parameter .",
    "as the particle density decreases , one finds a continuous condensation ( phase separation ) transition from a homogeneous density state to a state with an infinite stretch of empty sites ( macroscopic mass at a site in the language of the mass transport model ) .",
    "the homogeneous density state is basically the same as the fd state in our open - boundary setup except near the boundaries .",
    "the same applies to the critical state .",
    "however , the condensed state includes the background particle clusters with the critical gap distribution over a finite fraction of the system besides the macroscopic gap , while the exponential gap distribution only near the boundaries ( vanishing fraction of the system ) is found in the er phase .    based on the cluster dynamics analysis",
    ", we show that the particle density controls the stability of a cluster .",
    "clusters are stable only at a specific density against nonlocal hopping events , which determines the transition point .",
    "high - density clusters expand mainly by local hopping events , while low - density clusters shrink easily by nonlocal hopping events .",
    "we claim that two seemingly different transitions in both boundary setups are caused by the same mechanism based on the cluster stability .",
    "we will also argue that the difference in the nature of the condensed and er phase is simply due to the presence of possible exits for particles through the open boundaries .",
    "the conventional ssep has been well studied with both periodic and open boundary conditions  @xcite . with periodic or symmetric open boundary setups ,",
    "the ssep is an equilibrium system with no phase transitions .",
    "although our dynamical rule in the bulk and at the boundaries does not break the left - right symmetry present in the ssep , the extra feature of nonlocal hopping drives the system out of equilibrium and leads to a significant change in the steady - state nature for both boundary setups . as a result ,",
    "contrary to the conventional ssep with open boundaries , our modified version exhibits an abrupt nonequilibrium transition on varying the input rates at boundaries and the nonlocal hopping rate .",

    "[ phase diagram ] , we describe our model and present the numerical results for the phase diagram , clustering , gap distributions , density profile , and finite - size properties . in sec .",

    "the phase transition from the fd phase into the er phase turns out to be always discontinuous with a jump of @xmath23 at the transition @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ jump ] ) .",
    "this implies that this instability transition is caused by competition of the bulk density against the nonlocal hopping rate .",
    "the boundary parameters such as the input rate @xmath20 only play an implicit role in this transition via determining the bulk density .",
    "this suggests that our open - boundary version should be very similar , if not identical , to the periodic - boundary version which is controlled directly by the bulk density and the nonlocal hopping rate .",

    "the numerical values of the exponents @xmath65 are very close to the mean - field predictions of @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "the main difference lies in the er phase where an exponential decay is observed with a @xmath55-function while , in the pb setup , the @xmath55-function is accompanied by a power law with the same exponent @xmath67 as at criticality in the condensed phase .",

    "[ timeplot ] , there is a formation of clusters at @xmath0 and the power - law gap distribution is an indicator of such clusters . in the er phase ,",
    "all clusters dissolve away except two mother clusters near the boundaries .",
    "we believe that the reason for this phase transition lies in the instability of clusters",
    ". moreover , the clusters could be highly sensitive to the open boundaries with which the system would be unable to sustain the clusters inside .",
    "we will discuss this point via a cluster stability analysis in the next section .",
    "we finally discuss the asymptotic behavior of the density profile @xmath73 as well as the finite - size property of the road density @xmath17 .",
    "based on numerical data , we propose @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the bulk density in the infinite - size limit .",
    "figure  [ profile ] shows that the density profile has a power - law tail near the boundary with @xmath76 in the fd phase ; @xmath77 at the transition approaching from the fd side ; and the exponential tail in the er phase .",
    "this is quite different from that in the ordinary open ssep where @xmath78 does not have any tail structure and it is uniform when there is the left - right symmetry  @xcite .",
    "one can calculate the finite - size property of the road density by integrating the density profile up to size @xmath2 : @xmath79 in the er phase , the total number of particles , @xmath80 , becomes a @xmath21-dependent constant @xmath81 in the infinite - size limit . approaching the transition point from the er side , we expect this constant to diverge .",
    "figure  [ nr - zeta ] suggests the power - law type divergence as @xmath50 with @xmath82 .",
    "one may relate the exponent @xmath83 to the finite - size - scaling exponent @xmath84 which is termed the crossover exponent in the pb version .",
    "the cutoff gap size @xmath85 should scale as @xmath86 close to the transition [ see eq .",
    "( 20 ) in @xcite ] and also as @xmath87 with @xmath68 .",
    "therefore we expect @xmath88 , leading to @xmath89 , which is again consistent with the mean - field result for the pb version  @xcite .",
    "in the tasep variant studied previously  @xcite , the cluster dynamics analysis provides a key insight to understanding the instability transition and also leads to quite accurate predictions .",
    "here we take a similar approach and focus on the stability of clusters . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ timeplot ] at the transition , there are many floating clusters ( free clusters ) in the bulk besides two clusters attached to the reservoirs ( mother clusters ) .",
    "assume that the steady state at the transition consists of these clusters .",
    "first , consider the free clusters with the average bulk density @xmath90 and the side density @xmath91 ( the side densities at the right and left side of the clusters are expected to be identical for free clusters ) .",
    "the right front of such a cluster moves with a velocity given by @xmath92 the first ( second ) term on the right - hand side ( rhs ) arises from a local ( nonlocal ) move of the particle at the front to the right .",
    "the cluster front creeps forward by its local move to the right , but shrinks back due to the detachment of the front particle by a nonlocal hopping to the next cluster in front .",
    "the third term arises from its move to the left , which is possible only when the target site is vacant ( nonlocal hops are ignored inside the clusters ) .",
    "the last term is due to the nonlocal hop of a particle from the next cluster in front , which makes the cluster front advances by one unit .",
    "one can write a similar equation for the left front velocity of the cluster .",
    "since there is the left - right symmetry in the dynamics , our clusters do not drift in either direction ( @xmath93 ) and the clusters are stable only when @xmath94 .",
    "this leads to the conditions : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the critical side density for the stable clusters .",
    "note that , for given @xmath21 , the clusters are stable only when their side density is precisely equal to the critical density and they are extremely sensitive to a slight change of their side density .",
    "if the side density increases temporarily by fluctuations , the front velocity becomes positive and the clusters start to expand and merge into each other until they fill up the road , if the reservoirs supply particles sufficiently into the free clusters through the mother clusters . in the opposite case , the clusters start to shrink and vanish , leading to the appearance of a big empty stretch on the road , if the mother clusters do not completely block the escape of particles to the reservoirs .",
    "now , consider the mother clusters .",
    "the right front of the mother cluster attached to the left reservoir is free to expand or contract .",
    "similar to the free cluster analysis , we find the front velocity as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the front density of the mother cluster .",
    "for the mother cluster to be stable , this velocity should be zero , which leads to the condition : @xmath99 similar to the free clusters , the stability of the mother clusters is extremely fragile to density fluctuations and their critical front density is exactly the same as that of the free clusters .    since the mother cluster is in a sense a buffer between the boundary and the bulk",
    ", it has a continuously varying density with a higher value at the boundary and a lower value into the bulk .",
    "if this bulk density is higher than the critical density @xmath100 , the mother cluster expands and merges with bulk free clusters until they fill up the whole road uniformly . in the opposite situation ,",
    "it shrinks and retreats close to the boundary until the front density becomes equal to the critical density",
    ". this short mother cluster should be very unstable and fluctuate wildly .",
    "in this case , the bulk free clusters may escape away from the system via nonlocal hopping whenever the mother clusters vanish intermittently .",
    "therefore we expect , in the steady state , only two short mother clusters with a big macroscopic empty road in the bulk . when the bulk density is precisely equal to the critical density , the mother cluster is stable .",
    "also , due to the left - right symmetry in dynamics , the side density of the free clusters is expected to be the same as the front density of the mother cluster : @xmath101 .",
    "therefore the free clusters are also stable in this case and we expect a cluster fluid .",
    "next , we calculate the density profile of the mother cluster to determine the bulk density as function of the external parameters @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "the stability conditions of clusters provide a criterion for the phase transition in terms of the front or side density of clusters and the nonlocal hopping parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we would now like to bring the input rate @xmath20 into the picture , which will determine the particle density profile of the mother cluster . in the fd phase ( small @xmath21 )",
    ", the steady state has no clustering with finite bulk density . in this regime",
    ", we may use a simple mean - field ( mf ) analysis to determine the density profile . approaching the transition ,",
    "the system becomes correlated and the mf results may not be trustworthy .",
    "however , the correlation is finite at the discontinuous transition , so the deviation from the mf results is expected to be small .",
    "the density of the mother cluster decreases from a higher value near the reservoir and settles to a constant value in the bulk .",
    "this bulk value @xmath102 is what we are interested in : at the transition , this value is equal to the critical density ; @xmath103 .    to determine the mf density profile ,",
    "let us consider the current at the bulk bond between sites @xmath8 and @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the average current flowing to the right is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the occupancy of site @xmath8 and the vacancy @xmath108 .",
    "the first term on the rhs accounts for the local jump from @xmath8 to @xmath104 and the second term for the nonlocal hop of a particle on a site to the left of @xmath8 .",
    "the third term accounts for the case in which there is no such particle at all to the left of @xmath8 , which would not allow any nonlocal hop : @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 one can similarly write the expression for the left current @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "the symmetry in the problem dictates that , in the steady state , the average current through a site should be zero as @xmath113    for @xmath114 , we may take @xmath115 in the fd phase . combining this with eq .",
    "( [ lrcurrent ] ) , we arrive at @xmath116 employing the mf approximation such as @xmath117 , one can write the recurrence relations for the vacancy profile in the bulk @xmath118    now consider the current at the boundary between the left reservoir ( @xmath5 ) and the site @xmath119",
    ". one may easily find @xmath120 again , the total average current is zero and @xmath121 for the fd phase and also at the transition .",
    "thus , we get @xmath122 using eqs .",
    "( [ mfone ] ) and  ( [ mftwo ] ) , we determine the density profile iteratively .",
    "the density decreases from a high value near the reservoir and saturates to a bulk value @xmath123 . using the stability condition @xmath124 ,",
    "the phase boundary @xmath125 is evaluated , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] . for small @xmath21",
    ", the mf prediction agrees very well with the monte carlo data . as @xmath21 increases , the nonlocal events that induce a strong density - density correlations become important .",
    "thus , the results of our mf analysis show some deviation from the monte carlo results .      our cluster stability analysis may be directly applied to the periodic - boundary ( pb ) version",
    "of course , the stability condition derived here is not exact due to ignoring nonlocal intracluster hops .",
    "moreover the side or front density can not be equivalent to the given bulk density @xmath17 in the pb version .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the exact transition line equation @xmath24  @xcite coincides with our stability equation .",
    "the picture developed in the cluster stability analysis explains the sudden jump in the density leading to a discontinuous transition , in terms of the formation and dissolution of clusters .",
    "let us compare our case to the pb version , where the phase transition is continuous .",
    "the system studied in  @xcite is based on the mass transport process , so it has no restriction on the occupancy of sites and the dynamical rules consist of particle clusters diffusing and merging on contact .",
    "in addition , single particles can chip off from clusters and move to the neighboring sites .",
    "the boundary conditions are taken to be periodic .",
    "this model can be mapped exactly onto the ssep with nonlocal hopping in the pb setup .    in the ssep language",
    ", it shows a continuous phase transition from the uniform fd phase into the condensed phase with a macroscopic gap . in the condensed phase ( corresponding to the er phase in our model ) , the gap distribution is still critical ( the same as at the transition ) with a trivial macroscopic gap .",
    "this may also be understood with our picture of the free cluster stability .",
    "note that there are only free clusters at the transition in the pb setup .",
    "going into the condensed phase by lowering the total density , the clusters are diluted and thus become unstable by emitting particles away .",
    "however , in contrast to our model with open boundaries , particles can not escape the system in the pb version .",
    "instability and fluctuations may drive particles into a finite ( but macroscopic ) segment of the system where the local density is equal to the critical bulk density .",
    "then this finite segment can maintain its stability by shooting particles via nonlocal hopping through a macroscopic empty road . as the particle density in this segment is critical",
    ", the gap distribution should be exactly the same as that at the transition with only one extra macroscopic gap . in our open boundary setup ,",
    "the mother clusters become highly unstable and the free clusters escape away through the boundaries .",
    "thus , the resulting gap distribution become exponential .",
    "the periodic and open boundary conditions discussed here define different ensembles such as canonical and grand - canonical ensembles where the number of particles is conserved or controlled by such external parameters as the input rate . in the equilibrium systems , it is well known that two ensembles are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . in nonequilibrium systems , this ensemble equivalence does not need to hold in general .",
    "our study provides a simple example in which the open boundary is crucial to the nature of the instability transition .",
    "in this paper , we studied how the nonequilibrium system is affected by different boundary conditions . in the case of the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) with nonlocal hopping in one spatial dimension",
    ", we showed that the presence of open boundaries induces a boundary - induced abrupt transition .",
    "we developed the cluster stability analysis to explain this abrupt transition successfully , which was compared and contrasted to the system without boundaries ( closed chain ) .",
    "we found that the cluster stability governs the underlying physical mechanism of instability - induced phase transitions , and we discussed the ensemble equivalence in the generalized ssep .",
    "it is also interesting to test the ensemble equivalence in the generalized asymmetric exclusion process with the same type of nonlocal hopping events studied in  @xcite , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
