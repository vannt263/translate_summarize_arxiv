    "main sequence stars are expected to be fully convective if their mass lies below a certain value , about 0.30.4  @xmath1 ( m3@xmath2m4 spectral types ) , as suggested by standard models ; this probably shifts toward lower masses ( 0.10.2  @xmath1 ) due to the influence of the magnetic field @xcite . in fully convective stars ,",
    "a turbulent dynamo that differs from the shell dynamo at work in partly convective sun - like stars has been proposed to take place @xcite . however , some recent observations @xcite have not supported such theoretical models .",
    "on one side , the model of chabrier & kker ( 2006 ) predicts : ( 1 ) weak surface differential rotation , in agreement with the observations of donati et al . ;",
    "( 2 ) non - axisymmetric large scale fields , in contradiction with these observations . on the other side , the model of dobler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) concludes : ( 1 ) large scale axisymmetric fields , in agreement with the observations ; ( 2 ) significant surface differential rotation , in contradiction with the observations .",
    "therefore understanding how the magnetic field is generated in the fully convective stars and what the field properties are is clearly important .",
    "the atmospheres of such ultracool , very low mass stars are predominantly cool , dense , and highly neutral , apparently precluding the build - up of magnetic stresses thought to provide magnetic heating .",
    "yet , detections of observational signatures commonly associated with magnetic activity in sun - like and fully convective stars @xcite suggest that the production mechanism is the same or nearly the same in very low mass stars as for low mass and sun - like stars",
    ". further study of the x - ray emissions @xcite and @xmath3 emissions @xcite is one way to delimit the properties of magnetic heating in very low mass stars and indirectly investigate the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "recent detections and studies of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs @xcite also offer us another important approach to understand the properties of magnetic fields in the fully convective stars , as the magnetic field is likely intimately involved in the production mechanism of the radio radiation from these objects .    in this paper , we present our radio observation of a sample of 8 ultracool dwarfs and the detection of the m8 binary lp  349 - 25 using the very large array . in ",
    "2 we present the observation and the data reduction , the properties of the radio emission from lp  349 - 25 are given in   3 ,",
    "we discuss radio emission from lp  349 - 25 particularly and its radio mechanism in   4 .",
    "we selected a sample of nearby ultracool field dwarfs with spectral types ranging over a narrow band of m8l0 since 5 of 9 ultracool dwarfs detected at radio wavelengths are m8m9.5 dwarfs , giving a significant fraction of @xmath456% ( see table  1 in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the rotational velocities of the stars range from 4 to 35  km  s@xmath5 , and the @xmath3 equivalent width ranges from 0 to 21   .",
    "some known binary systems are also added , including the new tight m8 binary lp  349 - 25 whose binary status was recently reported by @xcite .    in this paper , we present our radio observation results of 8 of these dwarfs .",
    "their properties are listed in table  [ sample ] .",
    "we observed the 8 dwarfs from 2005 december 22 to 2006 january 02 with the nrao very large array ( vla ) when the array was the d configuration , except the observation of 2 m  0140@xmath627 in dnc , at 8.5  ghz ( 3.6  cm ) using the standard continuum mode with 2  @xmath7  50  mhz contiguous bands .",
    "the flux density calibrators were 3c  48 , 3c  147 , and 3c  286 and the phase calibrators were selected to be within @xmath8 of the targets .",
    "the data was reduced and analyzed with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . only lp  349 - 25 was detected at the observed frequency of 8.5  ghz ( fig .",
    "[ vlaimage ] ) . in order to examine the emission from this object",
    ", we subtracted the visibilities of other radio sources in the field , and re - imaged the visibility dataset .",
    "we extracted the position and flux of the source in total intensity , and made an image of the dataset in circular polarization ( stokes v ) .",
    "in addition , we investigated the time variation of the source using the task dftpl within aips",
    ".      table  [ sample ] gives the flux and upper limits for the detections / non - detections , respectively .",
    "the position of the radio source near the center in the map of the field around lp  349 - 25 coincides with the expected position of lp  349 - 25 at the epoch of our observations ( 2005.967 ) with its proper motion included ( @xmath9ra@xmath10  arcsec  yr@xmath5 , @xmath9de@xmath11  arcsec  yr@xmath5 , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the detected radio emission is from lp  349 - 25 .",
    "our initial examination of maps made in total intensity ( stokes i ) and circular polarization ( stokes v ) show the existence of a weak source in the stokes v map near this same position .",
    "further investigation , however , reveals that the location of the source in the stokes v map is offset with respect to the position of the source in the stokes i map by @xmath12 10 arcseconds .",
    "the right ( rcp ) and left ( lcp ) circularly polarized primary beams of the vla are separated by about 6% of the half - width at half maximum of the antenna beam .",
    "this gives rise to a phenomenon known as `` beamsquint '' @xcite , and for observations at 8.5 ghz the magnitude of the offset is 10.3 arcsec .",
    "this makes the detection of circular polarization intrinsic to the source suspect .",
    "finally , re - imaging of this field in stokes v after subtracting the visibilities in total intensity produces a lower significance ( @xmath133@xmath14 ) of the source .",
    "based on the fluctuations in the stokes v image , we deduce a 3@xmath14 upper limit of 48 @xmath9jy , or a circular polarization percentage @xmath1313% .",
    "the total extent of the observations of lp  349 - 25 was only @xmath41.7 hours , precluding the possibility of searching for rotational modulations , as this would correspond to one rotation period only for very rapidly rotating objects ( e.g. tvlm  513 - 46546 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we extracted light curves of total intensity from the visibility dataset using time bins of 300 and 60 seconds to search for short - time scale transient brightenings .",
    "no obvious evidence of flare variability presented itself on visual inspection of either light curve . using the one - sided kolmogorov - smirnov statistic",
    ", we tried to see if we could reject the null hypothesis that the fluxes are distributed uniformly in time and thereby establish evidence for variability .",
    "we compared the cumulative distribution function of the fluxes to that of a uniform distribution in time , and conclude that the data are consistent with being drawn from a uniform distribution of events with ks statistics of 0.05 and 0.01 for the 300 and 60 second time binnings , respectively .",
    "the ks probabilites are unity in both cases , thus we find no evidence for variability .",
    "the flux detected from lp  349 - 25 together with the parallax measurement of 67.6  mas @xcite imply a radio luminosity of 9.6@xmath710@xmath15  erg  s@xmath5  hz@xmath5 .",
    "this is @xmath12  3 times larger than the steady luminosities of previously detected single very low mass dwarfs with similar spectral types ( m8m9 ) .",
    "the makeup of the binary system in lp  349 - 25 is likely m7.5v+m8.5v or m8v+m9v ( according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus if the two components are equal contributors to the radio flux the radio luminosity of each dwarf would be comparable to or slightly brighter than the steady flux levels of the brightest apparently single dwarf previously detected .",
    "the projected separation of the binary is 0.12  or 1.78  au at the distance of 14.8  pc , derived from its trigonometric parallax measured recently @xcite .",
    "the beam size of the image from our d array observations is 9.2@xmath78.0(major axis @xmath7 minor axis ) , with a position angle of 76@xmath16 , thus we can not spatially resolve the two components .    with",
    "only one observed frequency of 8.5  ghz , we can not constrain an emission mechanism .",
    "previous papers have discussed two mechanisms : gyrosynchrotron emission from a population of mildly relativistic accelerated particles @xcite , and cyclotron maser emission @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature of the emission is fundamental to constraining the emission mechanism , but with two dwarfs both being potential sources of the radiation , there are two unknowns in converting flux to brightness temperature : the fraction of the total flux which each component contributes , and the size of the emitting region ( being possibly different for each dwarf ) .",
    "we consider two simplifying cases : ( 1 ) each dwarf contributes half the observed flux , with characteristic length scale the radius of the dwarf ( where the radius is @xmath120.1  r@xmath17 ) as suggested by the previous observations @xcite ; ( 2 ) one dwarf contributes all of the emission , with length scale one tenth the dwarf radius as observed in a few m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "application of the relationship between brightness temperature , frequency , flux density , and source size @xcite , + @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the source flux in @xmath9jy , @xmath20 is the observing frequency in ghz , and @xmath21 is the angular size of the source in mas , yields for the first case @xmath22  k , and in the second case @xmath23  k. the high brightness temperatures indicate that the emission is nonthermal and could be consistent with gyrosynchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "one should note that larger size scales reduce the estimated brightness temperatures . in the second case , with @xmath24",
    "k a coherent mechanism , such as cyclotron maser emission is also applicable .",
    "such a mechanism has been suggested by @xcite to account for the periodic variation of flux density and circular polarization in two other dwarfs .",
    "@xcite noted that the unmodulated flux of their target , tvlm  513 - 46546 , could be attributable to gyrosynchrotron emission with undetected circular polarization .",
    "clearly , more observations of lp  349 - 25 are needed to determine its characteristics better .",
    "our sample of 8 late - m dwarfs with spectral types ranging from m8.0 to m9.5 produced only one detection , that of a binary consistent with two m8 dwarfs . including the objects in our survey with previous reports on late m - t dwarfs @xcite , the fraction of late - m and brown dwarfs detected at radio wavelengths is @xmath410% so far ( see table  1 in @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , over a narrower range of spectral type , @xmath4m8@xmath25m9.5 a larger fraction , 18% , of objects have been detected at radio wavelengths , including our sample .",
    "@xcite suggested that rotation may play a role in influencing which objects are detected at radio wavelengths , by noting that the few objects with radio detections were among those with the largest values of @xmath26 .",
    "the relationship between rotation and the existence of large - scale magnetic fields , which may be necessary to influence the production of radio emision , has been suggested for fully convective stars by @xcite , based on measurements of longitudinal magnetic field strengths in the active dm3.5e star ev  lac ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath5 ) and absence in the slower rotator dm5.5 hh  and ( @xmath28  km  s@xmath5 ) . the fact that none of the fast rotators in our sample ( @xmath29  km  s@xmath5 ) provided radio detections suggests that @xmath26 is not the dominant factor controlling the production of detectable levels of radio emission .",
    "only the binary lp  349 - 25 was detected but unfortunately the rotational velocities of its components have not been measured so far .",
    "thus , the correlation between radio emission and rotation is still unclear .    the ambiguous relationship between rotation and radio emission",
    "is strengthened upon considering the field m stars vb  8 and lhs  3003 ( both spectral type m8 ) , which have similar rotational velocities ( 8  km  s@xmath5 for vb  8 and 9  km  s@xmath5 for lhs  3003 ) , and are located at @xmath30  6.5  pc . despite the similarities in spectral type , @xmath26 , and distance ( which produces similar sensivities ) ,",
    "only lhs  3003 has shown radio quiescent emission @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is that they were observed at different radio frequencies : @xcite observed vb  8 at 8.5  ghz and @xcite observed lhs  3003 at frequencies of 4.8 and 8.6  ghz but they only detected the star at 4.8  ghz .",
    "this might suggest that the spectral peak of radio emission from ultracool and brown dwarfs is closer to 4.8  ghz rather than 8.5  ghz , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation lies in the bias that inclination can introduce in estimating rotation rates from @xmath26 .",
    "photometric periods combined with spectroscopic rotation velocities have the potential to nail down this discrepancy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is no explicit dependence between either emission mechanism proposed so far for radio emission from very low mass dwarfs and rotation . for two cases where",
    "radio emission has been detected and rotational modulation of the emission has been determined , @xcite proposed a model whereby a large scale dipole or multipole with magnetic field strength of a few kg at the stellar surface can produce cyclotron maser emission in regions where the strong - field condition @xmath31 1 is satisfied , where @xmath32 is the plasma frequency ( @xmath33  hz ) and @xmath34 is the gyro - frequency ( @xmath35(g )  hz ) ; i.e. in regions of low electron density and high magnetic field strength .",
    "the recent detection of a strong and large - scale axisymmetric magnetic field on a rapidly rotating m4 dwarf ( v374  peg , @xmath36  km  s@xmath5 ) bolsters the suggestion of a link between large - scale fields , rapid rotation , and detectable levels of varying radio emission , but provides only a post hoc explanation for why some objects are detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "clearly , a detailed investigation of those objects which do show evidence of radio emission is needed , along with suitable samples of objects with similar properties but lacking in radio detections , to tease out any controlling parameters .",
    "so far , there are no clear correlations between radio emission from ultracool and brown dwarfs and their properties such as rotation , spectral types , and chromospheric activity ; and radio emission mechanisms are possibly gyrosynchrotron or coherent electron cyclotron maser emission .",
    "we present our radio observations of a sample of 8 late - m dwarfs , with spectral types ranging over a narrow band of m8.0@xmath2m9.5",
    ". only one of them has been detected , the m8 binary lp  349 - 35 . we have observed lp  349 - 25 at only 8.5  ghz , thus incoherent gyrosynchrotron or coherent electron cyclotron maser emission could be applicable .",
    "observation of multiple radio frequencies will clarify the radio emission mechanism of the binary , and measurement of @xmath26 of each component will also be required to test whether any correlation with rotation is implied by this radio detection .",
    "the lack of detections of the fast rotators in our sample suggest a murky picture of the relationship between radio emission and rotation ( as measured by @xmath26 ) .",
    "finally , with a separation of only 1.8  au , derived from an angular separation of 0.12  and @xmath0  mas @xcite , dynamical masses of each component of lp  349 - 25 are under measurement ( t. forveille , private communication ) .",
    "as the masses of the components of lp  349 - 25 can be measured precisely without any theoretical assumptions , this will therefore allow us to clarify their fully - convective status ( e.g. , 0.10.2  @xmath1 , @xcite ) , and hence the kind of magnetic dynamo in these ultracool dwarf components which may play an important role to explain our detection of radio emission from these objects .",
    "this also makes the system an excellent target for further studies with better constraints on the correlations between x - ray , radio emission and stellar parameters such as mass , age , temperature , and luminosity in ultracool dwarfs .",
