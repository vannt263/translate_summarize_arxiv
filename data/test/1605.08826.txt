    "fault - tolerant quantum computing requires that the fidelities of elementary quantum logic gates exceed certain thresholds  @xcite .",
    "these fidelity thresholds depend on the architecture .",
    "however , even for the most forgiving cases the threshold is high ; therefore , reaching and exceeding it is an extraordinarily difficult task .",
    "the implementation of high - fidelity quantum operations is also relevant , although to a lesser extent , in other quantum technologies , including quantum communication and sensing . qualitatively speaking",
    ", the fidelity of a gate depends on the ratio between the quantum coherence time and the gate time , implying two approaches to increase gate fidelities : increasing coherence times and reducing gate times .    in most qubit architectures ,",
    "single - qubit gates are implemented by applying an oscillating field that is resonant with the qubit transition frequency .",
    "most of the experiments and theoretical studies on such gates were performed with a driving strength that is significantly smaller than the qubit transition frequency . in this weak - driving regime , the qubit undergoes rabi oscillations between the two energy eigenstates at a rate that is proportional to the driving strength .",
    "this situation is described rather accurately using the rotating wave approximation  @xcite ( rwa ) , which predicts sinusoidal oscillations between the energy eigenstates .    with strong",
    "driving , the rwa breaks down and the dynamics becomes very complex . despite the increased complexity in controlling dynamics , the strong driving regime is interesting because it brings the opportunity to implement advanced quantum control  @xcite and achieve faster quantum operations than in the weak driving regime .    a two - level quantum system ( or a qubit ) driven by strong resonant pulses has been studied experimentally using nv centers in diamond  @xcite , semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite and superconducting circuits  @xcite . in a few experiments",
    "@xcite , the qubit population exhibits complex dynamics containing a few frequency components , as the driving strength approaches or exceeds the qubit transition frequency , a signature of the breakdown of the rwa .",
    "therefore , for the proper design of quantum gates in this regime , different theoretical methods are required .",
    "floquet theory  @xcite , which provides a general framework for treating periodically driven quantum systems with any driving strength , is the natural method for analyzing strong - driving dynamics . in ref .",
    ", the quasienergies and quasienergy states ( hereafter referred to as floquet states ) , as predicted by floquet theory , were observed in a strongly driven superconducting qubit .",
    "moreover , the observed dynamics pointed to the important role that the pulse shape plays in the qubit evolution , as determined by adiabaticity conditions in the floquet picture .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a comprehensive theoretical analysis of qubit dynamics under strong resonant pulses using floquet theory .",
    "we derive approximate analytical expressions for the quasienergies and floquet states as functions of the driving amplitude for the practically important case where the qubit is biased at its symmetry point .",
    "we then analyze the qubit dynamics induced by a driving pulse , obtained by modulating the amplitude of a periodic signal .",
    "the quantum state of the qubit is naturally expressed as a superposition of floquet states .",
    "the occupation probabilities of the floquet states remain fixed as long as the driving strength is fixed , but they can change when the pulse envelope varies in time .",
    "we analyze the qubit dynamics using a representation of its state in the floquet picture  @xcite .",
    "when the change in the driving strength is slow , the occupation probabilities of the floquet states remain almost constant , although the floquet states themselves change in accordance with the instantaneous driving strength .",
    "the quantum superposition of the floquet states acquires a phase that depends on the evolution of the quasienergies over time .",
    "this acquired phase corresponds to a qubit state rotation , generalizing the notion of rabi oscillations to the case of large driving amplitudes .",
    "however , a pulse with slowly varying amplitude corresponds to relatively slow quantum gates .",
    "we therefore analyze the dynamics with short pulses , when in general nonadiabatic transitions between floquet states can not be neglected .",
    "we find that with suitable pulse parameters the nonadiabatic transitions can be largely suppressed .",
    "this effect provides the basis of floquet interference efficient suppression of transitions in the adiabatic basis ( fiesta ) , a method to optimize quantum gates with strong driving .",
    "finally , we show that fiesta can be used to implement high - fidelity single - qubit operations in very short times , significantly alleviating the effect of decoherence .",

    "<S> we consider the dynamics of a two - level system ( qubit ) driven by strong and short resonant pulses in the framework of floquet theory . </S>",
    "<S> first we derive analytical expressions for the quasienergies and floquet states of the driven system . </S>",
    "<S> if the pulse amplitude varies very slowly , the system adiabatically follows the instantaneous floquet states , which acquire dynamical phases that depend on the evolution of the quasienergies over time . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the phases acquired by the two floquet states corresponds to a qubit state rotation , generalizing the notion of rabi oscillations to the case of large driving amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> if the pulse amplitude changes very fast , the evolution is non - adiabatic , with transitions taking place between the floquet states . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify and analyze the nonadiabatic transitions during the pulse by employing adiabatic perturbation theory and exact numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for certain combinations of pulse rise and fall times and maximum driving amplitude , a destructive interference effect leads to a remarkably strong suppression of transitions between the floquet states . </S>",
    "<S> this effect provides the basis of a quantum control protocol , which we name floquet interference efficient suppression of transitions in the adiabatic basis ( fiesta ) , that can be used to design ultra - fast high - fidelity single - qubit quantum gates . </S>"
