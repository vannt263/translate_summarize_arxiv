    "the theory of cosmological perturbations is a cornerstone of the study of the early universe , since most of the accessible information from this epoch is believed to be contained in the cosmological fluctuations that are observed in the cmb and , more indirectly , in the large scale structures . as a consequence ,",
    "an important step in the elaboration of an early universe model is to be able to deal with the origin and the early evolution of cosmological perturbations .",
    "a recent picture suggested ( or revived ) to describe our universe is that of a braneworld , i.e.  a submanifold , where ordinary matter is confined , embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime @xcite . in a cosmological context , and for one extra dimension , this picture has led to brane cosmology , which was shown to deviate from standard cosmology at high energy @xcite .    soon after these progresses in homogeneous brane cosmology , several works started to tackle the difficult problem of cosmological perturbations in this context .",
    "one can distinguish three main approaches in these various formalisms .",
    "one approach was to use directly a doubly gauge - invariant formalism to describe the perturbations in the bulk and in the brane @xcite .",
    "another approach was to use a covariant formalism @xcite .",
    "finally , the most common approach has been to generalize the standard metric based formalism @xcite , which has been used in standard cosmology for a long time @xcite . for detailed reviews on braneworld perturbations",
    "see @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the latter approach , which has the advantage to be of more direct access and to be more familiar to people who have already studied the standard theory of cosmological perturbations in four dimensions .",
    "the specific purpose of the present work is to present how one can describe the brane perturbations for _ any gauge _ chosen in the _",
    "bulk_. since this particular point has generated mistakes and confusion in the literature , we believe it is worthwhile to consider this question with some attention .",
    "the core of the problem is that , in the standard theory of cosmological perturbations , the perturbation for any quantity is defined by comparing the perturbed and unperturbed values _ at the same coordinate point_. in brane cosmology , or in fact in any model where one or several submanifolds have some specific physical role , one wishes instead to define perturbations by comparing quantities _ at the same physical locus_.    in the next section we discuss the definition of perturbations on a manifold and study how this definition is affected if a submanifold is present . in section [ metric_sec ]",
    "we apply these notions to a 5d metric tensor as an example in the braneworld scenario . in section",
    "[ curv_sec ] we then turn to the problem of calculating the extrinsic curvature tensor of the brane .",
    "we conclude in the last section .",
    "we consider the following situation : a spacetime @xmath0 corresponding to the perturbation of a reference spacetime @xmath1 and a submanifold @xmath2 in @xmath0 , which can be seen as the perturbation of an unperturbed submanifold @xmath3 in @xmath1 .",
    "we then wish to define meaningful ( linear ) perturbations for tensorial quantities defined on the submanifold .",
    "let us ignore at this stage the submanifold @xmath2 and let us recall some basic principles of the standard theory of linear perturbations in general relativity @xcite .",
    "the starting point is to endow the unperturbed manifold @xmath1 of dimension @xmath4 with a coordinate system which we call @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) , which is usually chosen according to the symmetries of @xmath1 so that the explicit form of the metric is as simple as possible .    the next step is to introduce , in a geometrical language @xcite , an identification between the unperturbed and perturbed manifolds , i.e.  a mapping @xmath7 , which establishes a one - to - one correspondence between the points of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the identification is not unique and thus chosen arbitrarily at first order in the perturbations .",
    "the mapping @xmath8 naturally induces from the coordinate system in @xmath1 a coordinate system in @xmath9 .",
    "one then defines the perturbation of a tensor @xmath10 as [ deft ] t(x)= t(x)- |t ( x ) , where @xmath11 stands for a given set of coordinates ( which define both a point in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 via the mapping ) , where @xmath10 is the full tensor defined in @xmath0 and @xmath12 is the corresponding `` unperturbed '' quantity defined in the reference spacetime @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , one defines the perturbation by comparing the values of the tensors _ at the same coordinate point _ ,",
    "i.e. at the pair of points identified by the mapping @xmath8 .",
    "as stressed above , the identification mapping is somewhat arbitrary and one must consider slight modifications of this mapping ( slight so that one stays in the domain of validity of the perturbative approach ) to get the generic picture .",
    "a change of mapping can be interpreted as a change of coordinates in the perturbed spacetime @xmath0 , which we write as [ coord_trans ] x^a x^a = x^a+x^a , which means that the _ physical point _ with the old coordinates @xmath5 has the new coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "the mapping @xmath8 , which takes the background manifold , @xmath1 , to the perturbed manifold @xmath0 , and the internal mapping @xmath15 , between the perturbed manifold and itself . to take @xmath16 to @xmath17",
    "we need @xmath8 and @xmath15.,width=264 ]    the change of any tensor under the coordinate transformation ( [ coord_trans ] ) , evaluated _ at the same old and new coordinates _ ( and thus at different physical points ) , is given by the lie derivative with respect to the vector field @xmath18 @xcite , [ ttrans ] tt(x)-t(x)=-l_x^a t .",
    "equation ( [ ttrans ] ) gives for the change of a covariant 2-tensor under a transformation ( [ coord_trans ] ) [ transform ] q_ab",
    "= q_ab-_x^c q_ab , or , substituting for the lie derivative ( see e.g. @xcite ) , [ transform2 ] q_ab = q_ab - x^c _ c",
    "q_ab -(_a x^c ) q_cb -(_b x^c ) q_ac .",
    "let us now take into account the submanifold @xmath2 .",
    "we start by introducing the unperturbed submanifold @xmath3 in the reference manifold @xmath1 . in general",
    ", there is no reason for the mapping @xmath8 to leave the submanifold invariant , i.e.  we have in general @xmath19 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mapping ] . of course",
    ", one can always choose a special subclass of mappings which do leave invariant this submanifold but this corresponds to a restricted choice of coordinate systems .",
    "note , that the gaussian normal ( gn ) coordinate system , defined below in section [ gnsec ] , belongs to this subclass .",
    "if one wishes to define perturbations for quantities existing only at the geometrical locus of the submanifold , one therefore can not use the above definition , eq .",
    "( [ deft ] ) .",
    "a necessary additional step is to define another mapping @xmath15 between the image of @xmath20 and the real @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath21 . in the coordinate system defined by @xmath8 ,",
    "this can be written in the form @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath15 maps a point of @xmath23 with coordinates @xmath5 onto a point of @xmath2 with coordinates @xmath24 .",
    "one can now define a meaningful perturbation for tensorial quantities defined at the submanifold location , _",
    "st(x)=t((()))- |t ( ) , where @xmath11 stands for the coordinates of @xmath25 , which is a point of @xmath3 .",
    "when the quantity @xmath10 is in fact defined everywhere ( but one wants to use the perturbation of its value at the location of the submanifold ) , the defining expression above can be decomposed into _",
    "st(x)=t((()))- t(())+t ( ( ) ) - |t ( ) , where one can recognize in the last two terms the usual definition of the linear perturbation .",

    "we now apply the results found in the previous section to the metric tensor of a braneworld . after briefly reviewing how the perturbed metric tensor changes under a first order coordinate transformation we show how the definition of the perturbation of the metric tensor changes in the presence of a particular submanifold , the brane .",
