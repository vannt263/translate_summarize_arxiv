    "the relativistic character of the charge carriers in graphene has attracted a lot of interest .",
    "the unconventional quantum hall effect@xcite , klein tunnelling@xcite and the landau level spectrum@xcite have shown that electrons in a layer of an hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms behave as two dimensional massless dirac particles with a velocity 300 times smaller than the speed of light .",
    "when several graphene layers are stacked on top of each other , the character of the charge carriers changes fundamentally with the number of layers and the type of stacking@xcite .",
    "the low energy behaviour of the electrons in multilayered structures can however be decomposed in a combination of multilayers with a lower number of rhombohedral stacked layers@xcite .",
    "recent experimental progress proved that it is possible to fabricate multilayer samples with a specific number of layers and a specific type of stacking@xcite .",
    "this resulted in an increased interest in the electronic properties of these multilayers.@xcite experiments support the low energy theory for both bilayer@xcite and trilayer@xcite and results for other multilayers are expected soon .",
    "one of the most peculiar properties of a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is that upon the application of a perpendicular magnetic field , the energy spectrum is completely quantized and that several thermodynamic quantities like the fermi level , magnetization and magnetic susceptibility have an oscillatory behaviour as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite this oscillatory behaviour has proven to be significantly different from the de haas- van alphen effect in three dimensional systems , indicating that it is a pure two dimensional effect .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we combine the two dimensionality of graphene with the relativistic character of the electrons to compare the thermodynamic quantities with those of a conventional 2deg .",
    "we investigate rhombohedral stacked multilayered systems using the two band approximation@xcite and present analytical formulae for different thermodynamic quantities as a function of the number of layers for zero and non zero temperature .",
    "we consider a two dimensional gas of non interacting electrons with only nearest neighbour interlayer and intralayer transitions .",
    "this allows us to present an analytical theory which can form the basis of a more in depth analysis that does include these corrections.@xcite .",
    "we find that our results are fundamentally different from those of a 2deg due to the different landau level spectrum and in particular because of the presence of a highly degenerate zero energy landau level .",
    "the results however still show the vanishing magnetization at zero magnetic field , which is a signature of the two dimensionality of the system .    in the first two sections , sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : llquantization ] , of the paper at hand we discuss respectively the electronic properties of graphene multilayers and the way the spectrum discretizes into landau levels .",
    "then we calculate the oscillations of the fermi level , the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility for zero temperature in sec .",
    "[ sec : zerot ] and for finite temperature in sec .",
    "[ sec : finitet ] . in sec",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we conclude the analysis with a summary and some remarks concerning many - body interactions and additional transitions .",
    "as discussed before@xcite , the valence and conduction band in multilayer graphene touch each other in two inequivalent points in reciprocal space , the so called dirac points . therefore , the low energy behaviour of the charge carriers in graphene multilayers reside in the energy valleys near these two points . because of",
    "the high energy barrier between both valleys , we consider them to be uncoupled so their presence can be solely incorporated in the degeneracy of the electron states .    near the dirac point",
    ", the energy spectrum can be decomposed in non - interacting pseudospin doublets with chirality @xmath0 .",
    "these pseudospin doublets have a similar low energy spectrum as that of a rhombohedrally stacked multilayer with @xmath0 layers .",
    "its hamiltonian can be approximated by @xmath1 ,   \\label{hamiltonianmultilayer}\\]]where@xcite @xmath2 m / s is the fermi velocity in monolayer graphene , @xmath3 with @xmath4 the in - plane momentum and @xcite @xmath5ev is the interlayer hopping parameter .",
    "note that we have omitted the minus sign in front of @xmath6 due to electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relation is @xmath7the energy , @xmath8 , is here expressed in units of the interlayer hopping parameter , i.e. @xmath9 .    the two - band approximation neglects the skew hopping parameters@xcite @xmath10ev and @xmath11ev that give rise to trigonal warping and to a violation of electron - hole symmetry@xcite which becomes only visible for large energy , i.e. @xmath12 . also the @xmath13ev and @xmath14 ev parameters are neglected because they correspond to next - to - nearest - neighbour interlayer transitions .",
    "the validity of the two - band approximation is therefore limited to energies @xmath15 .",
    "however , we can take eq .",
    "@xmath16 also as a model hamiltonian which allows us to obtain many results analytically .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) of the two dimensional electron gas in multilayer graphene depends strongly on the power law of the dispersion relation .",
    "this is a big difference with respect to that of the normal 2deg .",
    "the dos per unit area @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 this expression incorporates the extra valley degeneracy as the additional factor @xmath19 . in fig .",

    "these two sublattices are the only two that do not lie directly below or above another sublattice in a rhombohedral multilayer . for monolayer graphene , they are the two inequivalent sublattices that are responsible for the pseudospin properties of the electrons . using this two - spinor , one obtains the set of equations @xmath34with the dimensionless energy @xmath35 .",

    "the zell is half filled with electrons and half with holes@xcite and therefore it gives rise to the unconventional quantum hall effect which has been observed in graphene multilayer structures@xcite . due to its high degeneracy",
    "it has also attracted a lot of attention recently in the framework of fractional quantum hall studies and other many body effects@xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the thermodynamic properties of the electron gas in graphene multilayer structures , we renumber the lls by @xmath53 , so the energy spectrum changes into @xmath54where the degeneracy of the @xmath55 ll is multiplied by a factor @xmath0 to account for the states corresponding to @xmath56 .",
