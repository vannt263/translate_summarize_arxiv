    "the _ quantum entropy _ ( or , equivalently , _ von neumann entropy _ ) was defined by von neumann around 1927 for proving the irreversibility of quantum measurement processes @xcite .",
    "precisely , the quantum entropy is an extension of the gibbs entropy to the quantum realm and it may be viewed as the average information the experimenter obtains in the repeated observations of many copies of an identically prepared mixed state .",
    "it has a fundamental role for studying correlated systems and for defining entanglement measures @xcite . in the present work we elaborate on the notion of quantum entropy applied to networks .",
    "since the quantum entropy is defined for quantum states , the first required ingredient is therefore a method to map graphs / networks into states ( while the converse is not necessary in our purpose ) .",
    "the literature comprises different ways to associate graphs to certain states or dynamics .",
    "notably , graph - states and spin networks , just to mention two major ones : graph - states are certain quantum error correcting codes , important for characterizing the computational resources in measurement based quantum computation @xcite ; spin networks are arrangements of interacting quantum mechanical particles , nowadays of great significance for the development of nanotechnologies @xcite .",
    "we take a straightforward approach , and take into analysis an entropic quantity for graphs on the basis of a faithful mapping between discrete laplacians and quantum states , firstly introduced by braunstein _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in synthesis",
    ", we see the spectrum of an appropriately normalized laplacian as a distribution and we compute its shannon entropy @xcite ( which measures the amount of uncertainty of a random variable , or the amount of information obtained when its value is revealed ) .",
    "such a quantity finds a natural place among those _ global _ spectral parameters of graphs ( _ i.e. _ , involving the entire spectrum and not just a specific eigenvalue ) studied in connection to natural and social networks .",
    "for example , the estrada index , a measure of centrality @xcite , also used to quantify the degree of folding of long - chain molecules @xcite ; or the _ graph energy _ , that in hckel theory corresponds to the sum of the energies of all the electrons in a molecule @xcite .",
    "( see the book chapter @xcite , for a general review on complexity measures for graphs . )",
    "we give evidence that the quantum entropy is a measure of regularity for graphs , _",
    "i.e. _ , regular graphs have in general higher entropy when the number of edges is fixed .",
    "moreover , entropy seems to depend on the number of connected components , long paths , and nontrivial symmetries .",
    "chosen the number of edges , entropy is smaller for graphs with large cliques and short paths , _",
    "i.e. _ , graphs in which the vertices form an highly connected cluster .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ two ]",
    "we introduce the required definitions and focus on some basic properties . by adding edges one by one to the empty graph",
    ", we try to construct graphs with minimum and maximum entropy . in section [ egs ]",
    "we explore the influence of the graph structure on the entropy .",
    "we consider different classes of graphs : regular graphs , random graphs , and the star as an extremal case of scale - free graph ( _ i.e. _ , graphs for which the degree distribution follows a power law ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for large number of vertices shows that regular graphs tend to have maximum entropy .",
    "we study numerically how the entropy increases when adding edges with different prescriptions .",
    "once fixed the number of edges , the entropy is minimized by graphs with large cliques .",
