    "broad emission lines ( bels ) are a defining property of quasar spectra .",
    "nearly 25 years ago baldwin ( 1977 ) discovered an anti - correlation between the equivalent width in iv civ@xmath6 , @xmath7(iv civ ) , and the continuum luminosity , @xmath8(1450  ) , measured at 1450 in the quasar rest - frame .",
    "this result was based on a sample of 20 quasars spanning @xmath9 orders of magnitude in continuum luminosity in the redshift range @xmath10 .",
    "it has become known as the `` baldwin effect '' ( hereafter beff ) .",
    "the beff was subsequently confirmed in iv civ@xmath6 , as well as other bels such as ly@xmath11  and ovi@xmath1 ( vron - cetty , vron , & tarenghi 1983 ; baldwin , wampler , & gaskell 1989 ; kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 ; osmer , porter , & green 1994 ; zheng , kriss , & davidsen 1995 ; green , forster , & kuraszkiewicz 2001 ; see osmer & shields 1999 for a recent review ) .",
    "a major impetus for studying the beff was that it might be useful for calibrating active galactic nuclei ( agns ) luminosities , e.g. based on @xmath7(iv civ ) .",
    "the agns could then be used as cosmological standard candles .",
    "but in the following years studies of bigger quasar samples revealed a large scatter in the anti - correlation of the continuum luminosity vs. emission line strength ( baldwin , wampler , & gaskell 1989 ; zamorani et al.1992 ) .",
    "the beff is nonetheless important as a diagnostic of agn structure and , perhaps , metal abundances ( korista , baldwin , & ferland 1998 ) .",
    "the relation between the continuum luminosity and the relative emission line strengths and ratios can be used to study the evolution and physics of the quasar phenomenon ( baldwin 1999 ) . in particular",
    ", this correlation can be used to test model predictions for the dependence of the shape of the continuum spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity ( binette et al.1989 ; netzer , laor , & gondhalekar 1992 ; zheng & malkan 1993 ; wandel 1999a , b ) .    the most fundamental problem , however , is that the physical cause of the beff remains unknown .",
    "it was suggested by mushotzky & ferland ( 1984 ) that the observed relation can be explained by an anti - correlation of the ionization parameter , u , and the continuum luminosity , with @xmath12 , where q(h ) is the number of hydrogen ionizing photons emitted per second by the central continuum source , r is the distance between the continuum source and the emission line region , and @xmath13 is the hydrogen density in the line - emitting cloud .",
    "assuming an additional relation of decreasing covering factor with increasing continuum strength , the observed beff could be well described for iv civ@xmath6 .",
    "however , this model does not naturally explain the beff in the full range of measured lines .",
    "it predicts , for example , a lack of a beff for ly@xmath11 even though it is clearly detected ( e.g. , kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 ; osmer , porter , & green 1994 ; laor et al.1995 ; green 1996 ) .",
    "another important clue to the physical cause of the beff is that the strength of the relationship ( i.e. , the slope of the @xmath14  @xmath15 anti - correlation ) seems to depend on the ionization energy of the emission - line species ( zheng et al.1995 ; espey & andreadis 1999 ) . in particular , the equivalent widths of high - ionization lines like ovi@xmath1 decrease more dramatically with @xmath15 than lines with moderate ionization energies like iv civ@xmath6 or low ionization energies like mgii@xmath16 and balmer emission lines .",
    "our results in the present paper confirm this claim , and improve upon the overall empirical characterization of the beff correlations .",
    "the beff might result from a more fundamental correlation between the continuum luminosity , @xmath15 , and the shape of the ionizing ( euv  soft x - ray ) continuum ( binette et al.1989 ; zheng & malkan 1993 ; zheng et al.1997 ; korista et al.1998 ) .",
    "netzer ( 1985 , 1987 ) and netzer et al.(1992 ) suggested accretion disc models to explain the observed continuum and emission line correlations .",
    "recently , wandel ( 1999a , b ) added to this the growth in black hole mass by accretion in the accretion disc model .",
    "his analysis predicts that the continuum luminosity increases towards higher black hole mass and that the shape of the ionizing continuum becomes softer .",
    "hence , it is suggested that the beff is driven by a softening of the ionizing continuum towards higher luminosities .",
    "this model is attractive because the uv  x - ray spectral softening has been well documented by observations ( tananbaum et al.1986 ; wilkes et al.1994 ; green et al.1995 ) , and because the spectral softening provides a natural explanation for steeper beff slopes in higher ionization lines .",
    "an additional possibility is that the beff is driven , at least in part , by a trend for higher metallicities in more luminous agns .",
    "korista et al.(1998 ) presented theoretical results showing the dependence of the emission line equivalent widths on both the continuum shape and the metallicity of the gas .",
    "their proposal is based on evidence for higher metal abundances in more luminous quasars ( hamann & ferland 1993 , 1999 ; dietrich et al .",
    "1999 ; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ) , and on the suggestion that more luminous quasars reside in more massive host galaxies , which will naturally be more metal rich ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; pettini 1999 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; granato et al.2001 ; see hamann & ferland 1999 for a review ) .",
    "our combination of ground - based and satellite data also provides the opportunity to study evolutionary aspects of the line strengths in detail  e.g. by measuring the same rest - frame uv lines across a wide range of redshifts .",
    "one serious complication affecting previous work is that luminosity and redshift are often correlated in quasars samples , because the quasars are selected from magnitude - limited surveys .",
    "most studies have supported the original claim by baldwin ( 1977 ) , that w@xmath17 scales inversely with luminosity and that there is no significant trend with redshift @xmath18 ( e.g. , kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 ; osmer et al.1994 ; francis & koratkar 1995 ; wilkes et al.1999 ) . however , some recent work based on the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) claims that the relationship to redshift is even stronger than with luminosity ( forster et al.2001 ; green , forster , & kuraszkiewicz 2001 ) .",
    "the present paper is the first in a series in which we examine the emission - line properties in a large sample of @xmath19 type 1 agns .",
    "the sample includes seyfert1 galaxies and both radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars spanning an unprecedented wide range in both redshift ( @xmath20 ) and intrinsic luminosity ( @xmath21 orders of magnitude ) .",
    "the database and data processing will be described in detail in a future paper .",
    "a major concern regarding beff studies is that selection effects in agn samples , e.g. pertaining to emission - line strengths , might bias some measurements of the beff .",
    "our sample has the advantage of being drawn from a variety of surveys , with objects selected based on radio properties , grism spectroscopy , or broad - band color criteria .",
    "hence , no specific selection criteria were applied for the data .",
    "another key advantage is that our sample includes a wide range of luminosities at various redshifts .",
    "we can therefore address the separate redshift and luminosity dependences in the emission line data .",
    "there are several interesting problems we wish to address .",
    "the most basic issue is to quantify the nature of empirical correlations with @xmath15 and/or @xmath18 . in an upcoming study",
    "we will further examine correlations with other agn properties such as radio - loudness ( baldwin 1977 ; sargent , steidel , & boksenberg 1989 ; steidel & sargent 1991 ; francis & koratkar 1995 ) .",
    "we will also report on trends with @xmath15 or @xmath18 among various emission - line metallicity indicators . here",
    "we present an initial analysis on the nature of the beff .",
    "our approach is to construct composite spectra for specific @xmath15 and @xmath18 intervals , thus providing high signal - to - noise spectra and allowing us to study trends in both weak and strong emission lines .",
    "the agn sample is described briefly in  2  and the calculation and analysis of the composite spectra in  3 and  4 .",
    "the main results appear in several figures in  5 .",
    "we compare our results with prior studies and discuss them in the context of suggested models in  6 . throughout this paper",
    "we use the cosmological parameters h@xmath22 kms@xmath23mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) .",
    "introducing @xmath26 ( netterfield et al.2002 ) instead of @xmath27 , the luminosities at the highest redshifts would be @xmath28%  smaller , while at low redshifts they would reach a maximum of @xmath29%  larger at redshift @xmath30 .",
    "we have compiled a large sample of rest - frame visible and ultraviolet spectra for @xmath31 type 1 agns .",
    "a majority of the spectra were obtained by several groups for different studies over the last 20 years using ground - based instruments as well as _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ and _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ ( bahcall et al.1993 ; baldwin et al.1989 ; chaffee et al.1991 ; corbin & boroson 1996 ;",

    ", the sample contains 351 quasar spectra measured with _",
    "hst_. furthermore , we observed a large number of the quasars in our sample at redshifts @xmath32 ( constantin et al.2002 ; dietrich et al.1999 ; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ; dietrich et al.2002a , b ) . for this study",
    "we exclude broad - absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) , although there are indications that their emission line properties do not differ from non - bal quasars ( weymann et al.1991 ) .",
    "we also excluded several quasar spectra with extremely poor signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the sample we investigate consists of @xmath19 type 1 agns .",
    "because this agn sample was compiled from many independent projects , it encompasses a wide range of selection criteria .",
    "most of the quasars especially at high redshifts were discovered by color selection techniques ( e.g. , storrie - lombardi et al.1996 ) or found by objective prism surveys ( e.g. , chaffee et al.1991 ; sargent et al.1988,1989 ; schneider at al.1991a , b ) .",
    "we used the radio flux densities given in vron - cetty & vron ( 2001 ) to determine the radio loudness for the quasars .",
    "following kellermann et al.(1989 ) we calculated the parameter @xmath33 with @xmath34 as the radio flux density at @xmath35ghz and @xmath36 as the b - band flux , each in the rest frame .",
    "our classifications of radio - loud quasars are consistent with classifications available in the literature ( wills et al.1995 ; bischof & becker 1997 ; wilkes et al.1999 ; stern et al.2000 ) . in total",
    "our sample contains @xmath37 radio - loud quasars and @xmath38 radio - quiet agns .",
    "kinney et al.(1990 ) and pogge & peterson ( 1992 ) pointed out that a significant fraction of the scatter in the beff in seyfert1 galaxies is caused by variability .",
    "they found that observations obtained at multiple epochs for individual sources display a beff - like correlation ( the _ intrinsic _ beff ) , but with a significantly steeper slope than the beff observed for an ensemble of agns .",
    "the physical mechanisms which drive each effect might be different , i.e. , the ensemble beff might be due primarily to variations in black hole mass while the intrinsic beff might be caused by changes of the accretion rate @xmath39 ( green 1999 ) . for @xmath40 of the @xmath41 low luminosity agns ( log@xmath42 , for @xmath43 in ergs@xmath23 ) ,",
    "the spectra are means from intense monitoring campaigns ( crenshaw et al.1996 ; collier et al.1998,2001 ; dietrich et al.1993 ; goad et al.1999 ; kaspi et al.1996 ; korista et al.1995 ; peterson et al.1994 ; reichert et al.1994 ; santos - lle et al.2001 ; stirpe et al.1994 ; wanders et al.1997 ) . at the high luminosity end of the luminosity distribution",
    ", it has been shown that quasars vary on longer timescales and with smaller amplitudes ( e.g. , kaspi et al.2000 ) .",
    "for these reasons , the scatter caused by intrinsic variability is not expected to strongly influence our analysis of the present large quasar sample , particularly when comparisons of composite spectra are employed .",
    "we transformed each quasar spectrum to the rest - frame using a redshift measured from iv civ@xmath6 . to determine the redshift we fit a gaussian profile to the upper part of the iv civ@xmath6 emission line having @xmath44%  of the peak intensity .",
    "we corrected each spectrum for galactic extinction ( seaton 1979 ) , based on the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath45 expressed in units of @xmath46@xmath47 , assuming @xmath48 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of the quasar sample is presented in figure 1 as a function of continuum luminosity , @xmath49 .",
    "the quasars cover a redshift range of @xmath0 and nearly @xmath50 orders of magnitude in luminosity . for",
    "most of the redshift range a reasonable coverage in luminosity is achieved , spanning at least @xmath51 orders of magnitude for @xmath52 .",
    "the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars are displayed with different symbols in figure 1 .",
    "their distributions across luminosity and redshift are very similar within out sample , although the fraction of radio - loud quasars increases for redshifts @xmath53 .",
    "a common approach to study the beff is to measure the emission line properties of individual quasars .",
    "however , the results are often limited especially for the weaker emission lines by the low signal - to - noise ratio of individual spectra .",
    "there can also be significant problems introduced by including upper limits on weak lines in individual spectra . to avoid those problems , we computed composite spectra in different intervals of redshift and luminosity .",
    "the analysis of these spectra has the advantage of more clearly representing the average properties of the sample used to calculate each composite .",
    "figure 1 indicates the ranges in luminosity and redshift used to compute the composites . except for the low and high luminosity ends of our sample ,",
    "each composite spectrum is based on more than @xmath54 individual quasar spectra .",
    "the scatter introduced by different individual spectra is taken into account by calculating a root - mean - square ( standard deviation ) spectrum for each composite , and using that to estimate the uncertainties in the measured equivalent widths (  4 ) .    before combining the individual quasar spectra , we normalized the flux densities to unity in a @xmath54  wide continuum range centered at @xmath55  by multiplying each spectrum with a suitable factor .",
    "we used these normalized quasar spectra to calculate the mean and rms spectrum for each composite , and the number of spectra contributing in each wavelength bin .    to avoid the influence of strong narrow absorption lines , we developed a search routine to detect strong narrow absorption features and exclude them from the calculation of the composite spectrum . to search for strong absorption lines we applied the following method ( a more detailed description will be given in a subsequent paper on the properties of the entire quasar sample , dietrich et al.2002c ) .",
    "first , a preliminary mean spectrum is calculated for the sample of spectra under study .",
    "we then divided each individual spectrum by this preliminary mean to derive a ratio spectrum .",
    "each ratio spectrum is smoothed with a running boxcar function , which provides in addition to the mean also an rms value for each wavelength box .",
    "the resulting rms spectrum indicates the scatter in flux for each wavelength element in the immediate spectral region . a narrow absorption line will cause a sharp increase in the rms spectrum .",
    "the contaminated spectral regions of individual spectra , identified by these rms spikes , are excluded from the calculation of the final composite spectrum , and no interpolation has been applied .",
    "multiple tests with different agns and different sample sizes show that this technique sucessfully removes strong narrow absorption lines from our composite spectra ( see below ) without affecting the emission lines .",
    "significant effects of narrow absorption lines remain only in the ly@xmath56 forest ( @xmath57 ) for composites that include quasars with redshift @xmath52 .    the resulting composite quasar spectrum for the entire sample is shown in figure 2 . a single power law fit to the continuum at @xmath58   is also displayed ; it has a slope of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this spectral index is consistent with the slope reported for other composite spectra ( brotherton et al.2001 ; vandenberk et al.2001 ; telfer et al.2002 ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 2 shows the number of quasars contributing to each individual wavelength element . for every wavelength @xmath61  this composite quasar spectrum",
    "is based on at least @xmath62 quasars .",
    "to measure the emission line fluxes we analyzed each composite spectrum with spectral fitting software provided by midas .",
    "we employed a powerlaw continuum , an ultraviolet and optical fe - emission template , a balmer continuum emission template , and multiple gaussian profiles for the broad emission lines in multi - component fits using @xmath63 minimization . for the ultraviolet wavelength range we used the fe emission template",
    "which vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) carefully derived from hst spectra of izw1 ( kindly provided by m.vestergaard ) .",
    "the primary aim was to measure the broad and prominent feii - emission near mgii@xmath16 .",
    "however , we also used the uv template to correct for feii and feiii emission blended with iii ciii]@xmath64 and other lines across the wavelength range @xmath65 . for the optical wavelength region around h@xmath66  and h@xmath67",
    ", we used the empirical feii  emission template obtained from izw1 ( kindly provided by t.boroson ; boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "we adjusted the line widths in these fe emission templates to match the measured widths of iv civ@xmath6 , mgii@xmath16 , or h@xmath3 .",
    "we calculated several bound - free balmer continuum emission spectra for @xmath68k , @xmath69@xmath70 , and @xmath71 following the formalism suggested by grandi ( 1982 ) .",
    "these balmer continuum emission templates were supplemented for @xmath72  with high order balmer emission lines with @xmath73 , i.e. h@xmath74 and higher ( storey & hummer 1995 ) .",
    "the individual high - order balmer lines were represented by gaussian profiles and coadded .",
    "the multi - component fit of a balmer continuum , two fe - emission templates , and a power law continuum yields independent measurements of the ultraviolet and optical fe - emission strengths .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index , @xmath56 , of the power law continuum does not include contributions from balmer continuum or from broad fe emission .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the fit of balmer continuum emission and fe emission templates were estimated from the @xmath63 distribution for each fit ( cf .",
    ", dietrich et al.2002a ) .",
    "the emission line fluxes were measured after subtracting the power law continuum , balmer continuum , and fe emission spectra .",
    "the line fluxes were determined by multi - component gaussian fits . in general",
    ", we fit the emission lines with a `` broad '' and a `` narrow '' gaussian component . for iv",
    "civ@xmath6 , however , it was necessary to introduce in addition a very broad component ( which turned out to have typically fwhm @xmath75 kms@xmath23 ) .",
    "to determine the fluxes of ly@xmath11 and nv@xmath5 , which are severely blended , we used the components obtained from the iv civ@xmath6 profile as templates ( preserving their widths and redshifts ) .",
    "please see figure 2 in dietrich & hamann ( 2002d ) for examples of fitted profiles .",
    "note that most of the ly@xmath11 forest absorption on the blue side of the ly@xmath11 profile is corrected by the methode we applied to calculated the composite spectra .",
    "the ovi@xmath1 emission line is subject to severe corruption by ly@xmath11  forest absorption .",
    "however , in composite spectra it can be assumed that the same fraction of the ovi@xmath1 emission line flux and the adjacent continuum flux is absorbed by the ly@xmath11  forest .",
    "hence , the equivalent width is not expected to be significantly altered by ly@xmath11  forest absorption .",
    "the ovi@xmath1 emission line is also contaminated by ly@xmath66  emission in the blue wing , whose relative strength shows a wide range , ly@xmath66/ovi@xmath76 ( laor et al.1995 ) .",
    "our fits to the ovi@xmath1 emission line profiles were achieved with a broad and narrow gaussian profile , and no additional component due to ly@xmath66  emission was necessary .",
    "the iii ciii]@xmath64 emission line complex was reconstructed with four gaussian profiles , corresponding to aliii@xmath77 , siiii]@xmath78 , and broad and narrow gaussian profiles for iii ciii]@xmath64 .",
    "the correction for fe emission allows a better measurement of mgii@xmath16 , heii@xmath79 , niii]@xmath80 , and the iii ciii ] emission line complex ( aliii@xmath77 , siiii]@xmath78 , iii ciii]@xmath64 ) .",
    "the measurement of the optical feii  emission with an appropriate scaled template made it possible to measure the heii@xmath81 emission line which is otherwise severely blended with feii(37,38 ) multiplets .",
    "the cumulative errors in the emission line flux measurements and @xmath14 were calculated as the square root of the sum of i ) the uncertainties in the @xmath63 fitting and ii ) the rms scatter that is introduced by both the noise and distribution of the individual spectra contributing to that particular composite spectrum , squared .",
    "to search for a dependence of emission line properties , particularly @xmath7 , on cosmic time ( redshift ) , we selected a narrow luminosity range .",
    "the location of this luminosity range was also selected to achieve a comparable number of individual quasars contributing to each redshift bin in the @xmath18 ",
    "@xmath49 plane . to cover a redshift range as large as possible for an almost constant luminosity",
    ", we selected a luminosity range of @xmath82 ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) .",
    "this range contains @xmath84 quasars with @xmath85 and an average luminosity of log@xmath86 .",
    "we computed composite spectra for redshift bins with @xmath87 centered on redshift @xmath88 , respectively ( fig.1 ) .",
    "figures 3a and 3b show the composite spectra for each redshift bin .",
    "these composite spectra are normalized by the power law continuum which we derived from the multi - component fits in  4 .    as a first impression the relative line strengths in the normalized composite quasar spectra",
    "stay nearly constant with redshift @xmath18 .",
    "however , some emission lines show a marginal trend for increasing equivalent width at the highest redshifts . to quantify this result , we measured the equivalent width of most emission lines in the ultraviolet wavelength range ( @xmath89 ) and of the broad ultraviolet feii - emission feature ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the results for @xmath14 as a function of redshift are displayed in figures 4a and 4b . in general , the equivalent widths of the lines remain constant within @xmath91% . the stronger emission lines , however , like ly@xmath11 , iv civ@xmath6 , and iii ciii]@xmath64 , show marginal trends for a relation of @xmath14 and redshift .",
    "@xmath14 stays nearly constant within less than @xmath92%  for redshifts less than @xmath93 , but then for @xmath94 there are marginal indications for a slight increase of @xmath14 at constant luminosity .",
    "close inspection of figures 4a and 4b indicates that in particular the equivalent widths measured for the composites with @xmath95 are larger compared to lower redshifts .",
    "most of the quasar spectra in our sample with @xmath95 were obtained by constantin et al.(2002 ) .",
    "they found evidence that in spite of strong contamination by ly@xmath11-forest absorption , ly@xmath11  is stronger for quasars with @xmath96 than in their low-@xmath18 counterparts .      next we divided the quasar sample into eleven subsets with respect to the luminosity @xmath97 . except for the lowest luminosity bin ,",
    "each composite spectrum covers a range of @xmath98 in luminosity starting at log@xmath99 ergs@xmath23 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the two lowest luminosity composite spectra consist of less than 10 objects .",
    "figures 5a and 5b show the composite spectra ordered by luminosity for the ultraviolet wavelength range ( @xmath100 ) , while figure 6 shows the longer wavelengths ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "each composite spectrum is normalized by the power law continuum fit we derived from the multi - component analysis (  3 ) .",
    "these normalized spectra show very obviously a strong relation between the equivalent width , @xmath14 , and the continuum luminosity represented by @xmath49 , i.e. the baldwin effect , for most of the emission lines .",
    "figures 7a and 7b show the measured values of @xmath14 for each luminosity interval .",
    "the beff can be seen easily in strong lines such as iv civ@xmath6 , ovi@xmath1 , ly@xmath11@xmath102 , iii ciii]@xmath64 , and mgii@xmath16 ( figures 5a and 6 ) .",
    "taking advantage of the high signal - to - noise ratio of the composite spectra , we also detected this relation for weaker emission lines such as heii@xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , emission lines of the same ion but at different wavelengths ( oiii]@xmath103 , [ oiii]@xmath2  and heii@xmath79 , heii@xmath104 ) possess nearly identical slopes ( tab.1 ) .",
    "for the first time , we report on the beff for niv]@xmath105 , oiii]@xmath103 , and niii]@xmath80 . in spite of the large scatter , the broad fe emission features in the ultraviolet",
    "show some indications of a beff , while within the errors , the optical feii  emission lacks a beff .",
    "in addition to the broad emission lines , we detect the baldwin effect also for the prominent forbidden emission line [ oiii]@xmath2  ( figure 6 ) , which is regarded as a typical narrow - line region ( nlr ) emission line .",
    "in contrast to the strong beff in most of the emission lines visible in figures 5a , 5b , and 6 , the balmer lines h@xmath67  and h@xmath66  show only weak indications of a baldwin effect , which might be restricted to the line center of the line profiles .",
    "close inspection of the nv@xmath5 emission line ( figures 5a and 8) also indicates that this line does not exhibit a beff like other high ionization lines .",
    "lines having the same equivalent widths in each individual spectrum will cancel out in difference spectra ( provided that their profiles are also the same ) , while lines whose equivalent widths are a function of luminosity will still be present in difference spectra .",
    "note that nv@xmath5 has on average cancelled out in the difference spectra as shown in figure 8 .",
    "hence , the difference spectra near nv  and the careful deblending of the ly@xmath11-nv@xmath5 emission line complex both reveal that nv@xmath5 remains nearly constant in @xmath14 over @xmath21 orders of magnitude in continuum luminosity .",
    "zheng , fang , & binette ( 1992 ) , espey et al.(1993 ) , and espey & andreadis ( 1999 ) have suggested that there is a correlation between the ionization energy , @xmath106 , of a specific emission line and the strength ( slope ) of the beff .",
    "in contrast to espey & andreadis ( 1999 ) , we use the ionization energy necessary to create the ion for collisionally excited lines like iv civ@xmath107 and mgii@xmath16 , and the ionization energy needed to ionize the ion for recombination lines like ly@xmath11  and heii .",
    "the beff slope of the lines under study shows a relatively close linear correlation with @xmath106 ( figures 7a , b ) .",
    "we determined the slope @xmath3 , where log@xmath108 , of the beff from a linear least square fit to log@xmath14 vs. log@xmath109 .",
    "the fits were calculated taking into account the full uncertainties in log@xmath14 .",
    "first , we calculated the slopes across the entire luminosity range , shown by the dotted line in figures 7a and 7b .",
    "however , several of the emission lines indicate that the slope of the beff is flatter at lower luminosities ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "therefore , we calculated additional linear fits for the luminosity range log@xmath111 ( dashed - dotted lines ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lines showing a change in the beff slope have high ionization energies with @xmath112ev .",
    "the slopes of the log@xmath14 vs. log@xmath109 relations are listed in table 1 and plotted against @xmath106 in figure 9 for the entire range ( filled symbols ) and for log@xmath111 ( open symbols ) .",
    "notice , that the slope of the beff becomes steeper for increasing @xmath113 .",
    "however , as has already been shown by earlier studies , nv@xmath5 deviates significantly from this trend ( espey & andreadis 1999 ) .",
    "nv@xmath5 stays constant or shows a slightly decreasing w@xmath17 towards higher luminosity .",
    "the slope @xmath3 for ovi@xmath1 is of particular interest for testing the hypothesis of a steeper beff towards higher ionization energies since @xmath114 is more than twice @xmath115 and nearly @xmath116 times @xmath117 . assuming a constant ratio of ly@xmath66/ovi@xmath118 does not significantly change the slope of the beff for ovi@xmath1",
    "however , @xmath3(ovi@xmath1 ) would become steeper by nearly @xmath119%if ly@xmath66  follows the same beff as ly@xmath11  and ly@xmath66/ly@xmath11=@xmath120 ( laor et al.1995 ) .    to quantify the relationship of the beff slopes @xmath3 to @xmath106",
    ", we calculated linear least square fits to the points in figure 9 excluding the outlying data point for nv@xmath5 . the resulting slope , @xmath121 , is the same with ( @xmath122 ) or without ( @xmath123 ) the ovi@xmath1 line included .",
    "this result indicates that ovi@xmath1 does not dominate the @xmath3 versus @xmath106 relation .",
    "in general , the slopes of the baldwin effect derived here are consistent with prior investigations . however , the large range in both luminosity and redshift that distinguishes our quasar sample reveals correlations which were missed in some other studies . in particular , we can more clearly separate the trends with @xmath124 and @xmath18 , and our use of composite spectra across a wide luminosity range more accurately probes the beff slopes , e.g. , for weaker lines . in the following",
    "we provide some more detailed comparisons with earlier work .",
    "the slopes we derived for ly@xmath11@xmath102 , iv civ@xmath6 , iii ciii]@xmath64 , and mgii@xmath16 , are in good agreement with prior studies ( kinney et al.1990 ; osmer et al.1994 ; laor et al.1995 ; green 1996 ; turnshek 1997 ; zamorani et al.1992 ; zheng et al.1995 ; wang et al.1998 ; espey & andreadis 1999 ) . the steeper slopes for iv civ@xmath6 in osmer et al.(1994 ) , laor et al.(1995 ) , and green ( 1996 ) ,",
    "@xmath125 compared to @xmath126 here , might be caused by the luminosity range of their quasar samples , @xmath127 ergs@xmath23 .",
    "using only the @xmath7(iv civ ) measurements for @xmath127 ergs@xmath23 in our sample , we calculate a slope of the baldwin effect of @xmath128 for iv civ@xmath6 ( tab.1 ) .",
    "a lack of the baldwin effect for iv civ@xmath6 and iii ciii]@xmath64 is reported by wilkes et al.(1999 ) .",
    "they conclude that this is caused by the narrow - line - seyfert1 galaxies ( nlsy1s ) in their sample which decrease the strength of the baldwin effect ; a significant beff is found for both iv civ  and iii ciii ] if the nlsy1s galaxies in their sample are omitted .",
    "we note that these nlsy1s are also low luminosity agn .",
    "as can be seen in figures 5a and 5b , the baldwin relation is significantly flatter for low luminosities than at higher luminosities .",
    "any agn sample favoring a narrow luminosity range can dilute or bias the derived beff .",
    "similarly , the steeper beff slopes reported by laor et al.(1995 ) , for oi@xmath129 , cii@xmath130 , siiv@xmath131 , and heii@xmath79 can be attributed to their smaller luminosity range ( @xmath132 ergs@xmath23 ) .",
    "the slope for the baldwin effect for the high ionization emission line ovi@xmath1 ( @xmath133ev ) is also consistent with prior investigations .",
    "the reported slope @xmath66(ovi@xmath1 ) varies between @xmath134 ( zheng et al.1995 ; turnshek 1997 ) and @xmath135 ( laor et al.1995 ) , with most recent studies favoring a less steep anti - correlation ( @xmath136 ; espey & andreadis 1999 ) .",
    "wilkes et al.(1999 ) found only a marginal anti - correlation of @xmath137ovi@xmath138 and continuum luminosity .",
    "however , they noted that this result is based on just ten objects .",
    "green ( 1996 ) and green et al.(2001 ) did not detect a significant baldwin effect for ovi@xmath1 in their analysis of the large bright qso survey ( lbqs ) data set , taking all quasar spectra into account , i.e. including upper limit measurements as well .",
    "however , using only those spectra with detected ovi@xmath1 the baldwin effect is clearly present . a possible reason for the missing baldwin effect for ovi@xmath1 in their study might be the very narrow luminosity range ( @xmath139 ) covered by lbqs quasars at these wavelengths .",
    "a comparison of our figure 7a with figure 2 in green et al.(2001 ) shows that we measure the same range of ovi@xmath1 equivalent widths for this luminosity , @xmath140(ovi@xmath141 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the non - detection of the baldwin effect for this high - ionization line in green et al.(2001 ) is predominatly caused by their very small luminosity range .",
    "in contrast to wills et al.(1999 ) , we detect a significant baldwin effect for the prominent nlr emission line [ oiii]@xmath2  ( fig.7b ) .",
    "the slope @xmath3 of the anti - correlation is nearly identical to the one which we derived for oiii]@xmath103 ( tab.1 , fig.9 ) .",
    "again , the lack of a beff for [ oiii]@xmath2  in wills et al.(1999 ) might be caused by the covered luminosity range of less than two orders of magnitude .    in agreement with prior investigations , we found no significant baldwin effect for nv@xmath5 ( osmer et al.1994 ; laor et al.1995 ; turnshek 1997 ; espey & andreadis 1999 ) . instead of a decreasing equivalent width for increasing continuum strength , @xmath142 stays nearly constant , even though it has a high value of @xmath143ev .",
    "although much observational and theoretical effort has been spent to decipher the process which causes the baldwin effect , the mechanism is still unclear .",
    "several models have been suggested which emphasize different aspects , i.e. , contributions from optically thin clouds and luminosity - dependent ionization parameter , covering factor , ionizing continuum shape , and chemical composition of the gas .",
    "the dependence of the strength of the baldwin effect on the ionization energy indicates that a decreasing covering factor towards higher luminosities is not sufficient to explain the observed beff for each emission line . to explain the observed beff for iv civ@xmath6 , mushotzky & ferland ( 1984 ) presented model calculations suggesting that the beff is caused by a decrease of the ionization parameter , @xmath144 , as well as the covering factor towards higher luminosities .",
    "although this model predicts a weaker baldwin effect for lower luminosity agn , it also predicts that ly@xmath11  will lack a beff or show only a weak beff .",
    "a luminosity dependence of the covering factor might be indicated independently by measurements of x - ray absorption ( e.g. , lawrence & elvis 1982 ) .",
    "a variant of this picture was outlined by shields , ferland , & peterson ( 1995 ) , who suggested that the luminosity dependence could be caused by a luminosity - dependent covering factor of optically thin clouds which would emit preferentially high - ionization lines .",
    "the presence of this component in the blr is suggested from several aspects of variability in seyfert galaxies , as well as other arguments . while luminosity dependence of coverage by high - ionization clouds in the blr is apparently still a viable scenario for understanding the beff , this interpretation suffers from the lack of a strong physical basis for predicting this behavior ; explanations are ad hoc or phenomenological at best .",
    "several models have been advanced that focused primarily on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ionizing continuum , and its consequences .",
    "this approach was motivated by increasing evidence that the sed of the continuum becomes softer for more luminous ( e.g. , sargent & malkan 1982 ; binette et al.1989 ; schulz 1992 ; netzer et al.1992 ; zheng et al.1992 ; zheng & malkan 1993 ; green 1996 , 1998 ; wang et al.1998 ) .",
    "empirical models have been suggested which combine a powerlaw continuum and a thermal uv bump .",
    "detailed investigations of x - ray and ultraviolet continuum observations , i.e. , the overall ionizing continuum shape , yield indications that the sed becomes softer for increasing luminosity .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that @xmath145 , the two - point power index which connects the ultraviolet at 2500  to the x - ray continuum at 2kev , increases significantly with luminosity ( tananbaum et al.1986 ; wilkes et al.1994 ; green et al.1995 ) .",
    "this softening can be understood by a shift of the thermal uv - bump towards longer wavelengths in more luminous quasars , i.e. , @xmath146 increases more than @xmath147 for increasing luminosity resulting in a greater @xmath145 ( cf .",
    ", binette et al.1989 ; zheng & malkan 1993 ) .",
    "early models of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion discs focused on the consequences of the disc inclination and the location of gas relative to the disc ( netzer 1985 , 1987 ) .",
    "although these models can not explain the beff for several orders of magnitude in luminosity they provide an explanation for scatter in the @xmath15 vs. @xmath14 relation at a given luminosity .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the accretion disc continuum depends on the luminosity which is in turn related to the mass of the black hole and the accretion rate .",
    "these dependencies were suggested as the primary mechanism to cause the baldwin effect .",
    "recently , wandel ( 1999a , b ) presented an evolutionary scenario which connects the growth of the black hole mass , the accretion rate and the continuum luminosity .",
    "as the mass of the black hole increases and consequently also the luminosity , the peak temperature of the uv bump decreases .",
    "this results in a shift of the peak of the thermal uv bump to longer wavelengths , i.e. , the continuum becomes softer .",
    "netzer et al.(1992 ) calculated the log@xmath148 vs. log@xmath149 relation for a wide range of black hole masses , accretion rates , and inclination angles in geometrically thin accretion disc models .",
    "the spread of the calculated @xmath148 at a given luminosity is mainly caused by the different inclination angles of the accretion disc .",
    "assuming that our composite spectra represent an average over a variety of disc inclinations , the beff which we measured for ly@xmath11  is consistent with their model predictions .",
    "the observed ionization dependence of the baldwin effect provides strong evidence for a luminosity dependent sed of the ionizing continuum and thus favors accretion disc models .",
    "however , the detailed models discussed by wandel ( 1999b ) show that the seds of accretion discs depend in a complex way on the mass of the black hole and the accretion scenario .",
    "in particular , the cutoff energy of the thermal uv - bump is expected to depend on the black hole mass .",
    "these models also predict that luminous quasars with massive black holes should show low cutoff energies , while seyfert1 galaxies with intermediate massive black holes should display high cutoff energies .",
    "the low luminosity nlsy1 galaxies with low mass black holes should also exhibit high cutoff energies .",
    "different accretion scenarios would introduce additional scatter to this relation .    in summary ,",
    "accretion disc models provide a reasonable explanation of the baldwin effect , in particular for the ionization energy @xmath106 dependent strength .",
    "although these models indicate that the luminosity - dependent sed is a major mechanism which drives the beff , the large possible parameter space allows for additional effects .",
    "evidence for effects in addition to variations of the spectral energy distribution is given by the failure to explain the lack of a baldwin effect for another high ionization emission line , nv@xmath5 .",
    "baldwin et al.(1995 ) and korista et al.(1997 , 1998 ) introduced the `` locally optimally - emitting cloud '' ( loc ) model , which assumes that the blr cloud ensemble covers a wide range of internal densities and occurs over a wide range in distance from the central continuum source . under these conditions",
    "the emitted spectrum is controlled by powerful selection effects and the typical observed quasar spectrum can be naturally produced ( korista et al.1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "korista et al.(1998 ) computed for a wide range of different continuum slopes ( @xmath150 ) , densities ( @xmath151@xmath70 ) , and metallicities ( 0.2 to 10 times solar ) the resulting emission line spectra . in recent years there has been growing evidence that the chemical composition of quasar gas can reach several times solar metallicity with a trend of higher metallicities in more luminous quasars ( hamann & ferland 1993 , 1999 ; ferland et al.1996 , dietrich et al.1999 ; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ) .",
    "the emission lines studied by korista et al.(1998 ) follow the general trend for @xmath14 diminishing with softer continuum shapes . assuming the softer continua",
    "are related to higher luminosities , this yields the baldwin effect .",
    "however , in contrast to those emission lines , nv@xmath5 lacks a baldwin effect even though its high ionization energy @xmath143ev suggests that the decrease of @xmath14(nv ) should be strong .",
    "korista et al.(1998 ) introduced metallicity as an additional parameter to provide a possible explanation for the lack of a baldwin effect in nv@xmath5 .",
    "they found in their calculations that the equivalent width of ly@xmath11 , iv civ@xmath6 , or ovi@xmath1 show only a weak dependence on the gas metallicity , but nv@xmath5 strongly depends on it .",
    "in particular , they assume that nitrogen scales like a secondary element , so that its abundance relative to the other metals increases linearly with the overall metallicity ( e.g. , n / o @xmath152 o / h , see hamann et al.2002 ) .",
    "korista et al.(1998 ) assume that the metallicity increases with increasing agn luminosity ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) . with this abundance behavior , korista et al.(1998 )",
    "showed that the equivalent width of nv@xmath5 is not expected to display a beff .",
    "therefore , the decreasing equivalent width that should occur in nv@xmath5 as part of the normal beff is approximately compensated by the increasing relative abundance of nitrogen .",
    "the net result is that nv@xmath5 shows essentially no beff .",
    "overall , the beff slopes that we derived for the emission lines in our quasar sample are in good agreement with the predictions by korista et al .",
    "( table 1 ) .",
    "the observed slopes of iv civ@xmath153 and heii@xmath79 are smaller than expected , while the slope in niii]@xmath80 is steeper . however",
    ", if only measurements with @xmath154 ergs@xmath23 are taken into account , the observations yield a comparable steep anti - correlation as predicted by korista et al.(1998 ) .",
    "we will discuss these comparisons further in a forthcoming paper on the trends in metallicity in this dataset ( see also  6.4 below ) .      a common prediction of models that involve a softer continuum sed towards higher luminosities is a steeper slope of the baldwin effect for lines with increasing ionization energy @xmath106 ( zheng et al.1992 ; zheng & malkan 1993 ; korista et al.1998 ; wandel 1999a ) .",
    "figures 7a , b and 9 provide clear evidence for this prediction .",
    "high ionization lines like iv civ@xmath6 , heii@xmath79 , and heii@xmath104 , and especially ovi@xmath1 are particularly valuable .",
    "these emission lines respond to photoionizing energies of @xmath155ev , @xmath156ev , and @xmath157ev , respectively .",
    "hence , they can be used to probe the location of the cutoff energy of the thermal uv - bump .",
    "the strong beff in these high - ionization lines is expected if the ionizing continuum becomes softer with increasing continuum luminosity . in this case the relative number of ionizing photons with @xmath158ev decreases as the uv bump is moving towards longer wavelengths . while there is only a marginal trend for a slightly steeper baldwin effect for heii  than for iv civ",
    ", the higher ionization ovi@xmath1 line displays a significantly stronger beff ( fig.9 ) .",
    "the decrease of the relative number of ionizing photons with a softer continuum , caused by the shift of the uv bump to longer wavelengths , results in weaker high - ionization lines compared to lower ionization ones .",
    "the shift of the uv bump to longer wavelengths will affect emission lines at higher ionization energy first .",
    "in addition , the relative continuum strength beneath the emission lines will be enhanced , starting at short ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "both effects together result in smaller @xmath14 for higher luminosities .",
    "in addition to the general trend of steeper beff for higher @xmath106 , the curvature or flattening of the beff towards lower luminosities can be accommodated in the framework of some of the luminosity - dependent sed models ( e.g. , netzer et al . 1992 ; wandel 1999a ) .",
    "the flattening at low luminosities has led to suggestions that seyfert1 nuclei do not participate in the baldwin effect but have instead equivalent widths independent of luminosity ( e.g. , wampler et al.1984 ) . a close inspection of figures 7a , b provides some evidence for the tendency of a flatter slope @xmath3 of the beff at low luminosities in comparison to higher luminosities , as can be seen for several emission lines ( siiv@xmath131 , niv]@xmath105 , iv civ@xmath6 , heii@xmath79 , oiii]@xmath103 , niii]@xmath80 , heii@xmath104 ) .",
    "the turnover appears to occur near @xmath159 , in quite good agreement with predictions ( wandel 1999a ) . within this context",
    "it is interesting to note that the steepening of the baldwin effect for @xmath160 , is observed for emission lines with @xmath161ev .      for several elements we have measured more than one emission line strength .",
    "the comparison of the strength of the baldwin effect may provide information about the emission line region and the mechanism which causes the observed anti - correlation of @xmath14 and continuum luminosity .    for hydrogen",
    "we have measured two balmer emission lines ( h@xmath162 , h@xmath3 ) and ly@xmath11 .",
    "the slope of the baldwin effect of h@xmath162 and h@xmath3 is very similar and within the uncertainties consistent with zero , i.e. no baldwin effect for balmer lines .",
    "the missing baldwin effect for these lines provide some argument against a luminosity dependent covering factor , at least for the gas component which is the dominant contributor to these emission lines . while the equivalent width @xmath7(h@xmath66 ) remains nearly constant",
    ", the flux ratio ly@xmath11/h@xmath66 decreases by a factor @xmath163 from low to high luminosities ( @xmath164 to @xmath165 ) .",
    "the different behaviour of the balmer lines and ly@xmath11 might be also related to the complex physical processes of ly@xmath11 and h@xmath3 emission ( netzer et al.1995 ) .",
    "the prominent beff of ly@xmath11 and the lack of a beff for h@xmath66 may be caused in part by a relative stronger increase of the local continuum beneath ly@xmath56 compared to the optical wavelength range of h@xmath66 .",
    "however , ly@xmath11  shows a significant beff which fits well in the slope @xmath3 vs. @xmath106 relation ( fig.7a,9 ) . ly@xmath11",
    "might be blended with heii@xmath102 and ov]@xmath166 ( ferland et al.1992 ; shields et al.1995 ) . for standard blr conditions the contribution of heii@xmath102 and ov]@xmath166 are negligible ( less than @xmath28% , priv.comm.k.korista ) .",
    "but for higher densities and higher ionization parameter u , particularly for optically thin conditions , these emission lines can be quite strong compared to ly@xmath11  ( shields et al.1995 ) .",
    "because ov]@xmath166 has an ionization energy of @xmath167ev , this emission line might show a strong beff .",
    "if optically thin gas is a significant fraction of the blr gas , it might be possible that the moderate beff of ly@xmath11  might be caused at least in part by ov]@xmath166 .",
    "however , if ov]@xmath166 is a significant contamination of ly@xmath11  it is expected from the results in shields et al.(1995 ) that heii@xmath79 and iv civ@xmath6 should be stronger than observed .",
    "in addition , variability behavior in some objects suggests that the optically thin gas may contribute most strongly to the line wings ( e.g. , ferland et al.1990 ; peterson et al.1993 ) , but the part of the emission lines that changes the most with luminosity has a narrow fwhm ( e.g. , osmer et al.1994 ) . although we can not exclude that ov]@xmath166 provides some contribution to ly@xmath11",
    ", it does appear that ly@xmath11  itself shows a moderate baldwin effect in contrast to the balmer emission lines .",
    "the two emission lines of he@xmath168 which we measured , heii@xmath79 and heii@xmath104 , show very similar slopes for the baldwin effect .",
    "this behavior is expected for heii@xmath79 and heii@xmath104 as typical recombination lines .",
    "the similar slope of the beff provides also some evidence that luminosity - dependent radiative transfer effects , collisional effects or dust effects can not affect these emission lines .",
    "another line pair we measured is oiii]@xmath103 and [ oiii]@xmath169 .",
    "while the ionization energy necessary to create o@xmath170 is @xmath171ev , the excitation energies of these lines differ by a factor of @xmath172 .",
    "if the ionizing continuum becomes softer for increasing luminosity , the temperature in the emission line region should drop and hence oiii]@xmath103 should be more affected than [ oiii]@xmath169 . therefore , we might expect oiii]@xmath103 to have a steeper beff than [ oiii]@xmath169 .",
    "observationally their beffs are the same .",
    "however , the comparison of these two lines is very complicated because they differ in critical density by several orders of magnitudes ( @xmath173@xmath70 for [ oiii]@xmath169 and @xmath174@xmath70 for oiii]@xmath103 ) . in particular , [ oiii]@xmath169 forms in the narrow line region ( nlr ) , which might be heated and ionized additionally by shocks , and is , in any case , spatially distinct from the blr .",
    "the different kinematics of the oiii  emitting gas is also given by the significantly different profiles we used to measure the emission line flux and equivalent width .",

    "we have investigated a large sample of @xmath19 type1 agn covering the redshift range from @xmath181 and nearly 6 orders of magnitude in continuum luminosity . to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio , minimize the influence of peculiarities of individual quasars , and investigate weak as well as strong emission lines , we computed composite spectra representing narrow intervals in redshift and luminosity .",
