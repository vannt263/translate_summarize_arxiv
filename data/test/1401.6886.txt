    "during the last few years graphene and other carbon - based nanostructures have attracted the particular attention of many experimentallists and theorists due to their remarkable properties @xcite .",

    "one of the topical subjects , which came to the experimental attention very recently @xcite , is the van der waals and casimir interaction of graphene deposited on a substrate with the test body made of an ordinary material .",
    "theorists have already undertook a number of studies of graphene - graphene and graphene - material plate interactions using the dirac model of graphene @xcite , which assumes the linear dispersion relation for the graphene bands at low energies .",

    "@xcite , the van der waals and casimir forces between graphene and ideal metal plane were calculated at zero temperature using the lifshitz theory , where the reflection coefficients of the electromagnetic oscillations were expressed via the polarization tensor in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "the important progress was achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the force at nonzero temperature between two graphene sheets and between a graphene and a material plate was expressed via the coulomb coupling between density fluctuations . the density - density correlation function in the random - phase approximation has been used .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for graphene the relativistic effects are not essential , and that the thermal effects become crucial at much shorter separations than in the case of ordinary materials . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the graphene - graphene interaction was computed under an assumption that the conductivity of graphene can be described by the in - plane optical properties of graphite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for sufficiently large band gap parameter of graphene the thermal casimir force can vary several - fold with temperature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reflection coefficients in the lifshitz theory were expressed via the polarization tensor at nonzero temperature whose components were explicitly calculated .",
    "the detailed computations of graphene - graphene and graphene - real metal casimir interactions using this method were performed @xcite . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite the reflection coefficients of the lifshitz theory were generalized for the case of planar structures including two - dimensional sheets .",
    "the graphene - graphene and graphene - real metal interactions at both zero and nonzero temperature were computed by using the electric susceptibility ( polarizability ) of graphene expressed via the density - density correlation function .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the zero - temperature form of polarizability can be used also at room temperature .",

    "this is the reason why it would be useful to establish a link between the two approaches and to test the validity of the approximations used .    in this paper",

    ", we derive explicit expressions for both longitudinal and transverse electric susceptibilities of graphene , density - density correlation function and conductivities at arbitrary temperature .",
    "then we consider the limiting cases of the obtained expressions at zero temperature and find that the longitudinal version coincides with that derived within the random phase approximation .",
