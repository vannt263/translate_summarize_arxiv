    "thus we have a disk only with pressure and electric current in azimuthal direction . because there is no radial pressure or tension to support the gravitational attraction ,",
    "the matter distribution is unstable .",

    "the method works as follows .",
    "any small element of the matter distribution analyzed ( in our case a test particle of the streams ) is displaced slightly from its path . as a result of this displacement ,",

    "so we have a balance between the total force @xmath78 and the centrifugal force .",
    "we now consider the particle to be initially in a circular orbit with radius @xmath79 and we slightly displace it to a higher orbit @xmath80 .",
