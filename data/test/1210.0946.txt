    "mri plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of acute ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury .",
    "a rigorous understanding of mri begins with the elementary particles which give rise to the magnetic properties of tissue .",
    "elementary particles have two independent properties which manifest magnetic moments : ( i ) orbital angular momentum , and ( ii ) intrinsic spin .",
    "these two properties are independent only to first order , as it was their very interaction via spin - orbit coupling which led to detectable energy differences in the hydrogen spectrum , and consequently to the discovery of intrinsic spin .",
    "we discuss both properties in this paper in the context of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the hydrogen atom @xmath0h is the most frequently targeted nucleus in mri due largely to its biological abundance and high gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the @xmath0h nucleus consists of a single proton .",
    "protons are made of quarks , specifically one down and two up quarks , each of which are of spin 1/2 .",
    "the charge and spin of the proton are both directly due to its quark composition .",
    "the down quark has a charge of -1/3 while the up quarks each have charge + 2/3 , which all sums up to a charge of + 1 .",
    "the nuclear spin is 1/2 by virtue of spin cancellation from the antiparallel alignment of two of the three quarks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section  ( [ sec : mri ] ) presents an overview of the mri , section  ( [ sec : stroke ] ) reviews the mri assessment of acute ischemic stroke , section  ( [ sec : h_atom ] ) describes the hydrogen atom and reviews an analytical solution to its schrdinger equation , section  ( [ sec : spin ] ) reviews intrinsic spin , section  ( [ sec : adding ] ) reviews quantum mechanical addition of orbital angular momentum and spin , section  ( [ sec : groups ] ) reviews group theory of su(2 ) and so(3 ) and their relationship , and section  ( [ sec : summary ] ) summarizes this review .",
    "the mri section , section  ( [ sec : mri ] ) , contains a number of subsections which are outlined as follows : subsection  ( [ subsec : scales ] ) discusses the hierarchy of scales in mri phenomenology , subsection  ( [ subsec : magnetism_e_n ] ) reviews the magnetism of electrons and nucleons , subsection  ( [ subsec : mag_potential ] ) reviews the magnetic potential energy and its role in the descriptions of magnetization , torque , force , and larmor precession , subsection  ( [ subsec : pulse_mag ] ) reviews pulse magnetization , subsection  ( [ subsec : equilibrium_mag ] ) describes equilibrium magnetization , subsection  ( [ subsec : t1 ] ) describes spin - lattice or t@xmath1 recovery , subsection  ( [ subsec : t2 ] ) describes spin - spin or t@xmath2 decay , subsection  ( [ subsec : fid ] ) reviews free inductance decay , subsection  ( [ subsec : bloch ] ) reviews the bloch equations , subsection  ( [ subsec : contrast ] ) overviews intravenous contrast agents in mri , subsection  ( [ subsec : gradient ] ) reviews gradient - based band - selection method for mri space localization , and subsection  ( [ subsec : machine ] ) reviews the components of the mri machine .    the stroke section , section  ( [ sec : stroke ] ) , contains a number of subsections which are outlined as follows : subsection  ( [ subsec : dwi ] ) reviews diffusion weighted imaging ( dwi ) , subsection  ( [ subsec : pwi ] ) reviews perfusion weighted imaging ( pwi ) , subsection  ( [ subsec : dwi_pwi ] ) reviews the combination of dwi and pwi and its utility in imaging the penumbra , subsection  ( [ subsec : mrs ] ) reviews magnetic resonance spectroscopy , subsection  ( [ subsec : bold ] ) reviews blood oxygen level dependent ( bold ) imaging , and subsection  ( [ subsec : mra ] ) reviews mra .",
    "appnedix ( a ) reviews the signals processing involved in mri , including the fourier transforms , the canonical sampling theorem , and the convolution theorem .",
    "the mri is an optical technology whose core equation is the maxwell - faraday equation .",
    "it exploits ensemble phenomena in which the composition of a sample can be probed by sensing its magnetic properties through radio frequency waves . here",
    ", we describe the various parts of mri and their respective roles in the whole .      the hierarchy of scales in the modeling of magnetic resonance imaging proceeds from the subnuclear scale of quarks and gluons , to the subatomic scale of discrete electrons and nucleons , and finally to the bulk sample scale where ensemble effects and statistical mechanics are the operative physics . in a general sense ,",
    "the subnuclear scale is coupled to quantum field theory , the subatomic scale is coupled to quantum mechanics , and the bulk sample scale is coupled to classical electromagnetics .",
    "certain phenomena in mri are only meaningful over specific regimes . for instance , a magnetic moment experiences a torque when an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "however , the concept of torque is a classical concept .",
    "it is deterministic and continuous , and is meaningful only at the level of ensemble or bulk effect . on the microscopic level , such as on the scale of single electrons and nucleons , quantum mechanics is the operative physics , and state transitions are quantized .",
    "this is encoded in the time evolution of quantum states governed by an appropriate hamiltonian , yielding the specific schrdinger equation that applies in that setting .",
    "although pedagogically separable , the scales are intrinsically linked physically .",
    "for instance , the bulk magnetization , @xmath3 , is the net sum of the atomic level magnetic moments , @xmath4 .",
    "similarly the pulse magnetization frequency used to torque the bulk magnetization vector and change its direction is a radio frequency wave , @xmath5 , oscillating at the larmor frequency of the individual nucleons .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 takes its effect by acting directly on the individual electrons and nucleons , causing them to precess in phase .",
    "electrons , protons , and neutrons are magnets .",
    "they derive their magnetism from intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum . in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field ,",
    "this results in bulk magnetism of sample tissue .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment , @xmath6 , of a single unpaired electron or nucleon is given by ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the gyromagnetic ratio measured in hz / t ( hertz per tesla ) and @xmath9 is the spin . the gyromagnetic ratio for the electron is given by ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the elementary charge , @xmath12 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath13 is the electron gyromagnetic factor ( g - factor ) , a dimensionless number whose experimental agreement with theory is near unprecedented on this scale , and thereby lends strong credibility to the theory of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "table  ( [ tab : consts ] ) shows the electron and proton g - factors . the gyromagnetic ratio for nucleons is given by ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the mass of the proton , and @xmath16 is the g - factor of the nucleon .",
    "estimated gyromagnetic ratios of some biologically - relevant nuclei are shown in table  ( [ tab : gyromag ] )  @xcite .",
    "[ tab : gyromag ]    the bohr magneton , @xmath17 , and the nuclear magneton , @xmath18 , are named quantities related to the electron and proton gyromagnetic ratios respectively , and are given by ,    @xmath19    and @xmath20    the magnetic moment of the electron is much larger than that of the nucleons , and as is discussed below , this corresponds to smaller precession , pulse , and signal frequency for protons than electrons .",
    "specifically , nucleons precess , absorb , and emit electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range .",
    "this range is non - ionizing radiation , and makes mri a safer choice than ionizing imaging modalities such as plane and computed tomography x - rays .",
    "the magnetic potential energy is ,    @xmath21    the force on a magnetic moment , the torque on a magnetic moment , and the larmor precession frequency or resonance frequency , can all be described in terms of the magnetic potential energy , @xmath22 .",
    "the magnetic moment aligns itself in either parallel or anti - parallel orientation to the external field @xmath23 .",
    "the extent of parallelism is constrained by the eigenvalues of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 operators above , such that from the geometry , the parallel and anti - parallel states make angles of @xmath26 degrees with the positive and negative z - axes respectively ( assuming @xmath23 is oriented exclusively along the z - axis ) .",
    "this process is called magnetization . in the case of a population sample , upon application of @xmath23 , the spin orientation distribution goes from a somewhat arbitrary array of directions to being composed of only two directions , parallel and antiparallel .",
    "the parallel orientation is the lower energy state , and thereby is the more populous state for protons in the sample .",
    "the population distribution is temperature dependent , such that the proportion of protons in the higher energy state increases with temperature .",
    "the relationship is given by ,    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the higher energy state , @xmath29 is the lower energy state , @xmath30 is the energy difference between the two states , @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , and t is the absolute temperature in kelvin .",
    "the bulk magnetization can be modeled as ,    @xmath32    with @xmath33 , it follows that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "the equilibrium magnetization is entirely along the @xmath36 ( longitudinal ) direction and there is no component in the @xmath37 ( transverse ) direction .",
    "the torque on a magnetic moment in a magnetic field acts to align it with the field , is a function of the magnetic potential energy , and is given by ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the angle between @xmath40 and @xmath6 , and the minus sign indicates the restoring nature of the torque .",
    "the force on a nucleon or electron in a magnetic field is ,    @xmath41      when an external magnetic field @xmath23 is applied to an electron or neutron particle , the particle s magnetic moment precesses about the direction of @xmath23at a frequency called the larmor frequency given by ,    @xmath42    in the equilibrium magnetization state with @xmath33 and @xmath35 , there is no precession of the bulk magnetization @xmath3 because @xmath43 .    considering only the spin of a spin 1/2 object in a magnetic field , and assuming @xmath44",
    ", we get the following hamiltonian ,    @xmath45    where the subscript @xmath46 denotes either @xmath11 for electron or @xmath47 for a neutron , and where ,    @xmath48    it follows that ,    @xmath49    we see that remarkably , the hamiltonian is proportional to the z - component of spin , therefore the magnetic spin eigenstates are simultaneously energy eigenstates .",
    "furthermore the energy eigenvalues are proportional to the magnetic spin quantum numbers .",
    "specifically ,    @xmath50    the above relation led early researchers to the discovery of spin , by its manifestation as the zeeman effect and the splitting of energy levels in the hydrogen optical spectrum .",
    "given a bulk magnetization @xmath3 due to a static magnetic field @xmath51 , a pulse of a weaker magnetic field , @xmath5 , oscillating at the larmor frequency and applied perpendicular to @xmath23 , will result in a transition of the individual nucleons from dephased to in - phase oscillation .",
    "this manifests as the acquisition of a transverse phase @xmath52 and oscillations of @xmath3 about the z - axis at the larmor frequency @xmath53 .",
    "this `` tilting '' of the magnetization vector also implies a decrease in @xmath54 . during the pulse ,",
    "the net external magnetic field is the sum of @xmath23 and @xmath5 .",
    "if the pulse duration was extended indefinitely , the result would be alignment of the bulk magnetization with the new direction , @xmath55 , and there would be no resultant oscillation observed .",
    "the pulsed nature of @xmath5 is therefore critical to the technology of magnetic resonance imaging .",
    "the net magnetization is given by ,    @xmath56    while the ratio of @xmath57 to @xmath58 is given in equation  ( [ boltz ] ) above as , @xmath59 .",
    "at equilibrium , the solution of the above system of two equations yields the equilibrium magnetization ,    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the reduced boltzmann constant and @xmath62 is the proton density .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation , also known as @xmath63 relaxation or longitudinal relaxation , is the process of longitudinal magnetization recovery following a @xmath5 perturbation .",
    "specifically , @xmath63 is the time constant of longitudinal magnetization recovery , and is given by ,    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is equilibrium magnetization and @xmath66 is the longitudinal magnetization instantaneously after pulse excitation . in inversion recovery ,",
    "the initial magnetization is negative , and typically @xmath67 .",
    "substituting this value into equation  ( [ eqn : t2 ] ) above yields ,    @xmath68    fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( flair ) is useful in the diagnosis of certain pathologies such as periventricular white - matter lesion in multiple sclerosis .",
    "flair can be t1 or t2 weighted .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : sag_t1_flair ] ) shows a sagittal section of a t1 flair brain image , and figure  ( [ fig : t2_flair_b ] ) shows a t2 flair brain image .",
    "the spin - spin relaxation , also known as @xmath69 relaxation or transverse relaxation , is the process of transverse magnetization relaxation following a @xmath5 perturbation .",
    "specifically , @xmath69 is the time constant of transverse magnetization recovery , and is given by ,    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the transverse magnetization instantaneously after pulse excitation . following the @xmath72 induction of in - phase precession ,",
    "the proton spins again begin to dephase according to @xmath69 time constant . of note ,",
    "the relaxation of transverse magnetization is faster than the recovery of longitudinal magnetization . in other terms , @xmath73 .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : t2axfse ] ) shows a t2 fast spin echo image of acute ischemic stroke in the posterior circulation .      upon pulse excitation and tilting",
    ", the magnetization vector oscillates about the z - axis .",
    "this oscillating magnetic moment in turn generates an electromotive force in accordance with faraday - maxwell law of electromagnetic induction ,    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the curl operator , @xmath76 is the electric field , and @xmath77 is the magnetic field .",
    "the above equation can be rendered in integral form via stokes theorem to yield ,    @xmath78    where @xmath79 can represent a wire coil bounding a surface @xmath80 , @xmath81 is an infinitesimal segment length along the wire , and @xmath82 is vector normal to an infinitesimal area of @xmath80 .",
    "such integral transformation has certain advantages in numerical computation .",
    "for instance , green s functions approaches can be invoked and can greatly decrease the number of unknowns , thereby decreasing the computational resource demand of the problem .",
    "the radio frequency ( rf ) coils within the mri probe experience an electromotive force due to the rotating magnetization .",
    "this results in an electric current signal which is fed as output to a screen .",
    "the signal decays with time according to the @xmath69 time constant , hence the name free inductance decay ( fid ) signal  @xcite .",
    "the bloch equations describe the time evolution of the bulk magnetization vector , and are therefore also referred to as the equations of motion of magnetization .",
    "they are given by ,    @xmath83    @xmath84    and @xmath85    where @xmath8 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleon and @xmath86      there are several contrast agents in current clinical use , most of which are based either on low molecular weight chelates of gadolinium ion ( gd@xmath87 )  @xcite such as gadolinium - dpta , or are based on iron oxide ( feo ) such as fe@xmath88o@xmath89 , fe@xmath2o@xmath88 , and @xmath8-fe@xmath2o@xmath88 ( or gamma phase maghemite )  @xcite . based on their magnetic properties ,",
    "they confer contrast of vasculature from background , and by proxy of vascularization density , of organs from surround . specifically , the gd@xmath87-based",
    "agents predominantly shorten @xmath63 time , while the feo - based agents predominantly shorten @xmath69 time .",
    "nanoparticle formulations of contrast agents are in various stages of development and can be based on gadolinium or iron - oxide , or on other agents such as cobalt , nickel , manganese , or copper ions  @xcite .",
    "optimization of the efficacy of mr contrast agents is an active area of research  @xcite .",
    "the growing array of mr contrast applications has included efforts to target tissue or tumor - specific receptors  @xcite .",
    "serious adverse reactions to intravenous mri contrast agents are rare .",
    "however in the mid 2000s gadolinium chelates were increasingly hypothesized as playing a role in nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( nsf ) , a disease entity unknown prior to 1997 .",
    "it has since been essentially established that gadodiamide , a gadolinium - containing agent , is associated with an increased risk of developing nsf in susceptible individuals  @xcite .",
    "superparamagnetic iron oxides have been promoted by some as possible alternatives to gadolinium - based agents in patients at risk for nsf  @xcite .      for 3d localization ,",
    "a gradient coil generates a magnetic field gradient in the bore .",
    "then in accordance with the larmor frequency relation @xmath90 , it follows that the resonance frequency , @xmath91 acquires space dependence , and thereby serves to effectively label the tissue in space . the process of space - specific excitation of the sample is called _",
    "slice selection_. the excitation pulse frequency is simply chosen as a bandwidth frequency flanking the region - of - interest or the _ slice_. the process of _ scanning _ is an iteration , however simple or complex , through a sequence of slices . and slice thickness is proportional to excitation pulse bandwidth",
    ". the slice thickness can be decreased by decreasing the bandwidth , or alternatively by increasing the magnetic field gradient .",
    "for instance , given a constant magnetic field gradient , the slice thickness between two points @xmath92 and @xmath93 is given by ,    @xmath94 } = r_2 - r_1\\ ] ]    both the bandwidth and magnetic field gradient are graphical user interface ( gui)- adjustable parameters on current day mri machines .",
    "this gradient - based localization technique was paul lauterbur s contribution to the development of mri  @xcite .",
    "the mri is a simple machine in principle .",
    "it was was invented by raymond v. damadian by 1971  @xcite .",
    "it consists of a magnet , a radio frequency coil , an empty space or bore , and a computer processor .",
    "the magnet is for applying the static and pulsed magnetic fields .",
    "current day machines typically use superconducting electromagnets .",
    "these are wire coils cooled to low temperatures using liquid helium and liquid nitrogen  @xcite , allowing for greatly decreased electrical resistance , and consequently high current loops generating strong magnetic fields .",
    "the rf coil typically serves both as the generator of the pulsed magnetic field , and as the detector of the fid signal .",
    "such duality of function is possible simply because the maxwell - faraday equation is true in both directions .",
    "several machines also have a separate gradient coil .",
    "the gradient coil has @xmath46 , @xmath95 , and @xmath36 components indicating the spatial direction of the gradient field , and together conferring 3d localization .",
    "the computer processor runs the software instructions for pulse sequences and signals processing , including image reconstruction .",
    "mri requires strong magnetic fields .",
    "though the earth s magnetic field is variable with time and is asymmetric between northern and southern hemispheres  @xcite , it is estimated to range between 25,000 and 65,000 nanoteslas ( 0.25 to 0.65 gauss ) at the surface , with a commonly cited average of 46,000 nanotesla ( 0.46 gauss )  @xcite .",
    "current clinical use mris commonly range from 1.5 tesla to 7 teslas .",
    "therefore mris may require magnetic fields up to 280,000 times the earth s magnetic field .",
    "this has been achieved by a shift from permanent magnets to superconducting electromagnets , and presents another interdisciplinary link to both theory and practice .",
    "the dominant physical theory of superconductivity is called bcs theory  @xcite after its formulators , bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer , and is based on electron pairing via phonon - exchange to form so called cooper pairs . though electrons are fermions and subject to the fermi exclusion principle , precluding any two electrons occupying the same state , cooper pairs act like bosons because their pairing and spin summation results in integer - spin character , a type of boson - like state . upon cooling , these boson - like pairs can condense , analogous to bose - einstein condensation and representing a quantum phase transition .",
    "quantum phase transitions have historically been challenging to study in a controlled way in the laboratory , but have recently been demonstrated by h. t. mebrahtu et .",
    "al . in tunable quantum tunnelling studies of luttinger liquids  @xcite . in superconductivity ,",
    "upon transition into the condensed state , the coherence of the system imposes a high energy penalty on resistance , effectively resulting in a zero resistance state .",
    "this is formally encoded in the theory by an energy gap at low ( subcritical ) temperatures . in superconducting electromagnets ,",
    "the coil cooling is done through liquid helium and liquid nitrogen and presents a connection to the chemistry of phase transitions , condensed matter and solid state physics , as well as the engineering aspects of attaining and maintaining such low temperatures .",
    "in this section , we review the mri modalities used in the assessment of acute ischemic stroke .      the diffusion - weighted mri ( dwi ) modality exploits the brownian motion of water molecules within a sample , and the relative phase shift in moving water versus stationary water .",
    "the apparent diffusion coefficient ( adc ) is a parameter which can be mapped to provide diagnostic information . in acute ischemic stroke , cytotoxic cellular injury results in axonal edema and a subsequent decrease in brownian motion",
    "this is manifested as a hyperintensity on dwi and a hypointensity on the corresponding adc map .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : dwi_2 ] ) is a dwi showing hyperintensity in the left mca and pca distributions , consistent with acute ischemic stroke .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : adc_stroke_1 ] ) is an adc map showing hypointensity in the left mca distribution , consistent with acute ischemic stroke .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : adc_pca_stroke_b ] ) shows an adc map with a left parieto - occipital hypointensity reflecting left posterior circulation acute ischemic stroke . in the subacute setting , the adc may normalize and even increase due likely to ischemia - associated remodeling and loss of structural integrity .",
    "the differential for hyperintensity on dwi includes hemorrhagic stroke , traumatic brain injury , multiple sclerosis , and brain abscesses  @xcite .",
    "dwi has long been shown in animal models to be more efficacious than @xmath69-weighted imaging for the early detection of transient cerebral ischemia  @xcite .",
    "additionally , dwi has been shown to be highly efficacious in the early detection of acute subcortical infarctions  @xcite .",
    "dwi in conjunction with echo - planar imaging has been shown to effectively discriminate between high grade ( high cellularity ) and low grade ( low cellularity ) gliomas  @xcite .",
    "of note , in spite of the relatively high specificity and sensitivity of dwi in the early detection of acute ischemic stroke , there is a small subset of stroke patients who evade dwi detection in spite of clinically evident stroke - like neurological deficits  @xcite .",
    "dwi tractography or diffusion tensor imaging is a form of principal component analysis in which the dominant eigendirection is used to determine the path of an axonal tract in a given voxel .",
    "this method has shown potential for further elucidation of neuronal pathways in the brain .",
    "perfusion - weighted imaging ( pwi ) is an ordinary differential equations compartment model of blood perfusion through organs . an arterial input function ( aif ) is determined as input into the particular chosen model .",
    "the aif is an impulse , and the model is essentially described by an impulse response or green s function .",
    "the computed output are perfusion parameters such as mean transit time , time to peak , cerebral blood flow rate , and cerebral blood volume .",
    "there are various protocols for the perfusion conditions .",
    "for instance the dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging method uses gadolinium contrast to gather local changes in @xmath96 signal in surrounding tissue .",
    "@xmath96 is a type of @xmath69 in which static dephasing effects are not explicitly rf - canceled , therefore dephasing from magnetic field inhomogeneities and susceptibility effects contribute to a tighter fid envelope ( more rapid decay ; @xmath97 ) than is seen in @xmath69 .",
    "other pwi protocols include arterial spin labeling and blood oxygen level dependent labeling . not surprisingly , pwi results vary with the choice of perfusion model and computational method with which it is implemented  @xcite .      both pwi and dwi are efficacious in the early detection of cerebral ischemia and correlate well with various stroke quantitation scales  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the combination of diffusion and perfusion - weighted imaging allows for assessment of the ischemic penumbra , that watershed region at the boundary of infarcted and non - infarcted tissue  @xcite .",
    "it represents tissue which has suffered some degree of ischemia , but remains viable and possibly salvageable by expedient intervention with thrombolytic therapy  @xcite , hypothermia , blood pressure elevation , or other experimental methods under study .",
    "outside the penumbra , thrombosis or autoregulation of circulation shuts down perfusion to infarcted tissue , resulting in a drastic decrease in perfusion .",
    "diffusion is simultaneously decreased due to tissue ischemia , hence no pwi - dwi mismatch occurs . within the penumbra",
    "however , the tissue is hypoperfused , yet since still viable , it has yet to sustain sufficient cytotoxic axonal damage to manifest a significant decrease in diffusion .",
    "the registration of both imaging modalities therefore demonstrates a diffusion - perfusion mismatch at the penumbra . in set - theoretic terms ,",
    "the brain territory @xmath98 with compromised diffusion is a proper subset of the territory @xmath99 with compromised perfusion , and the relative complement of @xmath98 in @xmath99 is called the _ ischemic penumbra _",
    "@xmath100 ,    @xmath101    one caveat to pwi - dwi mismatch assessment is that when done subjectively by the human eye , it can be demonstrably unreliable  @xcite",
    ". hence development of quantitative metrics and learning algorithms are needed in this area .",
    "for instance , generalized linear models have been used and shown promise  @xcite .",
    "magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( mrs ) is being used in attempts to reliably measure the magnetic resonance of metabolites whose concentrations change in the setting of acute ischemic stroke .",
    "lactate ( lac ) levels are well known to increase in ischemia , and is therefore a candidate in development , while n - acetyl aspartate ( naa ) levels have been shown to decrease in acute stroke , and are used in proton spectroscopy studies .",
    "most studies confirming the ischemia - associated elevation in lac and decrease in naa have been done in the setting of hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy in newborns  @xcite .",
    "in addition to lactate , @xmath39-glx and glycine have also been shown to be increased in the asphyxiated neonate  @xcite .",
    "phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy detects changes in the resonance spectrum of energy metabolites , and has also shown prognostic significance in hypoxic - ischemic brain injury  @xcite . in their current form , mrs methods are less sensitive and practical for the assessment of acute ischemic stroke than the other magnetic resonance modalities discussed here .",
    "however , mrs is rapidly finding a place in the routine clinical assessment of hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy in the asphyxiated neonate .",
    "some neonatal intensive care units , for instance , now conduct mrs studies on all neonates below a certain threshold weight .",
    "the blood oxygen level - dependent ( bold ) mri is a magnetic resonance imaging method that derives contrast from the difference in magnetic properties of oxygenated versus deoxygenated blood .",
    "hemoglobin is the molecule which carries oxygen in the blood , and is located in red blood cells .",
    "the oxygen - bound form of hemoglobin is called oxyhemoglobin , while the oxygen - free form is called deoxyhemoglobin .",
    "deoxyhemoglobin is paramagnetic and in the presence of an applied magnetic field assumes a relatively higher magnetic dipole moment than oxyhemoglobin which is a diamagnetic molecule .",
    "deoxygenated blood has a higher concentration of deoxyhemoglobin than oxyhemoglobin , and this difference is reflected in the mri signal .",
    "@xmath96-based bold mri has shown promise in localizing the penumbra in acute ischemic stroke  @xcite .",
    "it is also used in functional mri ( fmri ) , which is based on the principle that active brain areas have higher resource ( e.g. oxygen , glucose ) demands and higher waste output  @xcite . in this context",
    ", bold has been used to study the brain s behavior during sensorimotor recovery following acute ischemic stroke .",
    "specifically , the coupling between bold and electrical neuroactivity has shed some light on the still poorly understood process of spontaneous motor recovery following a stroke  @xcite .",
    "bold mri results can be affected by baseline circulatory status , and therefore in the research setting near - infrared spectroscopy ( nirs ) can be used as a control , or as an alternative modality in the clinic  @xcite .",
    "bold mri has been used in assessing the brain s response to hypercapnia  @xcite .",
    "hypercapnia can cause changes in multiple variables in the brain such as cerebral blood flow , oxygen consumption rate , cerebral blood volume , arterial oxygen concentration , and red blood cell volume fraction .",
    "however , hypercapnia - associated cerebrovascular reactivity has been strongly correlated with arterial spin labeling and other pwi surrogates , suggesting that the brain s reaction to hypercapnia is dominated by changes in cerebral blood flow  @xcite .",
    "mra is a set of magnetic resonance - based techniques for imaging the circulatory system .",
    "figures  ( [ fig : mracowax ] ) and ( [ fig : mralat ] ) show mra images of the circle - of - willis .",
    "mra techniques can be broadly categorized into flow - dependent and flow - independent groups .",
    "the flow - dependent methods derive contrast from the motion of blood in vasculature relative to the static state of surrounding tissue  @xcite .",
    "two currently well - known and used examples of flow dependent methods are : ( i ) phase contrast mra , ( pc mra )  @xcite and ( ii ) time - of - flight mra ( tof mra ) .",
    "the tof mra images can be acquired in either two dimensional ( 2d tof ) or three dimensional ( 3d tof ) formats .",

    "we take a brief look at some of the basics of signals processing below ,      the fourier transform converts a time domain signal to its corresponding frequency domain signal , and is given by ,    @xmath296 = f(\\omega ) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(t ) e^{-i\\omega t}dt,\\ ] ]    while the inverse fourier transform converts a frequency domain signal to its corresponding time domain signal , and is given by ,    @xmath297=f(t ) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(\\omega ) e^{i\\omega t}d\\omega.\\ ] ]    in practice , the discrete versions of the above equations are used instead , and give good results provided that signal data is sampled at an appropriate frequency , the nyquist frequency .",
    "given an mri signal of @xmath298 sample points , @xmath299 $ ] , where @xmath300 , the frequency domain representation is given by the discrete fourier transform ,    @xmath301 = \\sum_{n = 0}^{n-1 } f[n]e^{-i2\\pi\\frac{k}{n } n},\\ ] ]    and the discrete inverse fourier transform is given by ,    @xmath302 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1 }   f[{\\omega}_k]e^{i2\\pi\\frac{k}{n } n}.\\ ] ]    the above fourier formulas readily allow extension to two and three dimensions as well as various other customizations , tailored to suite the particular mri application and data format .      the whittaker- kotelnikov- shannon- raabe- someya- nyquist theorem prescribes a lower bound on the sampling frequency necessary for perfect reconstruction of a band - limited signal .",
    "it states that given a band limited signal @xmath303 whose frequency domain representation is such that @xmath304 for all @xmath305 and some @xmath306 , then by sampling at a rate @xmath307 , the image can be perfectly reconstructed .",
    "the sampling interval is @xmath308 , and the discrete time signal is expressed as @xmath309 $ ] where @xmath171 is an integer .",
    "@xmath310 and is in units of hertz , hence @xmath311 is in seconds .",
    "the perfect reconstruction is given by the whittaker - shannon interpolation formula ,    @xmath312 \\cdot \\mbox{sinc}\\left(\\frac{t - nt}{t}\\right),\\ ] ]    where sinc is the _",
    "normalized sampling function _ given by ,    @xmath313    in practice , low - pass filtering methods can be used to decrease the amplitude of frequency components which exceed the effective bandlimit .",
    "the aliasing problem arises when the sampling rate @xmath314 is less than twice the bandlimit @xmath306 .",
    "the effect of this is that the reconstructed image is an alias of the actual image .",
    "the discrete time fourier transform ( dtft ) of a signal is given by ,    @xmath315e^{-i\\omega n},\\ ] ]    and in the case of an under - sampled mri signal , the dtft matches that of the alias . therefore the reconstructed image is merely an alias .",
    "this phenomenon can be described more formally by invoking the poisson summation formula ,    @xmath316    where the middle term above is the periodic summation . for a bandlimited under - sampled signal ,",
    "increasing the sampling rate to satisfy the nyquist criterion will restore perfect reconstruction .",
    "the convolution theorem facilitates application - specific image processing before or after reconstruction in either k - space or time domain .",
    "the theorem is given by ,    @xmath317    and states that the fourier transform of the convolution of two functions equals the product of the fourier transforms of both functions . where the convolution is defined as ,    @xmath318    100    m.  abramowitz and i.  a. stegun , _ handbook of mathematical functions : with formulas , graphs , and mathematical tables _",
