    "while the radiative cooling time of the icm is longer than the age of the universe in most of the region in a cluster , the exception is the core , which is @xmath1  kpc from the cluster center .",
    "if there is no heating source , the icm in the core cools and a flow toward the cluster center should develop ( a cooling flow ) . however , x - ray observations have denied the existence of massive cooling flows in clusters , which suggests that the cores should be heated by some unknown sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , even if agns can produce enough energy to heat the core , the energy must deliberately be transported to the surrounding icm in the core . for example , conventional mechanical heating such as the dissipation of weak shocks and sound waves often cause thermal instabilities @xcite .",
    "therefore , turbulence may essentially be required to hold the instabilities for such heating mechanisms .",

    "the crs interact and move outwards with the waves .",
    "the @xmath2 work done by the crs effectively heat the icm .",
    "recently , using numerical simulations , we showed that the cr streaming can stably heat the core for a long time ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "the reason of the stability is that the cr pressure is insensitive to changes in the icm and that the density dependence of the heating term is similar to that of radiative cooling .",
    "moreover , crs can prevail in the entire core and the heating is not localized around the source .",
    "the crs may be provided in the core not only by agns but also through pumping by turbulence @xcite .    in this paper",

    "it is to be noted that non - thermal emissions from cr protons accelerated by agns in the cores have been studied by @xcite .",
    "however , they studied cr acceleration associated with a single agn burst with an extremely large energy , and they did not consider the heating of the icm by cr streaming .",

    "this equation is more correct than that we adopted in paper  i ( equation  [ 6 ] in that paper ) , because it is based on wave energy conservation .",

    "although by solving equations presented in ",
    "[ sec : crdist ] we can obtain the profile of the icm and that of the cr pressure @xmath53 required to heat the core effectively ( paper  i ) , we do not have information on the energy spectrum of the crs . thus",
    ", we need to specify the spectrum of the crs to calculate the non - thermal emissions from the crs .",
    "we assume that the central agn drives outgoing shock waves and form cocoons or bubbles inside them . in the following ,",
    "we show a description of their evolution ( position , velocity , mach number as functions of time ) .",
    "the shocks should inject crs with varying efficiencies and spectra . at some moment",
    "this injection will be maximal ( actually , this moment differs for different cr energy ranges ) .",
    "we only consider the efficiency and mach number at this moment and fix these numbers by requesting them to reproduce the observed radio emission for the sake of simplicity , although there would be a more physical approach to calculate the injection evolution and the full injected cr spectrum , assuming the agn energy release , timescale , and initial cocoon radius .",
    "the crs are accumulated in the core through the agn activities . in paper",
    "i , we studied continuous cr injection as a time average , although the supply of the crs may be intermittent .",
    "each activity of the agn is approximated by an instantaneous explosion .",
    "thus , the shock expands in the icm like a supernova remnant in the galaxy , and the shock velocity depends on the energy input from the agn .    in paper",
    "i , we obtained the profiles of the icm density @xmath54 , the temperature @xmath55 , and the magnetic field @xmath56 at a given time .",
    "we approximate the density profile of the icm by a power - law : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the icm density at the inner boundary ( @xmath59  kpc ) . using a shell approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the radius of the shock can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61^{1/(5-\\omega)}\\:,\\ ] ] @xmath62 is the energy released by the agn , and @xmath63 is the time elapsed since the last energy input from the agn .",

    "since we know the profile of the icm temperature @xmath55 , we can construct the profile of the sound velocity @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath68 and @xmath62 are given , the shock radius @xmath69 , velocity @xmath70 , and the time @xmath63 that satisfy equations  ( [ eq : rs ] ) and  ( [ eq : vs ] ) can be specified .    in reality ,",
    "the spectrum of accelerated crs at the shock may change during the expansion of the cocoon .",
    "probably , the spectrum is flat , when the cocoon is young , and the shock velocity and the mach number are large .",
    "then it gradually steepens as the mach number decreases , and cr acceleration ceases when the mach number approaches @xmath71 .",
    "however , we consider a typical mach number @xmath72 around which most crs are accelerated . in other words , we consider a typical spectrum of crs that are accelerated when the injection of crs becomes maximal .",
    "we treat @xmath72 and @xmath62 as parameters . the shock radius , velocity , and age when @xmath73 are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "we also assume that the spectrum of crs that are just accelerated at @xmath77 has a form of @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the cr momentum , @xmath80 is the index , and @xmath81 is the cutoff momentum of the crs .",
    "since we already know cr pressure @xmath53 , the normalization of relation  ( [ eq : ne ] ) is determined by the relation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the proton mass .",
    "the index is given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the compression ratio of the shock @xcite , which is given by @xmath86 since the cooling of cr protons is not effective , the maximum energy of protons corresponding to @xmath81 is determined by the age of the shock and is represented by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the downstream magnetic field at @xmath89 and is given by @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "that is , the background magnetic field @xmath40 is amplified by the compression ratio @xmath85 ( equation  [ [ eq : comp ] ] ) .",
    "although some particles may be accelerated to higher energies when the expansion velocity of the cocoon was larger , their contribution to the overall spectrum is expected to be small .",
    "the crs injected at @xmath77 propagate in the icm with alfvn waves .",
    "although adiabatic cooling may change @xmath91 , it does not change the index @xmath80 in relation  ( [ eq : ne ] ) .",
    "moreover , the results in   [ sec : agnr ] show that the cr spectra must be steep .",
    "thus , the results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , we do not consider the adiabatic cooling for @xmath91 and adopt the relations  ( [ eq : ne ] ) and  ( [ eq : pc ] ) at any radius @xmath14 , although the adiabatic cooling was considered when we calculated @xmath10 in paper  i. since we expect that thermal protons with higher energies are accelerated as crs , we assume that the minimum momentum of the crs is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the sound velocity of the icm at the downstream of the shock at @xmath89 , which is obtained from the rankine - hugoniot relations for given @xmath94 and @xmath72 : @xmath95 in this way we have the cr spectrum at each radius for given @xmath72 and @xmath62 .",
    "for a given cr proton spectrum , we calculate radiation from them .",
    "non - thermal emission originated from cr protons in the central region of clusters have been studied by several groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we adopt the model of @xcite , in which they calculated non - thermal emissions from supernova remnants .",
    "we consider the synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton ( ic ) emissions from secondary electrons created through the decay of charged pions that are generated through proton - proton collisions .",
    "ic emissions are created by electrons that scatter cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "we also consider @xmath96-decay gamma - rays through proton - proton collisions .",
    "we do not consider emissions from primary electrons that are directly accelerated at the shock , because we did not calculate the distribution of the primary electrons in paper  i. because of the short cooling time of electrons , emissions from primary electrons will disappear soon after their acceleration is finished @xcite .",
    "the photon spectra are calculated based on the radiation models of @xcite . for the production of secondary electrons and @xmath96-decay",
    "gamma - ray photons through proton - proton interactions , we use the code provided by @xcite . the spectrum of the secondary electrons are given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the electron energy , @xmath99 is the cooling time of an electron , and @xmath100 is the production rate of the secondary electrons . for the cooling ,",
    "we include synchrotron cooling , ic scattering , bremsstrahlung , and coulomb loss .",
    "since we replaced the equation for the wave energy @xmath52 ( equation  [ 6 ] in paper  i ) with equation  ( [ eq : ua ] ) , we recalculate the distributions of the icm and crs and show them in figures  [ fig : tn_lcr0 ] and  [ fig : pcb_lcr0 ] .",
    "the cluster is initially isothermal with @xmath101 .",

    "this is because @xmath103 rapidly approaches one after @xmath33 increases regardless of the equation we adopted .",
    "the icm temperature outside the core is @xmath104  kev .",
    "the heating by cr streaming and the radiative cooling are well - balanced at @xmath105  gyr .",

    "the slope of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons are the same as that of protons ( @xmath112 ) , if radiative cooling is not effective . however",

    "the model generally reproduces the surface brightness profile observed in the radio band , although we did not intend to reproduce that when we calculated model  lcr0 in paper  i. in that figure , the surface brightness rapidly increases toward the cluster center for the synchrotron radio emissions because of the increase of the magnetic fields toward the cluster center ( @xmath129 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the profile for the ic missions is relatively flat because electrons scatter cmb photons , which are uniformly distributed .",
    "the size of the region with high surface brightness is regulated by radiative cooling , because radiative cooling increases the icm density and makes a cool core .",

    "the surface brightness profiles for this model are shown in figure  [ fig : surf_scr0 ] .",
    "the surface brightness is smaller than that in figure  [ fig : surf_lcr0 ] .",
    "we have studied the non - thermal spectra of cool cores heated by cr streaming .",
    "the results indicate that the mach number of the shock that accelerate crs must be small ( @xmath0 ) to be consistent with radio observations at least for the perseus cluster .",
    "we think that this is reasonable because the temperature and the sound velocity of the icm is large and thus it is difficult for the cocoon shock to have a large mach number .",
    "the small mach number means that the cr spectrum must be steep . in paper",
    "i , we did not specify the injection mechanism of crs .",
    "we emphasize that even if crs are injected by anything other than the cocoon , the spectrum must be steep for the given @xmath10 .",
    "recently , @xcite indicated that the cr streaming velocity may be much larger than the alfvn velocity @xmath137 in the hot icm .",
    "this is because in high-@xmath138 plasma , where @xmath138 is the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy , waves may suffer strong resonant damping by thermal protons . in this case",
    ", the sound velocity @xmath66 may be appropriate as the streaming velocity instead of @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "thus , we simply replace @xmath137 by @xmath66 in equations  ( [ eq : ec ] ) and  ( [ eq : ua ] ) and see what would happen .",
    "figures  [ fig : tn_lcrs ] and  [ fig : pcb_lcrs ] show the profiles of the icm and crs for the parameters of model  lcr0 except for the larger streaming velocity @xmath66 ; we refer to this model as model  lcrs .",
    "the icm is stably heated by the cr streaming even in this model and the evolution of @xmath36 is not much different from that in model lcr0 . compared with figures  [ fig : pcb_lcr0 ] , the fraction of cr pressure is small in the central region because of the larger streaming velocity and the escape of crs .",
    "since the icm temperature is an increase function of radius ( figure  [ fig : tn_lcrs ] ) , the sound velocity or the streaming velocity is also an increasing function .",
    "thus , @xmath139 tends to decrease outward fairly rapidly .",
    "figures  [ fig : lcrs ] and  [ fig : surf_lcrs ] are the same as figures  [ fig : lcr0 ] and  [ fig : surf_lcr0 ] but for model lcrs .",
    "if we assume @xmath110 as is the case of model lcr0 , non - thermal luminosities in model lcrs are smaller than those in model lcr0 , because more crs have escaped from the core with the high icm density .",
    "thus , we increase the mach number and set it to be @xmath140 .",
    "we present the spectra and surface brightness in figures  [ fig : lcrs ] and  [ fig : surf_lcrs ] .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum and the surface brightness are consistent with the observations .",
    "regardless of the streaming velocity , the cr spectra in the cores must be steep , because if not , the luminosities are too large ( figure  [ fig : lcr0_2]b ) ; this is inconsistent with the small number of clusters in which radio mini - halos have been observed @xcite and the non - detection of gamma - rays from clusters . because of the steep spectra , future observations in the low - frequency radio band would be useful .",
    "thus , cool cores would be promising targets for radio telescopes such as _ lofar_. the number of mini - halos may increase as the sensitivities of radio telescopes are improved . in our model , we assumed that crs are mostly accelerated when the mach number of the shock is @xmath141 .",
    "for real clusters , however , we expect that the mach number @xmath68 decreases and that the cr spectrum at the shock steepens during the expansion of a cocoon .",
    "thus , we expect that the spectral index should increase outwards in the cluster , which has actually been observed in the radio band @xcite , although the interferometric nature of these measurements might result in smaller radio halos at higher frequencies ( missing zero spacing problem ) . on the other hand , observations in other bands would be difficult in the near future ( figures  [ fig : lcr0 ] and  [ fig : scr0 ] ) . in the x - ray band , ic emissions",
    "should be observed ( figures  [ fig : lcr0 ] and  [ fig : scr0 ] ) .",
    "however , thermal emissions from cool cores are very bright , which makes it difficult for the non - thermal emission to be detected . for the perseus cluster , @xcite claimed the detection of non - thermal emission with a flux of @xmath142 between 2 and 10  kev .",
    "however , the detection was not confirmed by later observations @xcite .",
    "even with hard x - ray telescopes that will be launched in the near future such as _ nustar _ and _ astro - h _ , the detection may be difficult because of the low surface brightness ( figures  [ fig : surf_lcr0 ] and  [ fig : surf_scr0 ] ) .",
    "for the detection in the gamma - ray band , good angular resolutions as well as sensitivities are required , because gamma - rays could also be emitted from the central agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which must be resolved .",
    "the steep cr spectra mean that most of the crs in cool cores have low energies .",
    "thus , indirect studies may be useful .",
    "for example , optical filaments observed in cool cores may be heated by those crs ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the cr heating is locally unstable , and that the filaments could be created through local thermal instabilities ( paper  i ) .",
    "moreover , our model does not require turbulence for stable heating .",
    "thus , cool cores in which turbulence is not developing may be observed with detectors having high spectral resolutions such as _ astro - h _ , while the detection of turbulence does not deny our model .",
    "although we did not consider primary electrons , they may be accelerated at shocks in cores in spite of the low mach numbers @xcite , and the emissions from them may be observed in some clusters .",
    "finally , we caution the reader that we did not consider energy - dependent diffusion of crs , because we do not know the actual diffusion coefficient in the icm , especially away from the shock front ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if crs with higher energies escape from the core faster than those with lower energies , the energy spectrum could be steep ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , we did not include the contribution of gamma - rays from crs accelerated at cosmological shocks and those from dark - matters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have investigated non - thermal emissions from cool cores heated by crs . for the distributions of crs",
    ", we used the model in which the cores are stably heated by cr streaming .",
    "cr protons interact with icm protons and produce secondary electrons and @xmath96-decay gamma - rays .",
    "we found that the cr spectra must be steep in order to be consistent with observations of a radio mini - halo .",
    "the steep spectra reflect the fact that the crs are accelerated at shocks with low mach numbers ( @xmath0 ) in hot icm .",
    "we have also studied the dependence on the cr streaming velocity and found that the stronger shocks are required to be consistent with the observations for the larger cr streaming velocity .",
    "since most of the crs in cores have low energies , synchrotron emissions from them should be observed in low - frequency radio bands .",

    "<S> comparison between the theoretical predictions and radio observations shows that the overall cr spectra must be steep , and most of the crs in the cores are low - energy crs . assuming that the crs are injected through agn activities , we study the nature of the shocks that are responsible for the cr acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the steep cr spectra are likely to reflect the fact that the shocks travel in hot icm with fairly small much numbers . </S>",

    "<S> the results indicate that synchrotron emissions from secondary electrons should be observed as radio mini - halos in the cores . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , low - frequency observations ( e.g. _ lofar _ ) are promising . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the steepness of the spectra makes it difficult to detect non - thermal x - ray and gamma - ray emissions from the cores . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy crs may be heating optical filaments observed in the cores . </S>"
