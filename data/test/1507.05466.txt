    "seeing a quantum effect , and even making practical use of it , does not necessarily imply recognising it as such .",
    "magnetic compasses have been around for millenia , but quantum nature of ferromagnetism could not be understood till the discovery of the electron spin and the pauli principle .",
    "more than forty years elapsed between stewart s and kirchhoff s experiments with thermal radiation and planck s dissertation .",
    "already in the 20th century , it took three years for einstein to come up with a quantum explanation of lenard s experiments .",
    "clearly there must exist certain _ mathematical patterns _ in quantum equations of motion allowing one to look at the quantum without recognising it .",
    "an immediate reservation is in place here .",
    "this paper concerns , and is limited to , phase - space formulation of quantum electrodynamics based on the time - normal operator ordering @xcite .",
    "this is only one example in the multitude of analogies existing between the quantum and classical mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our work should be kept distinct from attempts to modify quantum electrodynamics  by making arbitrary physically motivated assumptions about properties of matter ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as from attempts to imitate quantum behaviour in classical stochastic electrodynamics  ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "another well established tradition is applying methods of quantum field theory  to classical statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "worth mentioning are also attempts to implement classical mechanics in the hilbert space , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the result of this paper in a nutshell is that _ quantum electrodynamics  and classical stochastic electrodynamics  share their macroscopic dynamical structure . _ more specifically , all relations for generalised phase - space quasi - distributions @xcite we obtain in this paper lack planck s constant and , _ ipso facto _ , coincide with the corresponding relations of the classical stochastic electrodynamics  for probability distributions .",
    "this lack of planck s constant is exactly the aforementioned mathematical pattern .",
    "one way of formulating our results is that truly quantum dynamics is limited to microscopic conditions of indistinguishability and/or equations of motion of matter",
    ".    for purposes of this paper , _ macroscopic _ refers to electromagnetic interactions under conditions of distinguishability .",
    "etymologies aside , we associate `` macroscopic '' and `` microscopic '' with `` distinguishable '' and `` indistinguishable '' , and not with `` large '' and `` small '' .",
    "`` distinguishability '' has its standard meaning ( formalised as commutativity of relevant dynamical variables in the interaction picture ) . on the commonly used term _ mesoscopic _",
    "see endnote @xcite ; we treat macroscopic and mesoscopic as synonyms .",
    "the logic of the paper revolves around two concepts : `` obscured macroscopic view '' and `` doing quantum electrodynamics  while thinking classically '' .",
    "the former refers to a closed  albeit , strictly speaking , phenomenological ",
    "quantum dynamical framework confined to the electromagnetic  field and current operators .",
    "the latter expresses the critical property of such framework : on rewriting it in the so - called _ response picture _ @xcite , planck s constant drops out .",
    "this is another manifestation of the said mathematical pattern .",
    "any relation within `` obscured macroscopic view '' may therefore be obtained by formal quantisation of its classical counterpart .",
    "we stress that `` obscured macroscopic view '' is not an approximation , nor is it a modification of conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "it is a _ voluntary limit _ we impose on information extracted from a microscopic theory . it does not impose any restrictions on the theory itself , except that it be consistent with conventional quantum electrodynamics .",
    "implications of these results , with a multitude of specifications and reservations , are discussed at length in the paper . here",
    "we allow ourselves only a brief comment so as to clarify our motivation .",
    "particulars aside , quantum measurement is interaction of classical apparata with a quantum system .",
    "nice as it may sound , this definition has two obvious problems .",
    "classical apparata in the strict meaning of the term do not exist in nature , and it is not at all clear which laws  quantum or classical  should govern such interaction .",
    "both problems disappear if we limit `` measurement '' to electromagnetic interaction  of an observer  e.g . , a human being  with the rest of the world .",
    "`` obscured macroscopic view '' is a formal expression of limitations of such `` electromagnetic  observer '' .",
    "the difference between the classical and the quantum for such observer is _ only _ in whether currents he / she sees may or may not be _ phenomenologically _ interpteted as stochastic c - numbers .",
    "if such interpretation happens to be possible for some macroscopic quantum system , the latter becomes phenomenologically indistinguishable from a classical system .",
    "we term such systems classically behaving .",
    "`` classical apparata '' are classically behaving quantum systems , i.e. , _ inherently quantum _ systems which _ appear classical _ to the observer .",
    "their interaction with other quantum systems is governed by laws of quantum electrodynamics , which in this case are structurally identical with classical electrodynamics .",
    "if all devices involved behave classically , the whole situation reverts to classical electrodynamics . in particular",
    ", the classical world we perceive in everyday life is a collection of classically behaving quantum systems .",
    "as we demonstrate in this paper , these leading considerations are fully justified by the formal structure of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we extend the earlier analyses @xcite to distinguishable matter subsystems . we show that the _ formal _ response characterisation of a solitary electromagnetic  device @xcite becomes its _ physical _ characterisation as a radiation scatterer were this device interacting electromagneticaly with other macroscopic devices .",
    "this proves overall physical consistency of the response viewpoint .",
    "secondly , we establish the connection between our approach and the conventional phase - space techniques , making all results , the old as well as the new , intuitive .",
    "to this end we reformulate everything in terms of _ conditional p - functionals _",
    "@xcite ; these quantities generalise both _",
    "conditional probability distributions _ of classical stochastics and _ quasiprobability distributions _ of the conventional phase - space techniques , to arbitrary nonlinear non - markovian bosonic quantum systems .",
    "our analyses imply generalisation of the conventional phase - space techniques , firstly , beyond the resonance , or rotating wave , approximation ( rwa ) , and , secondly , to quantum response problems .",
    "coherent states of the harmonic oscillator , which traditionally serve as an entry point to phase - space approaches , were introduced by schrdinger as early as 1926 @xcite . that quantum dynamics of free bosonic systems maps to classical dynamics irrespective of the quantum state was firstly noticed by feynman in his review on path integrals @xcite .",
    "this understanding was instrumental in developing quantum theory of photodetection by glauber @xcite .",
    "glauber s theory was initially formulated for free electromagnetic fields , then extended to interacting fields by kelley and kleiner @xcite . however , de haan @xcite and later bykov and tatarskii @xcite pointed out that kelley - kleiner s results are limited to the rwa . taking them outside",
    "the rwa leads to causality violations ( we associate causality with retardation , cf .",
    "also endnote @xcite ) .",
    "lifting this restriction by amending the glauber - kelley - kleiner  definition is one of the key results of .",
    "the critical generalisation is inclusion of response .",
    "it establishes a link to a host of powerful ideas , notably , to the real - time quantum field theory   , schwinger - perel - keldysh s closed - time - loop  formalism @xcite , and , last but not least , to relativistic quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "( this link was a subject of @xcite . ) from a physical perspective , it allows one to make propagation of quantum signals in space - time the guiding principle of the whole investigation .",
    "in particular , propagation of the electromagnetic field  underlies the aforementioned amendment of the concept of time - normal ordering .",
    "it also reveals the inherent link between operator noncommutativity and response @xcite .",
    "the pivotal formal point of these analyses is that the description of a quantum system in terms of time - normal averages of heisenberg operators conditional on external sources turns out to be equivalent to the closed - time - loop  framework .",
    "this kind of description was termed in @xcite _ response formulation _ of a quantum system ( also _ response picture _ , _ response viewpoint _ , or _",
    "response characterisation _ ) .",
    "the said equivalence was proven in @xcite for interacting bosons and in @xcite for interacting fermions ( see also endnote @xcite ) .",
    "the closed - time - loop  formulation is the most general formal framework known in quantum field theory . _",
    "ipso facto _ , our approach may be seen as an ultimate generalisation of the phase - space techniques in quantum electrodynamics  ( cf .",
    "endnote @xcite ) .",
    "its ability to tackle relativistic problems with renormalisations was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the way the paper is structured reflects our wish to make the results intuitive .",
    "`` obscured macroscopic view '' as a formal viewpoint is mostly relegated to appendices .",
    "in the main body of the paper , we proceed by `` doing quantum electrodynamics  while thinking classically '' .",
    "we start from a brief overview of the results in . in",
    ", we develop the `` classical yardstick '' : a collection of general formulae , describing properties of devices and their interactions in classical stochastic electrodynamics .",
    "quantum mechanics starts in , which summarises formal definitions .",
    "conditional p - functionals are introduced in . the conjecture that classical formulae of are in fact _ exact _ relations for p - functionals is verified in and [ ch:91rj ] . in , we review the formal approach , concentrating on the interplay of the formal viewpoint and approximations .",

    "appendices [ ch:2dc ] and [ ch : phdet ] provide formal support to `` pictorial derivations '' in .",
    "in this paper we concern ourselves with the _ formal structure _ of quantum electrodynamics . rather than attempting to calculate something measurable , we look at restrictions measurable quantities must obey , assuming the only means of accessing the world is the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "moreover , we are only interested in relations which are independent of any particulars of nonelectromagnetic  nature .",
    "this greatly limits the kind of question we are able to ask .",
    "consider for instance electromagnetic  interaction of two devices depicted schematically in .",
    "for the time being , ignore hats and think about the devices as classical electromagnetic  scatterers . in any real problem",
    ", there must exist microscopic dynamical models allowing one to calculate properties of the devices .",
    "these models necessarily rely on information about properties of matter , which is by itself nonelectromagnetic  ( e.g. , the dirac equation in spinor qed , or various models in solid state theory ) . within `` obscured macroscopic view ''",
    ", we are not inquiring about such details .",
    "we assume that properties of individual devices are known ( a ) , and ask how they should be formally combined to determine properties of the pair ( b ) .    this way",
    ", our investigation is to a large extent a highly formalised electronic - engineering viewpoint .",
    "when planning an experiment , an engineer is only interested in properties of a photodiod ( say ) such as frequency range , efficiency , dark count , dead time , saturation limit , and so on . from our perspective , all these are _ response properties _ of the photodiod .",
    "we mention features such as dark count and saturation limit to emphasise that proper formalisation of the engineering viewpoint can not be too simple .",
    "it should include , e.g. , such nastiness as _ nonlinear non - markovian self - noise_. this is the minimal level of theoretical sophistication accommodating for shot noise , dark count , dead time , and saturation .    at the same time , the problem we face is largely pedagogical .",
    "we need a formal framework which would not impose any restrictions on models of devices .",
    "this implies a relatively high level of abstraction .",
    "physically , all we can say about the arrangements in a , b is that ,    * in `` obscured macroscopic view '' , each device is characterised by a c - number random current ; * statistics of this current is dependent ( conditional ) on the incoming field radiated by some external sources and affecting the device ; * when characterising a particular device , the incoming field should be regarded given ; * for each device in the pair , the incoming field is the external field plus radiation of the other device ; * the current characterising the pair is a sum of currents in the devices ; * the field emitted by the pair is a sum of fields emitted by the devices .    in , we take these trivialities in classical electrodynamics  to a high level of formal abstraction . in the following sections , we demonstrate that quantum - electrodynamical relations in the `` obscured macroscopic view '' express nothing but the same set of trivialities .",
    "it is this fact_and not the trivialities themselves_that constitutes the result of this paper .",
    "in this section we construct a `` classical yardstick '' for future quantum analyses . we develop a formal response characterisation of a device in classical stochastic electrodynamics , including the formal solution to the self - action problem ( cf .",

    "we employ an intuitive characterisation of radiation scatterers in terms of probability distributions conditional on external sources , making all our derivations next to trivial .        from the point of view of an `` electromagnetic observer '' ,",

    "these currents are mostly stochastic ( we do not need quantum mechanics  to arrive at this conclusion , experimental evidence is aplenty ) .",

    "below ) . on the other hand , that this classicality is not needed allows one to easily generalise a to _ cascaded systems _ @xcite . secondly , in practice , control of macroscopic electromagnetic  actions and back - actions is very much a matter of engineering .",
    "examples are control of stray currents and fields in electronics and prevention of reflection of light toward laser sources in optics ( to name just two ) .",
    "we take the liberty of starting this section with a somewhat lengthy quotation from w.  lamb s renowned paper on operational approach to quantum mechanics @xcite : + `` a discussion of the interpretation of quantum mechanics on any level beyond [ regarding it a set of rules for calculating physical properties of matter ] almost inevitably becomes rather vague .",
    "the major difficulty involves the concept of measurement .",
    "i have taught graduate courses in quantum mechanics for over 20 years , and for almost all of them have dealt with measurement in the following manner .",
    "on beginning of lectures i told the students , ` you must first learn the rules of calculation in quantum mechanics , and then i will tell you about the theory of measurement and discuss the meaning of the subject . ' my attitude towards such problems has no doubt been influenced by contact with some research in experimental physics in which atomic states are `` manipulated '' by microwave and radiofrequency fields . in discussion of measurement of some dynamical variable of a physical system",
    "i want to know what apparatus is necessary for the task and how to use it , at least in principle . ''",
    "this paper follows lamb s remarks , albeit more in spirit than to the letter . to begin with",
    ", it does not seem to be possible to introduce quantum measurement as a primary concept .",
    "the reason is the indistinguishability of microscopic objects ( elementary particles ) .",
    "it is difficult to imagine how measurement could be discussed if one can not tell the measured system from the measurement apparatus and from the observer .",
    "_ measurement is limited to macroscopic interactions under conditions of distinguishability .",
    "_ quantum measurement as a formal concept may therefore only emerge as an _ approximation _ within a fully developed theory of microscopic interactions``rules of calculation '' first , `` measurement '' second .    furthermore , quantum measurement is much more dependent on fundamental interactions available in nature , and on limitations of the human observer , than it is commonly acknowleged . the only kind of interaction available to human beings without use of auxiliary quantum systems as measurement apparata is the electromagnetic  one .",
    "it is a long - range interaction , which acts at distances where all short - range interactions may be neglected .",
    "the latter remain hidden inside macroscopic devices , being responsible for their observable properties .",
    "it is the chierarchy of characteristic interaction lengths in nature that is ultimately responsible for the very existence of the macroscopic world , as perceived by a human observer .",
    "the critical distinction to be made in a quantum measurement theory is between _ the observed _ and _ the inferred_. no particular macroscopic experiment gives full access to the underlying quantum dynamics ( nor is this access necessary  think of quarks and gluons in quantum optics ) .",
    "one should therefore distinguish the directly _ measured _ mesoscopic quantities , and the microscopic ones , the properties of which may only be _ inferred _ from the experimental data ( we remind that we treat `` mesoscopic '' and `` macroscopic '' as synonyms , cf .",
    "endnote @xcite ) .",
    "we call measurable quantities _ mesoscopic coordinates _ of the quantum system in question .",
    "real macroscopic experiments give access to properties of mesoscopic coordinates , thus allowing one only a fairly obscured and limited view of microscopic quantum dynamics .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that certain properties of mesoscopic coordinates ( notably , those associated with propagation of quantum information in macroscopic experiments ) turn out to be classical no matter what .",
    "given the actual set of fundamental interactions in nature , mesoscopic coordinates of real devices may only be electromagnetic .",
    "however , the idea of separation of the macroscopic and microscopic levels of insight is not confined to quantum mechanics , nor to electrodynamics , nor is it anything new .",
    "it underlies thermodynamics , whether classical or quantum .",
    "it may also be found in any case where some kind of `` coarse - grained '' description is introduced ( e.g. , in hydrodynamics ) .",
    "sometimes our view of a particular quantum system is obscured to the extent that its quantum properties become fully hidden , and what we see looks perfectly classical .",
    "this was exactly the situation before first experimental indications of the underlying quantum world  properties of the black - body radiation and of the photoelectric effect  emerged in the experiment .",
    "we then say that the _ seemingly _ classical entity we are observing is the _ classical doppelganger _ of the quantum system in question . by definition ,",
    "such classicality is limited to properties of mesoscopic coordinates : an electron can not look classical while an electron current can .",
    "a _ classically behaving quantum system _ is a system that has a classical doppelganger ; in other words , it is a system that _ appears _ classical in some experiment .",
    "a system that does not behave classically is said to exhibit quantum behaviour ( _ quantum - behaved systems _ ) .",
    "an immediate word of caution is in place here .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we associate `` macroscopic '' and `` microscopic '' with `` distinguishable '' and `` indistinguishable '' , and not with `` large '' and `` small '' . for example , electrons in an epr pair remain indistinguishable until environmental influences , such as collisions with backgroud gas , destroy their entanglement .",
    "the epr pair must be regarded a microscopic object , irrespective of how large it becomes over its lifetime ( there is more to this than mere terminology , see below ) . on the other hand , in a hydrogen atom ,",
    "the electron and proton are distinguishable unless pair creation needs to be taken into account .",
    "this allows one to go as far in the theory as the leading ( bethe ) contribution to the lamb shift @xcite ( cf .",

    "this example also shows that observable quantum effects have two origins : properties of individual quantum particles and their indistinguishability .    in this paper",

    "`` collision '' is any situation where conditions of distinguishability in a setup vary with time .",
    "collisions of elementary particles are obviously covered by this definition . whether one regards the epr pair `` microscopic '' or `` macroscopic '' depends on whether collisions are explicitly accounted for . for purposes of this paper ,",

    "so , an ideal mirror may be introduced by postulating boundary conditions for maxwell equations , but an attempt to fully explain properties of real mirrors in classical terms is doomed .    as a rule , taking the limit of a classically behaving device  does not recover its classical doppelganger .",
