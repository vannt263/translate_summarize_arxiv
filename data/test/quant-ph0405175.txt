    "a quantum computer , which is promised to be more powerful than the classical computers in solving some intractable problems by employing quantum algorithms , is not completely available yet , even though there are several proposals based on different quantum systems .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite has been known as one of the most viable methods for demonstrating even relatively complicated quantum algorithms@xcite .",
    "however , the status of nmr has not been completely approved compared to the other candidates such as photons and ion traps , in that it treats an ensemble system composed of a large number of molecules .",
    "moreover , the states are mixed rather than quantum pure states .",
    "accordingly , nearly all previous attempts to demonstrate nmr quantum information processing ( qip ) and quantum computations ( qc ) relied on pseudo - initialization@xcite of highly mixed states .",
    "however , with or without employing the pseudo - pure states , mathematical arguments refute the credibility of nmr qip and qc except at very low spin temperatures by verifying separability of the states@xcite .    entanglement is believed to be an essential requirement for quantum non - local algorithms to give enhancement over the classical counterparts@xcite .",
    "for example , superdense coding ( sdc)@xcite enables transfer of two bits of classical information by encoding a single qubit .",
    "this remarkable effect is ascribed to the existence of entanglement in the system . however , in the implementation of the non - local algorithms by means of nmr , there is confusion with regard to the role of entanglement .",
    "nmr sdc has been demonstrated@xcite , as well as other quantum non - local algorithms@xcite , with the separable states with which the non - local algorithms should not work .    in this work ,",
    "we show that with nmr mixed states , even if the states are definitely separable , still there is a considerably high probability to detect signals with appropriate signs which apparently imply transfer of two - bit message even though we encode only one qubit .",
    "the reason for detection of the signals is proved to be because of the large number of molecules being involved in the nmr ensemble state . therefore , a system composed of a huge number of molecules should be necessarily prepared in order to realize the transfer of two bits of information . then , taking account the required number of resources , molecules , it is totally non - sense to claim on the quantum advantage over the classical counterpart .",
    "however , for an exact demonstration of sdc with nmr , in the sense that it can realize enhancement over the classical communication , nuclear spin polarization should be increased above a certain threshold , and this threshold coincides with the mathematical criterion for non - separability of the density matrix .",
    "we also discuss experimental detection of entanglement in terms of the concept of entanglement witness@xcite .",
    "we introduce a new class of entanglement witness , which is based on measurement of nuclear spin magnetizations in a single run experiment .",
    "this approach provides a simple and convenient way of evaluating the existence of entanglement , and is applicable to all possible states encountered in sdc .",
    "although the entanglement witness derived from the conventional approach is also shown to be measurable in a single run experiment , it requires pre - application of somewhat complicated unitary transformation that depends on the state under investigation .",
    "let us consider a pair of nuclear spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 placed in a static magnetic field @xmath2 , and suppose for a moment that the system is initially in a pure state @xmath3@xcite .",
    "then , the procedure of sdc , whose quantum circuit is described in fig.1 , is as follows@xcite .",
    "firstly , the entangling operation is applied on the state of the nuclear spins .",
    "the entangling operation is composed of a hadamard gate ( h ) on the @xmath4 spin and then a controlled - not gate ( @xmath5 ) whose control and target qubits are the @xmath4 and @xmath6 spins , respectively .",
    "the quantum state @xmath7 after the entangling operation is represented as @xmath8 where we have defined @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath10 is known as one of the four bell states@xcite @xmath11 and @xmath12 . now , suppose that the nuclear spin @xmath4 is given to bob and the other nuclear spin to alice .",
    "bob encodes a two - bit classical message @xmath13 by applying the unitary operation @xmath14 on the @xmath4 spin and then sends off the encoded qubit to alice .",
    "the effect of the unitary transformation by bob is to toggle @xmath15 into the other bell state .",
    "that is , @xmath16 then , alice applies the disentangling operation , which is composed of a @xmath5 followed by @xmath17 .",
    "the state @xmath18 after the disentangling operation is @xmath19 where we defined @xmath20 .",
    "finally , she performs measurement of the resultant magnetizations , @xmath21 and @xmath22 and extracts the results as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    if it was possible to execute all the above process in an nmr apparatus , then the signal intensities detected through the measurement in this ideal case of the fully polarized initial state would have been maximum and information on the choice of @xmath25 could be extracted with a success probability of unity . in this case , the maximum entanglement is shared between alice and bob , which causes transfer of two classical bits of information from bob to alice via the @xmath4 spin alone .",
    "communication by sdc is efficient by a factor of two as compared to the classical communication .",
    "nmr @xcite is a spectroscopy , manipulating the nuclear spins placed in a strong , typically 10 tesla , static magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding total spin hamiltonian in an isotropic liquid state is composed of several terms , but the most important parts are considered as the zeeman hamiltonian and spin - spin interaction parts .",
    "so that we take @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the larmor frequency and @xmath28 is the pauli operator for the @xmath29 component of the @xmath30th spin and @xmath31 is the coupling constant between @xmath30th and @xmath32th spins in a molecule . in the high field approximation , which is valid for most practical cases , in the thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath33 , the polarization @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "accordingly , the probabilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 of finding the @xmath30th spin in the states @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , are given by @xmath41 then , the density matrix in thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the density matrix for the @xmath30th nuclear spin in a molecule and is written as @xmath44 at room temperature , the energy splitting between the ground state and the excited state is much smaller than the thermal energy and as a result , large number of spins ( qubits ) are in statistical mixture with low spin polarization .",
    "accordingly , the information processing should be evaluated statistically .    for nuclear spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 the initial state is a mixed state described by partially polarized density matrix with the form of ( [ ron ] ) and ( [ roi ] ) with @xmath45 as @xmath46 after performing the entangling operation the state of the two qubits ( [ roin ] ) changes to a general bell diagonal state of the form @xmath47 this is the shared state between alice and bob .",
    "suppose that bob owns the state of the nuclear spin @xmath4 .",
    "then , bob applies the unitary operation @xmath48 .",
    "the state @xmath49 , after the encoding operation is still a general bell diagonal state as follows @xmath50 he hands over the nuclear spin to alice , who applies the disentangling operation .",
    "then , the state @xmath49 changes into @xmath51 measurement of the spin magnetizations @xmath52 and @xmath53 is done on the total ensemble state composed of @xmath54 molecules .",
    "then , measurement on the product state @xmath55 is composed of separate but simultaneous measurements , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , on the spin magnetizations .",
    "note , that @xmath58 stands for the density matrix @xmath59 of the @xmath30th molecule .",
    "measurement of the spin magnetizations gives results as binomial probability distributions over @xmath60 , with the mean values to be as follows @xmath61 let us make an assumption that @xmath62 , which does not influence the generality of the discussion .",
    "the corresponding variances are characterized by @xmath63 recall that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are essentially the widths of the range over which the outcomes are distributed around the mean values ( [ mean ] ) .",
    "the relative widths of distributions are characterized by @xmath66 then it is clear that the relative widths decrease as @xmath67 with increasing the number of molecules @xmath54",
    ". thus , the greater the number of molecules , the more likely it is that an observation gives a result which is relatively close to the mean values ( [ mean ] ) .",
    "now , it is also required to calculate the corresponding error probability of detection of a negative value for @xmath68 . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider only @xmath69 , which is the measurement on the spin magnetization of the nuclear spin @xmath4 in the @xmath30th molecule .",
    "it should be clear at the moment that results are applicable to the signals detected through measurement on the other spin magnetization in the molecule , @xmath70 .",
    "the error probability is defined as @xmath71 we would like to calculate the error probability to show that for a range of @xmath54 of the current nmr experiments , this quantity is negligible . from the demoivre and laplace",
    "theorem@xcite if @xmath54 is large enough then generally we have @xmath72 for the error probability @xmath73 , therefore @xmath74 if the number of molecules are large enough , the result of the measurement on the spin magnetizations @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the ensemble state gives results very close to the mean values ( [ mean ] ) with negligible error probabilities . in a conventional nmr experiment ,",
    "the number of molecules are @xmath75 , with low spin polarization @xmath76 .",
    "then we calculate @xmath77 , to be negligible .",
    "therefore , in an nmr apparatus , if signals can be detected despite of the low spin polarization the choice @xmath13 can be evaluated with probability of almost one through the signs of the signals ( [ mean ] ) .",
    "detection of signals depends on the nmr apparatus .",
    "the nmr signal intensity is defined by amplitude @xmath78 and the noise is determined through nyquist formula@xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the quality factor of the resonance coil , @xmath81 is the volume of the coil , @xmath82 is the resistance , @xmath83 is the larmor frequency of the nuclear spin @xmath4 , and @xmath84 is the amplifier bandwidth .",
    "the noise which is defined by ( [ n ] ) is entirely classical noise generated by the equilibrium fluctuations of the electric current inside an electrical conductor .",
    "nevertheless , for an nmr experiment with two qubit liquid ensemble at room temperature with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the number of required molecules is bounded by @xmath87@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case which we are facing , @xmath54 is large to get strong enough signal intensities to be detectable with an nmr apparatus .",
    "deviations are very small ( [ var ] ) and the signals are very close to the mean values ( [ mean ] ) with the error probabilities to be negligible .",
    "thus the signs of the detected signals give information on the choice of @xmath13 , and hence the encoded two - bit message , regardless of the separability due to the very low polarized initial states .",
    "then we emphasize the results of the measurement of the spin magnetizations @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be as follows @xmath88 we note that this does not necessarily mean that the experiment described here is a demonstration of sdc with nmr mixed states , even though the signs of the detected signals appear to give the two - bit message while the @xmath4 spin alone has been applied by encoding pulses .",
    "sdc relies on entanglement of states in order to realize transfer of two - bit information by only encoding a single qubit . in the case of the nmr experiment , as explained here , the large number of molecules are inevitably required for detection of encoded two - bit message .",
    "then taking account the required number of molecules it is in principle erroneous to call the corresponding nmr experiment a demonstration of sdc .",
    "given the density matrix ( [ encoded ] ) , we obtain a probability for a successful sdc to be @xmath89 , with which a two - bit message can be transferred inside any individual single molecule .",
    "therefore , for this experiment to represent the quantum information advantage and to outperform the classical one - bit communication through one - qubit channel , the success probability , @xmath89 , must exceed @xmath90 .",
    "this is because two - bit information can be obtained by one - bit classical communication and a one - bit of random guess , which comes true with a probability of @xmath91 .",
    "then sdc is beyond the classical achievements only if the inequality @xmath92 is satisfied .",
    "it is worth noting that this condition exactly coincides with the condition for the non - separability of @xmath49 derived from e.g. the negativity criterion@xcite .",
    "therefore , only when @xmath93 , to be defined as follows , imposes a negative value , the nmr sdc is successful and there exists entanglement .",
    "@xmath94 detection of entanglement through finding a negative value for an observable is reminiscent of entanglement witness@xcite .",
    "entanglement witness is a hermitian operator @xmath95 which has positive mean values for all separable states @xmath96 , @xmath97 , but a negative mean value for at least one entangled state @xmath98 , @xmath99 . in other words ,",
    "entanglement is detected if a negative mean value is obtained through the measurement of the entanglement witness .    using the spin polarizations , we rewrite @xmath93 as @xmath100 where we used ( [ result ] ) .",
    "the absolute values are required for the evaluation of the function @xmath93 for different choices of @xmath101 .",
    "measurement on the state @xmath59 with the observables @xmath21 and @xmath22 is equivalent to measurement on the state @xmath49 ( or @xmath102 in the special case of @xmath103 ) in the bell basis , because @xmath104 @xmath105 where the two observables @xmath106 and @xmath107 are defined as follows @xmath108 @xmath109 from ( [ 20 ] ) , ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) , then @xmath93 is further rewritten as @xmath110 measurement of the two observables @xmath106 and @xmath107 on the ensemble system described by @xmath49 is related to the measurement on the state @xmath59 of the spin magnetization , which affords information on the spin polarizations .",
    "therefore , separate and simultaneous measurement of the observables @xmath106 and @xmath107 is possible in a single experiment , and tells the existence of entanglement .",
    "that is , if @xmath111 and @xmath112 satisfy @xmath113 then the state is entangled . in this sense , @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    "are regarded as a new class of entanglement witnesses .",
    "these observables are easily measurable in a single run nmr experiment and give information on the status of entanglement through quantitative evaluation of the function @xmath93 ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "we also note , that entanglement can be detected in principle through measuring the conventional entanglement witness@xcite . for @xmath49 ,",
    "entanglement witness is derived by the conventional approach@xcite as @xmath114 if we assume the ability of implementation of any form of the unitary transformations with nmr pulse sequences , then the conventional entanglement witness also can be measured in a single run experiment and by measuring the spin magnetizations ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we emphasize here , that the scheme which is introduced in this contribution for detection of entanglement , still has advantage in the sense that for different choices of @xmath115 and @xmath116 it is applicable by just evaluation the function with the absolute values . in other words , there is no need to change the experimental operations .",
    "however , the conventional entanglement witness even though is proved here to be measurable in a single run nmr experiment by only measuring the spin magnetizations , still requires different pre - applied unitary transformations , which depend on the choices of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "liquid state nmr with very low nuclear spin polarizations prohibits the existence of entanglement . then , with this physical system , it is absolutely impossible to demonstrate a faithful non - local quantum information processing , which requires entangled states .",
    "although two - bit information is correctly detected in nmr sdc experiment , it is not based on the existence of entanglement but relys on the large number of molecules .    for a completely reliable demonstration of nmr sdc within a single molecule , spin polarization",
    "should inevitably be enhanced over a certain threshold and this threshold coincides with the condition for non - separability of the states . according to the results , we introduced a new class of entanglement witnesses , with several advantages particularly for nmr .",
    "the introduced entanglement witness is measurable in a single run experiment and generally is applicable for all the states without any requirement on any extra experimental operation .",
    "detection of entanglement through the conventional entanglement witness is also proved to be possible in a single nmr experiment , however for different states under investigation , it requires different pre - application of somehow complicated unitary transformations .",
    "r. r. and m. k. are grateful for helpful discussions with dr .",
    "fumiaki morikoshi .",
    "r.r . would like to thank akira saitoh for contributions to the appendix a. this work has been supported by crest of japan science and technology agency .",
    "suppose that we have the observable @xmath117 with coefficients @xmath118 and a unitary transformation @xmath119 , and have the conventional entanglement witness ( [ 32 ] ) . for @xmath13 , which is fixed to each of the possible four classes , we would like to prove with an explicite example that there exists a set of @xmath120 , and @xmath121 such that @xmath122 .    in the following ,",
    "we first restrict the problem to the case of @xmath123 then will discuss on the other cases .",
    "the entanglement witness @xmath124 for @xmath125 is@xcite @xmath126 the eigenvalues of @xmath124 are different to the ones for @xmath127",
    ". then the two observables are essentially different to each other",
    ". however they can still give the same value after calculating the traces .",
    "consider the case where @xmath128 , a maximally mixed state @xmath129 for the input .",
    "we have @xmath130 therefore @xmath131 holds .",
    "an equivalent problem , then would be finding a set of @xmath132 and @xmath133 that satisfies @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 . because @xmath102 is a diagonal matrix , the above equality holds for @xmath137 if the diagonal elements of @xmath138 are zero .",
    "this condition is expressed as follows @xmath139 this leads to that @xmath140 this is an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the hermitian matrix @xmath141 has the eigenvalues @xmath142 .",
    "then we should solve the following system of equations for @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath144 where @xmath145 , otherwise @xmath146 .",
    "as far as we only want to show the possibility of the measurement of the conventional entanglement witness by only measuring the spin polarizations in a single run nmr experiment , it is enough to give an example and to avoid the unnecessary complexities due to a general proof .",
    "suppose that the state to be measured is a maximally entangled state .",
    "measurement with the conventional witness observable @xmath124 gives @xmath147 .",
    "we impose the observable @xmath127 to give the same value .",
    "we observe that for the maximally entangled state , @xmath21 and @xmath22 should take @xmath148 .",
    "recall that generally @xmath131 . then , as an example , we can choose @xmath149 and the corresponding unitary transformation is obtained as follows @xmath150 for different choices of @xmath101 , the elements of the matrix @xmath141 should be changed in a way that the unsimilar diagonal element @xmath151 stands for the matrix component @xmath152 .",
    "then similar calculation shows that the components of @xmath153 for different choices of @xmath101 interchange according to each case .",
    "therefore , we showed that it is also possible to decompose the conventional entanglement witness to the separate but simultaneous measurement on the spin magnetizations .",
    "however , we emphasize that still the entanglement witness , which we introduced in this work is more handy as it covers all the cases for different @xmath115 and @xmath116 , by just evaluation of the function @xmath93 with the absolute values without additional requirements on the different experimental operations .",
    "whereas , as far as the conventional entanglement witness is concerned , different sets of @xmath154 , @xmath155 and more over different unitary transformations are required for different choices of @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in other words , by only changing the signs of the absolute values @xmath154 and @xmath155 but with a fixed unitary transformation , generally it is impossible to get the equality for the expectation values of @xmath124 and @xmath127 .",
    "this can be proved by contradiction .",
    "suppose that it would be possible to have the equality with a fixed unitary transformation but just changing the signs of the absolute values .",
    "then the equality ( [ a ] ) should also be satisfied with a fixed @xmath156 but different signs for @xmath157 and @xmath158 . recall that the diagonal elements of @xmath141 have to interchange in accordance with the values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "all of them if applied to the system of equations ( [ last ] ) result in some contradiction .",
    "particularly two resultant equations from the system of equations for different @xmath115 and @xmath116 are as follows @xmath159 @xmath160 where ( [ first ] ) is for the case @xmath161 and @xmath162 but ( [ second ] ) is for the case @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the clear contradiction between ( [ first ] ) and ( [ second ] ) leads to the result that the original assumption can not be true .",
    "we conclude as follows .",
    "the conventional entanglement witness is measurable in a single nmr experiment and by only measuring the spin magnetizations , provided that any required unitary transformation can be applied prior to the measurement .",
    "however , the unitary transformation has to be changed in accordance to the choices of @xmath115 and @xmath116 and in this sense the new entanglement witness , which we introduced in this contribution is proved to have its favorite advantage ."
