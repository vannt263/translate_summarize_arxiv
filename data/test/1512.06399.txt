    "one of the important elements of this analogy is design of quantum gates @xcite , which , in many cases , can be understood in terms of classical gate procedures applied to binary - labeled basis states .",

    "the physics of performing entangling quantum gates involves driving the system through such auxiliary interacting state to accumulate a non - local phase .    in our recent work @xcite it was suggested that quantum gates can use physical interactions @xcite between systems that represent qubits more effectively if classical driving is replaced by temporarily - enabled continuous time quantum walks @xcite .",
    "this approach gives multi - qubit multi - state systems freedom to explore multiple quantum states involved in interaction , hence , potentially enabling more effective phase accumulation . in the present paper",

    "quantum computing is based on the principle that qubit amplitudes remain hidden ( unknown ) during the evolution ( gates ) . as the result ,",

    "note that when rotating wave approximation is not appropriate , @xmath0 can still be defined , but it will become a function of time as well @xcite .    to ensure conservation of probability within boolean ( qubit ) domain",
    "we must restrict ourselves only to a sub - set of graphs that satisfy @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in the trivial case when @xmath41 the walk",
    "never leaves the boolean domain ( qubit subspace ) .",
    "another important subgroup of graphs that satisfy [ eq : qw : qlp ] are graphs that enable `` _ return _ '' quantum walks  walks that return the population back to the initial state with probability 1 at some finite time @xmath38 . in what follows we investigate graphs with @xmath42 that satisfy ( [ eq : qw : qlp ] ) .",
    "particular emphasis is made on two types of _ return _ quantum walks : ( i ) walks that accumulate no phase when the population is returned to the original state ( trivial return walks ) , and ( ii ) walks that accumulate a phase of @xmath43 when return to the initial state ( non - trivial return walks ) .",
    "the simplest example of such walks is evolution of a driven two state quantum system @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss structure of @xmath0 necessary to implement entangling and local ( single - qubit ) quantum gates and give several examples of such implementations . in the systems introduced in sec .",

    "because these hopping amplitudes represent strengths of fourier harmonics of external control field , they are adjustable parameters of the problem and can be chosen to perform the desired quantum walks and , ultimately , quantum gate .",
    "not all of these amplitudes , however , are independent .    when multi - state systems that hold qubits are well isolated from one another , the set of rabi frequencies describing transitions in the system obeys strict symmetry relations .",
    "all graph node states @xmath47 are product states , and external control field can rotate each individual isolated multi - state system independently of the state of other such systems .",
    "this means that @xmath48 where all rabi frequencies @xmath49 in each row correspond to the same physical harmonic of the external control field .",
    "this symmetry can be partially or completely lifted when there are physical interactions between parts of the system that encode different qubits , i.e. , graph vertex states @xmath50 are no longer separable ( factorisable ) for some or any @xmath51 .",
    "note , however , that even in the case of strong interaction between qubit systems , groups of indistinguishable @xmath49 edges may still exist if the spectrum of ( [ eq : qw : h ] ) has degenerate transitions .",
    "in addition , degeneracy in graph edges ( values of @xmath49 ) can be artificially introduced , even if not present originally , by choosing appropriate envelop of the external control pulse .    in what follows",
    "we will focus on one specific case of lifting non - interacting symmetry ( [ eq : qb :",
    "ni - omega ] ) , which is based on `` intermediate resonance regime '' introduced in our earlier work for several different qubit designs @xcite .",
    "the intermediate resonance regime assumes that all qubits are physically interacting with each other via transitions to higher energy auxiliary states . in order to provide the simplest illustration , we take @xmath52 as such state and allow only one transition @xmath53 in each qubit system . in this specific case , symmetry ( [ eq : qb : ni - omega ] ) for @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "is lifted when combinations @xmath56 and @xmath57 have non - equal number of indexes referring to states outside of the computational basis .",

    "when degeneracy ( [ eq : qb : ni - omega ] ) is lifted differently , the gates can be constructed in a similar fashion , although different graphs might be necessary in each case .",
    "furthermore , because violation of symmetry ( [ eq : qb : ni - omega ] ) is a manifestation of physical interactions between qubits , some entangling gates might not be accessible in certain cases .",
    "this is not surprising because necessary physical interactions might simply be absent .",
    "single - qubit quantum gates in systems with actively used auxiliary states are the simplest examples of @xmath58 gates implemented via quantum walks .",
    "here we give few examples of gates , some of which are performed routinely in different quantum computing systems @xcite , to demonstrate their connection with a ( more general ) quantum - walks - based approach investigated in this paper .",
    "the first example is @xmath59 gate @xcite .",
    "this gate flips the sign of the amplitude for one of the qubit s state , i.e. , @xmath60 in the simplest case , a single auxiliary state is sufficient and we can choose the graph with the following adjacency matrix @xmath61 in the basis @xmath62 , i.e. transition between states @xmath3 and @xmath52 is addressed ( activated ) by external pulse with rabi frequency @xmath49 . upon examination of the solution of this effectively two - state problem ( see sec  [ sec : lg : ch2 ] ) it is evident that ( [ eq:1qb : uz ] ) is obtained from eqs .",
