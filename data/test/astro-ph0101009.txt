    "the longitudinal / transverse decomposition is not unique ( e.g. one may always add a constant to @xmath42 ) but it always exists . the terminology arises because in the fourier domain @xmath42 is parallel to the wavevector while @xmath43 is transverse ( perpendicular to the wavevector ) .",
    "note that @xmath44 for some scalar field @xmath45 .",

    "a similar decomposition holds for a two - index tensor , but now each index can be either longitudinal or transverse . for a symmetric tensor , there are three possibilities : both indices are longitudinal , one is transverse , or two are transverse .",

    "otherwise there are three differences .",
    "first , the spatial curvature adds a scale to the laplacian in a curved space .",

    "equation ( [ momcon ] ) is reminiscent of the zeldovich approximation [ @xcite ] in that the velocity potential is proportional to the gravitational potential in the linear regime when @xmath88 .",
    "however , it is a more general result whose newtonian limit may be derived by combining the continuity equation with the time derivative of the poisson equation .    equation ( [ phidd ] ) is more surprising , as it gives the gravitational potential through a second - order time evolution equation as opposed to the action - at - a - distance poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) .",

    "indeed , an equation similar to equation ( [ phidd ] ) can be derived in newtonian gravity from the fluid and poisson equations .",
    "its utility arises from the fact that when pressure perturbations are gravitationally unimportant ( i.e. when matter and/or dark energy dominate over radiation ) , the time evolution of perturbations can be obtained from a single differential equation depending only on the background curvature , pressure , and density .      to conclude this section",

    "<S> these lecture notes discuss several topics in the physics of cosmic structure formation starting from the evolution of small - amplitude fluctuations in the radiation - dominated era . </S>",
    "<S> the topics include relativistic cosmological perturbation theory with the scalar - vector - tensor decomposition , the evolution of adiabatic and isocurvature initial fluctuations , microwave background anisotropy , spatial and angular power spectra , the cold dark matter linear transfer function , press - schechter theory , and a brief introduction to numerical simulation methods . </S>"
