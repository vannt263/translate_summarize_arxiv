    "during last years there appears a growing interest in studying of topological structures on curved surfaces . this interest becomes stronger on the one hand due to the interplay between geometry , curvature and physical properties of topological structures . on the other hand , recent developments in nanotechnology makes it possible to produce nanoparticles of various shapes .",
    "for instance , in nanomagnetism , topologically nontrivial structures , magnetic vortices , can form ground states of nanosamples @xcite .",
    "the control vortex statics and dynamics in scales of nanometers and picoseconds is of crucial importance for applications such as magnetic logic and memory concepts @xcite .    during last decade",
    "different aspects of magnetic vortex statics and dynamics were studied ; however , investigations were mainly restricted to flat geometry .",
    "it is well known that the vortex state appears as a ground state in sub ",
    "sized magnets due to competition between short  range exchange interactions and the long  range dipole interactions @xcite . for the smaller samples",
    "the ground state is the monodomain one , which is characterized by the quasiuniform magnetization structure .",
    "the curvature can crucially change the physical picture .",
    "for example , in spherical shell the quasiuniform in  surface state is forbidden for topological reasons ; instead vortex singularities appear .",
    "recently we found that the curvature results in coupling between the localized out  of  surface component of the vortex with its delocalized in  surface structure @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the equilibrium state in soft magnetic permalloy caps on self  assembled spherical particles revealed the vortex ground state for individual caps @xcite and closely packed cap arrays @xcite . depending on the geometrical and magnetic parameters of the caps , there exist different magnetization configurations ( magnetic phases ) in extruded hemispheres : two monodomain phases ( the uniform easy  axis phase and the onion one ) , and the vortex phase @xcite .    in this paper we consider another geometry of the cap , namely a hemispherical shell . by combining analytical methods and micromagnetic simulations",
    "we describe the equilibrium magnetic phases : the monodomain state and the vortex one .",
    "the key moment is to propose a simple analytical approach , which allows us to describe different states and transitions between them .",
    "we will see below that the geometry of hemispherical shell results in a significantly modified phase diagram without a uniform easy  axis state in comparison with extruded hemispheres .",
    "we consider a classical magnetically soft particle , using the continuous description for the magnetization . in term of angular variables ,",
    "the magnetization , normalized by its saturation value @xmath0 has the following form @xmath1 our consideration is limited by two main contributions to the energy functional , the exchange energy @xmath2 and the magnetostatic energy @xmath3 .",
    "we neglect the anisotropy energy contributions , what is a reasonable for the soft materials like permalloy ( @xmath4 , py ) .",

    "exist two monodomain states : the onion state is favoured for small enough aspect ratios , when @xmath40 with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath42 , an easy  axis magnetization distribution is realized .",
    "the reason for the uniform easy  axes state is dictated by geometry : the sample is elongated along z  axis , having the shape of cylinder with spherically deformed face surfaces .",
    "the monodomain magnetization distribution can form the ground state for relatively small samples .",
    "it is well known for flat samples @xcite , that the magnetization curling becomes energetically favorable with the particle size increasing .",
    "the reason is the competition between the exchange and stray field . in particular , for the disk shape particle , there appears a vortex state @xcite .",
    "the static vortex state provides the absence of volume and edge surface magnetostatic charges .",
    "the only small stray field comes from face surface charges , which are localized inside the core .",

    "onion states for the ring geometry were intensively studied during the last decade experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the magnetization configuration in the onion state ring in each half of the ring has an opposite sense of circulation , forming two edge solitons ( boojums ) .",
    "the onion configuration is also known for the spherical shells @xcite .",

    "similar to the previous section we replace the magnetostatic energy of the spherical surfaces by its local counterpart , the easy  surface anisotropy .",
    "this contribution is described by the functional @xmath80 , see . when we described the vortex state it was sufficient to limit ourselves by such approach since the vortex magnetization distribution does not produce neither volume charges nor surface charges on the ring surface .",
    "it is not the case for the onion state .",
    "however , a detailed numerical analysis shows that both volume magnetic charge contribution and the contribution due to the interaction between the spherical surface charges and ring surface charges are negligibly small as compared with @xmath80 .",
    "analysis shows that the essential role in the energy balance plays the magnetostatic energy of the ring surface itself @xmath81 here the source of the energy is the ring surface charges @xmath82 the other parameters are as follows : @xmath83^{1/2}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the same way we incorporate the ansatz into the energy functional . as a result",

    "it is also instructive to compare energies of the uniform state and the vortex one : @xmath91 since the energy of the uniform state is always larger than the onion one , the condition gives the minorant estimation for the boundary between different phases .",

    "[ fig : en ] that our theoretically calculated curves underestimate the energy of the vortex state for @xmath94 .",
    "the reason is that we do not take into account the contributions to the magnetostatic energy by the volume charges , by the interaction between spherical surface charges and the ring surface charge , and by the interaction of volume and surface charges .",

    "the comparison of our theory with simulation data shows that the analytically calculated boundary is located upper than the simulations data .",
    "the reason is that we underestimate the energy of the onion state , see above , that is why our curve majorizes the correct boundary curve for not very small thicknesses , see the blue solid curve in fig .",

    "we also plotted the curve , which results from the energy balance between the uniform state and the vortex one , see , which minorizes the correct boundary .",
