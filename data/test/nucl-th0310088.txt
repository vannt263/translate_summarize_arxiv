    "in 1974 , t hooft described the behavior of the large @xmath1 limit of qcd in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite .",
    "he showed that the model confined quarks and was exactly soluable .",
    "his work was followed quickly by several papers @xcite discussing various aspects of the model .",
    "the work by einhorn @xcite discussed the t hooft model predictions for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "einhorn found that the dis cross section was proportional to the square of the undressed quark masses , and hence would approach zero as the quark masses approach zero .",
    "this pathlogical result made it difficult to apply the t hooft model to the phenomenology of dis ; clearly someting major was missing .",
    "of course , limiting the physics to @xmath0 dimensions also excludes transverse spin degrees of freedom , so @xmath3 was zero and the callan - gross relation @xcite did not hold .",
    "since then qcd in @xmath0 diminsions has been studied from a variety of points of view @xcite and applied recently to the study of duality in heavy meson decays @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no one has followed up on einhorn s study @xcite of dis .",
    "a few years ago we found that a very simple toy model of scalar and spinor fields in @xmath0 dimension gave nice phenomenological results for dis @xcite . by extending the spinor degrees of freedom to 1 + 3 dimensions we were able to recover the callan - gross relation .",
    "we decided to extend our approach to the t hooft model , and learned of the pathology in its description of dis .",
    "it turns out that this pathology can be removed by extending the spinor degrees of freedom to 1 + 3 dimensions , just as we did before , and this paper grew out of that study .",
    "this paper is divided into five sections , with seven appendices that include many of the details . following this brief introduction , sec .",
    "ii reviews the t hooft model results for the strong sector .",
    "our discussion focuses on ( i ) a method of treatment of the confining interaction that removes all singularities from the theory and gives finite dressed quark masses , and ( ii ) the consequence of including transverse degrees of freedom for the spin of the quarks .",
    "we calculate the dressed quark mass , and the properties and spectrum of @xmath4 bound states , and also study the consequences of the completness of the bound states .",
    "we show how to construct an off - shell @xmath4 scattering matrix , and show that the on - shell scattering matrix must be zero , as required for confined particles .",
    "sections iii and iv study electromagnetic interactions and deep inelastic scatterng . here",
    "the presence of transverse spin degrees of freedom completly alters the einhorn discussion , giving us phenomonologically useful results .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion .    in a subsequent paper @xcite we plan to present a numerical study of the approach to scaling in the dis limit .",
    "we propose that the action have the following form @xmath5 where the qcd part of the action ( gluons and quark momenta or coordinates ) live in @xmath0 dimensions only , but the quark spin and the qed part ( leptons and the photon ) live in the full @xmath2 dimensions @xmath6 in his original paper , t hooft @xcite discussed the strong interactions only , and in this section we review the 1 + 1 dimensional model of qcd that he presented .",
