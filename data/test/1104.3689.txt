    "our contribution belongs to the field of discrete projective differential geometry .",
    "but we try to avoid the typical differential or difference equations and instead resort to synthetic reasoning .",
    "it is in the nature of our subject that we merely prove some incidence geometric results .",
    "this may seem like an old fashioned approach to an outdated topic .",
    "it is needless to say that we do not share this opinion , but it seems necessary to support our point of view by a few arguments :    * arguably , the lack of ordering principles is one of the reasons why pure projective geometry is of little interest to today s mathematicians .",
    "in contrast , a highly active research field , discrete differential geometry , has emerged from the desire to find discrete versions of differential geometric theorems @xcite .",
    "we feel that differential geometry can serve as a guideline to single out `` interesting '' results from the wealth of projective incidence theorems . *",
    "our contributions generalize recent results on discrete conjugate nets and discrete asymptotic nets @xcite .",
    "thus , our topic blends in with current research and should not be considered outdated . *",
    "relying on synthetic reasoning is of a particular appeal in the absence of metric structures .",
    "the reason is , that synthetic arguments clearly exhibit the few fundamental assumptions on which the theory is based , thus producing results that can be attributed to a very general type of projective geometry .",

    "the even short shift - notation of @xcite seems not necessary for two - dimensional nets . )",
    "a _ discrete conjugate net _ is a discrete net such that every elementary quadrilateral @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is planar .    the choice of @xmath9 as parameter space is only a matter of convenience .",

    "we call a discrete net regular if for all @xmath14 the _ osculating planes _ @xmath15 in the first and second net direction are well - defined , that is , of projective dimension two . for the regularity of a discrete conjugate net we require additionally , that the four points @xmath16 are not collinear .",
    "non - regular nets are called _ singular . _    from a discrete conjugate net @xmath17 we derive two further discrete conjugate nets by means of the laplace transform ( @xcite ) :    the _ first and second laplace transforms _ of a regular discrete conjugate net are the discrete conjugate nets @xmath18 by regularity of @xmath17 , they are well - defined but not necessarily regular .    note that we adopt the indexing convention of @xcite since it is more convenient for our purposes than the convention used in of @xcite .",

    "it is , however , possible that the iterated construction breaks down at some point due to net singularities .",
    "another possibility is that the sequences become periodic .",
    "an instance of this is precisely the case we are interested in :    the laplace sequences of a discrete conjugate net @xmath17 are called a _ laplace cycle of period four _ , if @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , in this case we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 for any positive integer @xmath34 .",

    "note that the concepts of osculating plane , axis congruence and asymptotic transform make perfect sense in the smooth setting and proposition  [ prop:7 ] holds true as well , see  @xcite .    for an important class of discrete nets",

    "the necessity of our defining property is also established their . its sufficiency is not difficult to see and , in fact , is implicitly used in later publications .",
    "a more elementary characterization of w - congruences simply demands that the four lines @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 belong to a regulus ( * ? ? ?",
