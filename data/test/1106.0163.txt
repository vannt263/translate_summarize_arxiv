    "a familiar and general characteristic of new physics is extending the abelian gauge group associated with extra neutral vector bosons , usually labeled by @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 is often the lightest new particles beyond sm and easier to find in new colliders .",
    "another reason is that @xmath0 may play many important roles in theory , such as mediating the hidden sector , breaking susy , and solving the @xmath7 problem in minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "there are two issues arising from the new vector boson that pique our interests .",
    "one is @xmath0 mixings with electroweak neutral bosons @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which is a fashionable means to affect low - energy scale physics .",
    "this translates into very high sensitivity for electroweak precise observables ( ewpo ) that can be performed at @xmath8 resonance .",
    "many authors have investigated the issue and provided bounds on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "usually , a lighter @xmath0 is possible for larger mixing angles , although  smaller mixing angles exist only for heavier @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "more detailed results depend on mixing forms set by the models . with the exception of the minimal @xmath10 mass mixing , @xmath10 kinetic mixing",
    "is also discussed @xcite motivated by enlargement of the parameter space .",
    "because gauge symmetry allows the existence of kinetic mixings , we should consider all possible kinetic mixings despite their complexity .",
    "other motivations come from special applications in super - gravity and string theory models @xcite .",
    "the number of mixing parameters needed to describe complete mixings is the first question we will resolve in this paper .",
    "another interesting issue is @xmath0 interactions with leptons and quarks . as is well known , for a given @xmath3 gauge coupling @xmath11 , @xmath0 interactions are decided by charges assignment to fermions . in different models ,",
    "@xmath3 charges are assigned according to different consideration .",

    "we obtain two constraint conditions on mixings and charges :    * @xmath70 .",
    "this constraint can be expressed in terms of a rotation matrix in appendix [ approtationmatrix ] . in the particle physics context",
    ", it arises from the requirement for a massless photon . in the gauge eigenstate basis ,",
    "the factor @xmath71 generates a weak boson @xmath8 mass , that could include some component of a massive @xmath0 by @xmath10 mixing .",
    "@xmath72 however , it is forbidden to contain any component of photon so that the photon remains massless . letting the second term vanish on the r.h.s .",
    "of the above equation , we obtain @xmath73 providing one constraint condition . *",
    "another constraint comes from the last term in ( [ electriccharge ] ) . here",
    ", we have two auxiliary choices : either a vanishing @xmath74 or @xmath75 for each flavor . we know that @xmath74 in the rotation matrix @xmath47 plays a role in diagonalizing the stueckelberg mixing @xcite .",
    "thus , the former choice means that the @xmath31 vanishes .",
    "the latter strictly limits the @xmath0 interaction with fermions .",
    "in particular , in next subsection , we will see that the latter case yields @xmath13 type anomaly - free charge assignments .",
    "for this reason , it is surprising that the total left- and right - handed couplings are not required to be equal in ( [ electriccharge ] ) , yielding a single constraint .",
    "the reason is that , for a very heavy @xmath0 , the @xmath0 mixing tends to vanish and the total constraint reduces to the first constraint @xmath70 . from another point of view",
    ", the first constraint will arise from a @xmath76 mixing space without @xmath3 . when adding @xmath3 into the electroweak group , the second constraint appears . in this way",
    ", we can say that the two constraints do not include any enhancement .",
    "@xmath0 mixing makes the vector @xmath77 and axial - vector @xmath78 couplings diverge from sm values . from ( [ jz ] ) and ( [ jzprime ] )",
    ", we can obtain coupling corrections @xmath79 which provide @xmath0 low energy corrections .",
    "phenomenologically , these shifts will correct ewpo and can be bounded by electroweak precise test ( in sec .",
    "[ secfit ] , we will return to this issue ) .",
    "in contrast , neutral bosons mixings also correct @xmath0 couplings to fermions as follows @xmath80 for a heavy @xmath0 , mixing corrections usually are regards as negligible , which means @xmath0 couplings are mainly determined by the fermion charge @xmath59 .      up to now",
    ", @xmath3 fermion charges @xmath59 are random parameters that take different values in many @xmath0 models . except for the sm fermions",
    ", we always regard the right - handed neutrino as an exotic fermion in new physics models .",
    "usually , fermions are assigned universal family charges to avoid issues from flavor changing neutral currents . however , in the model - independent case , we are interested in the number of independent parameters is needed to describe universal family charge assignments .",
    "for example , in an @xmath24 symmetry , we can assign the same @xmath3 charge to the left - handed fermion two components , i.e. @xmath81 for quarks and @xmath82 for leptons .",
    "thus , the universal family charge assignment can be described by six charge parameters : @xmath83 and @xmath84 for both left - handed leptons and quarks , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the right - handed up quark , right - handed down quark , right - handed electron and right - handed neutrino , respectively .",
    "although the @xmath0 charge ca not be determined at this stage by current experiments , the @xmath3 charges of quarks and leptons must cancel the triangular anomaly to preserve gauge symmetry in the theory @xcite . the anomaly cancellation conditions can reduce the number of free charges to improve prediction of theory .",
    "additionally , we will prove below that the number of right - handed neutrinos is three or zero to cancel separately the @xmath4 ^ 3 $ ] anomaly and the mixed gravitational - gauge anomaly .",

    "there are two anomaly cancellation conditions , viz .",

    "@xmath98 this implies that there is only one right - handed neutrino for each generation .",
    "if we relax the constraint requiring two parameter dependence in ( [ chargeassignmenti ] ) to allow @xmath99 , a right - handed neutrino may not exist ( or does not couple to @xmath0 ) . in that case ,",
    "charge assignments of the sm fermions are described by only one free charge @xmath100    notice that if we use the stueckelberg coupling @xmath11 to choose @xmath101 for leptons and quarks , three right - handed neutrinos must exist to avoid a trivial solution where all couplings vanish .",
    "we can say the stueckelberg coupling loves right - handed neutrinos . at this point , the anomaly cancelling charge assignments become @xmath13 type , i.e. @xmath102 with a random constant of proportionality .    in brief , according to the renormalized electric charge ( [ electriccharge ] ) and existence of @xmath14 , there are three kinds of anomaly - free charges :    * case 1 : stueckelberg coupling @xmath103 and the existence of three @xmath14 .",
