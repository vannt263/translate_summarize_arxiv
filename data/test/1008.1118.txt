    "a computer is a machine which processes data according to a set of instructions .",
    "every computer is a composition of hardware on which information is processed and software by which information is processed .",
    "hardware is the physical part of a computer , while software is a collection of computer programs ( algorithms ) designed to perform a required task .",
    "a quantum computer ( qc ) emerges when the computation is executed under the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "there are several models for quantum computation .    the first conceptual model of a qc , the quantum turing machine ( qtm ) , was given by deutsch @xcite .",
    "it is rather an abstract model and useful for investigating the  computational complexity . \"",
    "the qtm is a quantum version of its classical analogue which allows the superposition of different computational paths .",
    "later on , a rather practical model of a qc  the unitary - evolution - based quantum computation model ( uqcm)was established @xcite .",
    "the uqcm is a quantum edition of  the reversible classical circuit model . \" in the step from classical to quantum , the bits are replaced by the qubits , and the logic gates are replaced by the quantum gates ( coherent unitary evolution ) . unlike the bits , the qubits can exist in a superposition of different computational states .",
    "unlike the logic gates , the quantum gates are able to create and destroy a superposition as well as an entanglement .",
    "the computation in uqcm is run by a sequence of unitary gates and represented by its circuit diagram , where the connecting wires stand for the logical qubits or bits which carry the information , and the information is processed by the sequence of quantum gates . in the end , the result of the computation is read out by the projective measurements on the qubits . in the well - known textbook by nielsen and chuang @xcite ,",
    "many popular algorithms such as deutsch s algorithm @xcite , grover s search algorithm @xcite , and shor s factoring algorithm @xcite are narrated in terms of the uqcm .",
    "the measurement - based quantum computation model ( mqcm ) is another well recognized model of a qc @xcite . here , a multi - qubit entangled state ",
    "known as a cluster state @xcite , or more generally a graph state @xcite  is the main ingredient , and it provides all the entanglement beforehand for the subsequent computation . the computation in this model is run by a sequence of single - qubit ( adaptive ) projective measurements on the graph state .",
    "the methods of mqcm enable one to simulate any quantum circuit on a sufficiently large two - dimensional graph state by arranging the spatial pattern of measurement bases for the graph qubits according to the temporal order of quantum gates in the circuit .    in the mqcm",
    ", the measurements on graph qubits are performed in a certain temporal order for the purpose of running the computation deterministically .",
    "furthermore , the measurement outcomes are recorded classically and are used for setting the measurement bases for the subsequent measurements @xcite . by contrast , in the uqcm there is no such temporal order of measurements , but an order in which the unitary gates are executed .",
    "the task of a qc is to `` simulate a quantum circuit . ''",
    "both the uqcm and the mqcm are universal : they can simulate any quantum circuit .",
    "where the uqcm uses the unitary gates , the mqcm uses the measurements for simulating a circuit . in this paper",
    "our focus will be on constructing a  hybrid \" model of the uqcm and the mqcm , which we call  hybrid quantum computation model \" ( hqcm ) , that combines elements of both the uqcm and the mqcm with the aim of exploiting the strengths of both models .",
    "of course , the hqcm is universal as well .",
    "there are two main objectives of the present investigation .",
    "the first objective is to develop a theoretical understanding of the hqcm , where part of a quantum circuit is simulated by unitary gates and the rest by measurements on small graph states .",
    "the second objective is the investigation of the experimental optimization .",
    "both the uqcm and the mqcm possess their own advantages along with some similarities .",
    "for example , where the implementation of an arbitrary single - qubit operation in the mqcm costs a chain of five qubits graph state @xcite , it can be implemented rather simply by a unitary evolution in the uqcm . in return , certain multi - qubit gates that are complicated in the uqcm can be realized in  one shot \" in the mqcm .",
    "here is an overview of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mqcm ] we give a brief review of the mqcm , it has two main parts .",

    "a unitary gate of this kind can be generated by turning on the ( controlled ) ising - type nearest - neighbor interaction for an appropriately chosen time period .",

    "as a side remark , the temporal order of the measurements does not typically follow the temporal order of gates in a circuit which we want to simulate with the mqcm . in the mqcm",

    "in this section , we formulate the methodology of the hybrid quantum computation model ( hqcm ) by combining the advantages of the uqcm and the mqcm . before going into the details ,",
    "let us first focus on what benefits we can get from each of the models in different situations . here , we consider the preparation of a graph state , the set of elementary gates for the hqcm , and the simulation of a quantum circuit with the hqcm one by one .",
    "the very first experimental step in the mqcm is the preparation of a resource graph state , whereas in the uqcm no such preparation of a resource is needed . while preparing a graph state , in principle , the initialization of every graph qubit in the @xmath6 eigenbasis can be completed in one shot . to this end",
    ", we have to `` talk '' to every graph qubit simultaneously .",
    "consequently , this requires a lot of experimental resources , and the very many interactions are difficult to control .",
    "likewise , the subsequent two - qubit entangling operations ( @xmath117 s given by eq .",
    "( [ cz ] ) ) to create the resource graph state can be performed in one step , because they commute with each other . and",
    ", the larger the graph state , the more difficult it is to prepare and control the state and to protect it against decoherence .",
    "so , for the hqcm , we choose not to prepare the whole two - dimensional universal graph state at once , but instead prepare small ( non - universal ) graph states step - by - step as we need them when the computation progresses .",
    "only the star graph states , such as @xmath118 given in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) , are required for the hqcm .",
    "we choose single - qubit operations , the @xmath17 gate and the multi - qubit rotation around the @xmath1-axis @xmath52 for an arbitrary value of @xmath119 given by eq .",
    "( [ nr ] ) as the elementary gates for hqcm . in analogy to the procedure for the uqcm ,",
    "first we `` efficiently decompose '' any big unitary gate we are trying to simulate into a sequence of elementary gates in such a way that the number of elementary gates grows polynomially with the number of logical qubits , and then every elementary gate is implemented one after another .",
    "every single - qubit operation and the @xmath17 gate are carried out by the unitary evolution under the formalism of uqcm .",
    "the rotation @xmath52 is implemented by the method given in sec .  [ sec : methodology1qc ] ( see the example ) under the formalism of mqcm .",
    "the motivation behind these choices is explained in the following .",
    "the implementation of an arbitrary single - qubit rotation in the mqcm costs us at least a chain of five qubits graph state and four measurements @xcite .",
    "but it can be realized quite simply by the unitary evolution of the respective single qubit . furthermore , the euler decomposition for an arbitrary single - qubit rotation @xmath72 given in eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) is not needed .",
    "the @xmath17 operations themselves are part of the experimental setup for constructing the graph states , and for this we have to execute them by the unitary evolution .",
    "that is why we consider the @xmath17 gate as an elementary gate for the hqcm .",
    "furthermore , it is more economical to implement @xmath85 by the unitary evolution @xmath120 instead of first preparing a 15-qubit graph state and then implement it with the mqcm @xcite .",
    "although we already have the universal set of gates ( single - qubit and @xmath17 gates ) , we prefer to include @xmath52 as an elementary gate in the hqcm .",
    "this is because of two reasons .",
    "the first reason is the optimization .",
    "the resource @xmath39-qubit graph state @xmath118 ( given by eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) ) needed for the implementation of @xmath52 is relatively easy to create experimentally .",
    "it has only one ancilla qubit , and the entanglement can be established in one shot .",
    "furthermore , a single measurement on the ancilla qubit is enough to realize @xmath52 all together on @xmath36 logical qubits .",
    "while it is also possible to decompose the rotation @xmath52 in terms of the gates from the universal gate set and implement it under the formalism of uqcm , its implementation there will not be so optimal , and we can not regard it as a single unit .    generally , one is using either unitary evolution ( uqcm ) or measurements on the graph state ( mqcm ) in order to simulate a quantum circuit .",
    "so , the second reason for including @xmath52 as an elementary gate in the hqcm is to investigate a model of qc in which a part of a circuit ( @xmath52 rotations ) is simulated by the measurements and the rest by the unitary evolution , and to see how the classical information processing plays its role in such a model .",
    "the importance of looking at the classical information - processing parts is explained in the following .",
    "now let us consider the simulation of a sequence of gates with the hqcm in which the classical information processing becomes crucial .",
    "the classical processing does not come into the picture of uqcm where the measurements are used only for the readout of the final result of computation . in all those schemes where measurements are needed for the computation ( for example quantum teleportation @xcite ) ,",
    "the classical information processing in parallel is essential . in the hqcm also , classical information processing is needed , because the rotations @xmath52 are executed by the measurements .",
    "but here the classical information - processing parts are rather simple and straightforward , requiring only the information flow vector and the propagation matrices . a comprehensive discussion of this is given in the following section .",
    "in this section , our focus will be on the classical information - processing parts of the hqcm .",
    "we only need the information flow vector and the propagation matrices for the elementary gates .",
    "we first redefine the information flow vector in the context of hqcm , and then discuss the propagation relations as well as the propagation matrices for the elementary gates .    at every computation step @xmath121",
    ", the form of the byproduct operator is the same , as given in eqs .",
    "( [ i ] ) and ( [ byprombqcm ] ) , @xmath122 so , the form of the related information flow vector @xmath123 is also the same as given by the @xmath124 column vector in eqs .",
    "( [ i ] ) and ( [ iso ] ) .",
    "but in the hqcm , there are some differences in comparison to the efficient measurement scheme of mqcm given in appendix  [ sec : ems ] . in that scheme of mqcm , the index ` @xmath125 ' of @xmath126 stands for ` the measurement round . '",
    "but in the hqcm , every elementary gate is taken as a single computational step , and the index ` @xmath121 ' of @xmath127 is the label for them . in the mqcm ,",
    "@xmath126 gets updated after each round , but in the hqcm it is updated after each gate .    in this scheme of mqcm ,",
    "the initial value of the information flow vector @xmath128 is determined by the set of eigenvalues @xmath34 and by some particular gates .",
