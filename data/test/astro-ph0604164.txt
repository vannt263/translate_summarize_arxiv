    "the progenitor stars of core - collapse supernova explosions form in giant molecular clouds .",
    "since these massive stars have a short lifetime many of them end their lives while the parental clouds are still nearby and may even still harbor small star forming regions that produce stars of lower mass . according to in galaxies like ours",
    "about 70% of all supernova explosions are of type ii and should explode close to the dense clouds from which they were formed . after these stars explode ,",
    "strong shocks are driven into the clouds , heating , compressing , dissociating , and accelerating the gas leading to a large variety of observable effects .",
    "a picture book example is the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) ic  443 on which most studies of snr - molecular cloud interactions have been focused .",
    "but recently more and more snrs have been discovered interacting with molecular clouds , e.g.  w28 , w44 , 3c  391 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and many others , among them the galactic snr ctb  109  ( g109.11.0 ) .    ctb  109  was first discovered as an snr in x - rays with _ einstein _",
    "@xcite and in radio in the 610  mhz galactic plane survey @xcite .",
    "it has a semi - circular morphology in both the x - ray and the radio and is located next to a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complex in the west .",
    "this semi - circular morphology suggests that the snr shock has been stopped entirely by the gmc complex , and that the appearance is not simply due to absorption .",
    "a linear feature in co ( ` co arm ' ) extends from the gmc complex to the local x - ray minimum in the northern half implying that a part of the gmc complex extends in front of the remnant ( see fig.[chandraco ] ) .",
    "the cold interstellar medium in which the remnant is embedded has been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the most puzzling x - ray morphological feature in ctb  109  is the bright , extended interior region known as the ` lobe ' .",
    "the x - ray spectrum from the lobe obtained with _ xmm - newton _  is completely thermal @xcite .",
    "the lobe could be the result of a hole in the gmc allowing the x - ray emission through with little or no absorption or it could be the result of intrinsically brighter emission due to an interaction between the shock and the cloud . in order to investigate the later hypothesis we obtained new high resolution x - ray and co data .",
    "observations of the @xmath1co and @xmath5co ( j=@xmath6 ) spectral lines , at 45  resolution , were obtained using the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14  m antenna in march 2003 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with the 32  element sequoia focal plane array @xcite .",
    "the data were acquired through on - the - fly mapping , in which the telescope was scanned continuously across the sky while reading out the spectrometers at regular intervals of 1125 .",
    "calibration to the @xmath7 scale was done using the chopper wheel method @xcite , and the data were converted to the radiation temperature scale ( @xmath8 ) by correcting for forward scattering and spillover losses ( @xmath9  =  0.7 ) .",
    "the 1024-channel spectrometers were set to a total bandwidth of 25  mhz ( @xmath10 ) centered on @xmath11 .",
    "following recording of the data , the spectra were converted onto a regular grid of 225  pixel spacing using the fcrao _ otftool _ software .",
    "the new data have higher sensitivity than the cgps data @xcite and are fully nyquist sampled . the higher sensitivity and the full sampling allow us to detect the faint clouds around the lobe and study them in great detail .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observations have shown that the x - ray bright lobe is thermal and seem to indicate an interaction between the shock wave and a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "therefore , we proposed an additional deep observation with _ chandra _  to probe the shock - cloud interaction region at higher angular resolution .",
    "the observation was performed using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) in full - frame , timed - event mode with an exposure of 80  ksec ( obsid 4626 ) .",
    "the data were taken in the energy band of @xmath12.03em0.3  10.0  kev .",
    "the acis - i array covered the northeast part of the snr and the northern tip of the lobe was observed at the aimpoint .",
    "the data are analyzed with ciao 3.2.2 and caldb 3.1.0 .",
    "the complete analysis of these data including a detailed spectral analysis of the whole area will be presented in a different paper .    here , we present the high - resolution x - ray image of the lobe of ctb  109  obtained with _ chandra _",
    "the image is binned with a size of 4 pixels ( 1 pixel = 0.492 ) and smoothed with a gaussian with a sigma of 2 pixels ( the original pixels binned by 4 ) .",
    "x - ray spectra which are extracted at regions corresponding to co clouds are also discussed , in order to obtain the absorbing foreground hydrogen column density ( ) . the spectra are binned with a minimum of 50 counts per bin and analyzed using the x - ray spectral analysis tool xspec . to fit the spectra",
    ", we use a model for a thermal plasma in non - equilibrium ionization with variable abundances ( vnei ) and hydrogen column density , , for the foreground absorption ( phabs ) .",
    "in figure [ chandraco ] we display the distribution of molecular gas in the vicinity of the x - ray lobe . in the left image ,",
    "the co arm discovered by is shown .",
    "the anti - correlation of the co emission with the _ chandra _  image nicely demonstrates that this molecular cloud is located in the foreground and absorbs the x - ray emission from ctb  109  coming from behind it . in the right panel we averaged the co emission over a velocity range more negative than that of the co arm .",
    "we can identify three small molecular clouds surrounding the eastern part of ctb  109 s x - ray lobe with the brightest to the galactic east ( on the left side of the lobe in fig.[chandraco ] , hereafter east ) , a fainter one to the galactic north ( above the lobe , hereafter north ) , and another one in the galactic south ( below the lobe , hereafter south ) which is not fully covered by our observations . the noise level in the image",
    "is @xmath12.03em40  mk . assuming the progenitor star exploded at or close to the current position of the anomalous x - ray pulsar 1e2259 + 586 , the location of these clouds is suggestive of an interaction of the snr shock wave with those molecular clouds resulting in the x - ray lobe .",
    "most of the molecular clouds are rather faint in the @xmath5co line , which is why we can not perform a detailed comparison with the @xmath1co measurements .",
    "however , we can estimate an average brightness ratio for each of the clouds ( see table [ cotab ] ) .",
    "the value for the southern cloud is a bit difficult to interpret since it is not fully covered by our observations and it seems to consist of a number of small clouds .",
    "we find brightness ratios between 3.5 in the dense part of the co arm and 13 in the southern clouds . according to @xcite , at the galactocentric radius of ctb  109",
    "the @xmath1c to @xmath5c isotope ratio @xmath13 should be about 63 .",
    "this indicates that we miss some of the @xmath1co emission and this line is optically thick .    in the following we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium and the same excitation temperature for both isotopic species and all molecules along the line of sight in each cloud .",
    "we determine an average optical depth for each cloud in both lines by the following procedure : we use the @xmath1co to @xmath5co ratio for each cloud to determine how much @xmath1co emission we are missing by assuming the @xmath5co line is optically thin .",
    "this can be translated to a first iteration for the optical depth @xmath14 .",
    "if both species have the same excitation temperature the @xmath1co to @xmath5co brightness temperature ratio @xmath13 can be written as : @xmath15 . from this",
    "we determine a first iteration for the optical depth @xmath16 of the @xmath5co line .",
    "this is again used to determine a better value for the missing @xmath1co emission and so on .",
    "this iterative procedure converges usually after just a few iterations .",
    "the results for @xmath14 and @xmath16 are listed in table [ cotab ] . to integrate the @xmath5co column density we actually use the @xmath1co data scaled to @xmath5co by the brightness ratios for each individual cloud since the signal to noise ratio is higher in our @xmath1co data . the @xmath5co column density",
    "is then scaled by @xmath17 to determine the column density of the h@xmath18  molecules  @xcite .",
    "we also estimate h@xmath19 number densities and masses of the clouds ( table [ cotab ] ) . while the northern cloud , the southern cloud , and the faint eastern tail of the eastern cloud have comparable h@xmath18  column densities ( @xmath20  @xmath3 ) , the bright part of the eastern cloud that overlaps the lobe has a higher  @xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that we calculated a peak h@xmath19 column density of @xmath21  @xmath3 for the co arm , which compares nicely with the value of @xmath22  @xmath3 determined by .    in order to compare with these results ,",
    "we extract spectra from the _ chandra _   data in regions corresponding to the co clouds and derive the atomic h column density  in the foreground by fitting the spectrum with a model including a thermal non - equilibrium ionization model and a foreground absorption . for the northern cloud ,",
    "we obtain = 6.3 ( 5.6  7.0 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 ( 90% confidence range in parentheses ) . for the larger eastern cloud , the foreground absorption of the part inside the lobe is  = 4.5 ( 4.2  4.9 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 , outside the lobe",
    ", we get  = 5.9 ( 5.5  6.4 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 , and in the eastern tail the foreground absorption is  = 5.0 ( 4.2  5.4 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 . although the  column density is largest in the bright part of the eastern cloud , the foreground  is the lowest .",
    "therefore , the eastern cloud is not located in front of the lobe .",
    "the foreground absorption in the region of the southern cloud is  = 6.8 ( 5.8  7.3 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 .",
    "the x - ray absorption is significantly higher in the regions corresponding to the northern cloud and the southern cloud than in the eastern tail of the eastern cloud .",
    "it seems that these two clouds are located in front of the remnant and absorb some of the x - ray emission .",
    "as the snr is believed to be located next to the gmc , we assume that both have a systematic velocity of @xmath24 .",
    "the three clouds ( radial velocities between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) are slightly blue - shifted from the gmc to the west , indicating that these clouds are moving towards us relative to the gmc complex .",
    "as the bright eastern cloud seems to be related to the x - ray lobe , we study the velocity profiles of the @xmath1co emission in different parts of the eastern cloud .",
    "this cloud contains the infrared ( ir ) source iras23004 + 5841 , which has ir colors of a star forming region according to .",
    "figure [ covelocities ] compares the profiles taken at the center of iras23004 + 5841 ( position a ) and in the interior of the lobe ( position b , as marked in the right panel in fig.[chandraco ] ) .",
    "while the first appears gaussian , the latter has an additional component towards higher negative velocities .",
    "the asymmetry observed in the spectrum suggests that the material has been accelerated by the shock wave of the snr which traveled into the cloud .",
    "the co line profile is only broadened by a few km  s@xmath27 which indicates that the acceleration is mostly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the estimated mass of the part of the cloud with the high velocity wing is 3  4  @xmath28 .",
    "we have also taken profiles from parts of the east cloud that do not overlap with the lobe .",
    "the velocity profiles of the northern end of the east cloud and the faint tail in the east show that there is a velocity gradient .",
    "the center of the profile changes from @xmath29 to @xmath30 with increasing distance to the lobe , i.e.  the eastern part of the cloud is red - shifted relative to the western part .",
    "this gradient indicates an acceleration of the gas in the faint tail away from the eastern cloud .",
    "as the gradient starts at the position of iras23004 + 5841 , it might be an outflow from the star forming region .",
    "the column densities of h@xmath18  and the x - ray absorbing hydrogen indicate that the northern cloud and the southern cloud are located in front of the x - ray emission",
    ". the eastern cloud , however , seems to be linked to the lobe .",
    "moreover , the co velocity profile shows an additional blue - shifted component in the eastern cloud where it overlaps the lobe , suggesting that the cloud has been hit by a shock .",
    "the eastern tail of the eastern cloud does nt show such an additional velocity component and seems to be red - shifted relative to the interacting part of the cloud .",
    "figure [ skizze ] illustrates how the bright eastern co cloud and the lobe are possibly located within the remnant . as in such a configuration",
    ", the cloud would have a significant velocity component towards us at position b whereas the acceleration is directed perpendicular to the line of sight at position a , a high velocity wing in the velocity profile of the cloud is only observed at position b.    as we believe that the x - ray lobe was formed by evaporation of a cloud , we estimate the cloud mass from the x - ray emission .",
    "we assume that the emission is coming only from the lobe and that the evaporated cloud now fills a sphere with a radius of 3 .",
    "the xspec model vnei that we use for the spectral fits , gives the normalization @xmath31 \\times \\int n_e n_h dv$ ] .",
    "the mean @xmath32 per arcsec@xmath33 in the lobe is 2.0@xmath34  @xmath35  arcsec@xmath36 . for a distance @xmath37",
    "= 3  kpc @xcite and @xmath38 = 1.2 @xmath39 , we get @xmath39 = 0.9  @xmath40 and a mass of @xmath41 for the x - ray gas of the lobe .",
    "the mass of the observed co clouds are higher than the estimated mass of the evaporated cloud",
    ". this could be the reason why the clouds still exist .",
    "we performed observations of @xmath1co and @xmath5co as well as a _",
    "chandra _   observation of the region around the x - ray lobe of ctb  109 .",
    "we have discovered three co clouds around the lobe .",
    "all three clouds are blue - shifted relative to the gmc in the west of ctb  109 .",
    "the foreground   indicates that two clouds in the north and in the south of the lobe are located in front of the bright x - ray lobe , whereas the east cloud might be connected to the lobe .",
    "therefore , the east co cloud and the x - ray lobe seem to be evidence for an interaction between the snr shock wave and a dense cloud .",
    "the velocity profiles of the @xmath1co emission in the east cloud show that there is a velocity gradient in the faint tail in the east , indicating that the eastern part of the cloud is red - shifted .",
    "the bright western part of the cloud overlaps with the x - ray lobe .",
    "the @xmath1co velocity profile at this position has an negative velocity wing indicating an additional acceleration in this part of the cloud . at this position",
    "where the co and the bright x - ray emission overlap , there is also an extended ir source ( iras23004 + 5841 ) which might be emission from a star forming region . from the new co and x - ray data",
    "we conclude that we have found strong evidence for a shock - cloud interaction at the north - east end of the x - ray lobe .",
