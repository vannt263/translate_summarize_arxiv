    "dwingeloo  1 is a nearby barred spiral system discovered in the line by kraan - korteweg ( 1994 ) during the dwingeloo obscured galaxies survey for galaxies hidden in the zone of avoidance .",
    "subsequent optical and infrared observations by loan ( 1996 ) , aspin & tilanus ( priv . comm . ) , and mccall & buta ( 1996 ) , as well as interferometric  observations by burton ( 1996 ) , describe dw1 as of morphological type sbb at an inclination of @xmath2 , with a systemic velocity with respect to the lsr of @xmath3 , and at a distance estimated to be 3 mpc .",
    "the small galaxy dwingeloo  2 was discovered by burton ( 1996 ) in the primary beam of the westerbork observations as pointed towards dw1 . in view of its angular and kinematic proximity to dw1 , and in view of distortions in its velocity field",
    ", it seems likely that dw2 is a companion of the larger system .",
    "the two galaxies are probably members of the group containing maffei  1 & 2 and ic@xmath4342 and may influence the motions and morphology of that group and , by the group collectively , of our own local group .",
    "there is yet but little information on the star - forming potential of dw1 and dw2 .",
    "loan reported numerous  regions in dw1 .",
    "li ( 1996 ) detected what they characterised as weak co  j  =  10 emission from the core of dw1 .",
    "the ratio of co ",
    "to  emissivity varies widely in galaxies , especially in barred galaxies ( see e.g. young & scoville 1991 ) .",
    "but li were not able to conclude from their single spectrum if the ratio in dw1 is unusally low , or if the galaxy belongs amongst those that show a central hole in the molecular gas distribution .",
    "the results of the exploratory survey reported here indicate that dw1 is not a strong co emitter , but that both its co emission and the co ",
    "to  ratio fall within the range exhibited by ordinary galaxies . rather than showing a central hole the molecular emission from the core",
    "is in fact more intense than that from beyond the core .",
    "we were unable to detect any co emission from dw2 .",
    "the observations of dw1 and dw2 were made with the james clerk maxwell telescope atop mauna kea in july and august of 1995 .",
    "we used the a2 receiver which employs a lead ",
    "alloy sis mixer and a carlstrom  gunn local oscillator ; it has a noise temperature of about 95k .",
    "the typical single  sideband system temperature is about 350k at 230ghz .",
    "the das digital autocorrelator backend was used with 2048 channels and configured for a total bandwidth of 500mhz ; during data reduction the velocity resolution was subsequently smoothed to 5mhz , about 6.5@xmath5 .",
    "the size of the beam of the jcmt 15m attenna at the frequency ( 230.5380 ghz ) of the co  j  =  21 transition is 21@xmath6 .",
    "the absolute pointing of the observations was good to about 2.5@xmath6 rms ; relative pointing was better than this .",
    "the dw1 spectra were obtained by position  switching the telescope to reference positions which were in general also located on that galaxy , but at the opposite side of the bar . since galactic rotation shifts the signals from the two sides well",
    "apart in frequency , this strategy seemed a valid one to optimize the use of telescope time . in order to guard against accidental subtraction of emission due to an overlapping signal at the reference position ,",
    "several different reference positions were commonly used with each ` on ' position , and the profiles from each set carefully compared .",
    "the spectra were calibrated in units of the main  beam brightness temperature ( ) , and corrected for sideband gains , for atmospheric emission in both sidebands , and for telescope efficiency",
    ". the rms surface accuracy of the jcmt is of order 30@xmath7 m . at the co  j=21 frequency ,",
    "the forward - scattering and spillover efficiency , , has a value of 0.8 ; the main - beam efficiency , , is 0.69 .",
    "residual baseline offsets were corrected by polynomal baseline removal .",
    "we observed a total of 15 positions in dw1 with the inner 11 on a cross which had 34@xmath6 spacings and was rotated over a position angle of 118@xmath8 to align it with the central bar of dw1 .",
    "the grid corresponds to an ( @xmath9 ) cell of @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the center of dw1 , our ( 0,0 ) position , was taken as @xmath12(1950 ) = 02@xmath1353@xmath14 , @xmath15(1950 ) = 58@xmath1642@xmath1738@xmath6 @xmath18 at an lsr velocity of 110@xmath5 , corresponding to the values determined initially by kraan  korteweg ( 1994 ) and confirmed by the wsrt observations by burton ( 1996 ) .",
    "the remaining 4 positions were located at larger distances at @xmath19 and @xmath20 along the direction of the bar .",
    "the jcmt co spectra are shown in figure  1 , superposed on the spectra observed by burton ( 1996 ) using the wsrt .",
    "the  data were convolved to the spatial resolution of the current co data prior to the extraction of the spectra . shown in the center of the figure is a ukirt k  band image of dw1 observed by colin aspin and remo tilanus and provided to us in advance of publication . of the 15 positions searched for co ,",
    "5 are located on the central bar .",
    "co emission was detected at most of the positions observed with peak main  beam brightness temperatures of @xmath0 70 .",
    "the kinematics revealed by the co data are consistent with those seen in  at the positions where both tracers were detected .",
    "it is interesting to note that the strength of the co line relative to that of the line decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus ; thus dw1 is generally not a strong molecular emitter , nor is it a galaxy with an anomalously low molecular component in the core .",
    "the sky conditions on successive nights at the jcmt were quite variable , and thus so were the integration times invested in each observation ; the rms noise level varies from profile to profile .",
    "the spectra have been smoothed in velocity to a resolution of 6.5 @xmath5 .",
    "the spectra have also been interpolated across a velocity range extending from @xmath21 to @xmath22 in order to blank out some co emission contributed by a foreground molecular cloud located in the milky way ; this foreground emission was also evident near zero velocity in the spectrum observed by li ( 1996 ) .",
    "we can not rule out additional contamination from low level milky way emission at velocities less than @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the spectral values have been blanked at those velocities where a strong emission feature was present at the reference position .",
    "it is necessary to have accurate positional information to assist superposition of data garnered at different wavelengths .",
    "table 1 lists astrometric positions of stars located around the direction of dw1 , as determined from poss prints .",
    "the accuracy of the positions is about one second of arc .",

    "the overall appearance of the co j = 21 spectra supports the conclusion of li ( 1996 ) that the co emission from the nucleus of dw1 is relatively weak , but only in the sense that it is much weaker ( by an order of magnitude ) than the strong co emission from its neighbours , ic  342 and maffei  2 .",
    "li speculated that the co emission from the nucleus of dw1 might not be typical of the galaxy as a whole , but that dw1 might be characterised by a central hole in the distribution of molecular gas .",
    "the present observations show , however , that the co emission from the nuclear region is actually substantially more intense than that detected along the bar or from the spiral arms . along the bar",
    ", there is a general decline of the co emission towards the start of arms at the end of the bar . just beyond the bar  arm intersections in the interarm regions",
    "the co emission becomes undetectable .",
    "the profiles observed perpendicular to the bar at 68@xmath6 distance from the nucleus , especially north , show some indication that co emission is associated with the arms .",
    "further support for this comes from the profiles observed along the bar at @xmath27 which may be located along the continuation of the spiral arms visible in the k  band image and show emission at the expected velocities .",
    "in contrast , the two positions closer in ( @xmath28 ) , which are clearly interarm locations , show no detectable co emission . however , the coverage of the current observations is insufficient to support a firm statement on the detailed association of co emission with the spiral arms .",
    "these conclusions are supported by figure  2 , which shows the integrated co emission as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "figure  2 also shows the radial distribution of  from the observations of burton ( 1996 ) .",
    "to  ratio by mass observed in many other galaxies covers a wide range of values .",
    "the lower panel of figure  2 shows that in dw1 the  and h@xmath29 masses are rather similar outside of the nucleus , where h@xmath29 dominates by a factor of about 2.5 .",
    "the relative amount of atomic and molecular gas in dw1 is thus not very different from the situation pertaining in the more familiar galaxy m33 .",
    "figure  3 shows the co spectrum observed toward the nucleus of dwingeloo  1 , together with a three  component gaussian decomposition of the observation .",
    "the integrated intensity of @xmath30 k[]@xmath5 is about 45% higher than the value for the integrated co  j=10 line found by li ( 1996 ) with a 55@xmath6 beam ( and after multiplying our number by /@xmath31 for the comparison ) .",
    "their profile , which was smoothed to a resolution of 15@xmath5 , does not show the double  peaked structure which our observation does .",
    "the two principal gaussians peak at 106.5@xmath5 and 122.0@xmath5 , respectively , suggesting a systemic lsr velocity of about 114@xmath5 , which is a velocity close to the fitted center of the broad component , at 118@xmath5 , and which agrees well with the center of a single  component gaussian fit , at 115@xmath5 .",
    "the single  component fwhm width is about 40@xmath5 .",
    "the + 34@xmath6 profile also is double  peaked like the nuclear profile .",
    "most likely these spectra show non - circular streaming motions of the gas caused by the presence of a bar .",
    "the  observations by burton ( 1996 ) place the dynamic center of the galaxy 5 arcseconds east and south of our ( 0,0 ) position .    if we adopt a value of the co(21)/co(10 ) intensity ratio of 0.8 as found for the milky way by sanders ( 1992 ) and the co(10)to ",
    "h@xmath32 conversion factor of @xmath33 h@xmath34@xmath35 @xmath36 advocated for the milky way by scoville ( 1987 ) and by bloemen ( 1986 ) , we find that the average h@xmath32 column density and the assumed co(21)/co(10 ) intensity ratio of 0.8 ] within the central 21@xmath6 of dw1 is @xmath37 n(h@xmath32)@xmath38 corresponding to a surface density of @xmath39 and a total h@xmath32 mass of @xmath40 . correcting for an inclination of 50@xmath16 , one finds a deprojected average h@xmath32 surface density and total h@xmath32 mass for the central 300pc of dwingeloo  1 of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we also attempted to detect co  j=21 emission from dwingeloo  2 .",
    "the small total velocity width of dw2 shown in the  data of burton ( 1996 ) , its small size ( assuming it is located at the same distance as dw1 ) , and the fact that it has been detected only at a weak level in the infrared , together lead one to expect that the co signal , if detected at all , would be very weak .",
    "we confined the jcmt observations to integrations towards the nucleus of dw2 , but were not able to detect co emission above a 3@xmath43 threshold of 40mk .",
    "the molecular emission observed from the nearby galaxy dw1 in the co  j=21 line is relatively weak compared to its neighbours ic342 and maffei  2 , but is in the normal range for an ordinary galaxy .",
    "the emission could be followed in the jcmt observations reported here over the extent of the bar and into the spiral arms emanating from the ends of the bar .",
    "thus it seems that dw1 does not belong to the category of barred systems with a central hole in the molecular distribution ; the molecular emission is comparable throughout the galaxy , although relatively more intense in the core than in the bar or spiral - arm regions . outside of the nucleus , where h@xmath32 dominates  by a factor of about 2.5 ,",
    "the atomic and molecular masses are rather similar .",
    "we were unable to detect co emission from the nucleus of dw2 ; this negative result is not unexpected for a dwarf companion system .",
    "the james clerk maxwell telescope is operated by the observatories on behalf of the particle physics and astrophysics council of the united kingdom , the netherlands foundation for research in astronomy , and the national research council of canada .",
    "we are grateful to chris dudley ( ifa , university of hawaii ) for help with the stellar astrometry , to colin aspin ( ukirt ) for agreeing that we use the aspin / tilanus k  band image of dwingeloo  1 , and to marc verheijen ( groningen ) for providing the wsrt  spectra in the form used here in figure  1 .",
