    "the dicke and tavis - cummings ( tc ) hamiltonian describe a system of @xmath2 two - level atoms interacting with a single monochromatic electromagnetic radiation mode within a cavity @xcite .",
    "one of the most representative feature of these hamiltonians is their second - order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ( equivalent in the present models to the semi - classical limit ) .",
    "the ground state of the system goes from a normal to a superradiant state when the atom - field interaction reaches a critical value . in a companion paper @xcite ,",
    "hereon referred to as ( i ) , it was shown that the semi - classical approximation to the density of states ( dos ) describes very well the averaged quantum density of states ( qdos ) . from the semi - classical description , the presence of two different excited - state quantum phase transitions ( esqpts ) was clearly established in these models .",
    "one esqpt , referred to as _",
    "static _ , occurs for any coupling at an energy @xmath3 , where the whole phase space associated with the two - levels atoms ( the pseudo - spin sphere ) becomes available for the system .",
    "the second esqpt , referred to as _ dynamic _ , can take place only in the superradiant phase , at energies @xmath4 .",
    "this transition occurs when the top of the double well ( dicke ) or mexican hat ( tc ) potential that develops in the superradiant phase is attained .",
    "the previous results allow to study the properties of the quantum fluctuations using the semi - classical dos to separate the tendency or secular variation of the spectrum from its fluctuations .",
    "it is known that the tendency of the qdos depends completely on the particular system , but the properties of the fluctuations are universal @xcite . for quantum systems with a classical analogue integrable",
    "the fluctuations are common with those of the so - called gaussian diagonal ensemble ( gde ) , while for time - reversal - symmetric quantum systems with classical analogue hard chaotic , the fluctuations are those of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite numerical evidence was presented that suggests a relationship between the normal to superradiant phase transition and the onset of chaos in the non - integrable dicke model .",
    "more recently @xcite this relationship was studied more closely and it was suggested that the onset of chaos is caused by the precursors of the _ dynamic _ esqpt occurring in the superradiant phase . in this contribution",
    "we go further in the study of this relationship between the onset of chaos and singular behavior of the dos ( esqpt ) and ground - state energy ( qpt ) . to this end",
    "we consider the non - integrable dicke model and its integrable approximation , the tavis - cummings model .",
    "we study these models as a function of both the coupling between atoms and field , and the excitation energy .",
    "the presence of chaos for different energies and coupling constants is exhibited , in the semi - classical limit , employing poincar sections .",
    "the role of the classical chaos in the dicke model has been recently studied in the context of the equilibration of unitary quantum dynamics @xcite . in the quantum case peres lattices",
    "are presented , which allow to characterize regular and chaotic regions qualitatively .",
    "a quantitative measure of the properties of the energy spectrum is also presented by means of testing if the nearest neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) of the unfolded energies follows the wigner distribution of the goe .",
    "the results of the classical model are compared to the quantum ones .",
    "similar to the results of ref.@xcite , a clear correspondence between classical and quantum results are found for finite quantum system ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "it is found that the onset of chaos in the dicke model can only take place in the energy region where the quadratic approximation of the hamiltonian , the one obtained by considering small oscillations around the global energy minimum , fails to describe semiclassical model dynamics . for any coupling there",
    "always exist a low energy interval above the ground state where only regular patterns are observed .",
    "in particular , for the very small coupling regime @xmath7 this energy interval extends to infinity . above these low energy region",
    "the quadratic approximation breaks down and room is left for the onset of chaos .",
    "even if an indirect connection between the esqpts and the onset of chaos can be identified through the unstable fixed points , the onset of chaos is a much richer phenomenon than the occurrence of non - analytic behavior in the density of states or the ground - state energy .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we present briefly the quantum dicke and tavis - cummings hamiltonians and their classical analogues , and summarize some of their properties . in section",
    "iii a qualitatively analysis of the spectrum is done via peres lattices and poincar sections , revealing a clear classical and quantum correspondence at the onset of chaos , both in the normal and superradiant phases .",
    "the properties of the energy fluctuations are studied by means of the anderson - darling test for the nnsd against the wigner distribution .",
    "section iv contains the conclusions .",
    "the dicke and tavis - cummings hamiltonians are made of three parts : one associated to the monochromatic quantized radiation field ( boson operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , a second one to the atomic sector ( pseudo - spin operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and a last one which describes the interaction between them @xmath12 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the tc and dicke models , respectively .",
    "a quantum phase transition , from the normal to the so - called superradiant phase , takes place at a value of the coupling constant given by @xmath15 .",
    "we will focus on the subspace with largest pseudo - spin , where @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the tc hamiltonian is integrable because it commutes with the @xmath17 operator , @xmath18 .",
    "its conserved eigenvalues @xmath19 define a set of subspaces where the tc hamiltonian can be diagonalized independently .",
    "the dicke hamiltonian is not integrable , but its hilbert space can be separated in two sectors depending on the eigenvalue ( @xmath20 ) of the parity operator @xmath21 .    the classical version of the dicke and tc models can be obtained employing the _ naive _ substitution @xcite of the pseudospin variables by classical angular momentum ones ( @xmath22 ) , and the substitution of the boson variables by a classical harmonic oscillator ( variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) with @xmath25 .",
    "the pseudospin variables satisfy the poisson - bracket algebra @xmath26 . from there canonical variables",
    "@xmath27 can be obtained as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath31 whose magnitude is constant @xmath32 . in terms of the canonical variables the classical dicke hamiltonian reads @xmath33.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from here the equations of motion are @xmath34 \\label{php}\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{d j_z}{dt}&=&-\\frac{\\partial h_{cl}}{\\partial \\phi}=2\\gamma\\sqrt{j}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{j_z^2}{j^2}}\\nonumber\\\\   & \\times & \\left[(1+\\delta ) q\\sin\\phi + ( 1-\\delta ) p\\cos\\phi\\right].\\label{jp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      for couplings in the superradiant phase , a new energy region appears below the normal phase lowest energy .",
    "this new energy region corresponds , from a classical point of view , to the motion of the pseudospin variables in the double well energy surface where the parity symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the top of this double well energy surface is given by the ground state energy of the normal phase ( @xmath4 ) , where the _ dynamical _ esqpt takes place .",
    "as a first example in this coupling regime , we consider a coupling near but above the critical one @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding peres lattices are shown in fig.[fig14 ] , whereas the classical poincar sections are shown in fig.[fig15 ] . as it happened in the previous cases and as expected according to the fig.[figval ] , for the low energy regime a regular lattice is obtained and correspondingly only classical regular orbits appear in the poincar sections . in the case of a medium",
    "size quantum system ( @xmath36 top panel of fig.[fig14 ] ) , the regular lattice seems to extend until the energy of the _ dynamic _ esqpt ( @xmath4 ) , however a closer view of the same energy region using a larger system ( @xmath37 ) unveils a richer structure in the denser peres lattice : the regular lattice extends beyond the critical energy @xmath4 . for a small interval around @xmath4 ,",
    "regular and irregular lattices coexist . for larger energies",
    "the lattice is completely irregular .",
    "these lattice characteristics are reflected by the respective a - d parameter ( bottom panel of fig.[fig14 ] ) which decrease drastically from large values at energies close to the minimum .",
    "at @xmath38 it attains values around @xmath39 , and finally at an energy @xmath40 it takes values smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "the classical results have a clear correspondence with the quantum ones , as can be verified in the poincar sections of fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] : regular orbits for low energies ( including the critical energy @xmath4 ) , mixed dynamics or soft chaos ( coexistence of regular and chaotic trajectories ) at energies near but above the critical energy @xmath4 , and hard chaos ( chaotic trajectories fulling the whole available phase space ) for energies @xmath42 .",
    "the precursors of the esqpts , both the _ dynamic _ and _ static _ , can be clearly seen in the peres lattice of the @xmath36 system ( top panel of fig.[fig14 ] ) , as a change in the slope of the tendency of the @xmath43 values as the energy is increased .",
    "the last case we present is one with a large coupling , deep in the superradiant phase ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "again , we have a regular region in the low energy sector and a hard chaotic region for higher energies .",
    "as in the previous cases the precursors of the two esqpts are clearly seen in the peres lattice shown in the top panel of fig.[fig16 ] . in the same panel the regular part of the lattice seems to be limited by the critical energy of the _ dynamic _ esqpt ( @xmath4 ) , however a closer view to that energy region for a larger system ( @xmath45 ) unveils a more involved relationship between the esqpt and the transition to chaos . differently to the case shown in the central panel of fig.[fig14 ] ( @xmath46 , for a system size @xmath37 ) , the regular part of the peres lattice in this case ( central panel of fig.[fig16 ] ) does not extend beyond @xmath4 , but it is upper limited by @xmath47 . for low energies",
    "the lattice is completely regular , whereas for energies around @xmath47 a coexistence of regular and irregular patterns is obtained . at the critical energy of",
    "the _ dynamic _ esqpt the lattice seems to be completely irregular , and the same is obtained for larger energies .",
    "the previous qualitative observations are quantitatively reflected by the a - d parameter ( bottom panel of fig.[fig16 ] ) which decrease abruptly in an energy interval around @xmath47 below the value @xmath41 . the classical poincar sections ( fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) present a very similar route to chaos .",
    "for @xmath48 only regular orbits are obtained , whereas for @xmath49 a mixed phase space with regular and chaotic trajectories appears . in a narrow energy interval",
    "the phase space properties change rapidly .",
    "for @xmath50 the chaotic trajectories fill the available phase space , excepting a small stability island , which disappears completely at larger energies .",
    "the peres lattices and the classical results which support and explain the different structures found in them , show that the change from a regular regime to a chaotic one in the dicke model is much more involved that the transitions linked to the dos ( esqpt ) or the ground - state properties ( qpt ) .",
    "while the esqpt and qpt are well defined transitions in the classical limit [ they are unambiguously indicated by non - analytic behavior of the ground - state energy and volume of the available phase space @xmath51 , the transition from a regular regime ( at low energies ) to a chaotic one ( large energies ) can not be unambiguously defined even in the classical limit .",
    "instead continuous changes in the phase space structures are obtained , which include a mixed or soft chaos regime where regular and chaotic patterns coexist , both in the classical and quantum results , and both in the normal and superradiant phases .",
    "nevertheless , an indirect connection between chaos and the esqpt can be obtained through the unstable fixed points of the classical version .",
    "they determine clearly the energies where changes in the available phase space take place , and consequently singular behavior in the classical approximation of the dos , on the other hand they are also involved in the breaking of the quadratic approximation which is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the presence of chaos in the classical model .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the results presented above show that the peres lattices are a very useful tool to explore in a qualitative and quick way the presence of chaos in the quantum models .",
    "moreover , they are useful to give indications about the properties of the corresponding classical model .",
    "the peres lattices allow at a glance to visualize the system properties in the energy space , contrary to the traditional poincar sections which are defined only for a given energy . with the peres",
    "lattices it is easy to select individual states and identify if they are part of the regular or chaotic lattice part . in this sense",
    "they can be useful to perform more detailed studies about the classical and quantum correspondence such as the work of ref.@xcite , where the husimi functions of selected eigenstates are calculated and compared with the classical results .",
    "as in the present study , in that ref .",
    "a clear quantum - classical correspondence is obtained for systems with sizes of order @xmath52 .",
    "using both a semiclassical analysis and results of an efficient numerical procedure to diagonalize the quantum hamiltonians , we have studied the dicke and tc models in the space of coupling and energy .",
    "we focused on the onset of chaos in the non - integrable dicke model , one of the global properties of the energy - coupling space .",
    "we explore the properties of the quantum and classical models as a function of coupling and energy with regard to the onset of irregular patterns .",
    "poincar surface sections and peres lattices were used , respectively , for the classical and quantum versions .",
    "a clear classical and quantum global correspondence was obtained for system sizes ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath1 .    through the unstable fixed points ,",
    "an indirect connection between the esqpt s and the onset of chaos was identified , however , the latter is a much richer phenomenon than the occurrence of non - analytic behavior in the density of states or the ground - state energy .",
    "it was found that the onset of chaos is related with the breaking of the quadratic approximation of the hamiltonian that is obtained by considering small oscillations around the global energy minimum .",
    "it was confirmed in the quantum and classical versions , that chaos is present , both in the normal and superradiant phase , for large enough energies , except in the perturbative regime @xmath54 .",
    "conversely , for any coupling there always exist an energy interval above the energy minimum where only regular patterns are obtained .",
    "in particular for the very small coupling regime @xmath54 this energy interval extends to infinity .",
    "once the quadratic approximation is broken more energy is needed to produce chaotic patterns , something that can be clearly seen in the classical system with critical coupling , where one of the normal modes of the quadratic approximation is exactly zero , which implies that terms of order larger than two have to be considered .",
    "even so , the system presents regular patterns in the low energy regime , and irregular trajectories appears until larger energies .",
    "the peres lattices used to study the quantum versions were a very useful tool to identify qualitatively the chaotic and regular features of the spectrum , moreover they show clear signatures of the esqpts .",
    "the qualitative information provided by the peres lattices was quantitatively confirmed by analyzing the statistical properties of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "it was tested if the fluctuations of spectrum in different energy intervals follow the wigner distribution characteristic of the hard chaotic systems .",
    "the classical analysis performed in this contribution allows us to gain many insights about the results obtained in the quantum versions .",
    "for instance , it was shown that the two modes approximation obtained in @xcite by making a holstein - primakhof of the pseudospin variables in the quantum model , is valid in the thermodynamic ( equivalent here to the semi - classical ) limit , but only for an energy region immediately above the ground - state energy . moreover",
    ", the two modes approximation explains very well the regular patterns found in the low lying energy spectrum of the finite quantum dicke model",
    ".    this global study may be useful as a navigation chart to more detailed studies that focus on the classical - quantum correspondence of single states , such as that performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally , the results presented here for optical models confirm results of previous studies , performed in the context of nuclear physics simple models @xcite , about the classical and quantum correspondence with regard to the onset of chaos in the extended energy and coupling space .",
    "we thank p. strnsky and p. cejnar for many useful and interesting conversations.this work was partially supported by conacyt- mxico , dgapa - unam and dgdaeia - uv through the `` 2013 internal call for strengthening academic groups '' ( uv - ca-320 ) .",
    "if small oscillations around the energy minimum are considered , a quadratic hamiltonian is obtained whose normal frequencies @xmath55 give the low lying energy spectrum of the quantum model with excitation energies @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . for couplings below the critical value",
    "the normal modes of the low energy regime can be obtained by expanding the classical hamiltonian ( [ diham ] ) around the global minimum @xmath58 .",
    "this expansion is easily obtained by transforming @xcite the angular momentum canonical variables ( @xmath59 and @xmath30 ) to @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in terms of these variables the classical hamiltonian ( [ diham ] ) of the dicke model ( @xmath62 ) , reads @xmath63 by expanding the square root in the previous hamiltonian , we obtain , to leading order , a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath64 with normal frequencies @xcite given by @xmath65    for couplings larger than the critical one , two degenerate minima emerge , and the expansion has to be taken around these new minima ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) given by eq.(12 ) in the companion paper ( i ) .",

    ", we have to separate the energy eigenstates according to their parity ( @xmath20 ) . to this end",
    ", we construct a basis which is also an eigenbasis of the parity operator .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath82 this result shows that the states ( [ cohbas ] ) are proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "it can be shown ( see @xcite ) that the action of the rotation operator @xmath84 over @xmath79 gives @xmath85 therefore we have @xmath86 on the other hand , by using the properties of the coherent states , it is straightforward to show that @xmath87 . with the previous result",
