    "the influence of environmental degrees of freedom has been identified as the key concept in explaining the classical behavior of macroscopic systems in a quantum framework @xcite . according to this notion a preferred set of localized system states  called the pointer basis @xcite ",
    "is induced in the course of the interaction of the system with its surrounding .",
    "most characteristically , any initial superposition of these pointer states gets rapidly mixed , while the only states who retain their purity for a long time are the pointer states themselves .",
    "while the basic ideas behind the decoherence process seems to be settled , it still remains an open problem to understand the emergence , the dynamics , and the main properties of the pointer states for microscopic realistic environments .",
    "several strategies have been proposed so far for determining the pointer basis given the environmental coupling .",
    "in @xcite the suggestion was made to sort all pure states in the hilbert space according to their linear entropy production rate .",
    "the pointer states are then identified with the states having minimal loss of purity .",
    "similar results are obtained by the approach of @xcite which is based on a time evolution equation whose solitonic solutions are identified with the pointer states .",
    "so far , this concept has been applied to the damped harmonic oscillator @xcite and to a free quantum particle coupled linearly to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite . there , the solitonic solutions of the corresponding nonlinear equation are coherent states and gaussian wave packets , respectively .",
    "moreover , the decoherence to gaussian pointer states was proved to be generic for linear coupling models @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the analysis from linear models to a non - perturbative treatment of the interaction .",
    "we focus on the model of collisional decoherence , which provides a realistic description of the decoherence process generated by an ideal gas environment .",
    "notably , experiments with interfering fullerene molecules displayed a reduction of interference visibility in agreement with this model @xcite .",
    "we derive the corresponding pointer states which are shown to form an overcomplete , exponentially localized set of basis states , and we prove decoherence to these states using the orthogonal unraveling of the master equation @xcite . this stochastic process on the one hand provides the statistical weights of the pointer basis , and on the other hand represents an efficient way of solving master equations which exhibit pointer states .",
    "moreover , it explains the emergence of classical hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the main result was already announced in @xcite . here , we provide a more detailed explanation of the proofs and derivations . as an extension of @xcite , we prove the decoherence dynamics for a more general situation where the localization rate of collisional decoherence is in a non - saturated regime , and we utilize the relative entropy in order to illustrate the emergence of the statistical weights .",
    "while the above results are derived within the framework of decoherence theory , they can also be applied to dynamic reduction models which propose a modification of the schrdinger equation by means of nonlinear and stochastic terms .",
    "in fact , the observational consequences of the ghirardi - rimini - weber ( grw ) spontaneous localization model @xcite are equivalent to the ones of collisional decoherence , since they are described by the same master equation @xcite .",
    "the present work therefore applies to the grw model . in particular",
    ", it provides the corresponding pointer basis .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in sect .  2 ,",
    "we briefly review the notion of pointer states , and we summarize the method for determining the pointer states discussed in @xcite . in order to motivate the approach",
    ", we consider a two level system and a dephasing process .",
    "this method is then applied to collisional decoherence in sect .  3 , which provides a set of solitonic states to be regarded as ` candidate ' pointer states .",
    "we show in sect .",
    "4 that these solitons form an overcomplete basis of exponentially localized states , and we give an expression for their spatial extension .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the ` candidate ' pointer states move on classical phase space trajectories if they are sufficiently localized . in sect .  5 , we briefly review the method of quantum trajectories , focusing in particular on the orthogonal unraveling of the master equation .",
    "this stochastic process is then applied to collisional decoherence which allows us to show that the ` candidate ' states are indeed pointer states in the sense of the definition given in sect .  2 .",
    "furthermore , we use the orthogonal unraveling to show that the statistical weights of the pointer states are given by the overlap with the initial state .",
    "we present our conclusion in section 6 .",
    "to motivate the definition of pointer states , let us consider the quantum dynamics of the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "its evolution can be described by a master equation in lindblad form defined by the standard hamiltonian @xmath0 , and a single lindblad operator @xmath1 , with associated rate @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we take as initial state a superposition of two quasi - orthogonal coherent states @xmath3 which satisfy @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "it is then easy to show that for times larger than the decoherence time @xmath6 the solution of the master equation is well approximated by @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "thus , any coherent state remains pure during the damped time evolution , while any superposition of distinct coherent states decays into a mixture ( with a decay rate @xmath9 ) whose statistical weights are determined by the initial overlaps @xmath10 and @xmath11 . due to this property ,",
    "the coherent states are to be identified with the pointer states of the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the above observation serves as the starting point for the following definition of the pointer states for an open quantum system evolving according to a lindblad master equation @xmath12 .",
    "one says that the system exhibits a pointer basis if its dynamics involves a separation of time scales , characterized by a fast decoherence time @xmath13 , such that for any time much larger than @xmath13 , the evolved state is well approximated by a mixture of uniquely defined pure states @xmath14 which are independent of the initial state @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "following the above example , we further demand that for initial states @xmath15 , which are superpositions of mutually orthogonal pointer states @xmath18 , the probability distribution @xmath19 is given by the initial projections @xmath20 the pointer states @xmath21 initially form an ( overcomplete ) basis , and they may evolve in time , though slowly compared to @xmath13 .    the name _ pointer state _ was coined in @xcite due to its relevance for the physical description of a measurement apparatus . a measurement device which probes an observable @xmath22",
    "is constructed such that macroscopically distinct positions of the pointer or indicator are obtained for the different eigenstates of @xmath22 . for a quantum system initially prepared in an eigenstate of @xmath22",
    "the read - out will display the corresponding eigenvalue with certainty provided these pointer states remain pure during the time evolution . on the other hand , if the quantum system is prepared in a superposition of eigenstates of @xmath22 , we expect the pointer not to end up in a superposition of different read - out states , but rather to be at a definite position , though probabilistically , with probabilities given by the overlap ( [ eq : bornrule ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the importance of pointer states goes beyond the physics of measurement devices and the quantum - to - classical transition since they are also a practical tool for the solution of master equations . knowing the pointer states @xmath21 , their time evolution @xmath23 , and their probabilities @xmath24",
    ", one can immediately specify the solution of the master equation for any initial state and times greater than the decoherence time .",
    "since the decoherence time is generically much shorter than the system and dissipation time scales of the pointer state motion , this allows one to capture a large part of the system evolution without solving the master equation .      a practical way to obtain the pointer states @xmath21 , for a given environmental coupling ,",
    "was discussed in @xcite .",

    "since the solution of the master equation will not be at hand in general , one requires a method which yields the pointer states without the knowledge of @xmath40 . to motivate this",
    ", we notice that the north pole of the bloch sphere is the asymptotic end point of the trajectory illustrated by the thick line in fig .  1 .",
    "this trajectory is generated by an equation of motion with the following properties .",

    "( _ ii _ ) it preserves the purity of pure initial states , i.e. an initial state which lies on the bloch sphere remains on the surface .",
    "( _ iii _ ) the generated trajectory follows the exact solution of the master equation as close as possible . in order to find such an equation of motion ,",
    "it is suggestive to minimize the distance of the initial increments , i.e. @xmath41 here , @xmath42 denotes the generator of the master equation ( [ eq : dephasing ] ) in bloch representation and @xmath43 is subject to the condition that the generated trajectory remains on the surface of the bloch sphere .",

    "this property ( which does not hold for @xmath339 ) makes the stochastic process analytically tractable , not least because the dynamics is independent of the phases of the coefficients .",
    "since the deterministic part ( [ eq : coefficients ] ) of the evolution is monotonic for @xmath340 , a trajectory starting from @xmath341 will end up in the state @xmath342 if and only if an odd number of jumps occurs in the process .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "crucially , the jump rate @xmath343 , @xmath344 is unaffected by the jump ( [ eq : averagejump ] ) at all times , since it is invariant under interchanging the coefficients .",
    "hence , the time dependence of the jump rate is identical for all trajectories , which , in turn , means that the number of jumps follows an inhomogeneous poisson process .",
    "therefore , the probability for an odd number of jumps , which is equal to the statistical weight @xmath345 of the pointer state @xmath346 , is given by @xmath347 with @xmath348 the integrated jump rate .",

    "the stochastic process is much more involved if the initial superposition consists of more than two pointer states .",
    "our numerical implementation of the stochastic process defined by ( [ eq : coefficients ] ) , ( [ eq : process2 ] ) and ( [ eq : process3 ] ) is based on a metropolis - hastings algorithm to draw the momentum transfer @xmath65 in accordance with the rate ( [ eq : process3 ] ) , with @xmath147 a gaussian . each of the generated trajectories ends asymptotically in one of the fixed points corresponding to a pointer state , and we thus obtain a numerical estimate of the statistical weights by means of the relative frequencies @xmath352 , of the asymptotic states . to confirm the expected probability distribution @xmath353 , we evaluate the relative entropy @xmath354 between these two distributions .",
