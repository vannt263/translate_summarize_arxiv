    ", we study josephson effect in superconductor - semiconductor nanowire - superconductor heterostructure ( sc - sm - sc ) shown in fig  [ fig : junction]a .",
    "the system consists of a semiconductor nanowire with strong rashba spin - orbit coupling(soc ) subject to a large in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the wire is connected to the superconducting leads as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : junction]a .",
    "when chemical potential is in the gap , see fig .",
    "[ fig : junction]b , there is only one fermi surface  @xcite . coherent transport through the nanowire in the helical phase , which originates from the non - trivial interplay between large zeeman splitting and strong rashba soc , have not been previously explored  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the josephson effect  @xcite considered the case of either small zeeman field or small soc whereas we are interested in a non - perturbative limit where _ both _ zeeman and so terms are large leading to a significant change of the nanowire bandstructure .",
    "such heterostructures involving semiconductor nanowires and s - wave superconductors exhibit a number of interesting effects and , in particular , are very promising for realizing topological superconducting phase hosting majorana zero - energy modes  @xcite .",
    "we note that the present setup is different from the one in ref .",
    "[ ] leading to @xmath0 ac josephson effect because the sc parts are topologically trivial and there are no majorana bound states .    in this paper , we develop a quantitative theory for the coherent transport through the nanowire in the clean limit by employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "the supercurrent through the nanowire in the short - constriction limit  @xcite is mainly transmitted by the discrete electron - hole states ( andreev bound states ) confined in the nanowire .",
    "these bound states appear because an electron incident on the semiconductor / superconductor interface is andreev reflected as a hole with the opposite spin and momentum . to understand how zeeman splitting and spin - orbit coupling affect andreev bound states , it is instructive to consider two limiting cases : ( a ) magnetic - field - dominated regime where zeeman splitting @xmath1 is much larger than the spin - orbit coupling @xmath2 . in this regime , propagating electron and hole modes are spin - polarized , and , thus , andreev reflection is suppressed .",
    "( b ) spin - orbit dominated regime @xmath3 . in this case , the propagating electron and hole have helical character and andreev bound states can be formed by the helical electrons .",
    "the intuition developed for the these two limits allows one to understand the general case of both strong zeeman and so couplings .",
    "we first consider short - junction limit and show that the helical phase in the semiconductor nanowires can be identified by a sharp decrease of the supercurrent as one increases an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "we also consider here long - junction limit and show that our findings persists in this case as well .",
    "to have a better understanding of the josephson transport in realistic situations , we consider the andreev spectrum in disordered nanowires and calculate local density of states ( ldos ) which can be probed in tunneling experiments .",
    "it is generally found that disorder smears out the peaks in the local density of states corresponding to the andreev bound states and reduces transmission probability .",
    "however , we also show that magnetic field induced zero - energy crossings generically appearing in andreev spectrum are robust against moderate disorder .",
    "this phenomenon appears when andreev energy levels are non - degenerate due to the combination of spin - orbit and zeeman couplings and is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry which constraints certain matrix elements between a pair of zero - energy states at an isolated crossing .",
    "thus , we predict that in this regime there will be generically zero - bias peaks in tunneling conductance as a function of the superconducting phase difference across the junction .",

    "the phase with only one fermi surface is called `` helical '' because the motion of an electron and its spin are correlated .",

    "we consider first the case of a large zeeman splitting @xmath47 , and show that the josephson current exhibits two remarkable features depending on the value of the chemical potential : in the non - helical regime @xmath48 , supercurrent exhibits oscillations with the applied magnetic field whereas in the helical phase @xmath49 the supercurrent is significantly suppressed .",

    "the energy spectrum and the position of the crossings can be understood from the doubly - degenerate andreev spectrum without any zeeman field @xmath66 , with zero - energy crossing at @xmath67 .",
    "the zeeman field splits the degeneracy and the zero - energy crossings move away from @xmath15 by an amount @xmath68 .",
    "note that zero - energy crossings are not robust and appear due to our assumption of perfect interface transparency @xmath69 .",
    "in realistic conditions @xmath70 , and zero - energy crossings will become avoided crossings corresponding to the local minima of the energy spectrum and therefore vanishing of the josephson current , which are accompanied with the sign reversal of the supercurrent  @xcite , see fig.[fig : phase ] .    the physical origin of the phase shift @xmath68 can be understood quasi - classically from the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition .",
    "indeed , andreev bound states can only form when the total phase acquired by the electron undergoing two andreev reflections is quantized : @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the total scattering phase acquired by the electron ( hole ) at the interfaces and @xmath73 .",
    "the latter agrees perfectly with the scattering matrix calculation .",
    "as follows from this analysis , the josephson current in the limit of @xmath59 should oscillate with the zeeman field @xmath1 with period which is proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "similar oscillations of the critical current have been found in sc - ferromagnet - sc junction  @xcite .    in the polarized limit",
    "( @xmath75 ) , the propagation of the spin - up electrons in the nanowire is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the calculation of the josephson current in this limit yields the following result : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , if the length of the wire @xmath79 , the supercurrent through the nanowire will be significantly suppressed .",
    "this result is strictly speaking only valid when @xmath50 as the presence of spin - orbit coupling leads to spin flips .",
    "however , the probability for the spin flips to occur within the distance @xmath80 is small because @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the suppression of the supercurrent in the helical phase should be observable even in the presence of the small soc as we explicitly demonstrate below .",
    "we now discuss josephson effect in the case of small zeeman splitting @xmath82 .",
    "the effect of magnetic field is perturbative here and we begin with @xmath83 limit . without any loss of generality , we can choose the direction of the spin - orbit coupling to be along @xmath84-axis .",
    "the s - wave superconductor is spin-@xmath85 invariant .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian for the nanowire reads @xmath86 the energy spectrum for spin - up(-down ) electrons is shifted to the right ( left ) . assuming that the chemical potential @xmath87 , we can write down the wavefunction in the nanowire as @xmath88 here @xmath89 are defined as @xmath90    matching the boundary conditions at @xmath91 , we find the normal state scattering matrix to be @xmath92 here @xmath93 and @xmath54 is the fermi momentum in the normal leads .",

    "andreev levels are doubly degenerate due to the presence of the time - reversal symmetry as well as the approximation @xmath97 used here .",
    "the small corrections to the spectrum due to the presence of the spin - orbit coupling were considered in refs .",
    "the main effect of spin - orbit coupling here is actually the modification of the fermi momenta which affects normal reflection and thus the josephson current due to the mismatch of the fermi momenta in the nanowire and superconductor . for special values of @xmath33 satisfying the resonance condition @xmath98 ,",
    "transmission of electrons through the spin - orbit coupled wire becomes perfect and the supercurrent is the same as in the absence of soc .",
    "we now turn to the general case when both so and zeeman terms are large .",
    "we can develop some intuition by considering andreev reflection in terms of the eigenstates @xmath99 of the hamiltonian . from the discussion of the zeeman - dominated regime",
    ", we recall that there are two major consequences caused by zeeman polarization : ( a ) the oscillation of the critical current with @xmath1 and @xmath33 .",
    "( b ) significant suppression of the critical current when @xmath100 .",
    "however , the spin - orbit interaction causes precession of the spin of electrons / holes within the characteristic length scale @xmath101 , which tends to wash out the spin polarization of electrons and holes . to this end , it is instructive to rewrite the s - wave pairing in the chiral basis : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 . thus , both inter - band and intra - band pairing are generated in the chiral basis . therefore , one expects that andreev scattering at the n - s boundary has qualitatively similar behavior , i.e. there is both inter- and intra - band scattering .",
    "we can understand our analytical results in the two limiting cases as follows : first in the zeeman - dominated regime inter - band scattering dominates over intra - band scattering .",
    "once the @xmath105 band is gapped , quasiparticles in this band can not propagate in the junction whose length is much larger than the length scale associated with the zeeman gap .",
    "therefore , the supercurrent will be suppressed , similar to the spin - polarized case discussed above . in the opposite regime @xmath106 ,",
    "the andreev reflection is dominated by the intra - band scattering and the situation is similar to the soc - dominated regime where there is no abrupt change in the josephson current across the boundary @xmath107 .",
    "the discussion above provides some intuition about andreev reflection .",
    "however , in order to understand the coherent transport quantitatively , one needs to consider also normal reflection at the sc - sm interface",
    ". this can be done by appropriately matching the boundary conditions and finding the corresponding scattering matrix @xmath108 as described in the appendix .",
    "the expression of josephson current in the general case is not particularly enlightening and we present here numerical results instead .",

    ", we need to decouple the phase dependence of the josephson current which is non - trivial , especially around @xmath120 .",

    "other perturbations , such as on - site disorder , also take the form @xmath192 combining the two contributions , we find that the spectrum now reads @xmath193 therefore , the perturbation shifts the crossing point @xmath194 . if the perturbation is strong enough , then the two crossings located at different @xmath195 are brought close to each other and can annihilate each other since these perturbations can now mix the states corresponding to different crossings and , thus , can generically open a gap in the spectrum .",
    "however , such a perturbation needs to be larger than certain threshold which explains why zero - energy crossings survive in the presence of a moderate disorder .",
    "we have developed a theory for the coherent transport through semiconductor nanowire with strong spin - orbit coupling and zeeman splitting .",
    "we find a number of remarkable features in the josephson current through the nanowire originating from the interplay between two competing terms : spin - orbit coupling and zeeman splitting .",
    "in particular , we show that the transition between helical and non - helical states of the nanowire is accompanied by a large suppression of the critical current through the junction when zeeman energy is large compared to the spin - orbit energy scale .",
    "we support these findings by calculating the josephson current both in the short - junction limit using scattering matrix formalism and in the long - junction case using the numerical diagonalization .",
    "the suppression of the critical current can be used as a diagnostic of the helical state in the nanowire .",
    "we also show that the critical current exhibits oscillations with an applied magnetic field .",

    "we also compute local density of states and study effect of disorder on the andreev energy spectrum . without an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the disorder - averaged local density of states is qualitatively similar to that of the clean case - the disorder mainly changes the junction transparency . in the presence of a magnetic field removing spin - degeneracy of the andreev energy spectrum",
    ", we find zero - energy crossings which are robust against moderate disorder .",
    "we explain this robustness by invoking general arguments based on particle - hole symmetry and show analytically that any on - site perturbation only shifts the position of an isolated zero - energy crossing but does not open a gap in the spectrum .",

    "we now briefly outline the derivation of the particle component of the scattering matrix @xmath196 .",
    "the system we consider here consists of the semiconductor nanowire @xmath197 coupled to the superconducting electrodes at @xmath91 .",
    "the particles propagate freely within the nanowire @xmath197 in the presence of a finite spin - orbit coupling and zeeman field ( i.e. @xmath198 ) . for technical reasons ,",
    "we insert thin ballistic normal leads to the left and right of the semiconducting nanowire  @xcite .",
    "we then calculate particle ( electron ) scattering matrix by considering n - sm - n system where the scattering at the sm - n interface occurs , for example , due to the mismatch of the fermi momenta .",
    "the scattering at the n - sc interface is assumed to be ideal(i.e .",
    "normal reflection - free ) consisting of andreev reflection at the sc - n interface .",
    "this spatial separation allows one to substantially simplify the problem and relate supercurrent to the normal - state scattering matrix .",
    "let us first construct a basis for the particle component of the total scattering matrix .",
    "the wave incident on the nanowire corresponds to a vector : @xmath199 the corresponding outgoing wave is given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 correspond to right / left - moving quasiparticles with spin @xmath202 in the normal region at the left boundary .",
    "the normal scattering matrix is defined as @xmath203 .",
    "the wavefunction in the n - sm - n system is given by    @xmath204    here @xmath205 where @xmath131 is the chemical potential in the normal metal .",
    "the spinor wavefunction @xmath206 and @xmath207 are given by @xmath208 here @xmath209 .    at the right",
    "/ left boundaries @xmath91 , the wavefunction and the probability current have to be continuous .",
    "for example , at @xmath210 we have the following boundary conditions : @xmath211 matching the boundary conditions yields a system of equations for @xmath212 .",
    "for example , at @xmath213 we find    @xmath214    here @xmath215 .",
    "the equations at @xmath210 are similar . eliminating @xmath216",
    ", we obtain the particle scattering matrix @xmath217 .",
    "using the particle - hole symmetry of the bdg equations one can obtain @xmath218 and compute the spectrum of andreev levels using eq.(5 ) of the main text .",
    "in the calculation of the josephson current , we have made two approximations : ( 1 ) we assumed that the josephson current is dominated by the andreev bound states in the junction ( i.e. short - junction limit ) , and neglected the contribution of the continuum states .",
    "( 2 ) in evaluating the andreev spectrum we have neglected the energy dependence of the normal state scattering matrix : @xmath97 . in this section",
    "we examine the validity of the second approximation .",
    "we start with the case @xmath50 and show that such approximation is justified apart from the points close to @xmath219 .",

    "when @xmath233 , we can disregard this term and the short - junction approximation is justified .    however , in some cases that even for small @xmath234 this correction can result in a qualitatively different dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider the spectrum of andreev levels at @xmath235 .",
    "since the time - reversal symmetry of the system is broken by the zeeman term , we expect the andreev levels to be split .",
    "however , if we start with the approximation of @xmath97 , we find @xmath236 which gives in the limit of @xmath237 the energy splitting quadratic in @xmath1 : @xmath238 however , this scaling is qualitatively different if we include the energy dependence . indeed , assuming @xmath239 , we find that @xmath240 as one would expect from qualitative considerations .",
    "thus , apart from the points @xmath241 , the approximation @xmath97 gives qualitatively correct results .",
    "let us now discuss the case with a finite soc .",
    "generally , one has to rely on numerical solution but under the assumption that both @xmath242 and @xmath1 are small with respect to @xmath131 , we obtain the following analytical equation for the andreev levels , which agrees with the one derived in ref .  [ ] : @xmath243+n\\pi .",
