    "in the standard model of low - mass star formation , molecular clouds have an initially subcritical mass - to - flux ratio , and spend a relatively long time ( @xmath2 years ) undergoing quasi - static fragmentation by ambipolar diffusion until cores come to be supercritical .",

    "this scenario is supported by the observed relatively low efficiency of star formation in molecular clouds , i.e. , only @xmath4 for clouds as a whole but several times greater within cluster - forming cores ( see * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative model is that star formation begins in clouds with supercritical mass - to - flux ratio that have additional support due to turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model",
    ", star formation occurs relatively rapidly , as turbulence dissipates over a dynamical timescale , and the large - scale magnetic field plays a minor role .",
    "the rapid star formation model is supported by the observational results that the age spreads of young stars in nearby molecular clouds are often a few @xmath5 years @xcite , and the low fraction of clouds that are observed to be in a pre - star - formation state .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have modeled mildly subcritical clouds and shown that the timescale of cloud fragmentation is reduced by supersonic turbulence .",
    "they showed this by performing two - dimensional simulations in the thin - disk approximation .",
    "such a model can explain both relatively rapid star formation and the relatively low star formation efficiency in molecular clouds that is not well explained if star formation starts from a supercritical cloud . in this letter , we study the three - dimensional extension of the @xcite model , by including a self - consistent calculation of the vertical structure and dynamics of the cloud .",
    "we confirm that supersonic flows can significantly shorten the timescale of core formation in three - dimensional subcritical clouds , and clarify how the scaling of various physical quantities allows this to occur .",
    "we solve the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations including self - gravity and ambipolar diffusion , assuming that neutrals are much more numerous than ions .",
    "instead of solving a detailed energy equation , we assume isothermality for each lagrangian fluid particle @xcite . for the neutral - ion collision time and associated quantities , we follow @xcite .",
    "the basic equations are summarized in kboy .    as an initial condition",
    ", we assume hydrostatic equilibrium of a self - gravitating one - dimensional cloud along the @xmath6-direction in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath7 .",
    "though nearly isothermal , a molecular cloud is usually surrounded by warm material , such as neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "hence , we assume that the initial sound speed makes a transition from a low value @xmath8 to a high value @xmath9 at a distance @xmath10 , with a transition length @xmath11 ( see eq .",

    "we take @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , where @xmath8 is the initial sound speed at @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the initial density at @xmath15 .",
    "a numerical solution for the initial density distribution shows that it is almost the same as the @xcite solution for an equilibrium isothermal layer in the region @xmath18 .",

    "dimensional values of all quantities can be found through a choice of @xmath17 and @xmath8 .",

    "a collapsing core is located in the vicinity of @xmath66 .",
    "the size of the core is similar to that created by linear initial perturbations ( see fig . 2 in kboy ) , although the shape is notably less circular .",

    "the @xmath67-velocities show infall motion toward the center of the core , although the core itself is moving with nonzero negative @xmath67-velocity .",
    "the relative infall speed to the core is subsonic and about @xmath69 .",
    "it is comparable to the case of initial linear perturbation ( see fig . 9 in kboy ) .",
    "however , there are systematic motions throughout the simulation region that are still supersonic at this time , even though the initial turbulent energy has decayed somewhat .",
    "this is qualitatively distinct from the corresponding case with linear perturbations , and should be observationally testable . for the single core that is formed in this simulation ,",
    "the systematic core motion is about @xmath70 in the @xmath67-direction .",
    "however , it can be even larger in other realizations .",
    "the ion velocity @xmath71 can be related to the neutral velocity @xmath72 and the magnetic acceleration @xmath73 in the assumed limit of low ion inertia by the relation @xmath74 figure 3 reveals that the ion infall motions are smaller in magnitude than the neutral motions due to the retarding magnetic acceleration ; however the relative drift in the @xmath67-direction between ions and neutrals is typically within @xmath75 . in order to see the force balance in the core , we plot the @xmath67-accelerations in the bottom panel of figure 3 along the same @xmath67-axis as the top panel .",
    "these values are normalized by the computational units .",

    "the @xmath6-velocities also show infall motion toward the center of the core .",
    "the relative neutral infall speed to the core is also subsonic and about @xmath81 .",
    "the ion velocity in the vertical direction is almost identical to the neutral velocity but actually very slightly _ greater _ in magnitude at the peak .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 4 shows the @xmath6-accelerations along the same @xmath6-axis as in the top panel . in the @xmath6-direction , @xmath76 is nearly balanced by @xmath78 , and @xmath77 is almost negligible , _ but working in the same direction as gravity_. the net acceleration ( @xmath79 ) is also working toward the center of the core .",
    "the inward pointing vertical magnetic acceleration associated with an hourglass - type magnetic field morphology explains why the ion velocity in the @xmath6-direction is greater in magnitude than the neutral velocity .",
    "our three - dimensional mhd simulations have shown that the supersonic nonlinear flows significantly reduce the timescale of collapsing core formation in subcritical clouds .",
    "it is of order several @xmath5 years for typical parameters , or @xmath82 times less than found in the linear initial perturbation studies of @xcite , @xcite , and kboy .",
    "our supersonic perturbations are also trans - alfvnic , in agreement with analysis of observed magnetic field strengths @xcite .",
    "it is also in line with the theoretical result of @xcite that turbulent clouds will settle into a trans - alfvnic state when global motion / expansion is allowed , even if driven with turbulence that is initially super - alfvnic .    to see how accelerated ambipolar diffusion can occur",
    ", we note that the magnetic induction equation ( see , e.g. , eq . 3 of kboy ) and",
    "our assumptions of ionization balance can be used to estimate the diffusion time @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the gradient length scale introduced by the initial turbulent compression and @xmath85 is the magnetic field strength . because the compression by the nonlinear flow is nearly one - dimensional , the magnetic field scales roughly as @xmath86 within the flux freezing approximation . if the compression is rapid enough that vertical hydrostatic equilibrium can not be established ( unlike in previous calculations using the thin - disk approximation ) , then @xmath87 as well ( i.e. , one - dimensional contraction without vertical settling ) , and @xmath88 .",
    "this means that diffusion can occur quickly ( and lead to a rapidly rising value of @xmath56 ) if the turbulent compression creates small values of @xmath84 .",
    "if diffusion is so effective during the first turbulent compression that a dense region becomes magnetically supercritical , then it will evolve directly into collapse .",
    "alternately , the stored magnetic energy of the compressed ( and still subcritical ) region may lead to a reexpansion of the dense region .",
    "the timescale for this , in the flux - freezing limit , is the alfvn time @xmath89 , which scales @xmath90 for the above conditions .",
    "thus , @xmath91 decreases more rapidly than @xmath92 , and sufficiently small turbulent - generated values of @xmath84 may lead to enough magnetic diffusion that collapse occurs before any reexpansion can occur .",
    "see @xcite for some similar discussion along these lines . ultimately , whether or not reexpansion of the first compression can occur depends on the strength of the turbulent compression , mass - to - flux ratio of the initial cloud , and neutral - ion collision time . in a preliminary study of such effects , we found that keeping @xmath47 and @xmath24 fixed but allowing significantly poorer or stronger neutral - ion coupling yielded differing results .",
    "for @xmath93 ( poorer coupling ) , a collapsing core formed due to the first compression , at @xmath94 , while for @xmath95 it happened after more oscillations than in our standard model , at @xmath96 . a full parameter study will be required to elucidate .",
    "if reexpansion of the initial compression does occur , as in the standard model presented in this paper , then there is enough time for the vertical structure to settle back to near - hydrostatic equilibrium , in which case @xmath97 . since the compressed and reexpanded region executes oscillations about a new mean density , it is convenient to analyze the scalings in terms of the density @xmath98 .",
    "the diffusion time now scales as @xmath99 .",
    "this yields a scaling of @xmath91 that is the traditionally used one ( and is satisfied by design in the thin - disk approximation ) .",
    "however , the diffusion occurs more rapidly than it would in the initial state due to the elevated value of @xmath98 in the compressed but oscillating region ( see figure 1 ) ."
