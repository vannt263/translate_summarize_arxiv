    "recent experiments on quantum wires and carbon nanotubes @xcite have stimulated a lot of interest in the transport properties of one - dimensional conductors . from a theoretical point of view , interacting electrons in one dimension form the so - called luttinger liquid @xcite , whose properties qualitatively differ from the conventional fermi liquid state .",
    "recent progress in fabrication techniques has made possible the experimental observation of various characteristic signatures of the luttinger liquid , such as the power - law behavior of the tunneling density of states @xcite , or the existence of separate spin and charge excitations @xcite .",
    "it is also expected , within the luttinger liquid theory , that the dc conductance of a quantum wire connected to fermi liquid leads is given by the quantum of conductance @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this quantization of the conductance has been reported in various experimental setups since its first observation in a quantum point contact @xcite .",
    "however , in a number of recent experiments @xcite , significant deviations from perfect quantization have been observed in the regime of low electron density .",
    "these deviations take the form of a shoulder - like structure below the first plateau of conductance .",
    "although weak at the lowest temperatures available , this feature becomes more significant as the temperature increases , turning into a quasi - plateau at about @xmath1 .",
    "this so - called `` 0.7 structure '' , which is not expected in the luttinger liquid theory , generated much theoretical interest , though there is at present no generally accepted microscopic theory .",
    "most commonly , the experimental results are interpreted as originating from a spin - dependent mechanism .",
    "such scenarios rely on a spontaneous spin polarization of the wire @xcite , or on the existence of a local spin - degenerate quasi - bound state whose screening would lead to kondo - like effects @xcite . other proposals considered various scattering mechanisms involving plasmons @xcite , spin waves @xcite or phonons @xcite .",
    "several authors have also suggested that electron - electron interactions may affect the transport properties in quantum wire devices in a way that would be consistent with the `` 0.7 structure '' @xcite .    in this context , a number of recent theory papers studied the electronic transport in a quantum wire modeled as a one - dimensional system in which the interactions are limited to a small region between two non - interacting leads .",
    "they concluded that the backscattering of either single electrons or pairs were the only mechanisms to significantly affect the transport properties of the system @xcite , but only if the size of the interacting region is comparable to the fermi wavelength of the electrons in the wire .",
    "if , on the other hand , the interaction strength varies smoothly over a much larger distance , such backscattering processes only lead to exponentially small contributions which can be neglected . using the model of a non - uniform luttinger liquid with position - dependent parameters , it was found that no correction to the quantized conductance of the wire arises in this regime @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that even when the backscattering processes can be ignored , the non - uniformity of the interaction potential throughout the wire leads to a finite resistivity at non - zero temperatures .",
    "indeed , the inhomogeneity of the interaction potential breaks the translational invariance of the system , allowing for two - particle scattering processes that conserve energy but not momentum . in",
    ", we qualitatively show how some of these processes give rise to a finite resistivity and perform the corresponding calculation in . in",
    ", we present an alternative derivation of the resistivity in the language of the inhomogeneous luttinger liquid model , allowing us to compare our results with previous works relying on this formalism @xcite .",
    "finally , in we discuss the relation of our results to the experiments probing the transport properties of inhomogeneous quantum wires .",
    "a brief summary of some of our results was reported in @xcite .",
    "let us consider an infinite one - dimensional system of weakly interacting electrons with a quadratic dispersion @xmath2 . to develop a qualitative picture of the physics involved",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the simple model of spinless electrons , with a uniform density @xmath3 throughout the device .",
    "( we will tackle more realistic systems in the next section . )",
    "the inhomogeneity of the system comes from the electron - electron interaction whose strength varies smoothly along the wire .",
    "when one enforces a dc current @xmath4 to flow through the device , the electrons start moving and acquire a drift velocity @xmath5 proportional to this applied current : @xmath6 . in the reference frame",
    "moving with velocity @xmath5 along the wire , the electronic subsystem is in an equilibrium state characterized by a fermi energy @xmath7 and a temperature @xmath8 .",
    "this was recently pointed out @xcite in the context of coulomb drag between two parallel wires .    as we are interested in the low - energy properties of the system , we focus on temperatures @xmath9 , so that the only relevant excitations are close to the fermi level .",
    "as a result , one can isolate two well - defined branches corresponding to two species of fermions : the right- and left - moving electrons . within each branch",
    ", the velocity of the electrons can be approximated by a constant and is given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively for right- and left - movers .",
    "upon changing from the moving to the stationary frame of reference , the electron velocities are modified in order to account for the drift velocity , and change from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the consequences for the electron fluid as described in the stationary frame of reference are two - fold .",
    "first , we need to introduce different fermi energies for right- and left - moving electrons , @xmath14 .",
    "second , since the density of states at the fermi level is inversely proportional to velocity , we now have different densities of states for the two subsystems , @xmath15 .",
    "the latter result implies that the energy spacing between states is not only modified as we change the frame of reference , but also differs between the right and left branches in the stationary frame .",
    "compared to the moving frame , the energy levels are stretched near the right fermi point .",
    "this results in a somewhat broader distribution function , which can be interpreted as a slightly higher effective temperature @xmath16 for the right - moving electrons ( see ) .",
    "similarly , near the left fermi point , the energy levels are squeezed compared to the moving frame , resulting in a narrower distribution function , corresponding to a lower effective temperature @xmath17 for the left - moving electrons .",
    "these effective temperatures follow the change in the density of states and are given by : @xmath18 the nature of these effective temperatures can be understood formally , by noticing that in the stationary frame , the system is no longer in thermal equilibrium because of the finite electric current .",
    "it follows that , quite generally , the occupation probability of a given state is no longer given by the standard fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "however , the introduction of the effective temperatures for right- and left - movers enables one to write their occupation probabilities as fermi functions of energy .",
    "because right- and left - movers have different temperatures , it is natural to expect that electron - electron interactions will give rise to thermalization between the two branches . in a uniform system",
    ", two - particle scattering processes can not lead to thermalization as the conservation of both energy and momentum only allows processes which either exchange the momenta of the two incoming electrons or leave them unchanged @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of inhomogeneous wires ,",
    "the strength of the interaction potential is non - uniform so that the system is no longer translationally invariant , and two - particle scattering processes which conserve energy but not momentum are allowed .",
    "a typical example of such electron - electron scattering processes is shown in .",
    "it describes the scattering of two electrons from an initial state with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 to a final state with momenta @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and violates the momentum conservation : @xmath23 .",
    "though the loss of momentum associated with this scattering process may affect the transport properties of the system , one could argue that it is compensated by an equal gain of momentum corresponding to the inverse process @xmath24 .",
    "this is however not the case here because of the temperature difference between the two branches : the processes involving a transfer of energy from the `` warmer '' right - moving branch to the `` colder '' left - moving one statistically occur more often than the corresponding inverse processes . as a result ,",
    "the electronic system loses more momentum than it gains .",
    "this overall loss of momentum can be viewed as resulting from a damping force , associated with the electron - electron collisions , and proportional to the temperature difference between the right- and left - moving branches . in order for a constant current to flow through the wire",
    ", this damping force has to be compensated by a driving force .",
    "the latter originates from a local electric field which appears as a response of the system to the external current . using the force balance , and keeping in mind that the temperature difference @xmath25 , this local electric field is proportional to the applied current bias .",
    "this implies a finite resistivity of the wire .",
    "the above arguments provide a physical picture of how inhomogeneities lead to a finite resistivity .",
    "we now proceed with the calculation of the resistivity .",
    "our starting point is a one - dimensional system of weakly interacting electrons with spins . in order to account for a non - uniform electron density @xmath26",
    ", we introduce a one - particle potential @xmath27 originating from the surrounding gates and impurities in the substrate . moreover , the interaction between electrons is inhomogeneous , and described by a smoothly varying potential @xmath28 , given in the center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 creates an electron with spin projection @xmath31 at position @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the chemical potential .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath27 is a smooth function of position , and that @xmath34 .",
    "this allows us to introduce a position - dependent fermi energy @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , the position - dependent fermi momentum and velocity are straightforwardly defined as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we keep a very general form for the interaction potential between electrons and only make the following assumptions concerning its characteristic length scales . on the one hand , we assume for simplicity that the interaction is short - range , the potential decaying rapidly as a function of the distance @xmath38 between electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "since we consider a non - uniform system , the interaction depends on the position @xmath39 of the center of mass .",
    "the variations with respect to @xmath39 are smooth and occur at a typical length scale @xmath40 , large compared to both the fermi wavelength and the range of the interaction potential .",
    "similarly , we assume that the potential @xmath27 varies at the same typical length scale @xmath40 as the interaction strength .",
    "we focus now on temperatures in a broad range @xmath41 . in order to compute the resistivity of the wire",
    ", we consider a force balance on a small isolated segment of wire taken at position @xmath32 , whose length @xmath42 well exceeds the range of the interaction while satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "when an external current @xmath4 is applied to the device , the response of the system manifests itself as a local electric field @xmath44 , which in turn leads to a driving force @xmath45 acting on the electrons .",
    "this driving force is compensated by a damping force @xmath46 resulting from the inhomogeneous electron - electron interaction , so that the resistivity can be written as @xmath47     corresponds to @xmath48 , while @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 , and @xmath51 to @xmath52 . following this correspondence , in the text we use the notations @xmath53 , 2@xmath54 and 1@xmath54 to refer respectively to @xmath55 , @xmath49 and @xmath51.,width=453 ]    the damping force",

    "the processes with a large momentum difference compared with the fermi momentum lead to exponentially small contributions . as a result , in what follows we focus on processes which only weakly violate the momentum conservation ( see ) .    because of the non - uniformity of the wire , strictly speaking the momentum of the electron is not a well - defined quantity . however , since @xmath27 varies smoothly over a length scale @xmath57 , it is possible to introduce a well - defined momentum over the size of the small segment under consideration .",

    "although the quadratic part of our bosonized hamiltonian is similar to the model considered @xcite , we do not reach the same final answer .",

    "if the size of the wire becomes too short with respect to the equilibration length @xmath205 , we expect our results to be modified by an additional small prefactor of the order of the ratio of these two length scales .",
