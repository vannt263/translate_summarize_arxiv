    "since its first synthesis in 2004 , @xcite graphene has been attracting much interest due to its unique electronic properties arising from its singular energy spectrum , where in the vicinity of the points labelled as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in reciprocal space , the charge carriers behave as massless quasi - particles and exhibit an almost linear dispersion .",
    "@xcite these quasi - particles obey the dirac - weyl equations and therefore should be subject to quasi - relativistic effects , such as zitterbewegung , i.e. , a trembling motion caused by interference between positive and negative energy states .",
    "@xcite the phenomenon of zitterbewegung was predicted in 1930 by schrdinger @xcite and has been subject of renewed interest over the past years .",
    "previous theoretical works have suggested few ways of experimentally observing zitterbewegung , e. g. in narrow - gap semiconductors @xcite , in iii - v zinc - blende semiconductor quantum wells with spin - orbit coupling @xcite and , more recently , in monolayer @xcite and bilayer @xcite graphene .",
    "an experimental simulation of the zitterbewegung of free relativistic electrons in vacuum was performed by gerritsma et al .",
    "@xcite by using trapped ions .",
    "strain engineering in graphene has recently become a widely studied topic .",
    "@xcite the elastic properties of graphene nanoribbons were theoretically investigated by cadelano _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , which studied the in - plane stretching and out of plane bending deformations by combining continuum elasticity theory and tight - binding atomistic simulations .",
    "later , cocco _ _ et al.__@xcite and lu and guo @xcite showed that a combination of shear and uniaxial strain at moderate absolute deformations can be used to open a gap in the graphene energy spectrum .",
    "it has been shown recently that specific forms of strain produce a pseudo - magnetic field in graphene , which does not break the time reversal symmetry and which points in opposite directions for electrons moving around the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points .",
    "@xcite the strain - induced magnetic field is expected to produce landau levels and , consequently , the quantum hall effect , even in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite guinea _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite showed theoretically that an in - plane bending of the graphene sheet leads to an almost uniform field .",
    "landau levels as a consequence of strain - induced pseudo - magnetic fields greater than 300 tesla were recently observed with scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) in nanometer size nanobubbles .",
    "@xcite    although previous works have studied wave packet propagation for the dirac - weyl hamiltonian of graphene in the absence of external fields and potentials , @xcite or in the presence of uniformly applied external magnetic fields @xcite , there is still a lack of theoretical works on the wave packet propagation through potential and ( pseudo ) magnetic field step barriers .",
    "moreover , the time evolution of a wave packet in graphene within the tight - binding ( tb ) model , where the intra - valley scattering to higher energy states and inter - valley scattering due to defects appear naturally , is still hardly found in the literature .",
    "it is also interesting to see whether the results from dirac and tb approaches for graphene differ or are similar .    in this paper , we investigate the time - evolution of wavepackets in graphene within the tb model , based on the split - operator technique for the expansion of the time - evolution operator .",
    "we trace a parallel between the results from the tb model and those obtained from the dirac approximation for particles with momentum close to one of the dirac cones of the brillouin zone of graphene .",
    "the proposed method is then applied to the study of the dynamics of gaussian wave packets in graphene under external magnetic fields .",
    "the effects of the pseudo - magnetic field induced by bending the graphene sheet into an arc of circle are analyzed as well .",
    "our results show that for an appropriate choice of strain and external magnetic field strength , the system exhibits a strong effective magnetic field for particles in one of the dirac cones , whereas in the other cone the external and pseudo - magnetic fields cancel each other and the effective magnetic field is practically zero .",
    "we show that this effect is manifested as a transient ( permanent ) zitterbewegung for electrons in the cone where the effective magnetic field is zero ( non - zero ) , which can be verified experimentally by detecting the electric field radiation emitted by the trembling wave packet .",
    "@xcite moreover , our results show that with such a choice of external and strain - induced magnetic fields , one can construct an efficient valley - filter , which can be useful for future valley - tronic devices .",
    "by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation , one obtains that the propagated wavefunction after a time step @xmath2 can be calculated by applying the time - evolution operator on the wave packet at any instant @xmath3 @xmath4 where we assumed that the hamiltonian @xmath5 is time - independent .",

    "<S> the time evolution of a wavepacket in strained graphene is studied within the tight - binding model and continuum model . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of an external magnetic field , as well as a strain - induced pseudo - magnetic field , on the wave packet trajectories and zitterbewegung are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> combining the effects of strain with those of an external magnetic field produces an effective magnetic field which is large in one of the dirac cones , but can be practically zero in the other . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an efficient valley filter , where for a propagating incoming wave packet consisting of momenta around the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dirac points , the outgoing wave packet exhibits momenta in only one of these dirac points , while the components of the packet that belong to the other dirac point are reflected due to the lorentz force . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the zitterbewegung is permanent in time in the presence of either external or strain - induced magnetic fields , but when both the external and strain - induced magnetic fields are present , the zitterbewegung is transient in one of the dirac cones , whereas in the other cone the wave packet exhibits permanent spatial oscillations . </S>"
