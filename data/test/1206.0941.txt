    "because the ufd metallicity distribution extends much lower than that of any globular cluster , the age determination must rely upon theoretical isochrones ( see  3.2 ) , but a comparison to m92 is still instructive .    in our analysis ,",
    "the largest uncertainties are the distances of the ufds relative to the globular cluster calibrators of our isochrone library , with emphasis on m92 .",
    "we determined apparent distance moduli by minimizing the luminosity differences between the ufd horizontal branch ( hb ) stars ( figure 1 ; red points ) and the horizontal region of the m92 hb locus ( blue points ) .",

    "note that if we were to assume the shorter distances and/or lower reddening in the literature , the ufd ages relative to m92 would _",
    "increase_. the observed ufd cmds would not change , but the m92 ridge line would shift brighter and bluer , making the ms turnoff in each galaxy appear fainter and redder ( and thus older ) relative to that in m92 , which would significantly violate the age of the universe ( @xmath33 ; jarosik et al .  2011 ) unless other factors ( e.g. , cno abundances ) were adjusted accordingly .    with these caveats ,",
    "we show the comparison of each ufd to m92 in figure  1 .",
    "hb morphology is most sensitive to metallicity ( but also age and the abundances of he and cno ) , with the hb color distribution shifting toward the blue at lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "the colors of the hb stars in each ufd are consistent with their metallicities , in the sense that @xmath9[fe / h]@xmath10 is slightly higher in ursa major  i than in hercules or leo  iv ( table  1 ) , and its hb stars are somewhat redder , but this may be due to small number statistics .",
    "the rgb appears slightly wider than one would expect from the photometric errors and metallicity distribution , but this is uncertain , given the field contamination .",
    "the ms turnoff and sgb in each ufd extends slightly brighter and bluer than those features on the m92 ridge line . if we did not know the metallicity distributions",
    ", we would conclude that the brighter and bluer stars have ages a few gyr younger or metallicities up to @xmath01  dex lower than m92 .",
    "however , we know the ufd metallicities extend below [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath34 , so these stars are consistent in age with m92 , as we show below .      because the ufds are among the most metal - poor populations in the local universe , we can not rely solely upon empirical stellar population templates ( e.g. , globular clusters ) to analyze them .",
    "we must extend these empirical templates to lower metallicities using theoretical models .",
    "for this purpose , we employ the victoria - regina isochrones ( vandenberg et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "compared to the previous version of the code ( vandenberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , the current version includes , among other things , the effects of he diffusion , the latest improvements to the h - burning nuclear reaction rates , and an update to the asplund et al .  (",
    "2009 ) solar metals mixture .",
    "the net effect of these changes is to reduce the age at a given turnoff luminosity by @xmath00.5  gyr .",
    "our purpose here is to use these isochrones to derives ages _ relative _ to those of the globular clusters , but these effects should be kept in mind when considering absolute ages .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 2005 ) produced a set of empirical population templates in the acs f606w and f814w filters , spanning a wide metallicity range , based upon galactic globular and old open clusters .",
    "they then calibrated a transformation of the victoria - regina isochrones into the same filters , producing agreement at the 1% level . here , we have adjusted this transformation by 0.03  mag in color .",
    "this adjustment accounts for the new version of the victoria - regina isochrones and the current state of the literature regarding cluster parameters .",
    "these isochrones match the acs cmds of 47  tuc at an age of 12.3 gyr , ngc  6752 at an age of 13.2  gyr , and m92 at an age of 13.7  gyr .",
    "as discussed in  3.1 , m92 is the most relevant calibrator , but the other clusters demonstrate that the isochrones are valid over a wide range of [ fe / h ] ( @xmath35 to @xmath25 ) .",
    "we stress that these absolute ages depend critically upon the assumed distance moduli and oxygen abundances .    in figure  1 , we show the expected location of stars in the acs cmds for ages within a gyr of the m92 age ( i.e. , 12.714.7 gyr ) at two different metallicities : that of m92 ( i.e. , [ fe / h]@xmath36 ; blue curve ) and the low extreme of the metallicity distribution in these ufds ( [ fe / h]@xmath37 ; green curve )",
    ". it is clear from the comparison that the luminosity of the ms turnoff and sgb in each galaxy is consistent with ancient metal - poor stars .",
    "the few stars immediately brighter and bluer than the old ms turnoff are blue stragglers , which are ubiquitous in old populations . if these were young stars , each ufd would have a star - formation history consisting of two delta functions in age , with a few percent of the stars at @xmath04  gyr and the rest ancient ; continuous low - level star formation would produce intermediate - age ms and sgb stars that are not observed .",
    "although the ms turnoff becomes bluer and brighter at both younger ages and lower metallicities , this age - metallicity degeneracy can be broken by simultaneously fitting the ms , sgb , and rgb in a cmd .",
    "however , the scarcity of rgb stars and multitude of field stars precludes this type of fit here .",
    "instead , we rely upon the observed metallicity distribution from spectral synthesis of neutral fe lines ( kirby et al .  2008 ; based upon keck spectroscopy from simon & geha 2007 ) .",
    "for the current analysis , we will use the relatively well - populated cmd of hercules as an example , employing the 15 rgb stars with low spectroscopic errors ( @xmath90.3  dex ) observed to date .",
    "we constructed a library of cmd probability clouds representing simple stellar populations spanning @xmath38[fe / h]@xmath39 and ages of 1016  gyr .",
    "the probability clouds were populated using the victoria - regina isochrones , a salpeter imf , and the photometric scattering and completeness from the artificial star tests .",
    "synthetic cmds constructed from this library were fit to the observed cmd by allowing the ages of the components to float while holding the metallicity distribution fixed , using a downhill simplex to minimize the maximum likelihood statistic of dolphin ( 2002 ) .",
    "the fits were repeated with a fine grid of starting conditions to avoid a spurious result driven by local minima in the fit .",
    "uncertainties in the derived age were determined by fitting repeated monte carlo realizations of the observed cmd .",
    "the cmd was fit in the vicinity of the ms turnoff ( @xmath40  mag ) , given its sensitivity to age , while excluding the lower ms stars that provide no age leverage .",
    "note that the mass range spanned by our fit is only @xmath00.03 @xmath41 , and thus insensitive to the assumed imf .",
    "we find a mean age of 13.6  gyr for hercules .",
    "formally , the statistical uncertainty is 0.2 gyr , consistent with the age of m92 ( 13.7  gyr ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties from distance and [ o / fe ] are each potentially as large as 0.6  gyr .    to demonstrate the sensitivity of these cmds to age , we show in figure  2 three simulated cmds for hercules .",
    "each cmd assumes the observed spectroscopic metallicity distribution , under three age assumptions : 1 gyr younger than m92 ( left panel ) , the same age as m92 ( middle panel ) , and 1 gyr older than m92 ( right panel ) .",
    "it is clear that the best match to the observed hercules cmd ( figure  1 ) is the middle panel , where the populations have the same age as m92 .",
    "although the population statistics are best in hercules , the similarity of the leo  iv and ursa major  i cmds implies that they also host populations of approximately the same age .",
    "none of these galaxies appears to host a significant population of stars younger than m92 .    in the hercules",
    "spectroscopy , approximately 20% of the rgb stars fall at [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath42 . in the hercules cmd ( figure  1 ) ,",
    "the stars immediately below the m92 sgb , especially near the ms , are consistent with such stars at ages within a gyr of m92 ( cf .  figure 2 ) , although the exact number is uncertain , given the field contamination . however",
    ", if any of these stars at [ fe / h]@xmath43 were as much as 2 gyr younger than m92 , they would be difficult to discern in the hercules cmd , because the sgb for such stars would fall within the dominant sgb observed for hercules ( i.e. , within the region bounded by the blue and green fiducials of figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , while it is clear that most stars in hercules are as old as those in m92 , we can not at this time rule out a minority sub - population of stars ( up to @xmath010% of the total population ) that are 12  gyr younger at the high end of the hercules metallicity distribution .",
    "the three ufd galaxies here are among the more distant of those known in the milky way system , at 100150  kpc , so ground - based cmds of each implied they were old ( @xmath1010  gyr ) , but could not put tight constraints on their ages ( e.g. , sand et al .",
    "2009 ; sand et al .  2010 ; okamoto et al .  2008 , 2012 ;",
    "adn et al .",
    "our _ hst _ observations reach well below the ms turnoff in each galaxy , revealing that all three host truly ancient metal - poor populations .",
    "the majority of the stars in each galaxy must have ages within 1  gyr of m92 s age , with younger ages strongly ruled out , although we can not exclude a trace population of stars 12  gyr younger than m92 at the high end of the metallicity distribution .",
    "two ufd galaxies ( bootes  i and coma berenices ) are significantly closer ( 4466 kpc ) , such that ground - based cmds can place constraints on their ages approaching those possible with _ hst _ ( muoz et al .  2010 ; okamoto et al .",
    "these cmds also imply ages approximately as old as m92 , although the use of distinct bandpasses hampers accurate comparisons to our observations .",
    "our _ hst _ survey includes these galaxies , enabling accurate age measurements in a significant sample of ufds , with all observed in the same photometric system as each other and the most ancient globular clusters .",
    "if we include bootes  i and coma berenices , it seems likely that at least 5 ufd galaxies have ages consistent with that of the oldest known globular cluster ( m92 ) , with no evidence for significantly younger populations .",
    "this is in striking contrast to any other galaxy class in the local universe .",
    "our external vantage point for andromeda enables accurate ages throughout its halo , using the same instrument and techniques described here , yet all such measurements to date have found an extended star formation history , with significant numbers of stars younger than 10  gyr ( brown et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) . an _ hst _ survey of 60 dwarf galaxies within 4  mpc found that most formed the bulk of their stars prior to @xmath44 , but none were consistent with a purely ancient population ( weisz et al .",
    "the ufds may be the only galaxies where star formation ended in the earliest epoch of the universe .",
    "if so , the apparent synchronicity to their star formation histories suggests a truncation induced by a global event , such as reionization ( 13.3  gyr ago ; jarosik et al .",
