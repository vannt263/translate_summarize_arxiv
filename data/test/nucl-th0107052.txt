    "the analysis of ( @xmath4 ) reactions at photon energies above the giant resonance was the object of a long debate concerning the mechanism of the reaction ( see e.g. ref .",

    ", the fact that the experimental cross sections for proton emission can be easily fitted with a single particle wave function addresses to a direct knockout ( dko ) mechanism  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the transitions with neutron emission , being of the same order of magnitude as those with proton emission , were considered as a clear indication of a quasi - deuteron reaction mechanism  @xcite .",
    "a number of corrections were applied to the dko model  @xcite in order to explain both ( @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6 ) cross sections , but were unable to give a reasonable explanation of the data .    in recent years , the development of tagged photon facilities allowed to perform experiments with high energy resolution and a clear separation of the different individual states of the residual nucleus .",
    "a large number of experimental data was produced at the electron microtron accelerator mami - a in mainz and at the max - laboratory in lund ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the ( @xmath5 ) reaction the dko mechanism represents a large part of the measured cross sections for the low - lying states and in the photon energy range above the giant resonance and below the pion production threshold .",
    "the results , however , are very sensitive to the theoretical ingredients adopted for bound and scattering states  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "various calculations in different theoretical approaches indicate that a prominent role is played by more complicated processes , like meson exchange currents ( mec ) and multi - step processes due to nuclear correlations  @xcite .",
    "nonrelativistic calculations based on the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) and with consistent theoretical ingredients for bound and scattering states ( i.e. overlap functions , spectroscopic factors and optical model parameters able to give a good description of ( @xmath7 ) data ) are unable to describe ( @xmath5 ) data  @xcite .",
    "a reasonable agreement and a consistent description is obtained when the contribution of mec is added to dko in the ( @xmath5 ) reaction  @xcite .",
    "mec produce a significant enhancement of the ( @xmath5 ) cross sections calculated with dko and affect both the shape and the magnitude of the angular distributions .",
    "for the ( @xmath6 ) reaction , where the dko mechanism gives only a small fraction of the measured cross section , mec and more complicated processes give the dominant contribution  @xcite .",
    "however , the relative importance of the different mechanisms on ( @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6 ) reactions is still not completely understood and justifies the interest on other effects , like relativistic corrections , nuclear current ambiguities and off - shell behavior of the bound nucleons .",

    "the dko mechanism was able to reproduce the @xmath2o@xmath1 cross section for an incident photon energy of 60 mev  @xcite .",
    "the same approach was then extended to several target nuclei and to a much wider energy range falling into the @xmath8-excitation region  @xcite .",
    "the comparison between these calculations and data suggests that dko is the leading contribution for missing momentum values up to about 500 mev/@xmath9 , while for larger values of the missing momentum an important effect is expected from mec and @xmath8-excitation .",
    "other studies within the same theoretical approach discussed the differences between relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations for @xmath1 and ( @xmath10 reactions  @xcite .",
    "they found noticeable medium modifications in the interaction hamiltonian due to relativistic potentials , which suggest that the role of mec could be strongly modified with respect to a nonrelativistic approach . in any case",
    "these relativistic models did not consider the ( @xmath6 ) reaction .",
    "different models based on a fully relativistic dwia ( rdwia ) framework have been developed in recent years and successfully applied to the analysis of ( @xmath7 ) data  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite we have compared relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations for the ( @xmath7 ) knockout reaction in order to study relativistic effects for cross sections and structure functions and to establish a limit in energy of the validity of a nonrelativistic approach . in this paper",
    "we make a similar comparison for ( @xmath4 ) reactions .",
    "relativistic effects are different in different situations and kinematics . in ( @xmath4 ) at intermediate photon energies the mismatch between the momentum transfer and the momentum of the outgoing nucleon is quite large and larger values of the missing momentum are explored than in usual ( @xmath7 ) experiments .",
    "thus , different effects can be expected for the two reactions .",
    "our aim is to clarify the relationship between the rdwia and dwia approaches for ( @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6 ) reactions also in comparison with data , and to check the relevance of the dko mechanism in relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations .",

    "relativistic calculations of the @xmath3 cross sections give huge off - shell ambiguities . the @xmath65 and @xmath79 prescriptions coincide in the neutron case , but the enhancement obtained with @xmath76 is dramatic and brings the rdwia results above the data at @xmath15 = 60 mev and in good agreement with data at @xmath15 = 150 and 200 mev . however , we can not argue that the dko mechanism with the @xmath76 prescription correctly describes @xmath3 cross sections .",

    "there are sensible differences between the results of the two approaches , but in both cases the experimental cross sections are largely underestimated .",
