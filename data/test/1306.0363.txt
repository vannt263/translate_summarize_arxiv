    "the control and detection of single spins is of considerable recent interest",
    ". a particularly interesting method of detecting a single spin on a surface is possible by a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "the technique has been initiated and developed by y. manassen and various collaborators @xcite .",
    "it is based on monitoring the noise , i.e. the stm current - current correlations , and observing a signal at the expected larmor frequency , a signal that is sharp even at room temperature .",
    "the larmor frequency is also seen in an electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiment with many spins , in contrast , the esr - stm method observes a single spin and furthermore , the system is static , no oscillating field is applied as in esr .",
    "the observed frequency is found to vary linearly with the applied magnetic field , confirming that the stm has detected an isolated spin on the surface .",
    "this phenomenon was first demonstrated on oxidized si(111 ) surface @xcite and then on fe atoms @xcite on si(111 ) as well as on a variety of organic molecules on a graphite surface @xcite and on au(111 ) surfaces @xcite .",
    "recent extensions have resolved two resonance peaks on oxidized si(111 ) @xmath0 surface corresponding to site specific @xmath1 factors @xcite as well as to observation of hyperfine coupling @xcite .",
    "we further note that the spatial dependence of the signal shows a non - monotonic contour plot , i.e. the signal is elongated and is maximal at @xmath2 nm on either side of a minimum point @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the esr - stm effect is not settled @xcite .",
    "the emergence of a finite frequency in a steady state stationary situation is a non - trivial phenomenon .",
    "an obvious mechanism for coupling the charge current to the spin precession is spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "it was shown that an esr signal is present in the noise with spin - orbit coupling when the leads are polarized , either for a strong coulomb interaction @xcite or for the non - interacting case @xcite , and even in linear response @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental data @xcite involves a small field of @xmath3 g corresponding to a larmor frequency of @xmath4mhz , i.e. @xmath5 relative to a lead s bandwidth .",
    "it was found in these spin - orbit models @xcite that the signal vanishes when the lead polarization vanishes , or when the lead and dot polarization are parallel , as for a uniform magnetic field .",
    "it was argued that an effective spin polarization is realized as a fluctuation effect either for a small number of electrons that pass the localized spin in one cycle @xcite or due to 1/f magnetic noise of the tunneling current @xcite .",
    "it was further shown that spin - orbit coupling in an asymmetric dot can yield an oscillating electric dipole , possibly affecting the stm current @xcite .    in the present work we follow a recently proposed model that allows for an esr - stm phenomena with non - polarized leads @xcite .",
    "the model assumes an additional direct tunneling between the tip and the substrate in parallel to tunneling via the dot s states , i.e. a nanoscopic interferometer .",
    "the numerical study @xcite shows that the interference of the direct current and that via the spin has an esr signal in the noise , a signal that increases with the direct tunneling .",
    "this model is motivated by studies of quantum dots with spin - orbit @xcite and by stm studies of a two - impurity kondo system that shows a significant direct coupling between the tip and substrate states @xcite .",
    "similar models including a aharonov - bohm phase have been studied @xcite .",
    "the nanoscopic interferometer model is consistent with the unusual non - monotonic contour plot @xcite , i.e. the signal is maximized when the stm tip is not directly on the spin center but slightly away , so as to maximize an overlap with a surface state of the substrate . in the present work we consider non - polarized leads , as relevant to the experimental setup , and",
    "evaluate the noise analytically in the stationary system , in accord with the numerical results for this case .",
    "the analytic results clarify the physical processes of the resonance phenomenon and allow us to discuss the esr - stm effect for a broad range of parameters , as in the conclusion section below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian of the system and present the results for direct tunneling : effective action , the current and the current noise power spectrum . sec .",
    "iii contains the effective action of the dot and the expression for the current flow through dot .",
    "iv reflects our principal result : the resonance part of the current spectral density .",
    "the results are illustrated by figs 1,2 .",
    "finally our conclusions are contained in sec.v .",
    "the appendices a , b , c give various details of the calculations .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system describes direct tunneling through the dot between left ( l ) and right ( r ) leads as well as l - r tunneling via the dot states , @xmath6 where the lead hamiltonians are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the spin and @xmath10 are the continuum states .",
    "the dot hamiltonian is @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the mean position of the dot levels and @xmath14 is the applied magnetic field that includes the @xmath1 factor and the bohr magneton .",
    "we assume that the dispersions @xmath15 of the lead electrons are spin independent , justified by the small ratio @xmath5 of the larmor frequency and a typical electron bandwidth .",
    "a general spin - orbit coupling involves unitary matrices that can be parameterized @xcite by two angles @xmath16 .",

    "the source term has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a pauli matrix in the rotated keldysh space .",
    "the total action is @xmath28 where @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath30 , i.e. tunneling via the dot @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the action of the dot @xmath33 @xmath34 is the green s function ( gf ) of the noninteracting dot in the rotated keldysh representation that has the form @xmath35 with retarded ( @xmath21 ) , advanced ( @xmath36 ) and keldysh ( @xmath37 ) indices as superscripts .",
    "the current via the dot @xmath38 is chosen as a symmetric combination of the current from the left lead to the dot @xmath39 and that from the dot to the right lead @xmath40 .",
    "in general a linear combination of these currents is needed , depending on various capacitances @xcite .",
    "we expect that the resonance effect is dominated by single occupancy of the dot and the latter two currents are equal .",
    "indeed we check below that our results for the resonance term do not depend on which linear combination is used .",

    "the levels therefore remain between the two chemical potentials and we expect that the resonance part of the noise is weakly affected by @xmath162 .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached for the case with polarized leads @xcite .",
    "we note also that the insensitivity of the resonance term to the choice of @xmath39 or @xmath40 to represent the current via the dot implies that the charge occupancy of the dot is constant , i.e. singly occupied .",

    "some of our other results can be obtained for small @xmath167 by simple estimates : the resonance linewidth follows from a golden rule @xmath168 ; the dc current via the dot @xmath169 for @xmath170 ( eq .
