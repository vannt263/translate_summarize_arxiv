    "a football pattern is a graph embedded in the two - sphere in such a way that all faces are pentagons and hexagons , satisfying the conditions that the edges of each pentagon meet only edges of hexagons , and that the edges of each hexagon alternately meet edges of pentagons and of hexagons .",
    "if one requires that there are exactly three faces meeting at each vertex , then euler s formula implies that the pattern consists of @xmath0 pentagons and @xmath1 hexagons .",
    "moreover , in this case the combinatorics of the pattern is uniquely determined .",
    "this pattern , which we shall refer to as the standard football , has a particularly symmetric realisation with all polygons regular , which can be thought of as a truncated icosahedron .",
    "if one drops the requirement that there are exactly three polygons meeting at each vertex , then one can exhibit infinitely many distinct football patterns by lifting to branched covers of the standard football branched only in vertices of the pattern .",
    "in the first part of this paper we shall prove that these are the only football patterns on the two - sphere .",
    "for the proof we consider the dual graph of a football pattern as a coloured ribbon graph .",
    "the dual of the standard football with @xmath0 pentagons and @xmath1 hexagons is shown in the picture on the first page of this paper . to make the picture symmetric , a black vertex is spread out at infinity and is depicted by the shaded ring around the rest of the graph .",
    "of course we could consider the dual graph as a map , but in order to make clear the distinction between football patterns and their duals , we will always use the language of maps , cf .",
    "@xcite , for the football patterns themselves , and the language of ribbon graphs , cf .",
    "@xcite , for their duals .",
    "all the football graphs , that is ribbon graphs dual to football patterns , have the same universal covering , which is a certain tree @xmath5 .",
    "we shall determine the automorphism group of @xmath5 and prove that every cofinite subgroup of the automorphism group whose quotient gives rise to the dual of a spherical pattern is a subgroup of the group giving rise to the standard football .",
    "we also consider football patterns on surfaces of higher genera and show that the classification theorem does not hold for them ; in other words , not all of them can be obtained by taking branched covers of the standard football . however , football patterns on surfaces of higher genera always admit branched covers of degree at most @xmath6 which in turn are also branched covers of the standard spherical football",
    ".    one may wonder what special rle pentagons and hexagons play in this discussion .",
    "we shall address this question in the second part of this paper , where we determine all the possibilities for triples @xmath7 that can be realised by maps on the two - sphere whose faces are @xmath3-gons and @xmath4-gons satisfying the conditions that the edges of each @xmath3-gon meet only edges of @xmath4-gons , and that every @xmath8 edge of each @xmath4-gon meets an edge of a @xmath3-gon , and its other edges meet @xmath4-gons .",
    "not surprisingly , the determination of these triples is a generalisation of the topological argument determining the platonic solids . in most cases the generalised football patterns have realisations dual to very symmetric triangulations of the sphere that have been known and studied since the @xmath9 century .",
    "that purely topological or combinatorial considerations lead to a list that contains almost only the usual symmetric patterns and their degenerations is a kind of rigidity phenomenon associated with these spherical triangulations .",
    "we shall see that the classification theorem for spherical football patterns proved in the first part of this paper for the triple @xmath10 actually holds for all generalised football patterns with @xmath11 : each generalized football with a pattern of type @xmath12 is a branched cover of the corresponding minimal pattern .",
    "we shall also see that this result does not extend to @xmath13 .",
    "we are grateful to b.  hanke and b.  leeb for helpful comments , and to the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ for support .",
    "a football pattern is a map in the sense of  @xcite on the two - sphere satisfying the usual conditions that at least three edges meet at every vertex , that all faces are pentagons and hexagons , that the edges of each pentagon meet only edges of hexagons , and that the edges of each hexagon alternately meet edges of pentagons and of hexagons .",
    "we make no regularity assumption , so that a football pattern is not a geometric , but a combinatorial - topological object",
    ".    a football pattern determines , and is determined by , its dual graph .",
    "this graph has a vertex for every polygon in the pattern , and the vertices are coloured , say black for the vertices corresponding to pentagons and white for the vertices corresponding to hexagons .",
    "two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding polygons share an edge .",
    "the edges meeting at a vertex are cyclically ordered ( with respect to this endpoint ) by remembering that the sides of a polygon are cyclically ordered .",
    "therefore the dual graph is a fatgraph or ribbon graph in the sense of  @xcite , leading to the following definition :    [ d : basic ] a football graph is a ribbon graph with black and white vertices satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "each black vertex has valence five , and all five edges connect the given vertex to white vertices , and 2 .",
    "each white vertex has valence six , and the six edges alternately connect the given vertex to black and white vertices .",
    "the picture at the beginning of this paper shows the dual ribbon graph of the standard football pattern on @xmath14 consisting of @xmath0 pentagons and @xmath1 hexagons . to make the picture symmetric ,",
    "a black vertex is spread out at infinity and is depicted by the shaded ring around the rest of the graph . as every finite ribbon graph corresponds to a unique closed oriented surface , we have a natural bijection between football graphs and football patterns on arbitrary closed oriented surfaces .",
    "a covering map between football graphs corresponds to a possibly branched covering map between surfaces , with any branching restricted to the centers of the faces of the decompositions given by the football graphs .",
    "as the football graphs are dual to actual football patterns , branching can only occur at the vertices of patterns .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the numbers of black and white vertices in a football graph @xmath17 .",
    "then the total number of vertices is @xmath18 , and the number of edges is @xmath19 . of these edges ,",
    "@xmath20 have white endpoints , and @xmath21 have a black and a white endpoint .",
    "it follows that there is a natural number @xmath22 such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "[ l : triangle ] the only football graph giving a triangulation of a closed surface is the dual graph @xmath25 of the standard spherical football with @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the closed oriented surface defined by a football graph @xmath17 .",
    "by euler s formula , the number of faces in the cell decomposition of @xmath27 determined by @xmath17 is @xmath28 if @xmath17 defines a triangulation of @xmath27 , then we must have @xmath29 , which , rewritten in terms of @xmath22 , means @xmath30 , or @xmath31 .",
    "thus @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is @xmath14 .",
    "the combinatorics of the corresponding football pattern is uniquely determined in this case , as can be seen from the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] below .",
    "there is precisely one connected and simply connected football graph , which we shall call the football tree @xmath5 .",
    "it is the universal cover of any football graph .",
    "as @xmath5 thought of as a ribbon graph is an orientable surface , it makes sense to speak of orientation - preserving automorphisms , and we shall denote the group of all such automorphisms by @xmath32 . this can be determined explicitly :    the automorphism group @xmath32 of the football tree is isomorphic to the free product @xmath33 .",
    "this is a straightforward application of the bass  serre theory of groups acting on trees , cf .",
    "this theory is usually formulated for groups acting on trees without inverting edges . in our situation , there are automorphisms inverting edges that connect a pair of white vertices .",
    "therefore , we subdivide each of these edges by introducing red vertices in the middle of each edge connecting two white edges of @xmath5 .",
    "we obtain a new tree @xmath34 , which has three kinds of edges : the white and black ones of valence @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , and red ones of valence @xmath37 .",
    "the red and black vertices are only connected to white ones , and the edges meeting at a white vertex lead alternately to red and black vertices .",
    "now @xmath32 acts on @xmath34 without inverting any edges . the action is simply transitive on the two kinds of edges , black - white and red - white .",
    "the action is also transitive on the vertices of a given colour , with isotropy groups of orders @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 for the red , white and black vertices .",
    "the quotient graph @xmath39 is a tree with three vertices , one for each colour , and with one edge connecting the white vertex to each of the other vertices .",
    "we think of this as a graph of groups by labeling the vertices with the isotropy groups . as the edges have trivial isotropy , the fundamental group of this graph of groups is the free product of the labels of the vertices . by the structure theorem of  section  i.5.4 in  @xcite ,",
    "this fundamental group is isomorphic to @xmath32 .",
    "we now want to prove that every football pattern on the sphere is obtained as a branched cover of the standard football branched only in the vertices .",
    "equivalently , we prove that the spherical dual ribbon graphs are all obtained as covering spaces of the dual graph of the standard football .",
    "the first step is the following :    [ l : prep ] let @xmath17 be a football graph with universal covering @xmath40 .",
    "suppose that @xmath41 is an oriented path in @xmath5 consisting of a sequence of edges without backtracking .",
    "if @xmath42 maps @xmath41 to a closed path that corresponds to a boundary component of @xmath17 thought of as a surface with boundary , then @xmath41 consists of @xmath43 edges for some natural number @xmath44 , and the image of @xmath41 in the standard football graph @xmath25 is a loop that is the @xmath8 power of the loop formed by a triangle in the triangulation defined by @xmath25 , cf .",
    "lemma  [ l : triangle ] .",
    "we think of @xmath5 as a surface with boundary .",
    "choose a boundary component @xmath45 covering the boundary component @xmath46 of @xmath17 to which @xmath41 is mapped .",
    "as a boundary component of @xmath5 , @xmath45 runs right along a sequence @xmath47 of oriented edges in @xmath5 such that , of course , the origin @xmath48 of each edge coincides with the endpoint of the previous edge , and , in addition , with respect to the cyclic order of edges emanating from @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the successor of @xmath51 .",
    "( the bar denotes edge inversion . )",
    "it follows from definition  [ d : basic ] that the sequence of vertices @xmath48 is of the form _ black , white , white , black , white , white _ , etc .",
    "the setwise stabilizer of @xmath45 in @xmath32 is the infinite cyclic group generated by the translation @xmath52 , which maps @xmath50 to @xmath53 .",
    "now @xmath54 , for some subgroup @xmath55 , i.e.  @xmath56 for some @xmath57 .",
    "thus @xmath46 runs along a @xmath43-gon , which must be @xmath58 .    by assumption ,",
    "the path @xmath41 is a piece @xmath59 of the sequence @xmath60 and projects to @xmath58 .",
    "therefore @xmath61 .",
    "the images of @xmath50 in the standard football still satisfy the condition that consecutive edges be related by the cyclic ordering defining the ribbon graph structure .",
    "but this means that the image of @xmath62 is a triangle .",
    "here is the classification theorem for spherical football patterns :    [ t : main ] every football graph dual to a football pattern on @xmath14 is a finite covering space of the standard football graph @xmath25 .",
    "equivalently every football pattern on @xmath14 is obtained from the standard one by passing to a branched cover branched only in vertices of the pattern .    given a spherical football graph @xmath17 ,",
    "fix a universal covering @xmath63 of @xmath17 and a universal covering @xmath64 of the standard football graph @xmath25 .",
    "we are going to show that the group of deck transformations @xmath65 is a subgroup of @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 factors through @xmath42 .",
    "choose a point @xmath68 on an edge of @xmath5 that is not an endpoint or a midpoint , so that it has trivial stabilizer in @xmath32 .",
    "covering space theory identifies the group of deck transformations @xmath69 with the fundamental group @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath17 is spherical , this fundamental group is generated by paths of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath41 is a loop along a boundary component , @xmath72 runs from the base point @xmath73 to the origin of @xmath41 and @xmath74 is the way back . lifting @xmath72 and @xmath41 to @xmath5 we",
    "obtain a path @xmath75 leading from @xmath68 to @xmath76 , with @xmath52 from the proof of the previous lemma .",
    "hence @xmath77 is the deck transformation corresponding to the given generator of @xmath70 .",
    "this proves the result , because @xmath52 is a deck transformation over @xmath25 .",
    "this proof also shows :    the subgroup @xmath78 is normal .",
    "the quotient @xmath79 is the icosahedral group of order @xmath6 .",
    "every ribbon graph corresponds to a unique closed oriented surface , and of course every such surface does indeed arise from a football graph , for example because it is a branched covering of the two - sphere , which we can arrange to be branched only in the vertices of a suitable football pattern .",
    "we now want to show that there are other football patterns on surfaces of positive genera , that are not lifted from the two - sphere .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] does not extend , because for a ribbon graph corresponding to a surface of positive genus there are generators in the fundamental group that arise from handles , rather than from the punctures .",
    "recall that the parameter @xmath22 for a finite football graph specifies the number of black and white vertices by the formulae @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "passing to a @xmath80-fold covering multiplies @xmath22 by @xmath80 .",
    "as the standard football graph @xmath25 has @xmath26 , all its non - trivial coverings have @xmath81 . therefore , to exhibit football graphs that are not coverings of @xmath25 , it suffices to find examples of positive genus with @xmath82 . performing certain cut - and - paste operations on @xmath25",
    ", we can actually produce examples with @xmath26 and rather large genera .",
    "the simplest example is the following .",
    "[ ex : sum ] pick two disjoint edges in the standard football pattern , that are of the same type , so that they both separate hexagons from each other , or they both separate a pentagon from a hexagon .",
    "open up the two - sphere along these edges to obtain a cylinder whose two boundary circles each have two vertices and two edges .",
    "as the two edges along which we opened the sphere were of the same type , the two boundary circles of the cylinder can be identified in such a way that the resulting torus carries an induced football pattern with @xmath26 .    in this example",
    "there are @xmath83 vertices instead of the @xmath6 in the standard spherical football .",
    "all but two of them are @xmath38-valent , and the exceptional two are @xmath35-valent .    in the language of ribbon graphs ,",
    "the surgery performed in the above example amounts to cutting two ribbons and regluing the resulting ends in a different pairing .",
    "this can also be done with ribbons corresponding to edges that share a vertex , in which case instead of cutting and pasting , the surgery can be described through the reordering of edges :    [ ex : surgery ] let @xmath84 be the edges emanating from a black vertex in the standard football graph @xmath25 .",
    "define a new football graph @xmath17 by reordering the edges as @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "this procedure glues the three triangles whose edges include @xmath87 or @xmath86 into a single @xmath90-gon boundary component of @xmath17 .",
    "this new graph still has @xmath26 , but the underlying surface is a torus . in the dual football pattern",
    "there are @xmath83 vertices , of which @xmath91 are @xmath38-valent and one is @xmath90-valent .",
    "[ ex : symmetric - genus-24 ] let @xmath92 be the edges emanating from a white vertex in the standard football graph @xmath25 , enumerated in their cyclic order and labelled such that @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath89 have black ends . define a new ribbon graph by reordering the edges cyclically as @xmath93 .",
    "this means that the edges leading to white vertices are cut and reattached after a cyclic permutation given geometrically by a rotation by angle @xmath94 around the vertex in the realisation of @xmath25 with icosahedral symmetry .",
    "we apply this procedure to every white vertex of @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting football graph @xmath17 is symmetric in the sense that it admits rotations of order @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 around an edge , a white vertex and a black vertex , respectively .",
    "hence the full football group @xmath32 acts on @xmath17 .",
    "in particular all faces are conjugate .",
    "one can verify by inspection that the faces are @xmath95-gons .",
    "hence the euler characteristic of the underlying surface is @xmath96 , and its genus is @xmath97 .",
    "this is a football graph with @xmath26 and is therefore not a covering of @xmath25 .",
    "although football graphs of positive genera are not in general coverings of @xmath25 , we have the following :    every football pattern on a closed oriented surface admits a branched cover of degree @xmath98 that is also a branched cover of the standard minimal pattern on @xmath14 .",
    "the bound for @xmath80 is sharp .",
    "let @xmath17 be a finite football graph .",
    "as @xmath78 is a subgroup of index @xmath6 , the intersection @xmath99 has index at most @xmath6 in @xmath100 .",
    "the intersection corresponds to a covering of @xmath17 of degree @xmath98 that is also a covering of @xmath25 .    to prove that coverings of degree strictly less than @xmath6 do not always suffice ,",
    "recall that @xmath32 acts on the genus @xmath97 football graph @xmath17 from example  [ ex : symmetric - genus-24 ] .",
    "this is equivalent to the fundamental group @xmath100 being a normal subgroup of @xmath32 .",
    "the covering of @xmath17 corresponding to the subgroup @xmath101 of @xmath32 is a galois covering with galois group @xmath102 . now",
    "the injection @xmath103 induces an embedding of @xmath102 as a normal subgroup of the orientation - preserving icosahedral group @xmath79 , isomorphic to the alternating group @xmath104 . since this is a simple group we must have @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "the second case is excluded because @xmath17 is not a covering of @xmath25 .",
    "although we have modelled football patterns as ribbon graphs , we can also consider them on non - orientable surfaces , because the condition that every other edge emanating from a white vertex should connect to a black vertex is preserved by inversion of the cyclic order .    here are the simplest examples for the projective plane .    a football pattern on the real projective plane is readily constructed from the standard football . in the dual ribbon graph @xmath25 cut a single ribbon and",
    "reglue it with a half - twist so that the surface becomes non - orientable .",
    "this gives a football pattern with @xmath107 that , instead of the @xmath6 vertices of valence @xmath38 in the standard football , has @xmath83 vertices of valence @xmath38 and a unique vertex of valence @xmath35 . therefore the euler number of the surface is @xmath108 .    if we lift the pattern in this example to the universal covering of the projective plane , we obtain a football pattern with @xmath109 on the two - sphere , which , by theorem  [ t : main ] , is a @xmath37-fold branched cover of the standard pattern .",
    "of course in this case the branched covering structure can be seen directly , by focussing on the two vertices of valence @xmath35 .",
    "the usual symmetric realisation of the standard football pattern on the sphere as a truncated icosahedron is symmetric under the antipodal involution .",
    "thus it descends to a pattern on @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "in this section we consider generalisations of the traditional football patterns .",
    "a generalised football pattern is a map on the two - sphere whose faces are @xmath3-gons and @xmath4-gons satisfying the conditions that the edges of each @xmath3-gon meet only edges of @xmath4-gons , and that every @xmath8 edge of each @xmath4-gon meets an edge of a @xmath3-gon , and its other edges meet @xmath4-gons .",
    "if a given triple @xmath7 can be realised by a generalised football pattern , then it can be realised in infinitely many ways , for example by taking branched covers branched only in the vertices of a given pattern .",
    "we will determine all possible triples , and we will find a minimal realisation for each of them .",
    "we will also see that in some cases there are realisations that are not branched covers of the minimal one .",
    "[ ex : amfoot ] start with a subdivision of the sphere along @xmath112 halves of great circles running from the north to the south poles .",
    "we shall call this an american football .",
    "if we now truncate at one of the poles , we obtain a realisation of the triple @xmath120 .",
    "( for @xmath121 this is a tetrahedron . )",
    "if we truncate at both poles , we obtain a tin can pattern realising @xmath122 .",

    "( for @xmath126 we obtain a dodecahedron . )",
    "[ ex:3 ] take a platonic solid , and subdivide each face as follows .",
    "if the face is a @xmath3-gon , put a smaller @xmath3-gon in its interior , and radially connect each corner of this smaller @xmath3-gon to the corresponding corner of the original face .",

    "the cases @xmath121 and @xmath127 are shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .    next we erase the edges of the original polyhedron , so that the two quadrilaterals of the subdivison meeting along an edge are joined to form a hexagon . in this way",
    "we obtain a realisation of the triple @xmath128 .",

    "counting the edges in two different ways leads to @xmath186 .",
    "as every edge separates a black from a white polygon , there must be an even number of faces meeting at every vertex .",
