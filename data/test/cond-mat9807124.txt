    "since the discovery of large magnetoresistance ( mr ) at room temperature in la@xmath0ba@xmath1mno@xmath2 epitaxial thin films @xcite , there has been a resurgence of interest in doped perovskite manganate compounds .",
    "doped perovskite manganates in this case refers to the family of materials related to compounds with a chemical composition of a@xmath3b@xmath4mno@xmath2 , where a stands for trivalent rare - earth such as la , pr , etc . and",
    "b stands for divalent alkaline - earth elements , such as ba , sr , etc .",
    "materials refinements have revealed that very large magnetoresistances , of over three orders of magnitude change in resistance , can be observed in such compounds prepared through special heat - treatment @xcite .",
    "these materials have since been refered to as colossal magnetoresistance materials , or cmr materials .",
    "the large magnetoresistance effect in these compounds was referred to as cmr  effect .",
    "the physics of cmr  is complex due to the similar energy scales involved for interactions among the lattice , electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "the basic electronic interactions in these materials were investigated back in the fifties .",
    "the double - exchange model @xcite was proposed to explain the simultaneous onset of metallic conductivity and ferromagnetism as doping concentration @xmath5 is increased across the insulator - metal transition point of @xmath6 .",
    "it was also understood then that there is a strong correlation between the mn - o - mn bond length and bond angle and the magnetic coupling of adjacent mn ions @xcite .",
    "a jahn - teller distortion lifts the double - degeneracy of mn @xmath7-electrons @xmath8 orbitals , and provides a mechanism for strong coupling between the electronic , magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom . in bulk ceramic materials",
    "a jahn - teller distortion - related orthorombicity is present in la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 in the doping range of @xmath9.@xcite . above @xmath10 such static distortion of lattice",
    "is no longer observable .",
    "to explain the cmr effect , recently it was proposed that even for @xmath11 , dynamically fluctuating local jahn - teller distortion still exists , which provides a mechanism for the localization of ferromagnetic polarons @xcite . for cmr  materials at @xmath12 in temperatures above the curie point @xmath13 , these polarons are localized .",
    "electrical conduction occurs via hopping process . for temperatures well below @xmath13 on the other hand ,",
    "the electornic states appear more extended , and a band - like conduction is more appropriate .",
    "local spin - density approximation calculation @xcite has been carried out for la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 in the region @xmath14 .",
    "their results suggest an almost completely spin - polarized mn @xmath7-band",
    ". therefore these materials may behave as half - metals at temperatures below @xmath13 , and hence may exhibit a large spin - dependent conductance across a tunneling barrier @xcite .    for magnetic field - sensing applications ,",
    "low - field responsivity is necessary .",
    "large mr is desired in field ranges of tens to hundreds of oe .",
    "this presents a challenge for cmr materials , since cmr effect observed in the generic doped manganate perovskites involves a magnetic field above 1 tesla @xcite , and the low - field magnetoresistance in the field range of 10 - 100oe remains minimal .",
    "one might expect large spin - dependent conductivity across a macroscopic interface between two cmr electrodes across which the magnetization abruptly changes direction .",
    "this may either be due to local spin - dependent hopping , as prescribed by the double - exchange mechanism , or it maybe due to spin - dependent tunneling , if the interface is electrically insulating enough to behave as a tunneling barrier .",
    "such a macroscopic interface disrupts the magnetic exchange - coupling , so that easy rotation of magnetic moment from one electrode to the other can be obtained .",
    "three approaches have been taken to experimentally exploit this concept .",
    "the first approach is to use a crystalline grain - boundary as the interface , and study the spin - dependent transport across .",
    "the role of grain boundary in providing additional contributions to low - field magnetoresistance has long been suspected @xcite .",
    "direct experimental observation of grain - boundary - originated magnetoresistance has recently been made @xcite which shows a 30% magnetoresistance in a field of less than 500 oe .",
    "the second approach uses the naturally occuring inter - planar conductivity in the 2-dimensional version of the cmr  material la@xmath15sr@xmath16mn@xmath17o@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "they demonstarted a large magnetoresistance of 240% in less than 500oe at 4.2k , using the layered single crystal compound of la@xmath19sr@xmath20mn@xmath17o@xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "the transport direction was perpendicular to the planes of layering , and the authors argued that transport in this direction may be due to spin - dependent tunneling .",
    "the third approach makes use of thin film trilayer junctions , fabricated from epitaxial trilayer films to support current - perpendicular ( cpp ) transport .",
    "successful demonstration of large low - field magnetoresistance in cmr - based devices was first realized in such junctions @xcite .",
    "the devices are lithographically fabricated from la@xmath0(ca , sr)@xmath23mno@xmath2 - srtio@xmath2 - la@xmath0(ca , sr)@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo - sto - lsmo , or lcmo - sto - lcmo ) trilayer epitaxial thin films .",
    "the junctions show large low field magnetoresistance , of about a factor of two to five , in a field around 100oe at 4.2k .",
    "these results provide an existence proof that low - field cmr is possible .",
    "this paper focuses on experimental issues concerning spin - dependent transport in cmr trilayer junctions .",
    "a typical structure for thin film trilayer magnetic junction is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the junction is comprised of a top and a bottom magnetic electrode , made of epitaxial cmr  thin films .",
    "the two electrodes are separated in between by a thin layer of foreign material such as srtio@xmath2 , which disrupts the magnetic exchange coupling between the electrodes , and makes it possible to macroscopically rotate the magnetic moment of one electrode with respect to another .",
    "transport current is forced to flow perpendicular to barrier in the cpp geometry .",
    "if the barrier is thin enough , it will allow some passage of electrical current , either via metal - insulator - metal tunneling , or by some other more complex and inhomogeneous processes , such as defect - assisted hopping through the barrier .",
    "one hopes to directly observe spin - dependent transport across the barrier . by spin - dependent transport",
    "we mean that , on a macroscopic scale , the conductance across the barrier is dependent on the relative orientation of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) moments of the two electrodes .",
    "usually , the transport resistance across such a structure would be minimum when the two fm electrodes moments are parallel , and maximum when they are antiparallel .",
    "this is true in many mechanisms including spin - dependent tunneling , double - exchange - mediated nearest neighbor hopping , or in metallic two - channel spin - scattering limited conduction .",
    "when such a trilayer is subjected to an applied magnetic field , the junction resistance will show a particular type of field dependence .",
    "the junction stays in its low resistance state in sufficiently high field .",
    "but when the applied field is swept from its negative value to positive , one electrode will magnetically rotate before the other if the device is designed such that the two electrodes have different magnetic anisotropy .",
    "this will result in a momentary antiparallel arrangement of the relative moments across the barrier , and the junction resistance will register its high value in this field range .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig.[fig1](c ) .",
    "the conduction mechanism across the barrier layer can vary . in metal or alloy - based thin film trilayers ,",
    "several types of separation layers have been experimented with .",
    "the separation layer can either be a non - magnetic metal , as in the case of a spin - valve @xcite , or an insulator , as in spin - dependent tunneling @xcite .",
    "spin - dependent tunneling has been observed in elemental and alloy ferromagnetic metal electrode systems @xcite .",
    "there are still debates as to whether such type of tunneling should be observable in @xmath7-band dominant cmr materials @xcite , since @xmath7-electrons decay much more rapidly into the barrier than @xmath24-electrons @xcite .    for cmr  trilayers ,",
    "the most commonly used barrier material is a thin layer of epitaxial srtio@xmath2 film , 20 to 50  thick .",
    "the role of this barrier material is yet to be fully understood , as will be further discussed later .",
    "non - linear current - voltage characteristics have been observed in cmr - barrier - cmr junctions @xcite .",
    "these current - voltage ( @xmath25 ) characteristics appear roughly consistent with a metal - barrier - metal tunneling process . however , non - linear @xmath25 characteristic alone is insufficient for establishing a tunneling transport mechanism , and other mechanisms have been known to give rise to non - linear @xmath25s as well @xcite .",
    "the exact conduction mechanism in these cmr  junctions remains unclear at present .      in our lab",
    ", thin film trilayers were made using epitaxial la@xmath0sr@xmath23mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) electrodes and srtio@xmath2 ( sto ) barriers @xcite .",
    "briefly , epitaxial growth was achieved by using _ in situ _ pulsed - laser deposition .",
    "typical growth conditions included a substrate temperature of 600 to 800c , and an oxygen pressure of 300mtorr .",
    "a  nd - yag laser was used in its frequency tripled mode ( 355 nm ) at 10hz repetition . the laser intensity on target surface",
    "was estimated to be around 3 to 5 joules/@xmath26 .",
    "deposition was done using the sequence of 600  lsmo , followed by 20 to 50  of sto , followed again by 400  of lsmo .",
    "typical deposition rate for lsmo  was around 2.6 / sec , sto about 1.8 / sec .",
    "single crystal substrates of srtio@xmath2(100 ) , laalo@xmath2 ( 100 )  and ndgao@xmath2 ( 110 ) have all been used for experimentation . after deposition ,",
    "the substrate was cooled in 300torr of oxygen to room temperature in about 1 hr . a  thin layer of silver , typically 500  or less , was sputter deposited to the surface of the trilayer before it was taken out of the vacuum system for further processing .",
    "structurally , on the local scale of several thousand angstroms at least , the lsmo / sto / lsmo  interfaces are well - formed , and are free of gross defects .",
    "the continuation of epitaxial growth of lsmo  across the sto  barrier layer is confirmed by x - ray diffraction as well as by cross - sectional transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "a representative tem picture of the trilayer interface is shown in fig.[fig2 ] , in which case a coherent lattice fringe can be seen to carry across the sto  barrier layer from the bottom lsmo  to the top .",
    "optical photolithography was used to fabricate cpp  junctions from trilayers .",
    "the shape of the base - electrode layer was formed first , by ion milling through a photoresist stencil .",
    "ion milling was done using neutralized ar ions , 500ev , 0.3ma/@xmath27 , 45@xmath28 incidence angle . after stripping the resist ,",
    "a second resist pattern was put on , which defined the pillar structure forming the junctions . again",
    "ion milling was used , in this case to etch half way into the film , timed to stop immediately past the stobarrier layer , forming the pillar structure from the trilayers . a blanket sio@xmath17 layer , typically about 3000  thick ,",
    "was then sputter deposited on top , followed by a lift - off step that removes the resist layer on top of the pillars , opening up self - aligned holes for top metallic contact .",
    "a  layer of about 2000  sputtered gold was used for top contact , which was subsequently etched using yet another level of photoresist step , forming the cross - bar structure from which 4-probe measurements could be made of individual junction pillars underneath each gold contact bridge . a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of a typical device structure made with this process is shown in fig.[fig4 ] . to make certain",
    "there is no interdiffusion - related insulation problem between sio@xmath17 and gold , as well as for promoting adhesion , a thin layer of titanium , usually about 20 to 50   thick , was put down between the sio@xmath17 and the top gold layer .",
    "the quality of sio@xmath17 insulation was further confirmed by the consistency between results from devices fabricated using mgo insulation layer and from devices made using sio@xmath17 .",
    "two types of junction behaviors were observed .",
    "they can be classified according to their temperature dependence .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] presents a summary . in one type of junctions , typically with sto  barriers on the thicker side ( 30 to 50 ) ,",
    "the junction resistance increases with decreasing temperature , as shown in fig.[fig5](a ) .",
    "these typically involve junctions of sizes below 10@xmath29 , and are devices with the largest observed magnetoresistance at low temperatures . for this type of junctions ,",
    "the magnetic field dependence of junction resistance , @xmath30 , tends to be rather complex , an example is shown in fig.[fig5](b ) .",
    "another type of junctions , typically involving thinner sto  barriers ( below 30 ) , shows a decreasing junction resistance upon the lowering of sample temperature .",
    "these junctions often have cleaner , more reproducible @xmath30 loops , as shown in fig.[fig5](d ) .",
    "the interpretation of data from these low - resistance junctions is tricky , because the junction resistance could approach the base - electrode s sheet resistance . for a 600lsmo  base electrode with resistivity of @xmath31 to @xmath32 at 4.2k",
    ", we have a base - electrode @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "when junction resistance approaches that of @xmath35 , distributed voltage drop in the base electrode can no longer be ignored , and one has to be careful in distinguishing between true junction resistance and the apparent resistance caused by voltage distribution inside the base electrode @xcite .",
    "such artifacts can cause a superficially high value of magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "another difficulty in studying low resistance junctions has to do with sample heating .",
    "it is difficult to apply a large voltage across a low resistance junction without significantly heating up the _ junction area _ of the sample .",
    "perovskites such as srtio@xmath2 have relatively low thermal conductivity ( around 10 w / km for sto at room temperature , compared to about 144 w / km for single crystal silicon , for example .",
    "ndgao@xmath2 single crystal substrates have probably even lower thermal conductivity ) .",
    "therefore , sample heating can be significant on a local scale for the junction , even when the input power is insufficient to cause much observable heating over the chip ) .",
    "for these two reasons , most of our discussions will be focused on devices of the first type , namely the high resistance junctions whose resistance increase upon cooling of the sample , and whose resistance value is at least an order of magnitude larger than the base - electrode @xmath35 .      a  representative temperature dependence of junction resistance is shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "two regions of temperatures involving distinctively different junction behaviors can be identified . in the first region , typically between 130k and 300k , the junction resistance rises almost exponentially upon the decreasing of temperature , resembling a @xmath36 scaling relation commonly seen in systems exhibiting variable range hopping @xcite .",
    "a replot of the junction resistance vs. temperature data according to the scaling relation @xmath37 $ ] is shown in the inset of fig.[fig6 ] . in this region",
    "the magnetoresistance is minimal , typically less than 0.5% for a field sweep of couple of hundred oe .",
    "below 130k , the junction enters its second region , where the junction resistance is less sensitive to temperature variation .",
    "it becomes more noisy , and exhibits large magnetic field - exposure history dependence .",
    "this is the temperature region where large low - field magnetoresistance is observed .",
    "an example is shown in fig.[fig7 ] , where the junction resistance is measured as a function of sweeping magnetic field at a constant temperature of 4.2k .",
    "such response to sweeping magnetic field is expected conceptually from the simple two - fm - electrode junction picture as shown in fig.[fig1](c ) .",
    "details about the shape of the @xmath30 loops will be discussed in the next section , here we merely use fig.[fig7 ] to point out that the low - field magnetoresistance is large . for the junction shown here , a factor of 5 change in resistance",
    "is observed at a switching field of around 100 oe at 4.2k .",
    "this is the first observation of large mr  at low - fields in cmr  materials , proving that cmr  is not a phenomenon limited to high magnetic fields .",
    "we define two resistance values from data such as shown in fig.[fig7 ] , namely @xmath38 and @xmath39 , corresponding to the dc resistive high- and low - state of the junction .",
    "the magnetoresistance contrast can then be conveniently defined as @xmath40 , according to the conventions used in literatures .",
    "the temperature dependences of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 are shown in fig.[fig5 ] , fig.[fig6 ] and fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the magnetoresistance decreases with increasing temperature , and it disappears around 130k .",
    "this is well below the curie temperature @xmath13 of the thin film material which is close to the resistance peak temperature .",
    "the resistance peak temperature of the base electrode is shown in fig.[fig8 ] to be above 300k .",
    "separate measurements confirm the base - electrode s resistance peaks around 350 - 360k .",
    "clearly , something other than the film s @xmath13 is limiting the upper temperature of the junction magnetoresistance .",
    "the high temperature behavior of junction resistance as shown in fig.[fig6 ] may suggest defect - assisted hopping as a possible conduction mechanism across the sto  barrier .",
    "indeed such temperature dependence of resistance is common in oxide perovskite semiconductors having a large population of defect sites .",
    "the defect assisted conduction process may provide additional high temperature conduction channels that progressively shunt out the direct , spin - dependent conduction process manifested at low temperatures . for this scenario to work , the defect - assisted hopping has to have a large spin - flipping rate , because the high temperature conduction apparently has lost all spin - dependence information , judging from its minimal value of magnetoresistance .",
    "there are other possibilities for a premature decrease of magnetoresistance .",
    "spin - dependent transport across a trilayer is sensitive to interface magnetic states which may be different from that deep inside the film .",
    "this may be caused by a reduced magnetic coupling at the interface , by a discontinuous electronic structure , or by interface diffusion or oxygen deficiency .",
    "a different stress environment at the interface may cause change in electrode s magnetic states .",
    "excitation of surface magnons have also been suggested as a possible source for the suppression of magnetoresistance , both for high temperature and for elevated junction bias@xcite .",
    "the magnetic coercivity of 33%-doped lsmo  thin films is of the order of 100 to 200 oe at helium temperature @xcite . in cmr",
    "junctions , the situation is more complex .",
    "additional magnetic interactions need to be considered .",
    "four major contributors are : the shape anisotropy of the junction pillar , the edge - coupling , the dipolar coupling across a rough junction interface , and the magnetostriction - induced anisotropy .",
    "the complexity of magnetic states in the junction pillar is apparent from our measurement such as data shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "junctions with high resistance have more complex @xmath30 loops . in fig.[fig9 ] , @xmath30 loops from two junctions of different resistance are compared to the magnetic hysteresis loop of a blank film of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath42 .",
    "the top panel shows a representative magnetic hysteresis loop taken on a blank la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 epitaxial film .",
    "the middle panel ( b ) shows the @xmath30 loop for a low - resistasnce junction .",
    "the switching field for this type of junction agrees well with that of the coercivity of the blank film .",
    "the lower panel ( c ) shows the @xmath30 loop of a high - resistance junction . here",
    "the lower switching field agrees well with the magnetic coercivity of the blank thin film .",
    "however , the upper switching field is significantly above the coercivity of the blank film .",
    "this suggests the presence of magnetic states with enhanced magnetic anisotropy , be it from shape , strain , or interface coupling .",
    "the @xmath30 curves for high - resistance junctions are noisy and often show preferred multiple discrete resistance values , suggesting the switching of multiple magnetic domains inside the electrodes . over the many junctions we have measured to date ,",
    "a wide variety of magnetic behaviors have been seen .",
    "fig.[fig10 ] shows some other @xmath30 loops with complex magnetic structures .",
    "apparently , much better understanding and control of the electrode s magnetic state is necessary .",
    "it is also possible that part of the @xmath30 loop complexities comes from magnetic defect - sites inside the barrier , rather than from the magnetic states of the electrodes alone .",
    "barrier - related magnetic defects has been shown in small ( @xmath4380 nm diameter ) ni - nio - co junctions to cause magnetic field - dependent fluctuations that can lead to large apparent magnetoresistance at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "non - linear @xmath25 characteristics are present in all junctions that show large magnetoresistance .",
    "following definitions similar to that from fig.[fig7 ] , at a given bias current for a junction we define @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the high- and low - voltage state corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we trace @xmath44 and @xmath45 as a function of bias current , and the resulting two branches of the @xmath25 characteristics and the bias - dependent magnetoresistance ratio @xmath41 are shown in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "the two branches of @xmath25s show pronounced non - linearity . at the same time the magnetoresistance ratio shows a bias - dependence , with the contrast @xmath41 decreasing as junction bias is increased .",
    "this behavior is similar to what is observed in metal - based magnetic tunneling junctions @xcite , although the characteristic voltage scale for the reduction of magnetoresistance is at least a factor of 3 to 5 smaller than in the case of metal junctions such as cofe / al@xmath17o@xmath2/co @xcite .",
    "the bias - dependent junction transport can be further examined by plotting the differential junction conductance as a function of bias voltage .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig12 ] , where the specific differential junction conductance is plotted as a function of junction bias , showing a relatively sharp conductance minimum at low - bias riding on top of a more gradually rising high - bias conductance slope .",
    "the origin of this characteristic is not well understood .",
    "it is more complex than one would expect from a simple metal - insulator - metal tunneling junction as the simmons tunneling model @xcite would predict ( dotted lines ) .",
    "more knowledge about the barrier and the interface states of the cmr  materials is necessary .",
    "cmr  trilayer junctions fabricated to date show large amount of inhomogeneities .",
    "junction conductance in most cases do not scale with junction area in any simple way .",
    "this is evident in data presented in fig.[fig12 ] .",
    "if the junction conductances were to scale with the area , one would expect all specific conductance curves to be roughly the same in value . instead in fig.[fig12 ] the specific conductance increases with increasing junction size .",
    "fig.[fig13 ] shows two sets of junction resistances as a function of pillar size for two rows of junctions on one chip .",
    "a clear cross - over from high junction resistance to low junction resistance can been seen as the junction dimension is increased beyond a cross - over region between 2 and 10@xmath46 m .",
    "this indicates non - uniform conduction over the junction area , where high conductance paths are small in area compared to junction sizes , and they distribute with a mean distance on the order of 2 to 10@xmath46 m .",
    "pinhole conduction is a possibility , at least for junctions of the size above the cross - over dimension .",
    "the mr of manganate junctions appears to correlate to junction resistance .",
    "fig.[fig14 ] shows data obtained on several manganate junction chips .",
    "the junction magnetoresistance ratio @xmath47 is plotted against the specific junction resistance on a log - log plot .",
    "these data appear bunched into a cone boardered on the high mr  end by a line of slope @xmath48 , and on the low mr  end by a line of slope of about @xmath49 .",
    "a slope - equal - to-1 corrlation could indicate the presence of a parallel shunt that is magnetoresistively inactive .",
    "the meaning of the lower - bound line is not clear .",
    "the presence of inhomogeneity further complicates the nature of conduction across these cmr  junctions .",
    "although the non - linear @xmath25s from these devices can be roughly described by the simmons tunneling formula , it is dangerous to conclude that such fits lead to any insight of the barrier physics or the nature of the junction .",
    "fig.[fig15 ] shows a collection of the apparent barrier thickness @xmath50 and barrier height @xmath51 extracted from fitting simmons model to various cmr junction @xmath25s obtained at 4.2k .",
    "the values of @xmath52 appears to form a correlation defined by @xmath53 .",
    "this apparent correlation as it turns out is a sure sign that we are not looking at clean tunnling junctions but rather are just parameterizing a complex non - linear device with a functional form of the simmons formula .",
    "a more quantitative analysis is given in the appendix .",
    "large low - field magnetoresistance is demonstrated in cmr  trilayer junctions at temperatures below 130k .",
    "for the first time in cmr materials system a large magnetoresistance of a factor of 5 is observed in an applied field around @xmath54 oe .",
    "this provides an existence proof that cmr  effect can be obtained in low - fields .",
    "non - linear @xmath25 characteristics and bias - dependent magnetoresistances have been observed in cmr  trilayer junctions .",
    "these behaviors are qualitatively similar to what was observed in metal - insulator - metal spin - dependent tunneling systems .",
    "much of the physics for cmr junctions remains to be explored .",
    "the major experimental challenge is to master the materials science in the preparation of a well controlled , well characterized barrier interface , so that transport over the junction region could be more uniform , which will then allow more quantitative examination of the transport process .    the control of the electrodes magnetic state requires more study .",
    "better control of the shape of the junction pillar is needed to assure a reproducible micromagnetic boundary condition .",
    "one particular issue is the control of the amount of over etch during the fabrication of the pillar , as illustrated in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "because the over - etch step height determines to a large degree the amount of anti - parallel coupling the two fm  electrodes have .",
    "also necessary is a controlled pre - setting of the magnetic easy - axis for the manganates . in most devices studied so far",
    ", the magnetic easy - axis is uncontrolled .",
    "that contributes to the observed complexity of magnetic states .",
    "further , exchange - biasing of the manganate electrode could be looked into , since that could significantly simplify the micromagnetics of the trilayer junction structure , and make its response to applied magnetic field more predictable .",
    "the control of magnetic state is particularly important in cmr  junctions . because of its large magnetoresistance",
    ", detailed transport study is possible only when there is a stable and well - controlled magnetic state .",
    "the low - field magnetoresistance in trilayer cmr  junctions tends to vanish at temperatures around @xmath55 to @xmath56k , well below the curie temperature of the electrodes which is around @xmath57 to @xmath58k .",
    "the reason for this is not understood at present .    from an applications point of view",
    ", one would like to extend the temperature range for large magnetoresistance .",
    "room temperature operation of large low - field cmr  has not been demonstrated at this point , although cmreffects of @xmath59 in @xmath60 tesla has been seen in la@xmath0ba@xmath61mno@xmath2 epitaxial thin films @xcite .",
    "materials stability , device yield and compatibility to existing circuit fabrication processes are all issues that need to be resolved .",

    "the problem is , these @xmath52 do not have the same physical meaning as they do in the simmons model eqn.([e1 ] ) .    to see this",
    "let us create a situation where a real junction can be represented by an ideal simmons junction with @xmath69 defined according to eqn.([e1 ] ) .",
    "assume the real junction has parasitic @xmath70 and @xmath24 and its @xmath25 can be described by eqn.([e3 ] ) . what happens if we use the ideal junction formula , eqn.([e1 ] ) , to fit the real junction s @xmath71 as defined by eqn.([e3 ] ) ?",
    "the fit will give an apparent @xmath52 described by the minimization condition of :                    with @xmath77 and @xmath78 defined by @xmath69 through eqn.([e2b ] ) .",
    "so the real junction will also fit the ideal simmons model eqn.([e1 ] ) reasonably well , but with an off - set to parameters @xmath79 , thus to @xmath52 .",
    "it is therefore very misleading to use the definition of eqn.([e1 ] ) to interpret @xmath52 and infer from that anything about the barrier height and barrier thickness .",
    "what makes matter worse is such fits based on eqn.([e1 ] ) seem to give reasonable values for @xmath52 .",
    "the reason behind this is the strongly exponential dependence of the apparent conductance on @xmath80 in eqn.([e1 ] ) .",
    "many non - linear odd - function @xmath25 characteristics can be expanded to @xmath81 and be assigned an @xmath82 to the junction conductance @xmath83 .",
    "an @xmath24 thus defined would give a value to @xmath80 according to eqn.([e2b ] ) .",
    "assume @xmath84 for simplicity ,      the value of @xmath86 @xmath87m@xmath88 is large compared to typical conductance @xmath24 ( usually around @xmath89m@xmath88 ) for any reasonable barrier thickness @xmath50 , therefore it is self - consistent to assume a large @xmath80 limit .",
    "there the dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath24 is logarithmic , @xmath90 and to the first order self - consistently gives @xmath91 \\sim",
    "\\frac{\\xi h}{4\\pi \\left ( 2m\\right ) ^{1/2 } }   \\label{e8}\\ ] ] where @xmath92is a numerical factor around @xmath93 , related to a reasonable thickness estimate by :        this can also be observed by numerically evaluating eqn.([e8 ] ) .",
    "to do so we define @xmath99 m , @xmath100 j , and using @xmath101 j sec , @xmath102 coulomb , @xmath103 kg , @xmath104 @xmath87m@xmath88 , we have for @xmath105 in   and @xmath106 in ev :        which sets one constrain",
    ". a specific set of @xmath52 is then obtained by moving along this constrain ( to satisfy linear conductance value ) until it finds an approximate descrition for the leading non - linear term as described by @xmath109 in eqn.([e4b ] ) .",
    "different junctions and samples may have different ratio for first and third order expansion coefficients , that leads to a set of apparent @xmath52 that scatters roughly along the constrain eqn.([e8 ] ) .",
    "this is what we saw from our experimental fits , as shown in fig.[fig15 ] .",
    "so be very careful when using simmons formula to fit experimental @xmath25 curves .",
    "if there s inhomogeneity or parallel shunt conductances present , the apparent barrier height and thickness do not represent the values for the tunneling barrier ."
