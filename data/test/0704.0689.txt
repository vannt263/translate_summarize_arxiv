    "the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) were firstly discovered in sco x-1 , a luminous z source in neutron star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( e.g. van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ) , and now they have been detected in twenty more sources ( e.g. van der klis 2000 , 2006 , for reviews ) . usually , these khz qpos appear in pairs , the upper khz qpo frequency ( @xmath3 , hereafter the upper - frequency ) and the lower khz qpo frequency ( @xmath4 , hereafter the lower - frequency ) , which are discovered in three classes of sources , i.e. accretion powered millisecond pulsars , bright z sources and less luminous atoll sources ( e.g. , hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .    the khz qpo peak separation , @xmath5 , in a given source generally decreases with frequency , except the recently detected khz qpos in cir x-1 , in which the peak separation increases with frequency ( boutloukos et al .",
    "in addition , the variable peak separations are not equal to the ns spin frequencies .",
    "however , the averaged peak separation is found to be either close to the spin frequency or to half of it ( e.g. , van der klis 2006 ; linares et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the above observations offer strong evidence against the simple beat - frequency model , in which the lower - frequency is the beat between the upper - frequency @xmath3 and the ns spin frequency @xmath6 ( e.g. strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ; miller et al . 1998 ) , i.e. @xmath7 . furthermore , with the discovery of pairs of 30450 hz qpos from a few black - hole candidates with the frequency ratios 3:2 ( e.g. , van der klis 2006 ) , abramowicz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported that the ratios of twin khz qpos in sco x-1 tend to cluster around a value about 3:2 , and they argued this fact to be a promising link with the black hole high - frequency qpos ( e.g. van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "for the all z and atoll sources , the data plots of the upper - frequency versus the lower - frequency can be fitted by a power law function ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2006a ) , and also roughly fitted by a linear function ( belloni et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , for the individual khz qpo source , for instance sco x-1 , its khz qpos can be well fitted by a power law function ( e.g. psaltis et al .",
    "1998 ; yin et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this paper , to investigate the twin khz qpo correlation for the individual z or atoll source , we fitted the data with a power - law and a linear function for four typical z sources and four typical atoll sources , and a comparison of both fittings by @xmath2-tests is discussed in section 2 , where comparisons with the models are discussed .",
    "the conclusions and consequences are given in section 3 .",
    "until now , twin khz qpos have been detected in 21 lmxbs , including 2 accretion powered millisecond x - ray pulsars , 8 z sources and 11 atoll sources , as listed in tab .",
    "1 . in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 , we plotted twin khz qpo data for the z sources and atoll sources , showing the correlations of @xmath4 vs. @xmath3 , @xmath8 vs. @xmath3 and @xmath9 vs. @xmath3 , where the power - law and linear fitting lines for the eight z and atoll sources are presented .",
    "the results of the fittings and @xmath10 are listed in tab .",
    "the power - law function is chosen as @xmath11 to fit twin khz qpo data points of all atoll ( z ) sources , as well as 4 individual atoll ( z ) sources , separately .",
    "it is noted that a same function was applied to the fitting of khz qpos of sco x-1 by psaltis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with a smaller set of khz qpo data points .",
    "the fitting results of the normalization coefficient @xmath12 , the power - law index @xmath13 and @xmath14 for various cases are listed in tab .",
    "2 , which correspond to the fitting curves as presented in fig .",
    "we find that the power - law index for the fitting of all z sources ( see tab .",
    "2 ) is 1.87 , obviously bigger than that of the fitting for all atoll sources ( 1.61 ) .",
    "then , for the individual case , the power - law index for z source is generally bigger than that in atoll source , except gx 17 + 2 .",
    "for the same data sets , the linear fitting function is chosen as , @xmath15 which was exploited by belloni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to discuss the khz qpo fitting in sco x-1 , 4u 1608 - 52 , 4u 1636 - 53 , 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 1820 - 30 . by means of the @xmath10 , as shown in tab .",
    "2 , we find that the linear fitting concordes with the data well in some cases , and there is no much systematic difference between the linear slope parameters of the atoll sources and those of z sources .      as a comparison between models and the data ,",
    "it is remarked that the relativistic precession model ( e.g. stella & vietri 1999 ) and the alfvn wave oscillation model ( e.g. zhang 2004 ; li & zhang 2005 ) both can lead to power - law relations approximately , and then the beat - frequency model ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "1998 ) and the 3:2 resonance model ( e.g. abramowicz et al .",
    "2003 , this model is successfully applied to black hole candidates ) predicted the linear relations between twin khz qpo frequencies in the lowest approximation ( abramowicz et al .",
    "2005 ) . in tab .",
    "2 , we can see that the @xmath14 of the power - law relation is usually less than the linear one for the same source , except the two atoll sources 4u 0614 + 09 and 4u 1636 - 53 . and",
    "a linear function can not give a firstly increasing and then decreasing tendency of all z data as shown in fig .",
    "but a power - law one would fit it well as shown in fig .",
    "so , these maybe mean that a power - law correlation is better than a linear one .",
    "since the discovery of khz qpos , it is known that the peak separation for sco x-1 ( van der klis et al 1997 ; mndez & van der klis 2000 ) is a not constant , and the same is true for the other z sources , e.g. , gx 17 + 2 ( homan et al .",
    "2002 ) and cir x-1 ( boutloukos 2006 ) . as for the atoll sources , the peak separation of 4u  172834 ( migliari , van der klis , & fender 2003",
    "; mndez & van der klis 1999 ) is always significantly lower than the burst oscillation frequency , and the peak separation of 4u  163653 ( jonker , mndez , & van der klis 2002b ; mndez , van der klis , & van paradijs 1998 ) is varying between being lower and higher than half the spin frequency .",
    "in addition , 4u 1608 - 52 ( mndez et al . 1998 ) and 4u 1735 - 44 ( ford et al .",
    "1998 ) are found to share the varied peak separations .    in fig .",
    "1b or fig . 2b",
    ", we show that the peak separations in all z sources decrease ( increase ) systematically with the upper frequency if the upper frequency is larger ( less ) than @xmath17700 hz ( e.g. van der klis 2000 , 2006 ; boutloukos et al .",
    "2006 ) . but",
    "this firstly increasing and then decreasing with frequency is not clearly found for the khz qpo data of all atoll sources , as shown in fig .",
    "1e and fig .",
    "2e , which perhaps is on account of the less amount of data in the low khz qpo frequencies in atoll sources . from fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , we find that the peak separations are scattered in a wide range of frequency for each source .",
    "therefore , a constant peak separation , i.e. @xmath18 , can not fit for these data .",
    "3 shows the results of @xmath2-tests against a general constant peak separation of the twin khz qpos in the 8 individual sources .",
    "the minimum @xmath14 are all with values @xmath19 1 , which means that any constant peak separation model can not fit for these data anymore .      from fig .",
    "1f ) or fig . 2c ( fig .",
    "2f ) , we find that twin frequency ratios distribute in a wide range from 1.2 to 4.2 , with the averaged value 1.73 ( 1.50 ) for all known z ( atoll ) data .",
    "obviously , a constant ratio @xmath20 , which can be applicable to some black hole qpo sources , is not consistent with the observed ns / lmxb data .",
    "in the @xmath21 plots of fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 , the frequency ratios systematically decrease with the upper - frequency for both z and atoll sources . in detail",
    ", the incompatible 3:2 ratio peak distribution has been also studied by belloni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in several sources , who showed that the distribution of qpo frequencies in sco x-1 , 4u 160852 , 4u 163653 , 4u 172834 , and 4u 182030 is multi - peaked , with the peaks occurring at the different @xmath22 ratios .",
    "in this paper , the updated data sets of twin khz qpo frequencies simultaneously detected in ns lmxbs are analyzed , and the power - law and linear fittings are studied for the individual z / atoll and all z / atoll sources , respectively .",
    "our main conclusions are presented as follows .",
    "( 1)in fig.1 and fig.2 , we can notice that a simple constant peak separation model , such as the beat - frequency model ( e.g. strohmayer et al . 1996 ; zhang et al . 1997 ; miller et al . 1998 ) , or a constant peak ratio assumption , as in a naive extrapolation of the observed resonant frequency ratio from the black hole sources to the neutron stars ( e.g. abramowicz et al . 2003 ) , can not fit the observed data .",
    "namely , any simple constant peak separation and constant peak ratio models are generally inconsistent with the data .",
    "the peak separations in all z sources tend to increase ( decrease ) with the upper - frequency if the upper - frequency is less ( larger ) than @xmath17700 hz . but this tendency does not appear in all atoll sources because of less amount of data at low khz qpo frequency .",
    "statistically , the twin frequency ratios tend to decrease with the upper - frequency in both z and atoll sources .",
    "( 2)our results show that the index of the fitted power - law relation of z source is generally bigger than that of atoll source , except gx 17 + 2 . on the consideration of model , this different index value in z and atoll sources",
    "might be related to the diversity in their luminosity or magnetic field .",
    "however the linear correlations do not show any systematic differences between z and atoll sources .",
    "( 3)the power - law fitting is somewhat better than the linear one for most of the sources , because the @xmath14 value of the power - law correlation is generally less than that of linear one , and a linear correlation can not give the firstly increasing and then decreasing tendency of peak separations in all z data . as a comparison with model s prediction ,",
    "we mention the relativistic precession model ( e.g. stella & vietri 1999 ) and the alfvn wave oscillation model ( zhang 2004 ) , since both models can give an approximated power - law correlation between the twin khz qpos , however none of them can distinguish the influences of the luminosity of z and atoll sources . as a summary ,",
    "if the future data still support the conclusions obtained in the paper , they will pose the meaningful constraints on the models for explaining khz qpos .",
