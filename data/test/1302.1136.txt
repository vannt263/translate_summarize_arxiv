    "<S> analysis of a database of solar coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) and associated flares over the period 1996 - 2007 finds well - behaved power law relationships between the 18    flare x - ray fluence and cme mass and kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate these relationships to lower and higher flare energies to estimate the mass and energy loss due to cmes from stellar coronae , assuming that the observed x - ray emission of the latter is dominated by flares with a frequency as a function of energy @xmath0 . for solar - like stars at saturated levels of x - ray activity , the implied losses depend fairly weakly on the assumed value of @xmath1 and are very large : @xmath2  yr@xmath3 and @xmath4 . in order to avoid such large energy requirements </S>",
    "<S> , either the relationships between cme mass and speed and flare energy must flatten for x - ray fluence @xmath5  erg , or the flare - cme association must drop significantly below 1 for more energetic events . </S>",
    "<S> if active coronae are dominated by flares , then the total coronal energy budget is likely to be up to an order of magnitude larger than the canonical @xmath6 x - ray saturation threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of what is the maximum energy a magnetic dynamo can extract from a star ? for an energy budget of 1%  of @xmath7 , the cme mass loss rate is about @xmath8  yr@xmath3 . </S>"
