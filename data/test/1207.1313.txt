    "the standard model of elementary particles ( sm ) has been amazingly successful , and currently the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment is searching for higgs boson , which is the only particle that has not been observed yet in the framework of the sm . so far , some interesting hints of the higgs boson with a mass of about 125 gev have been reported at the lhc  @xcite and its discovery may not be in a far future .",
    "the higgs boson with a mass of about 100 gev is totally consistent with the electroweak ( ew ) precision measurements .",
    "therefore , the sm well - describes the nature up to the ew scale .",
    "we , however , think that the sm is not the final theory of elementary particles .",
    "the hierarchy problem has been a strong driving force to think of the physics beyond the sm , and many ideas , such as supersymmetry , extra - dimension , and technicolor , have been proposed to solve the problem .",
    "the lhc experiment is an ideal place to probe the models for the hierarchy problem , and the searches are currently going on .",
    "the first round of the lhc searches , however , does not show any serious deviations from the sm prediction .",
    "it seems that this negative search result starts creating a tension between new physics models and the requirements for the hierarchy problem",
    ". therefore it will be good time to consider other approaches to think about new physics beyond the sm .",
    "there is a different approach to consider the physics beyond the sm , based on a consideration for unexplained experimental results .",
    "the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon g-2 ) is one of the most precisely measured observables  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction from the sm by several groups has suggested that there is a discrepancy between the experimental result and the sm prediction  @xcite :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is a discrepancy between the experimental result @xmath7 and the sm prediction @xmath8 .",
    "there are many discussions  @xcite on uncertainties of the sm prediction to understand whether this anomaly is real or not .",
    "if the discrepancy can not be explained by the sm , this would be an evidence of the physics beyond the sm . at present",
    ", there seems no satisfactory explanation for this anomaly within the sm .",
    "therefore , it is worth while considering the physics beyond the sm seriously in order to explain the anomaly .",
    "it is interesting to note that the anomaly of muon g-2 is the same size as 1-loop contributions induced by the ew gauge bosons in the sm .",
    "this suggests that in order to explain the anomaly , new particles with masses of ew scale are required if the interactions are of order of ew gauge couplings .",
    "although the anomaly of muon g-2 has been discussed in the context of new physics models ( for example , see ref .",

    "@xcite in little higgs model ) motivated mainly by the hierarchy problem , we take a `` bottom - up '' style approach . starting from introducing new interactions with muon to generate new contribution to muon g-2 , we try to capture important features of new physics models , although we can only discuss a part of complete models . in this paper",
    ", we consider models where muon has new yukawa type interactions with new particles to generate new contributions to muon g-2 .",
    "we find that in a model where the chirarity flip of muon occurs only in external line of muon g-2 diagrams , it is necessary to introduce the relatively large yukawa coupling and the ew scale new particles . on the other hand , in a model where the chirality flip can happen in the internal lines of muon g-2 diagrams",
    ", we can obtain favorable g-2 contributions without large yukawa couplings , and they are also consistent with the precision ew observables .",
    "we also expect these particles may be observed directly and/or indirectly at the lhc experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider new physics models where muon has new yukawa couplings to explain the anomaly of muon g-2 .",
    "one model is that only right - handed muon has new yukawa coupling .",
    "another one is that both right- and left- handed muons have new yukawa interactions to enhance the contributions to the muon g-2 .",
    "we show the consistent region of parameter space . in sec .  3 , we discuss effects of the new physics on ew observables and whether the parameter space which is consistent with the muon g-2 is also consistent with the precision measurements . in sec .  4 , we discuss phenomenology of these new physics models at the lhc .",
    "especially we show the possible effect on the higgs boson decay of @xmath1 , and the direct production cross sections of new particles at the lhc .",
    "is devoted to summary .",
    "in order to explain the deviation from the sm prediction of muon g-2 by new physics , muon has to have new interactions with some charged particles . since the effective operator for muon g-2 couples to photon , the loop effects via the new interactions of muon with charged particles could induce the extra contribution to the muon g-2 .    in this paper , as such new interactions",
