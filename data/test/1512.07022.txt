    "self - affine sets , both deterministic and random , have received substantial attention over the past three decades . far from being an exhausted topic ,",
    "self - affine sets are still not well understood and much progress has been made in recent years .",
    "of special interest are the dimensional and measure theoretic properties of these sets , analysing their geometric scaling properties . generally speaking one would expect the hausdorff , packing and box - counting dimension to coincide with a quantity called the ` affinity dimension ' .",
    "recent research has focussed on conditions under which the dimensions coincide or what is necessary to cause a ` dimension drop ' . in this paper",
    "we establish the almost sure box - counting dimension of two random models of self - affine box - like carpets in the sense of fraser  @xcite . before stating our results in detail , which include homogeneous , random recursive , and fractal percolation of self - affine carpets , we give a brief history of both deterministic and random self - affine sets .",
    "let @xmath2 be a ( complete ) compact metric space .",
    "let @xmath3 be strictly contracting self maps for some finite index set @xmath4 .",
    "the ( deterministic ) attractor @xmath5 of the iterated function system ( ifs ) @xmath6 is the unique compact non - empty set satisfying the invariance ( see hutchinson  @xcite ) , @xmath7 restricting the functions @xmath8 to contracting similitudes , one obtains the class of self - similar sets .",
    "much is known about these and we refer the reader to falconer  @xcite and the many references contained therein . here",
    "we are specifically concerned with the class of self - affine carpets .",
    "these are the attractors of finite ifss where @xmath9 are affine contractions on @xmath10 mapping the two coordinate axes onto themselves .",
    "for a comprehensive survey of deterministic self - affine sets we refer the reader to falconer  @xcite but briefly comment that the study of self - affine carpets started with bedford  @xcite and mcmullen  @xcite who determined , independently , the hausdorff and box - counting dimension of carpets with mappings that map the unit square onto subrectangles obtained by dividing the unit square into an @xmath11 grid , see figure  [ bedfordfengfraserpic ]  ( left - most ) .",
    "several generalisations were considered by lalley and gatzouras  @xcite , baraski  @xcite , and feng and wang  @xcite , analysing their dimensional properties .",
    "fraser  @xcite ,  @xcite extended the class to self - affine carpets with ifss mapping the unit square into rectangles such that any horizontal or vertical lines get mapped to horizontal or vertical lines , see figure  [ bedfordfengfraserpic ] .",
    "several random variants have been considered ; falconer  @xcite considered deterministic self - affine sets with randomly chosen translation vectors and showed that the hausdorff dimension coincides almost surely ( with respect to the chosen translation vectors ) with the ` affinity dimension ' .",
    "the affinity dimension can be considered the ` best guess ' for the hausdorff , packing and box - counting dimension of self - affine sets and it is of major current interest to establish exactly when these notion do , or do not , coincide .",
    "jordan , pollicott and simon  @xcite , and jordan and jurga  @xcite studied limit sets with random perturbations of the translation ( ` noise ' ) at every level of the construction , recovering the same coincidence with the affinity dimension .",
    "fraser and shmerkin  @xcite considered a bedford - mcmullen construction with random translation vectors that keep the column structure intact . under these conditions they showed that the hausdorff dimension is strictly less than the affinity dimension , an observation known as a ` dimension drop ' .",
    "a @xmath0-variable version ( homogeneously random ) of bedford - mcmullen carpets was considered by gui and li  @xcite who showed that the hausdorff and box - counting dimension of @xmath0-variable attractors equals the expectation of the dimension of the individual attractors , when all ifs have the same subdivision parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we will show in corollary  [ expectationcor ] that this holds in a more general setting for the box dimension , but fails e.g.  by simply choosing different subdivisions @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the bedford - mcmullen type ifss that make up the @xmath0-variable rifs .",
    "gatzouras and lalley  @xcite on the other hand were interested in percolation of bedford - mcmullen carpets , which are @xmath1-variable random ifs , also covered in this article .",
    "jrvenp et al .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite also considered a general model ( code - tree fractals ) that overlaps somewhat with the random model in this paper .",
    "however they consider random translations in their construction and recover almost sure coincidence with the affinity dimension .",
    "here we compute the box - counting dimension of random box - like sets without necessarily randomising the translation vectors and thus our results can be used to determine conditions for which there is a ` dimension drop ' where hausdorff and affinity dimension do not coincide almost surely .",
    "one of the key elements of our proofs is a recent result obtained by troscheit  @xcite stating that self - similar @xmath0-variable and @xmath1-variable random graph directed ( rgds ) systems have equal hausdorff and box - counting dimension almost surely .",
    "this is relevant as the projections of random self - affine box - like sets onto the horizontal and vertical axes are self - similar rgdss .",
    "this article is structured as follows ; in section  [ notation ] we introduce most basic notation common to @xmath0-variable and @xmath1-variable carpets .",
    "section  [ 1varsect ] contains our results for random homogeneous ( @xmath0-variable ) attractors and section  [ inftyvarres ] contains our results for random recursive , or @xmath1-variable , carpets .",
    "this is followed by some examples in section  [ sec : examples ] , while all proofs are contained in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of the box - counting dimension of a set .",
    "let @xmath16 be a totally bounded subset of a complete metric space @xmath17 . denote by @xmath18 the least number of sets of diameter @xmath19 or less needed to cover @xmath20 .",
    "the upper box counting dimension and lower box counting dimension are defined , respectively , by @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 we will refer to the box - counting dimension @xmath24 .",
    "note that the definition does not change if @xmath18 is substituted by @xmath25 , the number of grid squares in a @xmath26-mesh that intersect @xmath20 .",
    "we shall make use of this fact in proving the upper bound later . more equivalent definitions of box - counting dimension , and the definition of the hausdorff dimension can be found in falconer  @xcite .",
