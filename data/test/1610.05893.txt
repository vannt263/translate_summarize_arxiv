    "magnesium is a key element in the universe , and plays a significant part in various astrophysical applications . as a typical @xmath2-element",
    ", magnesium is mostly produced by type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "thus , it is a good tracer to study @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis . unlike fe , prone to be affected by type - ia snae nucleosynthesis , magnesium is a reliable reference element for the early evolution of the milky way @xcite . @xcite and @xcite recommended mg instead of iron as a reference element to investigate the evolution of different abundance ratios , while si and ca are more easily influenced by mixing and fallback episodes and possible contributions . @xcite",
    "applied [ mg / fe ] as a reference to explore thick- and thin - disk stars , and found there is a distinct behavior between the two populations .",
    "next to fe , mg is an important donor of free electrons in relatively cool turnoff stellar atmospheres , and contributes significant ultraviolet ( uv ) opacity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is one of the best observed elements , inasmuch as several strong mg lines are easily observed in visible and infrared regions in a to late - type stars .    in the last decades",
    ", many studies have determined lte mg abundances and have used this element as a tracer to probe the chemical evolution history of our galaxy , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that mg abundances may be impacted by nlte effects . at the end of 1960s ,",
    "@xcite first included nlte effects in the analysis of b lines in the sun based on a small atomic model .",
    "many subsequent studies have focused on investigating the nlte effects on line formation , e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite carefully investigated nlte effects for lines in the sun and ten cool stars , and found the abundance corrections in the sun to be negligible , while they can reach @xmath3 0.1dex in metal - deficient stars .",
    "they found that the corrections increase with decreasing metallicity , which was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the latter authors derived nlte abundances of na , mg and al for a sample of 55 nearby metal - poor stars , and concluded that the ratio of [ al / mg ] is a promising discriminant between thick - disk and halo stellar populations . for extremely metal - poor stars ,",
    "@xcite studied the nlte line formation for mg , and they argued that nlte effects could , at least partly , explain the unexpected scatter of [ x / mg ] found by @xcite and @xcite , and the different behaviors between dwarfs and giants described in @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite improved the mg atomic model by introducing the newly calculated inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen from @xcite , which were based on quantum mechanical computations , and verified that the updated atomic data can improve the determinations of mg abundances for late - type stars .",
    "her results were confirmed by @xcite , who produced a novel model atom of mg and tested its validity for spectral line formation in late - type stars .",
    "they predicted that nlte effects for solar type and metal - poor dwarfs are even smaller than those found in previous studies .",
    "however , nlte corrections can reach up to 0.4dex for giants .",
    "@xcite carried out a nlte analysis of near - infrared @xmath4-band lines for red supergiants.their results show that nlte corrections are substantial in the atmospheres of red supergiants , and vary smoothly between @xmath10.4dex and @xmath10.1dex as a function of the effective temperature .    the apogee survey ,",
    "part of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ) @xcite , has observed @xmath3150,000 predominantly red giants stars covering the full range of galactic bulge , bar , disk and halo @xcite since 2011 , and apogee-2 , an on - going extension of the project in sdss - iv will significantly enlarge this data base .",
    "apogee infrared _",
    "h_-band spectra have already been publicly released as part of the sdss data release 10 ( dr10 ) @xcite and data release 12 ( dr12 ) @xcite .",
    "these observations provide a promising way to trace and to explore the formation history of the milky way .    the apogee stellar parameters and chemical abundances pipeline ( aspcap ) @xcite is designed to derive the stellar parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity ) , and chemical abundances of 15 different elements .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , nlte effects may have an impact on the apogee derived stellar parameters and chemical abundances due to low densities present in the atmospheres of giants .",
    "thus , as an extension of our previous work , which is confined to _",
    "h_-band si lines , this paper focuses on nlte line formation of -band transitions for the 13 sample stars from .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to validate the applied mg atomic model , and to investigate the influence of departures from lte .",
    "this will help us to improve the accuracy of stellar parameters determined by the apogee pipeline and help to explore the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy based on large samples of apogee _",
    "h_-band spectra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section[method ] , we introduce the mg model atom and the nlte calculations . the data and the determination of stellar parameters for our sample stars are briefly described in section[sample_access ] .",
    "section[nlte ] derives the mg abundances from both _ h_-band and optical lines for our sample stars under lte and nlte analyses , respectively , and compares derived mg abundances from the two bands , discussing the implications . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "we utilized the updated model atom for mg from @xcite , which was based on the model produced by @xcite and @xcite .",

    ", we briefly introduce the atomic data . for electron impact excitation",
    ", the collisional rates were taken from @xcite when available , while from @xcite for the rest of the transitions .",
    "ionization cross - sections were computed from the formula by @xcite . for hydrogen - impact excitation and charge transfer ,",
    "the rate coefficients of the transitions between the seven lowest levels of mg and the ionic state ( mg @xmath5 h and mg@xmath6 @xmath5 h@xmath7 ) were adopted from @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .      in this study , we adopted the widely - used grid of marcs atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "these lte models are divided in two groups : models with 3.0 @xmath8 log @xmath9 were computed with a plane - parallel geometry , while those with relatively low surface gravities ( -1.0 @xmath8 log @xmath0 @xmath8 3.5 ) were calculated in spherical geometry . as in , according to the suggestions by @xcite and @xcite , spherical models were adopted for stars with log @xmath0 @xmath10 3.5 and plane - parallel model atmospheres for the rest .",
    "the final models were derived by interpolating with a fortran routine coded by thomas masseron .",
    "marcs model atmospheres @xcite adopt a solar chemical composition from @xcite .",
    "an @xmath2-enhancement is considered , and the mixing - length parameter is set to @xmath11=1.5 .",
    "as in , we adopted a revised version of the detail code @xcite to solve the coupled statistical equilibrium and the radiative transfer equations .",
    "this statistical equilibrium code is based on the accelerated lambda iteration algorithm described by @xcite , which has been widely applied in previous studies , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , etc .",
    "we calculated the departure coefficients using detail , and then input these coefficients to siu @xcite to calculate the synthetic nlte line profiles .",
    "we selected 13 stars with both ir _ h_-band and optical high - resolution and high s / n spectra available as sample stars .",
    "the _ h_-band spectra are mainly from apogee dr12 except those for the sun and , which will be described below .",
    "these apogee data were acquired with the nmsu ( new mexico state university ) 1 m telescope coupled to the apogee instrument : a bundle of ten fibers connects the apogee spectrograph and the nmsu 1 m telescope . in each observation ,",
    "one fiber is assigned to the science target while the rest are used as sky fibers .",

    "a high quality ir spectrum of was obtained from the noao data archives ( see @xcite for more observational information ) .",
    "the resolving power is around 300,000 and 100,000 , respectively , for the sun and .",
    "the high - resolution optical spectra of the 13 sample stars are from several different telescopes , and their characteristics have been described in detail in .",
    "we determined the stellar parameters @xmath13 , log @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath14 using a spectroscopic approach from the analysis of fe i and fe ii lines .",
    "the final parameters satisfy the fe i excitation equilibrium ( @xmath13 ) , the ionization equilibrium between fe i and fe ii ( log @xmath0 ) , and [ fe / h ] does not depend on equivalent width ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "nlte effects on lines have been considered as in @xcite .",
    "we estimated the typical uncertainties of @xmath13 , log @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath15 as @xmath1680k , @xmath160.1dex , @xmath160.08dex , and 0.2kms@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the determination of the stellar parameters and the comparison with previous work have been discussed in .",
    "magnesium abundances were derived from eight _ h_-band lines , and the characteristics of these transitions are listed in table[tbl-1 ] .",
    "the damping constants , log @xmath18 , are adopted from @xcite , which were calculated according to the _ abo _ theory @xcite .",
    "the rest of the line data were adopted from the nist atomic spectra database .",
    "the values of oscillator strengths , log @xmath19 , were rescaled with respect to the solar nlte results ( adopting log @xmath20(mg ) @xmath21 7.53dex measured from meteorites according to @xcite as the absolute solar mg abundance ) . among these eight lines , two transitions at 15748.886 and 15748.988 , three transitions at 15765.645 , 15765.747 , and 15765.842 , and transitions at 15886.183 and 15886.261are severally blended , and they can not be resolved at the resolution that the apogee instrument provides .",
    "however , it is worthwhile noting that each of the three blended lines is due to transitions between the same lower ( or higher ) energy level and fine structure splitting of the higher ( or lower ) level , we therefore fit all lines in a blended feature together via spectrum synthesis in a small wavelength interval . as a result , only four values for the mg abundances from the eight lines are actually derived for each star from the infrared spectra .",

    "the mean mg abundance differences between the _ h_-band and optical lines are within 0.05dex for all our sample stars when nlte effects are included , which suggests that our mg atomic model can be applied to study the formation of _ h_-band lines .",

    "the nlte correction is as large as @xmath570.14dex for the strong line in our sample stars , and for the extreme case in apogee it reaches up to @xmath570.22dex .",
