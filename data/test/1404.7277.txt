    "electronic wave functions in a disordered lattice exhibit an exponentially localized envelope in space  a phenomenon , commonly known as the anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "the problem has kept itself alive and kicking over all these years in condensed matter physics , and has given quantum transport properties of disordered systems intriguing twists and turns .",
    "the recent development of fabrication and lithographic techniques has taken the phenomenon of anderson localization beyond the electronic systems , substantiated by remarkable experiments incorporating localization of light  @xcite , ultrasound in three dimensional elastic networks  @xcite , or even plasmonic  @xcite and polaritonic  @xcite lattices .",
    "direct observation of the localization of matter waves  @xcite in recent times has made the decades old phenomenon even more exciting .",
    "the key point in anderson localization is the dimensionality . within the tight binding approximation ,",
    "the electronic wave functions are localized for dimensions @xmath0 ( the band center in the off diagonal disorder case is an exception ) . for @xmath1 with strong disorder , the wave function decays exponentially  @xcite .",
    "extensive analyses of the localization length  @xcite , density of states  @xcite , and multi - fractality of the single particles states  @xcite have consolidated the fundamental ideas of disorder induced localization .",
    "intricacies of the single parameter scaling hypothesis  its validity  @xcite , variance  @xcite , or even violation  @xcite in low dimensional systems provided the finer details of the localization phenomenon that have subsequently been supported by experimental measurements of conductance distribution in quasi - one dimensional gold wires  @xcite",
    ".    however , in low dimensions , or more specifically , in one dimensional disordered lattices even a complete delocalization of electronic states can be seen .",
    "this path breaking result was initially put forward by dunlap et al .",
    "@xcite in connection with a sudden enhancement of conductance of a class of polyanilenes on protonation . known as the _ random dimer model _ ( rdm )",
    "the phenomenon is attributed to certain special kinds of positional correlation in the potential profiles .",
    "the investigation of delocalization of eigenstates in correlated disordered models was taken up further over the years and interesting results such as the relation of localization length with the density of states  @xcite were put forward .",
    "the work extended to quasi - one dimensional systems as well for which the landauer resistance and its relation to the localization length was examined in details  @xcite for a two - leg ladder model , an extensive extension of which was later done by sedrakyan et al .",
    "@xcite . controlled",
    "disorder induced localization and delocalization of eigenfunctions took a considerable volume in contemporary literature , exploring solid non - trivial results involving electron or phonon eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "extended eigenfunctions in all such works mostly appear at special discrete set of energy eigenvalues .    eventually , the possibility of a controlled engineering of spectral continuum populated by extended single particle states and even a metal - insulator transition in one , or quasi - one dimensional discrete systems have also been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "but , on the whole , the general exponentially localized character of the eigenfunctions prevails , and the possibility of having a mixed spectrum of localized and extended states in a disordered system ( under some special positional correlations ) is now well established .",
    "can one generate , going beyond the rdm , a full band of only extended eigenfunctions in a disordered system with @xmath0 ?",
    "if yes , what would be the minimal models capable of showing such unusual spectra ?",
    "this is the question that we address ourselves in the present communication .",
    "we put forward examples of a class of essentially one dimensional disordered and quasiperiodic lattices where a _ complete delocalization _ of electronic states can be engineered , and _ absolutely continuous _ bands can be formed in the energy spectrum .",
    "this is shown to be possible when an infinite disordered or quasiperiodic array of two kinds of ` bonds ' is side coupled to a single or a cluster of quantum dots ( qd ) from one side at a special set of vertices .",
    "minimal requirements are discussed in details . in some of the examples cited here ,",
    "the attachment of the dots form local loops which can be pierced by a constant magnetic field , breaking the time reversal symmetry of electron - hopping only locally , along the edges of such closed loops .",
    "the engineering of bands of extended states is shown to be the result of a definite numerical correlation in the values of the electron hopping amplitude along the chain ( backbone ) and the coupling of the linear backbone with the side coupled dots , the strength of the magnetic field or both .",
    "it should be mentioned that an early report of a rdm - kind of correlation leading to extended eigenfunctions in a fibonacci superlattice was put forward by kumar and ananthakrishna  @xcite .",
    "the insight into the phenomenon was immediately provided by xie and das sarma  @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that , certain specific _ numerical relationship _ among a subset of parameters of the hamiltonian is capable of producing , absolutely continuous _ bands _ of extended eigenfunctions is uncommon , and to the best of our knowledge , has not been addressed until very recently  @xcite .",
    "we consider two bonds @xmath2 and @xmath3 arranged along a line forming an infinite linear chain .",
    "the sequence of the bonds may be random or quasiperiodic  @xcite , offering either a pure point spectrum or a singular continuous one .",
    "the bonds connect identical atomic sites , an infinite subset of which is coupled to similar atoms ( mimicing single level quantum dots ( qd ) ) from one side giving the system a quasi one dimensional flavor .",
    "the disorder ( or , quasiperiodic order ) thus has a topological character .",
    "in addition to the basic interest of going beyond the rdm , two other facts motivate us in undertaking such a work .",
    "first , the fano - anderson effect  @xcite caused by the insertion of a bound state into a continuum is an exciting field , and has been investigated recently in nanoscale systems  @xcite . in this context , our study provides examples where one can observe at least one effect of inserting multiple bound states , in fact , an infinity of them in a _ singular continuum _ , or a pure point spectrum .",
    "second , the present advanced stage of growth techniques has motivated in depth studies of quasiperiodic nanoparticle arrays in the context of ferromagnetic dipolar modes  @xcite or plasmon modes  @xcite .",
    "also , the use of a scanning tunnel microscope ( stm ) tip to fabricate structures atom by atom , viz . , xe on ni substrates  @xcite , or nanometer size gold particles on metals  @xcite , or , putting individual atoms of si substrate  @xcite has stimulated a lot of work in this field  @xcite .",
    "our results can motivate future experiments in this direction .    in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe the lattice models . in section  [ method ] , within subsections  [ method]a and [ method]b the local , non - local and",
    "the mixed cases introduced in section  [ model ] are discussed , with explicit remarks on the density of states profiles in each case .",
    "subsection  [ method]c specially deals with the special case of a fibonacci quasiperiodic chain , using a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) scheme .",
    "section  [ transmission ] describes the two terminal transmission coefficient , while section  [ univer ] provides a critical discussion on the evolution of the parameter space under the rsrg scheme and its relation with the extendedness of the wave function . in section  [ othergeometries ]",
    "we briefly point out a triplet of other geometries which are less restrictive compared to the ones discussed here , and in section  [ conclu ] we draw our conclusion .",
    "we refer the reader to fig .  [ cells ]     ( double line ) and @xmath3 ( red single line ) , such that a @xmath3-bond is always flanked by two @xmath2-bonds on either side .",
    "the atomic sites on the backbone are marked as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as described in the picture .",
    "the hooping integrals are appropriately described by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "( a ) a qd ( @xmath9 ) is locally connected to the @xmath4-site . this @xmath9-@xmath4 cluster is  renormalized \" into an effective site ( yellow circle surrounded by red dotted lines ) .",
    "( b)a qd ( @xmath9 ) is non - locally coupled to the @xmath5-@xmath6 pair .",
    "the @xmath9-@xmath5-@xmath6 cluster is then renormalized into the immediate lower geometry , pointed by the arrow .",
    "( c)the qds @xmath10 and @xmath11 exhibit a mixed connection to @xmath5-@xmath6 pair .",
    "the block @xmath5-@xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath6 is renormalized to the diatomic molecule shown by the arrowhead . in every case , the linear chain ( disordered or quasiperiodic ) is formed by arranging the cluster linked by the bent cyan double arrowheads in the desired order.,width=321 ]    where the basic structural units are displayed .",
    "the backbone in each case is an infinite array of a single ( red ) bond @xmath3 and a double bond @xmath2 .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to a geometry where the single ` @xmath3 ' bonds do not come pairwise .",
    "thus we have a kind of ` anti - rdm ' here .",
    "this is not always needed though , as will be discussed in the concluding section .",
    "three cases are separately discussed .",
    "the simplest one is that of a local connection ( lc ) , where a single qd ( marked as @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ cells](a ) is tunnel - coupled to a site @xmath4 flanked by two @xmath2-bonds .",
    "the second case discusses a non - local connection ( nlc ) , where a qd ( @xmath9 ) is tunnel - coupled to both the sites residing at the extremities ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ cells](b ) ) of a @xmath3-bond .",
    "the final geometry describes a mixed connection ( mc ) , where two inter - coupled qds @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected to the extremities of a @xmath3-bond ( i.e. to @xmath5 and @xmath6 sites ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ cells](c ) . in the two latter cases a uniform magnetic field",
    "is applied in a direction perpendicular to the plane of every closed loop .",
    "the system in each case is described by a tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "we show that , for a particular algebraic relationship between the nearest neighbor hopping integrals @xmath12 along the backbone and the backbone - qd coupling @xmath13 , the infinite topologically disordered or quasiperiodic chain of scatterers yields absolutely continuous energy bands in the spectrum . in the case of lc ( fig .",
    "[ cells](a ) ) there will be two continuous subbands . in the nlc and mc cases ( fig .",
    "[ cells](b ) and ( c ) ) a single absolutely continuous band spans the entire energy spectrum when , in addition to the algebraic relationship between the hopping integrals @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the magnetic flux @xmath14 threading each elementary plaquette assumes a particular value . these two cases ( nlc and mc ) therefore represent situations where the spectral character can be grossly changed from pure point or singular continuous to absolutely continuous by tuning an external magnetic field .",
    "this may be useful from the standpoint of device technology .",
    "spinless , non - interacting electrons on the chain comprising the building blocks depicted in fig .  [ cells ] are described by the hamiltonian , @xmath15   \\label{hamilton}\\ ] ] where , @xmath16 is the constant on - site potential , at every site including the qd ( marked @xmath9 ) .",
    "we have colored the atomic sites differently just to distinguish between their nearest neighbor bond configurations .",
    "these are marked as @xmath4 ( yellow circle ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( blue circles ) respectively .",
    "the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath17 ( double bond ) along the backbone on either side of an @xmath4-site , while it is @xmath8 ( denoted by red line segment ) between a @xmath5-@xmath6 pair . in the lc case ( fig .  [ cells](a ) ) @xmath18 between the qd and the @xmath4-site . in the nlc and the mc situations ( fig .",
    "[ cells](b ) and ( c ) ) the presence of the magnetic flux breaks the time reversal symmetry along the edges of the loops .",
    "this is taken care of by incorporating the appropriate peierls phase factor in the hopping integrals , viz .",
    ", @xmath19 where , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the perimeter of the plaquette and @xmath22 is the length of the bond connecting the @xmath23-th and the @xmath24-th sites of the loop .",
    "@xmath25 is the flux quantum .",
    "let us consider symmetric geometries only .",
    "this means that , in the nlc case , we assume that the qd is placed symmetrically above the @xmath5-@xmath6 cluster . in the mc case similarly , the @xmath5-@xmath10 , @xmath10-@xmath11 and the @xmath11-@xmath6 distances are equal .",
    "this just simplifies the mathematical expressions without sacrificing any physics that we are going to establish .",

    "the amplitude of the wave function at any remote site on such a chain is conveniently obtained by the transfer matrix technique .",
    "using the difference equation the amplitudes of the wave function at the neighboring sites along the effective one dimensional chain can be related using the @xmath45 transfer matrices , @xmath46 the hopping integrals @xmath47 will carry the appropriate phase factors when written for the nlc and mc cases .",
    "it is obvious that there are three kinds of transfer matrices , viz . ,",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and which will differ in their matrix elements , depending on the respective on - site potentials and the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals . from the arrangement of the @xmath5-@xmath6 clusters and the isolated sites in the original chain",

    "it should be appreciated that our purpose has been only to demonstrate the appearance of absolutely continuous part(s ) in the energy spectrum .",
    "the ldos coming from any one kind of sites is enough for this purpose .",
    "the contribution to the full density of states coming from the side - coupled qd sites generally consists of delta like localized peaks some of which reside outside the continuum  @xcite .",
    "these are of no concern in the present discussion , as the central motivation has always been to prove the generation of a band of extended states only as a result of some algebraic correlation between the numerical values of the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the _ extended _ character of the eigenstates populating such continuous portions of the energy spectrum will subsequently be discussed in next sections .",
    "to substantiate the ldos profiles we also calculate the two terminal transport in the systems considered .",
    "the procedure is standard .",
    "the system is clamped between two perfectly periodic , semi - infinite leads on either side ( fig .  [ transport ] ) .        the sample trapped in between the leads",
    "is then decimated to a dimer by judiciously using the rsrg recurrence relations .",
    "finally , the transmission coefficient is obtained by the well known formula  @xcite , @xmath117 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\text{and}\\quad \\mathcal{b}=[(p_{11}+p_{22})\\sin ka]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath118 refer to the dimer - matrix elements , written appropriately in terms of the on - site potentials of the final renormalized _ left _",
    "( l ) and _ right _ ( r ) atoms @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively , and the renormalized hopping between them  @xcite .",
    "@xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 being the on - site potential and the hopping integral in the leads , and @xmath124 is the lattice constant in the leads which taken equal to unity throughout the calculation .    in fig .",
    "[ trans ] we plot the transmission coefficient as a function of the energy of the electron in the three cases discussed so far .     as a function of the energy @xmath53 of the electron for both the resonance and the off - resonance conditions .",
    "( a ) represents the lc case , ( b ) represents the nlc case and ( c ) is for the mc case .",
    "the numerical values of the potentials and the hopping integrals are the same as in the ldos figures.,width=264 ]    in each panel , again the resonance and off - resonance cases are plotted together for comparison . in the top panel , for the local coupling ,",
    "when we set @xmath113 , the transmission coefficient attains very high values , achieving the limit unity in most cases for the entire regions of the continuous subbands .",
    "there is a clean gap between the two zones of high transmittivity .",
    "it is because one has gaps in the energy spectrum in this region , and any _ gap states _ arising out of the side coupled dots in this part must have a localized character .",
    "the perfect transmission under the resonance condition in the lc case brings out a variation over the recent studies of farchioni et al .",
    "@xcite , where it was rightly shown that , side - coupled dots in general suppress the transmission across a linear tight binding chain .    in the central and the bottom panels",
    ", the energy spectrum exhibits a single continuous band spanning the entire energy range . to be consistent with the ldos figures we have preset @xmath79 .",
    "the resonance , or a deviation from resonance is now controlled only by controlling the external magnetic field only .",
    "when the flux is detuned from its resonance value , the spectrum represents a fragmented character typical of quasiperiodic lattices , while precisely at @xmath80 the transmission coefficient turns out to be unity for the entire range of the continuum confirming the extended character of the eigenstates .",
    "in this section we would like to draw the attention of the reader to an interesting flow pattern followed by the on - site potentials and the hopping integrals when the elemental building blocks are arranged in a quasiperiodic fibonacci chain , as discussed below .",
    "( red ) , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( green ) , and the two nearest neighbor hopping integrals are @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively.,width=321 ]    first , it should be noted that , since the transfer matrices @xmath48 and @xmath58 corresponding to the the structural units depicted in fig .",
    "[ cells](a)-(c ) commute independent of energy @xmath53 under the appropriate _ resonance _ condition , the energy spectrum in this case should be the same for any uncorrelated disordered or quasiperiodic chains .",
    "as far as the quasiperiodic chains are concerned , though we have discussed the results specifically in terms of the golden mean fibonacci sequence , the idea and subsequent results hold true for any generalized fibonacci chain grown following the rule @xmath125 and @xmath83 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 representing the two bonds and @xmath126 .",
    "second important issue is the confirmation of the extended character of the eigenfunctions populating the continuous part of the ldos spectrum in all the cases .",
    "at least , for the deterministic fibonacci chain ( or it s generalizations ) an interesting answer to this question can be obtained by looking at how the on - site potentials and hopping integrals flow under successive rsrg iterations .",
    "let s try to understand .    in the local coupling case for example , with reference to the eq .",
    ", it is found that , as soon as we set @xmath127 the parameter space follows the pattern @xmath128 and @xmath129 at every @xmath85-th stage of renormalization , whenever we select an eigenvalue @xmath53 arbitrarily from within the two continuous subbands in the ldos spectrum .",
    "this observation is substantiated by extensive numerical search throughout the observed continua scanned in arbitrarily small energy intervals . that such a pattern should correspond to extended bloch - like eigenfunctions",
    "can be justified by considering fig .",
    "[ rgflow ] where a perfectly periodic lattice of identical on - site potential @xmath16 and a constant nearest neighbor hopping @xmath130 is artificially converted into a golden mean fibonacci chain . on this",
    "_ artificial _ fibonacci chain @xmath131 , and different from @xmath132 . at the same time , @xmath133 , the latter being equal to @xmath130 . the _ flow pattern",
    "_ that we have been talking about therefore sets in at the very beginning .    the artificial fibonacci chain in fig .  [ rgflow ]",
    "can now be renormalized using the recursion relations eq .  , and",
    "the density of states may be obtained from the appropriate green s function .",
    "as the parent lattice now is an ordered one , the typical one dimensional density of states is reproduced with the edges characterized by the van hove singularity .",
    "the spectrum is absolutely continuous , and all the wave functions are bloch functions .",
    "interestingly , with the initial set of values as given above , the on site potentials and the hopping integrals for the scaled version of the _ artificial _ fibonacci lattice ( fig .  [ rgflow ] ) get locked into the flow pattern @xmath134 and @xmath135 at every @xmath85-th stage of renormalization , and for all energy eigenvalues within the range @xmath136 $ ] .    in our actual case of fibonacci arrangement of the clusters in fig .",
    "[ cells](a ) as soon as such a flow pattern is set in for a special value of @xmath13 , it becomes impossible to judge whether the parent lattice was an ordered , perfectly periodic one , or a truly quasiperiodic fibonacci chain .",
    "thus the extendedness of the wave functions is firmly established whenever such an rsrg flow is observed .",
    "same flow pattern is also observed in the cases of fig .",
    "[ cells](b ) and ( c ) . in these cases , if we set beforehand @xmath79 , then the _ desired _ flow of the parameters can be achieved by tuning the external flux to @xmath80 .",
    "this refers to the interesting case of a _ flux driven crossover _ in the fundamental character of the wave functions in a non - locally coupled case or in the mixed case . in addition , for both the nlc case and the mc case , the ldos at the @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath4 sites turn out to be exactly same whenever the resonance condition is satisfied .",
    "this is remarkable .",
    "the nlc and mc lattices are topologically different .",
    "an equality of the ldos for @xmath79 and @xmath80 implies that for both these cases the parameters @xmath137 , initially represented by two different _ points _ ( as their initial values are different ) in the five dimensional parameter space , are driven to the same _ fixed point _ following two different trajectories .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the result is independent of the order of arrangement of the triangles or the square boxes . thus , for the same resonance condition an indefinite number of geometrically different systems , beginning their ` journey ' at different locations in the five dimensional parameter space finally flow , following different trajectories , to the same fixed point , and thus come under the common umbrella .",
    "we are tempted to conceptualize a kind of _ universality class _ from this point of view .",
    "it is to be noted however , that the comment is based on the observed ldos at the sites on the backbone only .",
    "the average density of states can be different though .",
    "before we end , it should be mentioned that , the central idea presented in the present work is not restricted to only the geometries discussed here . for example , one can have an array of triangular or square plaquettes without any isolated @xmath4-site , where the plaquettes can ` touch ' each other giving rise to an additional site named @xmath138 and having a coordination number four .",
    "we refer to fig .",
    "[ ringlattice ] for a display of a disordered arrangement of such building blocks .",
    "the analysis proceeds in the same way and the one comes across a varied set of geometries for which the disorder - induced localization ( or , a quasiperiodicity driven power law localization ) can be suppressed and a full band ( or subbands ) of extended eigenfunctions can be generated .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a class of topologically disordered array of building blocks described within a tight binding formalism , where delocalization of electronic eigenfunctions occur over either two subbands or over the entire range of allowed energies whenever the lattice parameters are inter - related through certain algebraic relation .",
    "we can have absolutely continuous spectrum even for such disordered or quasiperiodic arrangement of the unit cells in such cases .",
    "even an external magnetic field can be used to delocalize the electronic states over a continuous band of energy eigenvalues in certain cases .",
    "this aspect leads to the possibility of a flux driven state transition in such low dimensional systems ."
