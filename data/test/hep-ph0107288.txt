    "growing body of experimental information on fixed - target nucleus - nucleus collisions from ags and cern - sps accelerators provides a reliable basis for the systematic investigation of strongly interacting hadronic matter under extreme conditions .",

    "@xmath0 mesons , particles consisting mainly of @xmath4 pairs , are of a special interest .",
    "since the interaction of @xmath5 mesons with non - strange hadronic matter is suppressed according to ozi rule , @xmath5 mesons are expected to decouple easily from the hadronic fireball .",
    "several calculations have been done for @xmath0 meson properties in dense hadronic environment ( mainly at higher baryon densities ) @xcite .",
    "it has been found that modifications of the @xmath0 width and mass are sensitive to the strangeness content of the surrounding medium .",
    "recently , new experimental data from cern - sps on @xmath0 meson production in central pb+pb collisions at 158gev / a beam energy became available .",
    "advantage of the rich experimental program at cern is that it allows to study the @xmath0 production via different @xmath0 decay channels .",
    "results of na49 collaboration  @xcite are based on the @xmath0 meson identification via its hadronic decay @xmath6 , while na50 collaboration has recently reported @xcite about preliminary analysis of @xmath5 mesons identified via the dileptonic decay channel @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show , that the @xmath5 meson production spectra reconstructed via @xmath2 and @xmath1 decay channels can be significantly different up to the level of present experimental observations .",
    "after introductory considerations in section  ii we derive in section  iii expressions for momentum distributions of @xmath0 mesons detected via @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels .",
    "we take into account rescattering of decay kaons and in - medium modification of @xmath0 meson properties discussed in section  iv .",
    "numerical results are presented in sections  v and vi and conclusions are drawn in section  vii .",
    "for our estimates of the observed @xmath5 meson spectra we assume a simple two - stage picture of central heavy ion collisions , which is close to those considered within cascade - transport @xcite , hydrodynamical @xcite and thermodynamical approaches @xcite .",

    "mesons stream freely out from the fireball .",
    "pions and kaons , on the other hand , may still participate in mutual secondary interactions up to the stage of total thermal freeze - out .",
    "therefore , if a @xmath0 meson decays inside a fireball via hadronic channel we have to take into account possible interaction of its decay products with surrounding hadronic environment .    as a result of secondary interactions ,",
    "the reconstructed invariant mass of a given pair of @xmath0 daughter kaons falls out from the original @xmath0 meson peak into the region identified as a combinatorical background .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 mesons decaying in medium , can be partially unrecognized in experimental analysis of @xmath2 pairs .",
    "together with negligible final state interaction of secondary dimuons originating from @xmath18 decays this behaviour results in the relative suppression of @xmath0 meson yield observed via hadronic @xmath8 channel .",

    "possible increase of a @xmath0 meson width in medium will enlarge the probability of @xmath5 decay inside a fireball enhancing thus consequences of mechanism studied in ref .",
    "alternatively , we consider a possibility that the kaon decay channel of a @xmath0 meson becomes kinematically quenched in the medium .",
    "additionally we argue that substantial relative difference in properties of @xmath19 and @xmath20 meson in hadronic environment caused by the isospin asymmetry and/or by the large baryonic admixture , would also prevent the reconstruction of @xmath0 mesons decaying into kaon pairs inside the medium .",

    "[ fig : med ] shown by thick solid line ( a ) calculated for parameter set ( @xmath175 ) we observe that kinematical quenching of @xmath229 channel by increasing kaon mass decreases ratio @xmath206 very slightly for both values of @xmath55 .",
    "this happens because @xmath0 meson width becomes very small in this case and therefore probability of @xmath5 meson decay inside the expanding fireball and consequently also probability for rescattering of daughter kaons are small .",
    "compare lines ( c ) , calculated for parameter set ( @xmath175 ) , with a corresponding line in fig .  [ fig : nomedr15 ] .",
    "lines ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : med ] ( left side ) show that @xmath226 becomes larger than one for increasing kaon mass .",
    "since increase of @xmath230 by 10%20% does not change considerably the effective @xmath12 slope of @xmath231 distribution , we do not need to readjust the flow velocity parameter .",
    "this increase of @xmath230 leads at the end to a small decrease of @xmath232 .",
    "let us now consider the case when the @xmath0 meson width increases strongly in hadronic medium due to the increase of @xmath116 .",
    "we simulate this effect by decrease of the kaon mass in medium , which can result e.g. from rescattering of kaons on pions through @xmath233 and heavier kaonic resonances @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to rather conservative modification of kaon masses @xmath234  mev@xmath235 which corresponds to the @xmath0 width @xmath236  mev . in this case @xmath237 and at small @xmath238 region @xmath230 can be suppressed up to 4060% .",
    "thus , for a given freeze - out temperature @xmath145 and total width @xmath144 we readjust flow velocity @xmath239 to reproduce the slope of the @xmath12 distribution measured in di - muon channel by na50 @xcite .",
    "for our three sets of parameters ( @xmath240 ) we obtain new flow velocities : ( @xmath175 ) @xmath241 , ( @xmath177 ) @xmath242 , ( @xmath179 ) @xmath243 .",

    "[ fig : med ] shows our results obtained for @xmath225  mev .",
    "corresponding partial width is @xmath244  mev , and the total width is @xmath245  mev .",

    "[ fig : med ] ( right side , lines c ) .",
    "we find @xmath248 for @xmath228 and @xmath249 for @xmath143 .",
    "however , since the ratio @xmath250 also shown in fig .  [ fig : med ] ( lines b ) is also suppressed the resulting ratio @xmath206 remains on the level @xmath251 for small @xmath238 , provided we put @xmath143 and @xmath252 for @xmath228 .",
    "taking even larger values of the total decay width in the most preferable case ( @xmath175 ) we obtain @xmath253 for @xmath254  mev , @xmath242 , and @xmath255 for @xmath256  mev , @xmath257 ( both for @xmath258 ) .",
    "it is instructive to investigate ratio ( [ eta ] ) as a function of the @xmath0 momentum . averaging over rapidity mixes momenta within a broad interval , e.g. , for @xmath259 momenta @xmath260  mev what partially washes out the final suppression effect . to illustrate this point we show ratio @xmath261 as a function of a @xmath0 momentum in fig .",

    "this is again a direct consequence of a rapid fireball expansion which brings @xmath263 in the integral ( [ ratrescat ] ) fast to its vacuum value . in the extreme case for @xmath264 and @xmath265",

    "width=188 ]    we compare the original rapidity distribution of @xmath0 mesons @xmath271 , with the distributions which can be reconstructed via kaonic @xmath269 , and muonic @xmath270 decay channels .",
    "calculations are done for the parameter set ( @xmath175 ) with @xmath272  mev , flow velocity @xmath241 and @xmath143 .",
    "distributions are normalized to give @xmath273 .",
    "we observe a considerable broadening of the rapidity distribution measured in the kaon channel .",
    "we have studied distributions of @xmath5 mesons in heavy - ion collisions at sps energies reconstructed via hadronic @xmath2 and dilepton @xmath274 decay channels .",
    "the analysis of @xmath5 meson mean free path allows to suppose that @xmath0 mesons decouple from the hadronic system at somewhat earlier stage before the common breakup of the hadronic fireball .",
    "therefore , kaon pairs originated from the @xmath0 decays inside a fireball can be rescattered or absorbed .",
    "such kaon pairs will not contribute to a @xmath0 meson reconstruction , whereas the leptonic probes can leave a fireball freely .",
    "we derive the expressions ( [ ratrescat ] ) and ( [ ratmu ] ) for the apparent momentum distribution of @xmath0 mesons in kaonic and muonic channels respectively .    within a simple model of spherically expanding fireball",
    "we investigate dependence of a relative suppression factor of the hadronic channel with respect to the dileptonic one on parameters of the system and on the @xmath0 meson in - medium properties . for a vacuum @xmath0-meson width @xmath275  mev the maximal suppression 0.60.8",
    "is obtained for the fireball size and expansion time @xmath276  fm .",
    "these values are in agreement with results of rqmd simulations @xcite .",
    "the crucial parameter is the fast expansion of a fireball with @xmath2770.5 corresponding to the @xmath0 freeze - out temperature range @xmath278170  mev .",
    "width of hadronic @xmath0 meson decay channels ( @xmath100 and @xmath279 ) can be modified in medium due to changes of the meson properties .",
    "we have found that increase of the @xmath280 channel width due to the broadening of @xmath102 meson and decrease of @xmath218 meson mass leads alone to a tiny increase of the suppression .",
    "other possibility is kinematical quenching of the kaon decay channel , which we simulate by simultaneous increase of @xmath19 and @xmath20 masses . since",
    "total width @xmath281 of @xmath5 meson in medium becomes small ( increase of the @xmath280 channel width is not strong enough ) @xmath0 mesons decay mainly outside the fireball , where vacuum properties of @xmath5 mesons are restored and rescattering of daughter kaons is negligible .",
    "together with relative amplification of the muon decay channel by 20% the resulting suppression factor found for a quenched kaon decay channel was @xmath252 .",
    "the increase of the @xmath0 meson width in medium provides , on the other hand , a mechanism for strong suppression ( @xmath249 ) of the kaonic detection channel due to the enhancement of @xmath5 decay probability inside a fireball increasing thus rescattering of daughter kaons .",
    "however , increase of the @xmath0 total width reduces simultaneously the branching ratio of @xmath282 decay and suppresses the spectrum of @xmath5 mesons reconstructed via @xmath1 decay channel .",
    "obtained suppression of the muonic decay channel at the level @xmath28360% requires readjustment of the flow velocity to be compatible with experimental slope of na50 . adjusted flow velocity @xmath2840.4 for @xmath285  mev and @xmath278170  mev ( compare to @xmath2770.5 obtained for a vacuum @xmath0 width ) gives final net relative suppression factor of kaon channel to muon channel @xmath251",
    "this value is close to experimental observations at cern sps @xcite .",
    "strong increase of @xmath5 meson in - medium width can take place if the kaon mass decreases in medium by 30  mev .",
    "the mechanism for such kaon mass modification can be similar to that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally we suppose that to improve understanding of experimental results on @xmath5 meson production in heavy ion collisions at cern sps @xcite further detailed investigations taking into account in - medium effects within transport or hydrodynamical models are necessary .",
