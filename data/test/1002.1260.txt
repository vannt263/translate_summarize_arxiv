    "it has been realised over the past decade that the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the centre of a galaxy bulge plays a major role in galaxy evolution .",
    "the process commonly considered is the negative feedback effect which may determine the final stellar mass of a galaxy so that it ends up with the locally observed universal bulge stellar mass over smbh mass ratio ( e.g. cattaneo et al .",
    "2009 , fabian 2009 ) , m@xmath2/m@xmath3 700 ( 500 in marconi & hunt 2003 , mclure & dunlop 2001 or ferrarese et al . 2006 , 700 in kormendy & gebhardt 2001 and 830 in mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "indeed the correlation that exists between the mass of the central smbh of local galaxies and their bulge luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , stellar mass or velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al . 2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , suggests the existence of a physical mechanism connecting the activity of a galaxy nucleus and the bulding of its host galaxy stellar bulge .",
    "the most massive galaxies exhibiting the largest over - abundance of @xmath4-elements with respect to the solar value , this means that they formed their stars the fastest ( thomas et al .",
    "2005 ) and indeed a downsizing of the typical star forming galaxy has been observed in deep surveys , i.e. the comoving star formation rate activity of the universe is dominated by more and more massive galaxies going back in lookback time .",
    "if negative feedback may provide a way to `` kill '' galaxies to reproduce the downsizing of galaxies , it does not necessarily explain why most stars in massive ellipticals formed rapidly .",
    "hence positive feedback must have been at play early on shortly after the formation of the proto - galaxy .",
    "major mergers have long been thought to be the best candidates to explain those rapid processes by first triggering a starburst then feeding the central smbh and activating the qso phase ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) , but this scenario has been subject to debate , in particular since it was found that agn activity in the nearby universe was not shown to correlate with galaxy pairs ( li et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "since the masses of smbh and of stars in galaxies are correlated , it is natural to consider the alternative possibility that both processes are related , with one possibly affecting the other .",
    "if radio jets are shown to be able to trigger star formation in galaxies , as suggested by early studies of distant galaxies but more or less abandoned since then , they may represent an interesting candidate process to understand the universal mass ratio since the most massive smbh will have the largest accretion rates , hence also most powerful radio jets , possibly triggering more efficiently star formation .",
    "because radio jets are difficult to identify , especially in the distant universe , they have not yet been considered as a major actor in the process of galaxy formation .",
    "however , they must have been ubiquitous in the past to explain the ubiquity of smbh in the center of local galaxies .",
    "together with the following pieces of evidence , this suggests that their role may have been underestimated until now : ( i ) the discovery of a jet - induced ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) , one of the strongest starbursts ever observed , in the system he0450@xmath02958 , ( ii ) the presence of massive extended emission line regions ( eelr ) surrounding quasars and mostly radio galaxies , ( iii ) evidence that radio jets were more abundant in the past , ( iv ) the presence of large concentrations of molecular gas with an offset with respect to their neighboring qso , possibly resulting from the impact of radio jets , ( v ) theoretical arguments suggesting that radio jets may trigger star formation efficiently .",
    "our aim here is not to firmly state that we are convinced that galaxy formation can not be understood without accounting for the role of radio jets , since existing data and models are too sparse to either infer or reject such statement .",
    "however , in the near future , new observatories such as alma , evla , e - elt or the jwst will provide crucial observations that should allow us to better address this issue , hence we wish here to bring back to the front this mechanism as a possible driver not only of star formation , but maybe even galaxy formation .",
    "evidence for jet - induced star formation has been found in various objects and environments , either far away from the host galaxy , such as in the lobe of radio jets ( e.g. van breugel et al .",
    "1985 ) , or inside the host galaxy , resulting in the so - called radio - optical alignment ( e.g. mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 , rees 1989 ) .",
    "mccarthy et al . (",
    "1987 ) noticed that both the stellar continuum and size of the emission line region of 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath50.6 were highly elongated in parallel with their radio jets .",
    "this so - called radio  optical alignment was interpreted as evidence that the radio jets interact with the interstellar medium and stimulate large - scale star formation in the host galaxy ( see also rees 1989 , rejkuba et al . 2002 , oosterloo & morganti 2005 ) .",
    "other mechanisms than jet - induced star formation have been suggested in the literature to explain the radio - optical alignment effect such as the scattering of light from the central agn ( e.g. dey & spinrad 1996 ) or the nebular continuum emission from warm line - emitting regions ( dickson et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , many of these objects show clear evidence of star formation .",
    "this is , in particular , the case of 4c 41.17 ( @xmath1=3.8 ) , which rest - frame uv continuum emission is aligned with the radio axis of the galaxy , unpolarized and showing p cygni - like features similar to those seen in star - forming galaxies ( dey et al .",
    "the most dramatic events , with star formation rates as high as 1000 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , are associated with very luminous radio galaxies at redshifts up to z @xmath8 4 often located at the center of proto - clusters of galaxies ( dey et al .",
    "1997 , bicknell et al .",
    "2000 , zirm et al .",
    "2005 ) . even in the closest radio galaxy centaurus",
    "a , the reality of jet - induced star formation has been the center of a debate . early on , blanco et al . (",
    "1975 ) noticed the presence of extended gaseous filaments with bright knots exhibiting strong h@xmath4 and uv emission or loose chains of blue compact objects aligned with the radio jets of the central active nucleus .",
    "the origin of these optical filaments has been subject to a long debate regarding the main source of their ionization until the young and massive stars inhabiting these optical knots were individually resolved showing that jet - induced star formation must indeed have taken place in this system ( rejkuba et al .",
    "if there is indeed a mechanism through which radio jets may induce star formation in quasars or radio galaxies , then this mechanism may also be at play inside their scaled - down version , i.e. microquasars .",
    "the relativistic jets of the microquasar grs 1915@xmath9105 , which show apparent superluminal motion , are aligned with two iras sources themselves associated with radio knots .",
    "one of the radio source was resolved with the vla showing a non thermal extension pointing also in the direction of the microquasar on one side and the iras source on the other side ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : grs1915 ] ) .",
    "both iras sources appear to be h ii regions ionized by late o or early b stars ( rodriguez & mirabel 1998 ) .        inversely , radio jets are known to be efficient in producing a negative feedback on the environment of the massive radio galaxies located at the center of the so - called `` cooling flow '' clusters ( see fabian 2009 , cattaneo 2009 ) . there , even when its cooling time gets lower than 1 gyr , the intracluster medium ( icm ) temperature does not fall below a given threshold which implies that non gravitational heating is taking place .",
    "the presence of buoyant radio bubbles brings direct evidence that on these large scales , radio jets can prevent cooling from happening if they are long - lived . at the smaller scale of individual galaxies",
    ", there is no such strong direct evidence for negative feedback and the process must be different since radio jets are collimated , hence should escape galaxies without affecting the bulk of their ism .",
    "for this reason , a second mode has been considered , called the radiative or wind mode ( see discussion in fabian 2009 ) . yet",
    "observationally , active nuclei are often found associated with star formation and both effects may not be exclusive in the sense that positive feedback may occur first at early stages in galaxy evolution followed by the quenching of star formation at a later stage .    the discovery of a case of a ulirg in which the intense star formation activity appears to be triggered by the impact of a radio jet ( elbaz et al .",
    "2009 and sect .",
    "[ sec : he0450 ] ) suggests that , at least in some cases , positive feedback from radio jets can be a powerful mechanism .",
    "this is a scaled up version of the prototypical example for jet - induced star formation , minkowski s object , and in both cases , no evidence has been found for the presence of stars older than the starburst which suggests that the process may be responsible for the triggering of the formation of a whole galaxy .",
    "the fact that at @xmath1@xmath82 , the comoving space density of radio galaxies with powerful jets was 1000 times higher than at the present epoch ( willott et al . 2001 ) , suggests that the process taking place in these locally rare cases may have been an important actor in the process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "relic traces of this activity may be seen in the presence of the extended emission line regions ( eelrs ) surrounding qsos , and radio galaxies , with masses which may be as large as that of a massive galaxy , i.e. 10@xmath10 m@xmath6 ( fu & stockton 2008 ) .",
    "those gas reservoirs may represent the seeds for new galaxies if they are shocked by a radio jet as it may have happened in he0450@xmath02958 and such events may have been more common in the past . indeed , hydrodynamical simulations of radiative shock - cloud interactions indicate that for moderate gas cloud densities ( @xmath11 1 @xmath12 ) such as those observed in eelrs , cooling processes can be highly efficient and result in more than 50% of the initial cloud mass cooling to below 100 k , hence leading to star formation ( fragile et al .",
    "the mere existence of these eelrs itself is suggestive of the impact of radio jets on galaxies since their abundance ratios are similar to those observed in the host galaxies of their neighboring agn , which fu & stockton ( 2008 ) interpret as evidence that they were expelled out of the host galaxy by the radio jets .",
    "because they are collimated , radio jets may not affect very strongly the host galaxy of the active nucleus that produces them but they may produce an impact on the local environment .",
    "we present here two elements favoring this interpretation :    - the pair of ulirgs in the he0450@xmath02958 system , discussed in the next section , provide evidence for a major event in the formation process of a galaxy related to radio jets ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : he0450 ] ) .",

    "<S> we discuss evidence that quasars , and more generally radio jets , may have played an active role in the formation stage of galaxies by inducing star formation , i.e. through positive feedback . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism first proposed in the 70 s has been considered as anecdotic until now , contrary to the opposite effect that is generally put forward , the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies to explain the galaxy bimodality , downsizing and the universal black hole mass over bulge stellar mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this suggestion is based on the recent discovery of an ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , i.e. an extreme starburst , which appears to be triggered by a radio jet from the qso he0450@xmath02958 at @xmath1=0.2863 , together with the finding in several systems of an offset between molecular gas and quasars , which may be explained by the positive feedback effect of radio jets on their local environment . </S>"
