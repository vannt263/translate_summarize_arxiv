    "shocks contain information on the velocity and geometry of the merger .",

    "another is a hot region in front of the a665 core ( markevitch & vikhlinin 2001 , hereafter mv ) which shows no clear density jump perhaps because of an unfavorable viewing geometry .",

    "the telescope and detector response were modeled as described in mv .",
    "the acis background rate did not vary during the exposure , but was higher than expected by a factor of about 1.3 , most likely due to anomalous `` space weather '' .",
    "this required special background modeling . to do this ,",
    "we extracted a spectrum from the acis - i region outside an @xmath10 ( @xmath11 mpc ) circle centered on the cluster , which should be free of cluster emission . point sources were excluded .",

    "such a background anomaly in the acis - i chips is rare and not yet understood .",
    "we assumed that this component is distributed uniformly over the detector , and added it ( normalized by solid angle ) to the nominal background spectra .",
    "high - energy residuals in the overall cluster fit indicated that the normalization of the corrected background required an additional 10% increase ( perhaps indicating some spatial nonuniformity of the excess ) , which we applied to the spectra from all cluster regions .    to make a @xmath17 kev image for the gas density analysis",
    ", we compared the observed background rate far from the cluster to the nominal model background ( without the above additional component ) and derived a correction factor of 1.35 for this wide band , which was applied to the model background image .",

    "4_b _ ) is of the order of that in the cooling flow clusters at comparable radii .",
    "this suggests that the bullet is a remnant of a density peak ( cooling flow ) that once was at the center of the merging subcluster , perhaps around its brightest galaxy ( fig .",
    "the subcluster s less dense outer gas was probably shocked and ram pressure stripped to the radius where the pressures are balanced ( see fig .",

    "this interface will be studied in detail using a longer  observation planned for 2002 .",
    "the existence of a few extremely hot clusters such as e  have been used in the past to derive cosmological constraints under the assumption that the high temperature indicates high virial mass .",
    "however , the results presented here show that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in e  can easily overestimate the mass by a significant factor due to the ongoing merger and a temporary increase in temperature ( see , e.g. , simulations by ricker & sarazin 2001 and ritchie & thomas 2001 ) .",
    "it is thus difficult to draw any strong cosmological conclusions without a better estimate of the cluster mass .",
    "the unique shock and supersonic subcluster in e  enable several interesting measurements .",
    "since the gas density and temperature jumps at the shock are related , their accurate measurement may give the equation of state for the intracluster plasma .",
    "magnetic fields , a relativistic particle population with sufficient pressure , a significant lag between the electron and ion temperatures , and large nonthermal energy losses in a shock could all change the true or the apparent value of @xmath65 .    from the velocity of the bullet and the density of the ambient gas , we can derive the ram pressure on the bullet .",
    "the gas bullet appears to be pushed away from the subcluster s dark matter potential well just now , so the gravitational pull of the subcluster should equal the ram pressure .",
    "this may give an independent estimate of the subcluster s total mass ( markevitch et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the cluster also presents an interesting opportunity to constrain the collisional nature of dark matter ( e.g. , spergel & steinhardt 2000 ; furlanetto & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "there is a clear offset between the centroid of the bullet subcluster s galaxies and its gas .",
    "if one measures the location of the subcluster s dark matter density peak ( e.g. , from weak lensing or detailed modeling of the gas distribution ) , one may determine whether the dark matter is collisionless , as are the galaxies , or if it experiences an analog of ram pressure , as does the gas .",
    "the  observation of e  presents a prototypical example of a merger bow shock .",
    "the shock propagates in front of a cooler gas `` bullet '' , apparently a remnant of a dense central region of the merging subcluster whose outer gas was stripped by ram pressure .",
    "the subcluster mach number is 23 and its velocity is 30004000 .",
