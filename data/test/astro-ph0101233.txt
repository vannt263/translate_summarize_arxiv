    "the study of ` microquasars ' , or the phenomenon of relativistic jets from x - ray binary systems , is one of the most vigorously pursued fields in observational high - energy astrophysics in recent years .",
    "once mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 ) had shown that x - ray binary systems were capable of producing relativistic ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 ) outflows , whose primary signature was in the radio band , it was recognised that such ` jets ' may constitute an important aspect of the ` accretion ' process onto compact objects . in recent years observations",
    "have clearly demonstrated the presence of jets in most classes of x - ray binary , and furthermore have clearly indicated a strong coupling with the accretion ` state ' of the source , whether neutron star ( e.g. penninx et al . 1988 ) or black hole accretor ( e.g. fender et al .",
    "see e.g. hjellming & han ( 1995 ) , mirabel & rodriguez ( 1999 ) , and other papers by this author for reviews of radio emission and jets from x - ray binaries ( although note that new observations are coming thick and fast all the time ! ) .",
    "see e.g. lewin , van paradijs & van den heuvel ( 1995 ) for an excellent volume containing reviews of the models for the different ` states ' of accreting neutron stars and black holes ( admittedly from the era before the ubiquity and significance of jets was widely recognised ) .    in fig 1 and 2",
    "i summarise the current understanding of the empirical relation of radio emission to x - ray ` state ' of the neutron star ( ns ) and black hole candidate ( bhc ) systems respectively .",
    "in addition to the relations indicated in these figures , it seems that discrete , radio - emitting ejection events ( in which the radio spectrum rapidly becomes optically thin ) are associated with state transitions ( including outbursts of transients  fig 3 ) .",
    "while some areas of the coupling between accretion flow and jet are still empirically uncertain ( the atoll sources , the intermediate / very high state for bhcs ) , it seems that all xrbs except the high - field x - ray pulsars will , under the right conditions , produce a synchrotron - emitting jet .",
    "it is therefore an important question to address the significance of this jet , energetically and dynamically , for the process of accretion onto compact objects as a whole .",
    "one thing obvious from inspection of figs 1(a),(b ) is the apparent anti - correlation between the mass accretion rate , @xmath3 , traditionally estimated from x - ray studies alone , and the presence of a jet , in both ns and bhc systems ( see also belloni , migliari & fender 2000 and homan et al .",
    "2001 for further discussion ) .",
    "the energetics of jets from x - ray binaries in general , and bhcs in the low / hard state in particular , are discussed in detail in fender ( 2001a , b ) , in which it is concluded that the jets probably contain at least 20% of the liberated accretion energy , maybe much more .",
    "in this energy band ( rather arbitrarily defined here ) there are several detections of x - ray binary systems .",
    "both of the two major groups of neutron star systems which probably produce jets , z and atoll sources , have been detected in some cases to energies @xmath5 kev . in the case of the z sources",
    ", a picture now seems to be emerging whereby a hard tail , extending to @xmath6 kev , is present in varying degree , being strongest on the horizontal branch ( hb ) of the x - ray colour diagram ( cd ) and weakest ( or non - existent ) on the flaring branch ( fb ; see fig 1 for a schematic of a ` typical ' cd ) .",
    "asai et al .",
    "( 1994 ) first found evidence for a hard tail from gx 5 - 1 which decreased from the normal branch ( nb ) to the fb .",
    "more recently di salvo et al .",
    "( 2001 a , b ) have reported the detection of a hard x - ray tail from the z sources gx 17 + 2 and gx 349 + 2 ; again the data seem to be consistent with the hard x - ray tail being strongest in the hb / nb and weakest on the fb .",
    "iaria et al . (",
    "2001 ) also find evidence for a hard tail in the jet source cir x-1 , which may be an unusual z source .",
    "hard x - ray emission has also been reported from the archetypal z source sco x-1 , although its correspondence with position on the z is unclear ( damico et al .",
    "strickman & barret ( 2000 ) report that the hard x - ray emission in sco x-1 may be correlated with periods of radio flaring .",
    "comparison of this picture with fig 1 shows that observationally , the presence of the hard tail seems to be correlated with the presence of radio emission ( and therefore almost certainly jet production ) .",
    "note that in the received wisdom @xmath3 increases from hb@xmath7nb@xmath7fb , and so both jet and hard x - ray production are anticorrelated with @xmath3 .",
    "the atoll sources , weaker as a population than the z sources at radio wavelengths ( fender & hendry 2000 ) , also display hard x - ray states with emission detected up to and beyond 100 kev .",
    "for example , di salvo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report the detection to such high energies of the atoll source 4u 1728 - 34 , and barret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report hard x - ray tails from four other atoll - type x - ray binaries .",
    "it is clear that in ` low ' states of the atoll sources a hard x - ray power - law is present which seems to be the dominant component in the broadband spectral energy distribution .",
    "if , as we suspect , both by analogy with bhcs and recent observations , ( work in preparation ) , that radio emission in atoll sources is also associated with ` low ' x - ray states , specifically the island state ( is ) in the atoll cd , we again find , as with the z sources , that radio and hard x - ray emission are correlated with each other and anti - correlated with apparent @xmath3 .",
    "many bhc systems have been detected at energies above 30 kev ; in fact the x - ray power - law which dominates the high - energy radiation from bhcs in the low / hard spectral state generally extends to at least 100 kev .",
    "furthermore , although the high / soft state is dominated energetically by a ` soft ' disc component , there is increasing evidence that a steep power - law extends beyond this thermal component to at least several hundred kev ( grove et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; poutanen 1998 ) .",
    "fig 2 illustrates the x - ray spectral and timing properties of the main ` states ' schematically , and fig 5 shows some examples of ` real ' x - ray spectra .",
    "hard x - ray emission seems to be a general , although not exclusive , property of bhcs .",
    "the batse and osse instruments onboard the ( late ) cgro mission contributed an exceptional amount to our understanding of the relation of the hard x - ray emission from bhcs ( e.g. grove et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "brocksopp et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and corbel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that there is a strong correlation between hard x - rays ( as measued with batse ) and radio emission in the persistent bhcs cyg x-1 and gx 339 - 4 ( fig 6 ) .",
    "mccollough et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the jet source cyg x-3 ( which may be a bhc ) shows both correlated and anti - correlated radio  hard x - ray behaviour ( fig 7 ) ; this may correspond to different x - ray ` states ' and/or rapid state transitions in this source ( whose accretion properties remain shrouded by a dense wind ) .",
    "the bhc grs 1915 + 105 ( see right panel of fig 2 ) is probably the best - known ` microquasar ' and is a strong source of hard x - rays , being well - detected by batse over a six - year period .",
    "foster et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported hard x - ray states , or ` plateaux ' in this source .",
    "these plateaux seem to be periods of steady jet production , like luminous variants on the ` canonical ' low / hard x - ray state , and are generally followed by discrete , relativistic ejection events ( fender et al . 1999a ; dhawan et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the granat mission has also contributed immensely to our understanding of patterns of hard x - ray emission from x - ray binaries ( e.g. ballet et al .",
    "1994 ; churazov et al .",
    "many other examples of hard x - ray detections of bhcs exist in the literature , but it seems that the majority of detections are associated with the low / hard x - ray state and/or transient outbursts , both of which are associated with jet production ( figs 2 & 3 ) .",
    "grove et al .",
    "( 1998 ) clearly establish that while the hard ( photon index @xmath8 ) x - ray power laws observed in the low / hard state tend to break at about 100 kev , when the spectrum is dominated by a soft ( presumably disc ) component the steep ( photon index @xmath9 ) power - law tail observed does not show a break to at least several hundred kev . this weak , high energy tail in the soft state ( when the jet is apparently off - fig 2 ) probably requires a nonthermal population of comptonising electrons ( poutanen 1998 ) .",
    "above @xmath11kev the number of detections of x - ray binaries drops significantly .",
    "cyg x-1 , the classic bhc , was repeatedly detected at @xmath12 mev with comptel on cgro , and may even be stronger above 1 mev in the ` high / soft ' state ( fig 8 ; mcconnell et al .",
    "2001 a , b ) .",
    "the relativistic jet source gro j1655 - 40 and the low / hard state source gro j0422 + 32 are also both detected up to @xmath13 mev ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) . more dramatically , goldwurm et al .",
    "( 1992 ) reported the detection of a positron annihilation line from gro j0422 + 32 , although this may in fact be associated with lithium ( e.g. martin et al . 1994 ) .    at even higher energies ,",
    "paredes et al .",
    "( 2000 and references therein ; fig 9 ) report the discovery of radio jets from the x - ray binary ls 5039 , which is coincident with one of the unidentified egret sources .",
    "they suggest that the @xmath0-rays are produced by inverse compton upscattering of lower - energy photons by the nonthermal relativistic electron population producing the resolved radio emission .",
    "it is worth noting that lsi+61@xmath14 303 is also an x - ray - faint , radio - bright system which may be associated with an egret source ( harrison et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "there seems to be a qualitative empirical relation between the presence of hard ( rather arbitrarily defined as 30500 kev ) x - ray emission and radio emission in both ns and bhc x - ray binaries . since the evidence strongly points to the radio emission arising in a synchrotron - emitting jet , this implies an association between the presence of a hard x - ray emission and the production of an outflowing , nothermal , population of relativistic electrons .",
    "are these two things related causally , or are they simply both more or less independent manifestations of a particular accretion / outflow ` state ' ?",
    "since ( a ) the hard x - ray emission is generally taken to arise in ( inverse ) comptonisation of soft photons by energetic electrons ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; poutanen 1998 and references therein ) , ( b ) the synchrotron emission from the jet directly indicates a population of energetic electrons , it might seem reasonable to guess that the comptonising electrons are part of the jet flow . in fender et al .",
    "( 1999b ) it was suggested that the ` base ' of the jet is responsible for the comptonisation in the canonical low / hard x - ray state .",
    "however , the favoured models for the low / hard state invoke _ thermal _ comptonisation ( poutanen 1998 and references therein ) .    are the jets significant enough energetically to contribute in hard x - rays , or is the power - law distribution responsible for the synchrotron emission simply a small high - energy tail of a much more energetically significant thermal distribuion ?",
    "without accurately normalised estimates of both populations for one source , it is hard to make a comparison .",
    "however , fender ( 2000a , b ) argues that the jets from bhcs in the low / hard state are likely to be a significant power output channel for the accretion energy .",
    "if the synchrotron spectrum extends merely to the near - infrared band ( @xmath15 m ) and the jet has a radiative efficiency of @xmath16 then the jet is likely to contribute @xmath17% of the bolometric luminosity of the system in this state .",
    "it seems therefore that in the low / hard state at least there is enough power in the jet to justify consideration of its contribution to the hard x - ray/@xmath0-ray emission a source .",
    "aharonian & atoyan ( 1998 ) and atoyan & aharonian ( 1999 ) discuss the possibility of @xmath0-rays from the jets of gro j1655 - 40 , grs 1915 + 105 and ss 433 .",
    "in particular , atoyan & aharonian ( 1999 ) predict that inverse compton emission ( or maybe even direct synchrotron emission ) directly from the jets in grs 1915 + 105 could dominate the high - energy emission above an mev or so .",
    "more radically , markoff , falcke & fender ( 2000 ) suggest that in the low / hard x - ray state the broadband radio through x - ray spectrum is dominated by the jet ( with some contribution from thermal emission in the uv and soft x - ray band ) . in this model",
    "the x - ray power - law is dominated by optically thin synchrotron emission from the post - shock region near the base of the jet .",
    "to conclude , it seems that , while some famous and poorly - explained exceptions exist in the literature ( e.g. gro j1655 - 40 ; tavani et al .",
    "1996 ) , in general the presence of ` hard ' x - ray emission ( 30500 kev ) is correlated with the presence of radio emission in both ns and bhc x - ray binaries ( with the exception of high - field x - ray pulsars which do not seem to produce jets  fender & hendry 2000 ) . in some cases ( e.g. gx 339 - 4 ; fig 6 )",
    "this correlation is very tight . adopting the classical picture of hard x - ray production via comptonisation",
    ", this broad correlation implies the simultaneous presence of a comptonising corona and synchrotron - emitting ( and therefore relativistic ) jet in ` hard ' accretion ` states ' .",
    "this may suggest that the ` base ' of the jet , within a few hundred schwarzschild radii of the compact object , is providing the hot electrons for the comptonisation process ( fender et al .",
    "1999b ) , although models for comptonisation in the low / hard state of bhcs favour a thermal population of electrons in the corona ( poutanen 1998 and references therein ) . more radically",
    ", the signature of the jet may extend to much higher energies than the radio regime , and may even challenge the comptonisation model of hard x - ray production ( markoff et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the relation of jets to the presence of @xmath0-ray ( @xmath1 500 kev ) emission is less clear , and further systematic studies ( with e.g. integral ) are required .",
    "however , given that radio jets , with their population of very high energy electrons , are natural sites for the production of high energy photons via both inverse compton scattering ( atoyan & aharonian 1999 ; paredes et al . 2000 ) and maybe even direct synchrotron emission ( markoff et al . 2000 ) such connections should be investigated in detail in the future .",
