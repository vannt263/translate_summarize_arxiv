    "the local - density approximation ( lda ) is the simplest approximation within density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "it was first introduced by kohn and sham ( ks ) in 1965 to treat systems with slowly varying density @xcite .",
    "it assumes that a real , non - uniform system can be treated as a collection of infinitesimally - small uniform electron gases ( uegs ) of density @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in principle , if one knows the reduced ( i.e. per electron ) correlation energy @xmath3 of the ueg for any density @xmath0 , one is able , by suming the individual contributions over all space , to obtain the lda correlation energy @xmath4 \\,d{\\mathbf{r}}.\\ ] ] in the lda , the correlation functional @xmath5 $ ] is based on the infinite ueg ( iueg ) paradigm @xcite  a model built by allowing the number @xmath2 of electrons in a volume @xmath6 to approach infinity with @xmath7 held constant  and analytically constructed @xcite by combining accurate quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations @xcite and exact results from the high - density @xcite and low - density @xcite limits .",
    "although it describes molecular bonding reasonably well compared to the thomas - fermi model @xcite , this rather crude approximation had mixed success @xcite .",
    "its main drawback is due to the large error in correlation energies , which are too large roughly by a factor two @xcite .",
    "however , a subtle compensation of error between exchange and correlation makes the total energy usually in good agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the birth of the generalized local - density approximation ( glda ) supervenes from the observation that a ueg of density @xmath0 is not uniquely defined @xcite .",
    "indeed , we showed that two uegs with same density can have different correlation energies depending on the ueg `` finiteness '' .",
    "thus , inspired by a number of previous researchers @xcite , we introduced a new local two - electron parameter @xmath1 measuring the tightness of the correlation hole around an electron @xcite .    from a practical point of view , at the hartree - fock ( hf ) or ks level of theory , the hf / ks dimensionless hole curvature is , in @xmath8 dimensions , @xmath9 where the hf / ks conditional intracule @xmath10 measures the proximity of other electrons to one at @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the diagonal part of the second - order density matrix @xcite . in eq .  , @xmath13 is the hf / ks kinetic energy density , @xmath14 is the von weizscker kinetic energy density , and @xmath15 is the kinetic energy density of the ( ferromagnetic ) iueg @xcite ( where @xmath16 is the gamma function @xcite ) . because the @xmath1 parameter defined in requires only the orbitals and their gradient , it can be easily evaluated with conventional quantum chemistry softwares .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is also related to the inhomogeneity parameter used to construct exchange functionals within the meta - generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "using the `` exact '' hole curvature would be probably more appropriate . however , this quantity is hardly accessible except for small systems @xcite .",
    "although the choice of the one- and two - electron parameters is not uniquely defined , in combination with the usual one - electron density parameter @xmath0 , the hole curvature @xmath1 provides an unambiguous definition of a ueg , and the glda correlation energy is @xcite @xmath17 \\,d{\\mathbf{r}}.\\ ] ] like the lda , the glda can be used for atomic , molecular and periodic systems .",
    "our first investigation of the glda performance for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems @xcite showed very promising results using a non - self - consistent post - hf procedure . in ref @xcite",
    ", we built a glda correlation functional @xmath18 $ ] based on the `` electrons - on - a - ring '' paradigm ( also called ringium ) which corresponds to electrons on a ring interacting _ through _ the ring @xcite ( see appendix [ app : ringium ] ) .    in the present study",
    ", we propose to follow a more conventional approach and explicitly build a glda correlation functional based on electrons on an infinitely thin wire with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) @xcite .",
    "these uegs can be seen as finite versions of the usual iueg , and feel particularly attractive in the development of glda functionals .",
    "note that the 1d iueg at intermediate densities has been intensively studied by lee and drummond @xcite , while its high - density correlation energy has been studied in details in ref .",
    "one of the aim of the present manuscript is to compare ring - based and wire - based models to build 1d glda functionals .",
    "because uegs can be created using various external potentials , it is important to know which of these paradigms is the more appropriate to model `` realistic '' systems .",
    "a comparison between the electrons - on - a - wire and electrons - on - a - ring models is given in appendix [ app : ringium ] .",
    "pbc are usually an issue in calculations on extended quantum systems because they inevitably introduce `` finite - size errors '' , one of the major limitations of the application of accurate many - body techniques to periodic systems @xcite .",
    "however , in this article , we propose to take advantage of these finite - size errors to build finite uegs .    in order to gather information to build the glda functional in sec .",
    "[ sec : glda ] , we perform a comprehensive study of these finite uegs for high , intermediate , and low densities using perturbation theory and quantum monte carlo calculations ( sec .  [",
    "sec : ueg ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , we show that this new glda correlation functional yields accurate correlation energies for both weakly and strongly correlated 1d systems . we discuss its generalization to higher - dimensional systems in sec .",
    "[ sec : ccl ] .",
    "atomic units are used throughout and correlation energies are reported in millihartree ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we consider uegs composed of @xmath2 electrons with coordinates @xmath20 on an infinitely thin wire of length @xmath21 with pbc @xcite .",
    "for sake of mathematical simplicity , we map the spatial dimension onto a ring of radius @xmath22 with coordinates @xmath23 $ ] and interelectronic distances @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "thus , the pbc are naturally fulfilled , and the uniform electronic density @xmath0 ( or equivalently the wigner - seitz radius @xmath25 ) is @xmath26 the hamiltonian of a @xmath2-electron ueg is @xmath27 , where the kinetic and potential operators are @xmath28 the non - interacting orbitals and their corresponding energies are @xmath29 with @xmath30 while the first - order density matrix is given by @xcite @xmath31 where the summation over the occupied orbitals is @xmath32    due to the pbc , the electron @xmath33 interacts with electron @xmath34 and all of electron @xmath34 s periodic images , with its own periodic images is part of the madelung energy , which is constant .",
    "thus , it can be omitted . ] and the ewald interaction potential is @xcite @xmath35    the electron - electron interaction in eq .   diverges when @xmath36 . in higher dimensions , as shown by kato @xcite , the divergence of the interaction energy is cancelled by an equal and opposite divergence in the kinetic energy . in 1d systems ,",
    "the curvature of the wave function is unable to compensate for the divergence in the this implies that the electronic wave function has nodes at all coalescence points ( i.e. when two electrons touch ) . in other words , additionally to the pauli exclusion principle which states that two electrons with same spin can not occupy the same state , the singularity of the coulomb operator enforces an opposite - spin version of the pauli exclusion principle which also forbids two electrons with opposite spin to occupy the same quantum state .",
    "consequently , as previously mentioned @xcite , the energy is independent of the spin - state for 1d systems and so we assume that all electrons are spin - up .",
    "note that , contrary to previous studies using quasi-1d coulomb operator with a transverse harmonic potential @xcite , here we use a strict-1d coulomb interaction .",
    "( a comparison of the two types of interaction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in the present study , we eschew the usual fictitious uniform positive background potential because its inclusion does not prevent a divergence of the coulomb energy in 1d systems .",
    "as shown below , the divergences induced by the infinite ewald interaction ( @xmath37 ) and the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath38 ) can be rigorously handled .      in the case of uniform electronic systems like the ones considered here ,",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are constant , and we have @xmath39 in 1d .",
    "thus , using eqs .   and , one finds @xcite @xmath40 as one can see , there is a one - to - one mapping between the electron number @xmath2 and the two - electron @xmath1 parameter .",
    "in other words , @xmath1 gives information on the `` finiteness '' of the ueg .",
    "two important points have to be noted .",
    "first , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath41 ) , the present model is equivalent to the usual iueg @xcite .",
    "second , because we only consider the ground - state properties of finite ( i.e. @xmath42 ) and infinite ( i.e. @xmath43 ) uegs , the present model only covers the range @xmath44 , as shown by eq .  .",
    "higher values of the hole curvature can be obtained by considering excited states .",
    "we are currently working on the extension of the glda based on ueg excited states @xcite .      due to the homogeneity of the system , it is straightforward to show that the hf wave function is a slater determinant built on the occupied non - interacting orbitals @xcite @xmath45 and the corresponding reduced hf energy is @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the non - interacting kinetic energy and @xmath48 is the sum of the coulomb and exchange energies : @xmath49 the double - bar integrals are @xmath50\\,d\\theta_1\\,d\\theta_2      \\\\      & =       \\begin{cases }          v_{c - b}(k ) - v_{c - a}(k ) ,     &    \\text{if $ a+b = c+d$ } ,          \\\\          0 ,               &    \\text{otherwise } ,      \\end{cases } \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath51 can be obtained in closed form for any value of the truncation order @xmath52 : @xmath53 + \\gamma - \\operatorname{ci}\\left[p(2k+1)\\,\\pi\\right]}{\\pi},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath55 is the cosine integral @xcite . note that , in 1d , both the coulomb and exchange energies diverge logarithmically with opposite rate due to the singularity of the coulomb operator for small interelectronic distances @xcite .",

    "[ tab : apps2 ] , we compute the correlation energy @xmath117 of 2-boxium and 2-hookium for various values of the box length @xmath21 and the harmonic force constant @xmath118 , respectively . for large @xmath21 or small @xmath118 ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is dominant and these systems are strongly correlated . in the opposite regime ( i.e. small @xmath21 or large @xmath118 ) , the kinetic energy dominates and these systems are said to be weakly correlated .",
    "our benchmark values are based on near - exact hylleraas ( hy ) calculations @xcite .",
    "these results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bo - ho ] . in the two bottom graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : bo - ho ] , we have plotted the difference in correlation energy @xmath119 for the three glda functionals .",
    "the results show that the glda functionals yield accurate results for the weak , intermediate and strong regimes of correlation with a maximum error of 1.3 @xmath19 , while the lda yields very poor estimates of the correlation energy for each regime . even for strongly correlated systems where dft functionals usually fail @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for alternative approaches ) , the glda functionals behave exceptionally well compared to the near - exact hylleraas results . again , except at very high density , the gldaw functional gives more accurate results than the ringium - based glda functionals ( gldar and rev - gldar )",
    ". however , the difference between these values are rather small , which shows the weak system - dependence of the glda method .",
    "in the present study , we have constructed a new generalized local - density approximation ( glda ) correlation functional based on finite uniform electron gases ( uegs ) built by considering electrons on an infinitely thin wire with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these uegs are finite versions of the ubiquitous infinite homogeneous electron gas , the cornerstone of the most popular density functional paradigm  the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we have performed a comprehensive study of these finite uegs at high , intermediate and low densities using perturbation theory and quantum monte carlo calculations .",
    "we have shown that this new functional yields very robust correlation energies for various inhomogeneous one - dimensional systems in both the strongly- and weakly - correlated regimes .",
    "the present approach can be easily extended to higher dimensions by computing the exchange and correlation energies of finite uniform electron gases for various spin - polarization @xcite using current qmc softwares @xcite . however , unlike the present case , the magnitude of the fixed - node errors has to be addressed and it has been shown that large differences in the fixed - node errors can appear depending on the degree of node nonlinearity @xcite . in the case of large fixed - node errors , the performance of the fci - qmc method developed by alavi and coworkers @xcite will be investigated .",
    "this method has no fixed - node error and it has been successfully applied to 3d uegs recently @xcite .",
    "the author thanks the australian research council for funding ( grant de130101441 and dp140104071 ) , the nci national facility for a generous grant of supercomputer time , and amy kendrick , neil drummond , mike towler and peter gill for stimulating discussions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system consisting of @xmath2 electrons on a ring of radius @xmath123 ( that we have also called ringium ) is @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the angle of electron @xmath33 around the ring center , @xmath126 is the across - the - ring distance between electrons @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the interelectronic distance is @xmath127 .",
    "compared to the hamitonian of @xmath2 electrons on an infinitely thin wire given by eq .  , one can see that the only difference between the two systems is the electron - electron interaction .",
    "in ringium , the interelectronic potential @xmath128 is periodic and the electrons interact `` through the ring '' ( see eq .  ) . in the electrons - on - a - wire paradigm , we use",
    "the ewald interaction potential given by which corresponds to an infinite summation of the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , because the system interacts with its own images , finite - size errors arise .",
    "it is interesting to compare the correlation energies obtained for various @xmath2 and @xmath25 values .",
    "correlation energies for the wire - based and ring - based systems are gathered in table [ tab : ec ] of the present manuscript and table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "as one can see , for a given value of @xmath2 and @xmath25 , the difference in correlation energy is very small .",
    "the largest difference is less than a millihartree for @xmath129 and @xmath72 .",
