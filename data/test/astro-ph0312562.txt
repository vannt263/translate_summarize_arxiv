    "theories of the structure , origin , development and effects of spiral arms in galaxies have occupied researchers ever since such structure was discovered in 1845 .",
    "many galaxies are observed with tightly - wound , regular spiral arms covering a significant fraction of their disc . the commonest model of this phenomenon",
    "is based on the lin - shu hypothesis of spiral structure @xcite , which states that quasi - steady spiral patterns exist in the stellar disc , rotate at a pattern speed @xmath2 , and persist for many orbits .",
    "the orbits of the stars are organised into ` kinematic density waves ' , which increase the stellar density in a spiral pattern .",
    "the stars themselves drift through the pattern inside the corotation radius , as they orbit with an angular velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the spiral density wave picture is by no means the only theory of spiral structure , but provides a very successful description .",
    "the possible origins , driving mechanisms and long - term support of such density waves has been the subject of a great deal of literature , and this subject is beyond the scope of this paper ; see reviews by @xcite and @xcite . it is generally accepted that spiral waves , if they do not naturally arise through instabilities , may be driven by nearby companions or central bars , and that under the right conditions they may persist for many rotations , and it is from this starting point that we proceed in this paper .",
    "galaxies that are optically classified as spirals usually have a clear spiral structure with one dominating mode , and arms are usually logarithmic in shape ( e.g.  they have a constant pitch angle ) @xcite .",
    "however , galaxies not classified as spirals are now known commonly to show spiral structure in their stellar discs .",
    "the old stellar population , which will trace the mass of the disc , can be observed in longer wavelengths such as the k or k@xmath4 bands . @xcite",
    "found ` broad spiral patterns ' in the discs of six spiral galaxies , concluding that smooth spiral structure exists in their mass distributions .",
    "@xcite examined several galaxies of different types , suggesting a class of galaxy which has flocculent structure at blue wavelengths and a spiral structure in k. more recently , @xcite showed that optical classification does not constrain the structure of stellar discs , finding smooth spiral structure in galactic discs independently of their optical structure .",
    "many galaxies optically classified as flocculent , when observed in k@xmath4 , show regular spiral structure @xcite .",
    "most of these have a central bar , and some also have a neighbour @xcite . the presence of regular spiral structure , but flocculent structure in bluer wavelengths , has also arisen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we make the distinction between three separate arm components : the peaks of the underlying stellar mass distribution , approximately tracing the perturbations in the gravitational potential ( the p - arms ) , the shock fronts of the gas , which will generally be observed from dust ( the d - arms ) , and the ridges of enhanced star formation ( the sf - arms ) .",
    "many tightly - wound spiral galaxies are known .",
    "assuming that the model of a rotating spiral potential is accurate , the parameters of that potential are fundamental to the galaxies themselves .",
    "an understanding of the structure of spiral arms is important in considering the processes affecting the ism flowing through them . in this paper , we focus on the determination of the corotation radius .",
    "we discuss the formation of single - shock flows in the gaseous disc , and show how the angular offset between these shocks ( the d - arms ) and the minima of the gravitational potential ( the p - arms ) could be used to constrain corotation . in section [ model ] , we introduce the model spiral potential , to which the gas responds .",
    "section [ response ] investigates the resulting gas flow using a well known semi - analytical approach , and compares the results to those obtained by numerical methods . in section",
    "[ offset ] , different components of spiral arms are discussed , and the offset function @xmath5 is introduced .",
    "various ways to constrain corotation are summarised in section [ corotation ] , and the use of the offset function to provide an additional constraint is explained .",
    "finally , our findings are summarised in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the rigidly rotating potential of a spiral galaxy can be decomposed into a static , axisymmetric part and a spiral perturbation .",
    "we define the gravitational potential @xmath6 ( in galactocentric polar coordinates @xmath7 ) as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the axisymmetric potential and @xmath10 is the spiral perturbation .",
    "the axisymmetric part represents the unperturbed velocity curve . in this paper , the following velocity curve is used : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the limit of the circular velocity at large radius , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the inverse disc and bulge scale lengths ( respectively ) and @xmath15 is the bulge strength parameter @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath9 that produces this velocity curve is @xmath16 where the exponential integral @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18    a spiral perturbation with one mode is given by the general form @xmath19 where the spiral phase @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 and the pattern has @xmath22 arms .",
    "the pattern rotates rigidly at angular velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the radial shape of the arms is set by the function @xmath23 , and at constant radius , the potential is sinusoidal in @xmath24 with period @xmath25 .",
    "the overall amplitude is set by @xmath26 .",
    "the equipotentials of each mode are spirals , which have an inclination @xmath27 to circles .",
    "trailing logarithmic arms , with a constant inclination @xmath28 , correspond the choice @xmath29    it is convenient to define the perturbation strength @xmath30 as the ratio of the amplitude of the perturbation force to the axisymmetric force : @xmath31 where the circular velocity at radius @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "the radial and time variation of the amplitude can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "a suitable radial choice is to specify @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the inverse spiral scale length , and the overall amplitude at any time is set by @xmath36 . in this paper",
    "we are interested in steady solutions in which the potential has reached a stable state , so that @xmath37 is independent of time .",

    "a relatively small perturbation can have a significant effect on the flow of gas through it .",
    "large deviations from the circular flow can lead to the formation of shocks . in this section",
    "we examine the formation of single - shock solutions in the flow of isothermal gas through the spiral potential . since the intent is to examine the large - scale behaviour , and ignore small - scale processes , approximations of initial uniformity and isothermality are appropriate . here , the sound speed used is an ` effective ' sound speed equal to the velocity dispersion of the ism , a good approximation for the time and length scales involved @xcite .",
    "in this paper we repeat the procedure used in @xcite for finding non - linear solutions ( containing a shock ) to the asymptotic equations of gas flow under a spiral perturbation .",
    "the derivation of the equations and descriptions of the procedure are given in @xcite and @xcite and are only briefly described here .",

    "the passage from one arm to the next corresponds to a period of @xmath54 in @xmath51 , regardless of the number of arms .",
    "the velocity of the gas is written in components @xmath55 in this coordinate system .",
    "these are then expressed as the sum of the ` base ' flow @xmath56 ( the equilibrium circular flow when the perturbation is not present , in the stationary frame of the perturbation ) and a perturbed velocity @xmath57 . in the specific case of logarithmic arms",
    "the coordinates can be defined as follows : @xmath58 @xmath59    the differential equations in @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the technique for locating appropriate solutions , are given in appendix [ appendix ] .",

    "solutions are found along streamlines under the approximation that they are at nearly constant radius , and the surface density @xmath62 is then found from the velocity .",
    "the solution at a given radius is controlled by seven parameters , under the approximation that they are constant along a streamline :    @xmath22 ( the number of arms )    @xmath2 ( the pattern speed of the arms )    @xmath28 ( the local pitch angle )    @xmath46 ( the local relative arm strength )    @xmath33 ( the unperturbed circular velocity )    @xmath63 ( the local epicyclic frequency )    @xmath64 ( the effective sound speed of the gas )    base - supersonic flow is defined as any flow with @xmath65 , so that in the stationary frame of the arms , the unperturbed flow perpendicular to the equipotentials is supersonic .",

    "this , of course , occurs either side of the corotation radius in a band where the relative velocity @xmath67 is sufficiently small . in this region ,",
    "the response of the gas , and the asymptotic flow solutions , will be qualitatively different .",
    "the base - subsonic region is bounded by the radii satisfying @xmath68 .    if for the whole solution @xmath69 ( entirely subsonic ) or @xmath70 ( entirely supersonic )",
    ", the solution will not contain a shock .",
    "this will occur under conditions where the sound speed @xmath64 is very high or low , or the strength @xmath46 of the perturbation is sufficiently small . in the limit of small @xmath46 ,",

    "if the strength @xmath46 of the perturbation is gradually increased , starting from an entirely subsonic solution , then at some point the flow will be sufficiently perturbed that @xmath74 will pass the sound speed @xmath64 .",
    "any solution must now contain a sonic point , at which the gas accelerates to supersonic velocities , and a shock .",
    "such solutions are no longer symmetric .",

    "the equations are based on the approximation that the gravitational field is in the @xmath51 direction ( and hence that the shock is parallel to the equipotentials ) , which will hold for large @xmath79 or ( equivalently ) @xmath80 , so that the spiral arms are tightly wound and @xmath23 varies rapidly . in more open",
    "spirals the equations therefore break down .",
    "also , the parameters are approximated as constant along a streamline , which will be a good approximation only if @xmath46 is not much larger than @xmath81 . in our experience , solutions are difficult or impossible to find for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( with all other parameters as indicated in table [ standardmodel ] ) .    within parameters that satisfy these approximations ,",
    "solutions still may not exist .",
    "in particular , solutions in the base - subsonic region are difficult to find , as discussed in appendix [ appendix ] . in many cases , although shock solutions can be found , no solution of the correct periodicity exists .",
    "many solutions show secondary peaks in the density .",
    "these occur especially near the ultraharmonic resonances , where higher harmonic terms in the solution become important .",
    "if a secondary peak crosses the sonic line , a second shock will occur .",
    "it will therefore become impossible to locate a single - shock solution , since a singularity will be present at the second sonic point .",

    "the radius at which these arms cross should , therefore , correspond to corotation .",
    "this point is mentioned by @xcite , but they failed to observe such a crossing .",
    "@xcite proposed that observations in the b and v bands could allow the variation of stellar age across an arm to be determined , and that corotation should correspond to the radius at which this trend reverses angular direction .",
    "@xcite attempted to locate corotation in two galaxies by this method , performing a fourier analysis on observations in b and i bands .",

    "this will always be inherently difficult , since the existence , location and shape of the sf - arm are neither expected , nor observed , to be very regular . as discussed in the introduction , galaxies with regular structure in p - arms will often be classified as flocculent in optical observations , meaning that they do not possess regular sf - arms . as pointed out by @xcite , one would expect the stimulation of star formation in shock fronts to be followed by a ` shuffling ' of material , including feedback from star formation , random structure from the condensation of dense clouds and so forth .",
    "the appearance of any sf - arm would therefore be much more irregular , and in the right circumstances will appear entirely flocculent .",
    "the observation of these arms is further hampered by the effects of dust obscuration , which can make it difficult to locate their full extent .",

    "the singularity is hidden and replaced by a forbidden region of phase space , namely the requirement that @xmath150 .",
    "this will be satisfied so long as the correct boundary condition is used ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "the procedure for locating the shock is as follows .",
    "the flow is integrated from @xmath138 along the supersonic and subsonic branches , to give @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "generally , the supersonic branch will eventually return to the singularity at @xmath154 and can not be further integrated , while the subsonic branch either tends asymptotically to @xmath155 , or also reaches @xmath154 .",
    "if a consistent solution exists , then the shock will terminate both branches before they reach singularities .",
    "for every point along the supersonic branch @xmath156 , the isothermal jump conditions can be used to calculate the post - shock velocity @xmath157 that the flow would have if the shock were to occur at that particular value of @xmath51 .",
    "since the shock is perpendicular to the @xmath51 direction and the gas is isothermal , the jump condition is simply @xmath158 and so the post - shock branch is defined ( in terms of the dimensionless parameters ) by @xmath159 through the shock , @xmath33 should be continuous , but @xmath71 should drop from @xmath156 to @xmath157 . in a consistent solution , the shock joins the supersonic branch to the subsonic branch at the same value of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the only consistent location for the shock exists where the post - shock branch crosses the subsonic branch in the @xmath160 plane .",
    "this process is shown visually in figure [ shocklocation ] .",
    "the starting value of @xmath138 must be adjusted until a shock location appears , at a point on each branch before they reach a singularity .",

    "is calculated for each point along the supersonic branch using the jump conditions .",
    "it crosses the subsonic branch at the appropriate location for the shock ( circle ) .",
    "the shock , indicated by the long dashed line , closes the velocity curve .",
    "flow proceeds in an anticlockwise direction .",
    "the value of @xmath138 should now be adjusted until the period in @xmath51 of the solution reaches @xmath54 .",
    "the unperturbed flow corresponds to @xmath161 ( cross).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the location of the crossing point is found numerically by minimising @xmath162 with respect to @xmath163 and @xmath164 , which are the values of @xmath51 on the subsonic and supersonic branch ( respectively ) at which the shock occurs .",
    "the period in @xmath51 of the solution will therefore be @xmath165 .",
    "in general , for a given value of the sonic point @xmath138 , this period will not be @xmath76 .",
    "the starting value of @xmath138 must therefore be adjusted , repeating the shock location procedure at each value , until a solution is found with a period of @xmath76 .",
    "if such a value can be found , it represents the only physical solution to the flow equations , containing one isothermal shock .",
    "the density @xmath166 can be calculated from the values of @xmath71 .",
    "solutions in the base - subsonic region are particularly hard to find .",
    "this is because the integrated branches depend very sensitively on the value of @xmath138 . in some cases",
