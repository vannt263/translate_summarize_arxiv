    "the spin degree of freedom of electrons in semiconductor nanostructures has attracted much interest recently . besides its applications in spintronics@xcite , which makes use of the spin in the same way as the charge in conventional devices",
    ", there has been considerable interest in the quantum coherence of spin in different materials and geometries at the nanoscale @xcite .",
    "the long coherence times measured some time ago in semiconductors @xcite supported the idea of quantum computing with spins localized in quantum dots @xcite  a rapidly growing field now , where recent experimental progress has been remarkable @xcite .",
    "electron spins in semiconductor nanostructures , however , are not decoupled from the charge degree of freedom , one of the primary reasons for this coupling being the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this coupling leads to many interesting phenomena in the physics of semiconductors @xcite , an important one being the ability to control the spin of the electron with electric fields acting on its charge degrees of freedom @xcite . in quantum dots",
    "the spin - orbit interaction manifests itself as a weak perturbation when compared with the confinement energy .",
    "the measure of smallness is given by the ratio between the dot radius @xmath2 and the spin - orbit length , @xmath3the distance over which an electron travels and thereby precesses by an angle @xmath4 about the intrinsic magnetic field induced by the spin - orbit interaction . despite its smallness",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is very important for the coherence of the spin dynamics .",
    "for example , spin - orbit interaction allows for coupling of the electron spin to ( bosonic ) environments , such as phonons @xcite or particle - hole excitations in quantum point contacts @xcite , which in turn causes relaxation and decoherence of the spins .",
    "moreover , electrons being charged particles interact via the long range coulomb forces with each other , even if they are confined to well - separated quantum dots with no overlap of their wave functions . through this electrostatic coupling and in combination with the spin orbit interaction , the spins of two electrons located in different dots become coupled even in the absence of tunneling between the dots .    in this paper",
    "we provide a detailed analysis of such an effective spin - spin interaction for lateral quantum dots in a configuration as shown in fig .",
    "we will see that the origin of this interaction is the `` tidal '' effect each of the electrons produces on the charge distribution of the other electron via electrostatic forces .",
    "because of the spin - orbit interaction , the electric dipole moment ( as well as higher moments ) in each dot couples to its electron spin . as a result ,",
    "the two spins experience an interaction resembling a magnetic dipole - dipole interaction@xcite with effective magnetic moments which can be strongly enhanced by up to a factor of @xmath5 compared to the bohr magneton .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - spin coupling obtained via this spin - electric effect can be efficiently controlled and even completely suppressed by adjusting external parameters such as the magnetic field direction , strength , and inter - dot distance .",
    "the spin - spin interaction can , in principle , be used to perform two - qubit operations as required in the spin - based quantum computing scheme@xcite , because it entangles spins and can easily be switched on and off .",
    "we note that a similar mechanism for spin interaction based on electrostatic coupling was studied very recently in ref .   for vertically coupled quantum dots , and in ref .",
    "for the special case of one - dimensional quantum dots formed in semiconducting nanowires . besides the differences in geometry and dimensionality , both of these works treat only the case of weak coulomb interaction ( compared to the level spacing ) , while we treat here also the opposite limit of strong coulomb interaction where new and interesting features emerge . in the limiting case of strongly elliptical dots",
    "we recover the one - dimensional results obtained in ref .  .",
    "we emphasize again that in the present study we exclude tunneling and thus the type of spin interaction studied in the following is fundamentally different from the heisenberg exchange interaction for which the presence of electron tunneling between the dots is crucial@xcite .",
    "similarly , the combined effect of heisenberg exchange interaction and spin - orbit coupling@xcite is also based on tunneling and should be carefully distinguished from the spin - orbit effect studied here .",
    "we also note that the heisenberg exchange coupling allows typically for much stronger spin - spin coupling than the electrostatically induced one .",
    "for instance , in gaas dots the heisenberg exchange can reach values on the order of @xmath6 mev @xmath7 mev , which , as we shall see , exceeds the electrostatically induced spin coupling by three to four orders of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the electrostatic spin coupling can prove useful for cases where it is difficult to get sufficient wave function overlap ( needed for large heisenberg exchange ) , and , moreover , it is also important to understand the electrostatic spin - effects in detail in order to get control over possible interference effects between different types of spin coupling .",
    "this will be for example of importance for spin qubit applications in order to minimize spin decoherence and gate errors .",
    "finally , in view of experimental tests we propose a scheme to measure the spin - spin interaction in a double dot setup with a nearby charge detector .",
    "we propose to combine the spin - measurement technique of ref .   with the entangling property of the spin - spin interaction and",
    "present a gate pulsing sequence that enables one to access the coupling constant in the time domain by measuring the occupation probability of a zeeman sublevel .",

    "<S> we study the spin - spin coupling between two single - electron quantum dots due to the coulomb and spin - orbit interactions , in the absence of tunneling between the dots . </S>",
    "<S> we find an anisotropic @xmath0 spin - spin interaction that is proportional to the zeeman splitting produced by the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is studied both in the limit of weak and strong coulomb repulsion with respect to the level spacing of the dot . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is found to be a non - monotonic function of inter - dot distance @xmath1 and external magnetic field , and , moreover , vanishes for some special values of @xmath1 and/or magnetic field orientation . </S>",

    "<S> we propose a scheme to measure this spin - spin interaction based on the spin - relaxation - measurement technique . </S>"
