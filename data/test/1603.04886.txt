    "a massive star ends its life as a supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "this leaves behind a supernova remnant ( snr ) and sometimes creates a rapidly rotating pulsar .",
    "a pulsar can produce an outflow of a magnetic field and relativistic particles referred to as a pulsar wind .",
    "the interaction between such a pulsar wind and the ambient medium , i.e.  the sn ejecta for pulsars embedded in snrs , results in a termination shock , beyond which the shocked wind materials inflate a broadband synchrotron - emitting bubble known as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn )",

    ". a pwn first expands supersonically inside its associated snr .",
    "the next stage starts when the sn reverse shock , which is driven inward by the interaction between the ejecta and the interstellar medium , crushes the pwn .",
    "the interplay between the shockwave and the pwn is complex and will cause the pwn to reverberate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "after the effect of the reverse shock fades away , the pwn will expand subsonically into the snr .",
    "since a pulsar is generally born with high space velocity , it can be significantly off - centered with respect to the snr during the reverberation stage and can protrude from its own pwn because of the reverse shock interaction @xcite .",
    "this can result in a complicated pwn morphology consisting of a `` relic '' component and an elongated `` head '' bridging between the relic and the pulsar @xcite . as the pulsar continues to travel toward the edge of the snr ,",
    "its motion will eventually become supersonic because the local sound speed in an snr decreases moving outward .",
    "the ram pressure acting on the pulsar wind due to the pulsar s supersonic motion will deform the pwn into a bow shock . for even older systems , the pulsar can escape from its associated snr shell and drive a bow - shock pwn into the interstellar medium .    broadband emission from pwne can be observed from the radio to @xmath1-rays . in the radio regime",
    ", a pwn emits through the synchrotron process , and the emission is often highly linear polarized because of the ordered magnetic field configuration .",
    "a radio pwn is characterized by a centrally filled morphology and a flat spectrum , with a spectral index of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum can extend to the x - ray band where the spectrum is usually steeper than that in the radio due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "gev and tev @xmath1-ray emission from pwne has also been detected , which is due to inverse - compton scattering ( see the review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one interesting area to explore in the study of pwne is the interaction with the sn reverse shocks .",
    "theoretically , hydrodynamical ( hd ) modeling shows that the interplay can give rise to turbulence in pwne @xcite .",

    "we formed radio images for the four bands , adopting the multifrequency synthesis technique @xcite which can further improve the _ u - v _ coverage .",
    "in particular , the 20 cm continuum image was formed by extracting line - free channels from the data .",
    "uniform weighting was used for the 20 , 13 , and 6 cm images to reduce sidelobes and to improve the spatial resolution .",
    "for the 3 cm image , due to the lower signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio in this band , we used a weighting parameter of ` robust ` @xmath31 @xcite to optimize the balance between the noise level and spatial resolution .",
    "we then applied a maximum entropy algorithm @xcite to deconvolve all of the dirty maps . for 20 and 13 cm ,",
    "the task ` maxen ` was employed ; for 6 and 3 cm , we used the task ` pmosmem ` @xcite to deconvolve the stokes _ i _ , _ q _ , and _ u _ maps simultaneously .",

    "we also formed images with visibilities from the 6 km baselines only in an attempt to identify point sources .",
    "identical data reduction and imaging procedures as above were used , except that natural weighting was used to form the images in order to reduce the noise .    for polarimetry , we formed a new set of low - resolution 3 cm images matching that at 6 cm in order to make a direct comparison between the two bands and generate a rotation measure ( rm ) map ( see section  [ sec : rm ] ) .",
    "a gaussian taper has been applied to the visibility data by setting the parameter of ` fwhm ` @xmath40 , @xmath41 in the task ` invert ` .",

    "we blanked out areas where either the polarized intensity has s / n @xmath43 5 or the total intensity has s / n @xmath43 12 .",
    "note that polarization was not measured at 20 cm and the 13 cm data are not useful , since the stokes _ q _ and _ u _ maps are corrupted by severe polarization leakage from a nearby bright h  ii region g327.3@xmath00.6 .",
    "this is due to a flaw in the feedhorn design of the old atca receiver .    for the h  i data",
    ", we used the task ` uvlin ` to separate line emission from continuum emission within the 20 cm data .",
    "we then smoothed the line spectrum to a resolution of @xmath44 in velocity . to filter out large - scale structures , only data with",
    "_ u - v _ distances shorter than @xmath45 were selected to form the line images .",
    "we found that the source is too weak to determine any h  i absorption .",
    "a composite radio image of snr g327.1@xmath01.1 at 36 cm ( most ; * ? ? ? * ) and 6 cm ( atca ) is shown in figure  [ fig : g327]a , featuring both the snr shell and the pwn .",
    "radio intensity maps of the pwn at 20 , 13 , 6 , and 3 cm ( all from atca ) are shown in figure  [ fig : int ] .",
    "the nebula exhibits similar morphology over the observed wavelengths .",
    "it has a main circular structure with a diameter of @xmath46 and a finger - like structure of length @xmath47 protruding toward the northwest .",
    "together with the two x - ray prongs ahead of the radio finger , the whole pwn resembles a snail .",
    "we thus refer to the entire pwn as `` the snail '' : the circular structure is the `` body '' and the protrusion is the    `` head . ''",
    "a more detailed look at the body revealed two features  `` the bay '' to the southwest and `` the apex '' to the northwest ( see figure  [ fig : structure ] ) .",
    "the bay is an indented area to the body , while the apex is a sharp corner at the body s boundary .",
    "faint emission is detected outside of the bay at 20 and 6 cm ( about @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ) , and was also found in the most image @xcite .",
    "the emission is not obvious in the 13 and 3 cm images .",
    "this could be attributed to the contamination of the 13 cm image by the snr , while at 3 cm it could be too faint to be detected , or could have been resolved out because of insufficient _ u - v _ coverage ( see section  [ sec : spec ] ) . on a larger scale , hints of an snr shell of diameter @xmath50",
    "are seen in the 20 and 13 cm images ( not shown in the field of view of figure  [ fig : int ] ) .",
    "since the shortest baseline of the 6 and 3 cm observations is 31 m , which translates to angular scales of about @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , we do not expect these observations to be sensitive to the snr shell .",
    "the 13 , 6 , and 3 cm images clearly reveal small - scale structure within the body .",
    "we discovered filaments running through the pwn with an unresolved width by our observations .",
    "these filaments seem to form loop - like structures that are typically @xmath53 diameter .",
    "there are two point sources near the northern edge of the body .",
    "the eastern one is located at ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; j2000.0 ) and the western one is at ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ; j2000.0 ) .",
    "these are marked in figure  [ fig : structure ] .",
    "both point sources are unresolved in the 6 km baseline images , and therefore are less than @xmath58 in extent .",
    "the head has an extent of about @xmath59 long and @xmath60 wide , and shows uniform surface brightness ( @xmath61 at 6 cm , and @xmath62 at 3 cm ) , except near the tip ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; j2000.0 ) where it shows a peak with @xmath65 at 6 cm and @xmath66 at 3 cm .",
    "the radio peak is extended , with a size of @xmath67 elongated along the head , and is offset from the x - ray point source by @xmath68 to the southeast .",
    "no radio counterparts of the x - ray prongs and arc outside of the head are detected .",
    "careful examination of the 6 km baseline images shows no counterparts of the x - ray point source with a @xmath69 upper limit of @xmath70 at 6 cm .      to measure the pwn flux density , we employed a source region enclosing both the body and the head as shown in figure  [ fig : int ] .",
    "the eastern point source is believed to be a background source while the western point source might be a compact structure within the pwn ( see section  [ sec : ewsrc ] ) .",
    "therefore , we defined a circular exclusion region of @xmath71 diameter centered at the former .",
    "we tried different background regions within the snr shell , and the difference gives us a handle on the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table : flux ] .",
    "the flux densities of the pwn are @xmath72 , @xmath17 , @xmath20 , @xmath73 , and @xmath25 at 36 , 20 , 13 , 6 , and 3 cm , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by the systematic uncertainties associated with background subtraction , as the statistical uncertainties are relatively small ( a few mjy ) .",
    "we note that the value we find at 36 cm ( 2.3jy ) is slightly larger than that ( 2.0jy ) reported by @xcite .",
    "this could be attributed to our different choice of regions .",
    "the radio spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : radiospec ] .",
    "fitting the flux densities at 36 , 20 , 13 , and 6 cm with a power law ( @xmath74 ) gives a spectral index of @xmath75 , and extrapolation to 3 cm suggests a flux density of @xmath76 , which is almost @xmath77 higher than the observed value of @xmath78 .",
    "if we directly join the 6 and 3 cm data points , then we obtain @xmath79 between the two bands .",
    "the shortest _ u - v _ spacing at 3 cm is about @xmath80 , corresponding to an angular scale of @xmath81 .",
    "this sets a rough upper limit on the size of structures that our observations are sensitive to . in order to see if the missing flux problem is significant , we formed a 6 cm radio image only with _",
    "u - v _ distance larger than @xmath80 , using identical procedure as described in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "this results in about @xmath82 loss in flux density of the pwn , suggesting that the 3 cm observations may not be sensitive to the larger - scale emission of the pwn .",
    "we also determined the flux densities of the body and the head of the snail separately , with the results also listed in table  [ table : flux ] .",
    "the flux densities and fitted spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : radiospec ] .",
    "for the body , the flux densities are @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath26 at 36 , 20 , 13 , 6 , and 3 cm , respectively , and fitting the flux densities between 36 and 6 cm with a power - law spectrum gives a spectral index of @xmath75 . for the head ,",
    "the flux densities are @xmath16 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 at 36 , 20 , 13 , 6 , and 3 cm , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of the head appears to be peculiar , as the observed flux density is lower at 36 cm than that at 20 cm .",
    "we believe that the flux density measurement of the head could be affected by faint sidelobes from g327.3@xmath00.6 at 36 cm .",
    "we fitted the flux densities of the head between 20 and 3 cm , as the size of the head is only about @xmath59 long and @xmath60 wide , and should be well sampled by our 3 cm observations .",
    "the resulting power - law spectrum has a spectral index of @xmath87 .",
    "the flux densities of the eastern point source are found to be @xmath88 at 6 cm and @xmath89 at 3 cm , while those for the western point source are @xmath90 at 6 cm and @xmath91 at 3 cm .",
    "these are very rough estimates , as the diffuse emission from the pwn precludes precise measurements .",
    "the results suggest an inverted spectrum with @xmath92 for the eastern point source and @xmath93 for the western point source .",
    "maps of the polarization fraction of the snail at 6 and 3 cm are shown in figure  [ fig : pm ] .",
    "overall , the pwn is highly linearly polarized .",
    "the typical polarization fraction of the body is about @xmath94 and @xmath82 at 6 and 3 cm , respectively , while that along the head is correspondingly about @xmath82 and @xmath95 . at a smaller scale",
    ", we found a highly polarized core inside the body as enclosed by an inner contour in figure  [ fig : pm ] , with polarization fractions of about @xmath95 and @xmath77 at 6 and 3 cm , respectively .",
    "near the northern edge of the body , the eastern point source is unpolarized , while the western point source is about @xmath96 polarized at both bands .",
    "note that the actual polarization fraction at 3 cm could be lower due to the missing flux problem as mentioned .",
    "finally , the polarization fraction at the edge of the body may be overestimated because we have used only a single rms value for the debiasing procedure .",
    "we generated an rm map by comparing between the polarization pa maps at 6 and 3 cm : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the observed pas in the respective bands , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the center wavelengths of the bands .",
    "the resulting rm map is shown in figure  [ fig : rm ] , and the rm is found to vary smoothly between @xmath102 and @xmath103 across the pwn with a typical uncertainty of @xmath104 .",
    "the average rm value is about @xmath105 .",
    "one problem of determining the rm this way is the so - called @xmath106 ambiguity .",
    "this ambiguity arises because an rm of larger magnitude can also be compatible with the observed polarization vectors if it provides an addition of multiples of @xmath107 radian to the relative rotation between the two bands .",
    "for example , adding an extra rm of @xmath108 can rotate the polarization vectors at 6 and 3 cm by @xmath109 relative to each other . in order to eradicate this problem",
    ", we picked the first and last channels of the 6 cm data , which are at frequencies of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , and formed pa maps separately using procedures identical to those of the full - band data . by applying the pa maps",
    ", we generated an rm map from the two channels .",
    "because the individual pixels of the rm map have large uncertainty , we did not attempt to investigate the spatial distribution of the rm from it .",
    "instead , we averaged the rm across the entire pwn to boost the s / n ratio , and found an average rm for the snail of @xmath112 from the two channels , which is identical to the value obtained above .",
    "since we expect the rotation of the pa within the 6 cm band to be small ( less than @xmath109 , otherwise the bandwidth depolarization would have been significant ) , this rules out the @xmath106 ambiguity in our measurements .",
    "we employed the rm map obtained from section  [ sec : rm ] to derotate the polarization vectors at 6 and 3 cm in order to infer the intrinsic magnetic field orientation of the pwn .",
    "since the rm was derived from the pas at 6 and 3 cm only , the derotated vectors at the two bands have identical orientation .",
    "the derotated vectors have a typical uncertainty of about @xmath113 , contributed by both the error in pa and in rm .",
    "figure  [ fig : bfield ] shows the projected intrinsic magnetic field orientation of the snail .",
    "overall , the field is highly ordered .",
    "the magnetic field at the head aligns with the pwn elongation , while for the body it is tangential to the boundary , except at the apex where it becomes radial .",
    "the field configuration of the interior of the body is complex with the magnetic field generally following the filamentary loops .",
    "the snail is believed to have first encountered the reverse shock about @xmath114 ago , as suggested by hd simulations @xcite .",
    "this could have resulted in a turbulent environment in the pwn and given rise to a tangled magnetic field geometry .",
    "the strong polarization signal we found from the snail indicates the presence of a highly ordered magnetic field .",
    "this could reflect a turbulence scale larger than the beam size of our observations . in this case",
    ", the beam depolarization will be insignificant and the observed magnetic field geometry will appear ordered at small scales . for further investigation ,",
    "mhd efforts are required to fully understand the highly ordered magnetic field found in the snail .",
    "the magnetic field in the head of the snail shows good alignment with the elongation of the structure ( see figure  [ fig : bfield ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the evolutionary picture suggested by @xcite , assuming that the magnetic field lines are frozen in the newly generated pulsar wind being pushed to the southeast .",
    "similar magnetic field geometry is also found in some bow - shock pwne , including the `` handle '' of the frying pan ( g315.78@xmath00.23 ; * ? ? ? * ) and the tail of the mouse ( g359.23@xmath00.82 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a distinctly different example is the bow - shock system g319.9@xmath00.7 , which shows a helical magnetic field which then aligns with the flow further downstream @xcite .",
    "the cause of such a peculiar configuration is not well understood , though it may be related to the mach number of the pulsar with respect to its ambient medium or the relative inclination of the spin axis and the elongation of the pwn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the head of the snail is believed to be a non - bow - shock system ( i.e.  the mach number of the neutron star @xmath115 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it serves as an example showing that magnetic field can align with subsonic comet - like pwne .",
    "we also compare the field geometry around the presumed pulsar with those of a few evolved pwne , including vela x @xcite , the boomerang ( g106.6@xmath1162.9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and da 495 ( g65.7@xmath1161.2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these pwne could also have been crushed by the reverse shocks .",
    "the boomerang and da 495 have diameters of about @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "they are considerably smaller than the snail , which has a length of the head spanning @xmath118 and the diameter of the body stretching @xmath119 .",
    "the radio polarimetric observation of vela x @xcite only covered the immediate vicinity ( @xmath120 ) around the vela pulsar . in the boomerang and vela x , toroidal magnetic fields can be observed , while in da 495 it was suggested to present a toroidal component superimposed on the apparently dipolar field structure .",
    "the magnetic field structures in these three pwne could be driven by the pulsar itself @xcite , while in the head of the snail the magnetic field lines parallel to the nebulae elongation can be shaped by the passage of the reverse shock .",
    "note that the physical scale for which we have resolution of in the snail is very different from that of the three presented above .",
    "future high - resolution studies may potentially probe the pulsar - driven field near the presumed pulsar of the snail .",
    "the high spatial resolution atca images in figure  [ fig : int ] revealed the filamentary structure inside the pwn .",
    "the filamentary loops generally align with the magnetic field ( see figure  [ fig : bfield ] ) , suggesting that they could be magnetic loops similar to those observed in young pwne 3c 58 @xcite and g54.1@xmath1160.3 @xcite . in the snail ,",
    "the filamentary loops have a typical diameter of @xmath53 , which corresponds to @xmath121 at a distance of @xmath122 .",
    "the scale is a few times larger than those in 3c 58 and g54.1@xmath1160.3 , which were estimated to have diameters of about @xmath123@xmath124 and @xmath125@xmath126 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that kink instabilities can be the origin of magnetic loops in pwne  the toroidal field near the termination shock could be torn away and eventually become a magnetic loop as observed @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear if the interaction of the snr reverse shock could destroy these structures . in this case",
    ", the loops would be formed through another mechanism .",
    "we identified two structures of the snail near the edge of the body referred to as the apex and the bay .",
    "the former could be a protrusion from the body , but it is difficult to confirm because its proximity to the head complicates the interpretation of the morphology .",
    "the magnetic field vectors at the apex show a radial instead of tangential orientation as seen in other parts of the pwn boundary .",
    "similar protrusions and chimney - like structures are seen in the crab nebula @xcite and in kes 75 @xcite .",
    "the apex could be formed by the leakage of pwn materials into the surrounding shocked sn ejecta , similar to the chimney of the crab nebula . however , one difference between the crab nebula and the body of the snail is that the boundary magnetic field of the crab nebula is primarily radial @xcite , and so the physical processes appear to be different",
    ".    the nature of the faint emission outside of the bay , which is outlined by the outermost contour in figure  [ fig : structure ] , could be important for understanding the evolution scenario of g327.1@xmath01.1 .",
    "it has been suggested as part of the pwn @xcite , implying that the true boundary of the pwn should lie outside the bay , such that the head would be pointing closer to the center of the body as suggested by simulations @xcite , instead of being tangential to its edge .      as pointed out in section  [ sec : morph ] , our radio maps revealed two point sources in the northern edge of the pwn .",
    "we found that the eastern one is unpolarized ( figure  [ fig : pm ] ) and has an inverted spectrum of @xmath127 , which differs significantly from the typical value of @xmath128 for pwne .",
    "these points suggest that it is likely an unrelated background source .    on the other hand",
    ", the western source has a spectral index of @xmath129 and is about @xmath96 polarized at 6 and 3 cm .",
    "the polarized emission allows us to determine the rm of the source and its value is consistent with that of the surrounding pwn ( see figure  [ fig : rm ] ) , suggesting a similar distance .",
    "it also spatially coincides with the filaments in the pwn .",
    "therefore , we argue that it is associated with the snail , possibly an unresolved compact knot as part of the filaments .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the highly ordered magnetic field found in the snail could imply a large characteristic scale of the turbulence . to get a handle on the scale in this case",
    ", we consider a toy model of the body of the snail ( i.e.excluding the head ) as a non - evolving spherical nebula .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that we do not expect significant multipolar anisotropy in the pressure exerted by the reverse shock , except for the dipolar component , which will displace the pwn instead of deforming it .",
    "the volume of the nebula is divided into patches of uniform size that represent the characteristic turbulence scale in the pwn .",
    "the turbulent magnetic field is implemented in our model by assigning a magnetic field with random orientation but uniform strength to each of the patches .",
    "we argue that this assumption is justified , as the magnetic field inferred from simulations @xcite is close to the equipartition value we derived in section  [ sec : bfield ] below , and therefore the fluctuations in the magnetic field strength should be small .",
    "otherwise , the fluctuation will rapidly fade away over a timescale of the order of the sound crossing time ( which is much shorter than the age of the system ) .",
    "the electron density is also assumed to be uniform for the same reason , and we assume a power - law distribution with the index given by the measured radio spectrum .",
    "we further allow for the possibility that a patch is filled with cold snr material instead of non - thermal pulsar wind particles .",
    "this mixing of sn ejecta in the snail was suggested based on x - ray observations @xcite and can also be seen in other reverse shock crushed pwne such as vela x @xcite .",
    "the probability that a patch is filled by synchrotron - emitting pulsar wind particles is simply the filling factor in our model .",
    "if there is no significant mixing of materials in the pwn , then the modeling results with a filling factor of @xmath130 should fit the observations best , while a lower filling factor would suggest substantial mixing .",
    "we integrated the synchrotron emission along different lines of sight through the volume of the nebula in all of the stokes parameters to compute the radio maps for comparisons with our observations .",
    "for this , we convolved the simulation results with the radio beam .",
    "note that the randomness introduced by the filling factor and the magnetic field orientations make it possible to exactly reproduce the observations if we run the model for a considerable number of times ( albeit that will be meaningless ) , and therefore it is more sensible to only produce one set of maps per combination of parameters , and then inspect by eye the scales of the structures , the number of features in the pwn , and the contrast in radio intensity instead of looking for a perfect match .",
    "this allows us to place a rough constraint on the filling factor and the characteristic turbulence scale of the snail . the simulated intensity and fluctuation maps",
    "are shown in figures [ fig : mhd1 ] and [ fig : mhd2 ] .",
    "a filling factor of 5075% and a patch size of 1/81/6 of the pwn radius ( @xmath131 ) appear to give the best match between the simulations and the data , such that they have comparable numbers of small - scale features and contrast in the intensity maps . in figure",
    "[ fig : mhd3 ] we show the simulated polarization maps .",
    "a large filling factor or small patch size generally give a lower polarization fraction .",
    "this is because , as there are more patches with different @xmath132-field orientation along a line of sight , depolarization becomes more severe .",
    "we find that the same range of filling factor and patch size as above provide the best fit to the observation .",
    "if this simple model is true , then the simulation results suggest that mixing in this pwn is significant and the turbulence scale is about @xmath133  @xmath134 .",
    "the former conclusion is in line with the speculation of @xcite , and should be taken into account for further theoretical work with the snail .",
    "finally , we note that the randomly oriented magnetic field in this simple model does not satisfy the solenoid condition ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) .",
    "therefore , it fails to reproduce the magnetic loops in the pwn interior and the tangential field structure at the boundary as observed .",
    "instead , it is more useful to compare the coherence scales of the models with the observations .",
    "we determined a spectral index of @xmath75 for the snail between 36 and 6 cm .",
    "such a flat spectrum is typical for pwne .",
    "the flux density at 3 cm is not well determined as the observations are only sensitive to smaller structures in the pwn but not the whole nebula .",
    "the head of the snail has a steeper spectral index of @xmath87 .",
    "this is unexpected , as x - ray observations suggest that the particles are injected from the head ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore the materials in the head should be younger than those of the body .",
    "this means that the spectral difference probably can not be explained by synchrotron cooling .",
    "we also note that this spectral index is considerably steeper than the generally expected value for pwne ( @xmath2 ) , which is rather unusual and requires further theoretical modeling to explain .",
    "we computed the minimum - energy magnetic field strength by imposing the conventional assumption , i.e.  that the total energy @xmath136 is distributed between magnetic energy @xmath137 and particle energy @xmath138 in a way that @xmath136 is minimized . from synchrotron theory @xcite , we have @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the volume filling factor of the magnetic field , @xmath141 is the volume of the emission region , @xmath142 is a constant weakly depending on the spectral index and frequency range considered , @xmath143 is the energy ratio of ions to electrons , and @xmath144 is the synchrotron luminosity of the pwn .",
    "minimizing @xmath136 gives a minimum - energy field , @xmath145^{2/7}{\\rm , } \\label{eqn : beq}\\ ] ] which is also referred to as the `` equipartition field '' in some literature .",
    "we integrated the simple power - law radio spectrum for the entire pwn ( as in the fit of figure  [ fig : radiospec ] ) between @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and found @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the distance to the snail in units of @xmath122 . to estimate the volume @xmath141 , we modeled the body as a sphere of diameter @xmath52 and the head as a cylinder with a diameter of @xmath60 and a length of @xmath59 .",
    "the volume of the pwn is then @xmath150 .",
    "substituting these parameters into equation  [ eqn : beq ] gives @xmath151 assuming @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 , we find a minimum - energy field of @xmath155 in the snail , which is of the same order of magnitude as that estimated by modeling the broadband emission of the pwn ( @xmath156 ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the computed minimum - energy field strength can depend on the frequency range chosen .",
    "for instance , if we only integrate up to @xmath157 instead of @xmath147 , then we obtain a slightly lower value of @xmath158 , and it is much less sensitive to the lower frequency limit .",
    "it is also worth noting that the energy in the pulsar wind is believed to be particle - dominated upon injection , and hence the minimum - energy condition is not guaranteed to hold .",
    "we also computed the minimum - energy field strength of the body and the head separately , using identical procedures as above . for the body",
    ", we have @xmath159 and @xmath160 , which gives @xmath161 . for the head",
    ", we have @xmath162 and @xmath163 , which gives @xmath164 .",
    "the higher minimum - energy field strength in the head as compared to that in the body could suggest that the reverse shock has compressed the former but not yet the latter .      figure  [ fig : g327]b shows that the radio peak of the head is offset from the x - ray point source by @xmath68 ( corresponding to @xmath165 at a distance of @xmath122 ) , which is larger than the astrometric uncertainty of @xmath166 of _ chandra _ and the radio beam size ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "a similar offset is found in other systems , including g319.9@xmath00.7 @xcite and the lighthouse nebula @xcite powered by psr j1101@xmath06101 @xcite , in which the radio and x - ray peaks are displaced by @xmath118 and @xmath168 , respectively . on the other hand , there is no detectable radio emission at the location of the x - ray prongs and arc of the snail .",
    "this is analogous to the x - ray jet - like structures seen in the guitar nebula @xcite and the lighthouse nebula @xcite .",
    "this could be the result of the diffusion of high - energy particles , but the density is too low for the radio emission to be detected .",
    "we also note that the prong structures are aligned with the edge of the radio head .",
    "the broadband synchrotron spectra of pwne often steepen at high frequency due to synchrotron cooling . for a single population of particles injected into the system",
    ", the spectral break frequency @xmath169 and magnetic field strength @xmath132 could be used to estimate the pwn age @xmath170 by @xcite @xmath171 using the @xmath172 obtained through extrapolation of radio and x - ray spectra ( figure  [ fig : radiospec]b ) and the minimum - energy field strength obtained above ( @xmath173 ) gives @xmath174 for the snail .",
    "if we instead use the magnetic field strength estimate from modeling ( @xmath156 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then we acquire an even larger @xmath175 .",
    "these values differ significantly from the age estimates of @xmath176@xmath177 from previous studies @xcite .",
    "we argue that the simple estimate from the spectral break may not reflect the true age of the system .",
    "the change in spectral index by a simple extrapolation of the radio and x - ray spectra is @xmath178 .",
    "this suggests that the actual spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the system can be much more complicated than expected , as the result of a broken power - law injection spectrum and enhanced synchrotron burnoff induced by the reverse shock interaction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this can be verified by future observations between the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "figure  [ fig : radiospec]b shows the broadband sed of the snail from radio to @xmath1-rays , with the @xmath1-ray data from _ fermi _ and h.e.s.s .",
    "while the tev @xmath1-ray spectrum from h.e.s.s . appears to align with the x - ray spectrum , this is probably just coincidence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we presented radio observations of the snail pwn in snr g327.1@xmath01.1 using atca and compared the results with the previous most study @xcite .",
    "the pwn shows the same morphology in all the five bands between 36 and 3 cm , consisting of a main circular body believed to be the `` relic '' pwn and a protruding head .",
    "the 6 and 3 cm polarization maps reveal a highly ordered magnetic field structure , in contrast with the turbulent interior with a tangled magnetic field structure expected for a reverse shock crushed pwn .",
    "this may suggest that the characteristic turbulence scale is larger than the radio beam size . to explore this scenario , we developed a toy model to simulate the emission from a turbulent pwn and found that a characteristic turbulence scale of @xmath179 ",
    "@xmath134 with a filling factor of @xmath180@xmath181 can most closely match the observations .",
    "we showed that the magnetic field at the head of the snail aligns with the nebular elongation .",
    "this serves as a good example of subsonic cometary pwn systems with magnetic field parallel to the tail .",
    "in addition , we discovered filamentary structures in the body which could be magnetic loops .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether they are formed by kink instabilities as suggested for 3c  58 and g54.1@xmath1160.3 , or by turbulence during the reverse shock interaction .",
    "we also determined a spectral index of @xmath75 for the overall pwn in the observed radio bands , which gives a minimum - energy magnetic field strength of @xmath182 .",
