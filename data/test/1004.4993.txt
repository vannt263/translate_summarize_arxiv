    "physics of graphene perception begins when one compares landau levels in two dimensional schrdinger and dirac theories .",
    "such spectacular phenomenon as unconventional quantum hall effect @xcite is caused by the anomaly of the lowest landau level ( lll ) @xcite which for dirac fermions in graphene is field independent and can accommodate only half the usual number of the states from the conduction band and takes the other half from the valence band .",
    "the easiest way to accomplish this peculiar feature of the lll is to solve a pair of the dirac equations that describe excitations near two inequivalent @xmath0 points of graphene s brillouin zone .",
    "normally this is done in a constant homogeneous magnetic field , although this property of the lll for dirac fermions is topologically protected for inhomogeneous field configurations and in the presence of ripples @xcite .",
    "the simplest inhomogeneous field configuration which contains nontrivial aharonov - bohm physics can be created by an infinitesimally thin solenoid . in practice",
    "such magnetic field configuration may be obtained when a type - ii superconductor is placed on top of graphene or semicondunducting heterojunction hosting a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) with quadratic dispersion .",
    "while graphene devices still have to be fabricated , devices like this with a superconducting film grown on top of a semiconducting heterojunction ( such as gaas / algaas ) hosting a 2deg have in fact been fabricated twenty years ago @xcite and theoretically well studied ( see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "theoretically a problem of the dirac fermions in the field of aharonov - bohm flux was encountered in the context of cosmic strings by gerbert and jackiw @xcite .",
    "while for the solutions of the dirac equation with nonzero angular momentum the square integrability requirement specifies which of the two independent solutions should be taken , they noticed this is not the case for the zero angular momentum .",
    "for the zero momentum there is an ambiguity as both solutions are square integrable , but divergent as @xmath1 at the origin , where @xmath2 is the space coordinate .",
    "the ambiguity of the solution selection is caused by the singular nature of the infinitesimally thin solenoid vector potential at the origin .",
    "this problem has initiated a vast theoretical literature which addresses interesting aspects related to the rigorous treatment of the solutions of the dirac equation with the aharonov - bohm potential ( see e.g. refs .   for a review ) . in the condensed matter context the dirac fermions in the field of solenoid emerged during the study of the dirac - bogolyubov - de gennes quasiparticles in the vortex state of @xmath3-wave superconductors",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) . due to",
    "the divergence of the zero mode solutions theory predicts a formation of nonzero local density of states ( ldos ) near the vortex center .",
    "however , this theoretical prediction based on the dirac nature of quasiparticles in @xmath3-wave superconductors does not agree with the results of scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements @xcite in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "finally we mention a related problem of the description of topological defects in graphene based on the dirac equation with a pointlike pseudomagnetic vortex which has also been studied intensively , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the electronic excitations in graphene in the field of the aharonov - bohm flux and compare them with the corresponding results for 2deg with a quadratic dispersion .",
    "we rely on the existing studies of the dirac fermions in the aharonov - bohm potential , but focus on the specific features of graphene such as the presence of two inequivalent @xmath0 points which implies that one should consider the solutions for both inequivalent irreducible representations of the dirac @xmath4 matrices . also to avoid unnecessary formal complications we consider the physical regularization of the problem modeling a finite radius flux tube created by the abrikosov vortex .",
    "we utilize the simplest case of magnetic field concentrated in a thin cylindrical shell of small but finite radius @xmath5 when @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to high - temperature superconductors dirac description of the quasiparticles in graphene is proven valid under the different conditions . in particular , sts measurements of graphene flakes on graphite",
    "@xcite exhibit the structural and electronic properties expected of pristine graphene such as the development of a single sequence of pronounced landau level peaks corresponding to massless dirac fermions in a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we propose to perform sts measurements for graphene penetrated by vortices from a type - ii superconductor , because the dirac theory predicts rather peculiar behavior of ldos not expected for the 2deg with a quadratic dispersion of carriers .",

    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model hamiltonians and discuss the regularization of the aharonov - bohm potential used in this work .",
    "[ sec : schrodinger ] is devoted to the nonrelativistic case , and the relativistic case is discussed in detail in sec .",

    "[ sec : concl ] our final results are summarized .",
    "we consider nonrelativistic and relativistic hamiltonians .",

    "the dirac quasiparticle in graphene is described by the hamiltonian @xmath15 where the matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined in terms of the pauli matrices as @xmath18 here @xmath19 labels two unitary inequivalent representations of @xmath4 gamma matrices , so that one considers a pair of dirac equations corresponding to two inequivalent @xmath20 points of graphene s brillouin zone . in eq .",

    "since this gap and its origin are intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in the last few years , here we consider a generic case with a finite value of @xmath22 .",

    "it should be mentioned that in the case of graphene the components of the spinor @xmath35 are associated with a sublattice rather than a spin degree of freedom .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton - rel ] ) originates from a nonrelativistic many - body theory , the zeeman interaction term has to be explicitly added to this hamiltonian .",
    "this resembles the case of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian ( [ hamilton - nonrel ] ) which becomes pauli one when the interaction between the magnetic moment of the spin and an external magnetic field is added . in the present paper",
    "we do not include the spin degree of freedom neither in ( [ hamilton - nonrel ] ) nor in ( [ hamilton - rel ] ) .",

    "we mention a recent work @xcite , where the effect of the vacuum polarization in the field of an infinitesimally thin solenoid at the distances much larger than the radius of solenoid was studied . constructing the gf the authors neglected the delta - function ( [ discontinuity ] ) motivated by the fact that they are interested in the regime @xmath258 .",
    "one of their interesting conclusions is that for @xmath29 the induced current is zero .",
    "the main motivation of this work was to address a natural question whether one can distinguish graphene from 2deg measuring the ldos near the abrikosov vortex penetrating them . just by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:4 ] we find a positive answer . indeed , by putting the stm tip close to the vortex , for example , at the distance , @xmath259 , where @xmath122 is the lattice constant , we observe that in 2deg the value of the ldos will be close to its background value @xmath260 in the free system , while in undoped graphene one should observe a strong ldos enhancement near the fermi level . or to be more precise , if there is no gap @xmath22 in the quasiparticle spectrum , the peak of the ldos should be observed at the fermi level , or if @xmath261 the peaks should be observed at the energies @xmath262 and the sign of the peak energy should depend on the sublattice .",
    "this peaked behavior of the ldos with @xmath244 for @xmath114 reflects the specific feature of the dirac fermions such as the presence of the divergent as @xmath1 at the origin zero mode solution of the dirac equation .",
    "thus the observation of this feature in sts measurements would contribute to the expanding list of the experimental manifestations of the dirac fermions in graphene .",
    "our second conclusion is that while in the nonrelativistic case the presence of the aharonov - bohm vortex leads to a depletion of the full dos , in the dirac case the full dos is enhanced .",
    "this result can likely be checked by analyzing the sts maps .",
    "we remind at the end that in this paper we did not consider the effect of disorder in the presence of magnetic field which will definitely affect the behavior of the ldos in magnetic field @xcite and should be taken into account in the analysis of the sts data .",
