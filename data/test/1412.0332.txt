    "the physical mechanism of the dependence of nonclassical correlations on the relative phase @xmath176 is that quantum interference has been induced by the dipole - dipole coupling @xmath99 between qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the dynamical evolution process , which can be easily checked that the influence of @xmath176 can be simply removed by setting @xmath94 in eq .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the dynamics of tdd for special @xmath0 states . by considering a dephasing two - qubit system initially prepared in a class of @xmath0 states with maximally mixed marginals",
    ", we find the necessary condition for the occurrence of freezing discord and compare it with that of entropic discord .",
    "it is shown that the condition of freezing tdd is much weaker than that of freezing entropic discord .",
    "moreover , we employ a concrete model consisting of two interacting qubits coupled to independent reservoirs to illustrate these dynamical properties of tdd . it is further found that the phenomena of freezing tdd exist even when the effect of dipole - dipole coupling between the two qubits is included , in which case the evolution state does not possess maximally mixed marginals . by increasing the dipole - dipole coupling @xmath99 , the duration of freezing discord is prolonged in the sudden transition process while it is shortened in the double sudden changes process .",
    "the differences between discord and entanglement are also analyzed by considering another class of @xmath0 states , i.e. , the ewl states .",
