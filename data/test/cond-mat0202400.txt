    "long - range forces , namely gravitation and electromagnetic interactions , are difficult to treat exactly in many - particle systems . in condensed matter , biological and solid state physics , there is considerable interest in the simulation of charged and polar molecules embedded in a slab in which the particles are replicated periodically in two directions .",
    "the applications range widely to include soap bubbles , cell membranes and electrochemistry .",
    "surprisingly ewald and other rapidly convergent methods for computing long - range interactions in infinitely periodic systems are computationally more demanding when the system is periodic in only one or two of the three spatial dimensions because of the breaking of spatial symmetry .",
    "several `` two - dimensional ewald '' ( * ew2d * ) methods have already been proposed@xcite .",
    "the most successful is that introduced by parry@xcite and others@xcite .",
    "this method can be used to obtain accurate results but is limited to small systems ( i.e. @xmath1 to @xmath2 charges ) .",
    "this springs from the fact that the pair separations , @xmath3 , are no longer separable in the fourier summation because of the necessary decoupling of the aperiodic @xmath4 component from the periodic @xmath5 and @xmath6 components .",
    "therefore it appears that the complexity ( scaling of time with number of charges ) of this method can be no better than quadratic .",
    "also the one dimensional ewald method@xcite suffers from the same problem .",
    "a promising alternative to ewald summation is possible using a convergence - factor technique@xcite .",
    "the basic coulomb pair interaction is multiplied by one with the factor @xmath7 .",
    "it is crucial to prove that the limit can be taken outside of the summation and now the modified potential is more readily susceptible to analysis . in a recent study,@xcite arnold and holm",
    "derive a two - dimensional version of this method with complexity @xmath8 along with accurate error formulas .",
    "this method is particularly attractive when extremely high accuracy is desired .",
    "we will use this method , abbreviated as * mmm2d * and the * ew2d * algorithm mentioned above as reference methods .",
    "one idea , used several times to study water interfaces , introduces a spatial constraint within the simulation cell .",
    "if the box has dimensions @xmath9 , the particles may have @xmath4-coordinates on @xmath10 , while the space within @xmath11 ( the gap size ) remains empty @xcite .",
    "the primary cell is , as usual , replicated in all three directions periodically .",
    "the effect of this is to create a `` primary layer '' and an empty layer followed by an infinite array of intercalated image and empty layers .",
    "figure [ periodicity ] summarizes the essential geometrical considerations in this problem .",
    "while this idea seems trivially to be correct , it has one flaw .",
    "the flaw can be realized by attempting to reproduce the results of an * ew2d * calculation using a three dimensional ewald summation ( * ew3d * ) as just described .",
    "one will find that the results always differ by a dipole - moment dependent constant .",
    "this fact , although at first thought to be merely a slow convergence issue , was noticed by spohr @xcite . the * ew3d * formula contains a shape dependent dipole - term whose origin was mathematically proven in the 1980 s @xcite , that reflects the naturally chosen spherical order of summation in the conditionally convergent coulomb sum . for the case of layers , however , it is necessary to use a _ slab - wise summation order_. this was realized by yeh and berkowitz@xcite , who applied a theory due to e. r. smith @xcite for infinite crystals of various shapes in order to obtain the correct dipole term for a slab - wise summation order .",
    "another complication arises , if the periodic supersystem is surrounded by some medium with a different dielectric constant .",
    "this medium has a polarizing effect on the particles in the simulation cell no matter how large the supersystem is .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we consider only the simple case of zero contrast for which the dielectric constant is the same inside and outside the supersytem .",
    "this is often referred to as the vacuum boundary condition .",
    "one of the advantages of using this method from a practical point of view is that any standard ewald program may be used with only minor modification .",
    "it is easy to show numerically that the use of this new dipole term and sufficient spacing ( @xmath12 ) , yields the same result as two - dimensional `` brute force '' , * mmm2d * and * ew2d * summation methods .",
    "as explained in a previous paper , referred to here as `` paper i''@xcite , errors introduced due to the image layer effects decay exponentially with the size of the gap .",
    "this method is sometimes referred to as a corrected three - dimensional ewald sum ( * ew3dc*)@xcite . like the original ewald method it has a complexity of @xmath13 and the equations can be discretized onto a mesh yielding an @xmath14 complexity . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we derived an analytic electrostatic layer correction term , called * elc*-term , that subtracts the interactions of the unwanted slab replicas .",
    "this term can be evaluated linearly in @xmath15 , and has full error control .",
    "the use of the * elc * term and the change of summation order , shortly called the * elc * method , enables us to adapt any 3d summation method , such as the non - ewald convergence - factor@xcite and multipole expansion@xcite methods , to slab geometries .",
    "the latter of these , though in possession of a slightly better scaling , has such a considerable amount of overhead that it is useful only for much larger systems than normally used@xcite .",
    "the abbreviations and complexities of some of the two - dimensional methods available at present are summarized in table [ tab1 ] , where the ending lc always denotes the use of the * elc * method . in this terminology",
    "the * ew3d * algorithm plus the * elc * method is called * ew3dlc * and so on .",
    ".methods for slab geometry . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    the results of this analysis are displayed in table [ tab2 ] . under these conditions ,",
    "the * ew3dlc * method is only slightly ( 30% ) faster .",
    "the reason is that much of the work in these calculations is performed in the real - space and therefore the extra amount of reciprocal - space required by * ew3dc * due to the enlarged gap is not a major issue .",
    "in fact it is almost compensated by the time used by layer correction term . for larger @xmath15 , * ew3dlc * should become faster than * ew3dc * since the reciprocal - space time becomes much longer than the layer correction time .",
    "the same is true about higher accuracy conditions as is observable from the analytical error estimates ( eqs .",
    "[ real_error]-[fourier_error ] ) .",
    "moreover , in a mesh implementation , the same comparison should yield a more substantial advantage to the layer correction since more of the computational effort is expended in reciprocal space .",
    "we have presented and tested a method with broad applicability and low computational cost for computing the electrostatic forces or energy of a cell of charges with two - dimensional periodicity .",
    "this method has a complexity that is virtually linear when applied to a mesh , so that only minor further improvements in computation time can be attempted through a reduction of computational overhead .",
    "the algorithm differs from * ew3dc * only by the effort to program the * elc*-term , but once this is done the errors are easier to control and there is a greater degree of freedom in choosing the box edges .",
    "this makes it easy to apply to cubic versions of the * p3 m * algorithm ( which was one of our initial motivations ) . for larger systems and better accuracy",
    "as may be required in monte carlo and some molecular dynamics simulations the method should be considerably faster than * ew3dc*.    it is interesting to estimate the largest system tractable with modern computing .",
    "the * p3 m * algorithm can be optimized to be at least twice as fast as the version presented here , so an @xmath16 calculation could be carried out in approximately . 2 seconds .",
    "a 100-node parallel computer with a 90% scale factor could handle a system of 0.45 million particles in 1 second  which is sufficient for a many molecular dynamics and monte carlo simulations",
    ".    finally we can draw attention to several issues suitable for further research .",
    "most importantly we have not treated the case of dissimilar dielectric materials at the slab surfaces .",
    "because of the symmetry of the consequent charge reflections there could be a way to handle the problem efficiently within the current framework .",
    "another topic is the clarification of the dipole term for slab - wise summation for different dielectric constants at the interface between the periodic supersystem and the surroundings .",
    "the authors thank zuowei wang and florian mller - plathe for helpful discussions .",
    "financial support from the dfg `` schwerpunkt polyelektrolyte '' is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "for quick reference the force and pressure formulas for the layer correction are given here .",
    "the layer correction force on particle @xmath17 is @xmath18 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sum_{j}q_{i}q_{j}\\bigl[\\;2\\sum_{k_{x},k_{y}>0}\\frac{k_{y}\\cosh ( k_{\\parallel } z_{ij})}{k_{\\parallel } ( e^{k_{\\parallel } l_{z}}-1)}\\cos ( k_{x}x_{ij})\\sin ( k_{y}y_{ij})+   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sum_{k_{y}>0}\\frac{\\cosh ( k_{y}z_{ij})}{(e^{k_{y}l_{z}}-1)}\\sin ( k_{y}y_{ij})\\bigr ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sum_{j}q_{i}q_{j}\\bigl[\\;2\\sum_{k_{x},k_{y}>0}\\frac{\\sinh ( k_{\\parallel } z_{ij})}{(e^{k_{\\parallel } l_{z}}-1)}\\cos ( k_{x}x_{ij})\\cos ( k_{y}y_{ij})+   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sum_{k_{x}>0}\\frac{\\sinh ( k_{x}z_{ij})}{(e^{k_{x}l_{z}}-1)}\\cos ( k_{x}x_{ij})+\\sum_{k_{y}>0}\\frac{\\sinh ( k_{y}z_{ij})}{(e^{k_{y}l_{z}}-1)}\\cos ( k_{y}y_{ij})\\bigr]\\biggr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the diagonal components of the pressure tensor can be obtained from the partition function .",
    "for example the normal component is @xmath19 .",
    "this yields @xmath20 where @xmath21 for one of the parallel components we find @xmath22 \\cos ( k_{x}x_{ij})\\cos ( k_{y}y_{ij})+   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\sum_{k_{x}>0 } & & \\nu ( k_{x})\\cos ( k_{x}x_{ij})+   \\nonumber \\\\ \\sum_{k_{y}>0 } & & \\frac{1}{k_{y}l_{z}}\\frac{\\cosh ( k_{y}z_{ij})}{(e^{k_{y}l_{z}}-1)}\\cos ( k_{y}y_{ij})\\biggr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously this is cumbersome since after decomposing the trigonometric and hyperbolic terms to obtain a formula that can be evaluated linearly in @xmath15 the expanded version will contain over 80 terms .",
    "if rapid pressure calculations are not demanded one can omit this term and increase @xmath23 .",
    "one third of the trace of this tensor will as usual yield the scalar pressure , @xmath24 .",
    "another consideration in obtaining the pressures is the treatment of the dipole term .",
    "fortunately , a shear or distortion on the system does not result in a distortion in the shape of the supersystem .",
    "this is in contrast to the treatment of standard ewald summation because the spherical summation order requires a complex analysis of the consequences of a distorted sphere.@xcite                                              the summation order of the layer correction is implicitely cylindrical .",
    "it probably does not matter whether the summation procedes along the radius of the cylinder first and then along its axis ( as written ) or vice versa .",
    "but they may not proceed simultaneously ."
