    "cosmic strings formed during a cosmological phase transition at an energy scale of about @xmath1 gev are sufficiently massive to seed structure formation .",
    "however , calculations of the gravitational effects from strings are hampered by uncertainty over the statistics of the evolving network @xcite .    from lattice simulations of string formation @xcite ,",
    "a picture has developed of a string network at formation consisting of a scale - invariant distribution of closed loops together with a percentage of infinite brownian strings crossing the universe .",
    "the subsequent evolution would consist of the growth of the step length of the brownian infinite string network as the strings attempt to straighten out , and energy loss via loop production during reconnection .",
    "early analytic work identified the key property of _ scaling _ where at least the gross properties of the network can be characterised by a length scale , roughly the persistence length or the interstring distance @xmath2 , which grows with the horizon @xcite .",
    "this result was supported by subsequent numerical work @xcite . however , further investigation revealed dynamical processes , including loop production , at scales much smaller than @xmath2 @xcite . in response ,",
    "austin _ et al _ developed a model describing the network in terms of three scales @xcite ( hereafter ack ) .",
    "these scales are : the usual energy density scale @xmath2 , a correlation length @xmath3 along the string and a scale @xmath4 relating to local structure on the string .",
    "it seemed likely from the ack model that @xmath2 and @xmath3 would scale with @xmath4 growing slowly , if at all , until gravitational radiation effects became important when @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "progress has also been made using alternative analytical approaches in @xcite .",
    "understanding how the network scales is important because it simplifies the process of building a model representing the evolving network .",
    "predictions of the power in the anisotropies in the microwave background require the two - time correlation functions for various components of the string energy - momentum tensor evolving over @xmath6 expansion times .",
    "as present simulations can not achieve this range , constructing a model is necessary .",
    "we presented a simple model of the two - time correlation functions in a non - expanding background in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a numerical study of evolving strings in a minkowski space - time .",
    "we demonstrate the scaling behaviour of correlation functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 vectors ( dynamical quantities which are linear combinations of tangent and velocity vectors ) along the string .",
    "these functions may be used to complement analytical studies @xcite and also in existing formalism to predict small - scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background @xmath9 .",
    "the largest length scale associated with these correlations , @xmath3 , and the interstring distance @xmath2 are both significantly smaller than the causal horizon which suggests that the effects of the expanding background on the correlation functions are small . following coulson _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we think of the minkowski network of strings as modelling more realistic strings , by mapping minkowski time to conformal time and minkowski space to comoving coordinates .    as a test for the ack model , we examine the rate equations for the evolving length scales developed in ack as they apply to a minkowski space - time with no gravitational radiation , and compare the results with our simulations .",
    "such a comparison is problematic because there are a number of parameters which are difficult to calculate directly . in particular ,",
    "the parameter @xmath10 which controls the behaviour of @xmath4 is hard to measure .",
    "we have showed good quantitative agreement between the ack model and our simulations for the approach to scaling of @xmath2 , and qualitative agreement for @xmath4 .",
    "a major problem is understanding the relationship between small - scale structure along the string and loop production .",
    "bennett and bouchet @xcite provide evidence that strings possess a fractal substructure arising from kink production during reconnection .",
    "this `` intermediate '' fractal , constant at fixed time , spreads over a larger range of scales as the network evolves and by the end of the simulation covers a range between the resolution scale and the persistence length @xmath3 .",
    "most of the loop production occurs at scales near the resolution scale .",
    "shellard and allen @xcite also observe loop production near the scale of resolution and an `` intermediate '' fractal in the long string , although they attribute the fractal to the effect of initial conditions and a restrictive dynamical range .",
    "the build up of small - scale structure is allowed by the austin _ et al _ analysis : their original guesses for the model parameters yield the increase in small - scale structure observed in the expanding universe codes .",
    "however , it is not well known that their model can also predict that the small - scale structure ( as measured by @xmath4 ) is absent .",
    "indeed , we find that if there are no restrictions on loop production , then small - scale structure will disappear : all three length scales defined in ack will have the same magnitude .",
    "we also find that the region of constant fractal dimension , which we observe if we artificially constrain loop production , disappears .",
    "this has interesting implications for the energy loss mechanism from cosmic strings .",
    "the standard scenario is that any build up of small - scale structure will only be checked by the back reaction from the string s own gravitational field , which only becomes effective when @xmath11 is small ( of order @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "loop production will then grow with the horizon , albeit at a scale much smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "although much smaller than @xmath2 , these loops are vastly bigger than the string width and will be topologically stable , losing energy through gravitational radiation .",
    "if there is no small - scale ( as measured by @xmath4 ) and loop production occurs at the smallest possible scale - presumably the string width - then energy loss will be dominated by production of gut quanta @xcite .",
    "furthermore , particle production from cuspy regions may occur _ without _ any conventional loop production at all .",
    "this will obviously allow the string scenario to avoid any gravity wave bounds @xcite , but the implications for the decay products of the string quanta are less clear .",
    "recent calculations of the flux of high energy decay products from string quanta have been compared with observed fluxes to put an upper bound on the proportion of string energy going into particles @xcite . in the standard scenario",
    "these bounds can be avoided @xcite . however ,",
    "if energy loss is dominated by particle production such bounds will constrain the gut physics if the gut scale string scenario is to survive .",
    "in minkowski space the string equations of motion are @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is time and @xmath17 is a space - like parameter along the string .",
    "the spatially flat frw metric is conformal to the minkowski metric and we regard the minkowski time as conformal time , in the limit that the expansion of the universe goes to zero .",
    "@xmath18 is a position three - vector which satisfies the constraints @xmath19 @xmath20 the first constraint ensures no tangential velocities , and ( [ gaugecond2 ] ) ensures that the energy of a segment of string is proportional to its length when measured in units of @xmath21 .    using a development of a code written by one of us previously @xcite , we solve the wave eq .",
    "( [ waveequation ] ) with the smith - vilenkin algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm uses the exact finite difference solution to ( [ waveequation ] ) , @xmath22 if the string points are initially defined on the sites of a cubic lattice @xmath23 , then ( [ smithvil ] ) ensures that they remain on the lattice at time steps of @xmath24 .",
    "the discretised gauge conditions require that for these initial conditions , string links are restricted to three types : stationary ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) , diagonal ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) and cusps ( @xmath29,@xmath30 ) .    because the string points lie on the sites of the lattice , identifying crossing events",
    "is simple .",
    "when two strings cross , they intercommute with a probability which is set to @xmath31 . for most of this",
    "work we set @xmath32 , subject to the condition that reconnection does not create a loop smaller than the threshold @xmath0",
    ". loops with energy greater than or equal to a threshold value of @xmath0 are allowed to leave the network , while reconnections are forbidden for loops with energy equal to @xmath0 .",
    "forbidding reconnections allows energy to leave the network fairly efficiently ; otherwise it takes much longer for the effect of the initial conditions to wear off .",
    "this feature may also model more realistic networks as , in an frw universe , small loops will decouple from the expansion and are highly unlikely to reconnect .",
    "an interesting value for @xmath0 is the minimum segment length @xmath33 .",
    "the loops produced in this case are `` cusps '' : confined to one lattice site and travelling at the speed of light .",
    "the cutoff then becomes a lattice cutoff .",
    "the ability to alter @xmath0 allows us a certain amount of control over small - scale structure and related quantities .",
    "for example , as @xmath0 is increased from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , the rms velocity of a segment along the string increases from @xmath35 ( very close to the matter era value in bennett and bouchet ) to @xmath36 ( close to the radiation era value ) .",
    "this corresponds to a build up of fast - moving small - scale structure .",
    "initial string configurations are generated using the vachaspati - vilenkin algorithm @xcite , which mimics the breaking of a @xmath37 symmetry during a cosmological phase transition . in this approach ,",
    "phases from the minimally discretised @xmath37 group are placed randomly on the sites of a cubic lattice .",
    "strings ( or anti - strings ) are identified as passing through a face with a net winding about the manifold .",
    "the strings are then joined up within the lattice cells to from a network ( any ambiguity if two strings leave and two strings enter a lattice cell is settled randomly ) . the domains , and consequently the initial network step size @xmath38 , are of constant size .",
    "this initial configuration is defined on a cubic lattice with fundamental lattice spacing @xmath24 .",
    "we can alter the initial correlation length @xmath38 in terms of @xmath24 .",
    "if each initial segment length is made up of a large number of individual stationary string links , peculiarities arise in the scaling solution as entire segments can be annihilated into loops of energy @xmath0 moving at the speed of light .",
    "consequently we add structure in the form of cusps to break up long straight segments .",
    "cusps are string links confined to one lattice site which move at the speed of light .",

    "an ensemble typically consists of 30 - 50 runs .",

    "( the discrepancy at larger scales may be due in part to model function underestimating the @xmath175 correlations at large @xmath2 , as the gaussian form of @xmath62 breaks down . )",
    "however , for small scales the agreement is good and this indicates a genuine lack of small - scale structure .",
    "we have demonstrated the scaling behaviour of correlation functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 vectors , which are essential in analytic studies of string networks .    the parameters of model functions for the @xmath176 and @xmath177 correlation functions @xmath75 and @xmath62 ,",
    "depend on how much small - scale structure in present on the string , which is related to the value of the minimum allowed loop energy @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , small - scale structure is allowed to build up and the scaling density can increase by a factor of two more .",
    "we analysed our simulations in terms of the three - scale model proposed by austin _",
    "et al _ , suitably simplified for minkowski space with no gravitational radiation .",
    "the model for @xmath2 describes well the approach to scaling and predicts the two exponents for this approach that we measure in our simulations .",
    "the model for the `` small '' scale @xmath4 is qualitatively consistent with our simulations with critical value @xmath10 determining whether or not @xmath4 will scale .    for the smallest possible value of @xmath0 , small - scale structure disappears , as all the scales @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the 3-scale model of ack",
    "have the same order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , from the fractal analysis along the string for @xmath59 , the transient fractal region disappears , leaving a smooth transition from straight strings on small - scales to the random walk on large scales .",
    "thus the intermediate fractal region seen in the expanding universe codes seems to be an effect of the limit on the size of loops .    in all cases ,",
    "loops are predominantly produced at the smallest possible scale @xmath0 , even when it is set , by the underlying lattice , to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in common with all other simulations ( apart from those of albrecht and turok @xcite ) , there is no evidence for scaling in loop production .",
    "it is therefore time to ask the question : is this the true physical situation ?",
    "it is certainly possible that loops are produced with the smallest possible physical scale , which is the string width , and we see from our simulations that every other measure of the network has a single scale of order @xmath2 .",
    "thus there is no real conflict with the string scaling hypothesis .",
    "one objection to the use of the smith - vilenkin algorithm is its restrictive set of possible values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the initial conditions ( although the subsequent evolution is exact ) . as discussed by albrecht @xcite",
    ", this may exaggerate small loop production .",
    "however , expanding universe codes have no such restrictions and there is no published evidence that loop production happens at any scale other than the loop size cut - off .",
    "furthermore , we have found no evidence that the lattice scale enters the scaling solution . if there is spurious cusp production ( for @xmath59 ) through a chance configuration of @xmath7 and @xmath8 vectors such that eq .",
    "( [ looprodcond ] ) is true , then one would not expect a stable scaling solution .",
    "albrecht suggests that there may also be spurious loop production through `` back - tracking '' @xcite which occurs when individual discretised links or groups of links point in a direction opposite to that of the whole segment of length @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", one would expect the lattice scale @xmath24 to affect the evolution : for example , the rate of energy loss from back - tracking would most likely increase with @xmath178 as the chances for a given link or group of links to back - track in a time @xmath2 increases .",
    "we are confident that our simulations _ do _ approach ( and for large simulations reach ) a stable scaling solution , and from table [ tab : scalx ] we see that the value of the scaling parameter @xmath103 is independent of the range of @xmath2 over which the simulation is run .",
    "we infer from this that the spurious processes mentioned above do not critically enter the observed dynamics .",
    "the prospect that the loops are produced with such tiny sizes is a radical one .",
    "it means that the dominant mode of energy loss of a cosmic string network is particle production and not gravitational radiation as the loops collapse almost immediately .",
    "indeed , it may not be possible to talk about loop production at all : the loop production we observe favours loops formed at cusps , which could annihilate into particles before the loop is formed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gravitational radiation directly from a network without a small scale @xmath179 is negligible .",
    "recent calculations @xcite on the possible role of gut quanta decaying into high energy cosmic rays assumes that particle production is _",
    "sub_dominant to gravitational radiation as a means of energy loss , and conclude that gut strings could not be an appreciable source of cosmic rays . in our suggested energy loss scenario , we may come up against an observational bound of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "simple models of gut quanta decay processes give the upper bound for the proportion of the string energy going into high energy cosmic rays as @xmath180 or less @xcite .",
    "such calculations may put a significant constraint on gut models if the gut scale string scenario is to be viable .",
