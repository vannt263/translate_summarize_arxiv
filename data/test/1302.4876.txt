    "observations with _ swift _ misison has greatly improved our understanding on the nature of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon . the rapid slewing capacity of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard _ swift _ makes it possible to catch x - ray emission from very early to late epochs of grbs . a large sample of grb",
    "x - ray lightcurves have been collected in the time window from tens of seconds to days or even months post the burst alert telescope ( bat ) triggers .",
    "a canonical x - ray lightcurve with five components was revealed from the sample ( zhang et al .",

    "x - ray flares are observed for about half of the @xmath7 grbs ( burrows et al . 2005 ; falcone et al . 2007 ; chincarini et al .",
    "most flares happened at @xmath8 seconds and a small fraction of flares occurred at @xmath9 seconds post the grb trigger time ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "no significant flare after the prompt gamma - ray phase was detected for about 1/3 of these grbs , but bright x - ray flares were detected for the other 2/3 of grbs ( qin et al .",
    "joint spectral analyses for the prompt gamma - ray emission and early x - ray flares indicate that x - ray flares are the low - energy extension of the prompt gamma - ray emission ( peng et al .",
    "significant flares that dominate late x - ray emission ( without the detection of the afterglow emission up to @xmath9 seconds ) were observed in some grbs , such as grbs 050502b , 050724 , 050904 , and 060223 .",
    "the most prominent one is grb 050904 ( cusumano et al .",
    "2007 ) , which was suggested as a super - long grb ( zou et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that these x - ray flares are due to extended central engine activity at late times ( burrows et al .",

    "grb 121027a has a redshift 1.773 ( levan et al . 2012 ) . we downloaded the bat and xrt data from the _ swift _ archive , and extracted the lightcurves and spectra in the bat and xrt bands .",

    "the peak of the 2nd flare was not detected because of the orbit constraint .",
    "the maxi / gsc nova alert system triggered on a bright un - catalogued x - ray transient source with 4 - 10 kev flux about 150 mcrab at @xmath29 seocnds , and the transient was identified as the x - ray emission from grb 121027a ( serino et al .",
    "we correct the flux to the 0.3 - 10 kev energy band and also show it in fig .",
    "1 . the third flare peaks around @xmath30 seconds .",
    "the flux from @xmath31 to @xmath32 seconds almost keeps constant , which maybe due to superposition of the tail of the second flare and the rising segment of the third flare .",
    "we make an empirical fit to the three flares with three broken power - law components , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one can observe that the peak luminosities of the three flares do not show a clear evolution pattern .",

    "xrt detected the corresponding x - rays of prompt emission from @xmath38 to @xmath39 seconds in the slewing mode .",

    ", we fix the host galaxy absorption to @xmath46 @xmath44 , which is derived from fitting the late time spectrum between @xmath47 and @xmath48 s. we find that although a single power - law model can present acceptable fits for the time - resolved spectra during the flares , a cut - off power - law model significantly improves the spectral fits for some time intervals of the flares .",

    "3(a ) , we plot grb 121027a in the @xmath60 diagram and find that it well follows the empirical amati - relation .",
    "we then test if the flares at @xmath61 seconds are also consistent with this relation .",
    "we calculate the x - ray fluence in the 0.3 - 10 kev by integrating the x - ray flux over three flares with the spectral parameters derived above .",
    "we obtain an x - ray fluence @xmath62 erg @xmath44 , which corresponds to an isotropic x - ray energy @xmath63 erg .",
    "note that we do not correct the x - ray energy to the @xmath16 kev band , since the 0.3 - 10 kev band spectrum can be well fit with a cutoff power - law , so that fluence above @xmath2 is negligible .",
    "we can see that the total energy of the flares is about one order of magnitude larger than the gamma - ray energy , but @xmath11 values of the x - ray flares are much lower than those of gamma - rays . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the flares significantly deviate from the amati - relation . next , with a time - resolved spectral analysis , we plot @xmath64 as a function of @xmath11 in fig .",
    "it is interesting to see that the time - resolved @xmath64 and @xmath11 are consistent with the @xmath65 correlation for long grbs ( yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ; liang et al .",
    "these results suggest that the radiation mechanism of prompt gamma - rays and late x - rays is likely the same , even though the luminosity and energetics are noticeably different .",
    "after the flare phase , a long - lasting x - ray plateau was observed during @xmath66 .",
    "this is likely the emission from the external forward shock , which is constantly refreshed by the new ejected materials that power the x - ray flares .",
    "the end of the plateau marks the end of this energy injection , which is defined by the lower limit of the lorentz factor of the late ejecta",
    ". this can be estimated by ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath67^{3/8},\\ ] ] which gives @xmath68 for grb 121027a .",
    "this minimum lorentz factor , even though violates the @xmath69 correlation ( liang et al .",

    "the fact that x - ray flares follow the same @xmath65 and @xmath5 relations as prompt emission suggest that the radiation mechanism of x - ray flares and prompt gamma - ray emission is similar .",
    "the difference is that the more powerful prompt emission has a higher lorentz factor than x - ray flares .",
    "the radiation mechanism of prompt emission is not clear . in the literature ,",
    "competing models include synchrotron radiation",
    "( mszros et al . 1994 ; lloyd & petrosian 2000 ; zhang & yan 2011 ) and quasi - thermal emission from the fireball photosphere ( e.g. thompson 1994 ; rees & mszros 2005 ; beloborodov 2010 ; lazzati & begelman 2010 ) .",
    "at a low accretion rate that is relevant to x - ray flares , the neutrino - anti - neutrino annihilation mechanism would not be adequate to power x - ray flares , and magnetic dissipation is favored ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2005 ) . as a result ,",
    "synchrotron emission from a magnetized jet may be the common mechanism to power both prompt emission and x - ray flares .",
    "long grbs are widely believed to be associated with the deaths of massive stars ( colgate 1974 ; woosley 1993 ) .",
    "the associations of some grbs with type ic supernovae ( woosely & bloom 2006 ) favor a small - size progenitor star , likely a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star with striped hydrogen and helium envelopes .",
    "a successful jet is possible only when the accretion time scale is longer than the time scale for the jet to penetrate through the stellar envelope ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; waxman & mszros 2003 ; bromberg et al .",
    "2012 ) . as a result ,",
    "collapsar - related grbs are typically `` long '' . on the other hand",
    ", a long duration does not necessarily refer to a large progenitor , since various mechanisms ( e.g. fragmentation or magnetic barrier , king et al .",
    "2005 ; perna et al .",
    "2006 ; proga & zhang 2006 ; liu et al .",
    "2012 ) can halt accretion temporarily and extend the total duration of accretion .",
    "indeed , when x - ray flares are included , the central engine activity time of many grbs can be much longer than the duration of gamma - ray emission itself ( e.g. burrows et al . 2005 ; qin et al .",
    "grb 120727a presents an extreme case of such a long - lasting central engine activity : not only the x - ray flaring activity extends to a much later time , but the total energetics of the flares is one order of magnitude higher than that of prompt emission .",
    "this demands that a significant amount of mass is accreted to the black hole in a later epoch . to reserve a large mass reservoir at later times",
    ", one would demand a large progenitor star than wrs .",
    "since an un - mixed star would have an onion structure and would not store a large mass in the outer layer , this burst would also favor a progenitor star with a mixed envelope ( woosley & heger 2006 ) , as expected for a low - metallicity , rapidly - rotating star .",
    "accretion of such a mixed envelope tends to be smooth ( kumar et al .",
    "2008 ; perna & macfadyen 2010 ) , but fragmentation or magnetic barrier ( perna et al .",
    "2006 ; proga & zhang 2006 ; liu et al .",
    "2012 ) can modulate the accretion rate to power flares . indeed a detailed fall - back model ( wu et al .",
    "2013 ) can interpret the x - ray lightcurve of this burst well .",
    "we search for similar grbs from the _ swift _ grb archive .",
    "we find that the late xrt lightcurves of some grbs are dominated by flares without the detection of power - law afterglow component up to @xmath9 .",
    "these include grbs 050502b , 050724 , 050904 , 050916 , and 060223 .",
    "the most prominent one is grb 050904 ( cusumano et al .",

    "this is roughly consistent with the expectation of the standard external shock model in the slow cooling regime for the wind medium case .",
