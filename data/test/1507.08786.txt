    "filaments are ubiquitous structures present in both low- and in high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they were recognised more than 30 years ago @xcite but only recently the _ herschel _ space observatory has shown the omnipresence of the filamentary structures throughout star - forming regions and their strict association with the dense cores from which new stars will form ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "herschel _ results have focused special attention on the formation mechanism of filaments , and in understanding their role in the star formation process , with several studies either analysing interesting filaments , or adopting a more statistical approach .",
    "these studies , although far from answering the key questions , have started to reveal important properties .",
    "for example , filaments in molecular clouds are characterised by having a narrow distribution of widths , with a median value of 0.10@xmath40.03 pc @xcite .",
    "this corresponds , within a factor of 2 , to the sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffuse gas .",
    "this similarity in scale supports the argument that filaments may form as a result of the dissipation of large - scale turbulence .",
    "lower column density filaments are thermally subcritical and gravitationally unbound , and are probably confined by external pressure , while higher column density filaments are thermally supercritical and gravitationally bound and show evidences of gravitational collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a kinematical study conducted on the b211/213 filament in taurus @xcite , revealed that some filaments are actually composed of several distinct , coherent velocity components of gas . in the more massive filaments ,",
    "spectral observations indicate a more dynamical condition of the gas , revealing velocity gradients indicative of collapse and contraction ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lupus complex is an interesting region in which to study filaments .",
    "it is one of the nearest low - mass star - forming regions ( distance between 150 pc and 200 pc , @xcite ) and a few long and well defined filaments have been identified in it ( @xcite : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the complex is located in the scorpius ",
    "centaurus ob association , whose massive stars are likely to have played a significant role in shaping the diffuse material and in the general evolution of the complex .    in this paper , we present an analysis of filaments extracted from the column density maps of the lupus 1 , 3 , and 4 star - forming regions , produced from the photometric observations carried out with the _ herschel _ satellite . in sect .",
    "2 we describe the observations and the data reduction .",
    "the analysis of the filament properties and of the probability distribution function is presented in sect . 3 ad 4 , respectively .",
    "the results are discussed in sect . 5 and",
    "the main conclusions are reported in sect .",
    "as part of the _ herschel _ gould belt survey ( hgbs ; @xcite ) the three subregions of the lupus complex , lupus 1 , 3 , and 4 , have been observed in five photometric bands between 70 @xmath5 m and 500 @xmath5 m with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) and the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; @xcite ) on - board the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out in the parallel observing mode with a scanning velocity of 60 arcsec / sec and each zone was observed twice with orthogonal scanning directions .",
    "the spatial resolution in this observing mode is 7.6 at 70 @xmath5 m , 11.5 at 160 @xmath5 m , 182 at 250@xmath5 m , 249 at 350 @xmath5 m and 363 at 500 @xmath5 m .",
    "a first version of the lupus maps was published by @xcite who used the romagal pipeline @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a new reduction of the maps obtained with a different pipeline and updated calibration files .",
    "the pipeline for the production of the pacs maps ( at 70 @xmath5 m and 160 @xmath5 m ) consisted of the following steps : the level 1 data products were generated with standard product generation ( spg ) version 10 within the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe ) ; level 1 data were arranged in time ordered data ( tod ) and exported in fits format ; the tods of the two orthogonal observations were ingested into the unimap map maker @xcite to produce the final maps . the spire data ( at 250 @xmath5 m , 350 @xmath5 m , and 500 @xmath5 m ) were reduced using modified pipeline scripts of hipe version 10 .",
    "data taken during the turnaround of the satellite were included in order to assure a larger area covered by the observations and enough overlap . because the observed galactic regions are dominated by extended emission of the interstellar medium ,",
    "extended emission relative gain factors were applied to the bolometer time - lines . the resulting level 1 contexts for each scan direction",
    "were then combined using the naive map maker in the destriper module .",
    "the final absolute flux calibration for both pacs and spire maps was performed by adding a zero - level offset derived by comparing the _ herschel _ data with the _ planck _ and _ iras _ data of the same area of the sky .",
    "a dust model has been assumed for extrapolating the flux at the _ herschel _ wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the final flux accuracy is better than 20 per cent .",
    "notably , the lupus 1 maps were affected by stray moonlight , visible as a bright vertical band in each image .",
    "we removed this contamination by evaluating the stray - light contribution from the difference between the observed map ( affected by stray - light ) and the model used for the flux calibration .",
    "this procedure worked well but not for the 70 @xmath5 m image for which the correction could not be applied .",
    "the 70 @xmath5 m map , however , was not used for the production of the column density maps ( see sect . [ sec_cdmap ] ) , that therefore are corrected from the stray - light effect .",
    "a cs ( 21 ) line map of the lupus 1 and 3 clouds was acquired at the 22-m _ mopra _ radio telescope using the on the fly observing mode with the narrow band mode of the unsw - mopra spectrometer ( unsw - mops ) digital filterbank back - end .",
    "the velocity resolution at 97.981 ghz is 0.1 km s@xmath6 the typical rms of the single spectrum is @xmath0 0.4 k and the half power beam width is 35  arcsec .",
    "part of these maps have been already published in @xcite , where details regarding the data reduction can be found . in may 2012 , we acquired new cs ( 21 ) spectra toward the lupus 3 cloud extending the coverage of the region with respect to the previous published map .",
    "the cs ( 21 ) maps cover only the brighter and denser part of the lupus 1 and 3 clouds , approximately the region above the 4 mag of visual extinction .",
    "the column density maps of the three lupus clouds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_lup1 ] , [ fig:1_lup3 ] and [ fig:1_lup4 ] . the maps were produced by applying a grey - body fit in each pixel to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the four surface brightness values at 160 @xmath5 m , 250 @xmath5 m , 350 @xmath5 m and 500 @xmath5 m smoothed to a common spatial resolution of 36 arcsec , i.e. the resolution of the 500 @xmath5 m map and resampled with a pixel size of 14 arcsec .",
    "the spatial resolution of the column density maps corresponds to a linear scale of 0.026 pc for lupus 1 and 4 ( distance of 150 pc ) and 0.035 pc for lupus 3 ( distance of 200 pc ) . for the grey - body fitting ,",
    "we assumed a dust opacity of @xmath7=0.144 @xmath8g@xmath6 ( already accounting for a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 ) , a grain emissivity parameter @xmath9=2 ( cf .",
    "hildebrand 1983 ) and a mean molecular weight @xmath5=2.8 , values adopted as the standard by the hgbs consortium .",
    "previous works ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) estimated that the column densities derived with these assumptions are accurate to 50 per cent for dense cores .",
    "the h@xmath10 column density towards the lupus clouds is typically low , with the denser region corresponding to visual extinction between 3 mag and 6 mag and a very small portion of the clouds at @xmath11 7 mag .",
    ".parameters of the lupus clouds . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ pdfparam ]            we separated the pdfs into ones with pixels on filaments and one with pixels off filaments ( fig . [ pdf_fig ] ) . in this analysis",
    "we excluded pixels specifically belonging to dense cores , masking all the pixels within the hpbw from their reference positions .",
    "such exclusion allows us to separate the contribution of the cores from that of the filaments at the high column density end of the distribution , where we expect a strong contribution from gravitationally bound structures .",
    "the off - filament pdf shows a log - normal distribution at low column densities but still has a power - law tail at higher column densities , albeit steeper than the total pdf . on the other hand , on - filament",
    "pdf makes up the bluk of the power - law tail at higher column densities , confirming that the higher density medium is almost confined in filaments .",
    "a similar result has also been found by @xcite for filaments in a portion of the galactic plane and by @xcite in acquila . since deviations from the log - normal distribution in the form of a power law at high column densities",
    "are predicted for self - gravitating clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , what we observe is an indication that self - gravity is important in some non - cores portions of the filaments and that locally the denser material contained in filaments , but still not in confined in a core , may undergo a gravitational collapse .",
    "this hypothesis can be also supported by the morphology of the material that composes the power - law tail of the pdfs .",
    "these pixels can be spatially identified by plotting the contour of the column density at which the on  filament distribution deviates from the off ",
    "filaments one . this column density threshold is around 7@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the structures showed by this contour , although sitted on filaments , are rather clumpy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_clump_lup3 ] ) indicating that they are likely affected by gravitational collapse . a further indication of gravitational collapse in the identified structures is the link between their radial profiles and the index of the power  law in the pdf .",
    "a filamentary collapsing structure would give a radial profile @xmath12 where @xmath13 is related to the exponential of the pdf power law tail @xmath14 through the relation @xmath13=1 - 1/@xmath14 .",
    "assuming for @xmath14 the fitted values given in table [ pdfparam ] , the corresponding filament profile would be very shallow with @xmath13=1.38 , 1.40 and 1.42 for lupus 1 , 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "by contrast , clumpy collapsing regions would have a radial profile @xmath15 with @xmath13=1 - 2/@xmath14 , namely @xmath13=1.77 , 1.80 and 1.83 for lupus 1 , 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "these profiles fit very well with the classical values given from gravitationally - bound ( free  fall and collapsing ) structures with @xmath13 between 1.5 and 2 .",
    "furthermore , we checked the radial profiles of the regions above the 7@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 threshold in lupus 1 and 3 ( an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_clump_lup3 ] ) and we found @xmath16=1.89 for lupus 1 and @xmath16=1.95 for lupus 3 , indicating local and clumpy collapsing regions rather than filamentary regions .",
    "10@xmath2 @xmath3 is drawn , showing that the higher column density material is confined in rather clumpy structures .",
    "_ bottom : _ radial profile of clump 1 .",
    "we fitted the external part with a function of the form n(h@xmath10 ) @xmath17 , obtaining a best - fit value of @xmath13= 1.9 indicative of a gravitationally bound core.,title=\"fig : \" ] 10@xmath2 @xmath3 is drawn , showing that the higher column density material is confined in rather clumpy structures .",

    "analysing the morphological distribution of the dense material in the lupus complex , we find that almost all the material at visual extinctions larger than 2 mag is arranged in filaments and that some filamentary structures are present also in less dense region , e.g. in zones at @xmath18 1 mag .",
    "the lupus clouds are characterised by having low column densities , both in the dense material arranged in filaments , whose average column density is @xmath01.5@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 , as well as in the diffuse medium , as seen from the peaks in the pdf distributions between 5@xmath110@xmath19@xmath3 and 10@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "the absence of very high column density gas and the predominance of low column density gas of course have an impact on the typical mass of the stars formed in lupus that is quite low .",
    "lupus is in fact one of the main low - mass star - forming complexes and its stellar population is dominated by mid m - type stars @xcite with a relative fraction of low - mass stars greater than other low - mass star - forming regions such as taurus . in comparison to other molecular clouds , the star formation regime in lupus , in terms of star formation rate and stellar clustering ,",
    "represents an intermediate case between heavily clustered , active and more isolated , quiescent star forming regions .",
    "our study reveals that also the diffuse matter from which the stars are formed shows the same property : both the pdfs and the distribution of the filaments column density in lupus are more similar to the values found in the quiescent polaris region , rather than in the more active and massive aquila and orion star - forming regions",
    ".       pc@xmath6 . ]",
    "a key physical parameter for filaments is the mass per unit length .",
    "theoretical models of isothermal infinite cylindrical filaments confined by the external pressure of the ambient medium , predict the existence of a maximum equilibrium value to the mass per unit length @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath5 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath21 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath22 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath23 the gravitational constant . when the filament mass per unit length is higher than this maximum value the filament is not thermally supported and it will collapse . in fig .",
    "[ fig_linemass ] , we show the distribution of the masses per unit length of the branches of the filaments in lupus .",
    "we found that almost all the filament branches have mass per unit length lower than the critical value of 16.4 m@xmath24 pc@xmath6 for radial gravitational collapse and fragmentation of a cylindrical , isothermal filament with a typical temperature of 10 k. previous studies ( @xcite , 2014 ; @xcite ) have suggested that only filaments with mass per unit length above this critical value ( thermally supercritical filaments ) are associated to star formation activity .",
    "however , in lupus there is an evident star formation activity even if the large majority of filaments are subcritical .",
    "more specifically , we have found that some subcritical filaments contain starless cores that have been classified as gravitationally bound cores by @xcite , since they satisfy the condition @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the bonnor ",
    "ebert mass of a core with equivalent size and temperature of the observed core .",
    "the gravitational bound cores are considered good prestellar core candidates in which new stars may form . in @xcite the mass of the sources have been derived from a grey - body fitting of the sed of the fluxes measured the _ herschel _ maps with the cutex algorithm @xcite . anyway , disentangling the emission of a compact source from the emission of the embedding filament in the _ herschel _ maps is not a trivial task .",
    "the most critical factors are the fit of the complex background and of the source size that introduces large uncertainty in the core mass estimate and therefore in establishing if the core is gravitationally bound or not .",
    "for this reason it is of fundamental importance , when estimating the flux of the sources in a complex region like molecular clouds , to compare the results of at least two completely independent methods to have an idea of the robustness of the measured fluxes .    to this aim we selected one",
    "well defined compact source in lupus 1  the prestellar core l1 - 11 in @xcite at r.a.(j2000 ) = 15@xmath2742@xmath28506 and dec(j2000 ) = -3413254  and we extracted the fluxes at 250 @xmath5 m , 350 @xmath5 m and 500 @xmath5 m in our new _",
    "maps by using the hyper algorithm @xcite which computes aperture photometry instead of synthetic photometry like cutex .",
    "the corresponding sed is reported in fig .",
    "[ seds ] together with a grey - body fitting with fixed @xmath29 = 10 k and @xmath9 = 2 .",
    "the best fit core mass is 0.25 m@xmath24 , similar to the bonnor ",
    "ebert mass of a core with the same size of 36 arcsec and temperature of 10 k , @xmath26 = 0.26 m@xmath24 . in conclusion ,",
    "the hyper photometry confirms the result previously found by @xcite by using the cutex photometry that this source is a good candidate prestellar core .",
    "= 10 k and @xmath9=2 .",
    "the error associated to the fluxes corresponds to 20 per cent .",
    "a.2 in @xcite for the five _ herschel _ maps of the l1 - 11 core . ]",
    "interestingly , this candidate prestellar core is associated to a subcritical filament with a mass per unit length of 5 m@xmath24 pc@xmath6 .",
    "note that the filament can be still classified as subcritical even if we consider the largest uncertainty quoted for the column density , namely a factor of 2 .",
    "we stress that our estimate of the filament mass per unit length is a value averaged along the branch .",
    "in other words , we are assuming that the total mass measured in the entire structure was initially uniformly distributed along the filament branch when it formed .",
    "therefore , even if the branch is on average subcritical , the presence of a gravitationally bound core is a indication that locally , in a smaller portion of the filament , the density is enough to become gravitationally unstable",
    ". the demonstration of if and how much the association of prestellar cores with thermally subcritical filaments is statistically significant requires the complete catalogue of prestellar cores in this region and it is deferred to a forthcoming paper ( benedettini et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .      in sect .",
    "[ arangment ] we showed that the filaments orientation in lupus is correlated with the local magnetic field .",
    "the action of the magnetic field on filaments has been considered by models of @xcite and @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the ratio between the mass per unit length and the virial mass per unit length @xmath30 is a key parameter of a filament that indicates whether it is in pressure equilibrium ( @xmath311 ) or a poloidal ( @xmath321 ) or toroidal ( @xmath331 ) field is required to confine the filament .",
    "we calculated the virial mass per unit length by using the total velocity dispersion of the particles @xmath34 where the thermal dispersion is @xmath35 and the non - thermal velocity dispersion is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean molecular weight of the observed molecule .",
    "we derived the non - thermal contribution for the filaments in lupus from the line width of the cs ( 21 ) line ( @xmath37=44 ) , assuming that the line is optically thin .",
    "the line was observed with the _ mopra _ telescope @xcite , at a spatial resolution of 35 arcsec , similar to that of our column density maps .",
    "the typical fwhm is about 0.8 km s@xmath6 and 0.4 km s@xmath6 for lupus 1 and 3 respectively that correspond to a total velocity dispersion of 0.39 and 0.25 km s@xmath6 , values in agreement with the typical values found in thermically subcritical filaments @xcite .",
    "the corresponding virial masses per unit length ( 70 m@xmath24 pc@xmath6 for lupus 1 and 30 m@xmath24 pc@xmath6 for lupus 3 ) are higher than average masses per unit length measured in lupus indicating that the observed filaments are gravitationally unbound structures .",
    "therefore , it is possible that an external agent will be required to provide confinement of the filaments .",
    "since we find that @xmath33 1 a binding , toroidal dominated , magnetic field is possibly confining filaments rather than just the external pressure , in agreement with what found also in other filamentary clouds @xcite .",
    "how filaments form from the diffuse material of the molecular clouds is still unknown .",
    "models for filament formation invoke shock compression ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , shear and energy dissipation in large - scale mhd turbulence flow ( e.g. , @xcite ) requiring the presence of strong magnetic fields . the first scenario foresees randomly distributed filaments without any correlation between the directions of clouds and mean magnetic field directions ( padoan et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the second scenario",
    ", however , the competition between gravitational and turbulent pressures in a medium dominated by magnetic fields will shape the cloud to be elongated either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field when reaching equilibrium .",
    "in contrast to the shocked cloud model , streaming motions are not expected in the equilibrium stage of the magnetic field dominated model . in lupus",
    "we observe a significant alignment of the filament directions with the ambient magnetic field and the absence of gas motions inside the filament , both indications of a significant role of the local magnetic field in the formation of filaments . on the other hand",
    ", self - gravity seems not to play a major role in the filaments formation and fragmentation .",
    "indeed , most of the filament branches in lupus have average masses per unit length smaller than the critical value for radial gravitational collapse and no evidence of contraction has been seen in the gas kinematics .",
    "the kinematical analysis of the filaments identified in column density maps of the lupus molecular clouds showed that they are composed by a network of short , coherent kinematical structures at slightly different velocity . similarly",
    ", the c@xmath38o ( 10 ) map of the b211/3 filament in taurus revealed that the mostly continuous 10 pc long structure @xcite , visible in the column density map , is actually composed of many distinct components of gas , each of which has a coherent thermal velocity profile and typical length of 0.5 pc @xcite .",
    "the inspection of the spire 250 @xmath5 m map , where the small scale structure of the dust emission is better defined thanks to the higher spatial resolution and sensitivity , shows and excellent correspondence between the dust continuum b211/3 filament and the velocity - coherent fibres traced in c@xmath38o @xcite .",
    "the median length of the coherent kinematical filaments observed in lupus is similar to the typical length of the fibres observed in taurus .",
    "this structure of interwined fibres was not observed in intermediate- and high - mass star - forming regions that have filaments usually thermally supercritical and with much higher column densities than observed in lupus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the kinematical analysis of some massive filaments have shown the presence of velocity gradients indicative of contraction and gravitational collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , not observed in the lupus low density filaments .",
    "we have presented column density maps derived from the sed fitting of the fluxes at four far - infrared bands observed by _",
    "herschel _ for the lupus 1 , 3 , and 4 star - forming regions . from these maps we extracted the filaments and calculated their physical properties .",
    "the lupus clouds are characterised by low column densities both for the denser material assembled in filaments , whose average column density is @xmath01.5@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 , and from the diffuse medium , as testified from the peak of the pdfs between 5@xmath110@xmath19 @xmath3 and 10@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "this low column density regime of course reflects upon on the mass of the formed stars in lupus that indeed is low . comparing our filaments catalogue with the preliminary list of prestellar and protostellar sources identified by @xcite in the _ herschel _ maps",
    ", we find that most of the sources are located in filaments , in particular close to the central densest parts , testifying that filaments are fragmented and contain the seeds for the formation of new stars .",
    "however , we find that , if we consider some average physical properties such as the average mass per unit length , most of the filaments in lupus turn out to be gravitationally unbound , having average mass per unit length lower than their respective virial critical masses .",
    "in addition , they seem to be stable self - gravitating structures , having average masses per unit length lower than the maximum critical value for radial gravitational collapse of an isothermal infinitely long filament .",
    "indeed , no evidence of filament contraction has been seen in the gas kinematics and each filament has an independent , coherent velocity structure .    on the other hand , prestellar cores and protostars are observed in some of these supposedly globally subcritical filaments .",
    "this occurrence is an indication that in the low density regime the critical condition for the formation of stars can be reached only locally and it is not a global property of the filament .",
    "in fact , we have found evidences of the predominance of self - gravity in the highest column density regions of filaments in the fact that the power law tail of the observed pdfs are composed mostly by the pixels of the filaments and that these pixels belong to roundish clumpy structures with a radial profile compatible with clumpy collapsing regions .",
    "multiple observational evidences indicate the key role that the magnetic field plays in the filament formation and confinement in this region : _",
    "i ) _ the masses per unit length are lower than the virial critical value , _ ii ) _ one of the two peaks of the distribution of the position angle of the branches corresponds to the direction of the magnetic field , and _",
    "iii ) _ the absence of streaming motions observed in the filament kinematics .",

    "<S> we have studied the filaments extracted from the column density maps of the nearby lupus 1 , 3 , and 4 molecular clouds , derived from photometric maps observed with the _ herschel _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> filaments in the lupus clouds have quite low column densities , with a median value of @xmath01.5@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 and most have masses per unit length lower than the maximum critical value for radial gravitational collapse . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , no evidence of filament contraction has been seen in the gas kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that some filaments , that on average are thermally subcritical , contain dense cores that may eventually form stars . </S>",
    "<S> this is an indication that in the low column density regime , the critical condition for the formation of stars may be reached only locally and this condition is not a global property of the filament . finally , </S>",
    "<S> in lupus we find multiple observational evidences of the key role that the magnetic field plays in forming filaments , and determining their confinement and dynamical evolution .    </S>",
