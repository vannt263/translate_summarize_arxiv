    "if a significant fraction of the dark halo of the milky way is made up of machos ( massive compact halo objects ) , it should be possible to detect them by searching for gravitational microlensing @xcite . as a macho passes near the line of sight to a background star",
    ", the star appears to be magnified by a factor @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the distance from the macho to the line of sight , and the einstein ring radius @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the macho , @xmath10 is the observer - star distance , and @xmath11 is the ratio of the observer - lens and observer - star distances .",
    "since machos are in motion @xmath12km / sec ) relative to the line of sight , this magnification is time dependent , with @xmath13 , where @xmath14^{1 \\over 2}. \\label{equt}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is the time of peak magnification , and @xmath16 is the event duration , which can be written @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the macho velocity relative to the line - of - sight . for more detailed information ,",
    "see and .",
    "if the halo consisted entirely of objects with masses under about @xmath19 the average duration of microlensing would be less than 1.5 days , and the events would last only about three hours if the halo were made of @xmath20 objects . in order to clearly see the shape of the microlensing curve for such low mass lenses , images of a lensed star",
    "must be taken in rapid succession during the event .",
    "such an experiment was undertaken by the eros collaboration @xcite , in which a total of about 82,000 stars were imaged up to 46 times per night for several months .",
    "no microlensing events were found , and it was reported that objects with masses @xmath21 can not comprise the entire galactic halo at the 90% c.l .",
    "we have not followed this approach , but we have used a different technique also capable of setting limits on low mass machos .",
    "the macho collaboration has been monitoring the brightnesses of several million stars in the lmc , smc , and galactic bulge since 1992 july using the 50 telescope at mt .",
    "stromlo , australia . a dichroic beamsplitter and filters are used to provide simultaneous measurements in red and blue passbands @xcite .",
    "the observing strategy for the first two years of lmc data was designed to be sensitive to objects with masses @xmath22 , so a typical lmc field was generally imaged at most once or twice per clear night .",
    "therefore microlensing events with durations under a few days will have very few magnified points on their light curves and would show up in our data as upward excursions of one , two or three consecutive measurements , occurring on stars which otherwise appeared completely normal . in this paper",
    "we search specifically for such short duration  spike \" events .",
    "clearly , if any spikes are detected , no conclusion could be drawn regarding their origin since there would be insufficient detail in the lightcurves .",
    "therefore , the technique described here is most useful when few if any spikes are found , in which case useful upper limits can be placed on the prevalence of low mass machos . after applying selection criteria described below , we do not find any such spikes and so are able to strongly constrain the existence of low mass objects in the halo of the milky way .",
    "the analysis reported here uses the first two years of lmc data @xcite .",
    "twenty - two fields of 0.5 square degree each were monitored on every clear night from 1992 july 20 to 1994 october 26 , for a total of 10827 observations .",
    "a total of about 8.5 million stars are used in this analysis .",
    "the images are taken with a refurbished telescope system @xcite and a special purpose camera system @xcite , photometrically reduced using a special purpose code named sodophot @xcite , and assembled into time series for analysis .",
    "each lightcurve consists of many measurements of the flux of a star in two filter bands ( called  red \" and  blue \" ) , as well as estimated errors in the flux measurement and several quantities used to detect probable systematic error in the measurement .",
    "these quantities include the crowding , @xmath23 of psf fit , missing pixel fraction , cosmic ray flag , and sky background . as in the standard analysis",
    "these measures are used to remove suspect data before any further analysis is performed .",
    "also , as in the standard analysis , several properties of the expected microlensing signal are used to eliminate stars and events which are unlikely to arise from microlensing . after imposing such selection criteria ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the number of actual microlensing events which would have be removed by these cuts , and this detection efficiency calculation is discussed in the following sections .",
    "because this search is for short duration events , one of the most powerful signatures of microlensing , the shape of the lightcurve ( eq s [ [ eqamp ] ] and [ [ equt ] ] ) , can not be used as a selection criterion .",
    "since there are three free parameters for the microlensing lightcurve shape , we would need four or more observations during the event to get a meaningful fit .",
    "therefore , any phenomenon which causes a significant upward excursion in one or two observations could be mistaken for very short duration microlensing . looking through our data",
    ", we find many one - observation excursions .",
    "a partial list of causes includes satellite tracks and glints , telescope slips , and asteroids . in order to reduce this background ,",
    "we consider only those instances where two or three exposures were taken of the same same star on the same night .",
    "since each exposure gives both red and blue flux measurements , we define a  quad \" as a sequence of 2 ( or 3 ) exposures of a star which are on the same night . in the first two years of lmc data we have @xmath24 quads with two measurements on the same night and @xmath25 quads with three .",
    "we then require that all the measurements in the quad be significantly magnified , and we also make use of the fact that for very short duration microlensing , the measurements of the star on the previous and following nights should not have significant upward excursions .",
    "thus each quad represents a potential detection of short duration microlensing events , and because the microlensing rate is proportional to @xmath26 @xcite a substantial number of quads would be magnified if the milky way halo were made of low mass machos .",
    "we define the magnification of a given measurement as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the flux of the measurement and @xmath29 is the median flux of all the points in the relevant pass band that pass the quality cuts described above . in order to reduce the statistical probability of random fluctuations in measured flux giving false triggers , we require that all four ( or all six ) measurements have positive excursions of more than @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is set by the flux measurement error . that is , we require that the magnification be above a threshold magnification @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the largest magnification error of the four or six quad measurements . by using only these sets of measurements and setting a threshold proportional to the error",
    ", the probability of false event detection can be greatly reduced while still allowing a strong limit to be set . with a threshold @xmath33 and a total of @xmath35 quads",
    ", the expected number of false triggers from statistical fluctuations is @xmath36 .",
    "( this estimate assumes gaussian errors , so realistically the non - gaussian tails will increase this number substantially . ) the @xmath37 threshold was chosen _ a priori _ because after investigation of several possible analysis methods on a small subset of the data , it appeared most likely to give few ( if any ) events and a significant detection efficiency .",
    "in addition to the above criteria , we demand that there be a reasonable number of high quality data points on the star in order to accurately determine the baseline flux .",
    "thus we cut on the number of simultaneous red and blue data points and the average photometric error . in our data",
    "set we have found a large number of periodic and non - periodic variables which can be eliminated due to the fact that they vary continually , so we also demand that the lensed star not be flagged as a variable . next , since microlensing is so rare , we do not expect more than one microlensing event to take place on a given star , so we can also eliminate stars in which two or more such events are found .",
    "finally , since gravitational lensing should magnify all wavebands by the same amount , we can demand that the four or six spike points be achromactic within errors .",
    "therefore we make the following set of cuts :    \\1 ) the star must have at least six observations in which both the red and blue data points pass the cuts in crowding , seeing , etc .",
    "\\2 ) the star must have @xmath38 .",
    "\\3 ) both the red and blue points in the measurements in the quad , immediately before the quad , and immediately after the quad must pass the cuts in crowding , seeing , etc . and have a magnification error less than 0.5 .",
    "\\4 ) the  robust \" @xmath23 ( that is , a @xmath23 fit with the highest and lowest ten percent of the data excluded ) of a fit to a constant flux must be less than 0.9 in both red and blue .",
    "\\5 ) @xmath39 for all points in the quad , where @xmath34 is the maximum error of the measurements in the quad .",
    "\\6 ) @xmath40 for the red and blue points in the measurement previous to the quad and the measurement following the quad .",
    "\\7 ) the measurements in the quad must be achromatic within errors , that is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "\\8 ) there may be at most one event per star .",
    "cuts 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 are for the elimination of false events caused by variable stars , cuts 1 and 3 are to eliminate background caused by poor photometry , cut 5 is to reduce the chance of statistical fluctuations or single - observation glitches causing an event , and cut 6 is to eliminate longer duration events .",
    "see figure [ figdat ] for an example of our data and a monte carlo event which passes these cuts .",
    "these cuts were run on the first two years of lmc data , and no events were found . to test the robustness of these cuts",
    ", the analysis was run with thresholds varying between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "while a few events were found at thresholds below @xmath37 , none were found at the _ a priori _ threshold of @xmath37 .",
    "this will be discussed further in section [ results ] .",
    "in order to use our non - detection of spike events to make a statement about the content of the milky way halo , we need to predict the number of events we would have expected to find if the halo is made of low mass machos .",
    "thus we need to know the efficiency with which our experiment , in combination with the above selection criteria , would have detected short duration microlensing events if in fact such events occurred .",
    "the search for spike events is sensitive only to durations of about 0.1 to 4 days , corresponding to masses of about @xmath45 to @xmath46 ( see eq . [ [ eqt_hat ] ] ) , and we need to use a halo model to make a connection between event duration , rate , and macho mass .",
    "we first consider a simple spherical halo model with mass density @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the local dark matter mass density , @xmath49 is the distance to the center of the galaxy , @xmath50 is the distance of the sun from the galactic center , and @xmath51 is the galactic core radius",
    ". showed that the microlensing rate of a @xmath52-function mass distribution is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath32 is the magnification threshold for an event .",
    "( the expression for @xmath55 is slightly different from that given in griest ( 1991 ) because we use @xmath56 kpc for the distance to the lmc , rather than @xmath57 kpc . ) in an experiment the number of microlensing events which are expected to be detected is given by @xmath58 where @xmath55 is the microlensing rate ( in event / year / star ) , @xmath59 is the effective exposure ( in star - years ) and @xmath60 is the average detection efficiency .",
    "the probability of an event occurring with duration @xmath61 can be written @xmath62 where , in the approximation of a stationary line of sight , the distribution of event durations is given by @xcite    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath6 and @xmath66 are the galactic coordinates of the source star , @xmath67 is the solar circular velocity , and @xmath68 .",
    "the probability that such an event is actually observed depends strongly on the duration , since the spike selection criteria above eliminate the possibility of detecting long duration events or events which last only an hour . we can thus define the average efficiency of observing such events as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the detection efficiency as a function of event duration .",
    "when the impact parameter of the lens is comparable to the size of the lensed object , the magnification can differ significantly from the point source approximation given in equation ( [ eqamp ] ) . for a lensed star with radius @xmath71",
    ", we define @xmath72 as the `` effective radius '' of the star ( the radius of the star normalized to the einstein radius and scaled to the lens plane ) .",
    "the point source approximation will then break down completely for @xmath73 because only the fraction of the surface of the star inside the einstein ring radius will be significantly magnified . in the case of a star of constant surface brightness",
    ", we use @xcite @xmath74 for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath59 , and @xmath80 are elliptic integrals of the first , second , and third kind .",
    "there are two effects from the finite source size .",
    "first , the maximum possible magnification @xmath81 becomes very low for lower mass lenses . for a star with @xmath82 and a lens at @xmath83",
    ", we have @xmath84 for a lens with @xmath85 .",
    "however , with @xmath86 we have @xmath87 and with @xmath88 we get @xmath89 .",
    "because we are searching for significant magnifications , this effect would tend to lower the detection efficiency for lower mass lenses .",
    "the second effect of a finite source size is that the star is magnified for a longer period of time .",
    "this occurs because a fraction of the star can be close enough to the lens to be significantly magnified even if the lens is far from the center of the star ( see figure [ figfs ] ) .",
    "this effect increases the detection efficiency for low mass lenses whose average event duration is shorter than the minimum detectable point source event time scale .",
    "these two effects mostly cancel each other out , with the detection efficiency increasing slightly for very low mass machos .",
    "it is clear that the shape of the light curve is strongly dependent on the lens distance @xmath11 , so the detection efficiency is a function of both @xmath11 and @xmath16 . since @xmath16 is a function of both @xmath11 and @xmath90 , we use @xmath91 in order to simplify the efficiency analysis .",
    "the average detection efficiency ( eq . [ [ eqprob ] ] ) then becomes @xmath92 where @xmath93 is some upper limit on the perpendicular velocity of the lens .",
    "the differential rate used in equation ( [ eqeffxv ] ) can be found from equation ( [ eqrate ] ) using a simple change of variables : @xmath94",
    "to measure the detection efficiency @xmath95 , a monte carlo simulation was performed in which randomly generated microlensing events were added to each star in the database .",
    "then the same analysis used to search for spike events was performed on these simulated data sets . as a function of the lens position and perpendicular velocity of these events one can then find the fraction of simulated events which were recovered and define this as @xmath96 . from simple geometry",
    "one expects microlensing events to have a uniform distribution in minimum impact parameter @xmath97 .",
    "a minimum error of @xmath98 is added to each data point , so the minimum @xmath43 threshold is given by @xmath99 , or @xmath100 .",
    "( as stated previously , the analysis was run on several thresholds varying between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so the minimum threshold was used to set the upper limit of the @xmath97 distribution .",
    "this somewhat lowers the detection efficiency for higher thresholds , but the differential microlensing rate given in eq . [ [ eqratexv ] ] is correspondingly higher due to the factor of @xmath101 and there is no net effect in the final result . ) therefore , in performing the monte carlo , the simulated microlensing events were added with a uniform distribution of @xmath97 from 0 to 2.262 . to adequately sample the widest possible range of event durations and finite source lightcurve shapes , the events were generated using a distribution of @xmath11 which was uniform over @xmath102 , and a @xmath90 distribution uniform over @xmath103 . in order to improve statistics",
    "the simulated events were forced to peak during a quad ( that is , @xmath15 between the time of measurements previous to and following a quad ) .",
    "the total exposure time used to calculate @xmath104 was adjusted accordingly by using the total `` quad time '' rather than the length of the observing run . thus no simulated events were added during weeks when the telescope was down .",
    "the shape of the light curve is a function of the radius of the star for low mass machos , and the radius of a star is correlated with its magnitude . because brighter stars tend to give lower errors in measured magnification , it follows that the shape of a light curve is correlated with the event detection threshold .",
    "therefore the radius of the source was estimated from its color and magnitude , and this radius was used in conjunction with the observer - lens distance @xmath11 to determine the shape of the simulated light curves . although limb darkening can change the shape of the light curve @xcite , limb darkening coefficients are not well known for such a large sample of stars . an investigation into the effect of limb darkening",
    "has shown that the resulting uncertainties in magnification are much smaller than those caused by the uncertainty in the radius of the source star , so the effects of limb darkening are ignored in this analysis .",
    "since the detection threshold is proportional to the maximum error of the points in a quad , it is important to treat the errors correctly when adding a fake microlensing event to a light curve .",
    "the error of the magnification @xmath105 can be approximated by    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the error from sky background , @xmath28 is the total measured flux of the star , and @xmath108 is the minimum error added after photometric analysis . the minimum error is also added in the standard analysis photometry @xcite in order to account for several sources of systematic error in the photometry .",
    "there are two limiting cases of the above formula :  sky - dominated \" error and  flux - dominated \" error . in the case where the error comes mostly from the sky subtraction ,",
    "the error in the flux does not change significantly when flux is added to create a simulated microlensing event . on the other hand ,",
    "when the error is dominated by the poisson statistics of the flux , the error in the added flux should be scaled by @xmath109 . because the flux error is larger , giving higher thresholds , this case was used in the monte carlo to get a conservative measure of the efficiency .",
    "( the minimum error was subtracted before the errors were adjusted and then added in again afterward , just as the minimum error is added in after the photometric reductions in the standard analysis . ) the true efficiency is expected to be closer to the flux error case , because in general the sky error contributes significantly only to dim stars which already have a fairly low efficiency due to their large error bars ( large threshold ) .    because of our crowded fields and poor seeing , many of our photometric objects are actually blends of two or more stars .",
    "when a blended star is lensed , the measured magnification can be significantly smaller than the true magnification . to quantify this effect ,",
    "artificial stars were added to real images taken under a variety of observing conditions and the photometry code was run again .",
    "we thus created a series of response functions of recovered vs. added flux , and when a simulated microlensing event is generated the photometric object is matched to one of these response functions using the object s magnitude .",
    "the observing conditions on each point in the light curve are then matched to similar conditions in the response function , and the recovered flux is added to the data",
    ". a detailed description of this analysis can be found in .",
    "the effects of blending on the detection efficiency are twofold .",
    "first , the lower measured magnification will lower the efficiency as fewer quads will be above the threshold magnification .",
    "however , if an object is a blend of two or more stars , then there are two or more stars that may be lensed .",
    "thus the total number of stars in the data set is larger than the number of photometric objects , and our total exposure is significantly increased .",
    "a monte carlo event with a large blend fraction ( and significant finite source effects ) can be seen in figure [ figdatfs ] .",
    "because the blending effects described above are a function of the magnitude of the lensed object , it follows that the detection efficiency depends on the magnitude of the source as well as the lens position and velocity . using an infinitesmal bin width",
    ", the efficiency @xmath110 can be written @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the average of the red and blue magnitudes of the lensed star ( this value is the unblended stellar magnitude which is determined by the blending response function ) , @xmath113 is the number of fake events added to the data , and @xmath114 is the number of these events recovered by the analysis . to calculate the number of expected events",
    ", one must integrate the efficiency over the stellar luminosity function @xmath115 : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the effective exposure , or `` quad time '' of a given star . to calculate the efficiency",
    ", we have @xmath118 where the sum is over all recovered events .",
    "because we add one simulated event to each object in the database , we can write @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the sodophot object luminosity function ( that is , the luminosity distribution of objects recovered by the photometric reductions of the images ) .",
    "this function is used because the response function stellar magnitudes follow the sodophot object distribution , and the response functions are chosen uniformly from this distribution @xcite .",
    "the events are added uniformly in @xmath11 and @xmath90 , which gives @xmath121 where the factor @xmath122 is a normalization constant .",
    "the number of expected events then becomes @xmath123    approximately 6.5% of the stars used in this analysis can be found in more than one field ( alcock 1996b ) , and we must scale the number of expected events accordingly .",
    "however , the possibility of double counting in this analysis occurs only when double or triple exposures are taken on overlapping fields on the same night .",
    "this only happens in about @xmath124 of our quads , so we subtract 4.4% from our number of expected events rather than 6.5% .",
    "a plot of @xmath104 vs mass for a @xmath52-function mass distribution is given in figure [ fignexp ] .",
    "at the peak at @xmath125 , about 17 events would be expected to have been found if the halo is as modeled in equation ( [ eqmodel ] ) , and consisted entirely of machos of that mass .",
    "equivalently , we may convert the number of expected events into upper limits on the allowed halo mass fraction that can be contributed from objects in the excluded mass range .",
    "such a plot is given in figure [ figfrac ] .",
    "using the fact that no events were found we can place strong limits on the halo of the milky way .",
    "the 95% poisson c.l . when @xmath126 is @xmath127 events , so for the simple spherical halo model masses between @xmath128 and @xmath129 are ruled out at the 95% c.l .",
    "although these limits are for a @xmath52-function mass distribution , any model distribution containing a combination of masses in this range is also ruled out at the 95% c.l . @xcite .    also shown in figures",
    "[ fignexp ] and [ figfrac ] are the results from the eros ccd experiment @xcite .",
    "although they give a stronger limit for @xmath130 , the limits set by this analysis give the strongest limits to date for @xmath131 .",
    "as mentioned previously , the analysis was run with thresholds varying from @xmath43 to @xmath44 in order to determine the robustness of the analysis .",
    "a plot of the number of expected and observed events as a function of threshold can be found in figure [ fignvst ] , and the corresponding plot of halo fraction upper limit vs. threshold can be found in figure [ figfvst ] .",
    "a total of 11 events were found which passed various thresholds between @xmath43 and @xmath132 , but no events were found at thresholds of @xmath37 and higher . of the 11 events found , 8 were on stars with @xmath133 and are likely low level variables which fell through the variable star cuts . of the three remaining events , two occurred in the same field on the same night which indicates possible problems with the observations , and inspection of the second image in the quad",
    "shows a likely telescope slip during the exposure .",
    "the remaining event passes only the @xmath43 threshold cut . in order to reduce these backgrounds in future analysis runs ,",
    "stars with @xmath133 will be cut as will images with more than one event , and it has been determined that these cuts will reduce the number of expected events by about 20% . however , because neither the number of expected events or the number of observed events varies drastically with threshold , the analysis using the _ a priori _ @xmath37 threshold is robust and the limits set on the abundance of low mass machos are valid .",
    "the standard analysis method of fitting microlensing curves to the data is sensitive to machos of masses @xmath134 , and it would be useful to combine the results of the two types of analyses . to avoid double counting of events which could pass both the spike and standard cuts ,",
    "we ran the standard analysis cuts on any simulated events passing the spike event cuts , and any events passing both sets of cuts are so flagged .",
    "the efficiency is then recalculated with the flagged events considered as failing the cuts , and the number of expected events can then be added to the number of expected events from the standard analysis . however , when adding the number of expected events the number of observed events must also be added .",
    "the standard analysis of the first two years of lmc data yields eight likely microlensing events @xcite which would make the combined limit on halo fraction very weak .",
    "however , the eight events all have durations @xmath135 days , and it is very unlikely that these events were caused by machos with @xmath136 . therefore the standard analysis efficiency was recalculated with a cut such that the event duration must be shorter than @xmath137 days .",
    "( @xmath137 days was chosen in order to be conservative . )",

    "we have extended the sensitivity of the macho experiment to two orders of magnitude lower in mass using existing data and without changing observing strategy . objects with masses @xmath3 ( roughly one mars mass to 80 jupiter masses ) can not comprise the entire standard spherical halo mass , and machos in the range @xmath157 make up less than 20% of the halo .",
