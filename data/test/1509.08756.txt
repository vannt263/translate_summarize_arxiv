    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration is one the major advancements in modern cosmology .",
    "the observation of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) combined with observational probes of numerous mounting astronomical evidences like the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure surveys ( lss ) and wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) ( perlmutter et al.1999 , spergel et al.2007 , hawkins 2003 , eisentein et al.2005 ) reveal that the cosmos at present is dominated by exotic energy component named as dark energy ( de )",
    ". the investigation of current cosmic expansion and nature of de has been widespread among the scientists . for this purpose ,",
    "numerous efforts have been made based upon different strategies .",
    "these efforts can be grouped in two categories : introducing new ingredients of de to the entire cosmic energy and modification of einstein - hilbert action to obtain modified theories of gravity such as @xmath0 ( nojiri and odintsov 2011 ) @xmath1 ( ferraro and fiorini 2007 ) where @xmath2 being the torsion , @xmath3 ( harko et al.2011 ) where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the scalar curvature and trace of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath6 ( haghani 2013 ) and gauss - bonnet gravities ( cognola 2006 ) .",
    "it has been the subject of great interest to study the models of anisotropic stars solutions during the last decades ( herrera and santos 1997 ) .",
    "egeland ( 2007 ) investigated that the cosmological constant would exist due to density of the vacuum , this is consequence of modeling the mass and radius of the neutron star . in order to prove this fact egeland used the relativistic equation of hydrostatic equilibrium with fermion equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "as @xmath0 model with constant @xmath4 gives cosmological constant , therefore motivated by this fact , we study the structure of strange stars and concluded that @xmath0 gravity with model @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is constant ) can describes the class of some anisotropic compact strange stars for example x - ray bruster 4@xmath91820 - 30 , x - ray pulsar her x-1 , millisecond pulsar sax j 1808 - 3658 etc . in a very scientific way . during the recent years , dey et al.(1998 ) , usov ( 2004 ) , ruderman ( 1972 ) , mak and harko ( 2002 , 2003 ) have studied the physical properties of strange stars by using different approaches . also , herrera et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have examined all static spherically symmetric solution of einstein field equations and discussed the physical implication of these solutions .",
    "the exact solutions have many applications in astronomy and astrophysics . for examples these can explain the properties and compositions of astrophysical objects .",
    "mak and harko ( 2004 ) presented a class of exact solutions of einstein field equations with anisotropic source .",
    "the physical properties of these solutions imply that matter density as well as tangential and radial pressure are regular inside the compact star .",

    "the study of compact stars such as relativistic massive objects have been the subject of interest in gr as well as in modified theories of gravity ( camenzind 2007 , abbas et al.2014 , abbas et al.2015a , 2015b , 2015c , 2015d , sharif and abbas 2013a , 2013b , sharif and zubair 2013a , 2013b ) .",
    "being highly dense these are small in size and posses the extremely massive structure , and produce a strong gravitational field .",
    "recently , there has been growing interest to study the compact stars in modified theories of gravity like @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "particularly , astashenok ( 2013 ) , presented neutron stars solutions for viable models of @xmath10 gravity",
    ". motivated by this work , we study the compact stars solutions and their dynamical stability for a viable model of @xmath0 gravity . we shall find the exact solutions for quintessence compact stars which are comparable with observational data .",

    "lead to @xmath38 herein , we choose the starobinsky model of the form @xmath39 where @xmath8 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "one can set @xmath40 to find the results in gr . herein , we set @xmath41 .    for this model",
    "the equations ( [ 6])-([8 ] ) become @xmath42    using the relations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we find the following relations @xmath45 we have four unknown functions @xmath46 , and three eqs.([13])-([15 ] ) . to find the explicit relations of these parameters , we assume a relation between radial pressure and energy density of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 plays the role of equation of state parameter .",
    "this relation is the particular form of equation of state , the general form of this equation has been presented by herrera and barreto ( 2013 ) .",

    "here , we discuss some physical conditions which are necessary for the interior solution . in the following , we present the anisotropic behavior and stability conditions .      taking derivatives of equations ( [ 15b ] ) and ( [ 15d ] ) with respect to radial coordinate",
    ", we have @xmath52 similarly , one can find the second derivatives of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    ".    one can explore the behavior of derivatives of @xmath35 and @xmath36 at center @xmath57 of compact star and it can be seen that @xmath58 this indicate the maximality of central density and radial pressure .",
    "hence @xmath35 and @xmath36 attain maximum values at @xmath57 and functional values decreases with the increase in @xmath59 as shown in figures * 1 - 2*. from eqs.([16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) , we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 as shown in figure * 7 * for different strange stars .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath65 , which implies that it is directed outward and repulsive force exists for these strange star models .",
    "recently , goswami et al.(2014 ) , have proved that extra matching conditions that arise in the modified gravity imposes strong constraints on the stellar structure and thermodynamic properties .",
    "they showed that these constraints are non - physical . according to these authors ,",
    "schwarzschild solution is best choice in the exterior region for matching conditions .",

    "these inequalities are firstly formulated in the context of gr for the derivation of some general results involving strong gravitational fields . in gr ,",
    "four types of energy constraints are formulated using a well - known geometrical results refereed as raychaudhuri equation ( explaining the dynamics of matter bits ) .",
    "these constraints are labeled as wec , dec , nec and sec . for an anisotropic fluid ( [ 5 ] ) ,",
    "these are defined as @xmath76 we find that our model satisfies these conditions for specific values of mass and radius which helps to find the unknown parameters for different strange stars . here , we present the evolution of these conditions for strange star her x-1 as shown in figure * 9*. it can be seen that energy conditions are satisfied for our model .      in this section",
    ", we discuss the stability of quintessence star models in @xmath0 theory . to analyze the stability of our model we calculate the radial and transverse speeds as    @xmath77    in the past , herrera and his collaborators ( herrera 1992 ,",
    "chan et al.1993 , di prisco 1997)have developed a new technique to explore the potentially unstable matter configuration and introduced the concept of cracking .",
    "one can analyze the potentially stable and unstable regions regions depending on the difference of sound speeds , the region for which radial sound speed is greater than the transverse sound speed is said to be potentially stable .",
    "we find that radial sound speed is constant ( eq.([22 ] ) ) and plot the transverse sound speed in figure * 10*. it can be seen that @xmath78 satisfy the relation of stable matter configuration @xmath79 .",
