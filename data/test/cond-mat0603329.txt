    "quantitative electronic structure theories are essential to the understanding and designing of novel materials and devices .",
    "it is now generally accepted that transport properties of nanoscale devices depend on both the intrinsic electronic structure of the active channel , as well as its interfacial properties with contacts and other scattering centers .",
    "a particular challenge in this respect is to incorporate both long and short range correlations within the same framework , such as the bulk bandstructure of periodic solids as well as the local chemical properties of clusters , surfaces , and interfaces .",
    "for instance , simulating scanning tunneling spectra ( sts ) of molecules on silicon substrates requires an accurate description of the silicon bulk bandstructure that quantitatively captures not just the bandgap responsible for the onset of negative differential resistance , @xcite but also the multiple effective masses which determine the contact density of states and injection velocities , and the strain parametrizations that capture atomic reconstruction and relaxation near the surface and their bonding with molecular components.@xcite in addition , one needs to describe the electrostatics responsible for band - bending in the silicon depletion layer , the molecular transport levels and their transmission under bias , and finally the electronic properties of the scanning tip and the intervening vacuum layer , all within the same formalism .",
    "it is no surprise therefore that under these circumstances , standard electronic structure techniques developed by quantum chemists for simulating molecules are usually incompatible with those developed by solid - state physicists for bulk bandstructure , making it important to develop a common formalism that addresses both domains of interest and also maintains a good compromise between computational accuracy and practicality .",
    "while sophisticated methods exist for equilibrium geometry and bandstructure , comparable success has yet to be achieved for transport problems , partly because of the lack of universally accepted experimental standards , but mainly because quantum transport inherently involves solving a complicated nonequilibrium open boundary problem for which electronic structure theories are not benchmarked .",
    "a proper quantitative understanding of correlation effects in transport is still evolving and it is not yet clear if mean - field approaches that work at equilibrium are at all capable of handling the profusion of electronic excitations that often dominate in nanoscale conduction.@xcite even aside from such correlation issues , one needs to worry about heterointerfaces since current flow involves charge transport across two intrinsically different material systems  a multimoded contact consisting of a highly conductive material externally maintained at thermal equilibrium , and a sparsely moded device region that is readily driven away from equilibrium and acts as the active transport channel .    in this paper , we employ a semi - empirical approach to electronic structure that can be adopted for electronic conduction through complex hybrid systems by combining it with the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) technique for quantum transport .",
    "our theoretical parameters are tailored to salient features of the bulk bandstructure , while the employment of non - orthogonal basis sets resembling linear combinations of underlying atomic orbitals seems to make them fairly transferrable to surfaces as well , as observed in the past.@xcite in addition , the presence of explicit basis sets opens up the possibility of ` stitching ' together disparate regions@xcite by matching the interfacial green s function , which is the _ only _ quantity through which the diverse regions communicate with each other quantum mechanically .",
    "the modularity of our approach also allows us to conveniently separate the problems of determining the optimized interfacial geometry and the interfacial transmission ( we are ignoring current - induced forces ) , the former depending on the total energy of the system while the latter depends only on a few relevant single - electron levels near the fermi energy . in other words ,",
    "_ given a particular atomistic configuration of the contact - channel - contact heterostructure , we seek to determine its transport properties by coupling our electronic structure approach with quantum transport using negf .",
    "_    the outline of the paper is as follows : section ii explains the strengths of eht over other traditional bandstructure methods . in section iii",
    "we briefly summarize the negf aproach used to calculate density of states and transmission of cnts ; we then specify the model hamiltonian and describe the details of eht used to determine the bandstructure .",
    "the numerically calculated bandstructure data for nanotubes are then compared in section iv with experimental scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments along with other theoretical approaches . in section",
    "v we investigate the changes in the dispersion of a semi - conducting cnt under large lateral deformations as well as with a co molecular attachment to its surface that allows it to function as a molecular sensor .",
    "we summarize our work and discuss future extensions in the last section .",
    "a particular trade - off in any bandstructure theory is between flexibility and rigor .",
    "while empirical , orthogonal tight - binding ( otb ) methods are quick and practical , they are benchmarked for specific geometries and are usually not very transferable to other environments involving significant structural deformations beyond a few percent .",
    "tight binding basis - sets are commonly assumed to be both orthogonal and short - ranged,@xcite while atomic wavefunctions are not , meaning that otb basis sets do not resemble eigenstates of an atomic hamiltonian .",
    "efforts at improving tight - binding theories involve going beyond nearest neighbor techniques , using higher virtual orbital bases for increased completeness,@xcite and employing power laws for parameter transfer under small ( @xmath0 ) strain.@xcite nevertheless these models are likely to miss important chemical details involving properties varying on an interatomic length scale , in particular near deformed surfaces and interfaces where a drastic reconstruction of the atomic structure is expected.@xcite    at the other end of the spectrum are accurate , but computationally expensive first - principles techniques developed by quantum chemists and solid state physicists , such as configuration interaction ( ci ) and density functional theories ( dft ) in various atomic or plane wave basis sets or combinations thereof .",
    "structural deformations are naturally captured by such total energy calculations by solving a one electron schrdinger equation in a suitable self - consistent potential approximating the electron - electron interaction.@xcite such codes are typically based on rigorous variational theorems and are quantitatively quite accurate , at least for equilibrium properties .",
    "their extension and practical implementation to transport beyond the linear response regime is continuously evolving,@xcite and a topic of current research.@xcite conceptually , it is not clear if any self - consistent potential approach can quantitatively describe the rich spectrum of many - body transitions that are often experimentally accessed in strongly correlated transport in weakly coupled systems.@xcite    we aim for a practical compromise between these two limits by using a semi - empirical technique motivated by extended - hckel calculations popular in the chemistry community .",
    "such theories , widely used in the past to describe the equilibrium properties of isolated molecules,@xcite have recently been applied to molecular conduction @xcite and also extended to solids using transferable atomic - orbital basis sets ( ao ) for calculating the electronic structure of various compounds benchmarked with detailed dft calculations within the local density ( lda ) or generalized gradient ( gga ) approximations.@xcite given a geometry , one uses the explicit eht basis functions to calculate a non - orthogonal overlap matrix @xmath1 , which along with separately fitted onsite hamiltonian matrix elements yields the corresponding off - diagonal hopping elements of the hamiltonian . within the standard hckel prescription ,",
    "structural changes are simply accounted for by re - calculating the overlap and hopping elements , but leaving the basis sets and onsite elements unchanged .    in the following",
    ", we apply this eht parametrization scheme@xcite by benchmarking it to a two - dimensional graphene sheet@xcite and extending it to obtain the bandstructure , density of states and electronic transmission of carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) of varying chiralities .",
    "we show that the same bulk - optimized eht - parameters ( onsite energies and ao - basis functions ) are transferable to small diameter cnt bandstructures , capturing even curvature - induced bandgap effects for larger than @xmath2 tube deformation , in quantitative agreement with sts data .",
    "furthermore , surface chemical effects are examined through the study of nanotube based carbon - monoxide sensors whose alteration of electronic structure upon molecular adsorption compares favorably with ab - initio calculations of da silva _",
    "et al._.@xcite in our follow - up paper , we will demonstrate a similar transferability between bulk silicon , various silicon surfaces , apply the eht - methodology to unreconstructed silicon nanowires .",
    "taken together , the wide variety of these examples illustrates the range of transferability of eht parameters , which we believe makes extended hckel theory a useful practical tool for electronic structure and quantum transport .",
    "simulating conduction through a heterostructure involves combining suitable bandstructures for the channel and contact materials with self - consistent electrostatics and quantum transport .",
    "while the formulation of correlated transport is itself an active area of research , our aim here is to develop a minimal model that would capture quantum chemistry , surface physics , bandstructure and electrostatic effects that are all crucial for different prominent aspects of nanoscale conduction .",
    "the ingredients needed for a proper simulation are the hamiltonian and potential matrices describing the device bandstructure and electrostatics , and the contact self - energies that effectively open up the system and allow us to add or remove charge under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "the eht prescription gives us a practical way to calculate these ingredient matrices for a given atomistic structure , and then connect them with a non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formulation of quantum transport , which we briefly summarize below.@xcite the retarded green function of the device is given by @xmath3^{-1}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath4 describe the overlap and hamiltonian matrices of the device unit cell calculated according to the hckel prescription eq.([eht_rule ] ) .",

    "the size of the overlap and hamiltonian matrices are determined by the chosen basis set , i.e. , the number of atoms within the unit cell multiplied by the number of orbitals per atom . in our case , using four @xmath18-orbitals per atom , the size of these matrices is @xmath19 for an armchair @xmath20 tube as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig_3dtubestructure ] .",

    "the real - space matrix elements @xmath30 , between an atom @xmath31 in the reference unit cell and atom @xmath27 in cell @xmath25 are calculated by means of the extended hckel prescription .",
    "= 2.75 in    perhaps the most prominent difference between the empirical tight - binding and eht principle is the use of an irreducible representation of the tight - binding hamiltonian which is directly fitted to available bandstructure data without employing explicit basis sets . in eht",
    "however one works directly with the orbital basis functions out of which the hamiltonian elements are constructed using the hckel principle .",
    "the diagonal elements are benchmarked with experimental values of electronic ` hardness ' , i.e. the difference between ionization potential and electron affinity.@xcite the off - diagonal matrix elements are then determined directly from the prescription @xmath32 where @xmath33 label the atomic orbitals , and @xmath34 is the overlap matrix between the orbital basis function @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "the individual orbital wavefunctions @xmath47 are then approximated by a linear combination of stos , with coefficients and exponents @xmath48 fitted for the individual basis functions to match bandstructure data .",
    "since the basis sets are directly fitted to experimental or theoretical data , the resulting aos are more localized than the free atomic wavefunctions , although they may still be regarded as long - ranged compared to the usual tb wannier - like description ; we typically use a cut - off interatomic distance of @xmath49   for the interactions .",
    "the use of basis function that are not too localized turns out to be a key issue for achieving a good transferability.@xcite admittedly , the use of a direction independent @xmath37 function is a drastic assumption that can be relaxed by making the constant orbital dependent , but we make the simplifying assumption that the orientation dependence arises principally from the corresponding overlap functionals .    the hckel prescription eq .",
    "( [ eht_rule ] ) can be generalized to connect different chemical sub - systems @xmath50 .",
    "the problem is that each sub - system has its own parametrization that yields its own vacuum level relative to which electronic levels are calculated .",
    "for instance , the fermi level of most metals is set to @xmath51 ev in the paper in,@xcite which means that each dispersion curve needs to be individually shifted to bring its fermi level upto the experimental value , through the transformation @xmath52 for each sub - system .",
    "the correct alignment of the levels relative to each other becomes particularly important when studying compound systems such as metal - semiconductor junctions or molecular components attached on nanowires and nanotubes .",

    "it is worth noting that this approach provides a simple interpolation scheme that gives us the correct limiting values of the hamiltonian for the two individual subsystems .",
    "further work , however , clearly needs to be done to calibrate this interpolation scheme to specific interfacial properties such as measured charge transfer doping , schottky barrier heights , or perhaps first principles calculations of interfacial dipoles or chemisorption properties such as workfunction modification at surfaces .",
