    "one of the most important new physical insights given in einstein s seminal paper on special relativity ( sr )  @xcite was the realisation that the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction ( lfc ) , which had previously been interpreted by lorentz and poincar as an electrodynamical effect , was most easily understood as a simple consequence of the space - time lorentz transformation ( lt ) , i.e. as a geometrical effect  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out 54 years later by terrell  @xcite and penrose  @xcite that when other important physical effects ( light propagation time delays and optical aberration ) are taken into account , as well as the lt , the moving sphere considered by einstein in the 1905 sr paper would not appear to be flattened , in the direction of motion , into an ellipsoid , as suggested by einstein , but rather would appear undistorted , but rotated . shortly afterwards",
    ", weinstein  @xcite pointed out that the lfc of a moving rod is apparent only if it is viewed in a direction strictly perpendicular to its direction of motion .",
    "it appears instead to be relatively elongated if moving towards the observer , and to be more contracted than the lfc effect if moving away from him .",
    "these effects are a consequence of light propagation time delays .",
    "a review  @xcite has discussed in some detail the combined effects of the lt , light propagation delays and optical aberration on the appearence of moving objects and clocks .",
    "another paper by the present author  @xcite pointed out that , in addition to the well - known lfc and time dilatation ( td ) effects corresponding , respectively , to @xmath0 and @xmath1 projections of the lt , two other apparent distortions of space - time may be considered : time contraction ( tc ) and space dilatation ( sd ) corresponding to the two remaining projections , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , of the lt .",
    ", @xmath4 ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 are measured in two inertial frames , s ; s in relative motion along their common @xmath7-axis ]    the apparent nature of spatial distortions resulting from the lt is made evident by comparing the lfc with sd . in the former case",
    "the moving object appears shorter , in the latter longer , than the length as observed in its proper frame .",
    "similarly , in td , a moving clock appears to run slower than a similar clock at rest , while in tc identical moving clocks observed at a fixed position appear to be running faster than a similar , stationary , clock .",
    "a dynamical explanation has been proposed  @xcite for the lfc effect in the case of an extended object bound by electromagnetic forces , and of td  @xcite in the case of various ` electromagnetic clocks ' .",
    "no attempt has been made , to date , to find a dynamical explanation of the tc and sd effects .",
    "it is hard to see , in any case , how any ` dynamical ' explanation can be given for the lfc of the proper distance between two isolated material objects in a common inertial frame , whereas , as first shown by einstein , this is a simple space - time geometric consequence of the lt . as will be discussed below , one important reason for the misinterpretation of the ` rockets - and string paradox '  @xcite is the incorrect assumption that extended objects undergo a ` dynamical ' lfc that is different from that of the distance between two discrete objects .    the ` rockets - and - string ' and ` pole - and - barn '  @xcite as well as the similar ` man - and - grid '  @xcite and ` rod - and - hole '  @xcite paradoxes have all been extensively used in text books on sr , for example in taylor and wheeler  @xcite and , more recently , by tipler and lewellyn  @xcite . in all cases the apparent lfc effects",
    "are correctly derived from the lt equations , but it seems to be nowhere realised that the ` real ' positions and size of moving objects , in the sense that will be described below in section 2 , are different from the apparent ones derived from the lt .",
    "indeed , the general assumption , in all of the papers and books just cited seems to be that there is no distinction between the real and apparent sizes and positions of moving objects , or , equivalently , that the lfc is a ` real ' effect .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to point out that this is not the case and that the ` real ' and ` apparent ' ( i.e. , those calculated using the lt ) positions of moving objects are , indeed , distinct .",
    "the origin of this confusion between ` real ' and ` apparent ' positions and sizes of moving objects is not clear to the author .",
    "there is nothing in einstein s 1905 sr paper to suggest that the lfc should be considered as a ` real ' rather than an ` apparent ' effect .",
    "specifically , einstein wrote  @xcite :    thus , whereas the x and z dimensions of the sphere ( and therefore every rigid body of no matter what form ) do not appear modified by the motion , the x dimension appears shortened in the ratio @xmath8 , i.e. the greater the value of @xmath9 the greater the shortening .",
    "in the original german the crucial phrase is : ` erscheint die x - dimension i m verhltnis @xmath10 ' .",
    "the verb ` erscheinen ' , translated into english  @xcite means ` to appear ' .",
    "einstein never stated , in reference  @xcite , that the lfc is a ` real ' effect .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : the following section discusses the real positions of objects as observed or measured in a single reference frame .",
    "section 3 describes the apparent spatial positions of objects in uniform motion as predicted by the lt .",
    "the rockets - and - string and barn - and - pole paradoxes are discussed in sections 4 and 5 respectively . in section 6 ,",
    "the close connection between the lfc and the relativity of simultaneity of sr is described and a new paradox of sr is pointed out .",
    "section 7 contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "the ` real ' positions of one or more moving objects are defined here as those specified , for the different objects , in a single frame of reference .",
    "the latter may be either inertial , or with an arbitary accelerated motion . by introducing the concept of a co - moving inertial frame , at any instant of the accelerated motion",
    ", the distance between the objects can always be defined as the proper distance between them in a certain inertial frame . if this distance in the different co - moving inertial frames is constant the ` real ' distance is said to be constant .",
    "no distinction is made between the real distance between the points on a rigid extended object and that between discrete , physically separated , objects coincident in space - time with these points .",
    "this is because the lt , that relates only space - time events in different inertial frames , treats , in an identical manner , points on extended or discrete physical objects .",
    "the utility of the science of the ` real ' positions of moving objects ( astronomy , railways , military ballistics , air traffic control , space travel , gps satellites ... ) is evident and the validity of the basic physical concepts introduced by galileo ( distance , time , velocity and acceleration ) are not affected , in any way , by sr .",
    "the ` real ' positions of objects in a given reference frame are those which must be known to , for example , avoid collisions between moving objects in the case of railway networks , or , on the contrary , to assure them in the case of military ballistics or space - travel . from now on , in this paper , the words ` real ' and ` apparent ' will be written without quotation marks .    for clarity , a definite measuring procedure to establish the real distance between two moving objects in a given frame of observation",
    "is introduced .",
    "this will be useful later when discussing the barn - and - pole paradox .",
    "suppose that the objects considered move along the positive x - axis of an inertial coordinate system s. the co - moving inertial frame of the objects is denoted by s. it is imagined that two parallel light beams cross the x - axis in s , at right angles , at a distance @xmath11 apart .",
    "each light beam is viewed by a photo - cell and the moving objects are equipped with small opaque screens that block the light beams during the passage of the objects .",
    "two objects , o1 and o2 , with x(o2 ) @xmath12 x(o1 ) , moving with the same uniform velocity , @xmath9 , will then interrupt , in turn , each of the light beams .",
    "suppose that the photo - cells in the forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) beams are equipped with clocks that measure the times of extinction of the beams to be ( in an obvious notation ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "consideration of the motion of the objects past the beams gives the following equations ; @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the real distance between the moving objects .",
    "eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) give the times of passage of the objects o1 and o2 , respectively , between the light beams , whereas eqn(2.3 ) is obtained by noting that , if @xmath19 , each object moves the distance @xmath20 during the interval @xmath21 . if @xmath22 each object moves a distance @xmath23 during the interval @xmath24 and the same equation is obtained . taking the ratios of eqn(2.3 ) to either eqn(2.1 ) or eqn(2.2 ) yields , after some simple algebra , the relations : @xmath25}{t(b1)-t(f1 ) } \\\\",
    "l   & = & \\ell \\frac{[t(f1)-t(f2)]}{t(b2)-t(f2 ) }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subtracting eqn(2.3 ) from eqs(2.1 ) or ( 2.2 ) , respectively , gives : @xmath26 taking the ratios of eqn(2.6 ) to ( 2.2 ) and eqn(2.7 ) to ( 2.1 ) then yields two further equations , similar to ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) above : @xmath25}{t(b2)-t(f2 ) } \\\\",
    "l   & = & \\ell \\frac{[t(f1)-t(f2)]}{t(b1)-t(f1 ) }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( 2.4),(2.5),(2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) show that any three of the four time measurements are sufficient to determine the real separation , @xmath18 , between the two moving objects . in these equations the times : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 and @xmath16 , respectively , are not used to determine @xmath18 . in order to combine all four time measurements to obtain the best , unbiased , determinations of @xmath9 and @xmath18 ,",
    "eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) may be added to obtain : @xmath27 while subtracting two times eqn(2.3 ) from ( 2.10 ) gives : @xmath28 the velocity , @xmath9 , is obtained by transposing eqn(2.10 ) : @xmath29 while the ratio of eqn(2.11 ) to ( 2.10 ) gives : @xmath30}{t(b1)+t(b2)-t(f1)-t(f2)}\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note that the real spatial positions , as well as the instantaneous velocity and acceleration , at any time , of two objects subjected to a symmetric , uniform , acceleration in the frame s , can also be determined from the four time measurements just considered . in this case",
    "there is no redundancy , the time measurements determine four equations which may be solved for the four quantites just mentioned . in the case of uniform motion , the constant velocity hypothesis may be checked by comparing the independent determinations of @xmath9 provided by eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , as already mentioned , any three of the four time measurements is sufficient to determine @xmath18 .",
    "evidently , if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 in the case of an arbitary accelerated motion of the two objects .",
    "thus , by varying @xmath11 , the real distance between the co - moving objects can be determined even if the acceleration program of their co - moving frame is not known .    the two objects , moving with equal and constant velocities along the x - axis in s , discussed above , are now considered to be set in motion by applying identical acceleration programs to two objects initially at rest and lying along the @xmath7-axis in s. the two objects considered are then , by definition , subjected to the same acceleration program in their common rest frame , or , what is the same thing , their common rest frame , ( with respect to which the two objects are , at all times , at rest ) is accelerated .",
    "under these circumstances the distance between the objects remains constant in the instantaneous co - moving inertial frame of the objects . at the start of the acceleration procedure ,",
    "the instantaneous co - moving inertial frame is s , at the end of the acceleration procedure it is s. therefore the separation of the objects in s at the start of the acceleration procedure is the same as that in s at the end of it .",
    "note that there is no distinction between the real and apparent distances for objects at rest in the same inertial frame .",
    "also ` relativity of simultaneity ' can play no role , since the proper time of both objects is always referred to the same co - moving inertial frame . since the acceleration program of both objects starts at the same time in s , and both objects execute identical space time trajectories , the real separation of the objects must also remain constant .",
    "this necessarily follows from space - time geometry .",
    "similarly , since the acceleration program stops at the same time in s for both objects the real separation of the objects remains constant in this frame and equal to the original separation of the objects in s. this behaviour occurs for any symmetric acceleration program , and is shown , for the special case of a constant acceleration in the rest frame of the objects ( to be calculated in detail below ) , in fig 1 . since , in the above discussion , both objects are always referred to the same inertial frame there is no way that sr can enter into the discussion and change any of the above conclusions .",
    "indeed , sr is necessary to derive the correct form of the separate space - time trajectories in s , but the symmetry properties that guarantee the equalites of the real separations of the objects can not be affected , in any way , by sr effects .",
    "two objects , o1 and o2 , originally lying at rest along the x - axis in s and separated by a distance @xmath18 are now simultaneously accelerated , during a fixed time period , @xmath33 , in s , starting at @xmath34 , with constant acceleration , @xmath35 , in their common proper frame , up to a relativistic velocity @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the equations giving the velocity @xmath9 and the position @xmath7 in a fixed inertial frame , using such an acceleration program , were derived by marder  @xcite and more recently by nikolic  @xcite and rindler  @xcite .",
    "the positions and velocities of the objects in the frame s are : for @xmath39 @xmath40 for @xmath41 @xmath42-\\frac{l}{2 } \\\\",
    "x_2(t ) & = & c\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{c^2+a^2t^2}-c}{a}\\right]+\\frac{l}{2 }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath43 @xmath44    the origins of s and s have been chosen to coincide at @xmath45 .",
    "the real positions of the objects in s are shown , as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , in fig.1 .",
    "the velocities of the two objects are equal at all times , as is also the real separation of the objects @xmath48 .",
    "sr is used only to derive eqn(2.17 ) . the time - varying velocity is then integrated according to the usual rules of classical dynamics in order to obtain eqns(2.18),(2.19 ) for the positions of the objects during acceleration .",
    "these are , by definition , the _ real _ positions of the objects o1 and o2 in s. the equalities of the velocities and the constant real separations are a direct consequence of the assumed initial conditions and the similarity of the proper frame accelerations of the objects .",
    "these are the sets of equations that must be used to specify the distance between o1 and o2 and any other objects , whose real positions are specified in s , in order to predict collisions or other space - time interactions of the objects .",
    "in order to account correctly for the actual appearence of moving objects , not only the lt but also the effects of light propagation delays to the observer , and optical aberration must be properly taken into account . in the following",
    ", it is supposed that the necessary corrections for the two latter effects have been made , so that only consequences of the lt are discussed . in this case",
    "the apparent position @xmath49 in a ` stationary ' inertial frame , s , at time is simply the time recorded by a synchronised local clock in s. ] , @xmath4 , of an event at @xmath5 , @xmath6 in the inertial frame , s , moving with velocity @xmath9 along the positive @xmath7-axis in s , is given by the space - time lt : @xmath50 in eqns(3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) , clocks in s and s synchronised so as to record the same time at @xmath51 when @xmath52 .    since ` observation ' implies the interaction , with a detection apparatus , of one or more photons , originating from the observed object , it is convenient to define the space - time events that are related by the lt to correspond , in s , to the points of emission ( or reflection ) of a photon from a source at rest , and in s to the space - time point at which the emission or reflection of this photon is observed .",
    "it is assumed that , after the acceleration procedure described in the previous section , the frame s moves with constant velocity @xmath53 along the x - axis of s. how the object will appear when viewed from s , depends on which photons , scattered from or emitted by the object , are selected by the observer . in the case of the lfc discussed by einstein  @xcite",
    "the observer in s requires that the photons emitted from o1 and o2 are observed simultaneously in s ( the @xmath54 projection of the lt ) .",
    "as is easily derived from eqns(3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) , the separation of the two objects then appears to be @xmath55 where @xmath18 is their real separation in s. another simple possibility  @xcite is to require that the two objects are both illuminated for a very short period of time in their proper frame , yielding a ` transient luminous object ' .",
    "in this case , a quite complicated series of events is observed in s. a line image ( whose width depends on the period of illumination ) is seen to move with velocity @xmath56 in the same direction as that of the moving object , sweeping out a total length @xmath57 .",
    "this is the so - called ` space dilatation ' ( sd ) effect ( the @xmath58 projection of the lt )  @xcite . as discussed in more detail below ,",
    "both the lfc and td effects are direct consequences of the ` relativity of simultaneity ' of sr introduced by einstein . in both lfc and td , the space - time events in s",
    "are associated with the real positions of the objects , as defined above , in this frame .",
    "however , since it is clear that the apparent positions of these space - time events , as observed in s , depend upon the mode of observation , being different for the lfc and td , they evidently can not be identified with the real positions of the objects in this frame .",
    "the relation of the real and apparent positions will now be discussed in detail for the two ` paradoxes ' of sr mentioned above .",
    "the idea that the lfc could induce mechanical stress in a moving extended body was introduced by dewan and beran  @xcite , criticised by nawrocki  @xcite and defended by dewan  @xcite and romain  @xcite .",
    "dewan and beran discussed symmetric acceleration of two rockets , originally at rest in the frame s , in a way very similar to the acceleration of the two objects o1 and o2 described in section 2 above , except that no specific acceleration program was defined .",
    "it was correctly concluded that the real distance between the objects in s would remain unchanged throughout the aceleration procedure .",
    "however , it was not stated that , after acceleration , the proper separation between the rockets is the same as their original separation in s. dewan and beran then introduced a continous string attached between the rockets during the acceleration and drew a distinction between two distances :    \\(a ) the distance between two ends of a connected rod and ( b ) the distance between two objects which are not connected but each of which independently and simultaneously moves with the same velocity with respect to an inertial frame    it was then stated ( without any supporting argument ) that the distance ( a ) is subject to the lfc and ( b ) not . replacing the ` connected rod ' of ( a ) by a continous string attached between the rockets , it was concluded that the string would be stressed and ultimately break , since the distance between the rockets does not change , whereas the string shrinks due to the lfc .",
    "several correct arguments were given why the _ real _ distance between the rockets does not change .",
    "the incorrect conclusion that the string would be stressed and break was due to the failure to discriminate between the _ real _ separation of the rockets ( correctly calculated ) and the _ apparent _ contraction due to the lfc , which as correctly pointed out by nawrocki  @xcite applies equally to the distance between the ends of the string and that between the points on the rockets to which it is attached .",
    "dewan and beran s distinction between the distances ( a ) and ( b ) is then wrong .",
    "both the distance between the points of attachment of the string and the length of the string undergo the same apparent lfc .",
    "there is no stress in the string .",
    "it does not break .",
    "dewan did not respond to nawrocki s objection that ( correctly ) stated the equivalence of the length of an extended object and the distance between two independant objects separated by a distance equal to this length , but instead introduced a new argument , claiming that nawrocki had not correctly taken into account the relativity of simultaneity of sr .",
    "dewan considered the sequence of events corresponding to the firing of the rockets as observed in s , the co - moving frame of the rockets after acceleration .",
    "it was concluded that the spring breaks because , in this case , the final separation of the rockets is @xmath57 ( this is just the sd effect described above ) . but for this , the lt must be applied to space time events on the rockets ( and not to the string ) , whereas when considering an observer in s , dewan and beran had applied the lt to the string ( and not to the rockets ) ! viewed from s",
    "both the distance between the rockets and the length of the string undergo the apparent sd effect , there is no stress in the string and it does not break .",
    "all of the confusion and wrong conclusions in references  @xcite and  @xcite result , firstly , from the failure to notice the strict equivalence of separations of type ( a ) and ( b ) and secondly from not realising that the apparent and real separations of the moving rockets are not the same .",
    "even nawrocki , who correctly pointed out the fallacy of assigning the lfc to separations of type ( a ) but not to type ( b ) seems not to have realised the correctness of dewan and beran s calculation of the real distance between the rockets .",
    "he correctly stated that the apparent contractions of the length of the string and the distance between the rockets would be the same , but did not discriminate this apparent distance from the real separation of the rockets in the frame s.    the acceleration program discussed in section 2 above ( and indeed any programme which is an arbitary function of proper time ) when applied in a symmetrical manner to the two objects o1 and o2 , will leave unchanged the proper separation of the objects in their co - moving frame . on the other hand .",
    "the ` instantaneous ' acceleration considered by dewan apparently resulted in a change in the proper separation of the rockets . if dewan had considered instead a physically realistic acceleration program , such as that discussed in section 2 above ( which must necessarily occupy a finite period of time ) no change in the proper separation of the rockets in their co - moving frame would have been predicted .",
    "this is shown in fig.1b above .",
    "in fact , dewan did not consider the whole acceleration process , but instead calculated the apparent positions in s , according to the lt , of the space - time events corresponding to the firing of the rockets in s , i.e. the start of the acceleration programme .",
    "these apparent positions are not the same as the real positions of the rockets in s. the apparent length of a rod uniformly accelerated in its proper co - moving frame has recently been calculated by nikolic  @xcite .",
    "it was correctly noted in this paper , contrary to the conclusion of dewan , that the real length of the rod remains unchanged in this frame .    in a comment on reference  @xcite , evett and wagness",
    "@xcite stated that the distance between the rockets , given by dewan and beran as that between the tail of the first rocket and the head of the second , would not remain constant in s , due to the lfc of the rockets , whereas the distance between any two corresponding points would , thus , like dewan and beran , evett and wagness assumed that extended material objects ( rockets , strings ) undergo the lfc , but not the spatial separation of the rockets in their co - moving frame .",
    "thus evett and wagness also stated that the string will break .",
    "actually , the real lengths of the rockets as well as the distance between them , in the frame s , remain unchanged during acceleration , but , as correctly stated by nawrocki , they both undergo the apparent lfc .",
    "in section 3 of reference  @xcite dewan considered an observer at rest in the co - moving frame of the accelerated rocket , r2 , with the smallest x - coordinate .",
    "he concluded that , viewed from this frame , the second rocket , r1 , would have a non - vanishing velocity in the x - direction that stresses the string and causes it to break .",
    "such behaviour is clearly in contradiction with the assumed symmetry of the acceleration program . at any instant",
    "the two rockets have a common co - moving frame within which their relative velocity is zero .",
    "dewan s argument was later supported by romain  @xcite who considered a constant acceleration of the rockets in their co - moving proper frame as in eqns.(2.17)-(2.19 ) above .",
    "this conclusion however was founded on a misinterpretation of the space - time diagram ( fig.1 of reference  @xcite ) describing the motion of the rockets . in reference to this figure",
    "it was incorrectly stated that ` @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the same `` proper length '' ' .",
    "in fact , the proper separation of the rockets in the frame s ( with space and time coordinates @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) corresponding to the space - time point @xmath63 , on the trajectory of r2 , in the frame s ( with space and time coordinates @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) is represented by the distance between @xmath63 and the intersection of the @xmath61 axis with the tangent to the trajectory of r1 at @xmath66 ( say , the point @xmath67 ) not @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is the distance between @xmath63 and the intersection of the @xmath61 axis with the trajectory of r1 .",
    "the apparent distance in s corresponding to the segment @xmath68 ( a @xmath69 projection ) is found to be @xmath70 so that , from the sd effect described in section 3 above , the proper separation of the rockets in s is @xmath71 , i.e. the same as their initial separation in s. thus it is the segment @xmath68 , not @xmath59 , that represents the same proper length as @xmath60 . since the velocity in s of r1 at @xmath72 is greater than that of @xmath73 at @xmath63 , romain was lead to the same erroneous conclusion as dewan , that the proper distance between the rockets is increasing , causing the string to break .",
    "it may be noted that this conclusion is actually in contradiction with romain s own ( but incorrect ) statement that @xmath74 and @xmath59 represent the same proper length !",
    "although romain did not discriminate between the real and apparent positions of the rockets , it may be remarked that the trajectories @xmath75 , @xmath76 in fig.1 of reference  @xcite actually represent the real positions of the rockets in s as discussed in section 2 above .",
    "this figure is thus similar to fig.1a of the present paper .",
    "also the distance @xmath68 represents , in s , the constant ( real ) separation of the rockets r1 , r2 in their common co - moving inertial frame .",
    "the apparent positions of the similarly accelerated rockets were later discussed by evett  @xcite .",
    "no distinction was made between the real and apparent positions of the rockets and , unlike romain , no definite acceleration procedure was defined . like dewan , a misinterpretation of the space time events corresponding to the firing of the rockets , as observed from their final inertial frame , lead to the erroneous conclusion that the real separation of the rockets in this frame is different from the initial one before acceleration .",
    "what is essentially the ` rockets - and - string paradox ' has been recently re - discussed by tartaglia and ruggiero  @xcite , although no reference was made , in their paper , to the previous literature on the subject discussed in the present paper . as in section 2 above ,",
    "the case of two objects ( spatially independent or connected by a spring ) , subjected to an idential uniform acceleration in their proper frames , as in section 2 above , was considered , as well as that of an extended object ( rod ) subjected to a similar acceleration program .",
    "no distinction was made between the real and apparent positions of the objects considered , and no calculations using the space - time lt were performed . exactly the same error as that of dewan and beran was made by introducing an incorrect distinction between the spatial interval between the ends of a connected rod and that between two spatially disconnected objects situated at the same spatial positions as the ends of the rod .",
    "thus , it was concluded that the accelerated rod would be length contracted by an amount determined by its instantaneous velocity in s , as well as undergoing mechanical deformation due to elastic stress generated by the accelarating force .",
    "no calculations were performed , or arguments given , to justify this conclusion ; it is simply stated that :    the length seen by o is obtained from @xmath77 projectiong it from the x axis ( the space of o ) to the x axis , i.e. multiplying by @xmath78 , according to the standard lorentz contraction .",
    "thus here , tartaglia and ruggiero were referring to the apparent , not the real , length of the rod . in the case of two",
    "independent , and similarly accelerated , objects , the real trajectories in s were correctly described , as in eqns(2.14)-(2.22 ) above , and it was correctly stated that the separation of the objects remains constant in this frame .",
    "the real separation was , however , confused with the apparent separation between the objects , since it was then stated , again , without any supporting argument or calculation , that :    ..... the proper distance in the frame of the rockets , @xmath79 , has progressively increased during the acceleration so that the lorentz contraction ( @xmath80 ) produces precisely the @xmath81 result .",
    "the general arguments and detailed calculations presented in section 2 above clearly show that this statement is incorrect .",
    "there is no change in the separation of the objects in their co - moving inertial frame during the acceleration procedure . in the case",
    "when the two objects are connected by a spring , tartaglia and ruggiero incorrectly argued that the spring , being an extended object , undergoes lorentz contraction whereas the spatial separation between the objects does not , thus inducing tension in the spring .",
    "it is then argued that :    the consequence will be that the actual acceleration of the front end will be a little bit less than what the engine alone would produce and the acceleration at the rear end will be a little bit more for the same reason . in this way , the proper times of the two engineers will no longer be the same at a given coordinate time and the two world lines of the ends of the spring will no longer be equal hyperbolae ( see figure 2 ) .    since , in fact , there is no distinction for the lt , between the space interval between points on spatially separated objects , or an equal interval between points on a spatially extended object , there is no ` relativistic tension ' , generated in the spring , to give rise to the different accelerations of the two objects as conjectured in reference  @xcite .",
    "since the distances between the ends of the rod , the two spatially separated objects or the two connected objects remain always constant in the co - moving inertial frame , during the acceleration procedure , it follows that in all three cases considered in reference  @xcite , the real distance , in s , between the moving objects ( except for some possible elastic deformation in the case of the accelerated rod ) will be the same as that shown in fig.1 of reference  @xcite .",
    "this figure is similar to fig .",
    "1a of the present paper or fig . 1 of reference  @xcite .",
    "fig . 2 of reference",
    "@xcite is therefore incorrect .",
    "finally , it may be noted that the apparent length of a uniformly accelerated rod has been calculated by nikolic  @xcite .",
    "the result obtained does not agree with the naive generalisation of the lorentz contraction formula as given after eqn(3 ) in reference  @xcite .",
    "_ apparent positions ( in or out of the barn ) of o1 and o2 as viewed in s. the barn is assumed to be slightly longer than the lorentz - contracted distance between o1 and o2 , so that @xmath82 . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the real positions of moving objects within a single frame of reference are calculated by the well - known rules , based on the concepts of spatial position , time , velocity and acceleration , as first clearly set down by galileo .",
    "special relativity which instead relates , via the lt , space - time events in different inertial frames , has no relevance to the calculation of the relative positions of different moving objects in a single reference frame .",
    "the different apparent sizes of extended objects , or distances between discrete objects , predicted by the lt for different modes of observation , e.g. the lfc ( @xmath54 projection ) or sd ( @xmath58 projection ) manifest the truly apparent ( i.e. observation mode dependent ) nature of these phenomena .",
    "the incorrect conclusion concerning the rockets - and - string paradox presented till now in the literature resulted from , on the one hand , a failure to distinguish between the ( correctly calculated ) real positions of the rockets and the apparent nature of the lfc , and on the other , by application of the lfc in an inconsistent manner , either to the string and not to the rocket separation in s , or to the rocket separation , but not to the string , in s. there are no ` stress effects ' specific to sr and so the string does not break .",
    "similarly , all discussions of the pole - and - barn paradox ( and several similar examples cited above ) , in the literature and text books , have assumed that the lfc is a real , not an apparent , effect .",
    "there seems to be no justification for such an assumption in einstein s original work on sr .",
    "when the real positions of the moving objects ( or rod ) in s are properly taken into account it is evident that they can never actually fit into the barn so that the situation depicted in figs.1 and 2 of reference  @xcite represents a physical absurdity .",
    "it is shown that both the lfc and sd effects are direct consequences of the relativity of simultaneity of sr first proposed by einstein . in the case of the lfc ,",
    "what seems to be a true paradox is revealed by this study .",
    "a photon , emitted by a moving object , is predicted , by the lt , to be observed before the moving object has reached the position at which it emits the photon .",
    "essentially the same apparent breakdown of causality as evidenced by ` backwards running clocks ' has been pointed out in a recently published paper  @xcite .",
