    "the problem of violations of the axioms of probability go back to the early 60 s .",
    "@xcite published a work that influenced modern psychology by showing that humans violate the laws of probability theory when making decisions under risk .",
    "the principle that humans were constantly violating is defined by _ the sure thing principle_. it is a concept widely used in game theory and was originally introduced by  @xcite .",
    "this principle is fundamental in bayesian probability theory and states that if one prefers action @xmath0 over @xmath1 under state of the world @xmath2 , and if one also prefers @xmath0 over @xmath1 under the complementary state of the world @xmath2 , then one should always prefer action @xmath0 over @xmath1 even when the state of the world is unspecified .",
    "cognitive psychologists a. tversky and d. khamenman also explored more situations where classical probability theory could not be accommodated in human decisions . in their pioneering work ,  @xcite realised that the beliefs expressed by humans could not follow the rules of boolean logic or classical probability theory , because humans can not process large amounts of data in order to make estimations or judgements .",
    "consequently , the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics , leading to a violation on one of the most important laws in bayesian theory : the law of total probability .    one of the key differences between classical and quantum theories is the way how information is processed .",
    "according to classical decision making , a person changes beliefs at each moment in time , but it can only be in one precise state with respect to some judgement .",
    "so , at each moment , a person is favouring a specific belief .",
    "the process of human inference deterministically either jumps between definite states or stays in a single definite state across time  @xcite .",
    "most computer science , cognitive and decision systems are modelled according to this single path trajectory principle .",
    "figure  [ fig : definite_states ] illustrates this idea .    in quantum information processing , on the other hand , information",
    "( and consequently beliefs ) are modelled via wave functions and therefore they can not be in definite states .",
    "instead , they are in an indefinite quantum state called the @xmath3 state .",
    "that is , all beliefs are occurring on the human mind at the same time .",
    "according to cognitive scientists , this effect is responsible for making people experience uncertainties , ambiguities or even confusion before making a decision . at each moment",
    ", one belief can be more favoured than another , but all beliefs are available at the same time . in this sense ,",
    "quantum theory enables the modelling of the cognitive system as it was a wave moving across time over a state space until a final decision is made . from this superposed state",
    ", uncertainty can produce different waves coming from opposite directions that can crash into each other , causing an interference distribution .",
    "this phenomena can never be obtained in a classical setting .",
    "figure  [ fig : interference ] exemplifies this .",
    "when the final decision is made , then there is no more uncertainty .",
    "the wave collapses into a definite state .",
    "thus , quantum information processing deals with both definite and indefinite states  @xcite .",
    "@xcite were one of the first researchers to test the veracity of savage s principle under human cognition in a gambling game . in their experiment",
    ", participants were asked at each stage to make the decision of whether or not to play a gamble that has an equal chance of winning $ 200 or losing $ 100 .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the experiment .",
    "three conditions were verified :    1 .",
    "participants were informed if they had won the first gamble ; 2 .",
    "participants were informed if they had lost the first gamble ; 3 .",
    "participants did not know the outcome of the first gamble ;     [ fig : two_stage_gambling ]    the two - stage gambling game was one of the first experiments used in order to determine if the sure thing principle would be verified even with people that did not know about the existence of this principle .",
    "the results obtained in  @xcite experiment showed that this principle is constantly being violated and consequently humans do not perform inferences according to the laws of probability theory and boolean logic .    the overall results revealed that participants who knew that they won the first gamble , decided to play again .",
    "participants who knew that they lost the first gamble , also decided to play again . through savage s sure thing principle",
    ", it was expected that the participants would choose to play again , even if they did not know the outcome of the first gamble .",
    "however , the results obtained revealed something different .",
    "if the participants did not know the outcome of the first gamble , then many of them decided not to play the second one .",
    "several researchers replicated this experiment .",
    "the overall results are specified in table  [ tab : game_results ] .",
    "why did the findings reported in table  [ tab : game_results ] generate so much controversy in the scientific community ? because , the data observed is not in accordance with the classical law of total probability . in tversky and shafir s experiment  @xcite , the probability of a participant playing the second gamble , given that the outcome of the first gamble is unknown , @xmath4 , can be computed through the law of total probability :    @xmath5    in equation  [ eq : law_total_prob ] , @xmath6 corresponds to the probability of a player winning the first gamble , given that ( s)he participated on the game in the first place .",
    "@xmath7 is the probability of playing the second gamble , given that it is known that the player won the first one .",
    "@xmath8 corresponds to the probability of losing the first gamble , given that the participant decided to play the game in the first place . and finally , @xmath9 is the probability of a participant playing the second gamble , given that it is known that ( s)he lost the first one .",
    "following the law of total probability in equation  [ eq : law_total_prob ] , the probability of playing the second gamble , given that the player did not know the outcome of the first one , should be between the following values  @xcite :    @xmath10    the findings reported by  @xcite , however , revealed a different relation .",
    "equation  [ eq : relation_observed ] demonstrates that this relation is violating one of the most fundamental laws of bayesian probability theory :    @xmath11    @xcite explained these findings in the following way : when the participants knew that they won , then they had extra house money to play with and decided to play the second round .",
    "if the participants knew that they lost , then they chose to play again with the hope of recovering the lost money .",
    "but , when the participants did not know if they had won or lost the first gamble , then these thoughts , for some reason , did not emerge in their minds and consequently they decided not to play the second gamble .",
    "other works in the literature also replicated this two - stage gambling experiment  @xcite , also reporting similar results to  @xcite .",
    "their results are summarised in table  [ tab : game_results ] .",
    "there have been different works in the literature trying to explain and model this phenomena  @xcite .",
    "although the models in the literature diverge , they all agree in one thing : one can not use classical probability theory to model this phenomena , since the most important rules are being violated .",
    "this two stage gambling game experiment was one of the most important works that motivated the use of different theories outside of classical bayesian theory and boolean logic , more specifically the usage of quantum probability theory .",
    "recent findings in the cognitive psychology literature revealed that humans are constantly violating the law of total probability when making decisions under risk  @xcite .",
    "these researchers also showed that quantum probability theory enables the development of decision models that are able to simulate human decisions . given that most of the systems that are used nowadays are based on bayesian probability theory ,",
    "is it possible to achieve better inference mechanisms in these systems using quantum probability theory ?",
    "for instance , many medical diagnosing systems are based in classical probabilistic graphical models such as bayesian networks .",
    "can one achieve better performances in diagnosing patients using quantum probability ?    generally speaking , a bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph .",
    "there are two main works in the literature that have contributed to the development and understanding of quantum bayesian networks .",
    "one belongs to  @xcite and the other to  @xcite .    in the work of  @xcite",
    ", it is argued that any classical bayesian network can be extended to a quantum one by replacing real probabilities with quantum complex amplitudes .",
    "this means that the factorisation should be performed in the same way as in a classical bayesian network .",
    "one big problem with tucci s work is concerned with the inexistence of any methods to set the phase parameters .",
    "the author states that , one could have infinite quantum bayesian networks representing the same classical bayesian network depending on the values that one chooses to set the parameters .",
    "this requires that one knows _ a priori _ which parameters would lead to the desired solution for each node queried in the network ( which we never know ) .    in the work of  @xcite , the authors argue that , in order to develop a quantum bayesian network , it is required a quantum version of probability distributions , quantum marginal probabilities and quantum conditional probabilities .",
    "the proposed model fails to provide any advantage relatively to the classical models , because it can not take into account interference effects between unobserved random variables . in the end , both models provide no advantages in modelling decision making problems that try to predict decisions that violate the laws of total probability .     [",
    "fig : qbn_example1 ]    in this paper , the core of the proposed bayesian network is based on the psychological findings uncovered in the works of  @xcite and on quantum information processing .",
    "these authors show that , before taking a decision , human thoughts are seen as superposed waves that can interfere with each other , influencing the final decision . in bayesian networks , nodes can either be query variables , evidences or simply unknown .",
    "given that we do not observe the unknown nodes of a bayesian network , since we do not know for sure what values they can take , then what would happen to the inference process if these nodes are put in a representation of a quantum superposition and interfere with each other ( figure  4 ) ? can a better inference process be achieved ?",
    "these are the main research questions that this paper aims at answering .",
    "so far , to the best of our knowledge , there is no previous work in the computer science community that attempts to map these psychological findings into computer science decision making systems , such as bayesian networks .    in order to validate our hypothesis , we performed experiments with well known classical bayesian networks from the literature .",
    "we first create a quantum bayesian network that can accommodate the paradoxical findings in the two - stage gambling game .",
    "we then generalise our quantum bayesian network in order to deal with larger and more complex datasets that are used in the literature : the well known burglar / alarm bayesian network from  @xcite and the lung cancer bayesian network from  @xcite .      before describing the proposed model , we first need to introduce some quantum probability concepts for the understanding of this work . sections  [ sec : probability ] and  [ sec : traj ]",

    "in this section , we describe the main differences between classical theory and quantum probability theory through examples .",
    "the example analyzed concerns jury duty .",
    "suppose you are a juror and you must decide whether a defendant is guilty or innocent .",
    "the following sections describe how the classical and quantum theory evolve in the inference process .",
    "all this analysis is based on the book of  @xcite .      in classical probability theory ,",
    "events are contained in sample spaces .",
    "a sample space @xmath12 corresponds to the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment or random trial  @xcite .",
    "for example , when judging whether a defendant is guilty or innocent , the sample space is given by @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample_space ] presents a diagram showing the sample space of a defendant being guilty or innocent .",
    "+ in quantum probability theory , events are contained in the so called hilbert spaces .",
    "a hilbert space @xmath14 can be viewed as a generalisation and extension of the euclidean space into spaces with any finite or infinite number or dimensions .",
    "it can be see as a vector space of complex numbers and offers the structure of an inner product to enable the measurement of angles and lengths  @xcite .",
    "the space is spanned by a set of orthonormal basis vectors @xmath15 .",
    "together , these vectors form a basis for the space .",
    "figure  [ fig : hilbert_space ] presents a diagram showing the hilbert space of a defendant being guilty or innocent  @xcite .",
    "since a hilbert space enables the usage of complex numbers , then , in order to represent the events @xmath16 and @xmath17 , one would need two dimensions for each event ( one for the real part and another for the imaginary part ) . in quantum theory",
    ", one usually ignores the imaginary component in order to be able to visualise geometrically all vectors in a 2-dimensional space .      in classical probability theory ,",
    "events can be defined by a set of outcomes to which a probability is assigned .",
    "they correspond to a subset of the sample space @xmath12 from which they are contained in .",
    "events can be mutually exclusive and they obey to set theory .",
    "this means that operations such as intersection or union of events are well defined . since they respect set theory , the distributive axiom is also defined between sets . in our example ,",
    "@xmath16 or @xmath17 can be seen as two mutually exclusive events .      .",
    "]    in figure  [ fig : quantum_events ] , the superposition state @xmath18 can be defined as follows .",
    "@xmath20    in equation  [ eq : ampl ] , one might be wondering what the @xmath21 values mean .",
    "they are called @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "they correspond to the amplitudes of a wave and are described by complex numbers .",
    "the @xmath24 term is defined as the phase of the amplitude .",
    "it can be seen as a shift of the wave .",
    "these amplitudes are related to classical probability by taking the squared magnitude of these amplitudes .",
    "this is achieved by multiplying the amplitude with its complex conjugate ( represented by the symbol @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath26    in quantum theory , it is required that the sum of the squared magnitudes of each amplitude equals @xmath27 .",
    "this axiom is called the normalization axiom and corresponds to the classical theory constraint that the probability of all events in a sample space should sum to one .",
    "[ sec : system_state ]    a system state is nothing more than a probability function @xmath29 which maps events into probability numbers , i.e. , positive real numbers between @xmath30 and @xmath27 .    in classical theory",

    "there is a function that is responsible to assign a probability value to the outcome of an event .",
    "if the event corresponds to the sample space , then the system state assigns a probability value of @xmath27 to the event .",
    "if the event is empty , then it assigns a probability of @xmath30 . in our example , if nothing else is told to the juror , then the probability of the defendant being guilty is @xmath31 .",
    "in quantum theory , the probability of a defendant being @xmath16 is given by the squared magnitude of the projection from the superposition state @xmath18 to the subspace containing the observed event @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hilbert_system_state ] shows an example . if nothing is told to the juror about the guiltiness of a defendant , then according to quantum theory , we start with a superposition state @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath32    when someone asks whether the defendant is guilty , then we project the superposition state @xmath18 into the relevant subspace , in this case the @xmath16 subspace @xmath33 , just like shown in figure  [ fig : hilbert_system_state ] .",

    "this is computed in the following way .",
    "@xmath38    since the events @xmath16 and @xmath17 are mutually exclusive , then their intersection is empty , leading to a zero probability value .    in quantum theory ,",
    "the state revision is given by first projecting the superposition state @xmath18 into the subspace representing the observed event .",

    "@xmath40    @xmath41    from the resulting state , we just extract the probability of being innocent by simply squaring the respective probability amplitude .",

    "in order to describe direct dependencies between a set of variables , path diagrams are generally used .",
    "this section shows how to compute quantum probabilities in a markov model using feynman s path rules , just like presented in the work of  @xcite .",
    "consider the diagram represented in figure  [ fig : single_trajectory ] .",
    "the computation of the probability of transiting from an initial state @xmath0 to a final state @xmath43 , transiting from an intermediate state @xmath1 , can be achieved through a classical markov model .",
    "the probability can be computed by making the product of the individual probabilities for each transition , from one state to another , through the usage of conditional probabilities .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : single_trajectory ] , the probability of transiting from state @xmath0 , followed by state @xmath1 and ending in state @xmath43 , that is , @xmath44 , is given by :    @xmath45    in a quantum path diagram model , the computation of the probabilities for a single path trajectory is similar to the classical markov model .",
    "the calculation can be performed using feynman s first rule , which asserts that the probability of a single path trajectory consists in the product of the squared magnitudes of the amplitudes for each transition from one state to the next along the path .",
    "this means that the quantum probability value of a single path trajectory is the same as the classical markov probability for the same path . in equation  [ eq : feynman1 ] and through the rest of this work",
    ", complex probability amplitudes will be represented by the symbol @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47      an indistinguishable path consists in transiting from an initial state @xmath0 to a final state @xmath48 by transiting from multiple possible paths without knowing for certain which path was taken to reach the goal state .",
    "figure  [ fig : multiple_trajectory_unobs ] shows an example of multiple indistinguishable trajectories . in a classical markov model , if one does not observe which path was taken to reach the final state @xmath48 , then one simply computes this probability by summing the individual probabilities of each path .",
    "this is known as the single path principle and is in accordance with the law of total probability .",
    "so , following figure  [ fig : multiple_trajectory_unobs ] , in order to reach state @xmath48 starting in state @xmath0 , one can take the path @xmath49 or the path @xmath50 .",
    "the final probability is given by :    @xmath51    quantum probability theory rejects the single path trajectory principle .",
    "if one does not observe which path was taken to reach the goal state , then one can not assume that one of each possible paths was used . instead , quantum probability argues that , when the path is unobserved , then the goal state can be reached through a superposition of path trajectories .",
    "this is known as feynman s second rule , which states that the amplitude of transiting from an initial state @xmath0 to a final state @xmath48 , taking multiple indistinguishable paths , is given by the sum of all amplitudes for each path .",
    "this rule is in accordance with the law of total amplitude and the probability is computed by taking the squared magnitude of this sum .",

    "it comes from euler s rule : @xmath57 and corresponds to a quantum interference term that does not exist in classical probability theory . section  [ sec : interference ] details how this term is derived .",
    "since the interference term can lead to estimations with values higher than 1 , then it is necessary to normalize this value in order to obtain a probability value .",
    "when the path is observed , quantum probability theory collapses to the classical markov model .",
    "this is know as feynman s third rule and states that the probability amplitude of observed multiple path trajectories corresponds to the sum of the amplitudes of each individual path .",

    ", interference can be regarded as a chain of waves in a superposition state , coming from different directions .",
    "when these waves crash , one can experience a destructive effect ( one wave destroys the other ) or a constructive effect ( one wave merges with another ) . in either case , the final probabilities of each wave is affected .",
    "psychological findings showed that this not only occurs in a microscopic scale ( such as electrons ) , but also occurs at a macroscopic setting  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we show how to derive the interference term by just taking into account well known properties of complex numbers  @xcite .",
    "the interference term can be derived in two different ways : ( 1 ) from the general probability formula of the union of @xmath60 mutually exclusive events and ( 2 ) through the total law of probability .      for simplicity",

    "we follow the same probabilistic paradigm used in traditional bayesian networks . thus , we constrain equation  [ eq : total_law_q_final_norm ] and equation  [ eq : union_qn_norm ] by a normalisation factor @xmath109 that will guarantee that the computed values will always be probabilities lesser or equal than one .",
    "this normalisation factor corresponds to feynman s conjecture  @xcite that an electron can follow any path .",

    "so , the minimum value that the term @xmath121 can have is @xmath30 ( when the cosine achieves its maximum value ) . given that @xmath122 are always positive numbers , then it is straightforward that equation  [ eq : total_law_q_final_norm ] has to be always positive .",
    "a classical bayesian network can be defined by a directed acyclic graph structure in which each node represents a different random variable from a specific domain and each edge represents a direct influence from the source node to the target node .",

    "there are also works that consider that the probabilities in the prisoner s dilemma game correspond to different contexts and these contexts can be incompatible .",
    "the authors argue that the probabilities observed in the prisoner s dilemma game were not classical , but were not quantum either in the sense of traditional quantum mechanics theory .",
    "so the author introduced the quantum - like approach and suggested a new trigonometric interference term  @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed quantum model which incorporated entangled decisions and explained the violations of the sure thing principle through interference effects between intentions . in  @xcite , the authors explored the impact of these violations in economics and analyse the two - stage gambling game and the prisoner s dilemma game under a quantum probabilistic point of view , by proposing a quantum markov model to explain the paradoxical observations in these games .",

    "@xcite also shares a similar opinion that quantum probability can , in fact , provide a new framework to explain several situations in which the laws of probability are violated .",
    "however , they defend that the usage of quantum probability should be more close to its real meaning in quantum mechanics and proposes to explain the phenomena , such as contextually , entanglement , observables and flock spaces .    the work of",
    ",  @xcite has stimulated some discussions on the implications of quantum probability in functional brain networks .",
    "for instance ,  @xcite have discussed the similarities between the vector representations of quantum states with a vector symbolic architecture , which is used to model realistic biological neural models . in this sense , biological neural models",
    "can also incorporate the quantum probabilistic framework and also introduce quantum interference effects , as a mathematical and geometric alternative framework , without taking into account the true meaning that is given these effects under quantum physics .",
    "other authors also support this idea of representing neuronal model using the quantum probabilistic framework  @xcite .",
    "this work was motivated by the preliminary experiments of  @xcite about violations of the classical probability theory on the sure thing principle .",
    "this principle states that if one chooses action @xmath0 over @xmath1 in a state of the world @xmath2 , and if one also chooses action @xmath0 over @xmath1 under the complementary state of the world @xmath2 , then one should always choose action @xmath0 over @xmath1 , even when the state of the world in unspecified . when humans need to make decisions under risk , several heuristics are used , since humans can not process large amounts of data .",
    "these decisions coupled with heuristics lead to violations on the law of total probability .",
    "recent work in cognitive psychology revealed that quantum probability theory provides another method of computing probabilities without falling into the restrictions that classical probability have in modelling cognitive systems of decision making .",
    "quantum probability theory can also be seen as a generalisation of classical probability theory , since it also includes the classical probabilities as a special case ( when the interference term is zero ) .",
    "the main difference between quantum and classical probability lies in the fact that on quantum probability we are constantly updating some beliefs when making a decision , while in classical probability all beliefs are assumed to have a definite value before a decision is made , and this value is the outcome of the decision  @xcite .",
    "the main research question for this work was how could these quantum probabilities affect probabilistic graphical models , such as bayesian networks , since many of nowadays decision making systems are based on such structures ( medical diagnosis , spam filtering , image segmentation , etc ) .    in this work",
    ", we proposed a novel bayesian network for the computer science community based on quantum probabilities .",
    "our method can accommodate puzzling observations that the classical probability failed to explain ( for instance , the two - step gambling game ) .",
    "when the nodes of the proposed bayesian network are represented as a superposition state , then one can look at this state as many waves moving across in different directions .",
    "these waves can crash into each other causing waves to be bigger or to cancel each other .",
    "this is the interference phenomena that the proposed bayesian network offers and that has direct implications when making inferences .",
    "therefore , the proposed network represents and simulates quantum aspects motivated by feynman s path integrals .",
    "experimental results revealed that the proposed quantum bayesian network enables many degrees of freedom in choosing the final outcome of the probabilities . if we had a real scenario , with real observations",
    ", one could use the present model to fit it to the observed data , by simply tuning the parameter @xmath104 .",
    "this parameter can open a door into machine learning approaches .",
    "learning algorithms using the proposed method might produce better prediction models , since the quantum probability amplitudes are able to fully represent real word data . for future work , we intend to explore machine learning algorithms under quantum probabilistic graphical model formalisms .",
    "the overall results also suggested that when the classical probability of some variable is already high , then the quantum probability tends to increase it even more .",
    "when the classical probability is very low , then the proposed model tends to lower it .    when there are many unobserved nodes in the network then the levels of uncertainty are very high .",
    "but , in the opposite scenario , when there are very few unobserved nodes , then the proposed quantum model tends to collapse into its classical counterpart , since the uncertainty levels are very low .",
    "the proposed bayesian network can integrate human thoughts by representing a person s beliefs in an n - dimensional unit length quantum state vector . in the same way ,",
    "the proposed quantum structure is general enough to represent any other context in which there is a need to formalise uncertainty , including prediction problems in data fusion . in the context of bayesian networks",
    ", data fusion is introduced in the work of  @xcite .",
    "the author argues that , just like people , bayesian networks are structures that integrate data from multiple sources of evidence and enable the generation of a coherent interpretation of that data through a reasoning process .",
    "the fusion of all these multiple data sources can be done using bayes theorem .",
    "when a data source is unknown , then the bayes rule is extended in order to sum out all possible values of the probability distribution representing the unknown data source .",
    "the proposed quantum bayesian network takes advantage of these uncertainties by representing them in a superposition state , which enables the fusion of the data sources through quantum interference effects .",
    "these effects produce changes in the final likelihoods of the outcomes and provide a promising way to perform predictions more accurately according to reality .",

    "<S> probabilistic graphical models such as bayesian networks are one of the most powerful structures known by the computer science community for deriving probabilistic inferences . </S>",
    "<S> however , modern cognitive psychology has revealed that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical probability theory , because humans can not process large amounts of data in order to make judgements . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics , leading to violations of the law of total probability . </S>",
    "<S> this means that probabilistic graphical models based on classical probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various aspects of human decision making .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum probability theory was developed in order to accommodate the paradoxical findings that the classical theory could not explain . </S>",
    "<S> recent findings in cognitive psychology revealed that quantum probability can fully describe human decisions in an elegant framework . </S>",
    "<S> their findings suggest that , before taking a decision , human thoughts are seen as superposed waves that can interfere with each other , influencing the final decision .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a new bayesian network based on the psychological findings of cognitive scientists . </S>",
    "<S> we made experiments with two very well known bayesian networks from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained revealed that the quantum like bayesian network can affect drastically the probabilistic inferences , specially when the levels of uncertainty of the network are very high ( no pieces of evidence observed ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the levels of uncertainty are very low , then the proposed quantum like network collapses to its classical counterpart . </S>"
