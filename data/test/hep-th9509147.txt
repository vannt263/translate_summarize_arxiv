    "in a previous paper @xcite , we presented a method for reducing a general quadratic theory of gravitation to a canonical second - order form .",
    "the quadratic action provides an example of a higher - derivative theory , where the gravitational equations of motion are higher than second order .",
    "this means that the theory contains more degrees of freedom than just the simple massless graviton . by rewriting the action",
    ", we showed that quadratic gravitation is classically equivalent to einstein s gravity coupled to a massive real scalar field and a massive symmetric tensor field describing a spin - two field , with a specific lagrangian .",
    "we found that , even for simple quadratic gravity , the reduced action gave highly non - trivial potential energy and kinetic coupling terms .",
    "this suggests that higher - derivative theories have a great deal of structure , not immediately apparent from a simple linear analysis where one expands around flat space .",
    "one particular feature , which is the main thesis of this paper , is that the transformed theory may have a complicated vacuum structure . here , by a vacuum solution , we mean a stable solution of the second - order theory .",
    "in this paper , we will only consider vacua in which the auxiliary fields are covariantly constant .",
    "it is important to note that only once the vacuum of the transformed theory has been identified can the nature of the elementary field excitations be discussed .",
    "thus , for instance , the exact mass and couplings of the excitations , as well as which excitations are potentially ghost - like , may be very different around different vacuum states .",
    "in general , they will bear little relation to the excitations of the linearized analysis .",
    "the vacuum structure of the quadratic theories remained comparatively simple .",
    "the only stable vacuum was flat space with zero vacuum expectation value for both of the auxiliary fields .",
    "the elementary excitations were a massive scalar field and a massive ghost - like spin - two field .",
    "we would like to investigate how other higher - derivative theories can introduce a more interesting vacuum structure .",
    "a natural generalization is to consider actions which are not quadratic but general functions of the curvature tensors .",
    "since these tensors involve only second derivatives of the metric , the corresponding field equations can be at most fourth - order ; that is , the same order as the quadratic actions",
    ". we can start by asking how many new degrees of freedom we expect in such theories . to give a rough count",
    ", we turn to the cauchy problem . first recall that even higher - derivative gravity theories remain diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "thus we are always able to transform away four components of the symmetric metric , leaving six free components .",
    "since the field equations are fourth - order , if the cauchy problem can be solved we expect to be required to give four initial conditions for each independent component of the metric , namely the component itself and the first three time derivatives . this would imply that we have at most twelve degrees of freedom .",
    "rewriting the theory in a second - order form , since the auxiliary fields are set equal to terms involving second derivatives of the metric , we expect that giving the initial conditions of the auxiliary fields is equivalent to fixing second and third derivatives of the metric , a total of twelve conditions .",
    "thus we find that the auxiliary fields should carry six degrees of freedom , just as in the general quadratic theory .",
    "this leaves a possible six further degrees of freedom in the metric .",
    "however , since the metric in the second - order theory obeys einstein gravity , the number of degrees of freedom is reduced to the two helicity states of the usual massless graviton . by this rough argument",
    ", we expect an action in the form of any general function of the curvature tensors to describe , at most , the propagation of a massless graviton plus an additional six degrees of freedom ; that is , the same as for the special case of the general quadratic theory discussed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "be this as it may , the structure of such theories is potentially much richer than in the quadratic case . as we will see , the vacuum structure is now non - trivial .",
    "a second generalization is to consider gravity actions which have higher derivatives acting on the curvature tensors .",
    "since these theories involve more than two derivatives on the metric , the corresponding field equations will be generically higher than fourth - order .",
    "consequently , we now expect new degrees of freedom in addition to those of the general fourth - order theory .",
    "again , we will show that the vacuum structure of such theories is , in general , non - trivial .",
    "some discussion of reducing both types of generalized theories to a second - order form already exists in the literature . that the equations of motion following from actions given by a general function @xmath1 are equivalent to the equations of motion of a scalar field dilatonically coupled to gravity , was first shown by teyssandier and tourrenc  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence at the level of the action was given by magnano _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who also rewrote the reduce theory in canonical form .",
    "this latter group and jakubiec and kijowski  @xcite also rewrote actions given by a general function @xmath2 in second - order form , though without the canonical separation of the new degrees of freedom .",
    "actions including derivatives of the scalar curvature were considered in the context of inflation by gottlber _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who again showed , in some special cases , the equivalence of the field equations to those describing scalar fields coupled to gravity . still at the level of the field equations , this work was extended to a general class of actions by schmidt  @xcite and wands  @xcite .",
    "possible vacua of the @xmath1 theory are discussed , in terms of the original higher - derivative field equations , by barrow and ottewill  @xcite , and later in terms of the second - order field equations by barrow and cotsakis  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next three section",
    "we will consider actions which are general functions first of the curvature scalar only , then of the ricci tensor , and finally of the full riemann tensor .",
    "rewriting these theories in a canonical second - order form , we will find a rich vacuum structure .",
    "this will require a careful discussion of the different `` branches '' of the theory , a concept we define below",
    ". we will show that the vacuum states are in a one - to - one correspondence with the stable , constant curvature , desitter or anti - desitter solutions of the higher - derivative theory .",
    "furthermore , we will show that if the vacuum of the transformed theory has zero cosmological constant , then the corresponding spacetime for the original higher - derivative theory is also flat .",
    "we will then discuss the elementary excitations around a given vacuum and argue that they remain a graviton , a scalar field and a ghost - like spin - two field , with masses and couplings depending on the particular vacuum and the functional form of the original action . in section [ fboxr ]",
    "we will consider a class of gravity actions that are general functions of the curvature scalar @xmath3 and the derivatives @xmath0 , with @xmath4 a positive integer .",
    "we show how to rewrite such theories in second - order form and show that they have , in general , a non - trivial vacuum structure . in particular , we present an example with two new scalar degrees of freedom , neither of which is ghost - like , coupled to einstein gravity with a stable anti - desitter space as its vacuum .",
    "we briefly present our conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .    throughout the paper our conventions are to use a metric of signature @xmath5 and define the ricci tensor as @xmath6 .",
    "as in the case of quadratic gravity , the higher - derivative theory described by actions which are general functions of the curvature scalar is classically completely equivalent to the canonical second - order theory of a scalar field coupled to gravity .",
    "this equivalence was first shown at the level of the action by magnano _",
    "et al . _",
    "we shall derive this equivalent theory in a slightly different form , by first introducing an auxiliary field to reduce the action to second order and then making a suitable conformal transformation .",
    "we will point out the need to consider different branches of the theory when making the reduction .",
    "we introduce the auxiliary field in two steps .",
    "first we write @xmath7 } , \\label{f(r)s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 .",
    "the auxiliary field @xmath9 has the equation of motion @xmath10 provided we have @xmath11 , this gives @xmath12 .",
    "substituting back into the action we return to the original higher - derivative form .",
    "thus , the reduced action is equivalent to the original theory , but only away from the critical points defined by @xmath13",
    ". a continuous region of @xmath9 between critical points , where @xmath14 never vanishes , will be called a branch .",
    "typically , there will be several branches in the theory .",
    "since @xmath9 gets set equal to @xmath3 , in terms of the original theory , the condition for a critical point can be written @xmath15 .",
    "thus , branches in @xmath9 correspond to branches in @xmath3 in the original higher - derivative theory .    as a concrete example , let us assume that @xmath16 where @xmath17 . solving @xmath13 implies that there is a single critical point at @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the second - order formalism in terms of the auxiliary field @xmath9 is valid in each of the two branches @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but breaks down at the critical point @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath9 gets set equal to @xmath3 , these regions correspond to branches in the space of curvature given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 with a critical point at @xmath23 .",
    "the second step , which will then allow us to rewrite the action in canonical form , is to change variables to a new field @xmath24 . in terms of this new variable ,",
    "the action becomes @xmath25 } .\\ ] ] clearly this action is well defined only for those regions where the @xmath9 action is valid ; that is , away from the critical points .",
    "therefore , the @xmath26 formulation is only defined over ranges of @xmath9 for which @xmath11 .",
    "note that to define the action we must be able to invert the expression @xmath27 to give @xmath28 .",
    "locally this requires the same non - degenerate condition @xmath11 .",
    "globally , there may still be many different roots when we solve for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "however , in any given branch of @xmath9 there is only a single root .",
    "thus there is a valid formulation of the theory in terms of @xmath26 for each branch of @xmath9 .",
    "it is important to note that , in each branch , the inverted function @xmath29 which enters is different .    as a concrete example , consider once again @xmath1 defined in .",
    "it follows that @xmath30 note that @xmath31 .",
    "this expression can be inverted to give @xmath32 clearly one must take the @xmath33 root in the @xmath20 branch and the @xmath34 root in the @xmath19 branch .",
    "this situation is quite generic , as we will see below .    for a particular reduced theory , corresponding to a given branch of the original higher - derivative theory , we can define @xmath35 and perform the conformal transformation @xmath36 .",
    "action then becomes , @xmath37 } .\\ ] ] as promised , we find a theory of einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a particular potential dependent on the choice of the original function @xmath1 . as in the quadratic case",
    "there is one subtlety in defining @xmath38 . to keep @xmath38 real",
    ", we must have @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath40 we must introduce , instead , the field @xmath41 , the effect of which is to change the sign of the overall normalization of the action as compared with the form given in above .",
    "further , at the special point @xmath42 the action can not be put in canonical form . in this paper",
    "we will restrict our attention to the @xmath43 case only .    as a concrete example , consider @xmath1 defined in . as pointed out above , in this case @xmath31 in either branch of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 is always well defined .",
    "we point out , however , that the range of @xmath38 is restricted to @xmath44 .",
    "note that the scalar field kinetic energy has the usual sign and , hence , @xmath38 is not a ghost .",
    "we can now look for the vacua in any given branch of the theory .",
    "the vacua of the theory described by action are defined to be stable solutions of the @xmath45 and @xmath38 equations of motion given by @xmath46 -            \\tfrac32{\\overline g}_{\\mu\\nu}v(\\chi ) \\\\",
    "\\label{canr2chieom }     { \\overline \\nabla}^2\\chi = \\frac{dv}{d\\chi } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] respectively , where the potential is given by @xmath47 where we recall that the form of @xmath48 depends on the branch in question .",
    "as stated previously , we will only consider vacua satisfying the covariant constant condition @xmath49 it follows that @xmath38 is a constant and , from , that it must extremize the potential .",
    "furthermore , it follows from that the vacuum is a space of constant curvature with @xmath50 since @xmath51 and @xmath38 is constant , these vacua also correspond to spaces of constant curvature with respect to the original metric , with @xmath52 .",
    "since the vacuum field @xmath38 must be an extremum of the potential , we have the condition @xmath53 we started with a completely general function @xmath54 , so this condition may generically have multiple solutions , including solutions away from @xmath55 .",
    "further , given a particular solution for @xmath38 , the value of the potential at this point need not be zero ; that is , the vacuum generally has non - zero cosmological constant . in this case , the curvature scalars @xmath3 and @xmath56 will be non - vanishing .    as a concrete example of all this",
    ", we return to the example specified in . as discussed previously , there are two branches where the second order theory is defined ; branch a where @xmath20 and branch b where @xmath19 .",
    "the field @xmath57 , which is given as a function of @xmath9 in , satisfies @xmath31 everywhere and , hence , @xmath58 is well defined in both branches , although its range in restricted to @xmath44 .",
    "expression was inverted to give @xmath9 as a function of @xmath57 in .",
    "this expression is branch dependent , being given by @xmath59 with the positive root chosen in branch a and the negative root chosen in branch b. it follows that the form of the potential energy defined in also depends on the branch chosen .",
    "it is given by @xmath60 for branch a and b respectively .",
    "the two potentials are plotted in figures [ fig : r3vp ] and [ fig : r3vm ] .",
    "we see that each has a stationary point .",
    "however , since vacua must be minima of the potential , it follows that only branch b has a stable vacuum .",
    "this is located at @xmath61 , which is non - zero .",
    "note that @xmath62 , so that the vacuum state has a non - vanishing negative cosmological constant .",
    "it follows that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which implies that the vacuum state is an anti - de sitter space both in terms of the metric @xmath45 and the metric @xmath65 .",
    "thus we have given an example of a higher - derivative theory which has a new vacuum state away from the flat - space solution of ordinary einstein gravity .",
    "it is important to note that none of this structure would have been evident if we had made a simple expansion of the original action around flat space in terms of @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , keeping only the first non - trivial , quadratic terms in @xmath67 , we would not even have been aware that there was an additional scalar degree of freedom in the theory .",
    "the lowest order term in @xmath68 is cubic in @xmath67 , and so in a quadratic expansion we would only see the usual einstein term .",
    "the conclusion is that generic higher - derivative corrections to pure einstein gravity introduce completely new vacuum states into the theory .",
    "flat space is no longer a unique point in field space , so that if , for instance , we wish to investigate the fundamental excitations in the theory , we must start by specifying which vacuum state we are considering .    at this point",
    ", we would like to present another specific example that further illustrates the preceding discussion .",
    "consider the cubic function @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "we now have @xmath71 so that the theory has a single critical point at @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that the second - order theory is defined on two branches ; branch a where @xmath73 and branch b where @xmath74 .",
    "on either branch we can define a new field @xmath24 , which in this case is given by @xmath75 note that , since @xmath76 , @xmath57 is always a positive real number in the range @xmath77 for both branches .",
    "expression can be inverted to give @xmath78 clearly the @xmath79 solution is correct on branch a whereas the @xmath80 solution is to be used in branch b. since @xmath57 is always positive , the definition of @xmath81 is valid in both branches .",
    "note that @xmath38 is then restricted to lie in the range @xmath82 .",
    "since the expression for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath57 , and hence @xmath38 , given in is different in each branch , it follows from that the potential energy function also is different in each branch .",
    "we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 and the @xmath85 expression is valid in branch a and the @xmath86 expression valid in branch b. the two potentials are plotted in figures [ fig : r3genvp ] and [ fig : r3genvm ] . unlike the previous example , in this case each branch contains a single , stable minimum . in branch",
    "a , this minimum is located at @xmath55 and has vanishing cosmological constant @xmath87 .",
    "it follows that , for this vacuum , @xmath88 and spacetime is flat with respect to both the @xmath45 and @xmath65 metrics . in branch b",
    ", the minimum is located at @xmath89 with a non - vanishing negative cosmological constant given by @xmath90 .",
    "for this vacuum @xmath91 and , hence , @xmath64 .",
    "it follows that the spacetime is an anti de - sitter space with respect to both metrics @xmath45 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus we have found an example which , aside from a conventional minimum at @xmath23 with zero cosmological constant , has an additional minimum with negative cosmological constant .",
    "furthermore , there is an unstable maximum with positive cosmological constant .",
    "the mass of the scalar field is different at each of the different minima . here",
    "a quadratic expansion of the action around flat - space would have identified a new scalar degree of freedom , but would never have revealed the presence of a second stable vacuum state .",
    "it will not have escaped the readers notice that finding the vacua in the second - order formalism requires a careful discussion of the branches in the @xmath9 variable .",
    "the branching structure was not too difficult in the preceding examples , but as we will show below , it can be , and generally is , extremely complicated .",
    "however , the following remarks will allow us to define a simpler procedure for determining the vacua .",
    "recall that , for a covariantly constant scalar @xmath38 satisfying @xmath92 , the corresponding spacetime structure in terms of the metric @xmath65 is that of a space of constant curvature with @xmath93 .",
    "provided we are not at a degenerate point , spaces of constant curvature @xmath3 and vacuum solutions are in one - to - one correspondence , since the relation @xmath93 not only means that constant @xmath38 implies constant @xmath3 , but also the reverse .",
    "note that , as a corollary , any vacuum solution with zero cosmological constant , namely @xmath94 , must correspond to flat space in the original higher - derivative theory",
    ". an important consequence of this result is that , since flat space is a single point in the field space of the original theory , there can be only one vacuum state with zero cosmological constant in the second - order theory .",
    "we conclude that all vacuum solutions of the above type can be found as constant curvature solutions of the equations of motion for the higher - derivative @xmath65 theory .",
    "all such vacua can be found directly , without reference to any branch structure .",
    "having found a vacuum of interest , one can then proceed in reverse , introducing the second - order theory in the appropriate branch containing that vacuum .",
    "this is often an easier procedure .",
    "the @xmath65 equations derived from the higher - derivative action are @xmath95 if we look for solutions of constant curvature , then @xmath96 where @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "it follows that the derivative terms in the equations of motion drop out and we are left with the simple condition , first derived by barrow and ottewill  @xcite , @xmath97 we see that this is exactly the condition we obtained for stationary points of the potential aside from a factor of @xmath98 . in the latter case",
    ", however , the expression was taken to be a function of the scalar field @xmath38 expressed in terms of @xmath9 , and as such only valid in a branch - by - branch sense , whereas here the expression is valid for all curvature @xmath3 .",
    "this now provides us with a procedure for finding all the vacua of the theory as well as the nature of the excitations around a given vacuum .",
    "we start by looking for constant curvature solutions of the original higher - derivative equations of motion , solving the equation , which is valid globally . having identified these points we can then , locally around each solution , make a transformation to the reduced theory , choosing , if necessary , the appropriate branch of @xmath48 . in the transformed frame , the new scalar degree of freedom",
    "is made explicit .",
    "we can then address questions of local stability and the mass of the scalar field .",
    "the only breakdown of this procedure occurs when the minimum is at a degenerate point of the transformation ; that is , a point where @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", any discussion of the particle spectrum and local stability must be in terms of the original theory .",
    "in general , we shall not consider such degenerate points .",
    "as an example of this procedure , consider the function @xmath99.\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is a constant .",
    "the condition for a degenerate point is then @xmath101 this equation has solutions @xmath102 where @xmath103 is any integer .",
    "the theory thus has an infinite number of branches given by @xmath104 . rather than treating each branch separately , we follow our procedure for finding the vacuum states of the theory by solving the condition for the constant curvature solutions of the original theory .",
    "the condition reads @xmath105 = 0.\\ ] ] the left - hand side of this expression is plotted in figure [ fig : constrex ] .",
    "we have the solutions @xmath106 where @xmath103 is an integer and @xmath107 are the solutions of @xmath108 explicitly , the first few solutions of near @xmath109 are @xmath110 furthermore @xmath111 and as @xmath112 becomes large the solutions approach @xmath113 .",
    "the first observation to make is that the constant curvature solutions at @xmath114 , including the point @xmath23 , all correspond to degenerate points . as such",
    ", a second - order form of the theory does not exist at these points .",
    "thus , although these are constant curvature solutions , we can not identify them as vacuum solutions of a canonical second - order theory .",
    "however the solutions at @xmath115 are not at degenerate points . from our previous discussion",
    "this implies that they must correspond to vacuum solutions of the canonical second - order theory .",
    "nonetheless , we find that each vacuum solution lies in a different branch of the theory .",
    "let us consider two particular solutions , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , in the second - order formulation .",
    "for the first solution we must take the branch @xmath118 .",
    "following our usual procedure for writing the theory in a second - order form , we first introduce the auxiliary field @xmath9 and then define @xmath119.\\ ] ] however , as usual , we are required to invert this expression to give @xmath9 as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that @xmath120 we note that @xmath26 is only defined in the range @xmath121 . to put the action in canonical second - order form",
    "we define @xmath81 .",
    "the potential for @xmath38 , is then given by @xmath122\\ ] ] where , @xmath123 we now have that @xmath38 is restricted to the range @xmath124 .",
    "the potential is plotted in figure [ fig : sinrvp ] .",
    "we find that there is a single maximum of the potential at @xmath125 .",
    "the value of the potential at this point is @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 and @xmath128",
    ". thus we see that the maximum corresponds to the flat space solution @xmath129 as expected , and we can conclude that this vacuum is unstable .    for the solution at @xmath130 , we must take the branch @xmath131 .",
    "the expression for the potential is the same as the expression above , except that we must now define @xmath132 the resulting potential is plotted in figure [ fig : sinrvm ] .",
    "again @xmath38 is restricted to lie in the range @xmath124 .",
    "we now find a stable minimum at @xmath125 .",
    "this gives @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , showing that the minimum of the potential does indeed correspond to the constant curvature solution @xmath130 .",
    "we can concluded that this is a stable vacuum state .",
    "in fact , further analysis shows that all the vacua @xmath115 with @xmath136 are unstable maxima , while those with @xmath137 are stable minima .",
    "this final example demonstrates that the vacuum structure of higher - derivative theories can be complicated .",
    "we find an infinite number of stable and unstable vacua , each in a different branch of the theory .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that theories which are general functions of the scalar curvature @xmath3 , can be reduced to a canonical second - order form describing einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a potential which may have a vacuum structure of arbitrary complexity .",
    "further these vacua all correspond to constant curvature solutions of the original theory .",
    "the advantage of discussing the theory in the second - order formalism is that it is in a canonical form where we can easily identify the excitations around the vacuum .",
    "the disadvantage is that the problem of inverting @xmath138 means that we are forced to break the theory into regions separated by degenerate points .",
    "for this reason it is often easier to identify vacua as constant curvature solutions of the higher - derivative theory and then make a local transformation in the region of each solution to investigate the excitations around that vacuum .",
    "all of the non - trivial vacuum structure arises from non - linear terms in the field equations and so is missed in a quadratic expansion of the higher - derivative theory in terms of the fluctuation of the metric around flat space .",
    "further , any analysis of the particle content of the theory , in this case the presence of a new scalar degree of freedom and identification of its mass , can only be made once the vacuum is identified .",
    "in this and the following section we shall extend our discussion to include actions which are general functions of first the ricci tensor and then the riemann tensor .",
    "we shall use the same techniques as in the previous section , namely introducing auxiliary fields , showing that vacuum states correspond to constant curvature solutions of the higher derivative theory , and then investigating the excitations around a given vacuum .",
    "the reduction to a second - order form was first discussed by magnano _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and jakubiec and kijowski  @xcite . here",
    ", we shall use a slightly different analysis , again pointing out the need for identifying different branches of the theory and also giving a canonical separation of the new variables about any given vacuum .",
    "we shall only give the general formulation without specific examples .",
    "again we will find a rich structure of vacua which would be completely missed in a linearized analysis .",
    "this will re - emphasize the need to identify the vacuum in question before investigating the masses and couplings of the elementary excitations of the theory .    starting with an action",

    "we then define @xmath142 and invert the expression to give @xmath140 as a function of @xmath143 .",
    "note again that the introduction of both @xmath140 and @xmath143 requires the non - degeneracy condition @xmath144 if the auxiliary field is to be properly eliminated to return to the original action .",
    "furthermore , in inverting , it may be necessary to divide the theory into branches corresponding to different possible roots for @xmath140 .",
    "thus for the variable @xmath143 it may be necessary to introduce a collection of auxiliary variable theories each valid for a different branch of @xmath141 .",
    "we can ask how many degrees of freedom are there in the auxiliary field ? we have argued that we expect six .",
    "if we consider the @xmath140 formulation for now , we see first that we can again derive a spin - two divergence condition .",

    "this means , since the @xmath140 equation of motion gives @xmath145 that they are states of constant tensor curvature .",
