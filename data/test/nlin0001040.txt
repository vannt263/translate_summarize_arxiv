    "the interplay between disorder and many - body interactions continues to be one of the main topics of condensed matter physics . in one - dimensional quantum many - body systems without disorder ,",
    "the bethe ansatz ( ba ) has proven to be a valuable tool , giving access to the energy spectra and eigenstates of certain so - called integrable models @xcite . at first glance",
    ", it appears that the integrability , namely the existence of infinitely many integrals of motion , seems to preclude any applications of the method to disordered systems .",
    "however , in 1984 it was shown @xcite how to apply the ba method to the kondo problem @xcite of a single magnetic impurity in a bath of conduction electrons .",
    "further developments led to the construction and solution of integrable spin chains with embedded spin defects @xcite .",
    "a different approach to integrable impurity models was considered in references @xcite where impurity vertices are introduced by varying the _ local _ interaction parameters while preserving integrability .",
    "these studies have stimulated further investigations @xcite of such impurities in various systems .",
    "the resulting models have impurity terms with couple to the charge degrees of freedom , and look fairly similar to generic impurity terms . however , the energy spectrum is independent of the spatial distribution of the defects , and there is no localization of the ground - state wave function , unlike what is expected for generic impurities .",
    "this peculiar behaviour can be understood by the fact that integrability implies a purely forward - scattering mechanism at the impurities @xcite .",
    "there is no reflection and thus no possibility of destructive quantum interference which could lead to a localization .",
    "back - scattering can be introduced into integrable models by choosing suitable boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "sklyanin @xcite proposed a systematic approach to construct and solve integrable quantum spin systems with _",
    "open _ bc . central to his method are the so - called reflection equations ( re ) @xcite which are the boundary analogues of the yang - baxter equations ( ybe ) @xcite .",
    "together , the ybe and re imply the integrability of a model which can then be constructed as usual by the algebraic approach of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite .",
    "the finite - size corrections of the corresponding energy spectra and the asymptotic behaviour of correlation functions follow predictions based on boundary conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "we remark that the bc of sklyanin @xcite are called `` open '' in order to distinguish them from the more often used periodic and the free bc .",
    "although the term `` open '' seems to suggest particular transmission and reflection properties , this is not necessarily implied .",
    "the combination of open bc and integrable impurities has been considered in references @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the case where the forward - scattering impurity is directly coupled to a back - scattering open boundary @xcite .",
    "this combination may lead to physically relevant , yet completely integrable models .    in the present article , we construct two kinds of integrable impurities for a fermionic small - polaron model with general open bc . due to the fermionic nature of the model , we employ the graded version of the qism @xcite . for well - separated impurity vertices located within the bulk ,",
    "the local interaction terms involve the two neighbouring sites as usual @xcite . placing the forward - scattering impurities at the back - scattering boundaries ,",
    "we derive a hamiltonian with rather general boundary terms which may be interpreted as sources and sinks of particles at the boundaries . using the graded ybe and the graded re",
    ", we derive the ba equations , and obtain expressions for the eigenvalues for special cases of the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , we discuss the ground - state properties in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce the small - polaron model with general open bc . in section  [ sec3 ] , a class of integrable impurities is constructed by shifting the spectral parameters of local lax operators at arbitrary sites in the bulk . by embedding the impurity fermion vertex at each boundary of the model",
    ", we construct a class of integrable impurities with perfect back - scattering in section  [ sec4 ] . in section  [ sec5 ] ,",

    "the presence of boundary potentials ( magnetic fields ) and the impurity parameters changes the asymptotic behaviour of the ba equations resulting in string solutions different from those discussed in the papers @xcite .",
    "indeed , either the boundary parameters @xmath168 ( or @xmath169 ) or the impurity strength parameters @xmath43 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 affect the boundary string solutions to the ba equations . it is obvious that the ground - state energy of the bulk is same as in the periodic case @xcite . in general , the boundary states are associated with complex roots of the ba equations .",
    "analogously , we obtain the ground - state energy for the hamiltonians and .",
    "the differences to the ground states for these hamiltonians are only the contributions from the impurities expressed in @xmath172 .",

    "further thermodynamic properties such as compressibilities and susceptibilities can be calculated as demonstrated previously in @xcite .",
    "results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in the present work , we have considered the interplay of integrable impurities and general open boundary conditions for the example of the small - polaron model .",
    "the impurities have been constructed via inhomogeneous shifts in the spectral parameters of the lax operators such that the ybe are satisfied .",
    "the boundary terms are taken to obey the re . in both cases , we dealt with the graded version of the equations due to the fermionic nature of the particles and the boundary terms . thus by construction , the model remains integrable . we have shown that this is true even when placing the impurities directly at the boundaries .",
    "the most general boundary terms considered in include fermionic particle sources and sink terms as well as more standard density terms .",
    "however , these linear terms in creation and annihilation operators contain coefficients that are odd grassmann variables .",
    "thus a straightforward physical interpretation appears problematic . representing these coefficients @xmath175 , @xmath176 as additional fermionic operators",
    "@xmath177 , @xmath178 , we arrive at a chain with two additional sites but without sources and sinks .",
    "the boundary terms coupling to the particle density can be viewed as potential impurities  much like in the anderson model of localization @xcite  situated at the boundaries .",
    "for the special case with only these potential impurities and the integrable impurities present , we solve the ba equations and compute the ground - state energy in the thermodynamic limit for half - filling .",
    "we find that the solution is possible regardless whether the integrable impurities are located within the bulk or at the boundaries .",
    "the two types of impurities enter the expressions for the ground - state energy additively .",
    "thus the simultaneous presence of both purely forward scattering integrable impurities and purely reflecting boundary potential terms does not seem to change the physics in a substantial way .",
    "we therefore do not expect to see the onset of localization as might be expected from the form of the boundary impurities .",
    "an analogue of the integrable impurities can be found in the case of light waves .",
    "consider a long strip of glass , interspersed with pieces of bifringent material of the same index of refraction as the glass .",
    "then as circular polarized light enters the strip and reaches the first bifringent slab , its plane of polarization will be rotated by an angle @xmath179 where @xmath180 represents the length of the first slab and @xmath181 is the material specific rotation angle per unit length @xcite .",
    "there is no reflection at the contact due to the identical indices of refraction .",
    "after the next slab , we have @xmath182 and so on .",
    "thus the net effect of the bifringent slabs is a rotation of the plane of polarization , i.e. , a change in the overall phase of the wave function of light just as for the electronic wave function in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this picture",
    "the integrable boundaries satisfying the re then simply correspond to perfect mirrors at both ends of the strip .",
