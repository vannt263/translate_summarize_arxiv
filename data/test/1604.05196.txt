    "i want to consider the same problem for _ legendrian knots _ in _ contact @xmath0-manifolds_. the main result is a generalization of the result by gordon and luecke , roughly speaking it says the following ( see theorem  [ thm : contact1 ] in section  [ section : contactcomplement ] for the precise statement ) .",
    "[ legendrian knot exterior theorem ] [ main : main1 ] + a legendrian knot in the tight contact structure of @xmath1 is determined by the contactomorphism type of its exterior .",

    "the legendrian knot complement problem was also mentioned in @xcite .    in sections  [ section :",
    "contactcomplement]-[section : contactproof ] i recall the definition of _ contact dehn surgery _ and explain how to generalize the proof of gordon - luecke to this setting .",
    "the main ingredient for this is the fact that if there is a non - trivial contact dehn surgery along a legendrian knot in @xmath2 resulting again in @xmath2 , then this legendrian knot has to be a legendrian unknot of a very special type . an easy way to prove this fact ( given in section  [ section : appendix ] ) is looking at all other contact surgeries resulting topologically again in @xmath1 and finding a legendrian knot in its exterior that violates the bennequin inequality after the surgery .",
    "therefore , i present in section  [ section : loss ] a new formula to compute the thurston - bennequin invariant of such legendrian knots in the surgered manifold .",
    "moreover , in section  [ counterexample ] i explain how to do a crossing change in a legendrian knot diagram with help of a contact dehn surgery ( a so called _ contact rolfsen twist _ ) . with that it is easy to construct counterexamples to the legendrian link exterior problem in the tight contact structure of @xmath1 , i.e. two non - equivalent legendrian links with contactomorphic exteriors .",
    "finally , in section  [ topgenmfd ] and [ section : other ] i give a short discussion about the legendrian knot exterior problem in other manifolds .",

    "_ exotic cosmetic dehn surgery _ resulting in this manifold . in the contact",
    "setting it is not clear if this equivalence is true .",
    "but in section  [ section : other ] i present examples of legendrian knots in lens spaces not determined by their complements and of _ exotic cosmetic contact dehn surgeries_.",
    "all links are assumed to be tame and considered up to ( coarse ) equivalence .",
    "+ let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two links in an oriented closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath5 .",

    ". then one writes @xmath8 .     + the ( coarse ) equivalence is a weaker condition than the equivalence of knots up to isotopy . for example",
    "there is a reflection of @xmath1 that maps the left handed trefoil to the right handed trefoil , so this two knots are ( coarse ) equivalent , but one can show that the left handed trefoil is not isotopic to the right handed trefoil ( i.e. there is no such homeomorphism isotopic to the identity ) .",
    "one also can consider the * oriented ( coarse ) equivalence * , that means equivalence where only orientation preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath5 are allowed . in @xmath1",
    "oriented equivalence is equivalent to isotopy ( because in @xmath1 every orientation preserving homeomorphism is isotopic to the identity ) , but in general this is a weaker condition than isotopy .",
    "a first observation is , that if two links @xmath3 and @xmath4 are equivalent , then the complements are homeomorphic .",
    "the following question is called the * link complement problem * ( or for one component links , the * knot complement problem * ) :     + are two links in the same manifold with homeomorphic complements equivalent ?",
    "link complements are non - compact , but often it is much easier to work with compact manifolds .",
    "therefore , pick some regular ( closed ) neighborhood @xmath9 of a link @xmath10 in @xmath5 and call the complement @xmath11 of the interior @xmath12 of these neighborhood the * exterior * of @xmath10 .    the corresponding problem whether the equivalence class of a link is determined by the homeomorphism type of its exterior",
    "is called the * link exterior problem*. ( actually , this was the problem asked by tietze in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 15 ) . ) by work of edwards  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) this two problems are equivalent .",

    "but if one deletes the unknot @xmath13 out of @xmath4 then the remaining knot is a trefoil .",
    "so @xmath3 can not be equivalent to @xmath4 .",
    "but the exteriors of this links are homeomorphic , as one can see as follows : consider the exteriors @xmath14 of the unknot @xmath13 . then cut open this @xmath0-manifold along the seifert disk of the unknot @xmath13 , make a full @xmath15-twist and re - glue the two disks together again .",
    "this is called a * rolfsen twist * and describes a homeomorphism of the link exteriors .    by twisting several times along @xmath13 one",
    "can even get infinitely many non - equivalent links all with homeomorphic exteriors .",
    "the next natural question would be to ask if this holds on the level of knots .",

    "effectively one observes that there are two special kinds of curves on @xmath25 :    * the * meridian * @xmath26 : a simple closed curve on @xmath27 , that is non - trivial on @xmath27 , but trivial in @xmath28 . * the * longitudes * @xmath29 : simple closed curves on @xmath27 , that are non - trivial on @xmath27 and intersect @xmath26 transversely exactly once .",

    "the key point in the foregoing examples is that there is a so called * exotic cosmetic surgery * , that means two surgeries along the same knot resulting in the same manifold but with different slopes , such that there is no homeomorphism of the knot exterior mapping one slope to the other ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one can show that every knot in a given @xmath0-manifold is determined by its complement if and only if this manifold can not be obtained by exotic cosmetic surgery from another manifold .",
    "[ thm : cosmetic ] + the following two claims are equivalent .    1 .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be knots in a closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath5 with homeomorphic complements .",
    "then @xmath16 is equivalent to @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath241 be a knot in a closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath242 , such that @xmath243 and @xmath244 are both homeomorphic to @xmath5 ( for @xmath245 ) .",
    "then there exists a homeomorphism of the knot exterior @xmath246 mapping one slope to the other .     + ( 1 ) the statement holds in the oriented and unoriented case .",
    "+ ( 2 ) one can take the manifold @xmath242 to be homeomorphic to @xmath5 , this explains the name cosmetic surgery .",
    "[ proof of theorem  [ thm : cosmetic ] ] + the proof of @xmath247 works exactly as in the foregoing example .",
    "the implication @xmath248 is similar to the proof of theorem  [ thm : gordon - luecke1 ] .",
    "so the study of the knot complement problem is equivalent to the study of exotic cosmetic surgeries . in the topological",
    "setting some is known , but much remains open . beside the discussed knot complement theorem for knots in @xmath1 , gabai showed in @xcite that knots in @xmath104 ( or more generally in a connected sum of arbitrary @xmath249- or @xmath250-bundles over @xmath75 ) are determined by their complements .",
    "but in general manifolds this will not hold .",
    "building up on work by mathieu @xcite , rong classified in @xcite all knots in @xmath0-manifolds with seifert fibered complements , that are not determined by their complements .",
    "this knots are given by the spines of the solid tori in the standard heegaard splitting of some special lens spaces @xmath190 as described at the beginning of this section or as exceptional fibers of index @xmath71 in special seifert fibered manifolds .",
    "but all this homeomorphisms sending one of the exceptional fibers to another one have to be orientation reversing .",
    "later matignon @xcite proved that all non - hyperbolic knots in atoroidal irreducible seifert fibered @xmath0-manifolds are determined by their complements ( except the cores of the standard heegaard splittings in lens spaces ) .    for hyperbolic knots",
    "there is until now only one counterexample . in @xcite bleiler ,",
    "hodgson and weeks construct two non - equivalent hyperbolic knots in @xmath251 with orientation reversing homeomorphic complements .",
    "they also give very good reasons for the conjecture that all knots in hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds are determined by their oriented complements .",
    "recently ichihara and jong @xcite found examples of knots in hyperbolic manifolds with orientation reversing homeomorpic complements .",
    "all together this leads to the still open oriented knot complement conjecture in general manifolds :     + if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are knots in a closed oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath5 with orientation preserving homeomorphic complements ( not homeomorphic to @xmath36 ) , then the knots are orientation preserving equivalent .    with theorem [ thm : cosmetic ] and the following remark",
    "this is equivalent to the cosmetic surgery conjecture formulated in @xcite :     + exotic cosmetic surgeries ( not resulting in a lens space ) are never orientation preserving ( or * truly * ) cosmetic .",
    "many of the mentioned results rely on the classification of all dehn surgeries in a solid torus resulting again in a solid torus by berge @xcite and gabai @xcite .",
    "but in the last years also heegaard floer homology turned out to be a very useful tool to study such questions .",
    "for example , wang @xcite showed that there are no exotic dehn surgeries along seifert genus-@xmath37 knots in @xmath1 .",
    "the same holds for non - trivial algebraic knots in @xmath1 by @xcite .",
    "finally , in @xcite and @xcite it is shown that knots in @xmath10-space homology spheres are determined by their complements .",
    "in particular , knots in the poincar sphere are determined up to orientation preserving equivalence by the oriented homeomorphism types of their complements .",
    "as far as i know , nothing is known about this in the contact setting .",
    "the question is which results from the topological setting generalize to the contact setting and where are the differences . in the foregoing section",
    "i presented examples of non - equivalent knots in lens spaces with homeomorphic exteriors .",
    "the first interesting question is if one can generalize this examples to the contact setting .",
    "[ non - equivalent legendrian knots with the same complements ] + consider a legendrian knot @xmath18 with @xmath252 .",
    "a standard neighborhood of @xmath18 is given by @xmath253 the surface longitude is given by @xmath254 and the contact longitude by @xmath218 .",
    "take two copies @xmath255 and @xmath256 of this standard neighborhood and glue them together along their boundaries to obtain the lens space @xmath190 as follows : +   +    ( 20,10)*+l(p , q)=``a'';(30,10)*+==``a1 '' ; ( 40,10)*+v_1=``c '' ; ( 60,10)*++=``d '' ; ( 80,10)*+v_2=``e'';(95,10)*+/_~=``e1'';(40,5)*+_1=``f '' ; ( 80,5)*+-q_2+p_2,=``g'';(40,0)*+_1=``h '' ; ( 80,0)*+r_2+s_2,=``i'';@|- > `` f'';``g '' ; @|- > `` h'';``i '' ;     +   + where @xmath257 .",
    "it is a standard fact that the contact structures on the solid tori fit together to a contact structure in the new lens space @xmath190 if the gluing map sends the contact longitude of @xmath258 to the contact longitude of @xmath259 .",

    "it follows that @xmath262 .",
    "in particular , it follows that if a contact lens space is obtained by gluing together two standard neighborhoods of legendrian knots , then the lens space is of the form @xmath263 .",
    "but in this case the spines @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the heegaard tori are topologically equivalent , as was explained in the foregoing section .",

    "therefore they both have order @xmath264 in @xmath265 .",
    "the extended seifert longitude @xmath63 of @xmath17 is given by @xmath266 ( it is nullhomologous in the exterior of @xmath17 and @xmath267 . )",
    "so one computes @xmath268 to compute @xmath269 one first computes the inverse gluing map as : +   +    ( 20,10)*+l(p , p-1)=``a'';(32,10)*+==``a1 '' ; ( 40,10)*+v_2=``c '' ; ( 60,10)*++=``d '' ; ( 80,10)*+v_1=``e'';(95,10)*+/_~=``e1'';(40,5)*+_2=``f '' ; ( 80,5)*+(1-pn)_1-p_1,=``g'';(40,0)*+_2=``h '' ; ( 80,0)*+pn^2_1+(1+pn)_1.=``i'';@|- > `` f'';``g '' ; @|- > `` h'';``i '' ;     +   + then one sees that the extended seifert longitude of @xmath16 is given by @xmath270 and so @xmath271 so the rational thurston - bennequin invariants are different , therefore @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not legendrian isotopic and then also not coarse equivalent .",
    "so in contrast to the topological case one gets obvious counterexamples to the legendrian knot exterior conjectures exactly in the lens spaces @xmath263 .",
    "it would be interesting if one can generalize the examples from this section to a general classification result in lens spaces .      a first step to study the legendrian knot exterior problem in general contact manifolds",
    "would be a generalization of theorem  [ thm : cosmetic ] .",
    "the generalization of the implication @xmath248 one can prove similarly to the proof of theorem  [ thm : contact1 ] .",
    "+ let @xmath18 be a legendrian knot in a contact manifold @xmath72 , such that there is no non - trivial contact dehn surgery along @xmath18 resulting again in @xmath72 .",
    "then the equivalence type of @xmath18 is determined by the contactomorphism type of its exterior .",
    "but the other implication does not generalize .",
    "the problem is again that the new glued - in solid torus is in general not a standard neighborhood of a legendrian knot as explained in section  [ counterexample ] .",
    "so it is not directly clear if exotic cosmetic contact surgeries leads to counterexamples to the legendrian knot exterior problem .",
    "but their existence is interesting in its own .",
    "the following example was obtained earlier by geiges and onaran ( see also @xcite ) .    [ exotic contact surgeries ] + consider the two different contact dehn surgeries along the legendrian unknot @xmath13 with @xmath96 in @xmath2 with respect to the contact surgery coefficients @xmath272 and @xmath273 ( see figure [ fig : lensspace ] ) . by expressing the surgery coefficients with respect to the surface",
    "longitude @xmath39 given by the meridian of the complementary solid torus one sees that the resulting manifolds are topologically the manifolds from the example from the foregoing section , so the homeomorphic lens spaces @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "the next thing i want to show is that the two contact surgeries are unique and represent the same contact manifold .",
    "therefore one uses the same approach as in the example in section  [ section : contactsurgery ] . the same argument as in that example shows that the two surgery diagrams both represent a unique contact structure @xmath91 on @xmath230 .",
    "the from the algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1 ) resulting @xmath217-contact surgery diagrams are shown in figure [ fig : lensspace ] in the middle ( for both contact surgeries is only one of the two possible stabilizations drawn ) .",
    "both surgery diagrams contain only @xmath105-contact surgeries , so the resulting contact structures have to be tight .",
    "but the classification of tight contact structures on lens spaces ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) says that on @xmath230 there are two non - contactomorphic tight contact structures , so in this case this is not enough to conclude that these surgery diagrams represent the same contact manifold .    to show that the contact structures of the two different surgeries are really contactomorphic one changes the contact dehn surgery diagrams into compatible open book decompositions ( for details see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting open books are shown in figure [ fig : lensspace ] on the right .",
    "all colored curves represent right - handed dehn twists , the blue ones correspond to the monodromy of the open book decomposition of @xmath2 and the red and orange curves represent the dehn twists corresponding to the same colored legendrian links .",
    "all dehn twists together represent the monodromy of @xmath274 . by interchanging the holes , these two open books are the same , and therefore represent the same contact manifolds .",
    "these cosmetic contact surgeries are exotic because the corresponding topological cosmetic surgeries are exotic ( i.e. there is no homeomorphism of the exterior of the unknot that maps one slope to the other ) .    with exactly the same methods one can get many other examples of this kind . for example",
    ", by contact dehn surgery along @xmath13 with contact surgery coefficients @xmath275 and @xmath276 one gets contactomorphic contact structures on the lens spaces @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "an easy consequence of the contact dehn surgery theorem [ thm : contact2 ] is that the only possible candidates for legendrian knots in @xmath2 admitting a ( non - trivial ) contact surgery resulting again in @xmath2 are the legendrian unknots of type @xmath107 .    that cosmetic contact surgeries along such knots really exists was shown in the example in section  [ section : contactsurgery ] .",
    "it is also possible to show that every legendrian unknot of type @xmath107 admits ( infinitely many ) cosmetic contact surgeries resulting again in @xmath2 . by computing explicitly the @xmath279-invariants ( see @xcite ) of all other contact surgeries one can show that these are the only cosmetic contact surgeries from @xmath2 to @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , in section [ counterexample ] i showed that all topological examples of links not determined by their complements , where one does a composition of @xmath105-rolfsen twist along unknot components , works also for the contact case .",
    "but in the topological category there are also examples that do not arise in this way .",
    "teragaito @xcite and ichihara @xcite construct , building up on unpublished work of berge , links in @xmath1 with no unknot components , such that non - trivial dehn surgery along that link leads again to @xmath1 .",
    "similar to the arguments in theorem [ thm : cosmetic ] this leads to links not determined by their complements .",
    "gordon proves in @xcite that for every such link ( not determined by its complement , but without unknot components ) there exists only finitely many other links with homeomorphic complements .",
    "finally in @xcite the reverse question is considered .",
    "they study links that * are * determined by their complements .",
