    "noncommutative spacetime is spacetime with noncommutative spacetime coordinates @xcite-@xcite . since there appears uncertainty in non - commuting directions , noncommutative spacetime can be considered as an interesting candidate for new notion of quantum spacetime .",

    "it is known that noncommutative field theories are related to string theory and quantum gravity . in string theory , for example",
    ", noncommutative field theory is an effective theory , which is obtained in the @xmath1 limit of the open string theory with constant background @xmath2 field @xcite . in quantum gravity , for example , the effective dynamics of quantum particles coupled to three - dimensional quantum gravity can be expressed in terms of an effective noncommutative field theory which respects the principles of doubly special relativity @xcite .",
    "but some noncommutative field theories do not respect the principles of special relativity or quantum mechanics .",
    "the simplest example is the spacetime with the noncommutativity @xmath3=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath4 is a constant antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the field theory on the noncommutative spacetime does not have the ordinary lorentz symmetry except in two - dimensions , since @xmath4 is not lorentz invariant is proportional to @xmath5 and is lorentz invariant . ] , while recent developments show that noncommutative field theory has twisted poincar symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is not unitary in the standard path integral quantization procedure with feynman s prescription , when it has space / time noncommutativity @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "this was shown by computing explicitly the one - loop amplitudes and showing the violation of the cutkosky rule .",
    "also it is known that acausal effects occur , when it has space / time noncommutativity @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has an unusual behavior , called uv - ir mixing , that the ultra - violet divergences appear in the limit of vanishing external momenta @xcite-@xcite .",
    "is it possible to construct field theories on deformed spacetime which preserve both lorentz symmetry and unitarity ?",
    "since lorentz symmetry mixes space and time directions , the known facts in the preceding paragraph suggest that it becomes necessarily complicated for noncommutative spacetime . in this paper",
    ", we pursue the possibility of nonassociative spacetime .",
    "in fact , nonassociativity is known to appear in open string theory with non - constant background @xmath2 field @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that the algebra of closed string field theory should be commutative nonassociative @xcite .",
    "there are also other discussions on nonassociative theory @xcite . especially in @xcite , they discussed commutative nonassociative gauge theory with lorentz symmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section we study scalar @xmath6 field theory obtained from the commutative nonassociative product , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant nonassociative deformation parameter .",
    "this product is obviously poincar invariant .",
    "since this product contains an infinite number of space - time derivatives , unitarity seems to be a non - trivial issue .",
    "we find that this field theory satisfies the cutkosky rule for the one - loop self - energy diagram .    in section [ sec : p4 ]",
    "we replace the above commutative nonassociative product to avoid a divergence in the amplitude .",
    "in fact the real part of the one - loop amplitude diverges exponentially in minkowski spacetime , when we adopt the above product .",
    "this divergence is irrelevant to the discussions about the one - loop unitarity in section [ sec : p2 ] , but may harm the significance of the field theory based on the above product .",
    "thus we change the square of momenta on the exponential to the forth power , and study the field theory based on the new product .",
    "we check the one - loop cutkosky rule to some orders of @xmath8 , and find the unitarity holds also in this case .    in section [ sec : gen ] we discuss scalar field theories obtained from poincar invariant commutative associative algebras , and find that the couplings become constant in general .",
    "this shows that non - trivial behaviors of scalar field theories can appear only when commutativity or associativity of algebras is lost .",
    "the final section is devoted to discussions and comments .",
    "we make an observation concerning the reason why our nonassociative field theories satisfy the unitarity relation from the viewpoint of a qualitative difference in non - locality between noncommutative field theories and our commutative nonassociative field theories .",
    "noncommutative field theories can be constructed from replacing the usual multiplication of fields in the lagrangian with moyal product , @xmath9 then the spacetime noncommutativity is given by @xmath10=x^{\\mu}\\ast x^{\\nu}-x^{\\nu}\\ast x^{\\mu}=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}.\\ ] ] this spacetime noncommutativity breaks lorentz symmetry except in two dimensions .",

    "this parameter is taken to be real for the tree level unitarity to hold .",
    "for the plane waves , the product ( [ eq : p2nonas ] ) becomes @xmath13 this is obviously poincar invariant , since it preserves the lorentz symmetry and the momentum conservation .",
    "one can easily check that this product is commutative but nonassociative , @xmath14 field theories based on the product ) , because this is the simplest non - trivial choice if we impose the product to have the exponential form and poincar invariance .",
    "you may hit upon another choice , @xmath15 but this product is commutative associative , and field theory based on it is trivial in the sense discussed in section [ sec : gen ] .",
    "in fact , one can multiply the right hand side of ( [ eq : momentumrep ] ) by any commutative associative factor with no change of field theory ( see section [ sec : gen ] for more details . ) .",
    "therefore the expression ( [ eq : momentumrep ] ) is essentially the general case with the form of the exponential of a quadratic function of momenta .",

    "a poincar invariant commutative associative algebra has the general expression , @xmath181 where @xmath182 is a lorentz invariant function of two momenta @xmath183 and must satisfy the conditions , @xmath184 where ( [ eq : com ] ) and ( [ eq : asso ] ) are the conditions for commutativity and associativity , respectively .",
    "we also assume a positivity property , @xmath185 for general @xmath186 .",
    "as can be seen below , this condition is required for the kinetic term of field theory to be non - singular .",
    "let us consider scalar @xmath6 theory based on the above star product .",
    "the action is given by @xmath187.\\ ] ] we define the fourier transformation of @xmath19 as @xmath188 where @xmath189 is a normalization factor , which will be determined later .",
    "substituting the fourier transformation to the action , we get @xmath190 where @xmath191 is @xmath192 .    the physics should not depend on the normalization @xmath189 of the momentum modes .",
    "therefore we can make the propagator of this theory to have the usual form @xmath193 by choosing    @xmath194    this choice is allowed from the positivity assumption ( [ eq : positivity ] ) .",
    "then the momentum dependence of the three - point vertex is obtained as @xmath195 for the convenience of the following discussions , let us consider the square of ( [ eq:3pv ] ) , @xmath196 using the associativity ( [ eq : asso ] ) , @xmath197 , @xmath198 can be rewritten as @xmath199 since @xmath200 is a lorentz invariant function , it has the property , @xmath201 using ( [ eq : com ] ) , ( [ eq : asso ] ) , ( [ eq : toyu ] ) and ( [ eq : changeprop ] ) , we can further show @xmath202 on the other hand , from ( [ eq : asso ] ) , we find @xmath203 .",
    "using the positivity ( [ eq : positivity ] ) , we conclude @xmath204 therefore @xmath198 is actually a constant , and the coupling does not have momentum dependence .",
    "the above proof can be generalized to the general coupling @xmath205 as follows .",
    "the corresponding generalization of @xmath198 is given by @xmath206 this quantity satisfies an inductive relation , @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "the factor in front has actually the same form as ( [ eq : defofh ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath209 and @xmath210 are related by a constant multiplication .",
    "since we have shown @xmath211 is a constant , any @xmath209 is also a constant by induction . thus we see that commutative associative scalar field theories do not have momentum dependence of couplings .",
    "we find that our commutative nonassociative field theories satisfy the one - loop unitarity of figure [ fig : cutkosky ] in the standard path integral scheme .",
    "this is in contrast with the violation of unitarity in noncommutative field theories with space / time noncommutativity in the standard path integral scheme .",
    "however , our result is based on the explicit computations of the one - loop self - energy diagrams of the field theories obtained from certain commutative nonassociative algebras .",
    "therefore it is not clear how general our result is , i.e. whether unitarity holds for other diagrams and other commutative nonassociative algebras . concerning this question , we point out a qualitative difference in non - locality between our field theories and the noncommutative field theories in the following paragraph .",
    "noncommutative field theories defined by moyal product ( [ eq : moyal ] ) are non - local in real directions .",
    "we can easily see this by using the momentum representation as @xmath212 therefore when there is space / time noncommutativity , there exists non - locality in time , and field theories will inevitably show some pathological behaviors such as violation of unitarity @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand , our star product ( [ eq : momentumrep ] ) can be rewritten in the form , @xmath213 one notices that the coordinates are shifted in the imaginary directions .",
    "this feature is also true for the star product ( [ eq : momrepquartic ] ) .",
    "therefore our star products do not have the non - locality in the real time direction , and this qualitative difference may be the essence of why our field theories do not show the violation of unitarity , even though our products contain an infinite number of derivatives with respect to the coordinates .",
    "it is known that noncommutative field theories have the uv - ir mixing property @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the uv - ir mixing is a phenomenon that the ultra - violet divergences appear when external momenta approach zero .",
    "this occurs because the limit of vanishing external momenta has similar effects as the commutative limit @xmath214 in loop amplitudes . on the other hand",
    ", the explicit expressions of the one - loop amplitudes ( [ eq : mrepexp1 ] ) , ( [ eq : mrepexp2 ] ) do not seem to have this sort of similarity between the two limits .",
    "therefore our commutative nonassociative field theories will be free from the uv / ir mixing .",
    "the idea of noncommutativity of coordinates stems from the quantization of spacetime . but",
    "how about nonassociativity ?",
    "is there any relation to quantization ?",
    "actually , it seems that nonassociativity can lead to noncommutativity in some situations .",
    "let us define a right - operation @xmath215 for an element @xmath46 of a nonassociative algebra as @xmath216 then one finds @xmath217c = a*(b*c)-b*(a*c),\\ ] ] which does not vanish in general even when the nonassociative algebra is commutative .",
    "therefore @xmath215 is noncommutative in general",
    ". it would be interesting to find such effects of noncommutativity in commutative nonassociative field theories .",
