    "variational wave functions play a fundamental role in our understanding of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect , with the laughlin wave function @xcite being the most prominent example .",
    "new classes of quantum hall trial wave functions have been proposed as correlation functions in various conformal field theories ,  @xcite by generalizing the clustering properties of the wave functions ,  @xcite or as jack polynomials with a negative parameter and a matching root configuration .",
    "@xcite for a long time it has been understood that the laughlin wave function , as well as other fqh trial wave functions , contains _ no _ variational parameter .",
    "this understanding is the consequence of our interest in searching for _ topologically distinct _",
    "quantum hall wave functions ; geometry , as oppose to topology , is believed to be redundant .",
    "recently one of us  @xcite pointed out that such topological description of fqh wave functions is not complete ; in his geometrical description the original laughlin wave function is simply a member of a family of laughlin states , parameterized by a hidden ( continuous ) geometrical degree of freedom .",
    "the family of the laughlin states , with the geometrical factor as a variational parameter , should provide a better description of the fqh effect in the presence of either anisotropic effective mass or anisotropic interaction , which are present in real materials .",
    "the anisotropic fqh states are of present interest , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", some of us studied the quantum hall effects in a fast rotating quasi - two - dimensional gas of polarized fermionic dipoles .",
    "the fast rotation is equivalent to the high magnetic field according to the larmor theorem . and since @xmath0-wave interaction for the polarized fermions is typically very small unless in the resonance regime , the only significant interaction is the dipole - dipole interaction that could be tuned by adjusting the applied electric and magnetic fields . by tuning the direction of the dipole moment with respect to the @xmath1 axis ,",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction becomes anisotropic in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "specifically , the system contain two parameters : the confining strength determined by the rotation frequency and the tilt angle determined by the applied field .",
    "thus such systems have highly tunable anisotropic interactions , and are ideal for studies of anisotropic fqh states .",
    "results in ref .   clearly indicate the _ inadequacy _ of the known variational wave functions in the description of such states .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "consideration of possible anisotropic fqh states has a long history ,  @xcite with variational wave functions constructed that are straightforward modifications of the original laughlin wave function .",
    "@xcite unlike the original laughlin wave function and the states to be discussed here however , these earlier anisotropic fqh states are _ not _ exact eigenstates of special 2-body hamiltonians .",
    "interest in such states was partially motivated by the observation of _ compressible _ states with strong anisotropic transport properties in high landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "@xcite in all these states , the rotation symmetry is broken _",
    "spontaneously_. very recently , an anisotropic fqh state has been observed at @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite in this case the rotation symmetry is broken _ explicitly _ by an in - plane magnetic field , whose direction dictates the transport anisotropy .",
    "generalizations of the fqh states to lattice models with zero net magnetic field and full lattice translation symmetry is also called for to describe fractional quantum anomalous hall states and fractional topological insulators .  @xcite    ref",
    ".   pointed out the existence of a family of laughlin states that are zero energy ground states of a family of hamiltonians consisting of projection operators , which depend on a parameter called guiding center metric .",
    "however the states themselves were not constructed explicitly , and only some of their qualitative properties were mentioned briefly .",
    "the main motivation of this work is to explore the construction of a family of wave functions _ in closed form _ with numerical comparisons to facilitate the study of the geometrical aspects of anisotropic fqh states as a result of anisotropic interaction in the planer geometry .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the original laughlin wave function was most easily written down on a disc , using the symmetric gauge in which the single particle basis states are angular momentum eigenstates .",
    "the key to explicitly constructing the anisotropic laughlin states proposed in ref .",
    "( on a disc ) is the usage of a set of _ anisotropic _ ll basis states .",
    "we will , however , continue to use the symmetric gauge , in which the lowest ll ( lll ) wave functions are holomorphic .",
    "the same set of basis states appeared earlier in the consideration of deformation of shape of quantum hall liquids in the context of hall viscosity  @xcite , although the wave functions were not explicitly given . in the following",
    "we generate them explicitly .",
    "in addition , we also use them to construct the corresponding integer quantum hall wave function , as a warm - up for their later application to fqh states .",
    "let us start from the eigenvalues problem of a two - dimensional charged particle subjected into a uniform magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the one - body hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 where we used the einstein convention , @xmath7 is the cyclotron effective mass tensor , @xmath8 is the charge of the particle , @xmath9 is the vector potential of the uniform magnetic field @xmath10 , and the dynamical momentum @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12=i\\epsilon_{ab}\\hbar^2\\ell^{-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 the 2d antisymmetric levi - civita symbol and @xmath14 the magnetic length . in terms of a complex vector @xmath15",

    "however , it is possible to construct a set of closely related but _ different _ set of basis states .",
    "first let us write @xmath47 the conventional basis is then just the set of the simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath31 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 we may write @xmath50 = @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a positive - definite euclidean metric tensor with @xmath54 = 1 . note",
    "that @xmath51 uses the `` galilean metric '' derived from the effective mass tensor , @xmath55 however , as has been stressed by one of us@xcite , that before specifying the two - body interactions , there is no fundamental reason to choose a guiding - center basis that is adapted to the shape of the landau orbits .",
    "there is a more general family of bases , parameterized by a complex number @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 that determines a unimodular metric @xmath59 , @xmath60 according to @xmath61 and then @xmath62 .",
    "we can then construct a basis of eigenstates @xmath63 of @xmath31 and @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 , which is accomplished by defining a new set of `` guiding center '' ladder operators , also considered in ref .  ,",

    "[ anislll1 ] in which we plot the density profiles @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "these zeros are roots of @xmath91 , and they are aligned along the stretched direction . in the limit of @xmath109 , they collapse to a multiple root at the origin .",
    "third , the stretching direction is determined by the phase of the complex number @xmath56 , @xmath110 , which is easy to understand by noting that @xmath111 gives rise to three roots , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . in fig .",
    "[ anislll2 ] , we plot @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "the slater determinant @xmath138 with the partition @xmath139 $ ] is the generalized @xmath140-particle iqh state , whose ( unnormalized ) expression could be simplified as @xmath141 as lower - degree polynomials must vanish due to the pauli exclusion principle ( this is generally not the case for other partitions , which is the key to understanding the anisotropic fqh states ) .",
    "the generalized iqh state can also be viewed as a coherent superposition of the isotropic iqh state ( or simple vandermonde determinant state ) and its edge states with angular momentum differences being multiples of @xmath142 .",
    "this is achieved by expanding the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ giqh ] ) . from the viewpoint of the superposition ,",
    "this is consistent with the numerical result in ref .  .",
    "in this section , we first consider the two - particle problem and then simplify the interaction hamiltonian projected into the lll in subsec .  [ two ] .",
    "more importantly , we present the recipe to find the anisotropic counterpart of a lll state and elaborate it in subsec .",
    "we specifically consider the anisotropic counterpart of the prominent fqh states such as the laughlin state in subsec .",
    "[ afqh ] .",
    "if the interaction is dominated by the energy gap @xmath20 between the lowest and second landau level , the interaction hamiltonian could be projected into the lowest landau level . in terms of non - commuting `` guiding center ''",

    "in addition , the total angular momentum associated with the guiding center is given by @xmath149    for two - particle , the lll states that simultaneously diagonalize @xmath150 and the interaction @xmath151 are completely fixed by symmetry .",
    "to clarify this , let us note that @xmath152 with @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and the only term containing operator in the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath155 , are given by @xmath156 \\nonumber\\\\ r^{y}_1-r^{y}_2&=&\\frac{\\ell}{i\\lambda } \\left[(1+\\gamma)a^\\dag_{12\\gamma}-(1+\\gamma^*)a_{12\\gamma}\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and contains only @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , we could expand @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the orthonormal basis @xmath159 and find that @xmath160    thus the projected operator @xmath146 for many - particle system could be rewritten as @xmath161 and in second quantized form as @xmath162 with @xmath163 .    for the rotationally - invariant case , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and the translation into the heisenberg state is @xmath166 and the vacuum state @xmath167 that satisfy @xmath168 .",
