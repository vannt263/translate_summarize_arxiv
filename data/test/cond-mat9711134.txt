    "granular media are materials where fluctuations are very large . when filling a silo with grains ,",
    "a part of the weight of the grains is supported by the walls of the silo , meaning that the bottom plate of the silo only carries an _ apparent weight _ @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is well known and was studied by janssen at the end of the last century .",
    "when repeating this procedure with the very same amount of grain , one observe large fluctuations of @xmath0 , typically of order @xmath1 ! on a given silo , @xmath0 can also vary drastically because of very small perturbations , such as variations of temperature or density @xcite .",
    "these effects can be understood in terms of _ arching_. as a matter of fact , stress propagation in granular media is strongly inhomogeneous : clear stress paths are present and carry an important part of the total weight of the grains .",
    "those paths , or arches , are completely different from a realisation to another , leading ( potentially ) to very different values of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the geometry of these paths can easily rearrange under small perturbations , inducing strong fluctuations in @xmath0 .",
    "another phenomenon closely connected to the presence of these arches is that of the stick - slip motion .",
    "imagine trying to push some granular material through a tube with a piston .",
    "moments where the system jams ( stick ) and moments where the system slides ( slip ) will irregulary alternate .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the stress paths network is sometimes able to resist to the applied force , and sometimes is not , depending on its structure ( which fluctuates ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a very simple numerical model which qualitatively captures some features of the above effects .",
    "this model will be called the scalar arching model , or samin the following .",
    "the model we are going to present is an extension of that proposed by liu , coppersmith et al .",
    "@xcite , which allows for arch formation .",
    "this model only deals with the vertical normal component of the stress tensor , @xmath2 , the ` weight ' . in that sense ,",
    "the model is _",
    "scalar_. this is obviously a simplifying choice which may not be justified .",
    "work is in progress for extending this model to a fully tensorial description ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "again for simplicity , we will keep to a two dimensional situation . note that arching effects are expected to be more pronounced than in three dimensions .",
    "= 5.5 cm    the system we would like to describe is shown in figure [ shema]-(a ) . following liu et al.s approach ,",
    "the granular packing is represented by a regular square lattice .",
    "each site is a ` grain ' labelled by two integers @xmath3 giving its horizontal and vertical coordinate .",
    "all the randomness of the local packing , the friction , the size and shape of the grains , is assumed to be encoded into random transmission coefficients @xmath4 .",
    "the rule for the propagation of the weight is the following : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the weight of a grain .",
    "this rule simply means that each grain supports the force of its two upwards neighbours and share its own load randomly between its two downwards neighbours .",
    "( the rle of correlations has been recently discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the mass conservation constraint imposes @xmath7 . at this stage ,",
    "the model is the one considered in @xcite .",
    "we now include a _ local slip condition _ : when the shear on a given grain is too strong , the grain can slip and lose its contact with its neighbours opposite to the direction of the shear .",
    "more precisely , one defines a threshold @xmath8 such that @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "these rules lead to an avalanche - like process : suppose , as shown on figure [ shema]-(b ) , that the link between the grains @xmath3 and @xmath11 is removed because the force @xmath12 is much larger than @xmath13 .",
    "the force from @xmath3 to @xmath14 is then very likely to be much larger than the force from @xmath15 to @xmath14 , and the link between the grains @xmath14 and @xmath16 is very likely to be removed as well .",
    "this process ( that was called _ static avalanche _ in @xcite ) can be interpreted as an _",
    "arch formation_.    a particular value of @xmath0 is associated to a particular configuration of the stress paths . at the walls ,",
    "forces are absorbed with the following rule : if @xmath17 , the fraction @xmath18 of the load @xmath19 is absorbed .",
    "depending on the configuration of the stress paths , a larger or smaller part of the weight of the grains is then supported by the walls , leading to differents values of @xmath0 .",
    "we studied the probability distribution function ( p.d.f . ) of the values of @xmath0 from many different configurations of the stress paths ( i.e. from many different silos ) .",
    "the relative standard deviation from the mean value is as large as @xmath20 , as found experimentally .",
    "we also looked at the p.d.f .",
    "of the local weight @xmath21 and found it to be a power - law , meaning that extremely large values are expected .",
    "= 6.5 cm    the most striking feature of this model is that the stress paths network generated by the sam  ( as shown in figure [ reseau ] ) is very likely to rearrange under small perturbations .",
    "our control parameter for generating perturbations is the threshold @xmath8 .",
    "this coefficient does not actually represent a specific physical quantity but can be seen as representing the temperature and/or the compacity . as a matter of fact ,",
    "contacts between grains ar very sensible to small changes of those two quantities .",
    "what we observed in the sam  is that when @xmath8 is changed by a very small amount , the stress paths network sometimes rearranges and sometimes does not .",
    "when it does , @xmath0 changes by a relative amount @xmath22 which can be either small or large , meaning that the actual value of @xmath22 is not correlated to the amount by which @xmath8 has been changed .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 is found to be power - law distributed : @xmath23 , which means that large rearrangements of the stress paths network are as probable as small ones . in that sense ,",
    "the sam  captures the feature that granular matter is extremely ` fragile ' , i.e. , sensitive to small perturbations .",
    "actually , our model is close in spirit to the large class of ` soc ' ( self - organized critical ) models @xcite , initially proposed to describe true ` dynamical ' avalanches in granular media .",
    "when the bottom plate of the silo is used as an upwards pushing piston ( see figure [ shema2 ] ) , an irregular stick - slip motion of the system is observed @xcite .",
    "= 6.5 cm    this behaviour can be understood by the fact that the stress paths network rearranges , generating configurations where it can resist to @xmath24 ( sticking or jamming situations ) and configurations where it can not ( slipping or sliding situations ) . in this section",
    ", we will explain how one can slightly modify the original version of the sam   to describe this situation .",
    "the idea is to look at the sam  picture ` upside down ' .",
    "we neglect the weight of the grains and focus on the transmission of @xmath24 through the grains , from the bottom of the cell to the walls and the free surface .",
    "all propagation rules are kept the same .",
    "the only noticeable change from last section is what happens at the walls .",
    "because strong arching is expected at the walls when @xmath24 is applied , we introduce a new parameter @xmath25 , the ` jamming ability ' of the walls . with probability @xmath26 absorbing",
    "rules of the last section apply . with probability @xmath25",
    "however , the load @xmath27 is completely absorbed by the wall , meaning that a local arch is strongly ` anchored ' on the wall .",
    "such situations are essential to get the system jammed . in addition to the @xmath28 , we now then have new random numbers @xmath29 which , compared to @xmath25 , determines which absorbing rule applied at site @xmath30 .",
    "we then propose the following algorithm .",
    "for a given force @xmath24 , and a given set of random numbers @xmath28 and @xmath29 , + @xmath31 we calculate @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively the total forces on the walls and on the top surface of the silo . obviously , @xmath34 .",
    "+ @xmath31 if @xmath35 , the grains do not move .",
    "stick _ situation .",
    "we then increase the applied force @xmath24 of @xmath36 and the time @xmath37 of @xmath38 . in order to mimick the mechanical noise",
    ", we also change all random numbers with probability @xmath39 , and go back to the first point .",
    "+ @xmath31 if @xmath40 , the static equilibrium conditions for the system are not satisfied , which means that grains are moving .",
    "it is a _ slip _ situation .",
    "we then decrease the applied force @xmath24 by @xmath36 , change all random numbers ( because the flow motion completely rearranges the packing ) , and go back to the first point .",
    "+ the simulation starts at @xmath41 with @xmath42 and let @xmath43 evolve .",
    "it is important to note that our model is a pure static model : no dynamics is included .",
    "therefore , the motion of the grains during the slipping moment is assumed to be infinitely quick .",
    "we then actually describe only sticking situations , separated by slipping moments which have two effects : untighten the spring governing the external force @xmath24 , and reinitialize the structure of the packing ( i.e. the random numbers ) .",
    "such an algorithm leads indeed to an irregular stick - slip motion .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters controlling the system , two different behaviours are observed . for small values of the aspect ratio @xmath44 or the ` jamming ability ' @xmath25 , situations where the system never jams for",
    "ever are typically observed , see figure [ phases]-(a ) .",
    "we called these situations _ slipping _ stick - slip phases . on the contrary , _ sticking",
    "_ stick - slip phases are seen for large values of @xmath44 and @xmath25 , see figure [ phases]-(b ) . the critical curves @xmath45 or @xmath46 can be plotted for a fixed @xmath44 , which separate the two regimes .",
    "we caracterized the first phase by the first return time @xmath47 , i.e. the interval of time between two consecutive times where @xmath24 vanishes , and the second one by the slope @xmath48 .",
    "just below the critical point , @xmath47 is be power - law distributed with an exponent @xmath49 , meaning that @xmath24 simply behaves like a random walk .",
    "when @xmath50 we find @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to e. kolb , t. mazozi , j. duran , e. clment , j. rajchenbach , d. loggia and p. mills for many fruitful discussions on this model ."
