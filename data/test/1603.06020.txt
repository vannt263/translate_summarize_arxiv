    "we note that if @xmath12 is connected then @xmath243 is a conjugacy class in @xmath244 .",
    "so for connected @xmath4 the converse of theorem  [ thm : conjugation_criterion ] holds .",
    "in fact , by using lemma 25 in @xcite if @xmath4 is a connected conjugation quandle one may even find a connected quandle @xmath12 such that @xmath228 .",
    "however , we do not assume connectivity for the results of this section .",

    "theorem  [ thm : conjugation_criterion ] and corollaries  [ cor : no - inn ] , [ cor : noy ] imply the following as well .",
    "[ cor : non - faith ] the following rig quandles are not conjugation quandles : @xmath247",
    "we are grateful to leandro vendramin for suggesting the criterion in this section for a connected quandle to be a conjugation quandle and for pointing out the relevance of lemma 1.8 in @xcite to its proof .",
    "the development here is from the paper @xcite by vendramin and heckenberger as well as the paper @xcite . for a ( finite ) quandle @xmath248 ,",
    "its _ enveloping group _ is the group @xmath249 with presentation @xmath250 and with the natural mapping @xmath251 this group has been defined and used several times previously , joyce @xcite denoted it by @xmath252 , fenn and rourke called it the _ associated group _ and denoted it by @xmath253 @xcite , and eisermann @xcite called it the _ adjoint group _ and denoted it by @xmath254 .",

    "finite enveloping group_. that this group is finite was proved in @xcite , lemma 2.17 . as in @xcite",
    "we write @xmath259 for the canonical surjection .",
    "let @xmath260 be the natural mapping from @xmath4 to @xmath255 , that is @xmath261 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath262 is a quandle homomorphism to @xmath255 considered as a quandle under conjugation .",
    "then we have the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : vc ] ( vendramin s criterion @xcite ) a connected quandle @xmath4 is a conjugation quandle if and only if @xmath263 is an injection .    it is clear that the mapping @xmath264 is universal for quandle homomorphisms @xmath265 where g is considered as a conjugation quandle .",
    "that is , for any such @xmath219 there is a unique group homomorphism @xmath266 such that @xmath267 .",
    "it then follows that if @xmath265 is an injection , that is , if @xmath4 is a conjugation quandle then @xmath268 must also be an injection . by lemma 1.8 in @xcite @xmath268",
    "is injective implies that @xmath262 is injective . since @xmath4",
    "is connected the converse is clear .",
    "clearly each faithful connected quandle is a conjugation quandle . among the 790 connected quandles of order at most 47",
    "there are precisely 66 non - faithful quandles . using /rig and vendramin s criterion",
    "we find that exactly 30 of the 66 non - faithful rig quandes are conjugations quandles .",
    "these are found in table  [ table : conj ] .",
    "@xmath269    these are listed in @xcite together with groups in which they are conjugation quandles .",
    "furthermore each of these 30 quandles is an abelian extension of index 2 of the form @xmath270 , as indicated in table  [ table : innconj ] . by theorem  [ ext_constant ]",
    "the corresponding cocycle invariants of these extensions are constant for all knots .",
    "note for example that @xmath271 has three different such cocycle extensions .",
    "this is possible since @xmath272 .",
    "@xmath273    some of the quandles in table  [ table : conj ] are missed in corollary  [ cor : rig ] since they are homomorphic images under @xmath119 of quandles that are too large to be found easily with random searches .",
    "we were able to identify these using theorem  [ thm : vc ] .",

    "in this section , we examine relations among the epimorphisms used in the proofs of the main results ; coverings , abelian extensions and inner representations . as we pointed out , abelian extensions and inner representations are coverings .",
    "we show that there is no other implication :          \\(i ) suppose @xmath4 is faithful , and let @xmath277 be an abelian extension",
    ". then @xmath278 if and only if @xmath279 , where @xmath280 .",
    "hence @xmath281 is an abelian extension , where @xmath282 is isomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "if there is a proper non - trivial subgroup @xmath61 in @xmath39 , then in @xcite it was proved that there is a sequence of abelian extensions @xmath283 .",
    "if @xmath4 is faithful , therefore , @xmath284 is not the inner representation .",
    "an example is given by @xmath285 where @xmath286 and @xmath287 as noted in @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) this was given in @xcite : there it is shown that @xmath288 is not an abelian extension since @xmath289 . another proof that this is not an abelian extension follows from lemma [ lem : criterion ] below .",
    "\\(iii ) consider the product of the two mappings mentioned above : @xmath290 where @xmath291 .",
    "we know that @xmath292 is an inner representation that is not an abelian extension and @xmath285 is an abelian extension that is not an inner representation .",
    "we claim that @xmath293 is a covering but not an abelian extension and not an inner representation .    to see that @xmath293 is not an inner representation note that if @xmath294 denotes the inner representation on a quandle @xmath295 , then @xmath296 thus since @xmath297 is not an inner representation neither is @xmath293 .",
    "since both @xmath119 and @xmath297 are coverings it is easy to see that their product is a covering .",
    "it is more difficult to show that @xmath293 is not an abelian extension . for this",
    "we use the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : criterion ] let @xmath4 and @xmath12 be finite quandles .",
    "assume @xmath298 is an abelian extension , @xmath19 , @xmath299 and @xmath300 . if @xmath301 then @xmath302 acts as the identity on the fiber @xmath133 .",
    "we take @xmath303 , and let @xmath297 be the projection onto @xmath4 . to simplify notation we write the quandle products in @xmath4 and @xmath12 by juxtaposition .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath304 and inductively , for @xmath305 we set @xmath306 .    since @xmath12 is finite for @xmath307 we may write @xmath308 then we have for @xmath309 @xmath310 using the definition of the product in @xmath211 it follows that @xmath311 if we assume that @xmath312 then we have @xmath313 and @xmath314 the fiber @xmath315 is equal to @xmath316 it follows that @xmath317 for all @xmath318 , that is , @xmath302 is the identity on the fiber @xmath319 , as claimed .    now returning to the claim that @xmath320 is not an abelian extension , we note first that computation shows that for @xmath292 there exist @xmath321 , @xmath322 and @xmath323 such that @xmath324 but @xmath325 .",
    "this gives an alternative proof via lemma [ lem : criterion ] that @xmath292 is not an abelian extension .",
    "now to show that @xmath326 is not an abelian extension , we note that using the same @xmath214 and @xmath99 we have that @xmath327 and @xmath328 for any @xmath329 lie in the same fiber of @xmath293 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath330 for any quandles @xmath4 and @xmath12 . thus taking @xmath331 and the identity @xmath332 we have that @xmath333 clearly @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
