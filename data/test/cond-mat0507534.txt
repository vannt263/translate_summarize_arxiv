    "<S> quite a few low - dimensional magnets are quantum - disordered `` spin liquids '' with a characteristic gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum . among these are antiferromagnetic chains of integer quantum spins . </S>",
    "<S> their generic feature are long - lived massive ( gapped ) excitations ( magnons ) that are subject to zeeman splitting in external magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the gap in one of the magnon branches decreases with field , driving a soft - mode quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the system then enters a qualitatively new high - field phase . </S>",
    "<S> the actual properties at high fields , particularly the spin dynamics , critically depend on the system under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> recent neutron scattering studies of organometallic polymer crystals ndmap ( haldane spin chains with anisotropy ) and ntenp ( dimerized @xmath0 chains ) revealed rich and unique physics .     </S>",
