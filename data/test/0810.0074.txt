    "the main task of an experiment in the low energy ( @xmath4 mev ) physics is to study the influence of structure of excited levels of a nucleus on the parameters measured in the experiment , for example of the process of cascade gamma decay .",
    "after that  the extraction of dynamics of intranuclear interactions out of these experimental values and their theoretical interpretation with the development of theoretical models required in practice @xcite for the nuclear parameters used in this case .",
    "this is necessary , in particular , in order to obtain the maximum realistic evaluation of cross sections of interactions of neutrons with nuclei necessary in practice .",
    "this is important especially for actinides where the existing models of level density can not @xcite provide for the maximum reliable and accurate evaluation of cross sections with the absolute minimum of accepted hypotheses and assumptions .    in the stated analysis cycle",
    "the evident insufficiency of experiments sensitive to the structure of nucleus in the widest region of its excitations still remains the main problem . at present , the co - existence , interaction and defining influence of the nuclear excitations of qualitatively differing types , namely multiquasi - particle and vibration ones , on the structure of nuclei give no rise to doubt .",
    "this is the main conclusion of such fundamental models of nucleus as different variants of ibm and qpnm .",
    "unfortunately , the majority of experiments carried out so far give direct and quite reliable information on the structure of nucleus only for too small energies of its excitation . in practice , for example , this region in the even - odd heavy nucleus @xcite is still restricted to the interval of excitation energies of the order of 2 mev",
    ". therefore , there are no direct methods to determine level densities , first of all , at higher excitation energies .",
    "the mentioned parameter of a nucleus , like probability of the gamma quantum emission in the whole region lower than the neutron binding energy or nucleon products of a reaction may only be determined from indirect experiments .",
    "mainly , such analysis uses the spectra of products of a nuclear reaction measured by single detectors .",
    "their amplitude depends both on the number of excited levels and on partial widths of the emission of nuclear reaction products according to the given decay channel of the initial state of an excited nucleus .",
    "the situation is also complicated by the fact that the measured ordinary spectra of one - step reactions are mainly determined by the product of level density of a nucleus on the probability of emission of their products . as a result of strong correlation of these parameters , the transfer of inevitable errors in determination of the spectrum intensity to the unknown values increases abruptly their uncertainties .",
    "this circumstance completely excludes a possibility of simultaneous experimental determination , for example of reliable values of level density @xmath5 in a fixed interval of their spins or of radiative strength functions @xmath6 of cascade gamma transitions , without attraction of any model notions : first of all , without the hypothesis @xcite , which is a basic one for the analysis of all the experiments carried out earlier , on the indepedence of cross section of the inverse reaction on the excitation energy of the final nucleus .",
    "potentially , the task of simultaneous determination of @xmath5 and @xmath7 could be solved for gamma decay of any excited level @xmath8 of an arbitrary nucleus with the mass @xmath9 with any mean spacing @xmath10 between them at the combining of experimental data of different experiments , for example of the cross sections of radiative neutron capture and spectra of gamma rays occurring simultaneously . however , there are no practical achievements in this direction so far .",
    "a fundamentally new method to solve the problem under consideration was realized for the first time @xcite in dubna .",
    "the analysis of intensities of two - step cascades of radiative capture of thermal neutrons in the energy intervals @xmath11 , fixed according to the method @xcite , of their intermediate levels @xmath12 @xmath13 made it possible for the first time to determine @xmath5 and @xmath7 simultaneously and without a model : in the initial variant - on assumption of the independence of partial radiative widths @xmath14 on the excitation energy of the studied nucleus ( i.e. using the hypothesis @xcite ) ; in the modern one @xcite - completely without using it . the indubitable advantage of such experiment is also the circumstence that for any interval of excitation energies @xmath11 the number @xmath15 ( or @xmath16)of levels is fixed by the spin window assigned by an experiment . at the same time",
    "systematic errors @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the determined parameters are restricted very much by the type of spectra measured in the experiment ( in comparison with other methods of similar experiments ) and have a quite acceptable value @xcite for practically attainable systematic errors @xmath19 .",
    "later , similar experiments were carried out in riga , e , los alamos , budapest @xcite and started in dalat .",
    "however , the conclusions of different groups on parameters of the cascade gamma - decay process differ fundamentally depending on the method of experimental data processing used by the authors .",
    "this difference is of purely technical character and may lead to the appearance of false conclusions about the process under investigation only if one does not take into account strong correlation in expression ( 1 ) of the unknown parameters @xmath5 and @xmath7 in the analysis .",
    "errors increase particularly in conclusions of the analysis of experiment when anticorrelations of cascade intensities are neglected with the energies of their primary and secondary gamma transitions located in one and the same interval @xmath11 of each experimental spectrum .",
    "currently , the method @xcite is the only source to obtain reliable data on @xmath5 and @xmath7 for any compound nucleus if only the experimental conditions allow one to limit the energy spread of the excited levels @xmath8 to the interval of the order of 1 - 3 kev and less .",
    "however , in contrast to other already existing methods , here a single - valued determination of the unknown parameters is impossible in principle .",
    "for example , for cascade gamma decay at the neutron capture in resonance the information on experimental intensities of two - step cascades , their density and number of known low - lying levels is available . however , it is impossible to obtain unambiguity in determination of @xmath5 and @xmath7 even using @xcite such additional information as the total ( or only cascade ) population of levels in the low half of neutron binding energy .    a very essential limitation of the region of possible values of level densities and radiative strength functions is provided by non - linearity of equation ( 1 ) relative to @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the non - linearity effect occurs only if its half is extracted @xcite out of the experimental spectrum .",
    "the half equals to the summarized intensity of two - step cascades , which excite intermediate levels in each given interval of their energy .",
    "this very operation during the data processing decreases the interval of values of @xmath5 and @xmath7 , which accurately reproduce @xmath20 from absolutely non - informative ones @xcite to practically accurate values of @xcite @xmath5 and @xmath7 suitable for comparison with the theory .",
    "that is why the analysis @xcite makes it possible to obtain the maximum realistic notions on the dynamics of the process of cascade gamma decay of any nucleus .",
    "however , the existing quite serious discrepancies between the data on @xmath5 and @xmath7 from the technique @xcite and the technique , which is used for a long time , to extract level densities from evaporative spectra point to the necessity of serious comprehensive analysis of both sources of systematic errors in the compared experiments and search of factors , which may influence essentially , in the first place , the determined values of level density .    at present , the problem of studying the influence of structure of wave functions of levels connected by a cascade on its intensity takes on special significance in determination @xcite of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is of special importance for heavy odd - odd compound nuclei where , due to the insufficiency of experimental data on gamma ray spectra in the region @xmath21 , we failed to estimate the degree of discrepancy of radiative strength functions of primary and secondary gamma transitions of one and the same energy and multipolarity .",
    "it is also true for the nuclei maximally close to the actinide region for preliminary evaluation of the conditions , which may distinctly distort the values of @xmath5 and @xmath7 obtained with the help of method @xcite .",
    "the models @xcite of radiative strength functions surpass essentially with regard to the extent of working over and account of structure of a nucleus of the level density models .",
    "the second ones take into account in an explicit form the existence of two fundamentally different types of nuclear excitations , the first ones still use only excitations of the fermion type @xcite . the accumulated data set for each of the nuclei studied in @xcite points to the necessity , at least , of phenomenological inclusion of the contribution from excitations ( or the corresponding components of wave functions)of vibration type into radiative strength function models .    taking into account all these factors ,",
    "the maximum complete data analysis for the compound nucleus @xmath3au is of primary interest .",
    "experimental determination of the total gamma ray spectrum of the radiative neutron capture and its interpretation in the framework of the present - day notions made the authors @xcite conclude that in this nucleus the gamma decay is  anomalous \" : at the gamma transition energy of about 5 mev the so - called  pygmy- resonance \" @xcite manifests itself in the radiative strength function .",
    "this interpretation of the observed increase of the strength function of emission of the corresponding gamma quanta still remains and it became a subject of investigation in @xcite .",
    "notions on the  anomality \" of gamma decay have been obtained and remain only in the framework of the condition that the level density has been determined by now and is described with the help of a model with a rather high accuracy in the whole region of neutron binding energy by a  smooth \" function . from our point of view , no alternative has been considered here .",
    "however , the present - day fully model - free method of simultaneous determination of @xmath5 and @xmath7 @xcite gives another result .",
    "its practical application for more than 20 nuclei from the mass region @xmath22 points to the existence in a nucleus of , at the least , two excitation energies , in which abrupt and fundamentally important change of its structure occurs .",
    "approximation @xcite of the experimental data for @xmath5 by partial level densities of n - quasi - particle excitations shows that this effect with maximum probability may be caused by the breaking of cooper pairs of nucleons in a heated nucleus with practically any mass .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of data @xcite on the spectra of gamma rays of radiative capture of thermal neutrons in @xmath0au has prevented from using the method @xcite to determine @xmath5 and @xmath7 in this nucleus .",
    "both level density and radiative strength functions in @xmath3au have been determined @xcite using only the hypothesis of independence of the radiative strength functions of primary and secondary gamma transitions of one and the same multipolarity and energy on the excitation energy .",
    "the use of this assumption must overestimate the @xmath3au level density determined experimentally in the region of several mev around @xmath23 and underestimate the values of @xmath7 for the appropriate energies of primary gamma transitions .",
    "estimation of the appropriate systematic error may be done on the basis of comparison of the data for @xmath5 from @xcite for the nuclei with a different parity of the number of neutrons and protons .",
    "relative smallness of the obtained error indicates that if we take the value into account it will not lead to a fundamental distortion of conclusions of the analysis of the available data .",
    "nevertheless , it is necessary to perform all possible analysis of the earlier obtained experimental data @xcite for this nucleus , in particular , to estimate the degree of possible difference of radiative strength functions for primary and secondary gamma transitions for various final levels of @xmath3au , and also to estimate the degree of influence of other parameters of this nucleus on experimental cascade intensities and the form of their dependence on the intermediate level energy .",
    "it is very characteristic for the nuclei studied in accordance with the methods @xcite that the change of sum @xmath24 at the change of levels excited by them is of alternating - sign character : a considerable increase of @xmath7 values in the region of  stepped \" structure in the level density of relatively large energies excited by primary transitions of levels is accompanied by some decrease of @xmath7 for low - lying cascade levels .",
    "this effect in an odd - odd nucleus must lead to an overevaluation of calculated cascade intensities at the increase of energy of their final level .",
    "two - step cascade intensities to the levels of @xmath3au with the energy @xmath25 kev required for comparison with the experiment @xcite have been calculated for the following variants of the level density :    \\a ) the back - shifted fermi gas model @xcite ,    \\b ) combination of the ignatiuk model @xcite higher than 2 mev with the experimentally determined number of intermediate cascade levels at smaller excitation energies and    \\c ) the experimental level density from method @xcite . in both variants of the method of simultaneous determination of @xmath5 and @xmath7",
    "the level density of the positive and negative parity is varied independently . however , at the same time the conservation of the average spacing for levels corresponding to s - resonances and the summarized density of  discrete \" levels is provided .",
    "radiative strength functions for e1-transitions are used from results @xcite and models @xcite,@xcite . the model presentation for @xmath26 for the last two variants",
    "is restricted by the case @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding data is given in fig . 1 .    the summarized level density of both parities for spin window @xmath28 is presented in fig .",
    "all the variants of the values @xmath5 , @xmath29 and @xmath26 obtained in accordance with @xcite and presented in fig .",
    "1 and 2 practically precisely reproduce the sum of cascade intensities to levels with the energy less than 514 kev @xcite ( fig .",
    "the comparison of experimental intensities of two - step cascades to specific low - lying levels of @xmath3au for different variants of level densities and radiative strength functions of the gamma transitions is shown in fig .",
    "the signs of random deviations of calculated intensities in different sets of data from @xcite anticorrelate with each other for different final cascade levels .",
    "the deviations of average values from the experimental intensities may be partially related to the systematic errors of determination of the sums of cascade intensities for the given final level . here , there is no reason to exclude a possible dependence of @xmath20 values on @xmath30 , and the influence of details of the structure of wave functions of @xmath31 levels on the average value of @xmath29 and @xmath26 for secondary cascade transitions .",
    "in all the nuclei studied by now the final levels , the spin @xmath32 of which differs from the neutron resonance spin @xmath33 no more than for 2 and has the maximum value at @xmath34 , are excited along with the experimentally observed intensity . for the compound state of @xmath3au excited at the thermal neutron capture @xmath35@xcite ,",
    "therefore , the excess of cascade intensities calculated according to the data @xcite to the final levels @xmath36347 and 406 kev with spins @xmath37 @xcite over the experimental values may be caused by the presence of unresolved doublets and/or the influence of structure of the enumerated levels on @xmath29 and @xmath26 of secondary transitions of the cascades . in any case",
    "this circumstance may not lead to changes of the obtained conclusions on the process of cascade gamma decay due to the relative smallness of excess of the calculated value in comparison with the value @xmath38 observed in the experiment .",
    "if we take into account such possible explanation then the calculation using the data @xcite gives a regular excess of intensity over the experiment for cascades on the levels with the energy @xmath39 kev . due to the lack of other explanations it is possible to accept as the most probable hypothesis that the relation of radiative strength functions of secondary gamma transitions of cascades to the corresponding values for primary ones has the same @xcite form as in even - even nuclei and in even - odd ones .",
    "in other words , the general dynamics of the process of cascade gamma decay of the neutron resonance is characterized by the regularities , which do not depend on the parity of nucleon number in the odd - odd compound nucleus , as well .",
    "the presence of a local increase of radiative strength function in the region of the  stepped structure \" in @xmath5 ( @xmath40 or for primary gamma transitions ( @xmath41 mev ) reflects , most likely @xcite , a considerable increase of the influence of vibration components of levels on its value in the region lower than the threshold of appearance of four - quasi - particle excitations .",
    "radiative strength functions of primary gamma transitions decreased at the breaking of subsequent cooper pairs of nucleons to the levels with four- , six- , etc .",
    "quasi - particle components .    in other words , new models of radiative strength functions must in an explicit form take into account the co - existence and interaction of excitations of quasi - particle and phonon types in the whole region under consideration of excitation energy of a nucleus . in the level density models",
    "this fact is explicitly taken into account , for example @xcite , by introducing the vibration enhancement factor of level density of quasi - particle type .",
    "therefore , most likely , no new types of excitation of nucleus ( of the  pygmy - resonance \" type ) should be proposed and included in the @xmath7 models .",
    "almost the same value of the calculated cascade intensity in the energy region @xmath42 of their intermediate levels for all the tested variants of radiative strength functions and level density demonstrates that the conclusions made in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite by now on the parameters of the process of cascade gamma decay must be in serious error , since they do not take into account a strong correlation of values @xmath5 and @xmath7 , which are included in @xmath20 .    in the framework of the existing notions it is impossible to reach the conformity of the existing and possible models of @xmath5 and @xmath7 with the experiment by any parameter variation , if only they do not take into account quite realistically the influence of breaking of the nucleon cooper pairs on these parameters of the process of cascade gamma decay of the high - excited level .",
    "currently , there are no obstacles in obtaining the experimental data necessary for a rather detailed theoretical description of the properties of nucleus lower than @xmath43 . by analogy with the experience of study of two - step cascades at the thermal neutron capture",
    "one may assume that reliable data on @xmath5 and @xmath7 in other experiments may be obtained only at the study of two - step nuclear reactions in coincidences by high - resolution spectrometers .",
    "erroneous conclusions during the analysis of an experiment of such type may occur only if out - dated model notions on the level density or the probability of emission of nuclear reaction products are used .",
    "the potential models of the level density of a nucleus and radiative strength functions of gamma transitions exciting them must in an explicit form take into account the co - existence and interaction of excitations of quasi - particle and phonon type at least lower than the neutron binding energy .",
    "practical necessity in their development became apparent @xcite at the evaluation of contemporary data on cross sections of the interaction of neutrons with fissionable nuclei .",
