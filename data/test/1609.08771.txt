    "according to the most common active galactic nuclei ( agns ) model , i.e. the unified scheme of agns @xcite , agns consist of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) or a central engine with a rotating dense gas disk or torus surrounding the smbh .",
    "it is generally accepted that pronounced activity in an agn is generated by accreting gas from its torus onto a smbh .",
    "the distribution and kinematics of the circumnuclear gas are keys for understanding the fueling of the agn .",
    "high angular resolution studies of molecular gas in the center of the external galaxies ( radius of @xmath4 1 kpc ) have been obtained with millimeter interferometers .",
    "the size of the circumnuclear torus , however , is smaller than 10 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a milliarcsecond ( mas ) resolution is required to study its internal structure in nearby agns . while conventional millimeter interferometers , even alma , did not achieve such a high angular resolution , vlbi observations have revealed the parsec- or subparsec - scale morphology of nearby agns .",
    "generally , thermal emission lines from molecular gas are not luminous enough to detect with the vlbi .",
    "vlbi maps , however , can display thermal absorption lines of the gas in silhouette against a bright background synchrotron radiation source with a mas resolution .",
    "ngc 1052 is a nearby elliptical galaxy with a systemic velocity ( @xmath5 ) of 1507 km  s@xmath0 @xcite , implying a distance of 20  mpc assuming @xmath6 km  s@xmath0  mpc@xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "its nuclear activity is classified as occurring within a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "vlbi images at 43  ghz , however , show an innermost component in the gap @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed the existence of a parsec - scale circumnuclear torus consisting of cold dense plasma from the convex radio continuum spectra due to the free - free absorption ( ffa ) by the foreground plasma .    besides the ionized gas",
    ", several atomic and molecular gases are also found toward the center of ngc 1052 .",
    "an h@xmath9o megamaser emission is detected at velocities by redshifted 50350 km  s@xmath0 with respect to @xmath10 @xcite , and the h@xmath9o maser gas lies on the inner components in the center of ngc  1052 , where the plasma torus is obscured @xcite .",
    "neutral atomic hydrogen ( ) , oh , hco@xmath11 , hcn , co transitions are found toward the center of ngc  1052 as absorptions @xcite . the velocity range over which those absorption lines are observed spans from 1500 to 1800 km  s@xmath0 , redshifted with respect to @xmath10-like h@xmath9o maser emission .",
    "these facts imply that ionized , neutral , and molecular gases coexist in the vicinity of the central engine .    to investigate the geometry and physical properties of the molecular gas in the circumnuclear region of ngc  1052 , we have performed high - resolution observations toward hcn ( 10 ) absorption lines with the korean vlbi network ( kvn ) .",
    "here we show the first parsec - scale hcn ( 10 ) maps of the center of ngc  1052 .",
    "one milliarcsecond corresponds to 0.095 pc in the galaxy .",
    "kvn observations of ngc  1052 were carried out in 2015 march , for a total on - source time of 7.5 hr . to achieve high sensitivity for the 3  mm hcn ( 10 ) absorption line observation , simultaneous dual - frequency data at the k",
    "( 2170021828 mhz ) and w ( 8864388871 mhz ) bands were recorded using the kvn multi - frequency receiving system @xcite .",
    "two ifs of left hand circular polarization with a bandwidth of 128 mhz were used simultaneously .",
    "one was assigned to the w - band for hcn ( 10 ) , and the other was tuned to the k - band , the reference frequency to track a rapid phase time variation at the w - band .",
    "the velocity coverage of one if at the w - band was @xmath4 400 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "nrao  150 was also observed as a calibrator for phase and bandpass .",
    "the mark5b system at a recording rate of 1024 mbps was used for recording the data .",
    "the correlation was processed at the korea ",
    "japan correlation center @xcite .",
    "we corrected the visibility amplitude decrement due to the digital quantization loss and the characteristics of the kjcc , using the method of @xcite .",
    "calibration , data flagging , fringe fitting , and imaging were performed using the nrao aips software . to track a rapid phase time variation at the w - band",
    ", we analyzed these data using the frequency phase transfer method , in which the phase solutions of the low - frequency band ( k - band ) are transferred to the high - frequency ( w - band ) by scaling by their frequency ratios @xcite .",

    "the continuum was subtracted with the aips task uvlsf in the ( @xmath12 ) domain .",
    "we corrected the visibility phase using self - calibration with the averaged line - free channels , and applied the result of the self - calibration in the absorption line images .",
    "therefore , the absorption and continuum images could be accurately overlaid with positional errors only limited by the thermal noise in the absorption images .",
    "images were produced with natural weighting , and the resulting fwhm of the synthesized beam is @xmath13 mas ( @xmath14 pc in ngc  1052 ) .",
    "the hcn ( 10 ) absorption spectra toward ngc  1052 obtained with the kvn are shown in figure  [ spc ] .",
    "the velocity resolution is 10.5 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "two velocity features of hcn absorption are detected , labeled as i and ii .",

    "the two absorption features are also found in the absorption profile from the pdbi data @xcite .",
    "the velocity widths and the peak velocities agree well with the profile measured using the pdbi , but the absorption depths in the spectral profile with the kvn are deeper than those of the pdbi ( 26@xmath17 ) . although have shown several other absorption features with the depth of @xmath18 around 15001600 km  s@xmath0 from the pdbi data , our kvn data did not detect them significantly .",
    "figure  [ hcnmap ] is a superposition of the line - free continuum image at 89 ghz and the opacity image for each hcn absorption feature .",
    "the continuum image reveals that a nearly symmetric double - sided radio jet structure along the east  west direction is elongated over @xmath40.5 pc ( contour map in figure  [ hcnmap ] ) .",
    "the brightest continuum component is seen at the center of the elongated structure .",
    "the sum of all clean components within 1.4 mas ( the major axis of the synthesized beam ) from the peak is 332 mjy , and it is @xmath19 of the value of the central continuum component at 86 ghz measured in 2004 october by the global millimeter - vlbi array @xcite .",
    "the flux densities for the east and west jet are estimated to be 49 and 180 mjy , respectively .",
    "hcn opacity distribution against the double - sided radio jet structure shows that high opacities ( @xmath20 ) are clearly found on the western receding jet side .",
    "each opacity peak position of the absorption features i and ii is offset by 0.24 and 0.27 pc , respectively , from the continuum peak position , where the central engine is supposed to exist .",

    "this indicates that the hcn covering factor is much smaller on the scale of a few hundreds parsecs .",
    "we estimated the mean opacity over the whole parsec - scale source structure @xmath36 , using @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hcn opacity distribution shown in the color scale of figure  [ hcnmap ] , and @xmath39 is the 89 ghz continuum image .",
    "the estimated @xmath36 is 0.027 and 0.028 for the absorption features i and ii , respectively .",
    "they are on the same order of hcn opacity yielded from the normalized flux of 0.98 and 0.94 for the absorption features i and ii observed with the pdbi @xcite .",
    "thus , the hcn covering factor is likely to be @xmath40 on parsec scales .    under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium , and a covering factor of 1",

    "here we take @xmath53 k and 230 k , as recent millimeter and submillimeter interferometric observations have detected the vibrationally excited hcn emission lines in the dust - enshrouded agn of the luminous infrared galaxies @xcite . the derived h@xmath9 column density ( @xmath54 )",
    "ranges @xmath55@xmath56 @xmath3 , using the values of @xmath57 in table  [ tb : hcn ] .",
    "hence , equivalent @xmath58 would be of the same order as @xmath54 .",
    "it is one or two orders higher than the estimate of the @xmath59 @xmath3 from modeling of x - ray spectra @xcite , and the electron column density of @xmath60 @xmath3 estimated from the ffa opacity of the dense plasma @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that the circumnuclear torus consists of several phase layers . on the inner surface of the torus , a hot ( @xmath61 k )",
    "plasma layer is formed by x - ray emission from the central engine and it causes ffa . a heated ( above @xmath62 k ) molecular layer or x - ray dissociation region ( xdr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lies next to the plasma layer , and the h@xmath9o megamaser emission arises from here . as well as ffa opacity distribution , the hcn opacity shows high values on the western receding side of the jet .",
    "thus , hcn absorbing gas could be associated with the torus , like the dense plasma .",
    "if @xmath46 of hcn is @xmath63 k , hcn molecules should lie in the cooler molecule layer next to xdr .",
    "the redshifted hcn absorption against the continuum emission is likely indicative of ongoing gas infall .",
    "the velocities of the hcn absorption features are close to the centroid velocity of the broad h@xmath9o maser emission ( @xmath64 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , h@xmath9o and hcn could trace the same infall motion inside the torus . the hcn absorption spectrum consists of at least two narrow absorption features , and hcn absorbing gas is more likely to be several small ( @xmath65 0.1 pc ) clumps or layers with a different velocity , rather than a large homogeneous structure with a single velocity .",
    "we have seen the opacity contrast between the absorption features i and ii , and the contrast also suggests the inhomogeneity inside the molecular torus . in figure  [ model ] , we present a possible model for the geometry of the circumnuclear torus and the jet in ngc 1052 .",
    "since the jet axis is inclined from the sky plane , the near side of the torus should cover the receding jet side .",
    "the line of sight intersects at least two hcn gas clumps inside the torus .    as we have mentioned in section [ sec : results ] , there is no significant detection of absorption features around 15001600 km  s@xmath0 , close to @xmath10 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the missing absorption features could arise not from the compact molecular clumps in the circumnuclear region , but from the foreground diffuse interstellar medium in the host galaxy .",
    "if so , their covering factor would not vary on scales between a few parsecs and a few hundreds parsecs , and thus the depth of the absorption features would be @xmath66 , the same as the pdbi results .",
    "it is comparable to the rms noise level of our spectral profile with the kvn , and no significant detection comes as a consequence .",
    "furthermore , when their background continuum sources have a faint and extended structure , the background continuum emissions should be fully resolved - out .",
    "therefore , the absorption features against the resolved - out background sources would be invisible in our kvn data .",
    "we can estimate an approximate size of the foreground absorbing molecular gas using the relation @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the volume filling factor , @xmath69 is the molecular hydrogen volume density , and @xmath70 is the size of the molecular gas .",
    "here we simply assume @xmath71 0.01 . adopting @xmath54 of @xmath55@xmath56 @xmath3 from our results and",
    "@xmath69=(0.12)@xmath72 @xmath73 in the galactic cnd @xcite , the resulting @xmath70 is approximately on 1-pc scales .",
    "it is consistent with the approximate size of the circumnuclear torus of ngc  1052 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of the innermost receding jet component can be estimated as 0.20.4 mas from the vlba images at 43 ghz @xcite , and it corresponds to 0.020.04 pc in linear scale .    based on our measurements of the radial velocities and the distribution of hcn absorption features , the mass infall rate of the gas accretion toward the central engine can be estimated by @xmath74 , where @xmath68 is the volume filling factor , @xmath75 is an infall radius , @xmath76 is the mass density of the infalling materials , @xmath77 is the infall velocity , and @xmath78 is the solid angle of the torus from the center . here",
    "we assume @xmath79 , where @xmath58 is the column density of a hydrogen atom and @xmath80 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . giving @xmath81 1 pc , @xmath82",
    "@xmath55@xmath56 @xmath3 , and @xmath83 200 km  s@xmath0 as the approximate velocity of the hcn absorption feature with respect to @xmath10 ( @xmath84 in table  [ tb : hcn ] ) , the derived mass infall rate ranges @xmath85 ( 47470 ) @xmath86 yr@xmath0 . if ( @xmath87 ) takes a few 0.1 and @xmath68 is 0.01 , it would be comparable to the calculation of the accretion rate of @xmath88 yr@xmath0 from the hard x - ray luminosities by @xcite .",
    "we note that the x - ray luminosity indicates an instantaneous accretion rate",
    ". however , our estimation of the accretion rate in the molecular torus gives a long - term ( @xmath89 year ) activity .",
    "the coincidence of the two accretion rate values suggests the continuity of agn activity in ngc  1052 .",
    "we have conducted 1 mas angular - resolution observations toward the hcn(10 ) absorption of the circumnuclar region in ngc  1052 with the kvn .",
    "two hcn absorption features are identified and reach a depth of @xmath90 from the continuum level at 1656 and 1719 km  s@xmath0 , redshifted with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "we find an @xmath57 of @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath3 in the center of ngc  1052 , assuming an hcn covering factor of 1 and a @xmath46 of 100230 k. the hcn opacity distribution against the double - sided radio continuum jet structure shows a localization of the hcn high opacity on the receding jet side .",
    "the size of the foreground absorbing molecular gas is estimated to be approximately on 1-pc scales .",
    "we argue that these results are most naturally explained by a circumnuclear torus that consist of several phase layers , perpendicular to the jet axis of ngc  1052 .",
    "hcn absorbing gas distribution could be clumpy , and could be associated with the cooler molecular region inside the torus .",
    "the redshifted velocities of the hcn absorption features account for the infall motion onto the central engine , such as an h@xmath9o megamaser emission .",
