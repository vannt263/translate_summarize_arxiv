    "recently , it has been shown from the enskog kinetic theory that a mixture of inelastic hard spheres also has a hcs under the same conditions @xcite .",
    "the condition that all time dependence occurs through the temperature requires that the cooling rates for the kinetic temperatures for each species must be the same .",

    "the enskog equations with boundary conditions can be written as @xcite @xmath164 \\ ; ,   \\label{a.1}\\ ] ] here , @xmath165 describes interactions of particles of type @xmath26 with the boundaries @xmath166 this is similar to the usual boltzmann collision operator with the first term representing a gain in the population of particles with velocity @xmath38 due to collisions with the wall and the second term representing a corresponding loss . the probability density for a velocity @xmath38 after the collision with the wall , given an incident velocity @xmath167 has the form @xmath168 the two theta functions characterize incident particles as directed toward the wall and reflected particle directed away from the wall , where the normal @xmath169 is directed toward the interior of the system .",
    "the kernel @xmath170 characterizes the change in the half space velocity distributions at the surface ( i.e. , outgoing distribution is a linear functional of the incoming distribution ) .",
    "particle number conservation requires @xmath171 as an illustration , the form of @xmath172 for elastic specular collisions with a wall at rest is @xmath173    the surface domain @xmath174 is time dependent , representing vertical oscillations .",
    "this can be handled using a sawtooth form for the driving , such that every particle encounters the wall moving into the system at velocity @xmath175 .",
    "assume the amplitude of the vibration is small so that the displacement of the wall can be neglected .",
    "then , it is reasonable to choose specular collisions in the local galillean frame for which the wall is at rest : @xmath176 @xmath177 the wall collision operator becomes @xmath178    the change in the kinetic energy due to the boundary conditions is @xmath179 \\left| \\widehat{{\\bf n}}\\cdot \\left ( { \\bf   v}_1-{\\bf v}_{w}\\right)\\right| \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\theta ( -\\widehat{{\\bf n}}\\cdot \\left({\\bf v}_1-{\\bf v}_{w}\\right ) ) f_{i}^{(1)}({\\bf s},{\\bf v}_1;t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are the kinetic energies for particles coming into and leaving the surface .",

    "the rate of energy change due to the wall becomes @xmath186 if the wall speed is much larger than other characteristic velocities , @xmath187 , and so eq .  ( [ a.10 ] ) becomes approximately @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the area of the wall and @xmath190 is the density of incident particles of species @xmath26 . the rate of change of the temperature is then @xmath191 which gives the steady state condition ( [ 5.3 ] ) .    another estimate is given by representing the incident distribution as a gaussian @xmath192 \\left ( \\mathop{\\rm erf } \\left ( v_{w}^{\\ast } -v_{2}^{\\ast   } \\right ) + 1\\right ) \\right )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath193 @xmath194 characterizes the temperature of the incident particles and @xmath195 characterizes their mean speed toward the wall . for large @xmath196 the condition ( [ a.12 ] )",

    "haff s law is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the scaling of the hcs . in principle there could be a locally inhomogeneous state such that the total energy is the sum of the thermal energy plus the kinetic energy of convective flows .",
    "it is possible that both contributions could decay with the same power law as in haff s law , but with a different cooling rate @xmath22 . in fact , there is some indication that this may occur in the late stages of instability for the hcs ( j. wakou , r. brito , and m. h. ernst , cond - mat/0103086 ) .",
