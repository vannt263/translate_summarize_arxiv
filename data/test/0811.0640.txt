    "eclipsing binaries ( hereafter ebs ) are excellent objects for determining the physical properties of stars and detecting additional components in them .",
    "the long - time behavior of the period of an eb could reveal the presence of another component orbiting with the eb around the common center of mass .",
    "photometric observations of ebs sometimes cover more than a century , therefore it is possible to detect the third bodies with a similar period .",
    "the motion around the barycenter causes apparent changes of the observed binary s period with a period corresponding to the orbital one of the third body , called the light - time effect ( or light - travel time , hereafter lite ) .",
    "@xcite improved the method developed by @xcite for analyzing the long - term variation of the times of minima caused by a third body orbiting the eclipsing pair .",
    "useful comments and limitations were discussed by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "nowadays there are more than one hundred ebs showing lite , where the effect is certainly presented or supposed ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "see the catalogue of the @xmath0 diagrams by @xcite , where the apparent orbital period changes in many ebs are presented .",
    "the look of @xmath0 diagrams in the present study was adopted to be the same as in this catalogue . in our figures [ figwzand1 ] to [ figahtau ]",
    "the full circles represent the primary and the open circles the secondary times of minima , the bigger the point , the bigger the weight . for the limitations and consequences of the @xmath0 diagram analysis , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the computation of the parameters of the third - body orbit is a classical inverse problem with 5 parameters to be found ",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , which indicate the period of the third body , the periastron passage , the semi - amplitude of the light - time effect , the argument of periastron and the eccentricity , respectively ( for a detailed description see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ephemerides for the individual systems ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the linear one and @xmath8 for the quadratic one ) have to be calculated together with the parameters of lite . the mass function @xmath9 and the minimal mass of the third component @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 ) could be computed from this set of parameters .",
    "the weights assigned to individual observations were used as following : @xmath12 for visual observations , 3 - 5 for photographic and 10 for ccd and photoelectric observations .",
    "the computing code , used in the present work , could be downloaded via the webpages of the authorzasche/ ] ] .",
    "the present study was carried out following a similar analysis of period changes in algol - type binaries ( made by @xcite ) .",
    "all the systems selected for this paper are contact ebs , of w  uma or @xmath13  lyr type , with components of similar spectral types ( ranging from f to k ) . except for a few new observations given in table [ minima ] , all the times of minima used in this paper",
    "were collected from the published literature and from minima databases available in the internet .    according to a recent paper on the period changes in algols by @xcite",
    ", there could be a connection between the spectral type of the secondary component and the nature of the period changes .",
    "systems with spectral types of secondaries later than f5 show @xmath0 variations , which could be caused by magnetic activity cycles and convective envelopes .",
    "this effect was discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "the role of the magnetic cycles in the period changes is discussed below , but , due to lack of information about the systems , such an analysis is a difficult task .",
    "for some of the systems studied in this paper the spectral types of the secondaries are known with a low confidence level , light - curve analysis is missing and spectroscopy has never been done .",
    ".new times of minima based on ccd observations ( kwee - van woerden ( @xcite ) method was used ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the new measurements were secured at the athens university observatory , which is situated at athens university campus , athens , greece .",
    "the 40-cm telescope is equipped with the sbig st-8xmei ccd camera and the bessell ubvri photometric filters .",
    "all of the observations were obtained from december of 2006 to april 2008 .",
    "the exposure times depend on the individual systems and observing conditions , ranging from 25 to 80 seconds .",
    "the first analyzed system is the eclipsing binary wz  and ( gsc  02799 - 01250 ) .",
    "this @xmath13  lyrae system is about 11.6 mag bright in @xmath14 filter @xcite and its spectrum was classified as f5 + g3 ( according to @xcite ) .",
    "it was discovered to be a variable by miss leavitt , see @xcite , and its eclipsing nature was confirmed by zessewitsch ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent detailed analysis of the light curve of this system was made by @xcite , which indicates that the system is in a shallow contact and has the photometric mass ratio about 1 .",
    "regrettably , the radial velocity curve has not been obtained so far .",
    "the first minima observations are more than a century old .",
    "altogether there are about 400 minima , but for the current analysis 37 of them were neglected due to their large scatter .",
    "the previous period analysis of this system was performed by @xcite , who suggested a few period jumps and mass transfer between the two components .",
    "they were not able to fit a sinusoidal curve to those data , because the period variation is more complicated .",
    "also the previous analyses by @xcite and @xcite presented a quadratic ephemeris to describe the variation in the @xmath0 diagram .    with the new larger data set ,",
    "one is able to identify a double variation in the @xmath0 diagram , where the first one is caused by a third and the second one by a fourth body in the system ( see fig.[figwzand1 ] for the plot of the @xmath0 diagram with the final fit ) .",
    "the @xmath0 variation , due only to the fourth body is given in fig.[figwzand2 ] .",
    "these variations have a period of about 70 and 50 years respectively and their parameters are given in table [ tablebig1 ] .",
    "the total mass of the binary is @xmath15  @xmath16  ( according to @xcite ) . using this mass",
    ", one could calculate the mass function and the minimal masses of the third and also the fourth component ( see table [ tablebig1 ] ) .",
    "these masses , assuming that the additional components belong to the ms , indicate their spectral types should be about m3 and m5 , respectively .",
    "their contribution to the total light is negligible ( below 1% ) , but in the red part of the spectrum could be detectable .",
    "the distance of this system is about 440  pc @xcite , so the predicted angular separation and the magnitude difference between the additional components and the eb can also be estimated .",
    "the angular separation results in 52 and 45  mas , respectively , which is well within the limits for a detection by modern stellar interferometers . on the other hand , due to their relatively low masses ( and therefore also their luminosities ) , the magnitude differences between them and the eb result in high values about 5  mag for the third and 6  mag for the fourth component .",
    "such large magnitude differences make extremely difficult the discovery of such distant components .",
    "if there are more than 3 components in the system , then a question arises not only about the dynamical stability of such a system , but also about the suitability of the period analysis to find such bodies .",
    "the method of lite itself was derived on the basis of von zeipel s method for the three - body problem , where the assumption that the third body is far away from the eclipsing pair does play the main role .",
    "this condition in the present case is not satisfied , so it is problematic to judge whether this method could be used for such an analysis .",
    "the eb system v803  aql is a neglected w  uma - type system , with an orbital period about 0.3  days and a depth of both primary and secondary minima about 0.8  mag .",
    "it is relatively faint binary , only about 14  mag in @xmath14 filter and the spectral types of the components were found to range between k3 to k5 ( see @xcite )",
    ". the only detailed analysis of its light curve was made by @xcite , who derived that both components are very similar to each other , but also proposed a possible explanation of its period changes due to the mass loss from the system caused by a stellar wind .",
    "the new set of times of minima comprises 150 data points , from which 4 visual ones were neglected due to their large scatter .",
    "the six minima times from @xcite were corrected for their heliocentric correction and fit better the theoretical curve of the lite variation ( see fig.[figv803aql ] ) .",
    "such a variation is caused by a third body orbiting about the eb pair on its 75  yr circular orbit .",
    "the parameters of the orbit are given in table [ tablebig2 ] , and these values yielded a third - body mass about 0.5  @xmath16 . with the assumption that the third component is a main sequence star ,",
    "one gets its spectral type about k8 .",
    "such a body could be detectable in the light curve analysis , as well as in the spectra of the system .",
    "regrettably , no spectral analysis has been performed so far and @xcite did not include the third light parameter in their light curve analysis .    despite the fact that the distance of the system is not known , one can estimate a photometric parallax of v803  aql on the basis of its spectral type and luminosity .",
    "the distance is therefore about 300  pc , from which one could estimate the predicted angular separation of the third component to be 75  mas and its magnitude difference about 2  mag .",
    "such values allow for the discovery of the @xmath17 body using modern interferometric technique .",
    "another eb showing period changes is the system df  hya ( an  343.1934).it is about 10.7  mag bright in @xmath14 filter , it has an orbital period about 0.3  days and belongs in the w  uma - type systems .",
    "it was discovered as a variable star by @xcite , who classified the system as a short - period variable star .",
    "the most recent detailed analysis of its light curve was published by @xcite , who also derived its basic physical properties . due to the asymmetric shape of its light curve ,",
    "both primary and secondary components were found to have magnetic spots and the spectral type of the system was assumed to be g0v .",
    "the basic physical parameters of the system derived by @xcite are comparable with those derived by @xcite .    as an explanation of the period changes in this system , all the previous period analyses proposed a mass transfer between the two components @xcite , or abrupt period jumps @xcite . with the new set of up - to - date times of minima ,",
    "counting altogether 143 data points , one is able to identify the long - term variation to be periodic instead of the steady increase caused by a mass transfer .",
    "especially , the new data points after the year 2000 evidently deviate from the quadratic ephemeris ( see fig.[figdfhya ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the lite are given in table [ tablebig2 ] , the final fit is given in fig.[figdfhya ] and the predicted third - body s minimal mass results in 0.84  @xmath16 . assuming the component to be a main - sequence star ,",
    "then it should be of k1 spectral type and therefore a third light should be considered in the light curve solution .",
    "such a third light was not included in the light curve solution of @xcite . using the same method as in the case of v803  aql",
    ", one could also estimate the value of the photometric distance of the additional component resulting in 190  pc , which yields the predicted angular separation of 135  mas and a magnitude difference from the eb of about 1.3  mag . such a star could be easily detectable with the modern stellar interferometers .",
    "the eclipsing binary system py  lyr ( gsc  02136 - 03365 ) is of w  uma - type and its magnitude is about 12.5 in @xmath18 filter . both primary and secondary minima",
    "are about 0.6  mag deep and the orbital period is about 0.4  d. its spectral type was classified as f0 @xcite , but it is only a preliminary one .",
    "precise ccd observations were carried out by @xcite , but they did nt include the third light into their analysis .",
    "the radial velocities have not been measured , but many papers have been published with times of minima .",
    "information about a possible period change is given by @xcite , who noticed some modulation of its orbital period , but they concluded that this variation is uncertain .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite published a paper on py  lyr , where the period changes were described by two period jumps  near 1967 and 1987 .",
    "collecting all the minima times , one gets a set of 123 data points .",
    "fig.[figpylyr ] represents the @xmath0 diagram of all these measurements , where the period variation is clearly visible .",
    "a period of about 50  years is now well covered and the resulting parameters of the predicted lite variation are given in table [ tablebig1 ] .",
    "assuming that the mass of the eclipsing pair is about 2.5  @xmath16  ( according to its spectral type ) , the minimal mass of the predicted third component results in 1.17  @xmath16 , which is approximately the same value of mass as the primary and secondary component .",
    "therefore , the third light can be easily detectable in the light curve solution",
    ". regrettably , the parallax and the distance to this system is not known , but it could be estimated using the same method as in the previous case .",
    "the value of the system s photometric distance results in 750  pc , therefore the predicted angular separation of the third component is about 29  mas and its magnitude difference from the eb is about 1.3  mag",
    ". such a component would be hardly observable interferometrically .",
    "the photometric data obtained by one of us ( v.m . ) , we reanalysed again by taking into consideration the third body s contribution to the total light of the system .",
    "the software phoebe 0.29d , which is based on the wilson - devinney code , was used in order to extract the new model of the system .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 observations of this system were analyzed ( see fig.[figpylyrlc ] ) , yielding a new set of physical parameters given in table [ table3 ] , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denote the temperature , the luminosity , the modified kopal potential , and the limb - darkening coefficients for primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "the `` mode 3 '' was used for computing ( hence @xmath25 = @xmath26 ) and the eccentricity was set to 0 ( circular orbit ) .",
    "the value of temperature of the primary component was assumed from its spectral type .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficients were interpolated from van  hamme s tables ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the values of gravity brightening and bolometric albedo coefficients were set at their suggested values for convective atmospheres ( see @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "also the synchronous rotation was assumed for each star ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "a spot in the primary component has been used due to the presence of the oconnell effect . the contribution of the third light to the total luminosity of the system is significant .",
    "its value from the light curve solution results in approximately ( 19.7 @xmath305)% . on the other hand ,",
    "the value predicted according to the lite variation is about ( 23 @xmath30 5)% , so it is in very good agreement with each other .",
    "the eb system fz ori ( hd  288166 ) has been discovered to be a variable by @xcite .",
    "it is a w  uma - type system with an orbital period of about 0.4  days and a brightness of about 10.8  mag in @xmath14 filter .",
    "its spectral type was estimated as g0 @xcite .",
    "the light curve of the star was analyzed a few times in the past , but no one of the analyses has been very detailed .",
    "one of them was published by @xcite and the most recent one by @xcite .",
    "both of these studies indicate a slightly asymmetric light curve , which was explained in the latter paper by the presence of a spot on the primary component .",
    "a period analysis was performed by @xcite , who also mentioned a possible cyclic changing of the period , but no satisfactory solution was presented .",
    "our new period analysis is based on a much larger data set , containing 153 times of minima . from these measurements it is possible to identify the steady period increase besides the cyclic variation of its orbital period with a periodicity of about 50  yrs ( see fig.[figfzori ] for the @xmath0 fit and table [ tablebig2 ] for the final parameters ) . according to the value of the quadratic - term coefficient",
    ", one gets surprisingly high value of conservative mass transfer rate between the components , of about @xmath31  @xmath16/yr .",
    "a similar result is also presented in @xcite , where the authors deduce that the system is now in the stage of mass transfer .",
    "assuming that the masses of the primary and secondary components are @xmath32  @xmath16   and @xmath33  @xmath16   ( according to @xcite ) respectively , minimal mass of the third body results in 0.65  @xmath16 .",
    "such a component could be probably detectable in the light curve solution and also could be evident in the spectrum of the system , but no such attempt has been carried out so far .",
    "its photometric distance results in approximately 250  pc , and therefore the predicted angular separation is about 75  mas , while the magnitude difference from the eb is about 2.8  mag .",
    "a detection of such a component is hence near the limits of the current interferometric techniques .",
    "ah tau is an eclipsing binary of w  uma - type , its apparent brightness is about 11.4  mag in @xmath14 filter , its orbital period is about 0.33  days and the spectral type was classified as g1p @xcite .",
    "the first photographic light curve was observed and briefly analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the most detailed analysis of its light curve was presented in @xcite , resulting in a set of basic physical parameters .",
    "a period analysis was performed by @xcite , who also noticed variable period changes and they concluded that their existence was due to the magnetic activity , the mass loss and the radius swelling of the components . our new data set consists of more data points ( 204 times of minima ) .",
    "the final @xmath0 diagram fitted by the theoretical curves is displayed in fig.[figahtau ] and the final lite parameters are given in table [ tablebig2 ] .",
    "the parabolic curve due to the steady period decrease could not fit very well the most recent data points , but lite hypothesis is able to describe also the behavior of the newest observations .",
    "the lite parameters lead to the predicted value of the third mass , resulting in 0.51  @xmath16 .",
    "contribution of such a body could be observable in a precisely measured light curve of this system",
    ". @xcite also derived a photometric parallax of this system , resulting in a value of 281  pc , which yields the predicted angular distance of such body of about 83  mas , which is within the limits for the modern stellar interferometers . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude difference between the third component and the eclipsing pair is about 3.7  mag , which is too high to expect such a body to be discovered .",
    "the o - c residuals show additional non - periodic variations in the @xmath0 diagrams , which can not be described by applying only the lite hypothesis .",
    "the residuals in figs .",
    "[ figwzand1 ] to [ figahtau ] show also additional variations with variable periods and amplitudes much lower than that of lite .",
    "these could be caused by the presence of stellar convection zones , in an agreement with the so - called applegate s mechanism , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "such an effect could play a role , because the spectral types of many of the components are later than f5 ( see @xcite for a detailed analysis ) . to conclude , for a better description of the observed period variations of these systems",
    ", the magnetic activity cycles could be present together with the lite .",
    "on the other hand , one has to take into consideration that the spectral types of most of these binaries were not derived from their spectra , but only on the basis of their photometric indices and therefore are not very reliable .",
    "the only system , where one could estimate the variation of the quadruple moment ( see @xcite ) required to explain the long - term period variations , is ah  tau , where the semi - major axis of the orbit from the light curve solution is known .",
    "using the following equation @xmath34 @xcite one could compute the amplitude of the period oscillation .",
    "the period variation @xmath35 can be used for calculating the variation of the quadruple moment @xmath36 , using the equation @xcite @xmath37 this quantity results in @xmath38  g@xmath39@xmath40 , which is not inside the limits for active binaries ( range of values from @xmath41 to @xmath42  g@xmath39@xmath40 ) and therefore the variation in ah  tau could not be explained by this mechanism .",
    "six contact eclipsing binaries were analyzed for the presence of lite on the basis of their @xmath0 diagram analysis and the times - of - minima variations .",
    "a few new observations of these systems were obtained and used in the present analysis .",
    "all of the studied systems show apparent changes of their orbital periods , which could be explained as a result of a third component orbiting the eb around their common center of mass .",
    "such a variation has usually a period of the order of decades , as one can see from figs.[figwzand1][figahtau ] , which can be described by applying the lite hypothesis sufficiently . in the case of fz  ori the quadratic term in the light elements",
    "was also used .",
    "this could be explained as a mass transfer between the two components , which is a common procedure in contact systems .",
    "the conservative mass - transfer rate was calculated .",
    "regrettably , in most of the above systems no detailed analysis ( neither photometric nor spectroscopic ) has been made so far .",
    "the spectral types and the masses of the individual components in the systems are only approximate , so the parameters of the predicted third bodies are also affected by relatively large errors . due to missing information about the distances to these binaries ,",
    "we have used a photometric parallax for the distance determination and therefore also the predicted angular separations of the third components could be estimated .",
    "it is obvious that only further detailed photometric , as well as spectroscopic and interferometric analysis would reveal the nature of these systems and confirm or reject the third - body hypothesis .",

    "<S> six contact binaries lacking a period analysis have been chosen to search for the presence of a third body . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 diagrams of these binaries were analyzed with the least - squares method by using all available times of minima . </S>",
    "<S> ten new minima times , obtained from our observations , were included in the present research . </S>",
    "<S> the light - time effect was adopted for the first time as the main cause for the detailed description of the long - term period changes . </S>",
    "<S> third bodies were found with orbital periods from 49 up to 100  years , and eccentricities from 0.0 to 0.56 for the selected binaries . in one case ( wz  and ) </S>",
    "<S> a fourth - body lite variation was also applied . </S>",
    "<S> the mass functions and the minimal masses of such bodies were also calculated and a possible angular separation and magnitude differences were discussed for a prospective interferometric discovery of these bodies . </S>"
