    "the local coulomb interaction @xmath6 of electrons occupying quantum dots leads to a variety of effects .",
    "many of them can conveniently be studied in transport through the dot within the linear regime .",
    "theoretically as well as experimentally well - investigated examples are the coulomb blockade ( cb ) peaks of the transmission ( conductance ) @xcite as well as the plateaus of width @xmath2 of the transmission ( conductance ) induced by the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "additional features of interacting multi - level dots that have recently attracted considerable theoretical attention are the population inversions of the dot levels @xcite , the phase lapses of the transmission phase @xmath1 or , equivalently , the zeros of the transmission amplitude @xmath7 ( transmission zeros ) @xcite and additional correlation - induced resonances of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "they appear in certain parts of the parameter space when the level occupancies and the transmission amplitude are investigated as functions of the level positions , which can be tuned via a nearby plunger gate voltage .",
    "such effects were hitherto mostly studied in a minimal model involving only two levels . a very important step towards a unified understanding of population inversions , phase lapses and correlation - induced resonancess in spin - polarized two - level dots",
    "was recently taken by a multi - stage mapping of the problem on a generalized kondo model and a subsequent renormalization group and bethe ansatz analysis of the effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of phase lapses ( transmission zeros ) are of primary interest in connection with a series of linear response transmission measurements by the weizman group @xcite on aharonov - bohm rings containing a quantum dot in one arm . under suitable conditions",
    "both the phase @xmath1 and magnitude @xmath8 of the transmission amplitude @xmath9 of the dot can be extracted from the aharonov - bohm oscillations of the current through the ring @xcite . when this is done as function of a plunger gate voltage @xmath10 that linearly shifts the dot s single - particle energy levels downward , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is a level index ) , a series of well - separated cb peaks of rather similar width and height was observed in @xmath13 , across which @xmath14 continuously increased by @xmath0 , as expected for breit - wigner - like resonances . in each cb valley between any two successive peaks , @xmath1 always jumped sharply downward by @xmath0 .",
    "this phase lapse behavior was found to be `` universal '' , occurring in a large succession of valleys for every _ many_-electron dot studied in refs .",
    "this universality is puzzling , since naively the behavior of @xmath15 is expected to be `` mesoscopic '' , i.e.  to show a phase lapse in some cb valleys and none in others , depending on the dot s shape , the parity of its orbital wavefunctions , etc . only recently @xcite , also",
    "the _ few_-electron regime was probed experimentally : as @xmath10 was increased to successively fill up the dot with electrons , starting from electron number @xmath16 , @xmath14 was observed to behave mesoscopically in the _ few_-electron regime , whereas the above - mentioned universal phase lapse behavior emerged only in the _ many_-electron regime @xmath17 .    it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that a generic difference between the few- and many - electron dots may be that for the latter , transport might simultaneously occur through several partially filled single - particle levels in parallel .",
    "a possible reason could be that the mean ( non - interacting ) level spacing @xmath4 of the topmost filled levels decreases as the number of electrons increases , while the charging energy @xmath2 still implies well separated transmission resonances @xcite .",
    "this scenario forms the basis of a recent systematic study by us of the interplay of level spacing , level width and charging energy on the phase lapses for up to four interacting levels and spin - polarized electrons @xcite .",
    "we showed that the universal phase lapse and transmission zero behavior appearing at small @xmath4 can be understood as resulting from a fano - type interference effect @xcite involving transport through two or more effective dot levels , whose position and width have been renormalized by the coulomb interaction and coupling to the leads .",
    "the importance of several overlapping levels for phase lapses had earlier been pointed out by silvestrov and imry in a rather specific model of a single wide and several narrow levels with strong interaction @xcite .    here",
    "we supplement our earlier study @xcite by discussing the relation between phase lapses and population inversions and by investigating the role of finite temperatures @xmath18 as well as spin , focusing on @xmath19 levels .",
    "when spin is included , the kondo effect plays a role for an odd average occupation of the dot , but the phase lapse scenario is unaffected by this .",
    "experimentally the behavior of the phase in the presence of the kondo effect was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we are concerned with the _ generic _ behavior and thus investigate the entire parameter space , going beyond subspaces of higher symmetry [ such as left - right ( l - r ) or 1 - 2 symmetry of the coupling between the left and right leads and the two levels ] . for low temperatures and sufficiently small single - particle spacings @xmath4 of the dot levels",
    ", we find @xmath0 phase lapses between two transmission peaks in an overwhelmingly large part of the parameter space of the level - lead couplings .",
    "we point out that the two level case is special compared to models with @xmath20 , as for generic level - lead couplings a transmission zero and phase lapse occurs between the two transmission peaks _ even at _ u=0 . the effect of the interaction is merely to increase the separation of the transmission peaks . for large @xmath4 the appearance or not of phase lapses between transmission peaks",
    "depends on the relative sign of the level - lead couplings in analogy to the noninteracting case @xcite .    for spin - polarized dots",
    "we in addition compare our @xmath21 results with the ones of recent mean - field studies @xcite . in these works level - lead couplings beyond the subspaces with increased symmetry were studied , and a remarkably more complex behavior was found once the symmetries were broken .",
    "the importance of considering such generic parameter sets was independently pointed out in ref .",
    "we here elucidate how the phase lapse behavior is affected by quantum fluctuations , which are expected to be strong in low - dimensional systems .",
    "we find that upon including quantum fluctuations , the part of parameter space exhibiting universal @xmath0 phase lapses between well separated cb peaks becomes larger than suggested by the mean - field study .",
    "in particular , we do not recover certain peculiar features of the mean - field results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , namely the occurrence , in certain regimes of parameter space , of a phase lapse of less than @xmath0 ( instead of precisely @xmath0 ) , accompanied by the disappearance of the corresponding transmission zero @xcite .",
    "these features thus turn out to be artifacts of the mean - field approximation , which misses the rather simple scenario for the phase lapse behavior of a two - level dot at small @xmath4 : for generic level - lead couplings a phase lapse and transmission zero between two transmission peaks is already present at @xmath5 ; increasing the coulomb interaction the peaks become well separated while the phase lapse and transmission zero remain in the valley between them .    in the model of a single wide and several narrow levels",
    "@xcite a relation between phase lapses and population inversions was discussed .",
    "therefore , in phase lapse studies quite often also the level occupancies @xmath22 , @xmath23 , are investigated .",
    "we emphasize that the generic appearance of a phase lapse and transmission zero even at @xmath5 renders the two - level model unsuitable for establishing a general relation between phase lapses and population inversions , as the latter only appear at sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we show that discontinuities of the @xmath22 as a function of @xmath10 are an artifact of the mean - field solution ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) . within our approaches",
    "discontinuities are only found for l - r symmetric level - lead couplings with a relative plus sign of the underlying hopping matrix elements and degenerate levels , a case which was earlier identified as being nongeneric @xcite , because the transmission shows only a single peak .",
