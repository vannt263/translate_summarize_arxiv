    "nucleon system in the non  perturbative region of qcd is of great topical relevance to nuclear and particle physics .",
    "cosy represents a unique environment to perform studies of this kind , in particular measurements of polarization observables in heavy meson production reactions , as emphasized recently @xcite .",
    "measurements of those polarization observables are to be considered which are associated with the spins of the particles in the entrance channel , since the polarization of particles in a final state in most cases is difficult to access .      when producing a meson close to threshold , the transferred momentum is large .",
    "in addition , angular  momentum constraints require a head  on collision ( small impact parameter ) . from this",
    ", it is clear that such a reaction is sensitive to the nn interaction at distances of less than 1 fm , while the long  range part is suppressed , thus the reaction acts as a filter for short  range features of the nucleon  nucleon interaction . in hindsight , we can understand why the first precise measurement of the total cross section in @xmath3 @xcite resulted in a challenge for theorists .",
    "for the very same reasons , near  threshold production of mesons heavier than the pion is a promising field of nuclear research .",
    "in addition , the interaction of the produced meson with the hadrons in the exit channel can be studied , and one expects to learn about the coupling of mesons to nucleons .",
    "the production of a meson in nn collisions close to the production threshold involves only a few transitions between a given initial and final angular momentum state .",
    "these transitions can be labeled by the angular momentum of the nn pair ( @xmath4 ) and the angular momentum of the meson with respect to the nucleon pair ( @xmath5 ) in the exit channel .",
    "close to threshold @xmath5 and @xmath4 can be either 0 or 1 .",
    "this scheme results for @xmath6 for instance in the possible combinations @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "parity and angular  momentum conservation forbid @xmath10 final states . as the incident proton energy is lowered further , eventually only a single transition into @xmath7",
    "becomes possible .",
    "[ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     [ table2 ]      navely , one would think that near  threshold meson production in @xmath1 collisions can be fully understood in terms of a short  ranged @xmath11 process , with the extra nucleon acting as a spectator .",
    "recently , however , pion production in @xmath1 collisions has revealed departures from such a simple picture @xcite .",
    "these studies are in their infancy and deserve more attention from the theoretical community .",
    "since the number of participating amplitudes in this case , too , is small , even though the transferred momentum is large , we have a unique environment in which to study the interaction of more than just two nucleons , e.g. three  nucleon forces .",
    "it is likely that eventually the research on three  nucleon forces will focus on this process .",
    "again , the role of polarization observables is important , but practically no such data are available . in the case of pion production ,",
    "measurements with vector and tensor polarized deuterons and polarized protons are carried out at iucf . for the production of heavier mesons ,",
    "cosy again is in a position to dominate the field in the years to come .      even though , clearly , the main motivation in designing a new facility is arising from the need for polarization observables in meson production , one needs to also mention future possibilities , which would include the @xmath1 breakup reaction @xcite as well as radiative transitions .",
    "besides what has been presented so far , a truly unique application of a gas target would be the use of polarized deuterons as an effective polarized neutron target by detection of low energetic spectator protons .",
    "the purpose of these measurements would be the generation of a solid @xmath12 database and , as mentioned above , a detailed study of meson production in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "these studies hinge on the availability of a spectator detector system , by which energy _ and _ angle information about the spectator proton have to be measured along the extended storage cell target @xcite .",
    "in addition , three body final states involving strange mesons ( @xmath13 ) and baryons ( @xmath14 ) , for instance in the reaction @xmath15 , could be studied with polarized beam and target .",
    "near threshold only a limited angular range in the forward direction needs to be covered . however , the momenta of the particles in the exit channel increase with the threshold of the mesons under study .",
    "while for pion production near threshold the involved proton momenta are small and a scintillator detector is sufficient , heavier meson production experiments with high proton momenta require magnetic separation @xcite . ] . especially for experiments involving polarized beams and targets , the azimuthal angular distribution of the ejectiles depends on the spin orientation of beam and target polarization .",
    "thus , measurements of polarization observables in meson production reactions require a cylindrically symmetrical detector which is able to measure the momenta and the directions of outgoing charged hadrons .",
    "it should be pointed out that for this task a toroidal field configuration is advantageous , compared to e.g. a solenoid , because residual field components along the beam axis are absent .",
    "thus the polarized gas target can be operated in a weak magnetic guide field .",
    "for the same reason distortions of the beam closed orbit due to the magnetic field of the toroid are avoided to a large extent .",
    "the iucf pion production experiments have shown that in particular large values of the kinematical @xmath16 parameter is defined as the maximum meson momentum divided by the meson mass , @xmath17 characterizes threshold . ]",
    "are of interest .",
    "for instance in @xmath18 , only for values of @xmath19 higher partial waves begin to play a role .",
    "large values of @xmath20 correspond typically to proton scattering angles @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , if for the production of heavy mesons , @xmath16 is the relevant parameter , in order to study the onset of higher partial waves , the new apparatus should be capable to accept a large range of scattering angles of the outgoing hadrons up to about @xmath22 . based on the boundary conditions outlined above , an axially symmetric toroidal magnetic spectrometer seems appropriate .",
    "the first concept of such a device is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : toroid ] .",
    "the recently approved upgrade of the beam injection system , once installed , will supply cosy with high polarized proton and deuteron beam intensities up to the acceptance limit of the machine .",
    "an intense polarized light  ion beam stored in cosy , bombarding a purely polarized internal gas target , surrounded by a toroidal magnetic spectrometer , capable to detect charged hadrons of high momentum , will allow us to fully exploit the machines scientific potential .",
    "such a device would be ideally suited as one of the _ next generation _",
