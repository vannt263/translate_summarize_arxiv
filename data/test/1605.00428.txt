    "cylindrical floating bodies are ubiquitous in ocean engineering . in part , this is due to the fact that the most accessible cases in the linear theory of wave - structure interaction conform to the geometries for which the field equation ",
    "laplace s equation  is separable . in three spatial dimensions ,",
    "the most straightforward such geometry is the circular cylinder . due to the accessibility , and wealth of prior studies",
    "( a brief review of which is given later in the introduction ) , the heaving truncated cylinder is an exceedingly popular model for a wave energy converter ( wec ) , able to absorb energy from waves independent of direction . due to this very ubiquity ,",
    "we feel the design parameters  in this case limited to cylinder size and damping  deserve a separate , careful investigation .",
    "furthermore , we aim to extend prior work by considering all three modes of motion available to an axisymmetric body .",
    "the intention of this study is to present a rather comprehensive account of the hydrodynamics of a wec based on relative motion of two cylindrical bodies , which are allowed to move in heave , as well as sway and roll .",
    "this entails an investigation of different wec sizes and damping coefficients and their performance in wind - generated sea surface waves given by a pierson - moskowitz ( pm ) spectrum .",
    "the spectral description of the sea surface allows one to derive values for the _ significant displacements _ of the wec , and thus add a measure of survivability to the design considerations . finally , an illustrative grading system can be devised to categorize the various performance metrics of the self - reacting wecs .    following the work of falco @xcite we classify wecs into three different types based on different working principles : oscillating water columns , overtopping devices , and oscillating body devices . for the most part ,",
    "offshore devices fall into the last category . furthermore , since energy production by oscillating bodies is governed by the wave - induced motion , the dimensions of such wecs are constrained significantly by the incident wavelengths , and will likely be roughly similar under given conditions . subsequently ,",
    "oscillating body devices may be further subdivided into those reacting against a fixed frame of reference ( either the sea bed or a bottom fixed structure ) , and those reacting against one or more floating bodies , called _ wave - activated bodies _ or _ self - reacting devices . _",
    "these last devices may be installed in deep water , where the large distance between the sea - bed and the surface might otherwise be prohibitive .",
    "the mooring system for such devices has the sole role of counteracting drift and current forces , allowing the weight of moorings and anchors to be relatively small ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we consider vertically floating cylinders , for which a rich literature exists .",
    "the radiation problem in heave only was addressed by ursell in 1949 @xcite , and the scattering problem by dean and ursell @xcite .",
    "miles and gilbert @xcite later employed a variational approximation to provide the far field potential for scattering by a circular dock , along with the lateral forces on the dock . however , their results were subsequently found to contain several inaccuracies , in particular in their calculations of the radiation forces .",
    "this prompted garrett@xcite to take up the problem afresh , and establish the scattering forces for a circular dock .",
    "subsequently , black et al.@xcite revisited the application of variational methods to the radiation and scattering problem by several cylindrical geometries , employing haskind s theorem to give the wave forces .",
    "this latter , variational approach did not yield the added mass and damping coefficients . hence in 1981 , yeung@xcite studied the radiation problem of a vertical cylinder floating on the water surface and undergoing the combined motions of heave , sway and roll , and obtained these hydrodynamic coefficients .",
    "more recently , bhatta@xcite also gave the added mass and damping coefficient of a vertical cylinder undergoing heave motion , in terms of the two dimensionless ratios characterizing the problem ( depth to radius and draft to radius ) . while prior work had focused on the finite depth case , in 2013 , finnegan et al @xcite treated by means of an analytical approximation due to leppington the forces on a truncated vertical cylinder in water of infinite depth .    in the context of wave energy ,",
    "the consideration of floating cylinders as models of wecs goes back at least to berggren & johansson @xcite , who approximated a device described by hagerman by two floating , axisymmetric cylinders oscillating in heave , albeit without any considerations of captured power .",
    "more recently , garnaud and mei @xcite revisited the single buoy with the intention of studying it in densely packed arrays , giving the captured power for buoys hanging from a large frame .",
    "this floating point absorber was also employed , e.g.  by child and venugopal @xcite in their discussion of optimization of wec arrays , or by borgarino et al @xcite as a generic model to investigate wave interaction effects .",
    "similarly , teillant et al @xcite employ an axisymmetric , heaving 2-body device for their study of wec economics , without detailed hydrodynamic considerations .",
    "meanwhile , a slightly different construction of the floating body was considered by engstrm et al @xcite , who added a sphere under the floating cylinder .",
    "this two - body configuration of floating cylinder and submerged sphere was then assumed connected to the sea bed by a generator , and its performance analyzed .",
    "zheng et al @xcite , in a generalization of berggren & johansson to three modes of motion , considered the hydrodynamics of two unconnected , coaxial floating cylinders , again without considering power capture .",
    "the power capture for a heave - only two - cylinder wec was recently obtained for attacking monochromatic incident waves by wu et al @xcite , albeit with a rather terse discussion of their results .",
    "we combine features of several previous authors , and consider the novel case of two floating cylinders with an idealized power take  off ( pto ) , represented by a linear damper of constant characteristics , whose optimization is part of the design procedure .. we undertake our parametric study with an eye towards applications , and thus consider irregular waves in the form of a pm spectrum ( see e.g.  recent work on optimizing a floating box - barge under irregular waves by  bdai & srinil @xcite ) while scatter diagrams may be available for some sites where an assessment of the wave resource has been carried out , where this is not the case estimates based on wind speed will need to be made . to this end , we present our data nondimensionalized on the basis of wind speed , which uniquely determines the pm spectrum . values of significant wave height and peak period may be readily derived therefrom , and the data recast in these terms if desired .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : physical preliminaries ] we present the physical set - up of the problem .",
    "this consists in presenting the twin cylinder wec and characterizing its geometry , and subsequently presenting the pm spectra for design and survivability considerations . in section",
    "[ sec : governing equations ] we present , very briefly , the basic mathematical formulation of the governing equations and sketch the solution procedure .",
    "subsequently , we employ the hydrodynamic coefficients and forces found from solving the equations of section [ sec : governing equations ] to characterizing wec design under monochromatic waves in section [ sec : design of the wec ] , and under irregular waves given by a pierson - moskowitz spectrum in section [ section : irregular design ] .",
    "a discussion of these results with a view to applications is given in section [ section : discussion ] , which is subdivided into section [ subsec : power capture ] on power capture , section [ subsec : survivability ] on survivability , and section [ subsec : grading ] which presents a synthesis of the preceding sections .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] presents some concluding remarks and perspectives .",
    "the geometry and basic parameters of the twin - cylinder wec are depicted in fig [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the @xmath0 plane is the still water surface and the @xmath1-axis points upwards .",
    "( @xmath2 ) are polar coordinates in the horizontal plane , such that @xmath3 and @xmath4 the upper cylinder floats on the water surface with a draft @xmath5 . to provide for flotational stability , it is important to note that the mass of this cylinder is not uniformly distributed , but is divided into two parts with drafts @xmath6 and @xmath7 and densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the lower cylinder is entirely submerged with a draft @xmath10 , and like the upper cylinder is assumed divided into two parts with densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 and drafts @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the distance between the two cylinders is @xmath15 .",
    "both of them have the same radius @xmath16 , and the water depth @xmath17 is taken to be very large compared to the attacking wave length , with the intention of approximating deep - water conditions .    as shown in fig.[fig : geometry ] , the two cylinders are connected by a continuously distributed dashpot , which connects the upper edge of the lower cylinder with the lower edge of the upper cylinder at @xmath18 .",
    "the integrated dashpot coefficient is @xmath19 , which results in a dashpot coefficient per length @xmath20 .",
    "the dashpot is considered to represent a pto , which generates energy from both the relative heave and roll motion of the cylinders .",
    "twincylinders_new(0.2 )    since the two cylinders are axisymmetric , only these three modes are studied .",
    "the heave and sway motions will give rise to relative motions in @xmath1 and @xmath21 directions , respectively .",
    "for waves propagating in the @xmath22direction , the two cylinders roll around the @xmath23-axis in the mean free surface ( @xmath24 ) , yielding a relative angle about this axis .",
    "this formulation of the problem leaves us with thirteen parameters ( @xmath25 ) characterizing the wec . before proceeding",
    ", we will make several restrictions to ensure that the problem remains manageable ; nevertheless , we shall see that a wealth of interesting phenomena and properties of the wec are still accounted for .    for simplicity",
    ", we will take the drafts and distance between the cylinders identical to their radius , and denote the single size parameter by @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 for the density distribution of the cylinders , we shall assume @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density of the water .",
    "thus , the design problem is reduced to two parameters , a size @xmath26 and dashpot coefficient @xmath19 , whose interplay with incoming waves of certain frequencies is the issue at hand .",
    "we shall see that suspending the lower cylinder at a depth @xmath30 below the still water surface has the desired effect of rendering its motion rather small , and thus creating a relatively stable point for the upper cylinder to react against .",
    "there are several reasonable criteria which may govern the design of a wec",
    ". evidently , the wec should capture as much of the incoming wave energy as possible . at the same time , as economic viability is the prime driver behind wave energy technology , the costs  which may be assumed to scale with device size ",
    "should be kept low ; in practical terms , this means that device size should be kept small .",
    "competing with this are concerns over the survivability of the converter , which dictate that displacements of the wec not be too large under severe conditions , favoring larger devices .",
    "we shall return to these issues in detail in later sections .",
    "one of the most common descriptions of a sea - state for engineering purposes is the unidirectional pierson moskowitz ( pm ) spectrum , here given as a function of wavenumber @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean wind speed at a height of @xmath34 m above the mean surface level , and @xmath35 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "this empirically derived formula gives the energy distribution for wind waves in deep water , and differs from the jonswap spectrum only by the addition of a spectral  peak enhancement factor .",
    "this spectrum ( [ pm2 ] ) readily yields a number of important values associated with the sea - state : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the significant wave height and @xmath38 is the wave number of the spectral peak for a given wind speed @xmath33 .",
    "this makes it easy to present subsequent results in an alternative form when desired . a monochromatic wave with wavenumber @xmath38 and the same wave energy density as the pm spectrum will have an amplitude @xmath39    for subsequent illustration it will be necessary to have some concrete , physical examples , which means specifying a sea - state via a wind speed value @xmath40 our design conditions ( denoted by a subscript @xmath41 ) will correspond to a wind speed @xmath42 m / s , while we will consider two  severe states \" ( denoted by subscripts @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) with regard to the survivability , corresponding to wind speeds @xmath45 m / s and @xmath46 m / s .",

    "our approach to solving the wave - structure problem for the twin - cylinder wec relies on domain decomposition and eigenfunction expansion methods ( in the context of floating cylinders , see black & mei @xcite , who give a comprehensive description of the method , or more generally , linton & mciver @xcite , or zheng et al @xcite for a recent application to floating cylinders ) . as the full formulation is rather lengthy ,",

    ", we continue with a decomposition of the problem into two parts : one due to the waves ( @xmath66 ) scattered from the structure ( which is assumed fixed ) by the incident wave field , and one due to the waves ( @xmath67 ) radiated by the motion of the structure , such that @xmath68 @xmath66 is decomposed further into the potential due to the incident wave @xmath69 and that due to the waves diffracted from the fixed structure @xmath70 where @xmath71 the remaining radiated part of the potential @xmath67 must then satisfy , where the normal velocities are to be determined from the equations of motion .",

    "subsequently the scattering problem is divided into three problems , one in each subdomain , and the radiation problem for each of the three modes of each of the two cylinders is divided into three problems .",
    "the reader may appreciate the effort involved in keeping track of , solving , and subsequently matching solutions , of 21 problems for the potentials involved .",
    "these potentials are then applied in calculating the forces on the two cylinders , in the form of pressures from the surrounding fluid .",
    "the full expressions for the exciting , hydrodynamic , and hydrostatic forces are lengthy and will not be given .",
    "we note only that we have found excellent agreement between our results and published work @xcite .",
    "the forces due to the fluid , as well as the forces due to the dampers are employed with newton s second law to yield the body motions .",
    "the first two - equate the vertical ( heave ) forces with the masses and accelerations of the upper and lower cylinder , respectively .",
    "the next - are those for the horizontal ( sway ) forces .",
    "the final pair - equate the torques about the @xmath82axis to the angular acceleration times moment of inertia of the upper and lower cylinder , respectively .",

    "we now undertake to examine the design of the wec , based on the three parameters characterizing the environmental conditions @xmath105 and @xmath106 the two wec parameters @xmath26 and @xmath107 and the seven wec performance parameters calculated from the wave - structure interaction problem @xmath108 and @xmath109 an application of buckingham s @xmath110 theorem @xcite yields that there will be nine dimensionless quantities that characterize this problem : @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 in the sequel , we will make use of a @xmath117 to denote nondimensional variables , i.e. , the nine dimensionless quantitites above will be @xmath118 and @xmath119      for simplicity of presentation and ease of understanding we initially consider only the heave mode , motivated by the fact that , while sway and roll are generally coupled , they are both independent of heave .",
    "the response of the wec under incoming monochromatic waves is first considered , where our physical test - case corresponds to a monochromatic wave of wavelength @xmath120 m equal to that at the peak of the design spectrum @xmath121 and an amplitude @xmath122 such that the total energy density of the wave is equal to that of @xmath121 see and table [ swss ] .",
    "we first choose the dashpot coefficient @xmath19 to be zero , which means that the two cylinders are freely floating .",
    "in this case , once the incident monochromatic wave is given , the only wec parameter to be determined is @xmath26 .",
    "dimensional analysis can then be applied to the problem of determining the quantity of interest @xmath26 for the motions of the upper cylinder @xmath123 and the lower cylinder @xmath124 separately .",
    "once again , buckingham s @xmath110 theorem yields that , for the variables @xmath125 and @xmath126 there exist exactly two nondimensional quantities , which must be related by a relation @xmath127 the maximum displacement of the cylinder @xmath128 as a function of size @xmath129 thus corresponds to the extrema of @xmath130 equation is plotted in figure [ fig : free - heave - z ] for the upper and lower cylinders .    ) under the design monochromatic wave .",

    "as we are ultimately interested in relative displacements of the cylinders , the global maximum of @xmath133 and the local maximum of @xmath134 which occur at @xmath135 yield the chosen design size .",
    "the maximum displacement in fig .  [ fig : free - heave - z ] is related to the resonance between the cylinders and the incident monochromatic wave .",
    "the introduction of a damper , while changing the magnitude of the displacement , can be shown to have no effect on the location of the resonant maximum , which remains @xmath135 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : free - heave - z ] ) even for various values of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the size of the wec determined from the freely floating case is used to specify the dashpot coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "given the unique relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath126 independent of @xmath107 described above , the dimensional analysis of the power absorption involves the quantities @xmath136 and @xmath137 which can be written in three dimensionless ratios : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pald - heave ] for the wec size as determined in the last section ( @xmath135 ) .     and the dashpot coefficient @xmath140 for the heave motion induced by the design monochromatic wave , where @xmath135 . ]",
    "we elect to determine the dashpot coefficient @xmath19 from the maximum of captured power @xmath141 in figure [ fig : pald - heave ] , calculated from the heave terms only in ( [ pa ] ) .",
    "this results in @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "thus , the wec design for a monochromatic wave has been determined . taking the design wave introduced in the beginning of section [ sec : design of the wec ] as a physical example , the wec has the dimensions @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and can capture @xmath146 from a monochromatic wave 96.3 m long and 0.87 m in amplitude .",
    "having treated the simpler case of heave - only motion , we now consider the general case in which the wec is additionally allowed to undergo sway and roll motions .",
    "akin to the previous section which only dealt with the heave motion , the design procedure of the wec in the general case is also divided into two steps , as illustrated in detail below .",
    "we start with the freely floating case , where the dashpot coefficient @xmath147 . using the equations of motion ( [ eq : mo1])-([eq : mo6 ] ) , we can obtain the displacements of the two cylinders in the @xmath21 and @xmath1 directions , and the angle around the @xmath23 axis .",
    "once the monochromatic wave is given , or equivalently , once the mean wind speed for the corresponding pm spectrum is given , the physical process of determining the size of the wec can be written in the following dimensionless form : @xmath148 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the amplitudes of the vertical and horizontal displacements respectively , @xmath78 is the amplitude of the angle around the @xmath23 axis , and @xmath149 corresponds to the upper and lower cylinder , respectively .",
    "we now seek the maxima of the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 presented in fig.[freefloat-3 m ] .",
    "due to the increase in number of modes , the picture of the displacements is more complex than in the preceding section .",

    ", we now suppose that the size of the wec is given .",
    "the captured power @xmath141 then depends on the dashpot coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "the determination of optimal power absorption as a function of dashpot coefficient is described in dimensionless form by @xmath154 where , as we have seen , there is some flexibility in choice of @xmath155 the function @xmath156 is plotted in fig .",

    "leads to a two - fold branching in the design procedure .",
    "firstly , in free motion , one value of @xmath129 is found to yield the largest roll and sway displacements , while another value yields the largest heave displacements . while the heave - optimized case has a unique maximum @xmath167 as a function of damping , the roll / sway - optimized case admits two local maxima of @xmath168 one with relatively low , the other with relatively high damping @xmath169 compared to the heave case ( see figure [ fig : pald-3 m ] ) .",
    "this opens up the possibility that the overall optimal design may not coincide with a design optimized for roll / sway or heave alone , but occupying some middle ground .",

    "recall that these nondimensional quantities depend only on the relations @xmath178 and @xmath179 as specified in section [ sec : physical preliminaries ] , and the concomitant changes in significant wave - height and peak wavenumber .",
    "for illustrative purposes , if the design spectrum @xmath47 is generated by a fresh breeze ( @xmath180 or 5 beafort , 2.47 m @xmath181 ) , then the first severe state @xmath48 may be thought generated by a high wind ( 7 beaufort , 5.5 m @xmath181 ) .",
    "the second severe state @xmath49 occurs under conditions between gale and severe gale ( 89 beaufort , 9.9 m @xmath181 ) .",
    "these extremely harsh conditions represent an energy density more than 16 times that of the design spectrum , and may be expected to challenge the device design .",
    "while the increase in significant wave - height between the design spectrum @xmath47 and the severe case @xmath49 may seem dramatic , there is no doubt that such conditions will be encountered within the operational life of a wec . for example , while deep water conditions for the eastern mediterranean off israel s coasts may see significant wave heights greater than 2 m only 6 % of the time , and wave heights in summer rarely exceed 11.5 m , nevertheless storms with @xmath181 in excess of 5 m occur almost yearly .",
    "the 10-year return period significant wave height is nearly 7 m , which clearly falls within the expected operational life of a converter .    from a pure survivability standpoint ,",
    "it is immediate only that the smallest converter a1 is not viable . in particular ,",
    "the very small damping of this configuration ( see table [ table : dimensional power capture ] ) , while allowing for efficient power capture from the roll mode , also leads to overly large displacements even for design conditions . with survivability as the central aim of design",
    ", larger structures will necessarily fare better , though the differences between devices d , e , and f are in practice rather small . while other authors ( e.g.  maisondieu @xcite or brown et al @xcite ) have investigated survivability of wecs , they have been forced to do so without reference to the hydrodynamics and actual displacements of a floating device , but rather purely based on estimations of the incident wave power .",
    "we shall now make a preliminary attempt to sum up the results of the preceding sections .",
    "the intricacies of wec economics , as well as the many factors which are outside the scope of the present study , such as moorings , specifics of the pto , control strategies , power conversion and transmission , and other environmental factors from seasonal variability to extreme events , will need to be taken into account for a fuller analysis .",
    "in addition , wec cost will not be considered , and is likely to impact significantly the ultimate design .",

    "once again , we point out that the monochromatic case is essentially artificial , and included only for illustrative purposes .",
    "the lessons to be drawn from this comparison will likely change as wave - power technology matures . while current oscillating - body devices may be rather small , and situated in shallow water with the intention of keeping costs down , future developments will naturally lead to a move into the more powerful wave - regimes further offshore ( see stiassnie et al @xcite for a discussion ) .    as an example , while there is a 15 % reduction in absorbed power between case e and case h under the design spectrum , the corresponding increase in absorbed power for severe case @xmath49 is upwards of 60 % .",
    "the fact that , off the eastern mediterranean coast , some 45 % of average wave power comes during storm events that occur only 5 % of the time indicates the utility of the larger design @xcite .",
    "this is compounded by the increase in potential survivability of the larger devices as indicated in the previous section .",
    "depending on the variability of the wave - energy resource , more or less weight may ultimately be given to each of the considerations just outlined .",
    "the fact that the larger devices exhibit smaller relative motions may also be a benefit for their reliability , in terms of limiting loading during normal operation .",
    "ultimately , an effort will have to be made to weigh the additional cost of a larger device against the increase in survivability .",
    "both of these in turn will need to be weighed against the potential of continuing operation during high - energy events , while sustaining a slight performance decrease for low - energy sea states .",
    "we have investigated in detail the hydrodynamics of a model wec consisting of two floating , axisymmetric cylinders connected at their upper and lower perimeters by a continuously distributed damper  allowing power capture from heave and roll modes . while other authors have studied various aspects of the problem of floating cylinders , the present work has addresses for the first time the problem of a twin cylinder wec allowed to move in three degrees of freedom .",
    "the inclusion of a floating , submerged cylinder as a mechanical reference for power extraction makes this design viable in deep water . with further development of the wave energy industry",
    ", it may be anticipated that wecs will follow wind turbines in moving further offshore , making such self - reacting devices more and more relevant @xcite .",
    "our design procedure initially focused on optimizing device behavior for a damper of constant characteristic in monochromatic waves .",
    "at the outset , the heave - only case was considered , presenting a simple situation where a single device ( characterized by a size parameter @xmath26 and a damping parameter @xmath19 ) , coinciding with the resonant maximum of a freely floating body , outperformed all others . allowing the device also to sway and roll",
    "was seen to introduce additional complexity , and a differentiation was observed between devices operating preferentially in roll / sway and those operating preferentially in heave .    despite the multiplicity of possible designs when the device is allowed to undergo heave , sway , and roll motions",
    ", the monochromatic case presents a clear picture from the standpoint of power absorption : the device closest to heave resonance is found to perform best .",
    "this conclusion is an artifact of the idealization represented by the monochromatic theory  a fact established by the subsequent investigation of wec performance under an irregular sea .    for our design purposes , a pierson - moskowitz spectrum , characterized by wind speed , was chosen to evaluate the designs obtained from the monochromatic case . under this spectrum ,",
    "the maxima of absorbed power were found to shift markedly with respect to the monochromatic case , reflecting the potential for detuning to increase captured power in wec design .",
    "larger values of absorbed power under the design spectrum were found for devices slightly larger and slightly smaller than the monochromatic optimum , raising the question of how to determine device sizing in light of other criteria .    to this end , we have devised some example metrics for grading the sizes of our twin - cylinder wec .",
    "we note that wave energy presents particular difficulties in many respects .",
    "while a fixed offshore structure may be designed for survival with very high safety factors , this is inappropriate for oscillating body wecs ; by their nature , they must undergo the largest possible motions in order to extract energy . at the same time",
    ", device loading should be minimized to avoid fatigue and failure .",
    "taking into account the fact that wecs may be expected to be operational for on the order of 25 years ( see starling @xcite ) , and it becomes clear that survival is a paramount issue .",
    "we have presented an example approach to quantitatively evaluate the competing aims of survivability and power extraction within the framework of our floating twin - cylinder device .    to a certain extent",
    "all renewable energy technologies , wecs more than most , can not control their operating conditions , but must work within their environment , subject to the resulting fluctuations of the resource . it must be expected that , like wind turbines , oscillating body wecs will be designed with a  survival mode \" , when normal operation cease , and the device changes its characteristics in order to avoid extreme loads .",
    "( we might note that overtopping wecs or owcs ( see section [ sec : introduction ] ) , due to a different working principle and resulting size , will likely have a very different survivability analysis than oscillating body designs . )",
    "this may mean increasing the damping , altering the water plane area or mass ( see stallard et al @xcite ) , or other approaches ( see coe and neary @xcite ) .",
    "due to the nascent state of commercial wave - energy technology , it is difficult to offer concrete design recommendations based on the results for floating twin - cylinders .",
    "our discussion does bear out the fact that a slight over - engineering may be preferable , given the large relative contribution of infrequent , high - energy events to the annual energy budget at many sites , and the demands of survival and robustness .",
    "we believe these results to be applicable more broadly to oscillating - body converters , constrained in size as they are by the incident wavelength , indicated by the striking similarities in performance between our twin - cylinder configuration and a single bottom - referenced cylinder .",
    "while many topics of critical importance have not been touched upon  from moorings to electricity transmission to specifics of power take - off ",
    "we hope to have presented a rather comprehensive picture of the design of a floating twin - cylinder wec in deep water .",
    "there is considerable room for future work , e.g taking into account seasonal resource variability , extreme wave statistics , pto control , and device cost , as well as detailed studies of reliability under regular operation , where it is hoped that some of the gaps left by this work will be filled in .",
