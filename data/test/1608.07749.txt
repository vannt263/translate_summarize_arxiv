    "finding the full automorphism group is one of the fundamental objectives when dealing with symmetry properties of mathematical objects , such as for example vertex - transitive graphs , see @xcite .",
    "many of these objects naturally display certain inherently obvious symmetries .",
    "it is often the case , however , that certain additional symmetries , though hidden or difficult to grasp , are present . the goal is to find a reason for their existence and a method for describing them . along these lines",
    "the above question reads as follows : _ given a ( transitive ) group @xmath0 acting on the set of vertices of a graph , determine whether @xmath0 is its full automorphism group or not .",
    "when the answer is no , find a method to describe the additional automorphisms .",
    "_ in other words , decide whether the group @xmath0 imbeds into a larger group @xmath1 preserving the structure of the graph in question .    in this paper such group",
    "`` extensions '' are considered by studying the existence of automorphisms that act as odd permutations on the vertex set of a graph .",
    "such an automorphism will be referred to as _",
    "odd automorphism_. analogously , an automorphism acting as an even permutation on the vertex set will be referred to as an _ even automorphism_.    the implications are more far - reaching than one would expect from the simplicity of the concept of even and odd automorphisms alone .",
    "some arguments supporting this claim are given in the paragraphs following formulation of problems  [ problem - graph ] and  [ problem - group ] .",
    "for example , when @xmath0 consists of even automorphisms only , a partial answer to the above question could be given provided the structure of the graph in question forces existence of odd automorphisms .",
    "we propose the following problem .",
    "[ problem - graph ] which vertex - transitive graphs admit odd automorphisms ?",
    "it is convenient to consider problem  [ problem - graph ] in the framework of orbital ( di)graphs of transitive groups .",
    "namely , isomorphism classes of vertex - transitive ( di)graphs are in a one - to - one correspondence with orbital ( di)graphs of transitive group actions , as seen below .",
    "a transitive group @xmath0 acting on a set @xmath2 induces an action of @xmath0 on @xmath3 - the corresponding orbits are called _ orbitals _ of @xmath0 on @xmath2 . given a union @xmath4 of orbitals not containing the diagonal orbital @xmath5 , the _ orbital ( di)graph _ @xmath6 of @xmath0 on @xmath2 with respect to @xmath4",
    "has vertex set @xmath2 and edge set @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath4 consists of a single orbital the orbital ( di)graph @xmath6 is said to be _",
    "the problem below is a somewhat restricted reformulation of problem  [ problem - graph ] .",
    "[ problem - group ] given a transitive group @xmath0 , possibly consisting of even permutations only , is there a basic orbital ( di)graph of @xmath0 admitting an odd automorphism ?",
    "transitive groups for which the answer to problem  [ problem - group ] is positive are referred to as _ orbital - odd_. not all transitive groups consisting solely of even permutations admit orbital - odd imbeddings . for example",
    ", the group @xmath8 acting transitively on the set of cosets of @xmath9 consists of even permutations only , and is isomorphic to the full automorphism group of every basic orbital ( di)graph associated with this action .",
    "hence , @xmath10 is not orbital - odd . on the other hand , the alternating group @xmath11 acting transitively on the set of cosets of @xmath12 ( which also consists of even permutations only )",
    "is orbital - odd .",
    "namely , the full automorphism group of its two basic orbital graphs - the petersen graph and its complement - contains odd automorphisms ( and is isomorphic to the symmetric group @xmath13 ) . more generally , as observed in @xcite , every vertex - transitive graph of order twice a prime admits an odd automorphism , and hence every transitive group of degree twice a prime is orbital - odd .",
    "an essential ingredient in the proof of this result is the fact that the above actions of @xmath11 and @xmath13 are the only simply primitive groups of degree twice a prime  a direct consequence of the classification of finite simple groups ( cfsg )",
    ". it would be of interest to obtain a cfsg - free proof of the fact that every vertex - transitive graph of order twice a prime admits an odd automorphism . combining this together with a classical wielandt s result on simply primitive groups of degree twice a prime being of rank @xmath14 ( see @xcite )  currently the best available cfsg - free information on such groups",
    " one would move a step closer to obtaining a cfsg - free proof of non - existence of simply primitive groups of degree @xmath15 , @xmath16 a prime ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "observe that , if a graph has an odd automorphism then it must have an odd automorphism whose order is a power of @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , an odd automorphism exists if and only if there is one in a sylow @xmath17-subgroup of the automorphism group , as observed in @xcite .",
    "consequently , for some classes of graphs the existence of odd automorphisms is easy to determine .",
    "for instance , in cayley graphs the corresponding regular group contains odd permutations if and only if its sylow @xmath17-subgroup is cyclic . when a sylow @xmath17-subgroup is not cyclic , the search for odd automorphisms has to be done outside the regular group , raising the complexity of the problem .",
    "studying `` extensions '' via odd automorphisms is also essential in obtaining new approaches for solving certain long - standing open problems in algebraic graph theory .",
    "for example , in the semiregularity problem @xcite , which asks for the existence of semiregular automorphisms in vertex - transitive ( di)graph , knowing that the graph admits odd automorphisms would be helpful in the case when the underlying transitive group @xmath0 consisting of even automorphisms is elusive ( that is , without semiregular elements ) .",
    "one could therefore hope for the existence of semiregular automorphisms in the odd part of the `` extension '' .",
    "for example , the group @xmath18 acting on the set of @xmath19 lines of the affine plane @xmath20 is elusive and consists of even permutations only .",
    "its @xmath17-closure , however , contains semiregular as well as odd permutations , in fact it contains an odd semiregular permutation of order @xmath21 .",
    "further , in the hamiltonicity problem @xcite as well as in the snark problem for cubic cayley graphs @xcite , important progress was recently obtained by combining algebraic methods with the theory of regular maps on surfaces @xcite . knowing the graphs admit odd automorphisms will most likely be helpful in our quest to solve the remaining open cases .",
    "our ultimate goal is to build a theory that will allow us to decide whether a given graph , admitting a transitive group action , does or does not have odd automorphisms . in this respect",
    "the first step in our strategy consists in finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of odd automorphisms for as large as possible class of graphs , admitting a transitive action of a group , with certain suitably imposed constraints .",
    "it is natural to expect that the solution to the question of existence of odd automorphisms will have some degree of arithmetic flavor .",
    "as may be suggested by the results of this paper this is true , but only up to a certain extent .",
    "in approaching problems  [ problem - graph ] and  [ problem - group ] in a systematic manner it seems natural to start with the analysis of vertex - transitive graphs of smallest possible ( non - trivial ) valency @xmath14 .",
    "such graphs fall into three classes : graphical regular representations of groups , vertex - transitive graphs with two edge orbits , and symmetric graphs .",
    "as already mentioned , graphs in the class of ( cubic ) graphical regular representations of groups admit odd automorphisms if and only if sylow @xmath17-subgroups of their automorphism groups are cyclic .",
    "cubic vertex - transitive graphs with two edge orbits ( together with the corresponding tetravalent locally imprimitive symmetric graphs ) will be considered in a separate paper .    in this paper",
    "we give a complete solution to problem  [ problem - graph ] for cubic symmetric graphs .",
    "( as a consequence a partial solution to problem  [ problem - group ] is obtained . ) this class of graphs was first studied by foster @xcite and has been the source of motivation for various research directions in algebraic graph theory . in foster census",
    "@xcite , a list of such graphs of order up to @xmath22 was produced . with the availability of advanced computational tools @xcite the list",
    "was recently expanded to graphs of order up to @xmath23 , see @xcite .",
    "many well - known graphs are cubic symmetric graphs , arising in connection with certain open problems in graph theory ( such as the hamiltonicity problem @xcite ) , and more generally as an important concept in other areas of mathematics ( such as finite geometry @xcite ) . for example , the petersen graph @xmath24 and the coxeter graph @xmath25 are the only known symmetric graphs of order greater than @xmath17 without a hamilton cycle .",
    "next , all bipartite cubic symmetric graphs of girth at least @xmath26 are levi graphs of @xmath27 configurations .",
    "for example , the heawood graph @xmath28 , the moebius - kantor graph @xmath29 , the pappus graph @xmath30 and the desargues graph @xmath31 are levi graphs of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 configurations , respectively .",
    "( hereafter the notation @xmath36 , @xmath37 , etc . will refer to the corresponding graphs in the foster census  @xcite .",
    ") there are @xmath38 possible types of cubic symmetric graphs ( see table  [ tab : cubic - types ] in subsection  [ sec : cubic - sym ] ) , and the existence of odd automorphisms depends on these types and orders of graphs in question .",
    "results of this paper do imply that the solution to problem  [ problem - graph ] is to some degree arithmetic . however , some special cases sprouting out in the solution for cubic symmetric graphs suggest that the even / odd question is likely to uncover certain more complex structural properties of graphs ( and combinatorial objects in general ) , that go beyond simple arithmetic conditions .",
    "the following is the main result of this paper .",
