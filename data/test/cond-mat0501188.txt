    "the most trivial disorder originates in media due to random static impurities ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , another but very interesting possibilities are glasses , which have a huge number of ( meta)stable degenerated states .",
    "originally glassy system has a homogeneous hamiltonian with no intrinsic random parameter , and disorder occurs in it dynamically .",
    "recently @xcite we have demonstrated that a popular frenkel - kontorova model @xcite presents an example of glassy system , which has a lot of static states , known as _ configurational excitations _ of the classical ground state , with energy splitting extremely ( exponentially ) small . as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "this model has a nontrivial quantum dynamics , the quantum phase transition : if quantum parameter exceeds some critical value , the `` pinned '' glassy phase turns into `` sliding '' phonon gas .    the frenkel - kontorova model ( fk ) @xcite is widely used @xcite in the solid state physics to get insight on generic properties of noncommesurate systems .",
    "its ground state , which is rather quasiperiodical @xcite than periodical , attracts also an attention @xcite as some interplay @xcite between order and disorder @xcite .",
    "this model describes a chain of atoms / particles interacting with elastic forces , placed in periodic potential , which period differs from a mean interparticle distance .",
    "the ground state ( gs ) of this model is defined as a static , equilibrium configuration of the chain , that corresponds to the _ absolute _ minimum of the chain potential energy .",
    "the ground state is unique and has some special order of particles in the chain , that was discovered by aubry @xcite more than twenty years ago .",
    "the positions of atoms in the chain are described by an area preserving map , which is well known in the field of dynamical chaos as the chirikov standard map @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the mean interparticle distance to a period of the external potential in the fk model determines the rotation number of the invariant curves of the map , while the amplitude of the periodic potential gives the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 . for @xmath1",
    "the kam curves are smooth and the spectrum of longwave phonon excitations in the chain is characterized by a linear dispersion law starting from zero frequency . in this regime",
    "the chain can freely slide along the external field ( the `` sliding '' phase ) . on the contrary , for @xmath2",
    "the kam curves are destroyed and replaced by an invariant cantor set , which is called cantorus . in this regime",
    "the phonon spectrum has a gap , and the chain is pinned ( `` pinned '' phase ) .",
    "later , on the example of ising spin model to which the fk model can be approximately reduced @xcite it has been shown @xcite that the gs has some well defined hierarchical structure , which particular detailes are determined by number properties of the ratio of the mean interparticle distance to the period of the external field . recently our numerical study @xcite of the original fk model in the pinned phase has shown , that the gs has indeed an hierarchical structure , but in some important detailes different from predicted in @xcite .    in short ,",
    "we put our attention to the striking fact , that in the pinned phase of the fk chain there are some particles , which positions exponentially close to bottoms of wells of the external potential : corresponding external force acting to such particle is extremely close to zero .",
    "obviously , in static equilibrium each of these particles can be considered as some dummy `` glue '' that only couples two adjacent parts of the chain , which ends has almost identical ( exponentially close ) tension forces .",
    "another important observation is that small deviations of glue particles from their well bottoms are _ groupped _ into well defined hierarchically ordered scales .",
    "now , if one cut the chain into fragments via glue particles , which belong to level with least deviation from well bottoms , one gets several fragments of _ two _ sizes , or two species of some `` bricks '' .",
    "the most simple picture quoted here assumes that this rotational number approximates the golden mean value . ] .",
    "then one may repeat the procedure , cutting `` bricks '' via `` glue '' particles that belong to next scale of deviations and getting two new species of smaller bricks , and so far . at the last step one",
    "gets two species of smallest possible bricks with _ no _ glue particle inside : smaller bricks @xmath3 which consist of 2 particles inside a single well , and larger brick @xmath4 which consist of 4 particles ( two pairs in two adjacent wells ) . in this way one gets an hierarchically ordered set of brick species @xmath5 with very simple composition rules @xcite :    @xmath6    where symbol @xmath7 denotes of an insertion of glue particle , which `` glues '' two adjacent bricks",
    "the difference of tension forces at boundaries of bricks @xmath8 and @xmath9 is exponentially small and decrease rapidly with a number of the hierarcy level . in principle , these rules are sufficient to construct a gs for a fk chain of any length , if the rotation number parameter of the chain approximates the mean golden value @xmath10 .",
    "besides the gs there exists `` configurational excitation states '' ( ces ) , presented by static equilibrium configurations corresponding to _ local _ ( rather than absolute ) minima of the chain potential , with energy very close to gs . within the picture just outlined above ces correspond to different permutations of bricks @xcite , therefore the number of them can be combinatorically huge . at any accessible small temperature their contributions can dominate over the contribution of gs .    in this paper",
    "we address to phonon excitations of the chain , small vibrations around static gs and ces configurations of the chain .",
    "these excitations are relevant as for heat transport properties @xcite of the chain , as for some quantum effects @xcite , especially in the quasiclassical limit . as in the previous paper",
    ", we concentarte on the case of pinned phase of the chain , which corresponds to a nonzero phonon gap .",
    "we start with analysis of the structure of the phonon frequency spectrum in the gs .",
    "it is well known , that this spectrum is splitted into bands @xcite but , to our knowledge , up to now there is no clear explanation for origin of its splitting into particular bands and subbands .",
    "we show , that this splitting is a direct consequence of particular spatial structure of the chain in its gs .",
    "we have found , that this structure is also hierarchically ordered , with definite resemblance and distinctions with respect to a spatial structure of underlying gs .",
    "localisation properties of phonons in incommensurate one - dimentional chains are intesively studied in recent works @xcite , with strong indications @xcite , that phonon modes in the gs of fk chain are not localized , and even at edges of frequency bands they are rather _ prelocalized _ , than localized .",
    "we study also phonon properties as in gs , as in ces of the chain .",
    "our results confirm , that in the gs phonon modes are only prelocalized .",
    "however , the situation appears to be quite different for ces . even for ces , which energy splitting ( in natural problem scale ) @xmath11 there are phonon modes , which are localized exponentially .",
    "moreover , for ces with higher splitting @xmath12 we see , that there are entire bands of exponentially localized phonon modes .",
    "the hamiltonian of the fk model is    @xmath13    the first term in the hamiltonian is a kinetic energy , where we put masses of particles @xmath14 , the second term describes interparticle interaction with elasticity coefficient put to unity , while the third term corresponds to particle interaction with external periodical field with coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "all @xmath16 particles are distributed over @xmath17 period / wells of the external potential , which period , without any loss of generality is taken equal to @xmath18 .",
    "the ratio @xmath19 gives @xcite the rotational number of corresponding standard map @xcite .",
    "we assume periodical boundary conditions : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the length of the chain . in our subsequent analysis",
    "we take ( as some _ typical _ example of fk chain ) the chain with @xmath23 as an approximation of the golden mean value @xmath24 , and parameter @xmath25 well above the critical value @xmath26@xcite .",
    "the technique to obtain gs and ces is described in our previous work @xcite .",
    "let us stress , that validity of the gs can be checked either by direct analysis @xcite of its spatial structure , or proved by monotonous behavior @xcite of its hall function .",
    "note , that the gs is almost degenerate with enormous number of ces : there are hundreds of states with @xmath27 , while the number of ecs with @xmath11 exceeds @xmath28 !",
    "effective hamiltonian for phonon modes can be obtained by expansion up to second order terms of the original fk chain hamiltonian ( [ hfk ] ) around a chosen static configuration of the chain : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are small deviations of particles from their equilibrium static positions @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are corresponding particle momenta . the elasticity matrix @xmath33 solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath34 numerically , we get both the spectrum of phonon frequencies and corresponding vectors of phonon modes .",
    "it is well known for a long time @xcite , that frequency spectrum of phonons in the frenkel - kontorova chain is splitted into several bands .",
    "main features of the spectrum for a chain in the gs look as very universal : ( i ) the number of main bands are independent of the parameter @xmath15 as well as of a length of the chain ; ( ii ) it was also noticed in @xcite ( without any explanation , either ) that boundaries of the bands correspond to fibonacci numbers ; ( iii ) replacement in interparticle interactions elastic forces by the lenard - jones potential does not change qualitatively a pattern of splitting phonon spectrum into band @xcite .",
    "now we can explain these and more features as direct consequence of particular spatial structure @xcite of the gs , which main relevant detailes are summarized in introduction . the key point of our explanation is that the gs consists of large number of almost identical elements . for clarity sake",
    ", we consider a particular case of the fk chain with @xmath23 , but all our arguments can be easily generalizied for a chain of different size .",
    "applying the picture of cs spatial structure outlined in introduction to our particular case , we can see , that our cs can be presented as a composition of two bricks of 3d level of hierarcy : @xmath35 with subsequent expansion , in accordance with composition rules ( [ cr1]),([cr2 ] ) , into bricks of 2nd level : @xmath36 which , in turn , are expanded into bricks of 1st level : @xmath37 that , at last , are expanded into basic bricks of zero level : @xmath38 in this way it is easy to calculate , that the chain can be cut into pieces either as @xmath39 or @xmath40 or @xmath41 or @xmath42 , see ( [ xl3 ] )",
    ". mutual static disturbance of bricks is small and decreases exponentially with a level of hierarcy , therefore we have at any level of hierarcy a sequence in some order of two species of almost identical structures ( bricks ) .",
    "now let us make some important remark . in our study in @xcite of _ static _ structure of the chain , the glue particles play a some passive role only , which results in their specification as some dummy `` glue '' .",
    "however , in _ dynamical _ problem of motion particles in the chain , that we now address to , the role of glue particles becomes more important , since they have masses .",
    "actually , in this case one should consider as repeating structures _ elementary cells _",
    ", which we get if attach to each brick ( e. g. at the left side ) one glue particle .",
    "at the basic level of hierarcy one have 55 elementary cells of 3 particles and 89 elementary cells of 5 particles , let them be called as cells @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "each elementary cell , being isolated ( and , e.g. periodically closed ) has its own eigenfrequencies : three for a cell @xmath45 and five for a cell @xmath46 .",
    "then , if these cells in the chain be really isolated , then , see fig.[frgs ] we get three bands each of 55 degenerated states ( solid lines ) which belongs to cells @xmath45 , and five bands each of 89 degenerated states ( dotted lines ) .",
    "due to cells interactions",
    "all degenerated frequencies are really splitted into finite width bands , see fig.[frgs ]",
    ". the closer inspection of frequency spectrum shows , that seven largest breaks cut the exact spectrum in bands @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 so the band widths have the same order 89 , 55 , 89 , 89 , 55 , 89 , 55 , 89 , exactly as the sequence of solid and dotted horizontal lines in fig.[frgs ] !",
    "now , let us remind , that the sequence of cells @xmath45 and @xmath46 in our gs is not random but they belong to 34 cells of the next hierarcy level , see ( [ xs1 ] ) : 13 cells @xmath55 and 21 cells @xmath56 . again , if this cells would be decoupled , we could see bands , that consist of 13 and 21 degenerated states . indeed , in the middle part of the fig.[frgs ] , where the central band is shown with greater resolution , we see a sequence of bands , that contain 21,13 , 21 , ( 21 + 13 ) , 21 , 13 , 21 number of states , which is similar to that we have at the main level of hierarcy",
    "! however , at higher resolution ( the right box in fig.[frgs ] ) the spectrum in central band becomes structureless .",
    "this is not surprising , since the `` cells '' we have introduced are not weakly coupled objects with respect to phonon modes .",
    "in fact , what cells provides , is that some chain fragments have fixed periods ; these fragments form locally their band structure .",
    "if bands of different fragments overlap , their levels are collectivised into one common band .",
    "the central band is the case , however in this case band levels are less sensitive to small variations introduced by extra regularities of next levels of hierarcy of spatial chain structure .",
    "however , a quite new interesting phenomenon occurs , if one consider band , which belongs to a cell @xmath46 but does _ not _ overlap with any band of the cell @xmath45 .",
    "phonons with frequencies inside this band will be damped along the cells of the kind @xmath45 , these cells will play a role of some `` potential barriers '' , which decouple cells of the kind @xmath46 each from other .",
    "our chain contains 89 cells @xmath46 and 55 cells @xmath45 , which is like to 89 particles separated by 55 barriers , or distributed among 55 wells .",
    "now we have got a new effective frenkel - kontorova chain , where cells @xmath46 play role some particles with potential barriers @xmath45 among them . for a clarity sake ,",
    "let us take more graphical notations for these effective `` barrier '' @xmath57 , and `` particle '' @xmath58 . then",
    ", seconary bricks , which occur in this effective fk chain , are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and corresponding elementary cells can be obtained adding to bricks one `` glue '' particle at the left : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , having again three and five eigenfrequencies , respectively .",
    "our effective chain has 8 cells @xmath63 and 13 cells @xmath64 .",
    "now , if in the frequency spectrum of new _ effective _ fk chain we take a band , which belongs to the cell @xmath64 but not to the cell @xmath63 , it must contain 13 states .",
    "we can repeat the whole procedure ones more ; then we come to next level effective frenkel - kontorova chain with 13 effective particles @xmath64 distributed among 8 potential barriers @xmath63 , and to next generation cells , one of the kind @xmath65 and two of the kind @xmath66 .",
    "numerical data presented in fig.[frgs4 ] confirm our picture in all the detailes .",
    "here we consider the fourth band of spectra , which is well resolved from other bands , see , the left box of fig.[frgs4 ] .",
    "it contains 89 states , the number of cells @xmath46 . in the middle box",
    "we take again the fourth band which in turn contains 13 states , the number of cells @xmath64 . at",
    "last , in the right box we show by open circles 3 states of the cell @xmath65 and by closed ones @xmath67 states of two cells @xmath66 .",
    "note , that this new kind of hierarcy is quite different from that we found in @xcite with respect to spatial structure , since the transformation rules between levels of hierarcy are more complicated .",
    "in conclusion of this section it should be stressed , that all the universal features of the global band structure mentioned at the beginning are goverened by nearest order in the chain . in contrast , the fine structure depends crucially on the far order .. the latter is destroyed in the ces , therefore in ces the fine structure is washed out , and frequency spectra become smoother , see fig.[frgs_ex ] . in particular , we see also in fig.[frgs_ex ] how two lowest bands are merged into common one .",
    "the ordering of bricks , which persists in the gs , is gradually destroyed with configurational excitation of the chain .",
    "the lowest excitations are equivalent destruction of largest bricks due to permutations of bricks of preceeding level of hierarcy : the smaller bricks are destroyed , the higher is the excitation energy @xcite .",
    "the number of almost degenerate ces , originating from different bricks permutation is combunatorically large , therefore some arbitrary chosen ces has rather _ random _ sequence of bricks , and is similar to disordered media , e.g. spin glass system .    from the very beginning it is clear , that perfect randomization of bricks order may result in anderson localization of phonon modes .",
    "a new interesting point is , that fk model does _ not _ require any external disorder : randomization of bricks order in fk chain occurs dynamically",
    ". another interesting feature , which characterizes a degree of chaotization of bricks in ces , is that all the examples of exponential localization are obtained from _",
    "single _ arbitrary taken ces , without averaging over any encemble of nearest ces .",
    "a typical quantity used traditionally in studies of localization phenomena ( see , in particular @xcite ) is the participation ratio ( pr ) , defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a normalized ( @xmath70 ) vector of the phonon eigenstate .",
    "its value correspond to a chain fraction occupied by the localized state , but whether the state is localized exponentially can be unclear",
    ". typical feature of exponentially localized state is that components outside the center of localization are exponentially small .",
    "meanwhile , this components do not contribute in pr at all .    to our opinion a better characteristics to indicate an _ exponential _ localization can be the generalized mean geometrical value ( mgv ) , defined as@xmath71 where , a normalization factor @xmath16 provides that for extended states @xmath72 be order of unity .",
    "the reason in favor to @xmath72 is that it essentially better probes the exponentially small components ( tails ) of the phonon eigenstate . in particular , for a typical exponentially localized state @xmath73 , @xmath74 is a localization length , and value of the mgv : @xmath75 , i.e. becomes _ exponentially _ small .",
    "moreover , one can get from the value of mgv an estimate of the localization length as @xmath76 note an important difference between the estimate of the localization length as inverse participation ratio and our estimate ( [ lloc ] ) .",
    "the former estimates a size of the domain where the eigenstate is localized , and is sensitive to particular short range dynamics for formation of the given state . on the contrary",
    ", the latter is related to the rate of the exponential falloff at the tails of the eigenstates , and characterizes properties of the disordered media .",
    "now let us turn to localization properties of phonons in the fk chain .",
    "as in the previous section , we concentrate on the numerical study of the chain with the rotation number @xmath77 , and parameter @xmath25 . in fig.[fgs_pr - mgv ] we present our comparison of pr and mgv for gs .",
    "one can see , that both quantities @xmath78 and @xmath72 look very similar .",
    "note , that @xmath72 for gs is well distinct from zero ( dotted line ) .",
    "this means , that all phonon states are _ not _ exponentially localized ; the smallness of @xmath78 and @xmath72 for some phonon modes means only that this modes are prelocalized only , which agree with earlier studies @xcite .    in order to see ,",
    "how the exponential localization manifest itself in pr and mgv , let us address to ces .",
    "we start with a typical ces , which is still in energy very close to gs : @xmath79 . despite to , that energy splitting is small , this ces belong to 5th band in the energy structure of ces @xcite , and it is one of @xmath28 cess with @xmath80 . in fig.[eloc ] we plot @xmath78 and @xmath72 for the same ces .",
    "it is seen that the behaviour of pr remains in main details the same , while in the mgv plot there are points , where the curve touches a _",
    "zero _ line .",
    "this means , that @xmath72 at these points is exponentially small , i.e. there is an _ exponential _ localization of these modes .",
    "note , that the pr plot at the same points has no clear indications that these modes are localized exponentially .",
    "some typical examples of nonlocalized mode @xmath81 and localized one @xmath82 for this ces is presented in fig.[exmods ] .",
    "we see , that the latter is perfectly localized exponentially , with a localization length @xmath83 , which characterizes a correlation length of disorder . for comparison",
    "we show also the same mode in the gs in a `` prelocalized '' state .",
    "in fact , ces with @xmath84 corresponds an early localization of phonon modes : only small fraction of the is exponentially localized , as seen from fig.[eloc ] . to get insight ,",
    "what modes are localized at the first turn , in fig.[wfr ] we plot mgv as a function of phonon frequency .",
    "we see , that localized modes are located at edges of the frequency spectrum bands .",
    "now , how this picture localization looks for ces with higher splitting from gs ?",
    "we expect @xcite , that at the splitting @xmath84 the largest robust elementary cells are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , that take part in mutual permutations only , while larger cells are destroyed . in the range of splitting",
    "@xmath87 the cell @xmath86 can dissociate @xcite , that increase a number of smaller cells @xmath85 and decrease a corelation length of the disorder . next , at splitting @xmath88 the cell @xmath85 can dissociate too , and permutations of cells @xmath89 come into play , that decrease a correlation length of the disorder even more . in apparent agreement with our expectations decrease of the disorder scale results in a total exponential localization of substantial fraction of phonon modes , especially in high frequency regoin , as seen from fig.[exw ] .    in fig.[loc2ex",
    "] we plot fo the same two ces our estimate for localization length ( [ lloc ] ) .",
    "two dotted lines show levels @xmath90 and @xmath85 , which correspond to expected sizes of largest robust elementary cells , which survive at energy splitting @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "we see , that minimal localization length follows the size of maximal robust structure in the chain .",
    "since the chain is not homogeneous , localization properties are not homogeneous too . as seen from figs .",
    "[ exw],[loc2ex ] , the localization is maximal at the high frequency part of phonon spectrum , while low frequency part seems nonlocalized .",
    "in fact , at least longwave modes of phonons show a clear tendency to be localized too , see fig.[lwstates ] .",
    "in this paper we have studied properties of phonon modes in the frenkel - kontorova chain , taken in the regime of pinned phase .",
    "spatial `` brick '' structure of the ground state of the chain found in @xcite , appears to be very useful for understanding the fine structure of the chain phonon spectrum .",
    "actually , similar analysis can also be performed for electronic spectrum , studied in recent work @xcite .    however , it is obvious , that in a real physical scale the ground state is highly degenerated with a huge number of the static configurational excitations states ( ces ) of the chain .",
    "actually this means that the true ground state of the chain is practically inaccessible .",
    "ces has properties quite different from that of the ground state : their spatial structure is rather chaotic @xcite . as a result",
    ", they can cause the anderson - like ( exponential ) localization of phonon modes similar to that seen in disordered media .",
    "this means , that results of previous studies of phonon@xcite and electron properties@xcite should be revized or extended to more realistic states of the chain .",
    "configurational excitation states ( ces ) can provide a possibility to study a gradual transition from the order to disorder .",
    "it is important , that the number of ces grows with energy splitting from the gs very fast .",
    "even at very small splitting the number of ecs is huge .",
    "it is curious that each particular ces has intrinsic chaos , which reminds the situation in classical spin glass @xcite , but in contrast to the latter , the chaos in ecs arises dynamically , without any external noise .",
    "the quantization of fk model in small @xmath93 limit is in essence the quantization of its phonon modes @xcite",
    ". therefore localization of phonon modes means localization of quantum states .",
    "note also , that phonon quantization problem is very close to electron quantization problem @xcite , where transition from localization to delocalized state is interesting as a insulator - metal transition .",

    "<S> we study numerically phonon modes of the classical one - dimensional frenkel - kontorova chain , in the regime of pinned phase characterized by the phonon gap and devil s staircase , as well as by a large number of states ( configurational excitations ) , which energy splitting from the ground state is exponentially small . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , these states behave like disorder media : their phonon modes are _ exponentially _ localized , in contrast to the phonon modes in the ground state , where phonons are _ prelocalized _ only .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate also , the phonon frequency spectrum of the ground state has an hierarchical structure , a direct manifestation of hierarchical spatial structure , found for the ground state of the fk chain in our recent work . </S>"
