    "since the discovery of substellar objects ( unable to fuse hydrogen stably in their interiors and with masses below 0.072@xmath3 , kumar @xcite ; chabrier et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , many efforts have been devoted to their characterization ( see basri @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recently , muench et al@xmath6 @xcite found evidence for the presence of disks around brown dwarfs ( bds ) of the trapezium cluster .",
    "muzerolle et al@xmath6 @xcite and martn et al@xmath6 @xcite reported on disk accretion in ttauri objects with masses near the substellar borderline .",
    "all these works may suggest that `` circumstellar '' disks are common among very young bds .",
    "these objects generally show h@xmath0 in emission , which seems to be variable . to the best of our knowledge , only a few bds with masses larger than 0.06@xmath3",
    "have been observed flaring ( rutledge et al@xmath6 @xcite ; basri & martn @xcite ) .",
    "here , we report on the detection of strong h@xmath0 emission in sori55 ( sorij053725.9023432 ) , which was previously identified as a cool , very low mass substellar member of the young @xmath2orionis open cluster ( zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite ; barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ data ] summarizes available spectrophotometric data for this object .",
    "we acquired low - resolution optical spectra of sori55 with the red module of the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke et al@xmath6 @xcite ) at the 10-m kecki telescope ( mauna kea observatory ) on 2001 january 31 .",
    "we used the 2048@xmath72048 pixel site detector ( 0.25pix@xmath8 ) , the 150linesmm@xmath8 grating blazed at 750.0 nm , the og570 filter for blocking the light blueward of 570.0 nm , and a 1.5-width slit , which provides a wavelength coverage of 6001030 nm , a spectral nominal dispersion of 4.0pix@xmath8 and a final resolution of 24  ( @xmath9@xmath1350 ) .",
    "the slit was rotated to be at a parallactic angle and minimize refraction losses .",
    "two individual exposures of 2400s each were obtained at different positions separated by 6  along the entrance slit .",
    "weather conditions were spectrophotometric , with seeing around 1.5 .",
    "raw images were processed with standard techniques that include bias subtraction and flat - fielding within iraf .",
    "nodded images were subtracted to remove earth s atmospheric contribution . a full - wavelength solution ( the @xmath10 of the fifth - order polynomial fit was 1 ) was achieved by calibrating sky emission lines as in osterbrock et al@xmath6 @xcite . to complete data reduction , we corrected for the instrumental response using data of the spectrophotometric standard star g191b2b obtained on the same night and with the same instrumental configuration .",
    "the resultant combined spectrum of sori55 is depicted in figure  [ lr ] ( s / n@xmath110 at 750 nm , and s / n@xmath115 at 905 nm ) .",
    "the spectra of the @xmath2orionis substellar member sori47 ( l1.5 , zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite ) and the field dwarf pc0025 + 0447 ( m9.5 , kirkpatrick , henry , & simons @xcite ) are also shown for comparison .",
    "we derived the spectral type of our target by matching its observed spectrum to data of standards , which were previously obtained with similar instrumentation .",
    "we also used the pc3 index of martn , rebolo , & zapatero osorio @xcite .",
    "we measured an m9 spectral class with an uncertainty of half a subclass , in full agreement with the previous assignement of barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 @xcite and with the observed @xmath11 colors .",
    "interestingly , sori55 displays typical low - gravity features ( allard et al@xmath6 @xcite ; martn et al@xmath6 @xcite ; luhman , liebert , & rieke @xcite ; bjar , zapatero osorio , & rebolo @xcite ) , such as the absence of nai @xmath12818.3,819.5 nm , and ki @xmath12762.1,766.7 nm atomic lines at the resolution of our data , and stronger molecular absorptions of vo and tio compared to field spectral counterparts .",
    "our measured upper limits to the line pseudo - equivalent widths ( pews , relative to the local observed pseudo - continuum formed by molecular absorptions ) are given in table  [ data ] .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than those of older objects in the pleiades and the field ( martn et al@xmath6 @xcite ; zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "the keck optical data of sori55 show a rather strong h@xmath0 line , which is seen in emission and with a different intensity between the two closely spaced spectra .",
    "a close - up region around h@xmath0 is displayed in figure  [ ha ] .",
    "sori55 appears very active ; however we found the same spectral type as barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 @xcite , suggesting that no significant continuum veiling of the visible photospheric features is present in the keck spectra .",
    "measuring h@xmath0 pews is not easy because the number of counts at the line pedestal is small ( 50140counts ) . in table",
    "[ data ] we provide heliocentric julian dates and our best pew measurements obtained via direct integration of the line profile adopting the pseudo - continuum level immediately adjacent to the line ( around @xmath13652.5 and @xmath13664.0 nm ) .",
    "the error bars were obtained after integrating over a reasonable range of possible continua .",
    "we are confident that the emission is larger in the second keck spectrum than in the first one , which was taken 43 minutes earlier .",
    "barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 @xcite found a less intense emission ( pew=5 ) in their vlt optical data taken @xmath11 month before the keck observations .",
    "this result and our observations indicate that sori55 has a variable h@xmath0 emission .",
    "spectroscopy , and optical and near - ir photometry are all consistent with sori55 s being a member of the @xmath2orionis cluster .",
    "but late - m stars are also common in the galactic disk , so we have considered the probability that sori55 might simply be an interloper field m9 dwarf in the direction toward the cluster ( lying at a distance between 118pc and 197pc in a volume of roughly 142pc@xmath14 ) . for this exercise",
    "we have used three - band photometry and the absolute magnitudes of field stars ( leggett et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "very recent all - sky surveys show that the space density of m8m9.5 dwarfs per cubic parsec is 0.0045@xmath150.0008 ( gizis et al@xmath6 @xcite ) . in our survey of the @xmath2orionis cluster ( zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , we found five candidates ( including sori55 ) with m9m9.5 spectral types in an interval of roughly 1mag ( barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "the probability of each candidate being a true member is in the range 8793% .",
    "the finding of such a large number of cool m dwarfs in our survey can be understood in terms of the much higher object density in the @xmath2orionis cluster than in the field .",
    "the very likely membership of sori55 in the @xmath2orionis cluster allows us to derive its mass by comparison with state - of - the - art evolutionary models .",
    "its effective temperature ( @xmath16 ) can be inferred from the spectral type and the optical - infrared colors .",
    "the calibration of basri et al@xmath6 @xcite gives @xmath16=2370k for an m9 dwarf , while luhman s @xcite scale , which is intermediate between dwarfs and giants , provides @xmath16=2550k .",
    "recently , bjar @xcite has derived a temperature calibration by matching observed low - resolution optical spectra of cluster m - type bds to a spectral synthesis computed for the dusty , log@xmath17=3.5 model atmospheres of allard et al@xmath6 @xcite ( see pavlenko , zapatero osorio , & rebolo @xcite ) .",
    "bjar @xcite found @xmath18=2500k for an m8.5 cluster member . because sori55 has a surface gravity around log@xmath17=4.0 , on the basis of theoretical models , its @xmath16 could be in the range 23702550k .",
    "less uncertainties exist in the calculation of the bolometric luminosity . using the photometry of sori55 and the bolometric corrections of monet et al@xmath6 @xcite , reid et al@xmath6 @xcite , and",
    "leggett et al@xmath6 @xcite , we derived log@xmath19=3.08@xmath150.25 .",
    "the uncertainty is mainly due to the error in the hipparcos distance ( perryman et al@xmath6 @xcite ) to the massive central star of the cluster .",
    "figure  [ sori55 ] illustrates the substellar mass - luminosity relationships of chabrier et al@xmath6 @xcite and burrows et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these two sets of evolutionary models deal with dusty atmospheres differently . while the former models assume that dust particles are formed in the atmosphere and remain there impacting the output energy distribution , the latter models treat dust as if condensed below the photosphere .",
    "sori55 may be coeval with other cluster members ; thus its mass can be easily deduced from the figure .",
    "the age of the @xmath2orionis association is discussed to some extent in zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these authors concluded that the most likely cluster age is 24myr , although ages as young as 1myr and as old as 8myr can not be discarded .",
    "further discussion of other cluster properties can be found in bjar et al@xmath6 @xcite and walter , wolk , & sherry @xcite . in figure  [ sori55 ]",
    "the vertical lines between 0.012@xmath3 ( chabrier et al@xmath6 @xcite ) and 0.015@xmath3 ( burrows , hubbard , & lunine @xcite ) denote the deuterium - burning mass limit , which separates bds and planetary - mass objects .",
    "values as high as 0.018@xmath3 can be found in the literature ( dantona & mazzitelli @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity of sori55 , its error bar , and possible ages are indicated with the region enclosed by the thick line .",
    "the filled circle stands for the most likely values of luminosity and age . using the chabrier et al@xmath6 @xcite models ,",
    "the mass of sori55 is estimated at 0.012@xmath150.004@xmath3 , i.e. , very close to the deuterium - burning mass threshold .",
    "the tracks of burrows et al@xmath6 @xcite yield smaller masses by @xmath110% .",
    "sori55 is defining the cluster frontier between bds and planetary - mass objects .",
    "it could be a planetary - mass cluster member if it were younger than @xmath13myr .",
    "this is the first time that very large h@xmath0 emission has been detected in a low mass substellar object .",
    "its origin remains unknown .",
    "sori55 may simply have undergone a chromospheric flare due to magnetic activity .",
    "this is supported by the rapid time variability of the line and the lack of a constant , significant emission .",
    "furthermore , no additional continuum appears to be veiling the photospheric spectral features .",
    "many dwarfs at the bottom of the m class experience strong and weak flares ( gizis et al@xmath6 @xcite ; martn & ardila @xcite ) . based on our data , we tentatively estimate that the flaring recurrence of sori55 is about 3366% , which contrasts with the 7%  value of the field coolest m dwarfs ( gizis et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "similarly intense h@xmath0 lines have been detected in just a few field objects of related @xmath16 .",
    "liebert et al@xmath6 @xcite observed a strong flare in 2masswj0149090 + 295613 ( m9.5 ) with h@xmath0 pews of 200300 , and many other emission lines of hei , oi , ki and caii .",
    "mould et al@xmath6 @xcite and martn , basri , & zapatero osorio @xcite reported variable and persistent h@xmath0 emission in pc0025 + 0447 ( m9.5 ) with pews between 100 and 400 .",
    "liebert et al@xmath6 interpreted the behavior of the 2mass object as that of a very cool m - type flare star , and they pointed out that this flare activity differs from that of pc0025 + 0447 .",
    "albeit with differences , the optical spectra of pc0025 + 0447 and sori55 seem more alike .",
    "burgasser et al@xmath6 @xcite argued that the former object could be an interacting binary .",
    "sori55 might also be double with one of the components losing mass to the other .",
    "our optical spectra do not suggest the presence of a warm component or a significant variation of the continuum over a month .",
    "rosat x - ray data provide an upper limit of log(@xmath20)@xmath210.9 to the x - ray emission of sori55 ( mokler @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that pc0025 + 0447 does not show significant x - ray flux ( neuhuser et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "the strong h@xmath0 emission of sori55 may have its origin in the object formation processes .",
    "haisch , lada , & lada @xcite found that the presence of dusty disks surrounding stellar members of clusters as young as the @xmath2orionis cluster is significantly high ( 50%65% ) .",
    "there are also clear indications of accretion events among the low mass star population of @xmath2orionis ( zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "however , accreting ttauri stars show continuous strong emission , whereas sori55 appears to have episodes of low and high activity .",
    "it could be that mass infall from protoplanetary disks onto central substellar - mass objects turns out to be unstable due to nonuniform disks and variable magnetic fields .",
    "sporadic accretion events may also indicate the end of the accreting activity in bds and planetary - mass objects .",
    "the mass infall rate seems to be rather small in objects around the substellar limit ( muzerolle et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "sori55 does not show an infrared excess in the @xmath22 band , which is consistent with a very low accretion rate . with current data we can not rule out any possible scenario ( flare activity , binarity , mass accretion ) .",
    "we have compared the h@xmath0 emission to the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath2orionis low mass members from the late - k spectral type ( stellar regime ) down to mid - l classes ( planetary - mass domain ) .",
    "h@xmath0 fluxes ( @xmath4 ) have been calculated as in herbst & miller @xcite , and bolometric corrections have been taken from various sources in the literature ( monet et al@xmath6 @xcite ; leggett et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "our results are portrayed in figure  [ habol ] . for comparison purposes",
    ", we have also included the averaged values of field stars with similar spectral types ( individual star data published by hawley , gizis , & reid @xcite , and gizis et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "the three observations of sori55 are clearly indicated .",
    "the ratio @xmath23/@xmath5 of cluster members with warm spectral types down to mid- and late - m classes appears to be rather dispersed around log@xmath4/@xmath5=3.61dex ( zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "cooler types ( corresponding to planetary - mass objects ) display a less intense ratio by about 0.6dex , which implies a decrease in the activity level ( less intense magnetic fields ) . on average , @xmath2orionis members , and",
    "remarkably those in the l classes , show higher h@xmath0 emissions than their older , field spectral counterparts . this feature could be explained partly as a decline in the strength of the chromospheric and flare activity with age and/or mass accretion from surrounding disks in the young objects",
    "this would indicate that magnetospheric mass infall could extend even beyond the deuterium - burning mass threshold , i.e. , into the planetary - mass domain .",
    "we are grateful to i@xmath6 baraffe and a@xmath6 burrows for providing us computer - ready files of their models .",
    "we also thank s@xmath6 kulkarni for his assistance in collecting data with the keck telescope , and louise good for correcting the english language .",
    "this paper is based on observations made with the w.m .",
