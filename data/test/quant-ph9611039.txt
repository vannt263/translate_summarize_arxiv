    "in order to gain information about a quantum state of the radiation field one has to measure some observable .",
    "the measurement process unavoidably involves some kind of interaction , thus coupling the mode under examination to one or more other modes of the field .",
    "one has to admit that , in general , the measured observable is not defined on the sole hilbert space of the signal mode @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "it reflects properties of the global state , possibly entangled , coming from the interaction among the signal mode and the set of the probe modes .",
    "sometimes , it is possible to get rid of these probe modes , so that the statistics of the output is related only to the quantum statistics of the signal mode .",
    "this , as an example , is the case of balanced homodyne detectors @xcite . in that case , in fact , an appropriate rescaling of the output photocurrent allows to completely neglect the local oscillator in the definition of the measured observable , which simply results to be proportional to the signal field quadrature @xmath0",
    ".    however , in more general cases this procedure can not be pursued and the output statistics always remind us the way we are probing the signal under examination .",
    "this is a common feature of three relevant detection schemes in quantum optics , which provide different setup for jointly measuring a couple of photocurrents .",
    "they are the heterodyne @xcite , the eight - port homodyne @xcite and the recently introduced six - port homodyne detectors @xcite .",
    "it is a purpose of this paper to show that , although they involve very different ways of coupling signal to probe modes , they provide the same information on the signal under examination .",
    "actually , we will prove their full equivalence by demonstrating that their output photocurrents have the same operatorial form .",
    "more surprisingly , this remains true also when taking into account the inefficiency of photodetection , even though the latter occurs at very different stages in the three detection schemes .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows . in the next section we briefly",
    "review how to describe inefficient photodetection in terms of beam splitters and ideal detectors . in the three sections [ s : eig],[s : het ] and [ s : tri ]",
