    "a strange quark star is a hypothetical type of exotic star composed of strange quark matter .",
    "this is an ultra - dense phase of degenerate matter theorized to form inside particularly massive neutron stars .",
    "it is theorized that when the degenerate neutron matter which makes up a neutron star is put under sufficient pressure due to the star s gravity , neutrons break down into their constituent up and down quarks .",
    "some of these quarks may then become strange quarks and form strange matter , and hence a strange quark star , similar to a single gigantic hadron ( but bound by gravity rather than the strong force ) . actually , until recently , astrophysicists were not sure there was a gray area between neutron stars and black holes , stellar remnants from a massive star s death had to be one or the other .",
    "now , it is thought there is another bizarre creature out there , more massive than a neutron star , yet too small to collapse in on itself to form a black hole .",
    "although they have yet to be observed , strange quark stars should exist , and scientists are only just beginning to realize how strange these things are .",
    "neutron stars , strange quark stars and black holes are all born via the same mechanism : a supernova collapse . but",
    "each of them are progressively more massive , so they originate from supernovae produced by progressively more massive stars .",
    "the collapsing supernova will turn into a neutron star only if its mass is about @xmath0 . in a neutron star ,",
    "if density of the core is high enough ( @xmath1 ) the nucleons dissolve to their components , quarks , and a hybride star ( neutron star with a core of strange quark matter ( sqm ) ) is formed . if after the explosion of the supernova density high enough ( @xmath1 ) , the pure strange quark star ( sqs ) may be formed directly .",
    "the composition of sqs was first proposed by itoh @xcite with formulation of quantum charmo dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of a compact star is its magnetic field which is about @xmath2 for pulsars , magnetars , neutron stars and sqs @xcite .",
    "this strong magnetic field has an important influence on compact stars .",
    "therefore , investigating the effect of an strong magnetic field on strange quark matter ( sqm ) properties is important in astrophysics . in recent years much interesting",
    "work has been done on the properties of dense astrophysical matter in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the effect of the strong magnetic field on sqm has been investigated using the mit bag model as well as the d3qm model of confinement @xcite .",
    "we have studied the effects of strong magnetic fields on the neutron star structure employing the lowest order constrained variational technique @xcite .",
    "recently , we have also calculated the structure of polarized sqs at zero temperature @xcite , the structure of unpolarized sqs at finite temperature @xcite , structure of the neutron star with the quark core at zero temperature @xcite and finite temperature @xcite , structure of spin polarized sqs in the presence of magnetic field at zero temperature using density dependent bag constant @xcite and at finite temperature using a fixed bag constant @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is calculating some properties of polarized sqs at finite temperature in the presence of a strong magnetic field using the mit bag model with a density dependent bag constant . to this aim , in section [ ii ] , we calculate the energy and equation of state of sqm in the presence of magnetic field at finite temperatures by mit bag model using a density dependent bag constant",
    ". finally in section [ sec4 ] , we solve the tov equation , and calculate structure of sqs .",
    "we study the properties of strange quark matter and resulting equation of state .",
    "the equation of state plays an important role in obtaining the structure of a star . from a basic point of view",
    ", the equation of state for sqm should be calculated by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "previous researchers have investigated the properties of the strange stars using diffrent equations of state with interesting results @xcite .",
    "there are many different models for deriving the equation of state of strange quark matter ( sqm ) such as mit bag model @xcite , njl model @xcite and perturbation qcd model @xcite . here",
    ", we use mit bag model using a density dependent bag constant to calculate the equation of state of sqm in the presence of a strong magnetic field .    the mit bag model confines three non - interacting quarks to a spherical cavity , with the boundary condition that the quark vector current vanishes on the boundary .",
    "the non - interacting treatment of the quarks is justified by appealing to the idea of asymptotic freedom , whereas the hard boundary condition is justified by quark confinement .",
    "this model developed in 1947 at `` massachusetts institute of technology '' . in this model quarks are forced by a fixed external pressure to move only inside a given spatial region and occupy single particle orbital .",
    "the shape of the bag is spherical if all the quarks are in ground state . inside the bag",
    ", quarks are allowed to move quasi - free .",
    "it is an appropriate boundary condition at the bag surface that guarantees that no quark can leave the bag .",
    "this implies that there are no quarks outside the bag @xcite .      in the mit bag model ,",
    "the energy per volume for the strange quark matter is equal to the kinetic energy of the free quarks plus a bag constant @xmath3 @xcite , which is the difference between energy densities of the noninteracting quarks and interacting quarks .",
    "there are two cases for the bag constant , a fixed value , and a density dependent value . in the initial mit bag model , two different values such as @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 were considered for the bag constant . since the density of strange quark matter increases from the surface to the core of a strange quark star , it is more realistic that we use a density dependent bag constant @xcite . by considering the experimental date received at cern ,",
    "the quark - hadron transition occurs at a density about seven times the normal nuclear matter energy density @xmath6 @xcite . by supposing that transition of quark - gluon plasma",
    "is only defined by the value of the energy density , the density dependence of @xmath7 has been considered to have a gaussian form , @xmath8 where @xmath9 parameter is equal to @xmath10 , and it has fixed value @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is a numerical parameter , and usually equal to @xmath13 , the normal nuclear matter density @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 depends only on the free parameter @xmath9 .    for obtaining @xmath14",
    ", we use the equation of state of the asymmetric nuclear matter , which should agree with empirical data . for computing the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", we apply the lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) many - body procedure as follows .",
    "the asymmetric nuclear matter is defined as a system consisting of @xmath15 protons @xmath16 and @xmath17 neutrons @xmath18 with the total number density @xmath19 and proton fraction @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the number densities of protons and neutrons , respectively . for this system",
    ", we consider a trial wave function as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the slater determination of the single - particle wave function and f is the a - body correlation operator @xmath25 , which is taken to be @xmath26 and is a symmetrizing operator .",
    "for the asymmetric nuclear matter , the energy per nucleon up to the two - body term in the cluster expansion is @xmath27)=\\frac{1}{a}\\frac{<\\psi|h|\\psi>}{<\\psi|\\psi>}=e_{1}+e_{2}.\\ ] ] the one - body energy , @xmath28 , is @xmath29 where labels @xmath30 and @xmath31 are used for the proton and neutron respectively , and @xmath32 is the momentum of particle @xmath33 .",

    "we use @xmath39 nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite .",
    "the procedure of these calculations has been studied in @xcite . according to this discussion ,",
    "we minimize the two - body energy with relation to the variations in the correlation function subject to the normalization constraint . from minimization of the two - body energy",
    ", we get a set of differential equations .",
    "we can compute the correlation function by numerically solving these differential equations .",
    "finally , we get the two - body energy , and then the energy of asymmetric nuclear matter .    the empirical consequence at cern acknowledge a proton fraction @xmath40 ( data are from probation accelerated nuclei ) @xcite.therefore to calculate @xmath14 , we use our results of the above formalism for the asymmetric nuclear matter characterized by a proton fraction @xmath40 . according to the following method , the assumptions of the hadron - quark transition takes place at energy density equal to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we find that the baryonic density of the nuclear matter is @xmath42 ( transition density ) . at densities lower than this value",
    ", the energy density of the quark matter is higher than that of the nuclear matter . by increasing the baryonic density ,",
    "these two energy densities become equal at the transition density , and above this value the nuclear matter energy density remains always higher .",
    "also , we determine @xmath43 by putting the energy density of the quark matter and that of the nuclear matter equal to each other .      in this section",
    ", we derive the eos of sqm in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "first , we calculate the energy of sqm . for this",
    ", we should find the quark densities in term of baryonic number density ( @xmath44 ) . by imposing charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium ( we suppose that neutrinons leave the system freely ) , we get the following relations @xcite , @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the chemical potential and @xmath50 is the number density of quark @xmath33 .",
    "we can ignore the electrons ( @xmath51 ) @xcite , and consider the strange quark matter ( sqm ) including u , d and s quarks .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath52    in the presence of the magnetic field , we have the spin polarized sqm including spin - up and spin - down u , d and s quarks .",
    "now , we introduce the polarization parameter as follows , @xmath53 in the above equation , @xmath54 is the number density of spin - up quark @xmath33 and @xmath55 is the number density of spin - down quark @xmath33 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    the chemical potential @xmath49 for any value of the temperature ( @xmath58 ) and number density ( @xmath50 ) is obtained using the following constraint , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is degeneracy number of the system and @xmath61 is the fermi - dirac distribution function . in the above equation @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "is the mass of quark @xmath33 .",
    "it should be noted that in our calculations , we ignore the masses of u and d quarks , and we consider @xmath64 .",
    "the energy of spin polarized sqm in the presence of the magnetic field within the mit bag model is as follows , @xmath65 where @xmath66 in our calculations , we suppose that @xmath67 . in eq .",

    "( [ 001 ] ) , and @xmath68 is the magnetic energy density of sqm , where @xmath69 is the magnetic energy .",

    "in fig . [ fig1 ] , we have plotted the polarization parameter versus the baryonic density in the presence of magnetic field ( @xmath89 ) at different temperatures . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the polarization parameter decreases by increasing the baryonic density .",

    "we can see that the free energy of spin polarized sqm increases by increasing the baryonic density , and at high densities , the increasing of free energy is faster than at low densities . at any density , the free energy decreases by increasing the temperature .",
