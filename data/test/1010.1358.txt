    "random privacy amplification based on the universal@xmath3 condition@xcite has been studied by many authors@xcite .",
    "this technique is originally aimed for random number extraction@xcite .",
    "it can be applied to secret key distillation ( agreement ) with public communication@xcite and wire - tap channel@xcite , which treats the secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "( for details of its application , see e.g. hayashi @xcite . ) when random privacy amplification is implemented by a universal@xmath3 hash function , it can yield protocols for the above tasks with a relatively small amount of calculation . similar to the study @xcite for random privacy amplification based on the universal@xmath3 condition , hayashi@xcite focused only on the mutual information with the eavesdropper .",
    "however , as the secrecy criterion , many papers in cryptography community @xcite dopt the half of the @xmath0 norm distance , which is also called the variation distance or eve s distinguishability .",
    "because this criterion is closely related to universally composable security @xcite , it is required to evaluate the leaked information based on the @xmath0 norm distance from cryptography community viewpoint .    in this paper , we adopt the @xmath0 norm distance as the secrecy criterion , and evaluate the secrecy for random privacy amplification while hayashi@xcite adopts the mutual information criterion . in the independent and identical distributed case , when the rate of generating random numbers is smaller than the entropy of the original information source , it is possible to generate the random variable whose @xmath0 norm distance to the uniform random number approaches zero asymptotically",
    ". however , in the real setting , we can manipulate only a finite size of random variables .",
    "so , the speed of this convergence is very important . in the community of information theory , in order to discuss the speed , we often focus on the the exponential rate of decrease .",
    "this rate is called the exponent , and is widely discussed among several topics in information theory , e.g. , channel coding@xcite , source coding@xcite , and mutual information criterion in wire - tap channel@xcite .",
    "however , the exponent has not been discussed in the community of cryptography as an important criterion .",
    "the purpose of this paper is establishing a systematic evaluating method for exponent for the @xmath0 norm distance in secure protocols .    in subsection [ s2a ] , for a given generating rate and a given source distribution , in the i.i.d .",
    "setting , we derive a lower bound of the exponent of the average of the @xmath0 norm distance between the generated random number and the uniform random number when universal@xmath3 hash function is applied",
    ". then , we introduce a stronger condition for hash functions , which is called strongly universal@xmath3 function , and show that our lower bound is tight under this condition . since our bound realizes the optimal exponent , it is thought to be powerful even for the finite length setting .",
    "we consider the @xmath4-independent and identical extension , and show that the exponential rate of decrease for this bound is tight under a stronger condition by using the type method@xcite . however , if our protocol generating the random number depends on the original distribution , there is a possibility to improve the exponent while it is known that asymptotic generation can not be improved@xcite . in subsection",
    "[ s3 ] , we derive the optimal exponent in this setting by using the cramer s theorem @xcite and the type method @xcite . comparing these two exponents , we can compare the performances between the protocol based on universal@xmath3 hash function and the protocol depending on the information source .    in information theory ,",
    "the part constructing the protocol achieving the rate is called the direct part . and",
    "the proof for non - existence surpassing the rate is called the converse part . concerning the exponent of the @xmath0 norm distance with universal@xmath3 hash function , the direct part is relatively simple while the converse part is more complicated .",
    "the converse part is regarded as an important topic in information theory , while it has been regarded as a minor topic in other research areas .",
    "in the direct part , we focus on bennett et al@xcite s evaluation for random privacy amplification , which employs the rnyi entropy of order 2 .",
    "this evaluation was also obtained by hastad et al @xcite and is often called leftover hash lemma . using the same discussion as renner @xcite",
    ", we derive an upper bound for the @xmath0 norm distance .",
    "renner @xcite applied @xmath5 approximation idea ( smoothing ) to min - entropy , which bounds the rnyi entropy of order 2 . in this paper , we apply the same idea to the rnyi entropy of order 2 .",
    "however , for the evaluation of the smoothing error , we use a method different from the method invented by holenstein - renner@xcite , but our method is standard in large deviation theory@xcite .",
    "in fact , as is shown in subsection [ s2b ] , our evaluation is much better than that by holenstein - renner@xcite .",
    "then , we obtain a bound based on the rnyi entropy of order @xmath1 as the main theorem ( theorem [ thm1 ] ) .",
    "note that , hayashi@xcite obtained a similar result using the rnyi entropy of order @xmath1 , but it evaluates the shannon entropy not the @xmath0 norm distance .",
    "contrastly , in the converse part , we employ type method , which was invented by csiszr and krner @xcite .",
    "the discussion of this part is quite technical , but conventional in information theory . concerning the exponent of the protocol depending on the original distribution ,",
    "the direct part can be shown by the combination of a new invented lemma ( lemma [ lemdi ] ) and cramer s theorem in large deviation theory@xcite .",
    "the converse part can be shown by very technical application of the type method@xcite .    in section [ s42 ] , we consider the case when an eavesdropper has a random variable correlated to the random variable of the authorized user . in this case , when the authorized user applies universal@xmath3 hash function to his random variable , he obtain a secure random variable .",
    "when we apply theorem [ thm1 ] to the security by @xmath0 norm distance in this setting , we obtain a tighter evaluation than existing evaluation than that directly obtained from hayashi@xcite .    in section [ s2 ] , we focus on wire - tap channel model , whose capacity has been calculated by wyner @xcite and csiszr and krner @xcite .",
    "csiszr @xcite showed the strong security , and hayashi @xcite derived bounds for both exponential rates of decrease for the mutual information between alice and eve and the security criterion based on the @xmath0 norm distance , which is simply called the @xmath0 security criterion .",
    "he obtained a bound for the exponential rate of decrease concerning the @xmath0 security criterion .",
    "however , their approaches are based on completely random coding . using the method of information spectrum@xcite ,",
    "hayashi @xcite showed strong security when universal@xmath3 hash function is applied in the privacy amplification process of wire - tap channel .",
    "but , the analysis on @xcite was based on the mutual information not the @xmath0 security criterion . in the paper@xcite , he invented a systematic method to construct a wire - tap channel code based on universal@xmath3 hash function , and evaluated the performance based on a privacy amplification theorem concerning the shannon entropy given in @xcite .",
    "so , we can expect that theorem [ thm1 ] plays the same role in evaluation of the @xmath0 security criterion in wire - tap channel model as a privacy amplification theorem concerning the shannon entropy given in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply theorem [ thm1 ] to wire - tap channel model , and obtain the evaluation of the exponent of the @xmath0 security criterion . in fact",
    ", we can evaluate the exponent of the @xmath0 security criterion from the evaluation for exponent concerning the mutual information in @xcite by applying the pinsker inequality to the mutual information .",
    "it is also shown in section [ s6 - 1 ] , that the evaluation obtained in this paper is better than that by @xcite and that obtained by application of pinsker inequality .    in section [ s6 ] , the same discussion as sections v and vi in @xcite",
    "can be applied to the @xmath0 security criterion with a suitable modification . in the additive noise case ,",
    "the obtained bound can be attained by linear operation .",
    "further , we obtain the bound for the @xmath0 security criterion in one - way secret key distillation by the same discussion as sections vi in @xcite . in appendix [ as2 ] , we prove theorem [ thm2 ] mentioned in subsection [ s2a ] . in appendix",
    "[ al9 - 9 - 1 ] , we prove lemma [ l9 - 9 - 1 ] given in subsection [ s3 ] .",
    "firstly , we consider the uniform random number generation problem from a biased random number @xmath6 , which obeys a probability distribution @xmath7 when its cardinality @xmath8 is finite .",
    "there are two types protocols for this problem .",
    "one is a protocol specialized for the given distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the other is a universal protocol that does not depends on the given distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the aim of this section is evaluate the performance of the latter setting . in the latter setting , our protocol is given by a function @xmath9 from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . in order to evaluate the protocol @xmath9 , we use the @xmath0 distance ( the variational distance ) @xmath12 and the @xmath13 distance @xmath14 these definitions can be extended when the total measure is less than @xmath15 i.e. , @xmath16 . in the following , we call such @xmath7 a sub - distribution .",
    "this extension for sub distributions is crucial for the later discussion .",
    "then , the quality of the random number obeying the distribution @xmath7 is evaluated by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the uniform distribution on @xmath10 .",
    "we also use the quantitty @xmath19 and the rnyi entropy order @xmath1 : @xmath20 the @xmath13 distance is written by using the rnyi entropy order @xmath21 as follows .",
    "@xmath22    now , we focus on an ensemble of the functions @xmath23 from @xmath10 to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes a random variable describing the stochastic behavior of the function @xmath23 .",
    "an ensemble of the functions @xmath23 is called universal@xmath3 hash when it satisfies the following condition@xcite :    @xmath26 , the collision probability that @xmath27 is at most @xmath28 .",
    "we sometimes require the following additional condition :    for any @xmath25 , the cardinality of @xmath29 does not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "this condition will be used in section iii .",
    "indeed , when the cardinality @xmath8 is a power of a prime power @xmath31 and @xmath32 is another power of the same prime power @xmath31 , as is shown in appendix ii of hayashi @xcite , the ensemble @xmath33 can be given by the concatenation of toeplitz matrix and the identity @xmath34@xcite only with @xmath35 random variables taking values in the finite field @xmath36 .",
    "that is , the function can be obtained by the multiplication of the random matrix @xmath34 taking values in @xmath36 . in this case ,",
    "condition [ c12 ] can be confirmed because the rank of @xmath34 is constant . for condition [ c1 ] ,",
    "see appendix ii of hayashi @xcite .",
    "bennett et al@xcite essentially showed the following lemma .",
    "a universal@xmath3 function @xmath23 satisfies @xmath37    this was also shown by hastad et al @xcite and is often called leftover hash lemma .",
    "now , we follow the derivation of theorem 5.5.1 of renner @xcite when one classical random variable is given .",
    "the schwarz - inequality implies that @xmath38 the jensen inequality yields that @xmath39 substituting ( [ 5 - 14 - 3 ] ) and ( [ 5 - 14 - 4 ] ) into the above inequality , we obtain @xmath40    using ( [ 5 - 14 - 6 ] ) , we can show the following theorem as a generalization of ( [ 5 - 14 - 6 ] ) .",

    "for any @xmath44 , we choose subset @xmath45 , and define the subdistribution @xmath46 by @xmath47 since @xmath48 , @xmath49 the inequality ( [ 5 - 14 - 6 ] ) yields @xmath50 for @xmath51 , we can evaluate @xmath52 and @xmath53 as @xmath54 combining ( [ 5 - 14 - 10 ] ) , ( [ 5 - 14 - 8 ] ) , and ( [ 5 - 14 - 9 ] ) , for @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath56 where we substitute @xmath57 into @xmath58 .",
    "next , we consider the case when our distribution @xmath59 is given by the @xmath4-fold independent and identical distribution of @xmath60 , i.e , @xmath61 . when the random number generation rate @xmath62 is @xmath63 , we focus on the _ exponential rate of decrease _ of @xmath64 , and consider the supremum .",
    "when an ensemble @xmath65 is a universal@xmath3 hash functions from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , theorem [ thm1 ] yields that @xmath68 on the other hand , when we apply the pinsker inequality@xcite to the upper bound for the mutual information obtained in hayashi@xcite , we obtain another bound @xmath69 , which is smaller than ( [ 4 - 19 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ 4 - 19 - 2 ] ) is equal to the optimal exponential rate in the fixed - length source coding .",
    "the following lemma is known @xcite :    assume that @xmath60 is a probability distribution and the random number generation rate @xmath63 is greater than the critical rate @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath74 is equal to the minimum exponent for correct decoding probability when the compression rate is @xmath63@xcite .",
    "this minimum exponent is equal to @xmath75@xcite .",
    "hence , we obtain the last equation .    in oder to show the tightness of the exponential rate decrease ( [ 9 - 7 - 1 ] ) under the universal@xmath3 condition , we consider the following ensemble .    for any @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the random variable @xmath78 is independent of @xmath79 for different arbitrary two elements @xmath80 .    under the strongly universal@xmath3 ensemble , and any subset @xmath81 with @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83    its proof is given in appendix [ as2 ] .",
    "using theorem [ thm2 ] and lemma [ lem9 ] with @xmath84 and applying the type method for fixed length source coding @xcite , we can show the following proposition :    let @xmath85 be the set of empirical distributions on @xmath10 with @xmath4 trials .",
