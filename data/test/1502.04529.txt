    "two - level emitters interacting with a cavity photon mode are widely studied in quantum optics with respect to spontaneous emission and superradiance  @xcite , cooperativity and lasing  @xcite , as well as the emission of nonclassical light  @xcite . for sufficiently weak light - matter coupling ,",
    "when the photon - dressing of emitter states is negligibly small , the emitter - cavity system can be studied with the quantum optical master equation , usually in combination with the rotating - wave approximation  @xcite .",
    "the quantum optical master equation fails at strong light - matter coupling , to the extent that it predicts unphysical emission at zero temperature if the number of photons in the ground state is finite  @xcite .    the correct theoretical description of systems with ( ultra-)strong light - matter coupling  @xcite has attracted increasing interest recently  @xcite .",
    "essentially , the quantum optical master equation has to be replaced by a master equation expressed in the photon - dressed emitter eigenstates  @xcite . while the master equation remains markovian , which is justified because of the weak emitter - environment and cavity - environment couplings  @xcite , it now requires full diagonalization of the interacting emitter - cavity hamiltonian .",
    "such an equation was used in recent studies of photon blockade effects  @xcite , spontaneous conversion of virtual to real photons  @xcite , and the emission of nonclassical light from a single emitter  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the emission of few emitters in a cavity , with particular focus on the photon statistics of the emitted light .",
    "our goal is the characterization of temperature and coupling regimes where nonclassical light  @xcite is generated .",
    "a major result will be the identification of two clearly distinguished neighboring regimes with pronounced sub - poissonian and super - poissonian photon statistics at strong coupling .",
    "our results are obtained with the full input - output formalism  @xcite and master equation  @xcite without further approximations . to understand the relevance of the different approximations involved in traditional quantum optics treatments we make two comparisons .",
    "first , we compare the results that are obtained when the counter - rotating light - matter interaction terms are included in the hamiltonian to those when they are dropped .",
    "second , we contrast the results obtained with the full master equation with results from the quantum optical master equation",
    ". the latter comparison will clearly show the necessity of using the correct master equation already at weak coupling if the photon statistics is of interest .",

    "the reason is that all emitters interact with the same cavity mode , which magnifies the effects of resonant emission and ( re-)absorption of cavity photons .",
    "broadly speaking , generation of nonclassical light is easier with more emitters because the required coupling of each individual emitter to the cavity mode can be reduced .",
    "our analysis of strong light - matter coupling required use of the full input - output formalism and of the full master equation , which carefully distinguishes between transitions at different energies . if this correct treatment is replaced by the standard quantum optical master equation results change completely .",
    "especially , the prediction of nonclassical light does not survive the additional approximations made in the replacement .",

    "this equation is the lindblad master equation that includes the lamb shift of the unperturbed system energies @xmath205 as well as reservoir induced dissipation effects to lowest order in the system - reservoir interaction strength .",

    "thus , energy level degeneracy introduces a block structure implying that a diagonal density matrix element couples to non - diagonal elements within diagonal blocks whereas energy transition degeneracy leads to a coupling of non - diagonal blocks to different non - diagonal blocks .",
