    "the hydrodynamics of polarizable fluids is an interesting and non - trivial topic which includes such subtle effects as counter propagation of free surfaces under the influence of external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations of the flow dynamics are hindered by the fact that the fluid is opaque .",
    "this seems to be the reason that investigations of the dynamic behavior of magnetic fluids are sparse , in spite of its tremendous technological potential @xcite .",
    "we feel that investigations of dynamic surface deformations , which can be optically detected , are a practical approach to get a quantitative measurement of the flow behavior . in our experiment",
    "we drive nonlinear oscillations of the free surface of a ferrofluid by making use of the technical advantage that hydrodynamic motion can be induced by time dependent magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic driving is particularly efficient in the neighborhood of static surface deforming instabilities , which can be achieved in super - paramagnetic fluids at relatively small external fields .",
    "these static instabilities are accompanied by hysteresis leading to a particularly rich behavior of the nonlinear surface oscillations . here",
    "we present an experimental investigation of such field induced surface deformations .",
    "the resulting bifurcation scenario of the nonlinear surface oscillations falls into a class which has never been studied experimentally .",
    "we discuss the results in terms of a qualitative model which captures the main features of the experimental findings .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ setup ] . in order to obtain a suitable compromise between viscosity and magnetic permeability , we use a mixture of the commercially available ferrofluids emg 901 ( ferrofluidics ) and emg 909 in a ratio of 7 to 3 .",

    "this is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical value @xmath20 am@xmath6 calculated for infinite fluid layer . according to the same theory",
    "the critical wavelength is expected to be 9 mm . due to aging of the fluid , presumably caused by evaporation of the carrier liquid , the critical field changes within one week by about 5% .",
    "the experimental runs shown below took on the order of hours , where aging effects can be estimated to be on the order of 0.1% .",
    "the fluid is filled in a cylindrical teflon vessel of 12 mm depth and 3 mm diameter which is small in comparison to the critical wavelength of the normal field instability in a two dimensional system and thus enforces the existence of a single peak .",
    "the upper 2 mm of the vessel has a slope with respect to the horizontal of @xmath21 , which is close to the measured contact angle between fluid and teflon , in order to provide a flat surface of the fluid @xcite .",

    "one coil consists of 474 windings of flat copper wire with a width of 4.5 mm and thickness 2.5 mm .",
    "a current of about 5 a is then sufficient to produce the magnetic field of about @xmath22 am@xmath6 used in this experiment .",
    "the static field is monitored by means of a hall probe ( group 3 dtm-141 digital teslameter ) located below the vessel .",
    "the dynamics of the ferrofluid surface is detected by a digital line scan camera ( i2s idc100 ) which is focused on the vertical axis through the center of the vessel .",
    "the time between two exposures is set to 6 ms .",
    "the analysis of the lines is done with a 90 mhz pentium - pc , equipped with a 6 bit interface board ( i2s ism197 ) for the line camera .",
    "the resolution in our experiment is 10.5 pixels per mm . for controlling the experiment the pc",
    "is also equipped with a synthesizer - board ( wsb-10 ) , and two programmable counters ( 8253 ) , located on a multifunction i / o - board ( meilhaus me-30 ) .",
    "the counters are used to keep track of the the pacing - frequency of the synthesizer - board .",
    "their output is used to trigger the camera in any desired phase of the driving oscillation of the magnetic field .",
    "thus we are using a phase - locked technique between the driving and the sampling in order to ensure a jitter - free measurement of the amplitude . by keeping track of the synthesizer pace the computer moreover manages the writing of the data into the synthesizer memory at times where no conflict with the da - converter arises .",
    "this allows for smooth switching of the amplitude of the ac - component of the magnetic field .",

    "we condense the richness of the scenario into three phase - diagrams , using three representative driving frequencies .",
    "the most complex behavior is observed at a driving frequency of 13 hz .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams simplify for smaller ( larger ) frequencies , for which we have taken 2.5 hz ( 23.5 hz ) as a representative .",
