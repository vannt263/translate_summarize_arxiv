    "the crab was the first source of gamma rays to be convincingly detected by ground based telescopes @xcite and measurements of its emission spectrum between @xmath8 and @xmath9 by various atmospheric erenkov detectors are now available @xcite .",
    "the flux measurement above @xmath10 recently reported by the stacee experiment , using the mirrors of a solar energy research facility to collect erenkov light , is the first detection below 200 gev by a ground based device @xcite . at these energies emission from the crab is steady and generally accepted to come from the nebula , arising from the inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photons observed at lower energies @xcite .    the egret detector on board the compton gamma ray observatory was used to study the crab from @xmath11 to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the differential energy spectrum measured by egret is well described by the sum of two power laws .",
    "below @xmath13 the steep spectrum is attributed to the synchrotron radiation from the nebula , while beyond @xmath13 the spectrum hardens and is dominated by pulsed emission .",
    "the detailed origin of the pulsar emission is uncertain .",
    "the outer gap @xcite and polar cap @xcite models offer differing pictures .",
    "current very high energy measurements create difficulties for some outer gap models @xcite but refining the picture requires observations in the heretofore uncovered @xmath14 region . determining the energy at which pulsed emission is again overtaken by the nebula flux is one of the goals of the present work .",
    "while the crab itself is a rather special object , the success of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model as applied to the nebula has wide implications . on the one hand ,",
    "this bright source is a test piece for the study of supernova remnants as the acceleration sites of high energy cosmic rays , with at issue the question of whether proton or electron acceleration dominates in a given source .",
    "in addition , the ssc mechanism is a cornerstone for the interpretation of the broadband spectra of agns of the blazar class @xcite . the experimental data from the crab which support the ssc picture consist of egret flux measurements up to @xmath12 , with large uncertainties in the region above @xmath15 @xcite , and the extrapolation across more than a decade in energy to the spectra measured by the atmospheric erenkov experiments .",
    "clearly , an independent measurement in the intervening @xmath16 region ( @xmath17 ) where the inverse compton peak in the power spectrum is expected to lie would further constrain the parameters of this important model .    the minimum energy threshold , @xmath18 , for current ground based imaging atmospheric erenkov experiments",
    "is limited to @xmath19 by the rate of accidental triggers due to the night sky light and , in the case of single mirror experiments , by the rate of local muon triggers .",
    "the simplest way to reduce the threshold of such an experiment is to increase the available mirror area , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 ; an approach which is being followed by the magic collaboration @xcite .",
    "alternatively , an array of smaller telescopes can be used to reach thresholds of @xmath22 as predicted for the veritas @xcite and hess @xcite experiments .",
    "these experiments are currently under construction and have not yet started taking data .",
    "celeste was designed to reach a very low energy threshold without a large expenditure of time and resources by exploiting the mirrors of an existing structure ; a de - commissioned solar farm in the french pyrenees .",
    "an array of 40 such mirrors , used by celeste to sample the arrival time and photon flux of the erenkov wave front at intervals of @xmath23 , provides a total mirror area of @xmath24 .",
    "celeste uses techniques similar to those pioneered by the early wavefront sampling experiments asgat @xcite and themistocle @xcite which operated on the same site , but uses a much greater mirror area and more sophisticated trigger logic and data acquisition electronics . unlike the imaging experiments",
    ", the wavefront sampling method gives no direct information about the shower morphology , but alternative methods of hadron rejection can be developed using the shape of the wavefront and the distribution of erenkov light on the ground . since",
    "their crab detection cited above , stacee has lowered their threshold to @xmath25 and expects to descend to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the graal experiment also uses a heliostat array but without secondary optics obtains a relatively high threshold of @xmath27 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the first measurement of the flux from the crab above @xmath28 , as well as an upper limit for pulsed emission , using the celeste heliostat array .",
    "we begin with a description of the experiment followed by a summary of the data sample and observation techniques .",
    "celeste exploits a new experimental technique so we outline the analysis method in some detail , including the results of extensive monte carlo simulations of the detector and the analysis of data taken in common with the cat imaging erenkov telescope . the gamma ray flux measurement and the pulsed flux upper limit",
    "are presented and the implications for the emission models are discussed .",
    "further details on these measurements and on the celeste experiment in general are available in @xcite .",
    "the celeste experiment is described in full detail in the experiment proposal @xcite and in @xcite . here",
    "we outline the most important features and the status of the experiment during the relevant observation period .",
    "[ principle ] illustrates the experimental principle .",
    "celeste uses 40 heliostats of a former solar electrical plant at the thmis site in the eastern french pyrnes ( n. @xmath29 , e. @xmath30 , altitude @xmath31 ) .",
    "each back - silvered heliostat mirror has an area of @xmath32 and moves on an alt - azimuth mount .",
    "the heliostats are controlled from the top of a @xmath33 tall tower , located south of the heliostat field , which houses the secondary optics , photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) and data acquisition system .",
    "the alignment of the heliostats has been verified by mapping the images of bright stars using the pmt anode current .",
    "the light from all 40 heliostats is reflected to the top of the tower . to separate these signals from each other we use a secondary optical system , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ optics ] .",
    "we have chosen to place the photomultiplier assembly on the optical axis to minimize coma aberrations , although this results in a loss of light due to the shadow formed .",
    "the spherical mirrors of the secondary optics are divided into six segments on three levels with three different focal lengths in order to reduce this shadowing effect and to produce images of approximately the same size regardless of the heliostat position in the field .",
    "one large segment views the farthest heliostats , two others view those at intermediate distance , and three small segments are used for the heliostats at the foot of the tower . at the secondary mirror focus",
    "is the entrance face of a solid winston cone glued to a two - inch pmt ( philips xp2282b ) , one for each heliostat .",
    "the winston cone determines the surface area of the secondary mirror seen by that pmt , such that the optical field - of - view of each tube is @xmath34 mrad ( full width ) .",
    "this field - of - view is slightly smaller than the angular size of air showers in our energy range and helps maximze the ratio of erenkov to night sky light .",
    "the single photoelectron ( pe ) pulse width , after pre - amplifiers ( gain=100 , ac - coupled ) and 23 m cables to the counting house , is just under @xmath35 ( full width at half maximum ) .",
    "pmt gains are set reasonably low ( @xmath36 ) to avoid damage to the tubes from night sky light , and the electronic gains are such that the amplitude of a single photoelectron in the counting house is @xmath37 on average .",
    "these amplitudes were measured _ in situ_. in fact , studies of the average response of each detector to the hadronic background events have enabled us to calibrate the relative efficiency of each heliostat , and the pmt high voltages are now set so as to correct for this ( in the range @xmath38 ) in order to give an even trigger response across the heliostat field .",
    "the pmt signals are sent to both the trigger electronics and to the data acquisition system .",
    "the trigger is designed to reach the lowest possible threshold .",
    "programmable analog delays compensate for the changing optical path lengths as the source direction changes during the observation .",
    "the switched - cable delays broaden the pe pulse widths by a full nanosecond for the maximum delay .",
    "eight pmt signals are summed in each of five groups as shown in fig .",
    "[ trigger ] , and the sums enter a discriminator .",
    "programmable logic delays further compensate for the varying path lengths between the trigger groups .",
    "the logic delay introduces a deadtime of the order of 5% .",
    "a trigger requires the logic coincidence of at least three of the five groups , with an overlap of @xmath39 .",
    "the analog sum over eight heliostats provides us with a good signal to noise ratio for the erenkov pulse , while the logic coincidence removes triggers due to afterpulsing in the pmts , local muons or low energy hadronic events illuminating only a few heliostats .",
    "each pmt signal is further amplified ( @xmath40 ) and sent to an 8-bit flash adc ( fadc ) circuit ( etep 301c ) that digitizes the signal at a rate of @xmath41 ( 1.06  ns  per  sample ) .",
    "the depth of the fadc memory is 2.2  @xmath42s , and one photoelectron corresponds to 3 digital counts .",
    "when a trigger occurs , digitization stops and a window of 100 samples centered at the nominal erenkov pulse arrival time is read out via two vme busses in parallel .",
    "readout requires @xmath43 , which for typical raw trigger rate of 25 hz gives an acquisition deadtime fraction of @xmath44 .",
    "the trigger also latches a gps clock , which is read out and included in the data stream . in parallel with the erenkov pulse data acquisition ,",
    "scalers record the single group trigger rates , the final trigger rate , and the readout rate . acquisition deadtime is determined from the latter two .",
    "the anode current of each pmt ( @xmath45 ) is also recorded , as is some meteorological information .",
    "the observations presented here were taken on clear , moonless nights during the crab season between november 1999 and march 2000 .",
    "all the data were taken when the source was within 2.5 hours of transit , that is , with an angle from the zenith , @xmath46 .",
    "the observations were made in the on - off tracking mode , in which an observation of the source is followed or preceded by an observation at the same declination offset in right ascension by an appropriate amount ( usually 20 minutes ) .",
    "the offset region is then used as a reference to provide a measure of the background of cosmic ray events .",
    "it is particularly important in the case of celeste to cover the same elevation and azimuth ranges during the on and the off source observations as the heliostat optical collection efficiencies change appreciably due to the projection of the heliostat surface viewed by the pmts , and ( less importantly ) due to optical aberrations .",
    "both of these effects depend upon the heliostat orientation and thus upon the source direction .",
    "in addition , matching on and off source observations ensures that the on and off data were taken using exactly the same path through the delay electronics .",
    "celeste has a number of options when deciding how to observe a source .",
    "the majority of the data here were taken in `` single pointing '' , wherein all the heliostats were aimed at a point @xmath47 upward from the center of the heliostat field towards the source such that the center of their fields of view converged at the expected maximum point of erenkov emission for gamma showers .",
    "this method collects the largest number of photons , allowing us to operate with the lowest possible energy threshold .",
    "it seems likely , however , that other pointing strategies may provide better sampling across the shower and hence better hadron rejection . with this in mind , a smaller number of runs were taken using `` double pointing '' in which half the heliostats pointed at @xmath48 , and the other half at @xmath49 .",
    "a monte carlo study of some different pointing methods is available in @xcite .",
    "the observing log is summarised in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the trigger logic was set such that 3 groups out of the 5 were required to exceed their discriminator threshold in order to trigger the experiment .",
    "the discriminator threshold levels for each of the 5 trigger groups are checked nightly by measuring the trigger rate as a function of discriminator level in order to find the break point between accidental coincidences of random noise pulses and erenkov flashes .",
    "we set the discriminators such that the noise triggers contribute less than 1% of the total rate ( fig .",
    "[ trigrate ] ) . for more than 90% of the crab data the discriminator level was set to @xmath50",
    ", that is , an average of @xmath51 for each of the 8 heliostats in a group , giving a final trigger rate of @xmath52 . expressing the discriminator level for the analog sum of 8 heliostats in a group in terms of pe per heliostat implies that the cerenkov pulses for each heliostat are perfectly in time with each other .",
    "we have checked this timing by reconstructing the group sums using the fadc data ( although the path to the trigger electronics is not identical to the acquisition path ) and by oscilloscope measurements during observations . for the data in this paper , three channels were as much as 2 ns out of time , while the other 37 channels were less than 1 ns from the average .",
    "the three outlying channels have since been corrected , and the group sum pulses are now routinely digitized using additional fadcs .",
    "the pmt anode current information and the measured trigger rates of each group are very sensitive to changes in the sky conditions and are used to verify that the atmosphere was stable throughout the on - off pair . any data which showed evidence of poor",
    "weather or equipment problems were rejected .",
    "the remaining total data set consists of 14.3 hours of on - source exposure .",
    "here we outline the important stages in the analysis of celeste data ; data cleaning , shower reconstruction and hadronic background rejection .",
    "we also present the results of extensive monte carlo simulations which have been used to derive the analysis techniques and to estimate the sensitivity and threshold of the experiment .",
    "celeste has the advantage of being situated on the same site as a well calibrated atmospheric erenkov imaging telescope , cat @xcite .",
    "this has allowed us to examine the collection efficiency for a subset of the celeste data and should in the future allow us to cross - calibrate energy , direction , and acceptance between cat and celeste .      for each event which triggers celeste , we record a window of @xmath53 around the erenkov pulse for each pmt using fadcs with a sampling period of @xmath54 ( i.e. 100 samples ) .",
    "the fadc window is chosen such that the erenkov pulse is expected to arrive in its center .",
    "the beginning of the fadc window ( the first 30 samples ) is used to calculate the pedestal level .",
    "a small constant voltage offset applied to the unipolar input of each fadc allows fluctuations in the night sky background to be measured .",
    "significant differences in the amplitude @xmath55 of these fluctuations can be seen depending upon the brightness of the region of sky viewed by the pmt .",
    "the possibility of systematic effects in the data due to differences in night sky background levels between the on and off source regions of the sky is a known problem for atmospheric erenkov experiments .",
    "@xcite proposed a method of `` software padding '' , for use with the whipple telescope , in which the noise fluctuations of the adc signals from the darker region of sky are artificially increased to the same level as the brighter region by adding from a randomly sampled gaussian distribution .",
    "the effects of night sky light differences can be seen at both the trigger level and in parameter distributions during the analysis procedure .",
    "these systematic effects produce a significant difference between the number of events remaining from the on source and off source regions after analysis cuts",
    ". the difference can be either positive or negative , depending on which region is the brighter , and a positive difference mimics a real signal .",
    "celeste is particularly prone to these problems due to its large mirror area and angular acceptance per pmt which combine to give a night sky light background rate of @xmath56 .",
    "the use of fadcs introduces another complication in the case of celeste : if we wish to extract more information than just the integrated charge over the pulse , a simple addition of charge sampled from a night sky background distribution to the measured charge is not sufficient .",
    "the effect of additional sky noise on the complete erenkov pulse shape must be accounted for .",
    "the only way to equalize the night sky background fluctuations in software then , is to simulate the response of the pmt - fadc electronics chain to an increased rate of single photo - electrons .",
    "we model the single pe pulse using events triggered by cosmic ray muons passing through the winston cones , in standard operating conditions except with the tower door closed , blocking outside light .",
    "these pulses contain many ( @xmath57 ) pes , generated at the photocathode at almost exactly the same time so to a good approximation the muon pulse shape is the same as that of a single pe , only of greater amplitude .",
    "the results agree with those obtained on a test bench with an oscilloscope , and with single pe pulses measured by the fadc s , using much higher pmt gains which change the pmt time response somewhat . by simulating the fadc response to single pes arriving at different rates ,",
    "we obtain a calibration curve of measured fluctuation against the background rate of pes due to night sky light of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant and @xmath60 is the night sky background rate in @xmath61 per ns .",
    "this curve can be used to calculate the rate of simulated pes which needs to be added to the darker field in order to equalize the night sky background fluctuations .",
    "software padding has been applied to all the on - off pairs used in this analysis but this alone is not sufficient to remove all the biases caused by night sky background differences as a brighter region of sky also causes a slight increase in the amount of near threshold events which trigger the experiment .",
    "this can be explained as follows : additional night sky background fluctuations cause showers which would otherwise be below threshold to trigger .",
    "they also prevent some events which would otherwise be above threshold from triggering , but because the cosmic ray spectrum is very steep , the former effect is bigger than the latter , and there is a net night sky background dependent increase in the number of triggered events .",
    "we have therefore found it necessary to apply a `` software trigger '' at a level higher than the hardware trigger level , in order to remove these additional small events . using the fadc data ,",
    "we reconstruct the analog sum pulses seen by each of the five trigger groups and then apply the condition : @xmath624 groups @xmath63 per heliostat .",
    "this provides us with comparable background data in the on and off fields , and reduces the fraction of events triggered by accidental noise coincidences to less than @xmath64 , but has the effect of increasing the energy threshold of the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ ethresh ] ) .    to test the performance of the software trigger , we have divided the crab data set into two subsets , based on the sign of the difference in the average pmt currents between the on and off source observations .",
    "[ sttest ] shows the difference between the on and off source observations for the distribution of the total charge measured in all the erenkov pulses for these two subsets .",
    "a clear bias in the number of small events is apparent in the raw data , with the direction of the bias depending upon the sign of the current difference .",
    "after application of the software trigger , the bias has been removed .",
    "in order to use the information recorded by the fadcs , it is necessary to select and parameterize the erenkov peaks .",
    "this is done by fitting a function of the following form : @xmath65    where @xmath66=time in nanoseconds , @xmath67=peak time and @xmath68=peak amplitude .",
    "[ peaks ] shows some examples of fitted peaks and illustrates the effect of saturation in the fadcs .",
    "studies using simulated peaks indicate that the peak fitting algorithm can accurately reconstruct the timing and charge information for peaks which have saturated the fadcs up to twice their dynamic range .",
    "the fit parameters for each peak are stored for use later in the analysis . only events having at least 10 erenkov peaks with an amplitude greater than 25 digital counts ( @xmath69 p.e . )",
    "are used in the analysis ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "imaging erenkov telescopes have become the most powerful instruments at energies greater than @xmath71 due to their efficiency in reducing the hadronic background . typically , it is possible to reject over 99% of the background events while retaining 50% of the gamma ray signal @xcite . at celeste energies ,",
    "a smaller total number of photons and intrinsic fluctuations in the shower development mean that the differences between the gamma and hadron showers which trigger are less pronounced .",
    "in addition the small field of view of celeste , which is necessary to keep the night sky light background at a reasonable level , often truncates the shower , again causing hadron and gamma showers to look alike .",
    "these points , and also the fact that the trigger system rejects many hadron showers at the hardware level , mean that hadron rejection at the analysis stage is not very efficient for celeste ; however , small differences do remain , as the gamma showers tend to develop in a more regular manner than the hadron showers .",
    "we have written a complete detector simulation package , including a full treatment of the complicated optical system of celeste and a detailed model of the trigger and acquisition electronics , for use with standard air shower simulation packages . using the monte carlo simulations we have investigated various ways of exploiting the fadc timing and charge information to provide hadron rejection .",
    "two rather simple parameters have been studied in detail : the group homogeneity , @xmath72 , and the shower axis angle , @xmath73 .",
    "the group homogeneity is a measure of the homogeneity of the erenkov light pool at ground level .",
    "it is determined from the variance in the amplitude of the five trigger group pulses normalized to the mean amplitude .",
    "the trigger group pulses are derived by summing the 8 fadc windows of the heliostats in each group .",
    "@xmath74    where @xmath75 are the amplitudes of the 5 reconstructed trigger group pulses .",
    "[ sigmagrp ] shows the distribution of @xmath72 for gamma rays and off source data after applying the software trigger and requiring a minimum of 10 erenkov peaks .",
    "the gamma rays were simulated over a range of azimuth and zenith angles so as to match the range covered by all the data for the @xmath76 crab data set described in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the off source data shown is the sum of all the off source data in this data set . according to this plot , a cut at @xmath77 conserves @xmath78 of the gammas which remain after the software trigger , while rejecting @xmath79 of the remaining hadrons , giving a quality factor q=1.6 where :    @xmath80    and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the fraction of gammas and hadrons conserved by the cut respectively .",
    "low energy gamma ray air showers are only a few kilometres long and the majority of the erenkov light is emitted from a small region .",
    "the erenkov wavefront is therefore spherical to a good approximation ( fig .",
    "[ spherefit ] ) . using the arrival times of the erenkov pulses we are able to reconstruct this wavefront using an analytical @xmath83 minimization procedure @xcite .",
    "assuming that the point of emission was at a fixed distance @xmath84 from the site towards the source , the fit gives the position @xmath85 of the shower maximum relative to the tracked point , @xmath86 .",
    "simulations indicate that this position is reconstructed with an error of @xmath87 .",
    "it is important to know the timing resolution for each detector when making the fit .",
    "we have calculated this resolution by studying the response to a nitrogen laser pulse sent to a diffuser mounted at the top of the tower .",
    "the same laser was used for a similar purpose by the themistocle experiment on the same site @xcite .",
    "the timing resolution is also dependent upon the background night sky light level and on the amplitude of the pulse .",
    "this dependency is difficult to test with the laser so we have measured it by generating simulated peaks , adding them to real night sky background data and then comparing the reconstructed peak time with the known injection time of the simulated peak .",
    "the resolution reaches @xmath88 ns for peaks well above the night sky noise level , and is worse for larger and smaller peaks due to fadc saturation and relatively larger night sky fluctuations , respectively .    using the expected point of maximum emission",
    "we can attempt to measure the angle , @xmath73 , of the shower axis relative to the pointing direction , which will be zero in the case of gamma rays originating from a point source at the center of the field of view . to do this",
    "we need a second point at ground level , simply calculated by taking the mean position of the heliostats on the ground , weighted by the charge sampled by each detector .",
    "more complex algorithms have been tested for calculating the impact parameter , but none has proved more effective than this simple method , which gives a @xmath89 error of @xmath23 according to the simulations .    the distribution of @xmath73 for simulated gammas and for real off source data after the software trigger , requiring a minimum of 10 erenkov peaks and @xmath90 is shown in fig .  [ theta ] .",
    "as expected , the simulated gamma rays concentrate at small values of @xmath73 , with an angular resolution of @xmath91 .",
    "unfortunately the hadronic background showers , although simulations suggest that they can trigger the experiment from as far away as @xmath92 from the pointing axis , are reconstructed with an angular spread of only @xmath93 .",
    "a cut on @xmath73 alone at @xmath94 predicts a quality factor of only 1.1 after the other cuts have been applied .",
    "in addition to the crab nebula , celeste has recently been used to detect gamma ray emission from the tev blazar markarian  421 @xcite .",
    "observations made at the same time by the cat experiment allowed us to know the status of this highly variable source . the source was observed in december 1999 in a quiescent state and in january and february 2000 in an active state , with flares reaching a level of @xmath95 according to cat .",
    "the results from the celeste analysis show a non - detection for the december period ( a significance of @xmath96 for @xmath97 of on source data ) and a very significant ( @xmath98 for @xmath99 ) detection for the january - febuary observations .",
    "these results are noted here as they provide further convincing evidence for the stability of the celeste analysis .",
    "the on source star field for the region of mkn  421 contains a star of magnitude 6.1 in the center of the field .",
    "this causes the measured average pmt anode currents for the on source fields to be typically 13% higher than for the off field .",
    "the sky noise differences in the case of the crab vary by as much as @xmath100 but for all data pairs the dispersion is about @xmath101 , and the mean difference is smaller than our measurement error .",
    "the non - detection of mkn  421 in december 1999 implies that the celeste analysis has correctly dealt with the systematic effects in the data due to sky noise differences for this problematic source",
    ". we can therefore be confident that the smaller sky noise differences in the case of the crab observations do not pose a problem , and that our result presented in this paper is not significantly biased by systematic effects .",
    "our flux determination uses the results of the analysis of the larger of the two data sets listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] : the @xmath102 of observations with all heliostats pointing at @xmath103 .",
    "the filled circles in figs .",
    "[ sigmagrp ] and [ theta ] show the distribution of the excess events in the on source data for @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "as predicted for a gamma ray signal , the on source excess concentrates at low values of @xmath72 .",
    "table  [ tab : crablow ] shows the number of events which remain from the on and off source observations after the pre - analysis and analysis cuts .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the first two cuts ( the software trigger and @xmath70 ) serve only to correct for night sky background differences and to ensure that there is enough information to reconstruct the shower reasonably well .",
    "the remaining cuts have been optimized on the simulations in order to reduce the hadronic background and improve the signal to noise ratio . as expected from the simulations ,",
    "the most effective cut parameter is @xmath104 , with an observed quality factor of 1.4 , lower than the predicted 1.6 ( quality factors calculated after the software trigger and @xmath105 cuts ) .",
    "we note that at each stage of the analysis , after the initial pre - analysis cuts , the ratio of excess to background increases , from an initial value of 0.6% , to 5.0% when all cuts are applied .",
    "however , we determine the crab flux without using the cut on @xmath73 , as the monte carlo predicts only a small improvement in the significance of the result yet adds another source of error into the flux estimation . after the @xmath104 cut we find an excess of 2727 events , implying a rate of @xmath106 and a final statistical significance of @xmath107 .",
    "table  [ tab : effall ] shows the cut efficiencies at each stage of the analysis procedure for the off source data , for the real crab on - off source excess , and for the simulated gamma rays .",
    "the agreement between the measured excess and the gamma simulations is reasonable , given the large errors on the excess fraction .",
    "we have also analysed the other set of crab observations taken in a `` double pointing '' mode , with half the heliostats pointing at @xmath103 and the other half at @xmath108 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : crabdouble ] .",
    "a statistically significant signal is apparent in this smaller data set , the gamma ray rate being @xmath109 after all cuts , and @xmath110 without the @xmath73 cut .",
    "the monte carlo predicted an improvement in sensitivity with this pointing strategy due to its less - biased sampling of the erenkov light distribution at ground level , particularly for those showers with large impact parameters . in consequence ,",
    "the cut on the homogeneity of the light distribution , @xmath104 , becomes more effective at rejecting the hadronic background .",
    "more data is needed to confirm the double pointing crab sensitivity of @xmath111 , compared to @xmath112 for single pointing .",
    "double pointing is now the preferred method of operation for celeste .",
    "further work is under way in order to determine the optimum pointing altitudes , trigger configurations and analysis methods .      atmospheric erenkov telescopes , unlike satellite experiments ,",
    "can not be calibrated with a test beam .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the detector response to air showers are therefore the most important tool for calculating both the detector sensitivity and determining the best analysis strategies .",
    "the work presented here has made use of the kaskade shower simulation package @xcite .",
    "tests using version 4.5 of the corsika package @xcite indicate an effective surface area for gamma rays @xmath11325% higher than that of the kaskade simulations , regardless of the initial photon energy .",

    "the curve after cuts can be parametrized as @xmath115 @xmath116 , with @xmath117 in gev .",
    "the area is an order of magnitude smaller than for an imaging telescope because convergent viewing restricts the impact parameter at which a gamma shower will be seen by enough heliostats to trigger the experiment .",
    "a valuable partial test of our effective area calculations can be made by using those showers which trigger both cat and celeste .",
    "approximately 20% of the celeste events , corresponding to around 30% of cat events are common and can be identified as such , with a probability better than 99.9% , by their arrival time measured with gps clocks by the two experiments . during this observing season",
    "we have collected 13 hours of common data on the crab .",

    "according to this definition , the energy threshold for celeste at the raw trigger level for a source at the position of the crab at transit is @xmath121 . from the zenith , which is the same position as for the crab at transit . ]",
    "the gamma rays have been simulated with the same distribution of azimuth and zenith angles as the 11 km crab observations , increasing the energy threshold to @xmath122 at the raw trigger stage .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , a software trigger is applied during the analysis to correct for night sky background effects in the data .",
    "this increases the energy threshold to a level of @xmath123 .",
    "further analysis cuts ( @xmath70 and @xmath114 ) reduce the number of gamma rays observed , but do not increase the energy threshold .",
    "the systematic errors on our measurement have two different origins .",
    "the uncertainty on the energy scale is due principally to errors in the conversion of the measured signal to a flux of erenkov photons , which is a combination of many factors ( photon losses through the optical system , pmt quantum efficiencies , electronic calibration errors ) .",
    "we bracket the overall uncertainty arising from the combination of these elements as follows .",
    "first , during the celeste prototype studies we measured the night sky background in our wavelength range at themis to be @xmath124 @xcite , in the direction of the crab at transit ( 20 degrees south of zenith , towards the populated valley below the site ) . from this",
    "we expect 1 photoelectron per nanosecond per phototube , corresponding to anode currents of @xmath125a , close to the observed range around @xmath126a .",
    "studying the fadc pedestal widths used in the padding software also yields values of @xmath127 photoelectron per nanosecond per phototube .",
    "we further compare currents measured while aligning the heliostats using star scans with predictions from the optical simulation : the measured values are typically 20 % less than expected .",
    "results of studies of the atmospheric extinction using ccd photometry and a lidar will be reported in future work but are not included in the present study . finally , the observed cosmic ray trigger rate is 30% higher than predicted by the monte carlo .",
    "from these considerations we believe the energy scale uncertainty to be less than @xmath128% .",
    "the corresponding acceptance curves are @xmath129 , leading to an uncertainty on our threshold .",
    "the input spectrum assumed in determining the absolute flux ( see discussion below ) has little effect on the threshold . for this analysis",
    "then , we quote an energy threshold of @xmath3 .",
    "the other principal source of systematic error is the uncertainty on our efficiency for detecting gamma rays .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there is an energy independent discrepancy of 25% in the effective surface area as calculated using two different shower generation monte carlos .",
    "both monte carlo s use the u.s .",
    "standard atmosphere .",
    "@xcite recently explored the effects of different atmospheric profiles on the cherenkov light yield , finding a @xmath130 variation for 100 gev gamma rays for midlatitude summer and winter atmospheres , neglecting aerosol variations .",
    "we conclude that the uncertainty in the cherenkov light yield for gamma rays in our energy range is 25% .",
    "we also assign a systematic error of 10% to the cut efficiencies deduced from the simulations ( table 3 ) .      at present",
    "the event - by - event energy determination in celeste is poor . to compare our rate measurement with models and with results from other experiments requires convoluting our detector acceptance , @xmath131 ( see fig .",
    "[ effsurf ] ) , with an assumed source spectrum .",
    "the simplest hypothesis is that of a power law differential flux , @xmath132 . in a @xmath133 representation ( or , equivalently , @xmath134 )",

    "below @xmath139 we let @xmath141 be a free parameter , but require continuity at 500 gev .",
    "we determine @xmath142 such that the convolution with @xmath131 yields our measured rate and thus obtain an integral flux of @xmath143 .",
    "we further vary @xmath141 and determine that the range of ( @xmath144 to @xmath145 is consistent with the rate and acceptance uncertainties , including that of the energy scale . repeating the process using the whipple @xcite , or",

    "one of the primary goals of the celeste experiment is to investigate the periodic emission from gamma ray pulsars in the cutoff region below 100 .",
    "the celeste data include the arrival time of each event measured to a precision of @xmath149s using a time - frequency processor slaved to a global positioning system ( gps ) clock which provides synchronisation every second .",
    "this timing information has been used to search for evidence of periodicity in our crab data .    in order to verify our periodic analysis procedure",

    "a gps time reference was obtained for the optical data by sending the same pulse every @xmath154 as a trigger to celeste and as data to the adc card .",

    "to date we have no evidence of a pulsed signal .",
    "we present the pulsar search using the same analysis as used to measure the steady emission flux , that is , applying the software trigger , @xmath70 and @xmath114 .",
    "although this raises our energy threshold , we take this cautious approach because the efficiency is better understood .",

    "[ phasograms ] .",
    "table  [ tab : pulsed ] summarises the contents of the plots as well as the results of the h - test @xcite .",
    "the distributions are statistically flat . in order to calculate upper limits for the pulsed emission",
    "we assume that the pulse profile is the same as that seen by egret at lower energies with emission concentrated in a main pulse in the phase range 0.94 - 0.04 and a secondary pulse in the range 0.32 - 0.43 @xcite .",
    "we use the method of helene to determine an upper limit of @xmath155 pulsed events at the 99% confidence level @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to 12% of the observed steady signal .",
    "we include the detector acceptance as follows .",

    "we note that our limit is not directly comparable to that obtained by the stacee @xcite group since they used the larger acceptance corresponding to their measured steady spectrum for comparison with the prediction of tev pulsed emission .",
    "our hypothesis of an attenuated egret spectrum restricts our acceptance to the low energy range of fig.[ethresh ] , yet our upper limit still provides the most constraining measurement so far on the position of the cutoff point . in the future , improved trigger electronics and observing and analysis strategies optimized for pulsar observations should allow us to increase our acceptance at low energy .",
    "the radiation from the crab nebula is dominated by non - thermal emission which is believed to be generated by synchrotron radiation from highly relativistic electrons with energies up to @xmath164 .",
    "the electrons are accelerated at the shock front where a relativistic wind of charged particles emerging from the pulsar meets the surrounding nebula @xcite .",
    "recent high resolution x - ray observations by the chandra observatory have shown an inner ring of x - ray emission which may correspond to the position of this shock @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have described the electrons in terms of two populations of different energies .",
    "the first , generated over the whole lifetime of the nebula and covering energies up to @xmath22 , produces synchrotron radiation from radio wavelengths to the far infra - red while the second , more recently accelerated population , with energies @xmath165 produces synchrotron emission from the infra - red up to @xmath1131 gev .",
    "it was first suggested by @xcite ( also @xcite and @xcite ) that the synchrotron self - compton mechanism could give rise to radiation from the crab above @xmath15 .",
    "this process , in which inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photons by the relativistic electrons boosts the photons up to much higher energies , has been modelled by various workers , most recently @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the synchrotron photons are the most important component , photons due to infra - red emission from dust and to the microwave background will also be upscattered and contribute significantly to the high energy emission .",
    "[ spectrum ] shows the result of this work along with the measurements from egret and three atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescopes .",
    "the shape of the inverse compton spectrum is relatively insensitive to the model parameters , but the absolute flux depends strongly upon the magnetic field strength in the emitting region , which in turn depends upon @xmath166 , the ratio of the magnetic field strength to particle energy density in the pulsar wind .",
    "@xcite have proposed that an additional component due to bremsstrahlung radiation from the relativistic electrons in dense filaments of nebular gas may provide an increased flux in the @xmath167 range , which could account for a possible discrepancy between the models and the egret points around @xmath15 .",
    "the uncertainties are still large but the celeste measurement does not seem to point towards such an effect .",
    "the calibration of such a complex instrument as celeste is a large project in itself .",
    "our measurement errors are currently dominated by systematic effects which should decrease as this work proceeds , the most important being to improve our determination of the energy scale .",
    "the crab pulsar is a source of 33 pulsed radiation from radio wavelengths to gev gamma ray energies .",
    "periodic emission is observed by egret up to energies of @xmath12 @xcite . despite early claims @xcite",
    ", no pulsed emission has been detected by the present generation of ground based atmospheric erenkov experiments .",
    "the previous best upper limits are at @xmath8 , from the whipple @xcite and cat @xcite groups , and the limit at @xmath168 by stacee @xcite .",
    "two general classes of models have been proposed to describe the pulsed gamma ray emission from the high energy pulsars observed by egret . in the polar cap models @xcite electrons accelerated from the neutron star surface at the magnetic pole emit by curvature radiation or magnetic inverse compton scattering , triggering photon - pair cascades in the pulsar magnetosphere from which the observed radiation emerges .",
    "outer gap @xcite models place the emission region in the outer magnetosphere where electrons are accelerated across charge depleted regions near the light cylinder .",
    "both models predict a cutoff in the pulsed emission below @xmath2 , and the exact position for the cutoff can be used to discriminate between them .",
    "@xcite treat the electrodynamics of the outer gap from first principles .",
    "the free parameter in their model is the current density at the gap boundaries , which in turn depends on the distance of the gap from the light cylinder .",
    "our upper limit excludes the hypothesis that the current density vanishes at the gap surface , since the model predicts a gamma ray flux extending to 60 gev in that case .",
    "[ pulsedspec ] includes the prediction of their model for the case of a small current density at the inner boundary , and a null current at the outer boundary .",
    "[ pulsedspec ] also shows the predictions of a polar cap model , along with the egret measurements and higher energy upper limits .",
    "the celeste upper limit constrains the high energy emission more strongly than the previous whipple measurement , but increased sensitivity at lower energy is still needed to favor a particular model for the emission processes .",
    "we have presented the first detection by the atmospheric erenkov technique of a gamma ray source , the crab nebula , at energies below 100 using the celeste experiment .",
    "the measured flux is compatible with most emission models .",
    "no periodic signal has been detected but our upper limit allows us to constrain further the cutoff point for emission from the pulsar . as our uncertainties decrease we will be able to determine the energy range in which the nebula and pulsar contributions are comparable .    the data reported on in this paper were collected during the first observation season with a fully operational 40 heliostat array . in single pointing mode",
    "we now have a sensitivity to the crab of @xmath169 . a smaller dataset obtained with heliostat",
    "double pointing appears to confirm monte carlo predictions of improved sensitivity , yielding @xmath111 , although more data is required for confirmation .",
