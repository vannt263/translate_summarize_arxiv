    "the rich variety of conformations which leads to many different intrinsic properties of polymer solutions has continuously drawn considerable interest in soft matter research .",
    "computer modeling is increasingly being used as an integral part of theoretical study , in order to both test existing theories and to trigger the development of new concepts .",
    "furthermore , computer simulations have also become an essential tool in materials research , especially for predicting and understanding the behavior of complex systems , where a complete theory is not available .",
    "it has been proven to be an effective and inexpensive way to study these systems . in order to observe large - scale properties , it is crucial to reduce the computational cost by coarse - graining the details of the atomic structure",
    ". this is particularly true for polymer systems and studies of their universal static and dynamic properties @xcite . in this context , using a conventional bead - spring chain model to represent a polymer molecule in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations is usually sufficient . in the case of dilute and semidilute polymer solutions",
    ", a correct model also needs to take into account the effect of solvent molecules .",
    "this effect is two - fold : on the one hand , the good solvent quality results in swelling of the random coil ; on the other , the solvent - mediated long - range dynamic correlations between different segments of the chain , known as hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) , significantly influence the dynamical behavior @xcite . in the present methodological study , we focus on the dilute regime which is theoretically most thoroughly understood .    in order to capture hydrodynamic interactions in md simulations ,",
    "the solvent particles need to be incorporated explicitly . typically , the number of solvent particles required for such a model is of the order of thousands even for a short chain .",
    "although such studies are feasible @xcite , they are rather inefficient , for this reason .",
    "therefore , a more coarse - grained description of the solvent is highly desirable .",
    "two complementary approaches have been developed to do this .",
    "`` mesoscopic '' methods keep the solvent degrees of freedom , but describe them in a simplified fashion .",
    "these include dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) , multi  particle collision dynamics ( mpcd ) @xcite , and lattice boltzmann ( lb ) .",
    "these approaches are typically one to two orders of magnitude faster than md @xcite .",
    "conversely , brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations remove the solvent degrees of freedom completely , and take their effect into account via non - trivial long - range dynamic correlations in the stochastic displacements .",
    "this is possible due to the time scale separation between the fast solvent motion and the slow conformational polymer degrees of freedom .",
    "since the number of degrees of freedom is reduced drastically , the method has the potential to save cpu time by additional several orders of magnitude , in particular in the dilute limit .",
    "however , a simple implementation of the correlations @xcite leads to an algorithm which scales like @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of brownian particles , and therefore becomes infeasible as soon as @xmath4 exceeds a few hundred @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to treat hi by means of fixman s algorithm @xcite ( scaling roughly as @xmath5 ) , which we do in the present study .",
    "the recently introduced method by geyer and winter @xcite would reduce the necessary cpu effort by roughly one additional order of magnitude for typical chain lengths , and exhibit a more favorable scaling ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , it is based upon an inexact approximation of the hydrodynamic correlations that can not be improved systematically ( in contrast to fixman s method ) . for this reason ,",
    "this algorithm was not implemented .",
    "none of these approaches is sufficient to reach @xmath7 ; this latter goal is only attainable by the implementation of very recent `` superfast '' bd algorithms based upon fast fourier transforms .",
    "these latter algorithms scale as @xmath8 , where the exponent @xmath9 depends on the details of the underlying physics , and is usually substantially smaller than unity .",
    "these methods require the study of a confined system , and hence are not used in the present study .    while the advantages and disadvantages of the methods are well - known in general terms ( and have resulted in differing methodological preferences in different groups of researchers ) , not much is known _ quantitatively _ in terms of a clear comparison of computational efficiency .",
    "the present paper aims at partly filling this gap .",
    "recently , one of the present authors @xcite has proposed a new mesoscopic method for simulating polymer - solvent systems .",
    "the solvent is represented by a fluid on a grid , simulated via the lattice boltzmann approach , while the motion of the polymer chain is governed by a continuous md model .",
    "the two parts are coupled by a simple dissipative force .",
    "the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method was originally developed to simulate hydrodynamics on a grid @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the lb method is a fast and effective method for simulating fluid flows , which has the same speed and accuracy as other navier - stokes solvers @xcite .",
    "ladd @xcite successfully applied the lb method to colloidal systems ( originally with a _ conservative _ coupling ) and showed that the cpu cost scales linearly with the number of particles .",
    "moreover , he showed how fluctuations can be incorporated into the lb model , which is essential in order to investigate brownian motion @xcite .",
    "this procedure has recently been refined and improved @xcite .",
    "the dissipative coupling method @xcite was thoroughly tested by applying it to a single polymer chain in solution , for which the data of a previous md simulation @xcite were available , and whose parameters were used as an input for the mesoscopic model .    in this work , we study the dynamics of a single chain in a solvent to compare the predictions of the explicit solvent model via the lb method with the predictions of the implicit solvent model by bd simulations .",
    "many recent simulation studies have investigated very similar systems , using various mesoscopic solvent models like mpcd @xcite , dpd @xcite , direct solution of the navier - stokes equation @xcite , and smoothed dpd @xcite .",
    "these studies were mainly done in order to test and verify the validity of the chosen mesoscopic simulation approach .",
    "meanwhile it is fair to say that a single chain in solution is a standard benchmark test bed for mesoscopic simulation methods , the necessary condition for passing being the correct reproduction of the zimm scaling laws within the limitations of finite chain length and finite solvent volume .",
    "the present study , however , aims directly at a _ quantititave comparison _ between two different methods , and therefore it is crucial that that the underlying polymer model is exactly identical for both methods .",
    "this is the reason why the data of refs .",
    "@xcite , though all exhibiting essentially the same physics , are of no direct relevance for the present investigation , since all of them employ slightly different polymer models , and simulate solvents with somewhat different viscosities .",
    "one very recent study by ladd et al .",
    "@xcite has done a rather similar comparison between lb and bd , and arrived at similar conclusions ; the present paper should be viewed as a complementary study that puts some more emphasis on the issue of computational efficiency .    after introducing the models ,",
    "we show how to map the input parameters of the hybrid model onto the input values of the bd model to directly compare the predicted quantities ( sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] then confirms the expected physical equivalence of the two approaches in terms of comparing static and dynamic data .",
    "furthermore , this section also presents our comparison on the numerical cost or benchmark data for both methods . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the results and give our conclusions .",
    "in this work , a polymer molecule is represented by a conventional bead - spring chain model , which consists of @xmath4 beads that are connected via @xmath10 finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) massless springs .",
    "the lennard - jones potential , which acts between all monomers , is used to model the excluded volume ( ev ) effect .",

    "the evolution of the lb variables @xmath19 is governed by the following lattice boltzmann equation @xcite : @xmath20 the variable @xmath21 is the ( partial ) fluid mass density at grid site @xmath22 at time @xmath23 , corresponding to the discrete velocity @xmath24 .",

    "@xcite only considered the thermalization of modes related to the viscous stress tensor .",
    "it is important to note that even though this procedure is correct in the hydrodynamic limit , it provides poor thermalization on smaller length scales @xcite .",
    "adhikari et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that by applying thermalization to all nonconserved modes one gets a significantly improved numerical behavior at short scales ; the theoretical background is now thoroughly understood @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have also investigated the effects of thermalization of the kinetic modes on various dynamic properties .",
    "the coupling to the beads is done via simple interpolation of the flow velocity from the surrounding sites , and by introducing a phenomenological stokes friction coefficient @xmath46 of the beads .",
    "this gives rise to a friction force on the particles , plus a langevin force that balances the frictional losses .",

    "the diffusion tensor is given by @xmath67 further details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the computationally most intensive part is to determine the matrix @xmath61 .",
    "generally , cholesky decomposition of @xmath53 is used to obtain @xmath61 as an upper ( or lower ) triangular matrix , and the computational cost for this method scales as @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "fixman made use of the fact that there are many possibilities to define @xmath61 as some square - root matrix of @xmath53 , and , noting that it is the vector @xmath69 that is required rather than the matrix @xmath61 , applied a truncated chebyshev polynomial expansion to obtain @xmath69 with a lower computational cost , scaling roughly as @xmath70 @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we make use of this accelerated technique as well .      for implementation on a computer , physical quantities must be represented in certain units , i.  e. in terms of suitable dimensionless ratios .",
    "this is typically done by choosing a natural unit system where three independent elementary quantities are set to unity .    in the coupled md / lb simulation approach , this is usually done by choosing the lennard - jones parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the mass of the monomer ) as the units of energy , length , and time , respectively ; this choice enables one to make direct contact with md simulations with explicit solvent @xcite .",
    "conversely , bd simulations have traditionally @xcite used a unit system where one chooses @xmath74 as the energy unit and @xmath75 as the length unit .",
    "this is particularly useful for the simulation of pure gaussian ( harmonic ) chains where the interaction potential has neither an energy scale nor a length scale built in .",
    "the time unit in bd simulations is usually chosen as @xmath76 .",
    "of course , a meaningful comparison of results requires that all data are represented in one common unit system . at this point",
    ", one realizes that this is less straightforward than one might think at first glance . while the conversion of length and energy units is trivial , and directly facilitated by the fact that both methods use the same molecular model for the polymer chain , and perform the simulations at the same temperature , the conversion of time units is not .",
    "this is so because of the different time scales underlying the basic updating algorithms : the md / lb method is based upon simulating the system on _ inertial _ time scales , while bd focuses directly on the larger _ diffusive _ time scales .",
    "this is directly reflected by the occurence of the intertial parameter @xmath73 ( monomer mass ) in the md / lb time unit , which does occur in the bd model , and the diffusive parameter @xmath77 ( monomer friction constant ) in the bd time unit .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath77 is _ not _ an input parameter to the md / lb model .",
    "rather , one needs to carefully distinguish between the short - time friction coefficient @xmath46 that is indeed an input parameter  it describes the stokes coupling of the monomer to the lb fluid in its immediate vicinity  and the long - time friction coefficient @xmath78 describing the particle s long - time response that is modified by solvent backflow effects .",
    "it is this latter parameter that must be identified with the bd @xmath77 , and it is esentially an _ output _ parameter .",
    "fortunately , the relation between @xmath46 and @xmath78 is well understood  ahlrichs and dnweg @xcite have shown that @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a numerical prefactor and @xmath26 is some measure for the range of interpolation to the surrounding lattice sites . for linear interpolation to the nearest sites",
    ", one finds @xmath81 , if @xmath26 is the lb lattice spacing . for highly accurate results",
    ", one should also take into account a small correction for the finite size of the simulation box @xcite ; this has however not been done in the present paper .",
    "rather , we took the mapping determined in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate @xmath78 from @xmath46 and identified this with the @xmath77 parameter of the bd calculations . although the physical mapping done in this way is essentially correct , it is important to notice that this aspect introduces a certain amount of numerical inaccuracy when it comes to quantitative comparisons .",
    "given the fact that it is intrinsically impossible to run the two simulations with the same unit system , we chose to keep the previously established systems of the two respective methods , and to map the results _ a posteriori _ by the procedure outlined above . furthermore , we chose to present all results in md / lb units .",
    "technically , this means that for length and time unit conversions we need to set @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the `` * '' superscript denotes bd non - dimensionalization , while `` - '' denotes a non - dimensionalization for md / lb . the corresponding factors for the conversion from bd to md / lb units are then trivially found to be @xmath84 note that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are @xmath15 and @xmath87 in non - dimensional md / lb units , respectively , while the ratio @xmath88 is just the non - dimensionalized temperature in md / lb units .",
    "the dimensionless hydrodynamic interaction parameter @xmath89 used in the bd simulations is essentially a non - dimensionalized stokes radius .",
    "we thus find @xmath90 or @xmath91 we therefore parameterized our simulations by first picking simulation parameters for the md / lb model ( which were then directly used for md / lb ) , then converting these to bd units using the procedure outlined above , and then running the thus - obtained equivalent bd model . for these latter simulations , a time step size @xmath92 ( in bd units )",
    "was found to produce sufficiently accurate results .",
    "the physical input values for the present model are chosen from the benchmark values developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which have been shown to reproduce the results of a typical pure md simulation @xcite . as in the comparison between lb and md simulations ,",
    "we study a system of a single polymer chain of length @xmath93 monomers immersed in a fluid with temperature @xmath94 , density @xmath95 , and kinematic viscosity @xmath96 .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath97 is set to unity , which is roughly identical to the bond length ; this is necessary to resolve the hydrodynamic interactions on small length scales with sufficient accuracy .",
    "furthermore , following ref .",
    "@xcite , the coupling parameter @xmath98 was set to @xmath99 .",
    "the values of the fene spring potential parameters are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the time step size for the polymer ( the md part of the simulations ) is set to @xmath102 .",
    "it should be noted that such a large time step is possible since the inclusion of dissipation and noise lead to a substantial stabilization , compared to purely microcanonical md .",
    "the value of the time step that updates the fluid should be chosen in a way such that the lb variables @xmath19 do not become negative too often . here ,",
    "we choose @xmath103 , where such a case rarely occurred during the observation time .",
    "it is important to mention another free input parameter which governs the time scale for the evolution of hydrodynamic interactions , known as the schmidt number @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the diffusion constant of the single monomer .",
    "this parameter can be set arbitrarily in the lb method by choosing @xmath106 and @xmath105 ( which can be tuned by choosing @xmath107 ) accordingly .",
    "ideally , the value of @xmath108 should be chosen such that hydrodynamic interaction evolves much faster than the diffusion of a monomer . in our case",
    ", we have @xmath109 , which has been shown to result in zimm - like behavior @xcite .    for the lb simulations , the polymer chain moves within a cubic box of length @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions , while it is drifting freely in an infinite medium for the bd simulations .",
    "in order to accurately compare various properties between the two systems , one must understand the effects of the box length @xmath0 on any observable of interest in the lb simulations .",
    "thus it is essential to only compare quantities under identical conditions ( i.  e. independent of the box length ) .",
    "hence various box lengths @xmath0 ranging from 10 to 35 lennard - jones units were investigated ; this allows us to extrapolate to the @xmath2 limit .",
    "the mean square radius of gyration and the mean square end - to - end distance are given by @xmath110 with @xmath111 being the inter - particle distance .",
    "these two quantities are both related to the number of monomers by the expression @xmath112 where @xmath106 is the flory exponent . for a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) ,",
    "the flory exponent @xmath106 is 0.588 @xcite . in principle",
    ", @xmath106 can be obtained from simulations , using the scaling law in eq .",
    "[ eq : flory ] .",
    "however , this method would require simulations for a wide range of @xmath4 values .",
    "alternatively , one can use the static structure factor @xmath113 to obtain @xmath106 much more efficiently .    in the scaling regime @xmath114",
    "( @xmath115 being a microscopic length of the order of the bond length ) , a power law relation between the static structure factor and the wave vector @xmath116 holds : @xmath117    figure  [ fig : skstat ] shows the static structure factor as a function of wave vector @xmath116 for the lb simulations with the presence of thermalization of all modes , and the bd simulations .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the values of the static structure factor obtained from the lb simulations are exactly the same as those obtained from the bd simulations , indicating that they have the same static conformations . from eq .",
    "[ eq : svsk ] , the value of @xmath106 can be extracted from the linear region of the log - log plot of @xmath118 vs @xmath116 .",
    "as expected , the values for @xmath106 obtained via this method are the same for both the lb and the bd simulations , as reported in table  [ tab : props ] . however , they are approximately 5% higher than the asymptotically correct value , which is a consequence of the finite chain length .",
    "the results for the mean square radius of gyration and the mean square end - to - end distance in table  [ tab : props ] further confirm this agreement with regard to static conformations between the two methods .",
    "however , at small box length ( @xmath119 ) , the results for these static properties for the lb method deviate from their asymptotic values .",
    "the discrepancy observed here always arises when the box length is too small compared to the chain size , where the chain is more likely to wrap over itself due to spatial restriction and hence alter its static conformations .",
    "we also found that the two versions of lb thermalization ( `` stresses  only '' vs `` full '' thermalization ) yield identical results for the chain conformational statistics .",
    "in general , we only quote values obtained for full thermalization , unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the hydrodynamic radius for a single chain in an infinite medium is given by @xmath120    for a chain in a finite box , as is the case here in the lb method , it has been shown that the hydrodynamic interactions of the chain with its periodic images effectively increases @xmath121 @xcite . in order to account for this finite - size effect , a finite - size correction of order @xmath1 for most dynamic properties , resulting from the slow @xmath122 decay of hydrodynamic interactions ,",
    "is required @xcite .",
    "the results for the infinite - box value @xmath123 agree excellently with each other for all simulations ( see table  [ tab : props ] ) .",
    "since the overwrapping effect is more sensitive to large inter - particle distances , it turns out that the deviation in the inverse hydrodynamic radius is too small , for the range of box lengths used , for it to be distinguishable .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : props ] , the deviation is more pronounced for the radius of gyration , and even more for the end - to - end distance .      according to dynamic scaling , the longest relaxation time @xmath124 of the chain is , by order of magnitude , identical to the time that the chain needs to move its own size , i.  e. @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the diffusion constant of the chain s center of mass .",
    "this leads to a dynamic scaling law @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the dynamic scaling exponent . for a chain with hydrodynamic interactions , this relaxation time",

    "these quantities will be referred to in the discussion below .",
    "the mean - square displacement of the chain s center of mass @xmath134 for both methods is depicted in fig .",

    "moreover , they seem to converge to the value predicted by the bd simulations ( @xmath136 ) in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "effects of thermalization of the kinetic modes in lb simulations on this property will be discussed subsequently .",
    "the chain s center of mass diffusion constant @xmath126 can be determined by the slope of the @xmath135 vs @xmath23 curve , where the relationship @xmath137 holds . by fitting a power law to the simulation data",
    ", we obtain the exponents and the diffusion constants shown in table  [ tab : props ] .",
    "these exponents support the prediction of simple diffusive behavior ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "theoretically , one would expect that two diffusive regimes exist : on the one hand , there should be a short - time diffusive regime , corresponding to time scales well below the zimm time , @xmath139 , but also well above the ballistic regime , @xmath140 ; note that @xmath141 only in the lb case , since the bd equation of motion is overdamped . on the other hand , there should be free diffusion for times @xmath142 .",
    "both these regimes exhibit @xmath138 behavior , but with different prefactors , with a smooth crossover around the zimm time @xcite . in principle",
    "these two different diffusion constants can be obtained via fits to the corresponding regimes . in practice , however , it turns out that the values are very close to each other , and hence the crossover is very smooth @xcite .",
    "therefore its unambiguous identification is very difficult , i.  e. impossible within the resolution of our data .",
    "the mean - square displacement of a single monomer @xmath30 is given by @xmath143 here , only the two innermost monomers near the center of the chain are evaluated to eliminate end effects ; the results are plotted in fig .",

    "this result also holds for lb simulations without full thermalization .",
    "this shows that the global center - of - mass motion of the chain is actually the primary contribution to the deviations between lb and bd results . in the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] this contribution is suppressed : in terms of rouse modes , only the internal modes remain . for these modes , however , it has been shown @xcite that the hi with the periodic images is much weaker , while the leading - order @xmath122 hi cancels out .",

    "[ fig : g2 ] .",
    "theoretically , these data can also be used for estimating the zimm time as the time where the crossover to the long - time plateau occurs . however , the crossover is quite extended and smooth , making it difficult to extract .",
    "we therefore estimated the zimm time via @xmath155 strictly speaking , this definition is only valid for a single chain in an infinite medium , where there is no finite box size effect . in the presence of finite box size",

    "it is worth mentioning that the bd value of @xmath157 can be obtained from the mean square displacement of the chain center of mass or via fixman s expression @xcite .",
    "the latter method has been shown to produce a much more reliable result and is easier to carry out @xcite .",
    "the value reported here has been cross checked by both methods and the results are almost the same within error bars . for the lb simulations without thermalization of the kinetic modes , the value of @xmath157 at the asymptotic limit @xmath158 is different from that predicted by the bd simulations by about @xmath159 .",
    "however , when all the kinetic modes in the lb simulations have been thermalized , the deviation in @xmath126 reduces to @xmath160 .",
    "this result clearly indicates that it is very important to thermalize all the kinetic modes in order to obtain correct values for dynamic properties .",
    "the reason for the remaining small discrepancy between lb and bd is not completely clear , since there are numerous possible sources .",
    "firstly , it should be noted that the underlying equations of motion are quite different : lb works with inertia , while bd employs overdamped dynamics .",
    "this results in different schmidt numbers @xmath108 and different mach numbers @xmath161 , the latter being defined as the ratio of the flow velocity to the speed of sound : both are finite in the lb method , while in the bd case they are strictly infinite ( @xmath108 ) and zero ( @xmath161 ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the hi function at small interparticle distances is somewhat different for the two methods : in the bd case , we employ the rpy tensor , while the nearest - neighbor interpolation for lb results in a short - range hi that differs somewhat from the rpy tensor ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the value of the constant @xmath80 in eq .",
    "[ eq : zeta_eff_vs_zeta_bare ] , which is crucial for the mapping between the lb friction parameter @xmath46 and the bd friction @xmath78 , is only known with some numerical inaccuracy . for highly accurate mappings ,",

    "within the approximation of the zimm model , the autocorrelation function of the modes should decay exponentially @xcite @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the relaxation of the @xmath166-th mode . to validate our rouse mode analysis routine ,",
    "we have carried out extensive simulations for a ( gaussian ) rouse chain of @xmath167 in the absence of hi and ev ; the results for @xmath165 are in excellent agreement with the analytical predictions @xcite .",

    "this deviation systematically becomes smaller upon increasing the mode index @xmath166 . since high mode index means essentially relaxation on a rather small length scale ,",
    "it is tempting to attribute the deviation to the finite propagation of hi in the lb model , i.  e. to retardation effects , or effects of finite schmidt number , which are more important on large length scales than on small ones . nevertheless , this hypothesis is not proven .    in ref .",

    "for bd , we take the cpu time needed to observe the system for the same time span in physical units .",
    "each of the simulations performed for the cpu time comparison was run on an itanium 2 processor of a 1.6 ghz sgi altix server 3700 .",
    "all the parameters used to carry out this comparison are the optimal values for both methods .",
    "several chain sizes ranging from @xmath191 to @xmath192 have been used to obtain the cpu cost for comparison .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpu ] . for the lb method ,",
    "it is clear that the cpu cost scales linearly with the number of particles , i.  e. the number of grid points that the solvent lives on , or @xmath193 .",
    "since the ratio @xmath194 is kept constant , or @xmath195 , this leads to a cpu cost scaling as @xmath196 .",
    "this is indeed found in our benchmarks , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cpu ] .",
    "similarly , our data also confirm the predicted @xmath70 cpu cost scaling for bd .",
    "though the lb exponent is lower than bd , the large prefactor ensures that the total cpu cost for lb is much more expensive compared to bd for the typical chain lengths used in the literature .",
    "it is only when the chain length is excessively large ( i.  e. @xmath4 of the order of @xmath197 or higher ) that lb will become superior to bd for a single - chain system .",
    "the situation completely changes if one studies a semi - dilute solution instead , as has been done in ref .",
    "for such a system , we have not done a comparison between lb and bd in terms of actual simulations ; however , by means of scaling considerations one can roughly estimate what the likely result of such a comparison would be .",
    "a semidilute solution comprises @xmath198 chains of @xmath4 monomers each , such that the total number of monomers is @xmath199 .",
    "therefore the bd cpu cost scales as @xmath200 , while the lb cpu cost depends on the density . within the blob picture of semidilute solutions ,",
    "one views a chain as a sequence of `` blobs '' , each comprising @xmath201 monomers , and having size @xmath202 , which can be viewed as the typical correlation length of density fluctuations , or the typical distance from which point on chain - chain interactions become important .",
    "since the conformation statistics within the blob is that of a self - avoiding walk , one has @xmath203 , where @xmath26 is the monomer size .",
    "the sequence of blobs forms a random walk , hence @xmath204 .",
    "this gives the minimum size of the simulation box , i.  e. @xmath205 , or @xmath206 .",
    "we thus see that the cpu effort for the lb method is even slightly _ decreased _ by the factor @xmath207 compared to the single - chain case at the same @xmath4 , due to the shrinkage of the chains resulting from excluded - volume screening . in order to estimate the number of chains @xmath198",
    ", we note that the arrangement of blobs is space - filling , i.  e. @xmath208 .",
    "comparing this with the previous expression for @xmath193 , one finds @xmath209 .",
    "therefore the bd effort , compared to the single - chain case , is increased by a factor of @xmath210 . taken together , this means that the ratio between lb effort and bd effort is changed by a factor of @xmath211 in favor of lb . for @xmath212 , which is needed as a minimum to resolve the gaussian statistics of the chains as a whole ,",
    "one obtains a factor of @xmath213 , which more or less compensates the two orders of magnitude seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpu ] .",
    "taking into account that for such a system the bd simulation would have to calculate the hi with the periodic images , e.  g. , via ewald sums , which is much more complicated than the present single - chain simulation , one sees that for a semidilute solution clearly lb is more efficient , unless a `` superfast '' bd algorithm @xcite is used . for the latter case ,",
    "the answer is not yet known .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that lb / md may be favorable for a rather small number of monomers ; however , this study was done ( i ) in a non - trivial geometry , which implies a more complicated bd method , and ( ii ) under complete neglect of thermal fluctuations in the lb simulations , resulting in a substantial reduction in cpu effort .",
    "such a ( partial or complete ) neglect of thermal noise is sometimes justified in strong nonequilibrium situations such as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in that particular case , the justification was checked by additional tests @xcite .",
    "another possible situation where lb noise is negligible is the case of strong coarse - graining , where a single lattice site can already be considered as a macroscopic thermodynamic system ( for a detailed discussion , see ref .",

    "those results that are not affected by @xmath1 finite size effects , such as the mean square displacement in the center of mass system , or the rouse mode autocorrelation function , agree very favorably with each other . for highly dilute systems where the simulation of a single chain is sufficient , bd is usually the method of choice , as it is much more efficient than the coupled lb / md approach , and finite box size effects are absent .",
    "the situation changes however in the semidilute case , where it is easy to estimate that bd will not be able to compete , unless `` superfast '' algorithms are used .",
