    "the beam of particles and the photon flux move in vacuum whereas in the proposed scheme they propagate through a crystalline media .",
    "therefore , to prove that the crystalline undulator is feasible , it is necessary to analyze the influence of the interaction of both beams with the crystal constituents . on the basis of such analysis",

    "this analysis was carried out very recently and the feasibility of the crystalline undulator was demonstrated in an adequate form for the first time in refs .   and in refs .  .",
    "for further referencing let us briefly mention the conditions which must be met in a crystalline undulator .",
    "a stable planar channeling of an ultra - relativistic positron in a periodically bent crystal occurs if the maximum centrifugal force , @xmath19 , is less than the maximal force due to the interplanar field , @xmath20 . notating the ratio @xmath21 as @xmath22 one formulates this condition as follows @xcite : @xmath23    there are two essentially different regimes of the radiation formation in a periodically bent crystals",
    "they are defined by the magnitude of the ratio @xmath24 . in the case of low amplitudes , @xmath25 ,",
    "the characteristic frequencies of the channeling radiation and the undulator radiation become compatible @xmath26 .",
    "this results in the loss of the monochromaticity of the radiation , since the channeling radiation is essentially non - monochromatic due to noticeable deviations of the interplanar potential from a harmonic form .",
    "additionally , in this case the intensity of undulator radiation is small compared with that of the channeling radiation @xcite .    on the contrary , in the limit",
    "@xmath27 not only the characteristic frequencies are well separated , @xmath28 , but also the undulator radiation intensity is higher than the intensity of the channeling radiation @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if one is only interested in the spectral distribution of the undulator radiation , one may disregard the channeling oscillations and assume that the projectile moves along the centerline of the bent channel .",
    "therefore , the criterion which is imposed on the relative magnitudes of @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 is as follows @xmath29 the second inequality ensures that the crystal is deformed elastically , and its structure and symmetry are not affected by the deformation .",
    "the term undulator implies that the number of undulator periods , @xmath30 , is large . only in this limit",
    "does the radiation formed during the passage of a bunch of relativistic particles through a periodic system bear the features of undulator radiation ( narrow , well - separated peaks in spectral - angular distribution ) rather than those of synchrotron radiation .",
    "hence , the following strong inequality , which entangles the period @xmath1 and the length of a crystal @xmath17 must be met in the crystalline undulator @xcite : @xmath31    the coherence of the radiation , emitted in the crystalline undulator , takes place if the energy of the channeling particle does not change noticeably during with the penetration distance . for ultra - relativistic projectiles the main source of energy losses are the radiative losses .",
    "therefore , it is important to establish the range of energies for which the parameters of undulator radiation formed in a perfect periodic crystalline structure are stable . in ref .",
    "a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the radiative loss of energy , @xmath32 , due to the channeling and the undulator radiation was carried out .",
    "it was established that the relative radiative losses @xmath33 become large if the initial energy of the positron bunch is @xmath34 gev . for lower energies of positrons @xmath35 the radiative losses are small , @xmath36 .    as was pointed out refs .",
    "two phenomena , the dechanneling effect and the photon attenuation , lead to severe limitation on the length of a crystalline undulator .",
    "if the dechanneling effect is neglected , one may unrestrictedly increase the intensity of the undulator radiation by considering larger @xmath30-values .",
    "in reality , random scattering of the channeling particle by the electrons and nuclei of the crystal leads to a gradual increase of the particle energy associated with the transverse oscillations in the channel . as a result ,",
    "the transverse energy at some distance from the entrance point exceeds the depth of the interplanar potential well , and the particle leaves the channel . the mean penetration distance covered by a channeling particle",
    "is called the dechanneling length . for given crystal and projectile the dechanneling length @xmath37 depends on the energy @xmath8 and on the parameter @xmath22 ( see ( [ condition.1 ] ) ) . to calculate the dechanneling length",
    "one can either apply the diffusion theory to describe the multiple scattering @xcite or carry out a computer simulation of the scattering process of the projectile from the crystal constituents @xcite .",
    "alternatively , to estimate @xmath38 one can use the approximate formulae @xcite . for an ultra - relativistic positron",
    "the dechanneling length in straight channels ( i.e. @xmath39 ) in various crystals lies within the interval @xmath40 @xcite , i.e. does not exceed several millimeters at gev energies of a positron .",
    "for a periodically bent channel the dechanneling length decreases as @xmath22 grows following , approximately , the law @xmath41 @xcite .    the propagation of photons emitted in a crystalline undulator is strongly influenced by the atomic and the nuclear photoeffects , the coherent and incoherent scattering on electrons and nuclei , the electron - positron pair production .",
    "all these processes lead to the decrease in the intensity of the photon flux as it propagates through the crystal . a quantitative parameter , which accounts for all these effects and defines the scale within which the intensity of a photon flux decreases by a factor of @xmath42 , is called the attenuation length , @xmath43 .",
    "it is related to the mass attenuation coefficient @xmath44 as @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath44 are tabulated for all elements and for a wide range of photon frequencies @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath46 depends on @xmath47 and on the type of the constituent atoms .",
    "for low-@xmath48 crystals ( e.g. , diamond ) the magnitude of @xmath46 exceeds that for a tungsten crystal taken for the same @xmath47 by a factor of @xmath49 . in the case of a diamond crystal",
    "the value of @xmath46 varies from @xmath50 cm at @xmath51 kev up to several cm for @xmath52 ev .",
    "the simplest way to account for the dechanneling and the attenuation is to consider the case when the crystal length satisfies the condition @xmath53 $ ] , and to assume that within the chosen @xmath17 scale neither the number of channeled particles nor the flux of emitted photons do decrease .",
    "such approach was utilized in most of the papers devoted to the crystalline undulator problem .",
    "more consistent treatment of the dechanneling process and of its influence on the parameters of the undulator radiation was carried out in refs .  , where a simple analytic expression for the spectral - angular distribution was derived which contains , as a parameter , the dechanneling length .    in the present work",

    "the factor @xmath199 ( see ( [ numberphotonscollection.1 ] ) ) depends on the harmonic number @xmath69 and on the undulator parameter @xmath13 which , in turn , is defined by the values of @xmath8 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 through the relation @xmath200 . the second factor , @xmath179 depends on @xmath17 , @xmath1 , @xmath37 and @xmath201 .",

    "this uncertainty is not intrinsic to the case of a periodically bent crystal but rather reflects the stochastic nature of the interaction of a channeling particle with crystal constituents . as mentioned above to calculate the dechanneling length one can apply the diffusion theory to describe the multiple scattering or carry out numerical simulations of the scattering process .",

    "larger values of @xmath1 results in lowering of the emitted photon energy ( see eq .",
    "( [ centralline.1 ] ) and the graphs ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ s_si_ge_w.eps.fig ] ) and , consequently , to the decrease of the attenuation length , @xmath46 .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the increase of the ratio @xmath196 which defines the magnitude of @xmath228 .",
    "this factor , as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ optimalundnom.eps.fig ] , rapidly falls off for @xmath231 , and this feature manifests itself in the dependence of @xmath215 on @xmath24 . in the case of crystals consisting of heavy atoms the dependence acquires additional features , which are due to the fact that the ionization potentials , @xmath232 , of the inner atomic subshells of such atoms lie within the energy range @xmath233 kev .",
    "the photons with the energy just above the threshold are absorbed much more efficiently than those with the lower energies . as a result ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath46 in the vicinity of the threshold becomes a saw - like . for @xmath234 the attenuation length noticeably ( up to the order of magnitude ) exceeds @xmath46 for @xmath235 .",
    "this effect results in the irregularities of the dependence @xmath215 on @xmath24 , which in figs .",
    "[ optimalundnom.eps.fig ] are mostly pronounced for diamond and tungsten crystals .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath25 the number of the emitted photons goes to zero .",
    "this tendency , which is seen explicitly for all the curves ( but the cers - c one ) in the case of c and si crystals , is also clear and is due to the fact that the case @xmath236 corresponds to the linear crystal , i.e. the absence of the crystalline undulator .    in fig .",

    "it is seen that in contrast to the number of the emitted photons which is the same , by the order of magnitude , for all colliders , the magnitudes of the peak brilliance for different beams differ by orders of magnitude . to the largest extent",

    "[ bril_c_si_ge_w.eps.fig ] ) . as a result , this beam , which does not lead to the highest values of @xmath215 , ensures the largest peak brilliance of the crystalline undulator radiation .",
