    "during the last decades we have witnessed a rapid development of methods of geometrical quantization .",
    "it was triggered by the discovery of the integration measure over two - dimensional geometries which was applied in calculations of quantum amplitudes in string theory @xcite . in practice , it turned out that the geometrical quantization of strings works only for either non - physical dimensions @xmath12 @xcite , or in the critical dimension @xmath13 where the world - sheet degrees of freedom of the string decouple from the theory @xcite .",
    "the case of non - critical strings with @xmath12 was also independently formulated in terms of a matrix model which is equivalent to the dynamical triangulations approach @xcite .",
    "this method allows for calculating different topological contributions in the double scaling limit @xcite .",
    "however , both the polyakov conformal field approach and the matrix model calculations break down at @xmath14 .",
    "the problems that turn up at this point , also known as the ` @xmath14 barrier ' , are attributed to instabilities of the conformal mode .    whether it is possible to stabilize the conformal mode for surfaces embedded in physical dimensions is not yet clear .",
    "some attempts to solve this problem have been made within the conformal field formalism @xcite .",
    "another idea is to extend dynamical triangulations to the sypersymmetric case , and to attack the problem directly in physical dimensions . by introducing supersymmetry",
    "one hopes to avoid the instabilities of bosonic surfaces that manifest as the degeneration of the world - sheet geometry into branched polymers @xcite .",
    "disrectization of supersymmetric surfaces is known to be a difficult problem .",
    "a discretization of the world - sheet supersymmetry , for example , inherits all the difficulties which appear arleady on regular lattices @xcite and on top of this it introduces new problems related to the fact that the symmetry must be local @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is broken explicitly by the lattice , and it is not clear how to ascertain whether it gets restored in the continuum limit .",
    "one encounters similar problems for the green - schwarz type of surfaces where one has to preserve the @xmath15-symmetry , which is a local world - sheet symmetry @xcite .",
    "one also attempted to introduce supersymmetry into the surfaces models indirectly by considering models with effective actions with extrinsic curvature terms obtained by integrating out fermions from the supersymetric theory @xcite .",
    "such discretized surfaces have been extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but it is not clear what is nature of the critical point observed in the discretized theory and whether it can be directly related to the original supersymetric theory of continuum surfaces .    in this paper",
    "we study a model of supersymmetric surfaces that constitutes a sort of classical limit of the ikkt matrix model @xcite obtained by sending the matrix size @xmath0 to infinity @xcite .",
    "the attractive feature of the surface model is that the supersymmetry is introduced in such a way that in principle the model can be straightforwardly discretized .",
    "by re - writing the iib string action in the schild gauge @xcite , one avoids the problems related to the proper treatment of the local @xmath15-symmetry in the discretization .",
    "the action that results from this procedure has no redundant degrees of freedom left , and no local symmetry .",
    "we investigate this model by means of the dynamical triangulation approach .",
    "some preliminary studies in this direction were already done in @xcite .",
    "we perform monte - carlo simulations of surfaces embedded in a 4dimensional target space .",
    "we find a theoretical picture that explains the numerical results for @xmath16 , and allows us to make some predictions for the behaviour of the ten  dimensional version of the model .",
    "the results presented here give an insight into typical geometrical features of surfaces that play an important role in the ensemble generated by the ikkt matrix model @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we shortly recall the model and describe the discretization scheme .",
    "then we discuss singularities of the purely bosonic model and show that they are removed by adding fermions . for the model with fermions",
    "we estimate the large @xmath17 behaviour of the partition function by assuming that it is dominated by tube  like configurations .",
    "we present the results of the @xmath18 simulations to show that tubes do indeed dominate in the ensemble .",
    "we conclude the paper with a short discussion , concerning in particular the relation of the results to the matrix model @xcite .",
    "the action for iib strings can be cast into the following form @xcite  : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the metric tensor on the world - sheet ; @xmath21 are bosonic co - ordinates in the @xmath22-dimensional target space ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are @xmath25-dimensional spinors ; and @xmath26 are @xmath27 dirac matrices . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the dimensionality of the spinor representation is @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are majorana - weyl spinors . for @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 , and @xmath29 are weyl spinors .",
    "the poisson brackets in are defined as @xmath32 based on this action the authors of @xcite introduced a matrix model which was then interpreted as a constructive definition of superstring theory . the matrix model is obtained from by substituting fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 by @xmath35 traceless hermitean matrices , and the poisson brackets by commutators @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the resulting theory @xmath37 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\bar{\\phi } \\gamma_\\mu [ a^\\mu , \\phi ] - \\lambda \\mathbbm{1 } \\right ) \\label{maction}\\ ] ] is quantized by the feynman integral @xmath38 with the standard integration measure for traceless hermitean matrices .",
    "this procedure defines a kind of third quantization of string theory , which is supposed to reproduce in a double scaling limit the sum over all topological and geometrical excitations of the world - sheet of strings @xcite .",
    "the original model @xcite was defined in ten dimensions .    here",
    "we will discuss the semiclassical limit of @xmath39 , in which the model reduces to the string theory on a fixed topology @xcite with the partition function @xmath40 where the action is given by .",
    "we will concentrate for now on the case @xmath30 , where we can most easily perform numerical simulations .",
    "we use the dynamical triangulation approach to regularize the integration measure @xmath41 . the partition function",
    "is then given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 the sum runs over equilateral , oriented triangulations @xmath44 with @xmath0 triangles and @xmath45 vertices .",
    "@xmath46 is the symmetry factor of a given @xmath44 , and @xmath47 is the discretized action on this particular triangulation .",
    "primes on the products indicate that the zero modes were removed ( see the following discussion ) . the fields @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "are now located on the vertices of @xmath44 .",
    "the action has one parameter , namely the cosmological constant @xmath50 .",
    "the continuum limit is taken by adjusting @xmath50 in the grand - canonical partition function @xmath51 to its critical value and sending the lattice spacing @xmath52 to zero . alternatively ,",
    "if one prefers to work with the ensemble of canonical partition functions @xmath53 , one can take the continuum limit by simultaneously sending @xmath0 to infinity and @xmath52 to zero while holding the physical area of the worldsheet @xmath54 fixed .",
    "this latter approach is the one we will choose here .",
    "the discretized action consists of two terms , a purely bosonic part @xmath55 and a fermionic part @xmath56 . following the suggestions in @xcite ,",
    "these are  : @xmath57 in contrast to the action presented in @xcite , here @xmath58 are weyl fermions .",
    "the first sum runs over all triangles of the triangulation , the second over all links .",
    "the constant in is set to @xmath59 .",
    "the operation @xmath60 , when acting on an oriented link @xmath61 , gives that neighbour of @xmath62 that comes after @xmath63 when going counterclockwise around @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , if we denote two neighbouring oriented triangles by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( see figure [ omega ] ) .",
    "two neighbouring , oriented triangles @xmath64 and @xmath65 , connected by the link @xmath61 . the ` outer ' vertices @xmath25 and @xmath68 can be accessed by the operation @xmath60 as defined in the text , with @xmath66 and @xmath67.,height=188 ]    two things should be noted about this action .",
    "firstly , the bispinors @xmath58 in the target space have a handedness , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath69 and @xmath70 . using the chiral representation of the dirac matrices in the euclidean sector , @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the pauli matrices and",
    "@xmath73 is the @xmath74 unity matrix , we can parametrize the chiral bispinors @xmath23 and @xmath24 in terms of two - component spinors @xmath75  : @xmath76 thus , we can re - write the fermionic part of the action as @xmath77 \\psi_j   \\label{sf}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 are real numbers that are antisymmetric in @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath79 .",
    "secondly , the action has a zero mode related to the translational invariance in the bosonic sector , @xmath80 . as a remnant of the original supersymmetry",
    ", there is also a similar symmetry in the fermionic sector  : @xmath81 , @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this might be not evident at first sight , but the change in the action is indeed zero , @xmath83 because for each vertex @xmath62 the sum of the @xmath84 over all its neighbours @xmath63 is zero  : @xmath85 .",
    "these zero modes have to be divided out in the measure . in practice , this can be done by inserting a delta function @xmath86 and an additional product @xmath87  which acts like a delta function for the grassmann variables @xmath88  for one vertex .    taking all this into account ,",
    "the canonical partition function for the four dimensional model now reads @xmath89 where @xmath90 integration over the fermions results in the appearance of a factor @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a @xmath93 matrix that is obtained from @xmath94 by crossing out the two rows and columns that correspond to the vertex @xmath68 .",
    "the determinant @xmath95 is a non - negative function of bosonic coordinates @xmath96 , a feature that is essential for the mc simulations .",
    "it follows from the structure of the matrix @xmath92 , which has pairs of complex conjugated eigenvalues @xmath97 .",
    "( more specifically , if @xmath98 is an eigenvector to the eigenvalue @xmath50 , then @xmath99 is an eigenvector to the eigenvalue @xmath100 . )",
    "the final form of the partition function is now @xmath101 where for convenience we introduced an additional parameter @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath103 we have the purely bosonic model ; @xmath104 is the case considered in @xcite ; and @xmath105 corresponds to our partition function .",
    "as we will see , the model with @xmath105 , for which the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom is susy  balanced , is the only interesting one , because only in this case is the partition function well - defined .",
    "the behaviour of the partition function for the purely bosonic model @xmath106 has already been discussed in the context of the quantization of the nambu - goto string @xcite , where it was shown that this partition function is in general not integrable .",
    "namely , one can explicitly construct triangulations for which the integral over bosonic fields is divergent .",
    "the source of this divergence can be intuitively explained as follows .",
    "the bosonic part of the action is the sum of all triangle areas squared , with the areas measured in the target space .",
    "thus , as long as the areas of all triangles stay constant , we can change their shape without changing the action . as an example , let us pick an arbitrary vertex @xmath107 on the triangulation .",
    "it has @xmath108 neighbouring vertices that are linked to each other , forming a loop around @xmath107 ( see figure [ spikes ] ( left ) ) .",
    "origin of spikes  : ( left ) when the white points approach each other to a distance @xmath109 , then the black point can freely move in the embedding space inside a sphere of radius @xmath110 .",
    "( right ) example of the non  integrable configuration : the entropy factor from four spikes ( black points ) overcomes the damping effect of the entropy that comes from the white points which are forced to move close to each other.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   origin of spikes  : ( left ) when the white points approach each other to a distance @xmath109 , then the black point can freely move in the embedding space inside a sphere of radius @xmath110 .",
    "( right ) example of the non  integrable configuration : the entropy factor from four spikes ( black points ) overcomes the damping effect of the entropy that comes from the white points which are forced to move close to each other.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    each link in this loop is the base of one of @xmath107 s neighbouring triangles . now let us shrink these bases to a small length @xmath111 .",
    "( obviously , this step _ will _ change the action , but this is a _",
    "finite _ and _ local _ change that is bounded independently of @xmath111 . )",
    "next , we can move @xmath107 outward to a distance of about @xmath112 , thus creating a long ` spike ' . in this way",
    ", we can have an arbitrarily long spike that does not visibly affect the action if we just simultaneously make the bases small enough .",
    "the phase space volume for such a configuration is a factor @xmath113 coming from the point @xmath107 times a factor @xmath114 coming from constraining the @xmath108 neighbours of @xmath107 to a sphere of radius @xmath111 around one of them .",
    "thus , a spike of length @xmath17 is suppressed , but only _ power  like _ , _ i.e. _ the spikes are not cut off at any particular scale and arbitrarily long fluctuations can occur . when instead of a single  vertex spike one considers configurations with multiple spikes , such as the one in figure [ spikes ] ( right ) , one can check that the spike length distribution may have a logarithmic or stronger divergence .",
    "the question that now arises is , what can be expected to change in this picture if we add the fermionic part to the action and consider the complete partition function @xmath115 ? intuitively , it seems that fermions should introduce a repulsive core to the effective potential between neighbouring vertices on the triangulation , and that this repulsion should prevent vertices from occupying the same position in the target space , which in turn should keep the loop around each vertex from shrinking beyond a certain minimal length . in this case , to create a spike would cost energy , because now the area of a triangle would have to grow to allow it to become elongated .",
    "therefore , one can hope that the introduction of fermions might suppress spikes , along with the divergences they cause .    introducing the fermions",
    "is equivalent to replacing the bosonic action @xmath55 with an effective action @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the determinant of the matrix defined in . @xmath118",
    "vanishes if for any vertex all its neighbouring vertices meet in a single point , because then the two rows of the matrix that correspond to this vertex become zero . similarly ,",
    "if all neighbouring vertices do not exactly meet in one point but move very close to each other , then all entries in these two rows become very small , and the determinant as a whole should likewise become small . in other words , we expect the determinant to discourage small loops and hence also spikes .",
    "it is natural to expect that short loop lengths will be suppressed by a power - like fall - off .    to test this , we used standard monte carlo methods to simulate the model with fermions .",
    "the triangulations , weighted by the effective action , were produced by a metropolis algorithm for geometrical flips and updates of the fields @xmath21 . in four dimensions",
    "the effective action is well - defined since the determinant is positive definite as discussed before .",
    "the bulk of the computer time is spent on calculating the determinant @xmath95 .",
    "this allowed us to produce reasonably large statistics only for fairly small systems ( up to 16 vertices ) .     the gyration radius versus the shortest loop around a vertex on the triangulation , for the model without fermions ( left ) and with fermions ( right ) .",
    "the number of vertices is @xmath119.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] the gyration radius versus the shortest loop around a vertex on the triangulation , for the model without fermions ( left ) and with fermions ( right ) .",
    "the number of vertices is @xmath119.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    the simplest quantity to measure is the average action . using the fact that the bosonic action and the fermionic determinant are uniform polynomials of the bosonic co - ordinates , one can show by a simple scaling argument that the average bosonic action for @xmath30 is @xmath120 .",
    "we used this formula as a rough test of the program .",
    "we also measured the gyration radius @xmath121 and the length of the smallest loop around a vertex that appears on each configuration .",
    "( ` length ' , here , means the sum of the squared lengths of all links in the loop . )",
    "figure [ loop_spikes ] ( left ) shows that in the purely bosonic model there is a strong correlation between the appearance of short loops on the triangulation and a large gyration radius , which supports the picture discussed in the previous section .",
    "note that all results for the bosonic model should be taken with a generous helping of salt , since as noted above the partition function is actually not defined .",
    "these results are presented here merely to illustrate the fact that the source of the singularities can really be found in the appearance of local spikes ( see figure [ needle ] ( left ) ) . for the fermionic case ,",
    "small loops are clearly suppressed , and the only correlation between loop lengths and gyration radius is a trivial one , namely that if the shortest link on a triangulation has a length @xmath111 , the gyration radius itself can not be smaller than @xmath111 , either .",
    "we conclude that fermions do in fact suppress spikes . for the smallest possible spherical triangulation , the tetrahedron",
    ", one can actually show analytically that the partition function for the fermionic model exists in four dimensions , whereas for the bosonic model it does not @xcite .",
    "however , both the analytical calculations for the tetrahedron and numerical simulations of larger surfaces indicate that even in the fermionic case the gyration radius distribution has a power  like tail ( see the appendix and figure  [ fig : hist ] ( left ) ) . what is the source of the singular behaviour in this case , when we know that we do not have local spikes ?",
    "it turns out that there is another type of configuration that can contribute to the tail of the probability distribution @xmath2 for large @xmath3 .",
    "these things look like _ needles _ ; the four - dimensional degrees of freedom of the co - ordinates in the target space collapse to a one - dimensional , elongated narrow tube .     snapshots of a susy triangulation from the tail of the gyration radius distribution ( right ) , and a bosonic configuration of comparable size ( left ) .",
    "the @xmath122-component in the plot corresponds to the projection of the vertex position onto the longest principal axis in the system , while the @xmath123-component describes the distance from the axis .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the length of the tube , @xmath111 its radius and @xmath3 the gyration radius , title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] snapshots of a susy triangulation from the tail of the gyration radius distribution ( right ) , and a bosonic configuration of comparable size ( left ) .",
    "the @xmath122-component in the plot corresponds to the projection of the vertex position onto the longest principal axis in the system , while the @xmath123-component describes the distance from the axis .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the length of the tube , @xmath111 its radius and @xmath3 the gyration radius , title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    to indentify these configurations we used the principal component analysis ( pca ) . for each analysed configuration we calculated the correlation matrix @xmath124 and its eigenvalues",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue defined the principial axis .",
    "for each point on the configuration @xmath48 we then calculated its projection on the pricipial axis , @xmath125 , and its distance from it , @xmath126 .",
    "we defined the length @xmath17 and radius @xmath111 of the tube by @xmath127 the ratio of length to width can serve as an estimator of the type of the configuration .",
    "for the bosonic string , this ratio was @xmath128 , and for the fermionic one , @xmath129 .",
    "two typical results of this analysis are depicted in figure [ needle ] where we show , for comparison , snapshots of triangulations for the bosonic ( left ) and susy ( right ) models for @xmath130 , projected onto the principal axis .",
    "how can the appearance of needles be explained ?",
    "the bosonic part of the action is a sum of contributions from separate triangles .",
    "the contribution from a single triangle is minimal when its three vertices lie on a line , in which case the square of the triangle area is zero .",
    "one type of zero - action triangles are the spikes that were discussed in the previous section . on a spike",
    ", two vertices of the triangle lie very close to  or , in the limiting case , on top of  each other , so that together with the third vertex they will automatically form a line .",
    "another possible type of zero - action triangles are those that have three distinct ( and distant ) points that lie on , or close to , a single line . from the point of view of just one triangle , this type of zero - action configuration is more likely to occur than a spiky one , for which one has to move two vertices into exactly the same point ; but when one looks at the triangulation as a whole , one sees that the probability for this to happen is actually much smaller , because having three long links means that either there will be three neighbouring triangles with large areas ( which is suppressed by the action ) , or there will be three more triangles lying on exactly the same line .",
    "the same argument can then be applied to the neighbours of _ these _ triangles as well , and on and on until one arrives at a configuration where all triangles lie on a single line , _ i.e. _ a configuration that is just one - dimensional",
    ". contrary to spikes , which are defects that involve only a few triangles and that are basically independent of the rest of the triangulation , a needle requires a global arrangement of vertices that minimizes the action .",
    "such a global arrangement is entropically disfavoured and therefore does not occur in the bosonic model . here",
    ", however , the fermionic determinant provides an additional factor that favours configurations with vertices far removed from each other .",
    "as it turns out , this term is sufficient to exceed the damping effect coming from the entropy .    to see this",
    ", we will try to estimate the contribution of the needle  like configurations to the partition function .",
    "let us assume that we fix one point on the surface ( thus getting rid of the zero mode ) , and also set the length of one link emerging from this point to @xmath17 . in the following , we will refer to the direction along this link as _ long _ and to the transverse directions as _ short_. consider now a tube of radius @xmath131 around the long direction .",
    "clearly , if we constrain all the points to lie inside the tube , the area of each triangle will not exceed @xmath132 .",
    "as the action is the sum of the areas squared of the individual triangles , it will be bounded from above by @xmath133 _ independently _ of @xmath17 .",
    "assuming that all the vertices are free to move independently inside the tube , we can estimate the contribution to the partition function coming from this configuration as  : @xmath134 here , @xmath135 is the fermionic determinant for the tube  like configuration .",
    "we have to integrate over only @xmath136 vertex positions because we already fixed one of them . by choosing a convenient co - ordinate system",
    ", we can set this fixed vertex to the origin , and the vertex at the other end of the link to @xmath137 .",
    "this naturally defines the direction of the needle .",
    "since the needle may point in any direction in four - dimensional space , integration over the position of this point contributes a factor @xmath138 to the integral .",
    "each of the @xmath139 remaining vertices then contributes one integration over @xmath17 and three integrations over short components , resulting finally in .",
    "the determinant @xmath135 is a uniform polynomial of degree @xmath140 , so one would expect at first glance that in the large @xmath17 limit the leading contribution should be @xmath141 .",
    "however , as we will show in the appendix , because of additional symmetries of the matrix all terms containing only long directions cancel , and we get @xmath142 for even @xmath68 and @xmath143 for odd @xmath68 . inserting this into and integrating over all but one long component  which corresponds to substituting @xmath144 and @xmath145 ",
    "we eventually obtain  : @xmath146 because the configuration is essentially one  dimensional and the length of the tube is given by @xmath17 , we expect the gyration radius to be proportional to this , @xmath147 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath3 , we expect a similarly power  like tail in the gyration radius distribution , @xmath148 _ if _ the needle  like configurations dominate in the partition function .    for the purely bosonic case @xmath103 , @xmath149 grows with the size of the system and the tail becomes less singular .",
    "this suppresses needles .",
    "in fact , as we already discussed , in this case the spiky configurations win entropically over the needles , and it is they who are responsible for the singularities of the partition function for bosonic surfaces .    for @xmath105 , the formula gives @xmath150 for configurations with an even number of vertices and @xmath151 for those with an odd number .",
    "these exponents do not grow with @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath152 , the exponent @xmath153 decreases with @xmath68 and very quickly becomes smaller than one .",
    "the tail @xmath154 of @xmath2 becomes non - integrable , signalling that the partition does not exist in this case except for a very few small systems that have @xmath153 larger than one , such as the tetrahedron , for which the formula predicts @xmath155 .",
    "( this result for the tetrahedron can actually be derived in a straightforward analytic calculation , as shown in the appendix . )    to test these predictions , we measured the exponent @xmath153 numerically for different values of @xmath68 and @xmath102 .",
    "numerical simulations for problems with a power  like distribution are difficult because in this case one has rare but important events . in our case",
    ", the distribution @xmath156 means that we expect rare , long excursions in the configuration space which produce large @xmath3 s . technically , it is difficult to explore this part of the phase space , because the bulk of the probability distribution is concentrated around small @xmath3 where the program spends almost the whole time .",
    "to prevent this , we introduced a lower limit @xmath157 on @xmath3 , as well as an upper limit @xmath158 to prevent the program from doing too long excursions to large values of @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise , the program would not have a well defined autocorrelation time .",
    "experimentally we found it convenient to set the limits @xmath159 and @xmath160 when we expected a negative @xmath153 , and only an upper limit @xmath161 when we expected the distribution @xmath2 to grow with @xmath3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : hist ] , we show two examples of the numerically obtained distribution @xmath2  : for @xmath130 and @xmath162 , where according to the formula ( [ pl ] ) we expect @xmath163 , and for @xmath164 and @xmath165 , where we expect @xmath166 .",

    "one possibility is that this discrepancy is due to finite size effects , and would diminish if we were to go to larger systems ; another is that our theoretical argument is simply too rough and works only as a first approximation . in any case , we know from the analysis of sample configurations , as presented in figure [ needle ] , that we do have needles in this case . for @xmath105 and an odd number of vertices , the difference is huge but not surprising , since the analysis shows that these configurations are not needles , but look rather like small clumps with a single long spike growing out of them .",
    "it would seem that these things are suppressed by a power that is smaller than @xmath167 but still larger than @xmath168 , so that they can dominate over needles in odd-@xmath68 cases but not in even-@xmath68 ones .",

    "the function @xmath135 is a uniform polynomial of the bosonic components of order for @xmath173 . because of zero modes occurring in the minimal blocks of the fermionic matrix ( as discussed in detail for @xmath30 in the appendix ) , the terms with maximal power of @xmath17 cancel and the leading terms for large @xmath17 are @xmath174",
    "thus , for the tube we get @xmath175 .",
    "inserting this into leaves us with @xmath176 in the susy case , _",
    "i. e. _ @xmath105 , the tail of the probability distribution @xmath177 is independent of @xmath68 .",
    "it is the same behaviour as the one obtained in the matrix model from the analysis of the spectrum of large eigenvalues @xcite .    for @xmath152 ,",
    "the needle - like configurations lead to a non ",
    "integrable singularity and the partition function is divergent in this case . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the singularity becomes softer when @xmath68 goes to infinity .",
    "we know , however , that in this case needles do not play any important role in the picture .    to summarize , the discussion presented above allows predictions for the singular behaviour of the partition function in those cases when needle  like configurations dominate in the ensemble .",
    "we have investigated geometrical properties of the large @xmath0 limit of the ikkt matrix model , which corresponds also to the reduced supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "we showed that the originally four - dimensional theory reduces to a one - dimensional one and is dominated by elongated tube - like configurations .",
    "the gyration radius distribution has a power  like tail @xmath156 , where @xmath153 is roughly consistent with the value of @xmath178 obtained from the theoretical power  counting for needle - like configurations .",
    "repeated in @xmath179 the power  counting for such one  dimensional configurations gives distributions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "strikingly , the same behaviour is expected from the analysis of the large @xmath3 singularities of the matrix model yang - mills integrals @xcite .",
    "this result has never been proven for the matrix model ( except for @xmath180 ) , but if it holds , in view of our geometrical picture it would mean that the yang  mills integrals are also dominated by one  dimensional structures for large @xmath3 .    it is clear from our considerations that if too many fermionic degrees of freedom were added to the model ( @xmath181 ) , the power @xmath153 would decrease with @xmath68 and the partition function would soon become divergent . on the other hand ,",
    "if there were too few degrees of freedom , as in the purely bosonic case , the singularity of the needle  like configurations would become softer for larger @xmath68 similarly as in the purely bosonic matrix model @xcite .",
    "we know , however , that in this case the surface model has a different type of singularity , corresponding to the local creation of spikes , caused by a sort of local flat direction in the action .",
    "the effect introduces a stronger singularity that , again , makes the partition function ill - defined . in summary , only the proper susy balance between fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom guarantees the existence of the surface theory .",
    "the results presented in this work are based on numerical simulations of rather small systems .",
    "it would be very interesting to perform a systematic analysis of the finite size effects .",
    "this would , however , require a considerable effort to improve the fermionic algorithm .",
    "the work was partially supported by the dfg pe 340/9 - 1 grant , the ec ihp network _",
    "hprn - ct-1999 - 000161 _ and the kbn grants 2p03b00814 and 2p03b14917 .",
    "p.b . acknowledges financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation during the first stage of this work .",
    "in the first part of the appendix , we will shortly repeat calculations of the partition function @xmath182 for the tetrahedron @xcite , and extend them to calculate the probability distribution of the link length .    introduce a co - ordinate system in the target space such that the origin coincides with one of these vertices , setting",
    "_ e. g. _ @xmath183 .",
    "next , choose the four axes  called here @xmath184 and @xmath185  such that one other vertex lies on the @xmath17 axis , one lies in the @xmath186 plane , and one in the @xmath187 hyperplane .",
    "thus , we have @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 .",
    "the determinant @xmath95 in this co - ordinate system becomes @xcite @xmath191 inserting this into and integrating out all co - ordinates except @xmath192 and @xmath193 leads to @xmath194 for large @xmath192 , @xmath193 is of order @xmath195 , fixed by the combination @xmath196 in the exponent .",
    "the integration over @xmath193 therefore effectively corresponds to setting @xmath197 ( including in the measure @xmath198 ) .",
    "thus , for large @xmath192 , the resulting integral is dominated by the contribution @xmath199 the component @xmath192 of the vertex @xmath200 is the length @xmath17 of the link between vertices @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "since there is nothing to distinguish between different links , @xmath203 can be viewed as the probability distribution of the link length for large @xmath17 .    as can be seen from , for the tetrahedron",
    "the determinant contains short components to the fourth power , namely @xmath204 .",
    "we will show that this feature of the determinant is not particular to the tetrahedron , but appears in any needle - like configuration with an even number of vertices , whereas for any needle with an odd number of vertices we find eight short components .",
    "the reason for this lies in the dirac structure of the fermionic matrix .    to see this ,",
    "let us define a matrix @xmath205 which for @xmath206 is equal to the fermionic matrix , @xmath207 .",
    "the matrices @xmath208 are antisymmetric @xmath209 matrices , @xmath210 . by construction , for needle  like configurations all elements of @xmath211 are linear in the long components @xmath17 , while those of the @xmath212 are linear in the short ones , @xmath213 .",
    "our aim is to prove that the leading term of the determinant @xmath214 is proportional to at least @xmath215 for even configurations and @xmath216 for odd , which is equivalent to saying that the leading term contains at least four / eight small components , which in turn gives @xmath217 and @xmath218 for even and odd configurations , respectively .",
    "we will use first order perturbation theory to show this .",
    "first of all , note that @xmath211 has at least one zero eigenvalue , because for strictly one - dimensional configurations with @xmath219 the action has an additional zero mode coming from invariance under a change @xmath220 .",
    "( this is a discrete remnant of a more general invariance @xmath221 of the continuous action , with an arbitrary function @xmath222 . ) for the truncated matrix @xmath211 , this corresponds to a zero eigenvector @xmath223 thus , we also have @xmath224 , which already excludes terms of order @xmath225 .",
    "consider now separately the case of even @xmath68 . because @xmath211 has the zero eigenvector @xmath226 , @xmath227 has at least two eigenvectors @xmath228 and @xmath22 , which we can write as @xmath229 under a small perturbation @xmath230 the eigenvalues @xmath50 of @xmath227 are changed to @xmath231 .",
    "denote the first order correction to @xmath232 by @xmath233 .",
    "the determinant to this order is then proportional to @xmath234 , where the product runs over nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath235 .",
    "@xmath233 fulfills the equation @xmath236 which gives @xmath237 due to the antisymmetry of the @xmath212  : @xmath238 for any @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue @xmath232 remains intact to first order , which means that all terms of order @xmath239 likewise vanish in the determinant of @xmath240 .",
    "therefore , the leading terms must be at least of order @xmath215 .",
    "one can check that , generically , they are indeed of this order .    for odd @xmath68 , @xmath211 is an even by even antisymmetric matrix and , as such , can not have just one zero eigenvector but must have at least two , which we will call @xmath241 and @xmath226 .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath227 has at least four such eigenvectors , which we write as @xmath242 repeating the perturbation analysis in @xmath243 for the matrix @xmath240 , we find for the first order correction @xmath233  : @xmath244 ^ 2   = 0 \\ , .\\ ] ] we will now argue that all three terms in the sum vanish , and therefore @xmath237 .",
    "this follows from the peculiar structure of the matrices @xmath208 . as we know",
    ", their elements are linear in the components @xmath21 , and moreover all the matrices have the same structure .",
    "therefore , we can introduce a linear function @xmath245 such that @xmath246 . also , the eigenvector @xmath226 is likewise linear in @xmath21 , and we can again write @xmath247 .",
    "now we have @xmath248 ( in the first step , we just added @xmath249 ; in the second , we used the fact that @xmath250 ; and in the third , we used the linearity of @xmath245 and @xmath226 . )",
    "thus , we have shown that there are still four zero eigenvalues even to first order of @xmath243 . as with",
    "even @xmath68 , we checked numerically that they are non - zero to the second order .",
    "thus , the leading term in this case behaves as @xmath216 .",
