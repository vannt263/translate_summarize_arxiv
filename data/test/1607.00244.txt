    "left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite has been one of the most widely studied beyond standard model ( bsm ) scenarios in the last few decades .",
    "the model not only explains the sub - ev neutrino mass @xcite naturally through seesaw mechanisms @xcite but also gives rise to low energy parity violations though spontaneous breaking of a parity preserving symmetry at high scale that can also be incorporated within grand unified theory groups like @xmath1 naturally",
    ". the minimal version of this model give rise to tiny neutrino masses through a combination of type i @xcite and type ii @xcite seesaw mechanisms .",
    "due to the structure of type i seesaw term , one usually has heavy right handed neutrinos in such a model , in order to generate sub - ev neutrino mass from type i seesaw . in tev scale lrsm , one can have right handed neutrino mass @xmath2 tev ( say ) which can give sub - ev light neutrinos from type i seesaw if the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings should be fine tuned to @xmath3 .",
    "similar fine - tuning is also involved in the type ii seesaw term as we discuss in the next section .",
    "such fine - tunings become more severe if we wish to keep one or two of the right handed neutrinos at very light scale , say between ev to kev .",
    "such light sterile neutrinos could have very interesting implications for low energy neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath4 @xcite , dark matter @xcite and cosmology in general @xcite .",
    "the lrsm also received significant attention after the recent hints from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) about the possibility of tev scale new physics : the cms @xmath5 excess @xcite , the atlas diboson excess @xcite and more recently , the 750 gev diphoton excess @xcite .",
    "the first two excesses around 2 tev can be explained within a version of lrsm where the discrete left - right symmetry ( to be introduced below ) gets broken at a high energy scale @xcite whereas the gauge symmetry of lrsm remains unbroken all the way down to the tev scale .",
    "the recent 750 gev diphoton excess can however , be explained within lrsm framework only when it is extended with additional vector like fermions @xcite or with fields having high @xmath6 dimensions",
    "the vector like fermions , as discussed in these works , can serve three purposes : ( i ) to explain the large diphoton cross section at 750 gev , ( ii ) to provide masses to all the fermions of the standard model ( sm ) through a universal seesaw mechanism @xcite and ( ii ) to assist in gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "this model can also have interesting implications for cosmology @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study a class of left - right symmetric models to see the possibility of having light sterile neutrinos at a scale much below the scale of left - right symmetry .",
    "typically , the right handed neutrinos in lrsm have masses around the scale of left - right symmetry .",
    "thus , in tev scale lrsm , one usually have right handed neutrinos in the gev to tev range .",
    "if we fine tune the yukawa couplings to be as small as electron yukawa , then we can get right handed neutrinos of the order of tens of mev .",
    "we therefore study some non - minimal versions of lrsm where one can have light right handed neutrinos in the ev - kev regime even with order one yukawa couplings . starting with the lrsm having universal seesaw for all fermions",
    ", we explore a few other possibilities : ( i ) light neutrinos as dirac fermions , ( ii ) both left and right handed neutrinos acquire majorana mass terms through radiative type ii seesaw and ( iii ) left handed neutrinos acquire masses through radiative type i seesaw . in all of these possibilities , we consider additional discrete symmetries to stabilise the particles going inside the loops so that the lightest neutral particle among them can be a cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate .",
    "this follows the basic idea of scotogenic models first proposed by @xcite .",
    "apart from the stable cold dark matter candidate , these models can also have a long lived kev scale right handed neutrino that can be a warm dark matter ( wdm ) candidate .",
    "such kev scale sterile neutrino dark matter within minimal lrsm was discussed by @xcite and a radiative neutrino mass model with both cold and warm dark matter components have been proposed recently by @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the possible implications of these scenarios in @xmath7 , collider experiments and cosmology .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the minimal lrsm and then discuss the lrsm with universal seesaw in section [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss different possible versions of scotogenic lrsm where neutrinos acquire masses at one loop level with dark matter particles going inside the loops . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we discuss the possibilities of light sterile or right handed neutrinos in these models followed by their implications in @xmath7 and colliders in section [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] respectively .",
    "we then comment upon cosmological implications of these scenarios in section [ sec7 ] and finally conclude in section [ sec8 ] .",
    "left - right symmetric model @xcite is one of the best motivated bsm frameworks where the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory is extended to @xmath8 .",
    "the right handed fermions are doublets under @xmath9 similar to the way left handed fermions transform as doublets under @xmath10 .",
    "the requirement of an anomaly free @xmath11 makes the presence of right handed neutrinos a necessity rather than a choice . to allow dirac yukawa couplings between @xmath12 doublet fermions ,",
    "the higgs field has to transform as a bidoublet under @xmath12 . in order to break the gauge symmetry of the model to that of the sm spontaneously ,",
    "scalar triplet fields with non - zero @xmath11 charges are introduced , which also give majorana masses to the left and right handed neutrinos .",
    "the fermion content of the minimal lrsm is @xmath13 @xmath14 similarly , the higgs content of the minimal lrsm is @xmath15 @xmath16 where the numbers in brackets denote the transformations of the fields under the gauge group @xmath17 . during the spontaneous symmetry breaking of lrsm gauge group down to the sm gauge group ,",
    "the neutral component of the higgs triplet @xmath18 acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) after which the neutral components of higgs bidoublet @xmath19 acquire non - zero vev s to break the sm gauge symmetry into the @xmath20 of electromagnetism .",
    "this symmetry breaking chain can be denoted as : @xmath21 denoting the vev of the two neutral components of the bidoublet as @xmath22 and that of triplets @xmath23 as @xmath24 and considering @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the approximate expressions for gauge boson masses after symmetry breaking can be written as @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the relevant yukawa couplings for fermion masses can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in the above yukawa lagrangian",
    ", the indices @xmath33 correspond to the three generations of fermions .",
    "the majorana yukawa couplings @xmath34 is same for both left and right handed neutrinos because of the in built left - right symmetry @xmath35 . these couplings @xmath34 give rise to the majorana mass terms of both left handed and right handed neutrinos after the triplet higgs fields @xmath36 acquire non - zero vev .",
    "although it is the @xmath18 field which gets a vev at high scale breaking the left - right symmetry , the subsequent electroweak symmetry breaking induces a non - zero vev to the left handed counterpart .",
    "the induced vev for the left - handed triplet @xmath37 can be shown for generic lrsm to be @xmath38 with @xmath39 gev being the weak boson mass such that @xmath40 in general @xmath41 is a function of various couplings in the scalar potential of generic lrsm . using the results from deshpande et al .",
    ", @xcite , @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 are dimensionless parameters of the scalar potential . without any fine tuning @xmath41 is expected to be of the order unity ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "however , for tev scale type i+ii seesaw , @xmath41 has to be fine - tuned as we discuss later . the type ii seesaw formula for light neutrino masses",
    "can now be expressed as @xmath45 if we consider the first term on the right hand side of the above expression , one can make an estimate of neutrino mass for tev scale lrsm .",
    "considering @xmath46 tev , the type ii seesaw term will be of the order of light neutrino mass @xmath47 ev if @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the right handed neutrino mass .",
    "thus , for tev scale right handed neutrino masses , the dimensionless parameter @xmath41 is fine tuned to the level of @xmath50 in order to get correct order of neutrino masses .",
    "this will involve unnatural fine tuning of the scalar potential parameters appearing in the expression for @xmath41 given in .",
    "similar but slightly less fine tuning is involved in the type i seesaw term for tev scale @xmath51 .",
    "the dirac yukawa couplings should be fine tuned to around @xmath52 in order to get light neutrino mass of order @xmath53 ev .",
    "in minimal lrsm with higgs bidoublet and higgs triplets discussed above , the light neutrino masses arise at tree level . if the triplets are replaced by higgs doublets , then additional fermions are required for seesaw mechanisms . in the absence of them , neutrinos have only a dirac mass term due to the bidoublet , which typically is of the order of charged lepton masses .",
    "thus , the tree level dirac mass term of neutrinos can be prevented only in the absence of higgs bidoublet . indeed ,",
    "lrsm without higgs bidoublet has found some attention in the literature @xcite . this model was studied later in the context of cosmology @xcite and neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .",
    "very recently this model was also studied in the context of 750 gev di - photon excess at lhc @xcite by several authors @xcite .",
    "the model has additional vector like fermions in order to generate all the fermion masses from universal seesaw .",
    "the fermion content of the lrsm with universal seesaw is the extension of the mlrsm fermion content by the following vector like fermions @xmath54 @xmath55 per generation of quarks and leptons . instead of higgs bidoublet , this model has a pair of higgs doublets @xmath56    the non - zero vev of the neutral component of @xmath57 also breaks the @xmath58 symmetry of the model into @xmath59 of the standard model .",
    "the left handed higgs doublet can acquire a non - zero vev @xmath60 at a lower energy to induce electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the left - right symmetry of the theory forces one to have the same vev for both @xmath61 and @xmath57 that is , @xmath62 which is unacceptable from phenomenological point of view . to decouple these two symmetry breaking scales ,",
    "the extra singlet scalar @xmath63 is introduced into the model .",
    "this field is odd under the discrete left - right symmetry and hence couple to the two scalar doublets with a opposite sign .",
    "after this singlet acquires a non - zero vev at high scale , this generates a difference between the effective mass squared of @xmath61 and @xmath57 which ultimately decouples the symmetry breaking scales .    due to the absence of the usual bidoublet ,",
    "the left and right handed fermion doublets of the mslrm can not directly couple to each other .",
    "however , they can couple to the scalar fields @xmath64 via the additional vector like fermions .",
    "@xmath65 after integrating out the heavy fermions , the charged fermions of the standard model develop yukawa couplings to the scalar doublet @xmath61 as follows @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the vev of the neutral component of @xmath57 .",
    "the apparent seesaw then can explain the observed mass hierarchies among the three generations of fermions .",
    "the neutrino mass arises in a more complicated seesaw due to additional majorana mass terms for @xmath68 shown above .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the neutrino mass matrix in the basis @xmath69 can have three independent terms @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 after integrating out the heavy neutral fermions @xmath73 .",
    "this mass matrix can further be diagonalised to get the type i seesaw formula for neutrino mass which however , is suppressed by @xmath74 compared to @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the left and right handed neutrinos have majorana mass terms which are related by @xmath76 if we have a tev scale left - right symmetry breaking say @xmath77 tev , then the above relation says @xmath78 .",
    "thus for @xmath79 ev , the right handed neutrino masses are @xmath80 ev . such light right handed neutrinos will have very interesting implications in cosmology , collider as well as neutrinoless double beta decay experiments , when the lr gauge boson masses are around the tev corner .",
    "one can however , keep them hidden in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments by tuning the @xmath81 element of the right handed neutrino mass matrix to zero . on the other hand , direct search experiments like the lhc search for heavy neutrinos and @xmath82 bosons at 8 tev centre of mass energy already excludes a wide range of heavy neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "however , as can be seen from the @xmath83 exclusion plot in @xcite , the experimental sensitivity is not so good for the low mass regime of right handed neutrinos .",
    "also , a right handed neutrino in the ev - kev regime will not give rise to the same sign dilepton plus two jets signatures which are being looked at by lhc experiments to put bounds on @xmath83 parameter space @xcite .",
    "such light right handed neutrinos will also induce non - unitarity to leptonic mixing matrix of the order @xmath84 which will again constrain @xmath85 to a small number for tev scale @xmath67 . if we want to keep the right handed neutrino mass at kev scale , the left - right symmetry breaking scale has to be @xmath86 tev , beyond the reach of lhc .",
    "since the tev scale lrsm with universal seesaw for all fermions generate three ultra light right handed neutrinos , which may be in conflict with experiments from colliders to cosmology , one can find suitable alternative to this .",
    "one such immediate remedy is to consider universal seesaw for charged fermions and radiative masses for neutrinos .",
    "one such possibility was discussed very recently in @xcite where neutrino mass was generated at two - loop level along with a bonus of having a long lived kev neutrino dark matter .",
    "here we consider another possibility of having radiative neutrino mass where the particles running inside the loop can be stable dark matter candidates .",
    "we consider two possibilities where light neutrinos can be either of dirac type or of majorana type .",
    "let us consider a version of lrsm with universal seesaw for all the charged fermions but zero tree level masses for neutrinos .",
    "this corresponds to the model discussed above but without the neutral fermion pairs @xmath73 . instead of that , consider the addition of following particles into the model with their transformations under the lrsm gauge group as well as an additional symmetry forbidding tree level neutrino mass and guaranteeing the stability of dark matter .",
    "these new particle sector consists of scalar doublets @xmath87 and fermion singlets @xmath88 .",
    "the additional symmetry can either be discrete @xmath89 or a continuous one like @xmath90 .",
    "we show one simple example of @xmath91 in this subsection .",
    "the fields taking part in radiative neutrino mass generation are shown in table [ tab : data1 ] .",
    "since the higgs doublets @xmath64 have trivial transformations under the additional @xmath91 , the usual mass terms for charged fermions are allowed .",
    "all other particles in lrsm with universal seesaw for charged fermions do not transform under this additional symmetry .",
    "such a structure of new particles and symmetry will give rise to the one - loop dirac neutrino mass shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "one loop dirac neutrino mass in a scotogenic fashion was first proposed in @xcite within a model where the sm gauge symmetry was extended by @xmath11 and additional @xmath0 discrete symmetries .",
    ".particle content for radiative dirac neutrino masses [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "due to the presence of several new vector , scalar and fermionic particles in lrsm , one can have various new physics contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath92 .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams and the calculation details can be found in several earlier works @xcite and references therein .",
    "apart from the sm contribution mediated by light neutrinos and @xmath93 bosons , there can be contributions from ( a ) right handed neutrino and @xmath82 , ( b ) mixing between heavy and light neutrinos ( c ) @xmath94 mixing and ( d ) triplet scalars in type ii seesaw scenarios .",
    "here we consider only the right handed neutrino with @xmath82 contribution as new physics and ignore the active - sterile , @xmath95 mixing and triplet scalar contributions .    the amplitude of the light neutrino contribution is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 mev is the average momentum exchange of the process , @xmath98 are the masses of three light neutrinos and @xmath99 is the standard pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "the contribution from the heavy neutrino and @xmath82 exchange can be written in the limit @xmath100 as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the heavy neutrino mixing matrix and @xmath103 are the masses of heavy right handed neutrinos .",
    "thus the total contribution to @xmath92 process is @xmath104 where @xmath105 are effective neutrino masses corresponding to light neutrino and heavy neutrino exchanges respectively . here",
    ", @xmath106 is the nuclear matrix element .",
    "now , for lrsm with universal seesaw , the light and heavy neutrino mass matrices are related by a factor @xmath107 where @xmath108 gev . similarly in the radiative type ii seesaw model , they are related by a factor @xmath109 which is also true for tree level type ii seesaw model . since the heavy and light neutrino mass matrix is similar upto a factor , we can consider @xmath110 in the above expressions .",
    "also the mass eigenvalues will be related by the same numerical factor @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the new physics contribution can be written as @xmath112 using the standard parameterisation of pmns mixing matrix in terms of three angles and three cp phases ( one dirac and two majorana phases ) , one can write down the light neutrino contribution as @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 being the mixing angles and @xmath116 are majorana cp phases . fixing the lightest right handed neutrino mass to be 1 gev and hence @xmath117 , we calculate the heavy neutrino contribution to the effective neutrino mass .",
    "the contribution is found to be minimal for majorana cp phases @xmath118 as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that such a scenario with @xmath119 gev , @xmath120 tev and normal hierarchy of light neutrinos is ruled out from existing experimental constraint . for inverted hierarchy also , the region for @xmath121 ev is ruled out whereas the @xmath122 ev region contribution almost coincides with the experimental upper bound .",
    "choosing different values of majorana phases rules out even more parameter space .",
    "similarly , we calculate the right handed neutrino contribution for masses @xmath123 mev . in such low mass regime , the right handed neutrino contribution has a similar expression as standard light neutrino contribution upto a scaling factor of gauge boson mass ratio .",
    "the right handed neutrino contribution is found to be minimal for majorana cp phases @xmath124 as seen from figure [ fig31 ] .",
    "it can be seen that inverted hierarchy of light neutrino spectrum is already ruled out for such a case with @xmath120 tev .",
    "the normal hierarchical scenario survives only in a narrow region of parameter space around @xmath125 ev . after showing the allowed parameter space for a specific choice of @xmath126 ,",
    "we show the allowed regions of @xmath127 and @xmath128 parameter space in figure [ fig4 ] and [ fig41 ] , by incorporating the experimental upper bound on @xmath7 amplitude .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig41 ] , one can still have kev scale right handed neutrino along with a tev scale @xmath82 after incorporating experimental constraints on @xmath7 lifetime .",
    "depending on the origin of light neutrino masses , there can be different collider signatures for the new physics sector responsible for it .",
    "if neutrinos are dirac fermions such that @xmath129 form a dirac fermion with ev scale dirac mass , then one can not have on - shell production of same sign dilepton plus dijet signatures mediated by @xmath82 bosons .",
    "such a process was proposed @xcite to be a clean signature of right handed gauge bosons with heavy majorana neutrinos . in these scenarios",
    "@xmath82 boson can decay into @xmath130 final states in a way similar to @xmath93 decay into @xmath131 .",
    "also , due to the presence of scalar doublet dark matter candidate , @xmath82 can also have decay into dijet plus missing energy through @xmath132 or @xmath133 . here",
    "@xmath134 in final states can give rise to missing energy , if it is the lightest neutral particle stabilised by the remnant @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "however , if neutrinos are majorana fermions and heavy neutrinos are in the gev - tev range with tev scale @xmath82 , they can be constrained by lhc data from the search of dilepton plus dijet . for even lower masses of right handed neutrinos",
    "say , in the kev regime , lhc sensitivity may not be enough and one has to go for alternate probes like neutrinoless double beta decay , discussed above .",
    "apart from heavy neutrino mediated dilepton plus dijet final states , one can also have other interesting collider signatures due to the presence of additional scalars .",
    "the scalar sector of mlrsm and some of its minimal variants have been extensively studied by several groups @xcite . in the model with radiative type ii seesaw , one can have light doubly charged scalars similar to mlrsm . however , their collider signatures can be entirely different .",
    "the present lhc lower bounds on doubly charged scalar masses ( 465 - 550 gev for @xmath135 , 370 - 435 gev for @xmath136 ) @xcite are derived by considering @xmath137 branching ratio into same sign lepton pairs . in the radiative type ii seesaw model discussed above",
    ", the doubly charged scalars do not have tree level coupling to the leptons and hence their decay into lepton pairs will be suppressed .",
    "thus , the above bounds are not applicable and one can have lighter doubly charged boson as well . in the model discussed here , one can have @xmath138 or @xmath139 with the @xmath93 boson finally decaying into two jets or leptons . considering leptonic final states only , both the decay modes can contribute to same sign dilepton plus missing energy signatures .",
    "similar conclusions can be made for right handed doubly charged scalar @xmath140 as well .    in the model with radiative type",
    "i seesaw , the doubly charged scalars have tree level coupling to leptons .",
    "however , the neutral component of the left handed triplet does not acquire any vev .",
    "therefore the decay channel @xmath138 is absent .",
    "however @xmath36 still couples to scalar doublets @xmath87 and hence both @xmath141 and @xmath139 are possible in such a scenario .",
    "same conclusion can be made for right handed triplet scalar as well .",
    "cosmological implications for sterile neutrinos with masses from ev scale to gev - tev scale are well described in the recent review @xcite . here",
    "we focus only on the ev - kev range as the above analysis was primarily focussed on generating sterile neutrino masses in this range . the left - right symmetric model with light sterile neutrinos in ev to kev scale along with a cold dark matter candidate as discussed above can have interesting implications for cosmology .",
    "if one or more of the right handed neutrinos have masses in the ev range , then they can contribute to the total radiation content of the universe .",
    "such extra relativistic degrees of freedom may affect the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) predictions as well as cause changes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum .",
    "the latest cosmology data from planck experiment @xcite constrains the the effective relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath142 .    in the model where the light neutrinos are dirac ,",
    "the right handed components contribute extra degrees of freedom to @xmath143 . as shown in @xcite",
    ", this can evade the bbn bound if the right handed neutrinos decouple much earlier that is @xmath144 .",
    "the @xmath145 contribution to @xmath143 gets diluted due to the decrease in effective relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath146 as the universe cools down from @xmath147 to @xmath148 : @xmath149 since @xmath150 for the relativistic degrees of freedom in sm at @xmath151 mev , the right handed neutrinos can evade the planck bound if @xmath152 .",
    "this implies that the right handed neutrinos should decouple before the qcd phase transition temperature 200 - 400 mev .",
    "the decoupling temperature of right handed neutrinos can be calculated by following the same procedure for left handed neutrinos and replacing the @xmath93 mass with @xmath82 . in terms of @xmath148 , it can be written as @xmath153 demanding @xmath154 mev and taking @xmath155 mev , we can arrive at the bound on @xmath126 as @xmath156 where we have considered @xmath157 , which is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom just above the qcd phase transition temperature .",
    "the bound on @xmath82 mass from cosmology in this scenario is stronger than the direct search limits discussed earlier .",
    "similar bounds will also be applicable in those models where active neutrinos are majorana but one or two of the sterile or right handed neutrinos have masses in the ev scale .",
    "even if the light right handed neutrinos decouple before the qcd temperature , they can again be produced at lower temperatures through active - sterile oscillations .",
    "this can again be in tension with the planck bound on the relativistic degrees of freedom . in the scenarios discussed above",
    ", such a situation can occur for the model with particle content shown in table [ tab : data2 ] .",
    "for the particle content in table [ tab : data2 ] , both active - active , sterile - sterile and active - sterile mass terms can appear at one loop level .",
    "similarly , in the lrsm with universal seesaw also , one can have sizeable active - sterile neutrino mixing by suitably choosing @xmath158 in equation .",
    "due to large active - sterile mixing , flavour oscillations will produce the sterile neutrinos at low temperatures making such a scenario highly disfavoured from cosmology .",
    "additional new physics is required to suppress such late production of sterile neutrinos through flavour oscillations @xcite .",
    "the dark matter phenomenology can be very rich if we have a kev scale sterile neutrino along with a stable dark matter candidate with electroweak scale mass or above . as discussed before ,",
    "such a possibility exists in the radiative type ii seesaw model if we want to keep the right handed gauge bosons near the tev corner . in lrsm with universal seesaw , the symmetry breaking scale has to pushed high in order to have kev right handed neutrinos whereas in the radiative type i seesaw model , unnatural fine tuning is required to generate kev scale right handed neutrino masses , similar to the mlrsm . as discussed in @xcite such kev sterile neutrinos with gauge interactions , remain in thermal equilibrium in the early universe and remain like a thermal relic after their freeze - out",
    ". typically , for tev scale masses of these additional gauge bosons , these sterile neutrinos decouple at a low temperature , leading to overproduction .",
    "such an overproduction can be avoided by late time entropy release from the decay of a heavier particle into the sm particles @xcite after the freeze - out of kev sterile neutrino . using these prescriptions",
    ", the authors of @xcite showed that the right handed gauge bosons have to be heavier than 10 tev for correct abundance of kev sterile neutrino dark matter in mlrsm .",
    "later , a more careful study @xcite found a tiny window near @xmath82 mass of 5 tev for which a kev sterile neutrino dark matter of mass @xmath159 kev can give the correct relic abundance .",
    "similar analysis can also be performed within the models discussed in this work .",
    "similarly , the cold dark matter analysis can also be performed in the usual way of calculating relic abundance after freeze - out .",
    "analysis of scalar doublet dark matter in lrsm was recently done by @xcite .",
    "however , due to the mixed dark matter scenario , a careful detailed calculation is required , as the late time entropy release to suppress the wdm abundance will also affect the abundance of cdm .",
    "such a mixed dark matter model can be very interesting from astrophysical structure point of view , as it may provide a way to solve the small scale structure problem @xcite .",
    "this can also be interesting from dark matter experiments point of view as the cold component can provide signatures at gamma ray experiments @xcite whereas the warm component with mass around a few kev can be responsible for the anomalies at x - ray telescopes @xcite .",
    "we have presented a class of left - right symmetric models without the conventional higgs bidoublet that allows the possibility of having light sterile neutrinos along with a cold dark matter candidate stabilised by additional discrete symmetries .",
    "the charged leptons acquire masses through a universal seesaw mechanism due to the presence of additional vector like fermions .",
    "the neutrinos can either acquire masses through the same universal seesaw or through one loop radiative corrections , if suitable particles are added with non - trivial transformations under additional symmetries .",
    "the same additional symmetry can also stabilise one of the particles going inside the loop in neutrino mass diagram , resulting in a stable dark matter candidate . depending on the additional particles and symmetries , the light neutrinos can be either dirac or majorana . in case of dirac light neutrinos ,",
    "the dark sector is composed of only cold dark matter component .",
    "however , in case of majorana light neutrinos , the one or more of the right handed neutrinos can have mass in the ev - kev range without any unnatural fine tuning of the yukawa couplings .",
    "a kev sterile neutrino can be a warm dark matter candidate giving rise to a mixed dark matter scenario along with the cold component . such light right handed neutrinos can have interesting implications for neutrinoless double beta decay and collider experiments , constraining the right handed gauge boson masses .",
    "cosmology constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom also constraints the right handed gauge boson masses to be heavier than a few tev so that the right handed neutrinos get decoupled before the qcd phase transition temperature .",
    "a detailed calculation of the relic abundance of such mixed dark matter scenario is worth investigating and we leave it for a future work .",
