    "magnetic helicity has traditionally been used as a diagnostic tool to characterize magnetic field topology . only in recent years magnetic helicity has also become a useful tool in understanding large scale dynamo action .",
    "magnetic helicity is important because it is conserved in the limit of vanishing resistivity .",
    "this is _ not _ the case with the kinetic helicity , which is also conserved in the inviscid case , but the kinetic helicity dissipation rate diverges in the inviscid limit @xcite . in this sense kinetic helicity",
    "is not even approximately conserved at large reynolds numbers , while magnetic helicity is very nearly conserved at large magnetic reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "a key result that has emerged from the concept of magnetic helicity conservation is that , in a periodic domain , a large scale magnetic field generated by the @xmath0-effect @xcite saturates on a _ resistive _ time scale @xcite .",
    "this time scale can be very long .",
    "the helicity concept has also provided us with a simple explanation for the final saturation field strength of helical dynamos in periodic domains ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . in this light",
    ", the case with an imposed magnetic field has also been considered @xcite , where it was found that above a certain field strength the dynamo is suppressed .    in the present paper",
    "we use similar ideas to obtain a more detailed understanding of the case with an imposed field .",
    "we begin with the equation governing the evolution of the magnetic helicity in a periodic domain in the presence of an imposed field .",
    "it is well known that in that case the magnetic helicity of the fluctuating magnetic field is no longer conserved in the nonresistive limit @xcite , but we also point out that a certain generalized ( or total ) magnetic helicity that has sometimes been used instead is gauge dependent and can therefore not be used in the present case .",
    "we then discuss applications of the magnetic helicity equation to the alpha - effect in mean - field electrodynamics and derive a model equation in order to understand the evolution of the magnetic helicity for different imposed field strengths .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field @xmath1 is governed by @xmath2 where the electric field is obtained from ohm s law , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the velocity , @xmath5 the current density , and @xmath6 the resistivity . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt si units , but we set the permeability to unity .",
    "we consider all quantities to be triply - periodic over a cartesian domain .",
    "we consider the case with a finite mean field , @xmath7 where angular brackets denote full volume averages .",
    "such averages have no spatial dependence , but they can still depend on time .",
    "however , because of periodicity , the volume average of the curl in eq .",
    "( [ dbbdt ] ) vanishes , and hence @xmath8 . in other words",
    ", @xmath9 is not only constant in space , but it is also constant in time .",
    "next , we split the field into a mean and a fluctuating component , @xmath10 , and introduce the magnetic vector potential for the fluctuating component via @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is periodic .",
    "the uncurled induction equation reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scalar potential .",
    "we now consider the magnetic helicity .",
    "the imposed field is constant in space and does therefore not contribute to the magnetic helicity .",
    "we therefore consider only the magnetic helicity of the fluctuating field , @xmath15 .",
    "this quantity is gauge invariant because adding a gradient term to @xmath12 does not change @xmath16 : @xmath17 here we have used the solenoidality of @xmath18 , and the fact that the volume average over a divergence term vanishes for a periodic domain .",
    "the equation for the ( gauge - dependent ) helicity density of the fluctuating field can be obtained in the form @xmath19 . \\label{heldensity}\\ ] ] the divergence term vanishes after volume averaging , so @xmath20 where all terms are gauge - independent .",

    "if the flow is isotropic and helical , there will be an @xmath0-effect @xcite with @xmath25 , so @xmath26 ( in appendix  [ displacementcurrentimposed ] we clarify the implications of a finite @xmath0 effect when the faraday displacement current is restored in the maxwell equations and when it is ignored . )",
    "since @xmath27 is gauge invariant , it is a physically meaningful quantity . if there is a steady state , then @xmath27 must also be steady . in that case",

    "@xmath0-effect means that the structure of eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) is very different when there is an imposed field . unlike the case",
    "without imposed field ( @xmath29 ) , the quantity @xmath15 is no longer conserved in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "this prompted matthaeus & goldstein @xcite to consider the quantity @xmath31 where @xmath32 note that @xmath33 is constructed such that it satisfies the equation @xmath34 indeed , this equation reduces to eq .",

    "the symbol @xmath35 is chosen to make the extra term in eq .",
    "( [ hhat ] ) look like a magnetic helicity , even though @xmath36 .",
    "the reason for @xmath37 is that @xmath35 corresponds to a slowly varying variable , whose curl gives @xmath9 at a _ higher _ order , and not the order we are working in ; see eq .",

    "one may be tempted to conclude that in the steady state , @xmath38 .",
    "this is not generally true , however , and it would be in conflict with eqs  ( [ helicity_eqn ] ) and  ( [ alpha ] ) . certainly for sufficiently weak fields @xmath0 is finite @xcite , so @xmath39 will also remain finite , see eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 can not be constant in the steady state .",
    "the reason for this puzzle is that @xmath33 is not gauge invariant @xcite , because the definition of @xmath33 involves the quantity @xmath35 . at first glance",

    "we emphasize however that @xmath15 is still gauge invariant and therefore physically meaningful , even though it is no longer a conserved quantity in the ideal limit .",
    "in this section we want to comment on the related issue that adding a spatially constant vector @xmath44 to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dadt ] ) would not affect the evolution of @xmath18 .",
    "the constant vector @xmath44 can readily be absorbed in the definition of the scalar potential @xmath14 , because it is specified only up to an additional gauge potential .",

    "( [ dadt ] ) must have an additional component that varies _ linearly _ in space , i.e.@xmath45 where @xmath46 is periodic and @xmath47 is the position vector .",
    "we stress that @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) is therefore in general not periodic , even if @xmath12 and @xmath18 are periodic .",
    "a comment on the helicity flux associated with the gauge field is here in order .",
    "this flux is often written as @xmath48 which would then not be periodic and hence it is not obvious that its surface integral vanishes ; see eqs  ( [ heldensity ] ) and  ( [ heldensityaver ] ) .",
    "( the importance of this term for magnetic helicity injection has been discussed in ref .",
    "however , using the identity @xmath49 the magnetic helicity flux @xmath48 can also be written as @xmath50 , which is periodic .",
    "therefore , there is no contribution from the @xmath48 term in our case .",
    "( we note that similar manipulations can be used to turn a non - periodic vector potential into a periodic one if the velocity is a linear function of coordinates @xcite . )",
    "the term @xmath51 has recently been discussed in a formulation of a magnetic helicity conserving dynamo effect @xcite .",
    "obviously , such a term does not give a contribution under the divergence and hence can not be physically meaningful @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of simulations of helically forced periodic flows with an imposed magnetic field .",

    "recently , the effect of an imposed field on the inverse cascade has been studied @xcite .",
    "if the imposed magnetic field is weak or absent , there is a strong nonlocal transfer of magnetic helicity and magnetic energy from the forcing scale to larger scales .",
