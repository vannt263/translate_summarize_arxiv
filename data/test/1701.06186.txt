    "quantum fluctuations give rise to numerous fascinating physical effects , especially on sub - micrometer scales . some of these phenomena have been extensively studied and carefully measured , thus demonstrating their relevance for both fundamental physics and future technologies @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in fluctuation - induced interactions in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "a prominent example is quantum friction @xcite , the quantum drag force between two uncharged , polarizable objects in relative motion .",
    "a large part of the existing literature on quantum friction considers an atom ( or some other microscopic object ) moving in front of a flat surface , where the corresponding material is modeled using local optics , i.e. assuming a spatially local material whose electric permittivity only depends on frequency @xcite . within the assumption of local optics ,",
    "several conceptual questions have been addressed in the literature , including the functional dependence of the frictional force on the atom s velocity @xcite , the impact of non - markovian effects @xcite , and even the relevance of nonequilibrium correlations @xcite .    at short distances from the surface , however , a local description of the material becomes inadequate .",
    "earlier works @xcite have already shown that spatial dispersion can lead to corrections to equilibrium dispersion forces . also , in the case of surface - surface quantum friction ,",
    "different material models that include spatial dispersion have been used to describe the drag force @xcite .",
    "the authors of these works have demonstrated that for short distances spatial nonlocality can lead to an enhancement of the force relative to the case of a local material model @xcite .",
    "these works , however , have resorted to the so - called local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) approximation , where it is assumed that the subsystems in relative motion are at equilibrium with their immediate surroundings .",
    "such a procedure allows to utilize results of equilibrium thermodynamics , like the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , but neglects the contribution due to nonequilibrium correlations @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent work has shown that the lte approximation is not well justified for atom - surface quantum friction and underestimates the magnitude of the drag force @xcite .",
    "since the lte approximation relies on a short correlation length of the fluctuations that mediate the interaction , one can expect that , when spatial dispersion is taken into account , the deviation from the lte result is even larger than in the local optics treatment .    in this work , we study effects of spatial dispersion in atom - surface quantum friction and compare the results obtained using the lte approximation with those obtained using a full nonequilibrium approach . we show that spatial dispersion enhances the failure of the lte approximation , resulting in a 95% deviation from the full nonequilibrium result compared to the 80% deviation previously reported within local optics @xcite .",
    "in addition , we show that the inclusion of spatial nonlocality strongly affects the functional distance dependence of the frictional force in the low - velocity limit .",
    "in contrast to the local optics case , where both the lte and the full nonequilibrium approach predict the same distance scaling law for the quantum frictional force , their distance behaviors are different in the presence of spatial dispersion .",
    "consider an atom driven by an external force and moving with non - relativistic velocity ( @xmath0 ) at constant height @xmath1 parallel to a conducting isotropic half - space .",
    "the atom is modeled as an electric dipole , described by the quantum operator @xmath2 . due to the interaction of the atom with the surrounding quantum electromagnetic field",
    "a drag force will progressively balance the external drive until the system reaches a nonequilibrium steady state , where the motion continues with constant velocity .",
    "dissipation in the material gives rise to a nonzero memory time , such that in the nonequilibrium steady state we can ignore the transient acceleration process and assume that the atom has reached the trajectory @xmath3 @xcite ( we assume that the motion is along the @xmath4-direction ) . in earlier work @xcite , we have shown that the zero - temperature drag force felt by the atom in such a situation can be written as @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the parallel component of the three - dimensional electromagnetic wave vector @xmath7 @xcite . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the frictional force is only along the direction of the motion , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "quantum friction is determined by the velocity - dependent nonequilibrium power spectrum tensor of the dipole fluctuations , @xmath9 , and by the fourier transform ( in time and @xmath10-direction ) of the electromagnetic surface green tensor , @xmath11 . in eq .",
    "and in the remainder of the paper the subscript @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the real ( imaginary ) part of an expression and the superscript @xmath14 gives the symmetric part of a tensor @xcite .",
    "the green tensor is given by the sum of a vacuum contribution @xmath15 and a scattering contribution @xmath16 .",
    "because of lorentz invariance , only the latter contributes to the final result @xcite . in all this work we focus on atom - surface distances within the surface s near - field region . in this case",

    "the description of the material properties enters via the transverse magnetic reflection coefficient , @xmath19 , which in general depends on both the frequency and , for symmetry reasons , the modulus of the wavevector @xmath20 . in a spatially local description of the material and in the near - field limit",
    ", the dependence on the wave vector disappears and the reflection coefficient is only a function of frequency @xcite .    in order to calculate the nonequilibrium power spectrum , we model the dipole s internal dynamics as a harmonic oscillator @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the oscillator s frequency , @xmath23 is the electric field , and @xmath24 is the static polarizability tensor , assumed to be symmetric for simplicity ( it is proportional to a projector parallel to the direction of the dipole moment ) .",

    "previous works @xcite have shown that the quantum frictional process is characterized by a non - resonant and a resonant contribution , both being a function of the atomic velocity and the atom s separation from the surface . the resonant part occurs for sufficiently high velocities which bring the atomic transition frequency within the range of the surface plasmon - polariton resonances that exist at the vacuum / material interface . here , we consider only the non - resonant part of the frictional force which takes place at lower velocities and is more likely to play a central role in typical experimental setups . in appendix [ low - velocity ]",
    "we show that the main contribution to the force comes from the frequency range @xmath34 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , at sufficiently low velocities @xcite the drag force is determined by the low - frequency behavior of the material s electromagnetic response . under the assumption that the material is ohmic for these low frequencies ( we will see below that this applies to our nonlocal model )",

    "we describe the properties of a metallic surface using the so - called semi - classical infinite barrier ( scib ) model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "electrons are treated as a fermi fluid whose dynamics is governed by the boltzmann equation . at interfaces , electrons are assumed to be specularly reflected by an infinite potential barrier @xcite .",
    "although more sophisticated models are available ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the scib model takes into account important phenomena , such as landau damping @xcite , which are absent in simpler nonlocal models ( e.g. the hydrodynamic model ) @xcite .",

    "since quantum friction is very sensitive to any form of dissipation present in the system @xcite , this intrinsic damping due to the exchange of energy between the electronic wave function and the radiation @xcite will play an important role in our analysis .    within the scib model , the reflection coefficient takes the form @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the transverse magnetic surface impedance and @xmath53 is the corresponding vacuum value . in the non - retarded limit",
