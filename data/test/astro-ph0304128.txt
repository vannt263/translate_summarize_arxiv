    "seyfert 2 galaxies ( where only narrow emission lines are visible ) are commonly believed to be intrinsically the same as seyfert 1 galaxies ( where both narrow and broad emission lines are visible ) , the difference being due to orientation . according to the widely accepted unification model for agns ( antonucci , 1993 ) type 2 agns are seen edge - on , through large columns of circumnuclear obscuring material that prevents the direct view of the nucleus , including the broad line regions ( blrs ) .",
    "this scenario was first proposed by antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) to explain the presence of polarized broad lines in the archetypical seyfert 2 , ngc 1068 , and is now supported other than by spectropolarimetric observations of hidden broad line regions ( hblrs ) in several other sources , also by x  ray observations , which demonstrate that seyfert 2s have usually absorption columns largely exceeding the galactic ones .    despite observations do generally support orientation based unification models for agns ,",
    "exceptions do exist .",
    "only about 50 % of the brightest seyfert 2s show the presence of hblrs ( tran , 2001 ) in their polarized optical spectra , while the remaining half do not .",
    "it has now been convincingly shown that the presence or absence of hblrs in seyfert 2s depends on the agn luminosity , with the hblr sources having on average larger luminosities ( lumsden & alexander 2001 ; gu & huang 2002 ; martocchia & matt 2002 ; tran 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "while lumsden & alexander ( 2001 ) explained this finding still in the framework of an orientation model , tran ( 2001 ) proposed the existence of a population of galactic nuclei whose activity is powered by starburst rather than accretion onto a supermassive black hole and in which therefore the blrs simply do not exist .    in this paper",
    "we present evidence that suggests that the absence or presence of hblrs is regulated by the ratio between the x - ray luminosity and the eddington luminosity which , in the accretion  power scenario , is a measure of the rate at which matter accretes onto the central supermassive black hole .",
    "our explanation is based on the model proposed by nicastro ( 2000 , hereinafter n00 ) , in which the blrs are formed by accretion disk instabilities occurring in proximity of the critical radius at which the disk changes from gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated .",
    "this radius diminishes with decreasing @xmath2 ; for low enough accretion rates ( and therefore luminosities ) , the critical radius becomes smaller than the innermost stable orbit , and blrs can not form . under the keplerian assumption ,",
    "the model naturally predicts that agns that are accreting close to the lowest possible @xmath2 must show the broadest possible emission lines in their optical spectra , either hidden ( i.e. in polarimetric light ) , if the nucleus is obscured , or not , if the nucleus is not obscured .",
    "an analogous model has been proposed recently by laor ( 2003 ) . in both nicastro and laor s models",
    "the existence of blrs in agn is related to the breadth of the broad emission lines ( bels ) , and based on the observed upper limit of @xmath3 for the bels . however , while in nicastro s ( 2000 ) model this a consequence of the lines been produced in clouds of gas located at a distance from the source depending on the accretion rate in eddington units ( so the accretion rate is the physical driver of the observed correlation ) , in laor s model the driving parameter is the width of the line itself , and no physical origin is proposed ( other than the observed correlation between agn luminosity and line width ) .    to check this hypothesis and",
    "test the above models , we extracted from the tran ( 2001 ) spectropolarimetric sample , the subsample of type 2 agns that also have good quality x - ray spectra available ( see martocchia & matt 2002 ) .",
    "most of the sources in our sample have [ o iii ] luminosities much lower than @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 . at such relatively low luminosities , stellar light from the galaxy",
    "may be a strong contaminant in the optical band .",
    "x  ray luminosities , instead , are little or not contaminated by stellar components and so are possibly more reliable indicators of the nuclear , accretion - powered activity . for each source of our sample",
    ", we then estimate its 2 - 10 kev intrinsic ( i.e. unabsorbed ) luminosity , and use it as a reliable measure of the nuclear activity .",
    "we then estimate the mass of the black hole , using the relation between the mass and the bulge luminosity ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merrit 2000 ) . comparing the black hole mass and the x - ray luminosity ,",
    "the accretion rate is eventually derived .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we define and discuss the adopted sample and the methods used to derive the various parameters . in sec .",
    "3 the results of our analysis are presented , and discussed in sec .",
    "4 .    throughout this paper a value of @xmath6=70 km",
    "s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 is adopted .",
    "we extracted our primary sample from the spectropolarimetric survey of tran ( 2001 ; see also tran 2003 ) of all , optically classified , seyfert 2 galaxies in the cfa and 12@xmath7 samples .",
    "optical polarized spectra of the sources in this survey are rather homogeneous in signal - to - noise ( tran , 2001 ) , so the lack of polarized broad lines in the optical spectra of about half of the sources in the sample should not be an artifact of dramatic differences in data quality .",
    "first we searched for the x - ray properties of the sample [ namely ( a ) the intrinsic 2 - 10 kev flux , and ( b ) the equivalent hydrogen column density @xmath8 , and selected only those sources that had been observed at least once with imaging x - ray satellites .",
    "this allowed us to minimize confusion problems which , at the typical flux level of our sample , may be relevant ( georgantopoulos & zezas , 2003 ) . in practice , we used data only from asca , _ beppo_sax , _ chandra _ and xmm_newton _ , either taken from literature , when available and reliable , or ( re)analyzed by ourselves . finally , we applied two further selections , discarding ( a ) all sources suspected to be compton ",
    "thick , and ( b ) sources known to be strongly variable , in x - rays , on time scales of years ( e.g. ngc 7172 , dadina et al .",
    "2001 ) . for compton ",
    "thick sources no direct measurements of the intrinsic luminosity is available , while highly variable sources can not be assigned univocally a x - ray luminosity .",
    "additional details on our primary sample selection can be found in martocchia & matt ( 2002 ) .",
    "we ended up with a small but reliable sample consisting of 10 hblr and 6 non - hblr sources .",
    "previous works ( gu & huang , 2002 , martocchia & matt , 2002 , tran , 2003 ) have shown that all hblr sources have 2 - 10 kev luminosities larger than @xmath9 erg s@xmath5 , while all non - hblr sources have luminosities smaller than this value . no correlation with the column density of the absorber is , instead , found .",
    "the x  ray luminosity is clearly correlated with the [ o iii ] luminosity ( even if with a large scatter ) , confirming the reliability of the estimates .    for the 16 sources in our primary sample , we then tried to estimate the nuclear accretion rate , in units of eddington . to calculate @xmath2",
    ", we needed to evaluate the mass of the central black hole , which we derived using the ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) empirical relationship between nuclear mass and bulge luminosity ( we used the numerical coefficients they derived from their sample a ) .",
    "the bulge luminosity @xmath10 was derived from the empirical correlation between the galaxy s morphological type ( i.e. t - type ) and the bulge to total luminosity ratio given by simien & de vaucouleurs ( 1986)-@xmath11 correlation is more tight than the @xmath12-@xmath10 correlation , as discussed in detail by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , for only 4 sources ( three of them hblr ) in our sample we could find measured nuclear velocity dispersions ( only 2 more can be added , both hblr , considering all sources in the gu & huang 2002 compilation ) . moreover , sometimes the reported values differ significantly , with dramatic effects on the estimate of the mass , even of an order of magnitude . for these reasons",
    "we were forced to use the @xmath12-@xmath10 relationship , despite its larger scattering . ] .",
    "the ( corrected for extinction ) total luminosity and t - type were taken from the rc3 catalog ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the complete information was available only for a subset of our primary sample .",
    "this further selection reduced then our final primary sample to a total of 10 sources : 6 hblrs and 4 non - hblrs .    for completeness , and given the limited size of our final primary sample",
    ", we also considered a secondary sample , derived applying the same criteria and rules used to select our primary sample to the gu & huang ( 2002 ) compilation .",
    "this compilation contains all seyfert 2s with published ( between 1995 and 2002 ) spectropolarimetric information , and therefore is not as homogeneous as the tran ( 2001 ) sample in the quality of the polarized optical spectra .",
    "this search added 3 more hblrs and 2 more non - hblrs to our final sample .",
    "for all sources in our final sample we calculated the accretion rate in eddington units ( actually the ratio between the nuclear bolometric luminosity @xmath13 and the eddington luminosity @xmath14 ) assuming a factor 10 correction between the 2 - 10 kev and bolometric luminosities ( see footnote 5 in  3 ) .",
    "results are summarized in table  [ lmdot ] ( for the sources of our secondary sample luminosities are slightly different from those reported by gu & huang , 2002 , because of the different choice of h@xmath15 ) .",

    "it has been recently shown ( gu & huang , 2002 , martocchia & matt , 2002 , tran , 2003 ) that the intrinsic agn luminosity of the sources of the tran ( 2001 ) sample can be used to clearly separate the two classes of hblr and non - hblr sources .",
    "sources with 2 - 10 kev luminosities larger than the threshold value of @xmath21 erg s@xmath5 do show hbls in their optical polarized spectra , while sources with @xmath22 do not ( see figure 1 of martocchia & matt , 2002 ) .",
    "here we provide evidence that suggests that this separation is due to differences in nuclear accretion rate , from hblr to non - hblr sources .",
    "figure 1 shows fractional luminosities in units of eddington luminosities , versus black hole masses for all the 15 sources of our primary ( circles ) and secondary ( squares ) samples .",
    "open symbols in this plot represent hblr sources , while filled symbols represent non - hblr sources .",
    "we first note that a very broad range of accretion rates is spanned by the sources of our sample ( more than three orders of magnitude ) , which are otherwise powered by central black holes with rather homogeneous masses ( only a factor of about 15 across the entire sample ) .",
    "most importantly , figure 1 clearly shows that hblr sources are accreting at much faster rates compared to non - hblr sources . .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath0 divides up hblr from non - hblr sources in the @xmath12 vs @xmath2 plane ( dashed vertical line in fig .",
    "1 ) . the only exceptions are ngc  3081 and ngc  3281 , both sources from our `` secondary '' sample .",
    "ngc  3081 is a hblr source , with an accretion rate of @xmath23 , a factor of @xmath24 below the threshold value , while ngc  3281 is a non - hblr source accreting at a rate of @xmath25 , again a factor of 2 , but above the threshold .",
    "we looked at these two exceptions in somewhat higher detail .",
    "the flux of ngc  3081 reported in gu & huang ( 2002 ) is taken from maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ; bepposax data ) .",
    "we reanalyzed those data and found very similar results .",
    "however , the spectral parameters are very poorly constrained . if the power law index is fixed to 2 ( instead of the value of 1.7 chosen by maiolino et al .",
    "1998 ) , an almost equally good fit is found , but the inferred luminosity ( and then @xmath2 ) is twice as large . ] , moving the source to the right side of our @xmath2 vs @xmath26 plane , and so supporting our main conclusion .",
    "the x  ray luminosity reported by gu & huang ( 2002 ) for the second exception in our sample , the non - hblr source ngc  3281 , is based on an asca observation ( bassani et al .",
    "1999 ) , and is underestimated by a factor @xmath273 . a subsequent bepposax observation , in fact , demonstrated that the source is actually moderately compton  thick ( vignali & comastri , 2002 ) , which implies a higher intrinsic luminosity .",
    "this , in turn , implies a higher accretion rate compared to that reported in table 1 , and then amplify , rather than moderate , the discrepancy found .",
    "however , for this source we could not find in the literature details on the spectropolarimetric observation , so it is impossible to judge how significant is the upper limit on the presence of polarized broad lines .",
    "we have presented evidence for a correlation between the presence of hbls in the polarized optical spectra of nearby seyfert 2s , and their nuclear accretion rate .",
    "virtually all sources with hblrs are found above the threshold value of @xmath28 , in the @xmath2 vs @xmath26 plane , and viceversa .",
    "our sample is admittedly small , but both the spectropolarimetric observations ( at least for the sources of our primary sample ) and the x  ray luminosities are quite reliable .",
    "it should be also noted that the many sources of uncertainties in our @xmath2 estimates [ namely ( a ) the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio vs t type , ( b ) the black hole mass to bulge luminosity correlation , and ( c ) the bolometric correction ] , would likely destroy , certainly not artificially create , the observed correlation .",
    "our findings fit nicely with predictions of the model of n00 , in which the blrs originate from the accretion disk at the transition radius between the gas pressure and radiation pressure dominated regions .",
    "this suggests that the accretion rate ( n00 ) , rather than the `` line - width '' ( laor , 2003 ) is indeed the parameter physically responsible for the presence or not of blrs in agn .",
    "it is remarkable that the threshold value of @xmath29 that we find is so close to what predicted in the framework of the n00 model ( i.e. about 4@xmath30 for a black hole mass of 10@xmath31m@xmath18 ) .",
    "the threshold value @xmath32 , however , is almost independent of the spin of the black hole , and so , unfortunately , this model can not be used to discriminate between spinning and non - spinning black holes .",
    "this is because in the n00 model the critical radius at which the blr should form decreases with increasing radiative efficiency in the disk and this decrease is almost exactly balanced by the decrease of the radius of the last stable orbit .    of course",
    ", if our explanation is correct , a fraction ( set by the relative number of type 1 to type 2 seyferts in the nearby universe ) of the non - hblrs should be actually not obscured . in the gu & huang ( 2002 ) compilation ,",
    "4 out of the 23 non - hblr sources with x - ray information available ( i.e. 17 % ) show little ( @xmath33 @xmath34 ) cold x - ray absorption . in the martocchia & matt ( 2002 )",
    "sample ( i.e. our primary sample , before the bulge luminosity estimate selection ) 1 out of the 6 non - hblr sources ( again , 17 % ) has an estimated column density only a factor of about 3 larger than the galactic column along that line of sight . in our final sample only one object ( ngc  7590 , extracted from the gu & huang , 2002 , compilation ) is virtually unabsorbed . our estimate of the accretion rate for this objects could then in principle be affected by the agn light in this source , which would artificially increase the total galaxy luminosity ( the observed parameter we use ) , and so the bulge one .",
    "however , the 2 - 10 kev luminosity of this source is very low ( see table 1 ) and so presumably is its b band luminosity .",
    "the effect on the estimate of @xmath2 , in this case , should therefore be small .",
    "though suggestive of the existence of a population of unobscured ( i.e. type 1 ) non - hblr sources , the current statistics is too poor to draw any firm conclusion .",
    "moreover current estimates of equivalent h column densities are based on x - ray observations taken with satellites with poor spatial resolutions ( mostly rosat , asca and _ beppo_sax ) . at such low luminosities ,",
    "a single spatially unresolved luminous x - ray binary , or a population of those , could lead to underestimate the column of matter actually absorbing the nuclear light ( georgantopoulos , & zezas , 2003 ) .",
    "better ( i.e. higher spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ) and more numerous x - ray data are required to disentangle this issue . enlarging the sample of low luminosity supposedly type 2 agns with both good quality optical spectropolarimetric and x - ray ( i.e. _ chandra",
    "_ and/or xmm_newton _ ) data , would allow us to eventually find a sub - population of non - hblr sources , with none or little cold x - ray absorption",
    ". these would be the genuine type 1 counterparts of the low accretion rate non - hblr `` true '' type 2 sources of our current sample .",
    "this population should fall on the left side ( @xmath35 ) of the @xmath2 vs @xmath12 plane ( see also laor , 2003 ) .",
    "we note that , recently , few examples of this class of low - accretion rate type 1 agns may have actually been discovered in x - rays ( i.e. pappa et al .",
    ", 2001 , georgantopoulos , & zezas , 2003 , boller et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the asca and _ chandra _ spectra of the optically classified seyfert 2 ngc  4698 , shows little or no absorption ( pappa et al . , 2001 ,",
    "georgantopoulos , & zezas , 2003 ) .",
    "the estimated accretion rate for the central agn in this galaxy is lower than @xmath36 ( georgantopoulos , & zezas , 2003 ) , consistent with our proposed scenario .",
    "similarly rosat and _ chandra _ spectra of 1es  1927 + 654 shows an unobscured , highly variable steep power law continuum , typical of narrow line seyfert 1s ( boller et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "this object has been recently re - classified as a seyfert 2 based on its optical spectrum ( bauer et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "1es  1927 + 654 has an optical ( b - band ) luminosity of @xmath37 erg s@xmath38 , but no mass estimate is available for its central black hole , and so for the accretion rate in eddington units .",
    "however , given the overall x - ray properties of this object ( i.e. steep spectrum and large amplitude variability ) , we speculate that 1es  1927 + 654 is actually accreting at very high rates , in terms of eddington , and belongs then to the opposite extreme of the line - width vs accretion rate correlation in the framework of the n00 model .",
    "if this is the case , 1es  1927 + 654 would actually be an optically mis - identified narrow line seyfert 1 .",
    "the two objects described above have no spectropolarimetric observation , so we do not know whether they have a hblr or not .",
    "our findings are based on x - ray luminosities and black hole masses derived from the mass - to - bulge luminosity relation .",
    "it is interesting to note that gu & huang ( 2002 ) , also find a similar accretion - rate versus hblr - existence correlation ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) , using [ o iii ] ( rather than x - ray ) luminosities and black hole masses obtained from the m@xmath39-@xmath11 correlation .    the results presented here support the n00 model , and suggest therefore that the accretion rate is the physical driver of the observed bimodal distribution of hblr and non - hblr sources with luminosities . while other explanations ( see e.g. lumsden & alexander 2001 ; tran 2001 , 2003 , martocchia & matt , 2002 , gu & huang , 2002 ) can not at present be ruled out , the results presented here are very encouraging , and worth checking more throughly by enlarging the sample with new spectropolarimetric and/or x  ray observations .",
