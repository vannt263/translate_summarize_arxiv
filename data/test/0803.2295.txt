    "images formed in the strong gravitational regime are very sensitive to the local variations of the lens deflection field . in a circular potential the caustic is reduced to a single point and the image of a source in a singular situation is a circle . when ellipticity is introduced , the caustic system is a serie of connected lines with typical diamond shape aspect .",

    "is shifted to the sub - critical regime by the substructure field .",
    "an interesting point is that this sub - critical regime is quite different from the regime observed for the purely elliptical lens .",
    "the main feature of the sub - critical regime for perturbed elliptical lens is that the image situated at shorter distance from the substructure is much more perturbed than the others .",
    "thus by comparing the structure of the images it is generally possible to detect the anomaly induced by the perturbator .",
    "the most obvious features of the perturbed image will be related to the properties of the function s @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see fig.s  [ plot2 ] and  [ plot3 ] ) . in particular the function s presents large values of the slope ( @xmath1 ) , or large curvature ( @xmath0 ) near the origin . for smaller images the local slope",
    "is directly related to the image size , thus the perturbation will reduce the size of the image . for instance",
    "let s consider the following sub - critical configurations , ( i ) : a source at mid - distance from the caustic in an elliptical potential , ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , and ( ii ) : the same system , but with the additional deflection field of a substructure with position angle aligned with the potential axis . in case ( i )",
    "the sub - critical regime breaks the arcs in 3 small images , the central image ( @xmath51 ) , and 2 symmetrical images . for circular sources and a local linear approximation of the field",
    "the size of the images is directly proportional to the inverse of the local derivative of @xmath1 .",

    "10 ) . using the former formula for @xmath1",
    "some simple calculations shows that the ratio of the size of the central @xmath16 image to the size of the other images @xmath53 is : @xmath54 eq .",
    "(  [ size_ratio ] ) shows that for sub - critical regime , @xmath55 , thus @xmath56 consequently , the central image is larger that the two other symmetrical images , which is an important feature of the sub - critical regime for elliptical lens . with a substructure",
    ", the slope near the origin of @xmath1 is perturbed by an additional field with slope at origin @xmath57 ( see sec .",
    "2.2 ) . in the hypothesis of a local perturbation",
    "the 2 other images remain unperturbed . assuming @xmath58 the size of the central image is now : @xmath59 the scale of @xmath60 in the caustic system is @xmath44 , thus eq.s (  [ size_ratio_pert ] ) indicates that the image ratio is modified by : @xmath61 thus the perturbation is significant if at least , @xmath62 .",
    "since the usual scale of both @xmath44 and @xmath15 is of about one tenth of @xmath63 , @xmath11 must be of only the order of a percent to alter very significantly the size of the central image .",
    "this section will show that the image anomalies due to substructures can be reconstructed independantly of the source shape .",
    "the reconstruction will be illustrated by the configuration presented in sec .",
    "4.1 . in this configuration",
    ", the distortion is very obvious , because most of the effect is on the central image , and that the size of this image is reduced by the field of the substructure .",
    "however this results holds for source with circular contours only . for other sources the size of the images",
    "may be modified slightly , and for better accuracy a more general approach is required .",
    "here we have to tackle the general problem of lensing potential and source reconstruction , taken together these problem are difficult and may be quite degenerate .",
    "the problem in itself is much simplified if we make the hypothesis that the field is smooth at the scale of the image and can be represented by a lower order polynomial in @xmath64 .",
    "the knowledge of the field at the images positions allows to transfer the image contours to the source plane , where the different images of the sources must be identical .",
    "the constraint that the image must be identical in the source plane will be used to evaluate the field at the image position .",
    "another constraint on lens reconstruction is that no images are produced in void areas ( diego _ et al . _ ) .",
    "this constraint is simple to implement in the perturbative approach , it is sufficient that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the radius of a circular envelope to the source contour .",
    "there are basically two kind of image models to consider , smaller images , with nearly linear field at the scale of the image , and the longer images produced in near caustics configurations . for smaller images ,",
    "the model to adopt for the @xmath28 field is very obvious , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 a local constant to evaluate , and @xmath69 a position angle which in practice should be close to the image center . near caustics",
    "the model should be a polynomial of higher order . for the @xmath0 field",
    "the situation is similar to the @xmath28 field for small images , while in near caustics situations the local modelisation of the @xmath0 field will require a full polynomial expansion to higher order ( 2 or 3 ) .",
    "simulated data are obtained by ray - tracing the lens model in the sub - critical configuration described in sec . 4.2 .",
    "the ellipticity of the lens is @xmath70 , and the substructure parameters are : , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the source position is @xmath74 , @xmath50 .",
    "the fitting procedure is greatly simplified by the fact that in the perturbative approach the solution for a circular source is known ( alard 2007 ) . for circular source",
    "the @xmath0 field corresponds to the mean radial position of the contour at a given @xmath64 , and the @xmath1 field is the contour width .",
    "once these fields are extracted from the images data , they make a good starting guess for the real solution . basically the guess will be estimated by fitting local polynomial expansions of @xmath64 to the circular solution .",
    "starting from this guess a few steps of non - linear fitting optimization will lead to the correct solution .",
    "the quantity to minimize to achieve an estimate of the solution will be a measurement of the image similarity when a re - mapping to the source plane is performed . a general method to estimate",
    "the image similarity is to compare their moments .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath75 images , and that their moments to order @xmath76 in the source plane are identical , this provide @xmath77 constraints .",
    "local linear image models have @xmath78 parameters , thus even in the case of 2 images only the problem is already over - constrained for @xmath79 . in the case presented in fig s (  [ plot6 ] ) , (  [ plot7 ] ) and (  [ plot8 ] ) , there are 4 images , thus moments up to the second order are sufficient to fit the data .",
    "ray tracing of the sub - critical configuration presented in section 4.2 is performed for different sources shape , resulting in 3 different sets of 4 images .",
    "local linear field models are fitted to each of these sets .",
    "the circular solution is used as a first guess and a quantity that measures the distance between the image moments in the source plane is minimized using the simplex method . in each case",
    "both the field parameters and source shape can be recovered ( see table  [ res ] ) .",
    "the great advantage of the local field method , is that even for the higher order fields generated by a substructure , the local models are simple and can be recovered .",
    "note also that for instance the slope of @xmath1 gives 4 constraints , which coupled with the image positions gives 8 constraints . in the case of an elliptical lens",
    "the fourier expansion is of order 2 ( provided ellipticity is not too large ) , which corresponds to 4 parameters only .",
    "thus the elliptical case is over - constrained in the present situation . with only 2 images",
    "the elliptical lens is already constrained .",
    "taking any 2 images unperturbed by the substructure , and making an elliptical model , it will always be impossible for this model to meet the constraint related to the perturbed image .",
    ".local model fitting results for different sources , first circular source with diameter @xmath80 , elliptical source with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath80 , two circular sources with diameter @xmath80 and respective centers : ( @xmath83,0 ) , ( @xmath84,0 ) . for comparison , in the last column of the first part of the table ,",
    "the theoretical results of the local field values are given when no substructure is present ( see the large difference on the slope of image 2 ) .",
    "it is not presented for the second part , since due to symmetry of the substructure position it has no effect on the @xmath0 field . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        in table 1 the perturbation on the local slope of the @xmath1 function due to the substructure is about 7 times the mean scatter of the measurements recovered by fitting local models for the different sources . translated in accuracy on the measurement of the substructure mass",
    "gives about 0.4 % of the main halo mass .",
    "however the scatter in the measurements comes from the perturbative approximation and also from the simplicity of the local ( linear ) modeling .",
    "thus this scatter is an over - estimate of the error made in the perturbative approximation .",
    "the perturbative method may introduce some limitation in accuracy , but in practice , resolution effects and noise should be much stronger limiting factors . and more importantly , the limit in accuracy by the perturbative method may be a concern only for absolute measurement of the displacement field of the lens , if we are interested in the differential effect of the substructure field , then the perturbative method will be very accurate , first because the method is linear , and thus allows differential measurements , and second because also due to linearity , the field of the perturbator can be reconstructed with an accuracy that scales likes its mass . thus , for the evaluation of the differential effects due to very small substructure the perturbative method should give accurate results , in this case , the main problem will be related to the un - biased statistical estimation of the perturbative fields for distributions without substructure",
    ".      in general the image features are dependent upon the source shape , and the re - construction of the lens fields require the non - linear procedure presented in the former section .",
    "however , for smaller images and weakly elliptical sources , there is an approximate invariant .",
    "this conserved quantity is useful for nearly round sources , or for improving the first guess in the non linear fitting procedure .",
    "let s consider small images with total size @xmath85 and an elliptical source , the width of the image is given by eq .",
    "( 15 ) in alard ( 2007 ) : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the source ellipticity and @xmath88 is the angle of the source main axis .",
    "since the image is supposed to be small , we are operating in a small range of @xmath64 , and the field @xmath89 may be linearized locally . near the center of the image , @xmath90 ,",
    "thus by taking the origin of @xmath64 at the image center we have : @xmath91 .",
    "we will also assume that the ellipticity is a small number , so that by change of variable @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . using these new variables , it is possible to expand eq .",
    "(  [ width ] ) in series of @xmath94 , which simplifies the calculation of many quantities . .",
    "in particular , the image size along the orthoradial direction is obtained by the condition @xmath95 . solving to the lowest order in @xmath94",
    ", we obtain a second order equation in @xmath64 , and the difference of the 2 roots gives the image size . to the lowest order in @xmath94 , the image size in the orthoradial direction is @xmath96 : @xmath97 the size of the image in the other direction is approximately the size of the image in the radial direction near the center of the image , from eq .",
    "(  /refwidth ) to the lowest order in @xmath94 , the radial size @xmath98 is : @xmath99 to first order in @xmath87 , the product @xmath100 which is closely related to the image surface does not depend on the ellipticity of the source .",
    "this result means that in practice for small ellipticity ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 is a constant independent of the source ellipticity .",
