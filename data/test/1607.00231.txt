    "this corroborates our finding in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] and further justifies the applicability of our toy model .    due to the large gap for charge excitations , the situation of mn ions in cdte resembles scenario  ( i ) in our toy model and explains the experimental observation of equidistant magnetization plateaus .",
    "the filling of the mn @xmath4-shell is not integer but the total spin of the mn ion and its surrounding atoms still is essentially @xmath5 .     as a function of the external field for the toy model with a partly filled exchange site , @xmath180.[fig : inequivalentsteps ] ]",
    "in this work we used three band structure methods , dft(gga ) , gga+@xmath0 , and gga+gutzwiller , to derive the exchange couplings between mn ions diluted in ii - vi semiconductor host materials such as cdte .",
    "first , we calculate the energy of the configurations with parallel and antiparallel alignments of the mn spins .",
    "next , we interpret the energy difference in terms of a two - spin heisenberg model and thereby deduce the exchange couplings as a function of the mn - mn separation for up to fourth neighbor distances .",
    "for the gga calculations we employ the fleur code with the functional of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof for large supercells with @xmath181 atoms where two of the cd ions are replaced by isovalent mn ions .",
    "the ab - initio results for the exchange couplings are too large by a factor of two to three which is related to the fact that dft(gga ) underestimates gaps in ii - vi semiconductors systematically .",
    "the nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath1 for mn ions in ii - vi semiconductors can be reconciled with experiment by using the gga+@xmath0 and gga+gutzwiller methods .",
    "these methods employ adjustable parameters that are used to match the experimental value for @xmath1 in cd(mn)te .",
    "the exchange couplings @xmath182 for 2nd , 3rd , and 4th neighbor distances are then predictions from theory .    in general , the values for @xmath183",
    "agree qualitatively with experiment , i.e. , band theory recovers @xmath2 and @xmath184 .",
    "however , the values for the couplings do not agree perfectly , i.e. , we observe quantitative deviations up to a factor of two . about the same level of accuracy",
    "can be obtained by a simple rescaling of the dft(gga ) data that fits the nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath1 , see tables  [ tab : jvalues ] , [ tab : three ] , [ tab : two ] , and [ tab : four ] .",
    "the bare energy scale in our itinerant - electron description are of the order of several ev , i.e. , of the order of @xmath185 , whereas the exchange couplings @xmath183 are one kelvin and below .",
    "therefore , it does not come as a surprise that the band structure methods reach their accuracy limits .",
    "the notion of exchange couplings and the applicability of the super - exchange approach hinges on the mapping of the low - energy degrees of freedom of the itinerant - electron problem to those of a spin-5/2 heisenberg model",
    ". this mapping successfully explains the equidistant magnetization plateaus as a function of applied magnetic field , as seen in experiment .",
    "however , the analysis of the gutzwiller ground state for the two - ion hubbard model shows that the filling of the mn @xmath4-shell is _ not _ integer which seemingly invalidates the whole concept of localized spins .",
    "the analysis of an exactly solvable few - site toy - model reassures that an integer filling is not a prerequisite for equidistant magnetization plateaus . due to the hybridization of the mn @xmath4 orbitals with its insulating environment , a slightly delocalized spin-5/2 magnetic moment is formed combing mn @xmath186 and @xmath138 with neighboring valence band states .",
    "our picture of an extended spin-5/2 magnetic moment interacting with each other reconciles the usage of an effective spin-5/2 heisenberg model to explain the experimentally observed magnetization steps and simultaneously a non - integer valence of the mn 3d shell .    in the case of mn - doped ii - vi semiconductors ,",
    "the gutzwiller method and the hartree - fock approach to the two - ion hubbard model lead to essentially the same results for an ( anti-)ferromagnetic alignment of the mn spins .",
    "our preliminary investigations show that this is not the case for cr in cdte where the dopant electrons are more itinerant than in the case of mn doping .",
    "we observe the same trend for mn doping of gaas and other iii - v semiconductors .",
    "this observation also indicates that the heisenberg mapping is less appropriate in these cases , and it is advisable to employ a correlated - electron approach for the description of the magnetic response in gaas samples at low mn doping .",
