    "two dimensional ( 2d ) non linear sigma models ( nlsm ) on supermanifolds , with and without wz term , seemed to be exotic objects , when they appeared in condensed matter physics twenty years ago as an elegant calculational tool in problems of self avoiding walks @xcite and disordered metals @xcite . later on they appeared in string theory context @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a progress in their understanding might be especially important for the theory of integer quantum hall plateau transition @xcite,@xcite and disordered systems @xcite , but this progress is very slow .",
    "many difficulties prevent a usage of standard technique in investigation of 2d nlsm .",
    "one of them is unavoidable non compactness of relevant target space supermanifolds .",
    "another  a complicated representation theory of the supergroups ( their superalgebras ) , where so called atypical representations play important , if not the main , role @xcite .",
    "an interest to 2d nlsm on supermanifolds was renewed recently in string theory in the context of ads / cft correspondence , when it was understood that some ads backgrounds can be described in terms of supercosets @xcite,@xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath1 is nothing but ( bosonic part of ) the super coset @xmath2 .",
    "hyperactivity in attempts to exploit integrability and methods of bethe ansatz as a calculational tool in checks of ads / cft correspondence ( see e.g. reviews @xcite and references therein ) , also supports this interest , since both spin chains ( on the gauge theory side ) and 2d nlsm ( on the ads side ) appearing there , usually have a supergroup symmetry .",
    "some more examples of this kind appear in the context of non critical strings ads / cft correspondence @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in this paper we try to investigate aspects of conformal invariance and quantum integrability of 2d nlsm ( without wz terms ) on some symmetric supergroup manifolds .",
    "list of the models we are interested in is the following .",
    "it starts from the principal chiral models ( pcm ) on the basic supergroups lie : @xmath3 .",
    "in addition we consider the following coset superspaces:@xmath4where @xmath5 . in all these cosets the factor algebra",
    "@xmath6 is a maximal regular subalgebra of @xmath7 .",
    "regular subalgebras of the basic lie superalgebras were classified in @xcite . for details of these cosets embedding",
    "see appendix .",
    "all the superspaces in ( lis ) are symmetric .",
    "we hope that these toy models will serve as a laboratory in investigation of more realistic ones , appearing both in condensed matter physics , and in string theory .",
    "one of the most interesting observations in this subject was done in the paper @xcite , where it was shown that 2d nlsm without wz term ( a pcm model ) on the supermanifold with @xmath8 symmetry is conformal in all orders of perturbation theory . in @xcite",
    "this result was obtained for @xmath9 pcm .",
    "the authors pointed out the existence of a casimir like chiral algebra of the model , but a principal difficulties did not allow to investigate the full spectrum of its representations .",
    "all the machinery of cft is hardly applicable for these non standard 2d cfts , although in some cases cft methods were successfully applied @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "as it is well known , any 2d nlsm on a symmetric space is classically integrable ( see , e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "classical integrability expresses itself , in particular , in the presence of conserved non local charges , or , in a more rigorous way , in the presence of backlund transform and spectral parameter dependent lax pairs .",
    "generalization of the standard procedure of non local current construction to the symmetric superspace case seems straightforward .",
    "it was shown for ordinary symmetric ( non super ) spaces that on the quantum level , absence of anomaly in these non local current conservation is guaranteed only if the factor group of a coset is either simple @xcite,@xcite or consists of a product of identical simple group by itself @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the same feature will remain in the case of symmetric superspaces . in this sense",
    ", the list of cosets above represents a good candidates for quantum integrable models .",
    "( one should consider the first and the third cosets with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "since the argument about presence / absence of anomaly in non local currents is based on the dimensions of operators calculated as engineering dimensions , one should be sure these dimensions are correct in the uv limit . in the ordinary ( non super- ) case",
    "this is guaranteed by asymptotical freedom ( positiveness of the beta function , at least in one loop ) of 2d nlsm on symmetric spaces .",
    "as we will see below , in general it is not the case for symmetric superspaces .",
    "requirement of asymptotic freedom which we are going to impose in order to preserve an ability to talk about naively calculated dimensions of the operators , will restrict possible values of @xmath12 in the list above to be grater then @xmath13 .",
    "so we start from calculation of one loop beta functions for the above cosets .",
    "as we will see , part of them @xmath14have zero one loop beta function .",
    "we extended our calculations to two loops and got zero . as we will show , the beautiful proof of @xcite that beta function is zero in all orders of perturbation theory , works in the same way for the superspaces on the manifolds @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in @xcite one loop background field calculations of beta function were done for some supercosets .",
    "extension of all loops proof @xcite to the supercosets seems problematical , but two loops beta function calculation we made confirms that it is equal to zero .",
    "we calculate the central charges of these cosets .",
    "calculation of one loop beta functions for the rest of the superspaces selects asymptotically free ones . for them",
    "we analyze the quantum anomaly in the first non trivial non local current conservation , and conclude that there is no anomaly with a proper choice of regularization .",
    "so the 2d nlsm on the superspaces ( [ lis ] ) are quantum integrable , and moreover , those from the list ( [ lisc ] ) are conformal invariant .",
    "we start from a geometrical approach to background field perturbation theory calculations of beta function for 2d nlsm on a riemannian supermanifold .",
    "we are going to discuss the action @xmath17",
    "\\label{ac}\\]]where @xmath7 is an element of supergroup ( supercoset ) manifold , and @xmath18 is the supertrace . a review of the method and main results for non super case one can find in @xcite . recall that usual qft background field methods should be modified being applied to 2d nlsm , if we wish to preserve target manifold riemannian covariance of calculations .",
    "one should expand the action around the classical geodesic trajectory @xmath19 on the manifold .",
    "then a result of calculations is expressed in terms of the basic covariant object ",
    "curvature tensor @xmath20 , their covariant derivatives , and products with different kind of indices contructions . in particular",
    ", the one loop beta function is proportional to the ricci tensor@xmath21 in general , only the one loop result is regularization scheme independent , higher loops depend on regularization . in dimensional regularization",
    "there exists the choice , for which the two loop result looks in the simplest way : @xmath22where the parenthesis means the symmetrization over the indices , and lowering / raising of indices is made by the manifold metric / its inverse . in principle , all this technology of beta function calculation may be extended to the supermanifolds . for definitions of the main objects of riemannian geometry on supermanifolds",
    "see for example @xcite . on the mathematical level of rigorosity ,",
    "there are some principal difficulties in basic definitions of supermanifolds ( even on the level of charts self consistency @xcite ) .",
    "but there is a way to overcome these difficulties in such a way that usual objects of riemannian geometry will be well defined @xcite , r .",
    "the only difference in these objects definitions from the non super case is some extra minus signes related to the grade of corresponding supermanifold coordinate . carefully following all the steps of covariant background field calculations described , for instance , in @xcite ,",
    "we got the same result for beta function ( [ b1]),([b2 ] ) , where @xmath23 now is the riemannian supercurvature tensor ( particular expression in terms of structure constants for supergroup manifold will be written below ) , and additional minus signs , appearing in feynmann diagrams as a result of grade 1 fields loops propagators , are encoded in the supermanifold metric used for indices contructions : @xmath24e}r_{\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;b}^{e(cd ] }   \\label{bsup}\\]]here @xmath25 $ ] means symmetrization if one of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is grassmann even , and it means anti symmetrization if both of them are grassmann odd .",
    "we hope to describe this technical calculational details elsewhere .",

    "the rici tensor defined as @xmath39 is proportional to the killing form . for the symmetric superspace case",
    "this property takes the form@xmath40an obvious but important for the future observation is that the summation over @xmath41 in the last formula may be extended on all the superalgebra @xmath7 : @xmath42 . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the last expression , considered as a relation on the whole superalgebra @xmath7 , is nothing but @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the value of the second casimir operator evaluated on the adjoint representation of the superalgebra @xmath7 , i.e. the dual coxeter number of @xmath7 : @xmath45 .",
    "the latter can be calculated purely algebraically , since it is the value of the second casimir operator on the adjoint representation  the rep . with highest weight with the highes root of @xmath7 .",
    "so we have an important simplifying statement : _ the one loop beta function on symmetric ( super)space _ @xmath0 @xmath46__is proportional to the dual coxeter number of _ _ @xmath7 _ _  itself__. this statement is valid for non super symmetric spaces as well . on the other hand",
    ", the value of the second casimir operator on any representation of quotient of a ( super)algebra @xmath7 by its regular subalgebra @xmath6 with highest weight @xmath47 , can be calculated using the formula @xmath48where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the sum of positive roots of @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "lets emphasis here that @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) depend on the particular form of usually non distinguished dynkin diagrams one should use for the proper embedding of @xmath6 into @xmath7 .",
    "change of the dynkin diagram for a given superalgebra changes also the order of its roots , and hence , the sum of positive roots .",
    "explicit case by case analysis confirms the statement we did above : the contribution of the term @xmath51 with @xmath47 the highest root of @xmath7 , vanishes for all the cosets from the list ( [ lis ] ) .",

    "one can see that if we are interested only in asymptotically free 2d nlsm on supergroups and their maximal regular supercosets ( [ lis ] ) with a non positive beta function ( non negative @xmath62 ) , one should reject the supergroup @xmath63 .",

    "the arguments of @xcite,@xcite are based on the counting of all possible terms compatible with the symmetries , which can appear in the operator product expansion of two currents .",
    "the counting of such terms is possible if one can trust to engineering dimensions of operators in the uv .",
    "this is guaranteed in the asymptotically free theories , and that is why we consider nlsm from list ( [ lis1 ] ) with the restriction @xmath183 .",
    "so the starting point is the splitting point regularization of ope @xmath184 = \\sum_{k}c_{\\mu \\nu } ^{(k)}(\\varepsilon ) y^{(k)}(t , x)\\]]where @xmath185 is a complete set of local operators of dimension not greater then two , such that @xmath186 is divergent or non zero when @xmath187 .",
    "all possible operators @xmath188 should be consistent with the existing symmetries .",
    "the left hand side is globally @xmath7-covariant and locally @xmath6-invariant , so the same should be on the right hand side .",
    "one can count all possible composite operators of dimension not greater then 2 with these symmetry properties .",
    "if one chooses a hermitian matrix realization for @xmath189 @xmath190 , any operator of this kind can be written as @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is a product of any number ( including zero ) of covariant derivatives @xmath193 .",
    "not all of these operators are independent .",
    "there are no operators of dimension 0 of this kind , there is one independent operator of spin 1  it is @xmath194 , and one can chose two independent operators of dimension 2 .",
    "the first is @xmath195 , and the second  @xmath196 . here",
    "@xmath197 is the stress tensor in the subgrpoup @xmath6 .",
    "the irreducible parts of @xmath198 in the case of semisimple @xmath6 , are @xmath199 .",
    "we also used the fact that symmetric superspace @xmath0 is by itself an irreducible representation of @xmath6 .",
    "the proof of this statement @xcite for the non super case uses , in addition to the symmetricity property , the fact that @xmath7 is simple , and existence of invariant bilinear non degenerate form on @xmath7 .",
    "the only subtle point in copying of this proof on symmetric superspace case is the last one : the natural form - the killing one - is identically zero for few cases of symmetric superspaces .",
    "but as we said , there exists another bilinear form , which is invariant and non degenerate .",
    "it can be successfully used in this proof instead of the killing form , and the proof still works .",
    "finally , the most general form of possible singular terms in the wilson expansion is@xmath184 = c_{\\mu \\nu } ^{\\rho } ( \\varepsilon ) j_{\\rho } ( x)+d_{\\mu \\nu } ^{\\sigma \\rho } ( \\varepsilon ) \\partial _ { \\sigma } j_{\\rho } ( x)+\\sum_{i}e_{\\mu \\nu } ^{(i)\\sigma \\rho } ( \\varepsilon ) g_{\\mu \\nu } ^{(i)}(x )   \\label{w}\\]]moreover , because of identity @xmath200 one can impose @xmath201lorentz and pt invariance and charge conjugation of ( [ w ] ) lead to an ansatz for unknown coefficients @xmath202 with some properties of their transformation under inversion of their argument sign . in particular , @xmath203ward identity applied to ( [ w ] ) gives first order differential equations on the scalar functions @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "one can show that these equations have a solution .",
    "the most singular part on the right hand side of ( [ w ] ) is defined by @xmath205 , and ( [ w ] ) implies that the regularization @xmath206-z_{\\delta } \\int dyj_{1}(t , y ) \\\\",
    "z_{\\delta } & = & \\int_{\\delta } ^{\\lambda } dxc_{1}(-x^{2})x\\end{aligned}\\]]has a finite limit when @xmath207 ( @xmath47 here is an irrelevant ir cutoff )",
    ". explicit calculation of @xmath208 using ( [ w ] ) and differential equations for @xmath204 , gives finally @xmath209one can see that in the case of simple @xmath6 we have zero on the right hand side just because of condition ( [ e0 ] ) .",
    "moreover , if we have semisimple @xmath210 composed as a tensor product power of one simple @xmath211 @xmath212 , there is no reason why corresponding @xmath213 for each @xmath214 should be different . due to the same condition ( [ e0 ] ) we again get zero .",
    "it completes the proof of absence of anomaly in the non local current conservation for the symmetric superspaces from the list ( [ lis1 ] ) .",
    "let us emphasis again that the anomaly analysis presented here is a complete copy of the analysis for the purely bosonic case , since the presence of the grassmann odd variables does nt change any of the steps described above .",
    "an important remark is in order here .",
    "as it was mentioned in @xcite , if one computes the potential anomaly terms coefficients @xmath215 explicitly , they ( including @xmath216 ) turn out to be proportional to the dual coxeter number of the group @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the renormalization procedure scheme of @xmath217  described above does nt work for supercosets with @xmath7 either @xmath72 , or @xmath218 , or @xmath88 , since for them @xmath219 .",
    "it shows that conformal invariant cases are different and can not be considered on the same footing with other quantum integrable sigma models .",
    "at least role of non local currents on the quantum level are different in the conformal and integrable symmetric superspaces nlsm .",
    "we saw that beta function for symmetric superspaces of regular type ( lis ) can be easily calculated in one loop .",
    "those cases where the beta function is negative ( the value of the second casimir operator on the coset is positive ) , one can expect an asymptotical freedom behavior .",
    "we have shown , that in the case of vanishing of one loop beta function , both in the case of supergroup manifold and in the case of supercoset spaces , the two loop beta function vanishes . in the case of the supergroup manifolds , the proof of @xcite of all loops vanishing of beta function on the supermanifold @xmath8 ,",
    "can be copied to the cases of supermanifolds @xmath220 .",
    "it would be important to extend the all loops conformal invariance proof to supercosets , and investigate higher orders conformal invariance for other ricci flat supercosets , in particular , constructed recently in @xcite .",
    "one of the possible tools of analysis of these new two dimensional cft may be investigation of the chiral algebra of casimir operators .",
    "recall , that by conjecture of @xcite the algebra of operators @xmath221where @xmath222 is invariant tensor of rank @xmath223 , remains chiral also on the quantum level .",
    "it seems such a conjecture should be universal for all the conformal nlsm ( [ lis1 ] ) .",
    "of course , there is a question whether such algebras contain the full symmetry of these models , but in any case , an understanding of their structure and especially of their representations , including the spectrum of primary fields , is an important and challenging problem .",
    "another interesting open question is the relation between these nlsm cfts and wzw models for the same supergroup ( supercoset ) manifolds @xcite .    in the last section we saw",
    "that the standard arguments about the absence of anomalies in non local current conservation known for the symmetric non super cases may be extended to the super case .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the all orders perturbation theory analysis of non local currents conservation developed in @xcite to the nlsm considered here . note that as we mentioned , there is an obstacle on the way to treat conformal nlsm ( [ lis1 ] ) on the same footing as integrable ones :",
    "the proof of absence of anomaly in the non local current conservation does nt work , at least formally .",
    "quantum integrability poses a question about construction of their exact ( relativistic ) s - matrices .",
    "this problem requires an understanding in which representation of @xmath7 leaves the fundamental massive multiplet of @xmath0 for all the cases .",
    "one can also expect serious problems in the bootstrap program realization , since , as usual , it goes in parallel to the construction of a `` fusion ring '' of representations of algebra @xmath7 , and situation here is much more involved compared to the case of non super spaces , mainly because of atypical representations , which complicates the s - matrix construction ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "of course the permanent problem of fixing of cdd ambiguity is also there .",
    "all these interesting and not simple problems are important in applications of 2d nlsm on supermanifolds to problems of condensed matter and string theory .",
    "i am thankful to d.gepner , m.gorelik and b.noyvert for useful discussions and to v.kac , s.ketov and c.young for communications .",
    "i am especially grateful to s.elitzur for many productive discussions and remarks .",
    "i am also thankful to einstein center for financial support .",
    "on the fig.2 the supercosets embeddings are shown in terms of superalgebras simple roots systems embeddings . recall that we are dealing with the regular subalgebras , when the root system of subalgebra @xmath6 is embedded into the root system of @xmath7 .",
    "for all the supercosets from the list ( [ lis ] ) the construction may be described in terms of dynkin diagrams as follows .",
    "one starts from ( usually not distinguished ) extended dynkin diagram of @xmath224 .",
    "the dynkin diagram should be chosen in such a way that among possible subdiagrams of @xmath224 one could find a diagram of @xmath6 by removing one ( in the case of proper subalgebras ) or more then one ( non proper case ) nodes from diagram @xmath224 . as we already said , the full classification of such subalgebras ( and hence corresponding supercosets )",
    "was done in @xcite .",
    "all cosets of this kind as supergroup manifolds , turn out to be symmetric superspaces . using the data @xcite for full root systems of lie superalgebras , and the diagrams below for the simple roots , one can list sets of positive and negative roots both for @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "this data is necessary if one wishes to check the equality of the value of second casimir operator calculated on adjoint representation of @xmath7 and on @xmath0 by the formula ( [ cas ] ) .",
    "the positive roots system data is necessary also for much more tedious exercise  check that all the coset @xmath0 root systems are by themselves irreducible representation moduli of @xmath6 . as it was mentioned above , this check is unnecessary , since the theorem of this kind proved in @xcite can be extended on the super case .      here",
    "we explain the block structure of embedding for matrix realization of cosets @xmath170 and @xmath225 .",
    "we start from the former .",
    "we chose the standard matrix realization of @xmath15 as a @xmath226 by @xmath226 even supermatrix built from two even diagonal blocks ( @xmath84 and @xmath81 ) , and two non diagonal grassmann odd blocks .",
