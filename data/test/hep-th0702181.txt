    "gravity with massive gravitons got much interest in recent years in view of the evidence for dark energy . however , various massive gravity theories suffer from serious defects . there may be a discontinuity if the graviton mass @xmath0 goes to zero ( vdvz discontinuity ) , a violation of lorentz invariance or fields with wrong sign of the kinetic term in the lagrangian ( @xcite and references given therein ) .",
    "it is misleading to call those fields `` ghosts '' because this name is occupied by the fermi fields with integer spin which are essential in gauge theories ( faddeev - popov ghosts ) .",
    "the reason for the failure is that those theories have been set up _ without taking the gauge structure into account_. the early work by boulware and deser @xcite can be criticized for the same reason .",
    "one should never forget that gravity is a gauge theory side by side with non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "this is true for both , massless and massive gravity .",
    "in fact , d.r.grigore and one of us ( g.s . ) have constructed the massive spin-2 gauge theory on minkowski background according to the laws of perturbative quantum gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the result was that this theory is essentially unique and its classical limit agrees ( in the pure graviton sector ) with general relativity with a cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "the consistency has been verified beyond linear gravity up to the quartic couplings of the graviton .",
    "a proof to all orders has been given in the massless case @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that massive gravity considered as spin-2 quantum gauge theory is mathematically consistent .",
    "there remains the question whether it is also consistent with nature for the very small graviton mass @xmath2 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this theory has no discontinuity for @xmath3 as far as the graviton propagator is concerned .",
    "of course it is fully lorentz invariant .",
    "another question is whether the additional degrees of freedom of the massive graviton give rise to a low strong coupling scale as in the theories ( @xcite ) mentioned above .",
    "this question is studied here for gravitational bremsstrahlung because this process might be close to experimental observations .",
    "the origin of the so - called strong coupling is the longitudinal graviton mode of the form ( see @xcite eq.(6 ) ) @xmath4 since @xmath2 is very small , the scattering amplitudes involving this mode get large . but this disaster is not real because the longitudinal ( massive ) graviton states do not belong to the physical hilbert space @xmath5 . as well known in a gauge theory , @xmath5 is defined by means of the nilpotent gauge charge @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) in the following , two possible forms @xcite @xmath8 the second representation [ kerq ] is best suited for the construction of the physical states in momentum space . for massive gravity ,",
    "@xmath6 is given in terms of the asymptotic free quantum fields by @xmath9\\overleftrightarrow{\\d}_0\\,u_\\mu(x)\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the symmetric tensor field , @xmath11 a bose vector field and @xmath12 is the fermiomic ghost field .",
    "all fields satisfy klein - gordon equations with mass @xmath0 , further properties are discussed in the next section .    to study massive gravity in the neighborhood of @xmath13 , we choose a lorentz frame where the graviton momentum is @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "then in section 3 , we determine the kernel of the selfadjoint operator in [ kerq ] by calculating its eigenfunctions for eigenvalue 0 .",
    "the kernel consists of 6 modes .",
    "two modes agree exactly with the two transverse graviton states of the massless theory .",
    "the other four modes have contributions from the emission operators of the vector field @xmath11 . in the limit @xmath3 , only the latter survive .",
    "for this reason , we call @xmath11 the vector - graviton field . note that no longitudinal mode contributes to the physical subspace in this representation . since the vector - graviton does not couple to ordinary matter in a gauge invariant way , the cross - sections for bremsstrahlung go over smoothly into the massless ones in the limit @xmath3 .    in the last section ,",
    "we calculate the differential cross - section and the total radiated energy of quantum gravitational bremsstrahlung in the lowest order of perturbation theory for @xmath13 .",
    "it seems that this has not been done before for the full tensor theory . in particular",
    ", we consider the case of an ultrarelativistic particle being scattered by a heavy mass @xmath16 through a small angle . under these assumptions ,",
    "our results agree with classical calculations .",
    "the basic free asymptotic fields of massive gravity are the symmetric tensor field @xmath17 with arbitrary trace , the fermionic ghost @xmath18 and anti - ghost @xmath19 fields and the bosonic vector - graviton field @xmath20 .",
    "they all satisfy the massive klein - gordon eqations @xmath21 and are quantized as follows @xcite @xmath22=-ib^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}d_{m_0}(x - y)\\ ] ] with @xmath23&=&{\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}d_{m_0}(x - y)\\label{comvg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and zero otherwise . here , @xmath24 is the jordan - pauli distribution with mass @xmath0 and @xmath25 the minkowski tensor .",

    "the commutators or anticommutators with @xmath6 , respectively , define the gauge variations of the asymptotic fields .",

    "now we are able to formulate gauge invariance of the s - matrix .",
    "let @xmath28 be the perturbative s - matrix where @xmath29 is a schwartz test function which switches the interaction .",
    "the time - ordered products @xmath30 are expressed in terms of free fields defined above . then @xmath31 is well defined and gauge invariance of @xmath32 is defined perturbatively as follows :    first order gauge invariance : @xmath33    @xmath34-th order gauge invariance : @xmath35 where the time - ordered products must be appropriately normalized .",
    "it is a very nice feature that the conditions [ dqt1 ] and [ dqtn ] for @xmath36 determine the theory essentially uniquely ( that means up to divergence and coboundary couplings ) .",
    "no classical lagrangian is needed .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in case of the massive spin-2 theory we have : @xmath37 up to a coupling constant , where @xmath38 is the trace ; all products are normally ordered . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", this result is in agreement with the expansion of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian with a cosmological constant @xcite .    for bremsstrahlung",
    "we need the gravity - matter couplings .",
    "we represent the matter by a non - hermitian scalar field @xmath39 of mass @xmath40 .",
    "its coupling to @xmath41 can be derived from gauge invariance as in the massless case ( @xcite , sect.5.9 ) : @xmath42 but in the massive case , there may also be a coupling between @xmath39 and the vector - graviton field @xmath11 of the form @xmath43 in order to fulfill first order gauge invariance [ dqt1 ] , @xmath44 must be a divergence . using @xmath45 and [ dqv ]",
    "we obtain @xmath46 this must be a divergence @xmath47 then it follows that @xmath48 and @xmath49 since such a divergence coupling is physically irrelevant , there exists no non - trivial gauge invariant coupling between @xmath11 and @xmath39 .    finally , the interaction of the @xmath39-particle with an external classical potential is described by [ coup ] where @xmath10 is substituted by @xmath50 . in the newtonian limit , which we will consider later",
    ", we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the newtonian potential .",
    "to get a concrete hilbert space representation , we must express the various fields by means of emission and absorption operators .",
    "we follow the discussion of the massless case in @xcite as close as possible .",
    "we decompose @xmath53 into its traceless part and the trace @xmath54 @xmath55 from [ hquant ] we obtain the following commutation relations @xmath56&=&4id_{m_0}(x - y)\\label{hcom}\\\\ \\big[h^{\\alpha\\beta}(x ) , h^{\\mu\\nu}(y)\\big]&=&-it^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}d_{m_0}(x - y)\\label{hcom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 and @xmath58=0\\ ] ] we claim that the fields in [ hcom ] and [ hcom ] can be represented as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is symmetric and satisfies the commutation relation @xmath61=\\eta^{\\alpha\\alpha } \\eta^{\\beta\\beta}t^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}\\delta(\\vec k-\\vec k')\\ ] ] the trace part is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63=4\\delta(\\vec k-\\vec k')\\ ] ] since the right - hand side is positive , the @xmath54-sector of the fock space can be constructed in the usual way by applying products of @xmath64 s to the vacuum .",

    "we will assume the mass @xmath40 of the particle to be much smaller than the central mass @xmath112 and the scattering takes place under a small angle @xmath113 which in the classical picture corresponds to a large impact parameter @xmath114 .",
    "then we are able to use the first born approximation for the external field @xmath52 .",
    "since at the end , we want to compare our results with the classical theory , we consider the case of ultra - relativistic particle energy ( @xmath115 ) and low frequency ( @xmath116 ) .",

    "then the total matrix element becomes ( under the same assumptions as @xcite ) @xmath147 where @xmath148 and the star is complex conjugation . by squaring , summing over the two polarizations , and integrating over the spherical angles of the emitted graviton , we find the cross section @xmath149 in order to make contact to the classical theory , we use the relation between the scattering angle @xmath146 and the impact parameter @xmath114 in the presence of a newtonian field . in the ultra - relativistic case , it has the form @xmath150 and we use the definition of the energy cross section @xmath151 with @xmath152 we arrive at @xmath153 in order to obtain the total radiated energy @xmath154 we must have an estimate for the threshold frequency @xmath155 of the low - frequency region in the case of gravitational interaction . in order to compare with classical results , we insert the classical value ( @xcite ) @xmath156 in [ e ] , and find the total energy radiated in a single encounter @xmath157 our result [ de ] agrees with the result obtained by galtsov et al .",
    "@xcite up to a factor of two .",

    "all those classical calculations arrived at the total radiated energy @xmath158 in agreement with our result [ etot ] .",
    "one important point to mention is the range of validity of the results obtained from the born approximation in quantum theory . since the external field",

    "there are no astrophysical objects satisfying this condition .",
