    "yy geminorum , ( bd + 32 1582 , sao 60199 , gliese 278c ) , is a short period ( 19.54 hours ) eclipsing binary with two almost identical dm1e ( flare star ) components . the close binary is a subsystem of the nearby castor multiple star ( yy gem = castor c ) , at a distance of @xmath314.9 pc . the binary nature was discovered in 1916 ( adams & joy , 1917 ) and the first spectroscopic orbits were given by joy & sanford ( 1926 ) . as the brightest known eclipsing binary of the dme type , yy gem is an important fundamental standard for defining the low - mass main sequence mass - luminosity and mass - radius relationships ( torres & ribas , 2002 ) .",
    "however , it was clear already from kron s ( 1952 ) pioneer study that there are significant surface inhomogeneities ( starspots ) affecting the observed brightness of both components , likely to complicate data analysis .",
    "yy gem was the first star , after the sun , in which such maculation effects were demonstrated . before we can accurately define the intrinsic luminosities of such stars we need to clarify the scale of these effects .",
    "this is also significant for comparing the photometric parallax with direct measurements , such as that from hipparcos ( budding et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the system was reviewed by torres & ribas ( 2002 ) and qian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the latter concentrating mainly on apparent variations of the orbital period .",
    "torres & ribas ( 2002 ) gave revised values for the mean mass and radius of the very similar components as ( solar units ) @xmath4 = 0.5992@xmath50.0047 , @xmath6 = 0.6191@xmath50.0057 , with mean effective temperature @xmath7 = 3820@xmath5100 k , as well as an improved parallax for the system of 66.90@xmath50.63 mas .",
    "from such results , torres & ribas argued that there had been a tendency to adopt systematically erroneous parameters for dwarf stars comparable to yy gem , with wider implications for low - mass stars in general .",
    "determination of the precise structure of these stars , in view of the absence of definitive information on their intrinsic , spot - free , luminosities , is still rather an open question .",
    "torres & ribas ( 2002 ) and qian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) revised the work of chabrier & baraffe ( 1995 ) , giving radiative core radii of about 70% , leaving the outer 30% to account for the convective zone .",
    "the strong subsurface convective motions , give rise to large - scale magnetic fields that produce large starspots ( cf .",
    "bopp & evans , 1973 ) .",
    "moffet first reported large flare events , and , in subsequent studies , yy gem has been shown to be very active ( moffet and barnes , 1979 ; lacy et al .",
    ", 1976 ; doyle & butler , 1985 ; doyle & mathioudakis , 1990 ; doyle et al . 1990 ) .",
    "doyle et al ( 1990 ) have previously described photometric observations of repetitive , apparently periodic , flares on yy gem which were observed during this programme .",
    "more recently , gao et al .",
    "( 2008 ) modelled such periodicity effects on the basis of magnetic reconnection between loops on the two stars generating interbinary flares .",
    "fast magneto - acoustic waves in plasma trapped in the space between the two components are thought to modulate the magnetic reconnection , producing a periodic behaviour of the flaring rate .",
    "doyle et al .",
    "( 1990 ) had previously suggested filament oscillations .",
    "several authors , ( see vrsnak et al .",
    "2007 ) have subsequently reported solar filament oscillations of similar duration to those suggested on yy gem .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of flare activity on yy gem were initiated by jackson , kundu & white ( 1989 ) using radio data from the vla ( see also , gary , 1986 ) .",
    "stelzer et al .  ( 2002 ) used the chandra and xmm - newton satellites in simultaneous observations of the x - ray spectrum , while saar & bookbinder ( 2003 ) carried out far ultraviolet observations .",
    "impulsive uv and x - ray phenomena , taken to be essentially flare - like , were shown to be orders of magnitude stronger than those occurring on the sun ( haisch et al . , 1990 ) .",
    "tsikoudi & kellett ( 2000 ) , reviewing x - ray and uv observations of the castor system , reported a large ( exosat ) flare event with total x - ray emission estimated as @xmath37@xmath8 ergs .",
    "their comparison of x - ray and bolometric heating rates pointed to strong magnetic activity within hot coronal components .",
    ".multiwavelength observations of yy gem , march 1988 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the march 1988 coordinated multiwavelength campaign on yy geminorum resulted in less extensive ground - based coverage than originally planned .",
    "this was principally due to the exceptionally bad weather which prevailed in the canary islands at that time .",
    "nevertheless , useful data were obtained from ground - based facilities in the western hemisphere , notably the vla and mauna kea in hawaii , as well as space - based facilities on board the iue and ginga satellites .    with the aid of computer modelling of the v - band eclipse light curve , we obtain almost identical luminosities and radii for the two components of yy gem and , when combined with previously published radial velocity curves , masses of @xmath9 and radii of @xmath10 are derived .",
    "fits to the out - of - eclipse light curves with spot models give two cool spots roughly @xmath11 apart in longitude and at latitudes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 and one bright spot at @xmath14 latitude . due to the high orbital inclination",
    ", there is significant ambiguity in the latitudes derived and it is not possible to determine on which component the maculation occurs .",
    "combining these models with the additional broad - band colours b , r , i and k , allows estimates to be made of the temperature differential between the cool spots and the normal photosphere .",
    "we estimate a value of @xmath15 , closely similar to previous results by vogt ( 1981 ) on by draconis .",
    "analysis of the line profiles of h@xmath0 in contemporaneous spectra of yy gem indicates that the radii of the h@xmath0 emission volumes are about 4% larger than the optical radii .",
    "we have observed the secondary eclipse of yy gem in the ultraviolet emission lines of mg ii and ly@xmath0 with the iue satellite .",
    "when scaled , the mg ii eclipse light curve is fitted well by the v - band light curve , indicating the presence of a chromosphere on yy gem with uniformly emitting mg ii from contiguous plage regions .",
    "the existence of a widespread network of emission in the chromospheric lines of caii and mgii on the sun has been known for many years ( see phillips , 1992 ) .",
    "a similar picture emerges from studies of many spotted stars where high levels of mgii line flux have been observed along with a relatively small degree of rotational modulation ( see butler et al . 1987 ; butler , 1996 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 light curve of yy gem , on the other hand , has a much broader secondary eclipse suggesting an extended outer atmosphere with a height of the order of twice the radius .",
    "yy gem was detectable with the vla at both 3.6 and 6 cm wavelengths but not at 20 cm .",
    "both the primary and secondary eclipses appear in the 6 cm light curve on 5 march but on the following day the secondary eclipse is no longer evident .",
    "a poor signal - to - noise ratio prevents us from drawing any definitive conclusions about either eclipse at radio wavelengths , however there are indications that both the primary and secondary eclipses are narrower and slightly offset in phase in 6 cm emission compared to the optical v - band which would be indicative of relatively compact radio emitting regions .",
    "the almost total primary eclipse compared to a drop to only half the uneclipsed flux at the secondary eclipse would suggest that the emitting region on the primary is more compact than that on the secondary .",
    "four flares which were detected optically on yy gem during this campaign and have been reported earlier showed evidence of periodicity ( see doyle et al .",
    "two possible mechanisms which could have given rise to the periodicity are : ( 1 ) oscillations in magnetic filaments associated with the flares , or ( 2 ) fast magneto - acoustic waves between the binary components as described by gao et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    in this paper",
    "we show optical observations of two further flares on yy gem , one of which was also seen in soft x - rays by the ginga satellite and the other in 6-cm radiation by the vla .",
    "estimates of the integrated optical energy , based on the photometry are possible for both flares . for the flare seen by ginga",
    ", we can also derive the integrated soft x - ray flux , leading to an estimate for the ratio of the integrated x - ray to optical energy ,",
    "l@xmath16/l@xmath2 @xmath3 0.1 , closely similar to the ratio observed in flares on other dme stars .",
    "the well established correspondence between the soft x - ray and radio fluxes by benz & gudel ( 1994 ) allows us to make an indirect estimate of the soft x - ray energy of the flare seen by the vla and thereby estimate l@xmath16/l@xmath2 for this additional flare .",
    "the ratio l@xmath16/l@xmath2 for both yy gem flares lies close to the value predicted by katsova s gas - dynamic model of a stellar flare in a constrained magnetic loop .",
    "if this ratio was @xmath3 1000 , as found for some solar flares , it would indicate , according to katsova , an origin in an open magnetic structure where evaporation precluded excessive heating of the affected plasma .",
    "lastly , we note the coincidence in binary phase of several indicators of magnetic activity on yy gem .",
    "the flares observed in x - rays and the radio region occurred at phases 0.27 and 0.15 respectively ; i.e. within the phase interval during which the largest spot at longitude 94.8@xmath17 would be visible .",
    "spectroscopic data obtained as part of this campaign also provides evidence of an h@xmath0 emission region on the primary component with increasing visibility from phase 0.25 to 0.35 . a reasonable interpretation of these observations would be that all are manifestations of magnetic activity from a single large active region on the primary component of yy gem .",
    "this is not an unexpected conclusion as similar associations between flares , h@xmath0 emission regions and spots are common on the sun and have been seen previously on other stellar systems ( see rodono et al .",
