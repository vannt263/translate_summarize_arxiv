    "advances in self - assembly and nanofabrication resulted recently in the thinnest superconductors , i.e. , single - crystalline metallic nanofilms with atomically uniform thickness down to a few monolayers , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "they are characterized by an extraordinary purity and , so , the only issue of disorder in the case of interest is due to the interface between the substrate and the nanofilm .",
    "such an interface has an effect on the reflection of electron waves ( it is not perfectly specular ) . nevertheless , there are clear signatures of the formation of discrete levels for the perpendicular electron motion [ i.e. , quantum - well states ( qws ) ] in tunneling spectra .",
    "@xcite pairing correlations appear to be very robust in single - crystalline nanofilms so that even @xmath0 and @xmath4 films with thickness of @xmath5 were found not to exhibit any considerable signs of degradation of superconductivity due to fluctuations .",
    "@xcite experimental results for the temperature dependence of the pairing gap show almost no deviations from the ordinary bcs picture , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "however , it is worth noting that , for some samples , there appear signatures of suppression of density of states ( dos ) in the tunneling spectra at low voltage above @xmath6 , which resembles , to some extent , the pseudogap physics of high-@xmath6 superconductors .",
    "@xcite    another recent experimental breakthrough concerns the iron - pnictides ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .  ) , i.e. , a new generation of multi - band superconductors specified by the interplay of different band - dependent superconducting condensates .",
    "this renewed the interest in multi - band superconductivity .",
    "in particular , one of the most intriguing points is a competition of the characteristic lengths of the different condensates  @xcite and a possible contribution of such a competition to new phenomena , including recently observed and strongly debated unconventional patterns of the vortex distribution in magnesium - diboride .",
    "@xcite    the question arises if there is any relation between bulk multi - band superconductors and high - quality superconducting nanofilms ?",
    "in fact , they are similar in many important respects . as already mentioned above ,",
    "tunneling experiments demonstrate that the conduction band in metallic nanofilms splits up into a series of subbands in such a way that the bottom of each subband is at the energy position of the corresponding qws .",
    "@xcite for example , @xmath0 nanofilms with thickness @xmath1-@xmath7 are two - band(subband ) superconductors .",
    "@xcite in those metallic superconducting nanofilms the energetic position of each subband with respect to the fermi level @xmath8 changes with thickness , i.e. , the discrete perpendicular levels scale as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the thickness of the nanofilm while the accompanying variation of @xmath8 is almost insignificant .",
    "@xcite additional reasons for shifting in energy of the subband bottoms as measured from @xmath8 are due to fabrication circumstances : the presence or absence of a protective cover , an effect of the wetting layer , use of different substrates etc . , which can significantly change the behavior of the single - electron wave functions at the interface ( and , so , the qws energy ) .",
    "thus , the relevant microscopic parameters of the different subbands , e.g. , dos and the fermi velocity ( in the parallel direction ) , are not fixed and can significantly vary from sample to sample even for the same thickness .",
    "it is possible to expect that these parameters can , in principle , be tailored in future experiments .",
    "therefore , it is timely to investigate in more detail the properties of the superconducting state in metallic single - crystalline nanofilms in the case when the bottom of one of the relevant single - electron subbands approaches the fermi level .",
    "below we show that the pairing in such a subband exhibits a clear molecule - like trend , which is very similar to the bcs - bec crossover investigated at length in cold atomic gases , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "in particular , we predict that striking results can be obtained for @xmath0 nanofilms with thicknesses @xmath1-@xmath7 , where up to half of all the cooper pairs nearly collapse , i.e. , shrinking in the lateral size ( parallel to the nanofilm ) down to a few nanometers .",
    "our finding significantly compliments the recent first observation of the bcs - bec crossover in a solid - state material , i.e. , in one of the available subbands in a multiband superconducting iron - chalcogenide @xmath11 , see ref .  .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ one - band ] we address the criterion of the bcs - bec crossover - like behavior in a given single - electron subband .",
    "we show that a condensed pair of electrons significantly shrinks in its lateral size ( parallel to the nanofilm ) when the ratio of the parallel kinetic energy of electrons to the absolute value of the potential energy becomes smaller than one , i.e. , when the subband bottom approaches the fermi level . in sec .",
    "[ two - band ] we investigate @xmath1 and @xmath7 thick lead nanofilms , where only two single - electron subbands are occupied , i.e. , we have a coherent mixture of two condensates , and one of them is specified by an extremely small characteristic length .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "it is well - known that the governing parameter for the bcs - bec crossover in the system with fermionic pairing correlations is the ratio of the relevant kinetic energy @xmath12 to the absolute value of the potential energy @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 , we are in the bcs regime with loosely bound and rather extensive cooper pairs ( the bcs limit corresponds to @xmath15 ) . on the opposite side of the crossover , when @xmath16 , molecule - like bound pairs appear with the bec limit @xmath17 . here",
    "it is worth noting that an extensive analysis of the behavior of the kinetic and potential energy through the bcs - bec crossover for the attractive hubbard model  @xcite gave @xmath18 at the bcs side , while approaching the bec regime it resulted in @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , the right balance between the strength of the kinetic and interaction energy has been considered as an essential feature of high-@xmath6 superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    keeping in mind the criterion based on the ratio @xmath20 , let us examine what happens with a cooper pair in a given subband when changing the position of its bottom with respect to @xmath8 in single - crystalline nanofilms . if the bottom of the subband is situated far below the fermi level , the mean kinetic energy of electrons in this subband comes mostly from the parallel motion , i.e. , @xmath21 . in this case",
    "however , when the subband bottom ( or the corresponding qws ) approaches the fermi surface , we have @xmath23 and , so , @xmath24 becomes much smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "the parallel motion of electrons is reduced , and such a redistribution of the kinetic energy between the perpendicular and parallel spatial degrees of freedom leads to a significant decrease in the ratio @xmath25 . furthermore",
    ", when the subband bottom goes above the fermi level ( such a subband still makes a contribution unless its bottom is above @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the debye frequency ) , @xmath28 and , hence , @xmath25 becomes extremely small , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , when assuming that the ratio @xmath25 controls the lateral size of a condensed fermionic pair associated with the corresponding subband in the nanofilm , we expect from the above arguments a significant reduction in the lateral size of the cooper pairs .    to go into more detail , let us consider a superconducting nanoslab in the clean limit , with perfectly specular reflection at the boundaries .",
    "possible effects of the scattering of electrons at the interface between a substrate and the nanofilm will be discussed later .",
    "the translational invariance in the perpendicular direction is broken due to quantum confinement and , so , we deal with a spatially nonuniform order parameter @xmath30 problem . as a consequence",
    ", the ordinary bcs self - consistent equation should be abandoned in favor of a more elaborate analysis based on the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations ( or , equally , on the gorkov green s function formalism ) . as shown in ref .",
    ", the bdg equations are appropriate to describe the bcs - bec crossover in spatially nonuniform fermionic systems at nearly zero temperatures .",
    "in particular , it has been shown in ref .   that the bdg equations reproduce the gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate wave function at the bec side of the crossover .",
    "therefore , if our reasoning based on @xmath25 is correct , we can expect that the spatial profile of the wave function of a condensed electronic pair will change ( dramatically ) crossing over from the bcs regime  ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) to the bec regime ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) . in the bcs regime",
    "this pair - wave function will have many oscillations with the period of the fermi wavelength @xmath32 and will decay over a significantly larger distance ( as compared to @xmath32 ) determined by the size of the extended cooper pairs . approaching the bec regime",
    ", the pair - wave function will have only some insignificant residual oscillations  ( e.g. , due to the presence of the ultraviolet cut - off ) and will be concentrated at short separations between electrons associated with the size of a molecule - like pair ( it is close to or smaller than @xmath32 ) . for a superconducting slab the bdg equations can be written in the form    [ bdg ] @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the quantum number associated with the quantum - confined motion in the @xmath35 direction , @xmath36 is the wavevector of the quasi - free motion of electrons in the direction parallel to the nanofilm ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions ) ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the particle - like and hole - like ket vectors ; @xmath41 is the quasiparticle energy .",
    "in addition , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the electron position operator , and @xmath44  ( @xmath45 stands for the complex conjugate ) is the single - electron hamiltonian  ( measured from the fermi level @xmath8 ) @xmath46 with @xmath47 the band mass set to the free electron mass and @xmath48 the confining potential .",
    "equations ( [ bdg ] ) are solved together with the self - consistency relation given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the coupling constant , and we limit ourselves to zero temperature . we ignore pairing of electrons between different subbands , which is justified when the intersubband energy spacing , i.e. , @xmath51 , is significantly larger than the pairing energy ( it is always true for ultrathin films ) . in this case",
    "it is possible to take into account only the pairing of the time reversed states , which means that ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the single - electron energy measured from the fermi level , and the factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 are chosen real , together with the order parameter . based on eqs .",

    "to check our arguments about the influence of the ratio @xmath64 on the lateral subband - dependent size of the cooper pairs , we need to study the `` wave function '' of a condensed fermionic pair , i.e. , the anomalous average of the field operators @xmath65 .",
    "more precisely , the anomalous average is proportional to the bound - like eigenstate of the two - particle density matrix , which can be safely interpreted as the wave function of a condensed fermionic pair , see , e.g. , refs .   and .",

    "the asymptote for @xmath83 at large @xmath84 can be calculated analytically in several interesting cases . when the qws level ( i.e. , the subband bottom ) is situated far below the fermi level , i.e. , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we find @xmath87 , \\label{bcs}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the macdonald function and @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the subband - dependent fermi velocity ( for parallel motion ) .",
    "this is nothing more but the ordinary bcs behavior : first , there are fast oscillations with period of the subband - dependent fermi wavelength @xmath91  [ this comes from @xmath92 ; second , we obtain the exponential overall decay governed by @xmath93 , as seen from the asymptote of @xmath94 .    when qws touches the fermi level , i.e. , @xmath95 , eq .",

    "instead , we obtain a rather slowly oscillating factor @xmath103 but the role of these oscillations is almost negligible because they can only manifest themselves for separations of electrons in a condensed pair such that @xmath83 almost approaches zero .",
    "so , our expectations based on the behavior of the parameter @xmath25 are relevant : when the subband bottom touches the fermi level , the cooper pairs associated with this subband nearly collapse ( as compared to typical values of the zero - temperature bcs coherence length ) in the lateral direction , shrinking by a factor of @xmath104 .",

    "it is also of importance to note here that despite a significant shrinking in their lateral size down to @xmath120 , the condensed pairs of electrons do not suffer from the coulomb repulsive effects . in metals",
    "such effects can be expected only for the separations smaller than @xmath133-@xmath134 whereas in the subband whose bottom is in the vicinity of the fermi level @xmath135-@xmath136 , i.e. , the mean density of electrons in the subband whose bottom approaches @xmath8 is significantly smaller than the total mean electron density .",
    "we stress that this does not prevent this subband from making a significant contribution to the coherent phenomena , see sec .",
    "[ two - band ] .    based on the results of this section",
    ", we can conclude that the redistribution of the kinetic energy between the perpendicular and parallel spatial degrees of freedom leads to a significant reconstruction of the internal distribution of electrons in a condensed pair so that we find a clear molecule - like trend in the pairing .",
    "this behavior is found for the pair condensate in a subband whose bottom approaches the fermi level . in total",
    ", we have a coherent mixture of different subband - dependent condensates .",
    "so , the question arises what are the consequences of this mixture in the presence of the bcs - bec crossover - like behavior in one of the available subbands .",
    "this point is addressed in the next section .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the results for the fermionic condensate associated with one of the single - electron subbands appearing due to quantization of the perpendicular electron motion . however , due to the presence of multiple subbands we have a coherent mixture of subband - dependent fermionic condensates each making a different contribution to the total condensate and superconducting characteristics . in nanofilms , due to the quasi-2d character of the electron motion , such contributions are , as a rule , almost equal to each other , except in the case when the subband bottom becomes significantly higher than @xmath137 .",
    "in particular , when it approaches the level @xmath138 , the corresponding subband stops to contribute due to the ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "the most interesting choice is realized when there are only two relevant subbands ,  @xcite which is the case for , e.g. , lead nanofilms with thicknesses @xmath1 and @xmath7  ( see the sketch given in fig .",

    "the optimal variant of tuning the subband positions is when the bottom of the upper subband is situated at @xmath137 .",

    "the dotted line in both panels correspond to @xmath161 . ]",
    "what are possible experimental evidences of such shrinking of the cooper pairs due to the bcs - bec crossover - like behavior in single - crystalline nanofilms ?",
    "first of all , this is a competition of different characteristic spatial lengths of two condensates .",
    "it was recently shown that such a competition can lead to the appearance of long - range attraction between vortices in a two - band superconductor , see ref .  .",
    "in this case the abrikosov lattice of vortices formed in the perpendicular magnetic field will melt , with possible formation of stripes and clusters of vortices .",
    "@xcite second , the profile of the order parameter in the core of the vortex will be sensitive to the presence of the condensate with extremely small spatial coherence length , which can be probed via the scanning tunneling microscopy , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "third , we can also expect significant proliferation of pair fluctuations in the presence of a single - electron subband with the bottom next to @xmath8 .",
    "such fluctuations will result in the suppression of the dos at the fermi level above the critical temperature  @xcite , i.e. , the pseudogap behavior .",
    "however , it is difficult to say whether or not these pairing fluctuations make a contribution to the pseudogap - like behavior revealed recently in single - crystalline lead nanofilms  @xcite : other mechanisms can also be involved  ( see discussion in ref .  ) and , so , a more involved analysis is needed .",
    "in addition , josephson physics and andreev states will be also very sensitive to the appearance of the molecule - like trend in pairing and to the competition of different length - scales .",
    "in particular , these important things can be probed with hybrid superconducting devices similar to , e. g. , a carbon nanotube joining a superconducting loop .",
    "@xcite in our case the single - crystalline metallic nanofilm is supposed to transmit the current between superconductors over mesoscopic distances ( to keep the nanofilm in the normal state it is necessary to have the critical temperature of leads higher than that of the nanofilm ) .",
    "in conclusion , we demonstrated that quantum confinement of the perpendicular motion of electrons in single - crystalline metallic superconducting nanofilms leads to the formation of a nanoscale multi - band(subband ) superconductor .",
    "the position in energy of each subband can vary significantly depending on the fabrication process , and it is possible that the bottom of one of such subbands is situated in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "we showed that the character of the superconducting pairing in such a subband changes dramatically and exhibits a clear molecule - like trend , which is very similar to the bcs - bec crossover but now driven by the perpendicular size - quantization .",
    "though we have considered the system in the clean limit , our results will also be relevant in the presence of a moderate disorder .",
    "the main issue for disorder in high - quality metallic superconducting nanofilms comes from the scattering of electrons at the interface between a substrate and the nanofilm , which leads to a broadening of the qws levels . though this will smoothen a drop in the lateral size of the cooper pairs , our results given in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) make it possible to expect that the effect in question will survive to a great extent until the broadening essentially exceeds @xmath162 .",
    "here it is worth noting that in experiments with lead nanofilms , the level broadening of qws can be reduced , in the presence of a crystalline interface , down to @xmath163-@xmath164  ( at zero temperature and at energies close to @xmath8 ) , see ref .  .",
    "this does not exceed @xmath165 mentioned above , which gives quite an optimistic view on the prospects of an experimental observation of the effect in question .",
    "we would also like to note that the line width for the perpendicular discrete levels increases with temperature due to electron - phonon scattering .",
    "though such an increase is not very pronounced for temperatures around @xmath6 , i.e. , it is of about @xmath166 , see ref .  , this will cause an additional temperature - dependent smoothing .",
    "so , the optimal choice to probe the bcs - bec - like crossover in single - crystalline nanofilms is to stay at nearly zero temperatures .",
    "we would also like to highlight strong similarities between our findings and recent angle resolved photoemission results  @xcite for multiband superconducting iron - chalcogenide @xmath11 .",
    "it was found in ref .   that the investigated sample of @xmath11 does not lay deep in either the bcs or bec regimes but lays instead in the bcs - bec crossover domain .",
    "as demonstrated above , the same conclusion holds for @xmath114 and @xmath7 thick lead nanofilms when the bottom of one of the relevant single - electron subbands approaches @xmath8 .",
    "thus , one can in general conclude that the multiband superconductors ( both , bulk and with quantum - confined induced subbands , see also refs .   and ) offer new important possibilities towards further understanding the physics of the bcs - bec crossover in solid - state materials .",
