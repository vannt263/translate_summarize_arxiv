    "ams is a general purpose high energy particle physics detector in space .",
    "the layout and description of the detector are presented in  @xcite .",
    "the key elements used in this measurement are the permanent magnet , the silicon tracker , four planes of time of flight ( tof ) scintillation counters , and the array of anticoincidence counters ( acc ) .",
    "ams also contains a transition radiation detector ( trd ) , a ring imaging erenkov detector ( rich ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "the central field of the magnet  @xcite is 1.4 kg . before flight , the field was measured in 120,000 locations to an accuracy of better than 2 g . on orbit ,",
    "the magnet temperature varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1c .",
    "the field strength is corrected with a measured temperature dependence of @xmath2c .",
    "the tracker  @xcite has nine layers , the first ( l1 ) at the top of the detector , the second ( l2 ) above the magnet , six ( l3 to l8 ) within the bore of the magnet , and the last ( l9 ) above the ecal .",
    "l2 to l8 constitute the inner tracker .",
    "the tracker accurately determines the trajectory of cosmic rays by multiple measurements of the coordinates with a resolution in each layer of 10@xmath3 m in the bending direction .",
    "together , the tracker and the magnet measure the rigidity @xmath4 of charged cosmic rays . the maximum detectable rigidity ( mdr ) is 2tv over the 3 m lever arm from l1 to l9 .",
    "each layer of the tracker also provides an independent measurement of the absolute value of the charge @xmath5 of the cosmic ray .",
    "the charge resolution of the layers of the inner tracker together is @xmath6 for @xmath7 particles .",
    "two planes of tof counters  @xcite are located above l2 and two planes are located below the magnet .",
    "the average time resolution of each counter for @xmath7 particles has been measured to be 160ps and the overall velocity ( @xmath8 ) resolution to be @xmath9% .",
    "this discriminates between upward- and downward - going particles .",
    "the coincidence of signal from the four tof planes together with the absence of signal from the acc provides a charged particle trigger .",
    "the coincidence of 3 out of the 4 tof layers with no acc requirement was instead used to provide an unbiased trigger .",
    "the unbiased trigger , prescaled by 1% , was used to measure the efficiency of the charged particle trigger .",
    "in the first 30 months ( @xmath10s ) ams collected @xmath11 cosmic ray events . due to the influence of the geomagnetic field",
    ", this collection time for primary cosmic rays increases with increasing rigidity becoming constant at @xmath12s above 30gv .    by selecting events to be downward going and to have a positive reconstructed track in the inner tracker with charge compatible with @xmath13 , @xmath14 events were obtained . in order to have the best resolution at the highest rigidities ,",
    "further selections are made by requiring the track to pass through l1 and l9 and to satisfy additional track fitting quality criteria such as a @xmath15 in the bending coordinate .",
    "in addition , to select only primary cosmic rays , well above the geomagnetic cutoff , the measured rigidity is required to be greater than 1.2 times the maximum geomagnetic cutoff within the ams field of view .",
    "the cutoff was calculated by backtracing  @xcite particles from the top of ams out to 50 earth s radii using the igrf  @xcite geomagnetic model .",
    "these procedures resulted in a sample of @xmath16 primary cosmic rays with @xmath17 .    since protons are the dominant component of cosmic rays , the selected sample has only small contributions of other particles , mainly deuterons which are not removed in this analysis .",
    "the deuteron contribution decreases with rigidity : at 1gv it is less than 2% and at 20gv it is 0.6%  @xcite .",
    "the sample also contains protons from nuclei which interact at the top of ams ( for example , in l1 or the trd ) . from the measured flux  @xcite and monte carlo simulation",
    "this contribution is 0.5% at 1gv decreasing to less than 0.1% at and above 10gv .",
    "contamination from @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite , overwhelmingly @xmath18 , was estimated to be less than 0.1% over the entire rigidity range .",
    "the background contributions from protons which originated in the interactions of nuclei at the top of ams and @xmath20 , both noticeable only below 2gv , are subtracted from the flux and the uncertainties are accounted for in the systematic errors .",
    "after selection , the isotropic proton flux @xmath21 for the @xmath22 rigidity bin @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of events corrected with the rigidity resolution function by means of the unfolding procedure described in details in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is the effective acceptance , @xmath27 is the trigger efficiency , and @xmath28 is the collection time . the proton flux was measured in 72 bins , @xmath29 to 72 , from 1gv to 1.8tv with bin widths chosen according to the rigidity resolution .",
    "the effective acceptance @xmath26 was calculated using monte carlo and then corrected for small differences found between the data and monte carlo event selection efficiencies .",
    "the trigger efficiency @xmath27 is measured from data with the unbiased trigger events .",
    "the trigger efficiency ranges from 90 to 95% .",
    "the 5 to 10% inefficiency is due to secondary @xmath30-rays in the magnetic field entering the acc .",
    "the monte carlo agrees with the measured trigger efficiency within 0.5% .",
    "the bin - to - bin migration of events was corrected using a rigidity resolution function obtained from monte carlo simulation and verified with test beam data  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies were made on systematic errors .",
    "the errors include uncertainties in the trigger efficiency , the acceptance , the background contamination , the geomagnetic cutoff factor , the event selection , the unfolding , the rigidity resolution function , and the absolute rigidity scale .",
    "the trigger efficiency error is dominated by the statistics available from the 1% prescaled unbiased event sample .",
    "it is negligible ( less than 0.1% ) below 500gv and reaches 1.5% at 1.8tv .",
    "the geomagnetic cutoff factor was varied from 1.0 to 1.4 and the resulting proton fluxes showed a systematic uncertainty of 2% at 1gv and negligible above 2gv . using the most recent igrf model  @xcite and the igrf model with external non - symmetric magnetic fields  @xcite",
    "does not introduce observable changes in the flux values nor in the systematic errors .",
    "the effective acceptance was corrected for small differences between the data and the monte carlo samples related to the event reconstruction and selection .",
    "together , the correction was found to be 5% at 1gv decreasing below 2% above 10gv , while the corresponding systematic uncertainty is less than 1% above 2gv .    the detector is mostly made of carbon and aluminum .",
    "the corresponding inelastic cross sections of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are known to within 10% at 1gv and 4% at 300gv  @xcite , and 7% at 1.8tv from model estimations  @xcite .",
    "the inelastic cross sections are used in the monte carlo based estimation of the effective acceptance and , to estimate the systematic error due to the uncertainty in the inelastic cross sections , dedicated samples of protons were simulated with the @xmath31 and @xmath32 cross sections varied by @xmath3310% . from the analysis of these samples together with the current knowledge of the cross sections ,",
    "a systematic error of 1% at 1gv , 0.6% from 10 to 300gv , and 0.8% at 1.8tv was obtained .",
    "the rigidity resolution function was verified with data from both the iss and the test beam . for this , the residuals between the hit coordinates measured in tracker layers l1 and l9 and those obtained from the track fit using the information from only the inner tracker l2 to l8 were compared between data and simulation . in order to validate the alignment of the external layers , the difference between the rigidity measured using the information from l1 to l8 and from l2 to l9 was compared between data and simulation . the resulting uncertainty on the mdr",
    "was estimated to be 5% .",
    "the corresponding unfolding errors were obtained by varying the width of the gaussian core of the resolution function by 5% and the amplitude of the non - gaussian tails by @xmath3420% over the entire rigidity range and found to be 1% below 200gv and 3% at 1.8tv .",
    "there are two contributions to the systematic uncertainty on the rigidity scale .",
    "the first is due to residual tracker misalignment . from the 400gev/_c",
    "_ test beam data it was measured to be less then 1/300tv@xmath35 . for the iss data this error was estimated by comparing the @xmath36 ratio for electron and positron events , where @xmath37 is the energy measured with the ecal and @xmath38 is the momentum measured with the tracker , see  @xcite for details .",
    "it was found to be @xmath39tv@xmath35 , limited by the current high energy positron statistics .",
    "the second systematic error on the rigidity scale arises from the magnetic field map measurement ( 0.25% ) and its temperature corrections ( 0.1% ) . taken in quadrature and weighted by the measured flux ,",
    "this amounts to less than 0.5% systematic error on the flux for rigidities above 2gv .",
    "the measured proton @xmath40 flux including statistical and systematic errors is displayed figure  [ fig : proton ] and tabulated in  @xcite as a function of rigidity at the top of the ams detector .",
    "the contributions to the systematic errors is described in details in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : proton ] shows the flux as a function of rigidity with total errors where the rigidity points are placed along the abscissa at r calculated for a flux @xmath41  @xcite .      a power law",
    "@xmath42 with a constant spectral index @xmath43 , @xmath4 in gv and @xmath44 a normalization factor , does not fit the flux reported in this work and shown in figure  [ fig : proton ] at the 99.9% c.l .",
    "for @xmath45 gv . applying solar modulation in the force field approximation @xcite also does not fit the data at the 99.9% c.l . for @xmath45",
    "the flux was therefore fitted with a modified spectral index @xcite @xmath46^s\\ ] ] where @xmath47 quantifies the smoothness of the transition of the spectral index from @xmath43 for rigidities below the characteristic transition rigidity @xmath48 to @xmath49 for rigidities above @xmath48 .",
    "fitting over the range 45gv to 1.8tv yields a @xmath50 and parameters values are listened in table  [ table ] .",
    "the first error quoted fit - err , takes into account the statistical and uncorrelated systematic errors from the flux reported in  @xcite .",
    "the second sys - err is the error from the remaining systematic errors , namely from the rigidity resolution function and unfolding , and from the absolute rigidity scale , with their bin - to - bin correlations accounted for using the migration matrix .",
    "the third sol - err is the uncertainty due to the variation of the solar potential @xmath51 to 0.62 gv  @xcite .",
    "the fit confirms that above 45gv the flux is incompatible with a single spectral index at the @xmath52 c.l .",
    "the fit is shown in figure  [ fig : fit ] .     as a function of rigidity @xmath4 .",
    "the solid curve indicates the fit of eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] to the data . for illustration",
    ", the dashed curve uses the same fit values but with @xmath53 set to zero.[fig : fit],width=302 ]    for illustration , the fit result with @xmath53 set to zero is also shown in figure  [ fig : fit ] . to obtain the detailed variation of @xmath43 with rigidity in a model independent way , the spectral index is calculated from @xmath54/d[\\log(r ) ] \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ] over independent rigidity intervals above 8.48gv , with a variable width to have sufficient sensitivity to determine @xmath43 .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : gamma ] .",
    "the spectral index varies with rigidity and it is progressively harder with rigidity above @xmath34100gv .      while at rigidity @xmath45 gv the spectra remains stable versus time , the low rigidity range exhibits variations strongly reflecting the solar activity effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : flux3d ] displays the proton flux versus time from may 2011 to may 2016 and rigidity from 1 gv to 10 gv . in the first five years of operations ams was collecting data during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 through its maximum and toward the minimum .",
    "the proton spectra was gradually decreasing reaching the minimum between the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014 . in 2015",
    "the proton flux started to recover : at the end of may 2016 , ams proton flux was higher that the one measured at the beginning of the mission .",
    "in addition to the overall modulation effect , the ams proton flux exhibits structures related to strong solar events i.e. coronal mass ejections and forbush decreases as already reported in  @xcite .      in conclusion ,",
    "a precision measurement of the proton flux in primary cosmic rays with rigidity from 1 gv to 1.8 tv was presented . at high rigidities the flux deviates from a single power law and progressively hardens above 100 gv . at low rigidities ,",
    "the proton flux is modulated by the solar activity which reached its maximum in 2014 .",
    "in addition to the overall solar modulation effect , the low rigidity flux shows structures related to short time scale solar activity that are usually more pronounced during solar maximum .",
    "measurement of the time dependent solar modulation of primary cosmic rays fluxes with ams on the iss will be the subject of future publication .    this work has been supported by acknowledged person and institutions in @xcite and by national science foundation early career under grant nsf ags-1455202 , wyle laboratories , inc . under grant nas 9 - 02078 , and nasa and earth space science fellowship under grant 15-helio15f-0005 .",
