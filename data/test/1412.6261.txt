    "the powerful sources of x - rays are now becoming the indispensable tools in science , technology and medicine .",
    "nowadays , the high quality x - ray and xuv light is delivered by the synchrotron radiation ( sr ) sources .",
    "these installations are typically large - scale and include a radio - frequency electron accelerator combined with an undulator assembled from the permanent magnets , and the devices for the beam manipulation ( quadruples , chicanes , steerers etc ) . the last generation of sr sources  the x - ray free electron lasers ( xfel )  have reached the record gw powers for the ngstrm wavelengths operating in the coherent regime @xcite .",
    "this regime is provided by the the high stability of beam - undulator interaction , when the individually emitting electrons get progressively involved into the process of stimulated scattering and amplify the light in the collective fashion @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of sr produced by an individual electron is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the undulator period and its strength parameter , and @xmath3 is the electrons lorentz factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 defines the efficiency of the undulator , i.e. its capability to deviate the particles transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath2 is typically proportional to the field amplitude and the period , e.g. for a conventional linear magnetic undulator @xmath4 } \\lambda_u \\text{[cm]}$ ] .",
    "therefore the maximal x - ray photon energy @xmath5 , is limited by the minimal @xmath1 and the energy of the electron . in the conventional sr sources ,",
    "the size of the undulator magnet which provides sufficiently strong magnetic field is around centimeter , which makes it difficult to reach the sub - ngstrm radiation wavelengths , requiring larger and more expensive accelerators .",
    "alternatively , a number of currently explored schemes propose to collide electron beam with strong optical laser radiation @xcite .",
    "such compton sources can provide a very short , micrometer undulation period with sufficiently large @xmath2 values .",
    "the rate of the amplification in fels is typically determined by the parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the peak flux defined by the current @xmath8 and the transverse size of the electron beam @xmath9 @xcite . since amplification decreases with @xmath1 , the efficient operation of the optical - based xfels requires a relatively long interaction distances which imposes severe limitations on the beam quality . as a consequence , while such an idea is being discussed in a number of theoretical works @xcite , any practical realization remains beyond current expectations .",
    "one possible solution to improve the concept of the optical - based xfel , is to replace the conventional rf linac with the laser plasma accelerator ( lpa ) @xcite .",
    "the technology of lpa has already proved its capability to deliver pico - coulomb femtosecond beams of mev electrons @xcite , and has now reached the gev level @xcite .",
    "the incoherent undulator radiation produced by the laser accelerated electrons was recently observed experimentally @xcite and the prospects for coherent amplification of this radiation were discussed @xcite .",
    "although the laser plasma accelerators now provide the necessary high electron flux , the level of collimation and monoenergeticity required for the x - rays amplification yet remains challenging .    in our work",
    "we tackle this problem considering a scheme based on a specific configuration of the optical undulator  the optical lattice .",
    "the lattice results from the overlap of two identical side laser beams and represents a spatially , transversally modulated electromagnetic field structure .",
    "the interest for such a structure and its interaction with electron beams originates from the works of p.l .",
    "kapitza and p.a.m .",
    "dirac back in 1933 @xcite , and was later revised in a number of works @xcite . at the same time",
    "appeared the idea to use the electron slow motion in the optical lattice as a low frequency light source @xcite .",
    "recently we have focused our attention to electron light scattering in the lattice for coherent amplification of short wavelength radiation @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of the transverse optical lattice is that it both wiggles the electrons in the varying laser field , and its spatial modulations act on the electrons via the ponderomotive force thereby trapping them in the potential channels @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "such electron guiding prevents electrons from diverging along one direction @xcite , thus , partially preserving the electron flux . on the other hand ,",
    "potential channels affect the collective behavior of the electrons predisposing them to a new mechanism of amplification similar to the stimulated raman scattering @xcite . similarly to the traveling - wave technique proposed for the thomson scattering in @xcite , the optical lattice can co - propagate with electrons for a long distance and therefore may provide a stable amplification .",
    "in the present work , we revise the physics of x - rays amplification in the electron beam trapped in the optical lattice . for this",
    "we develop a self - consistent kinetic model in [ sec1 ] , and with its help describe the growth of electromagnetic signal in the analytical approach and by using a simple numerical integration ( see [ sec2 ] ) . in [ sec3 ] , the theoretical results are compared to the three - dimensional numerical modeling performed with the unaveraged spectral free electron laser code plares @xcite .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in [ sec4 ] .",
    "we describe interaction of the relativistic electrons with the optical lattice and the scattered radiation . the theoretical model is based on the vlasov kinetic equation and the equation for electromagnetic potential :    [ set0 ] @xmath10 @xmath11    in present study",
    ", we normalize frequencies and wavenumbers to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wavelength of the laser . the distances and time in [ set0 ]",
    "are measured in the units @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the electron velocities and momenta are normalized to the speed of light @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , and the vector potential is in the units of @xmath19 . in this convention , the electron distribution function ( edf )",
    "is normalized as @xmath20 , where the electron density @xmath21 is in the units of its critical value , @xmath22 .",
    "the beam of electrons travels at a relativistic velocity , @xmath23 , in the overlap of two identical laser pulses incident symmetrically with the angle @xmath24 ( see [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the vector potential @xmath25 in [ set0 ] accounts for the lattice field ,    [ set1 ] @xmath26 and the signal wave @xmath27 , associated with the scattered radiation .",
    "this signal co - propagates with electrons : @xmath28    and its amplitude @xmath29 is assumed to be small , so in our analysis we retain only linear terms on @xmath29 .",
    "one approximation commonly used to describe the motion of the charged particles in a strong laser field , is to divide this motion into the `` fast '' and `` slow '' parts .",
    "the fast reaction of the electrons is to follow oscillations of the electromagnetic field directly . on the other hand ,",
    "the particles are also driven by the period - averaged ponderomotive force , defined by the field spatial gradients . the optical lattice field in [ lattice:0 ] has the transverse gradient , which creates the ponderomotive force along @xmath30-axis :    [ set2 ] @xmath31 and produces a series of the potential channels with the widths @xmath32 .    in presence of the signal wave ( [ signal:0 ] ) ,",
    "its interference with the lattice produces a beat - wave in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this wave acts on the electrons via the ponderomotive force : @xmath33   \\nonumber\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is calculated in the reference frame of electron beam ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and then translated to the laboratory system .",
    "the unperturbed state of the electron beam trapped in the lattice potential is defined only by the transverse ponderomotive force [ ponder:0 ] .",
    "the characteristics of the kinetic equation ( [ set0:1 ] ) in this case can be written as : @xmath34 and they define the particles trajectories , along which the initial edf remains constant .",
    "the first equation of [ character:0 ] represents the energy conservation condition , @xmath35 and , neglecting the variations of the electron lorentz factor , we may calculate the orbits of the electrons as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a jacobi elliptic function defined as an inverse of elliptic integral @xmath38 . here",
    "we have also denoted a normalized excursion @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a frequency of the small - amplitude oscillations .",
    "the phase @xmath41 is defined by the initial coordinates and momentum of the particle .",
    "if @xmath42 , the electron is trapped , and it oscillates in a channel of the optical lattice with the frequency : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , is an quarter period of elliptic integral .    the first approximation in [ betatron_freq ] was previously presented in @xcite , and its accuracy is better than 99% for @xmath45 .",
    "the alternative expression ( in the leftmost part of [ betatron_freq ] ) is derived by expanding @xmath46 into the series , and it retains a 98% accuracy for @xmath47 .",
    "the latter is more convenient for the analytical developments , and we will use it further with the electron orbits [ orbits:1 ] approximated by sinusoids .",
    "finally , the set of electron trajectories in the @xmath48 phase - plane will read : @xmath49    for a simple model analysis one can assume homogeneous electron distributions in the transverse phase plane , where the particles are trapped , and in the longitudinal direction , which is not affected by the lattice field .",
    "the electron distribution function in this case reads : @xmath50 is a maximal electron density , and @xmath51 is a longitudinal energy spread of electrons .",
    "the maximal excursion is limited by the potential scale , @xmath52 .",
    "the force ( [ ponder:1 ] ) associated with the signal wave acts on the particles , and rearranges their longitudinal positions , thus generating the perturbation of edf @xmath53 . in its turn",
    ", this perturbation acts back on the signal field through the electron current along @xmath54-axis in the right hand side of [ set0:2 ] .",
    "such coupling may provide a resonant interaction between electron and electromagnetic modes resulting in their amplification or damping similarly to the stimulated raman scattering @xcite .    during the early , linear stage of interaction , the amplitude of the signal wave and the edf perturbations are small @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the current @xmath57 , associated with the resonant interaction in [ set0:2 ] , includes the generating term @xmath58 , and the term @xmath59 , which is responsible for the dispersion of the signal resulting from its interaction with the space - charge plasma waves . in the simplest case",
    ", we may neglect this dispersion as well as the diffraction of the amplified wave , therefore , assuming a plane transverse profile . keeping only the first order resonant perturbation terms , we write the signal wave equation as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is related to the electron density perturbations as @xmath62\\,.\\ ] ]    to study the interaction of the electromagnetic field with relativistic electrons , it is convenient to introduce the coordinates which follow the center of the electron beam @xmath63 .",

    "note that , it is the force @xmath70 , which produces the modulations of electron density  the bunched structure .",
    "these modulations propagate with the velocity @xmath71 , and the sign of @xmath72 defines the propagation direction . in case of @xmath73 , the modulations co - propagate with the electron beam and accelerate the particles , thereby draining the energy of electromagnetic field .",
    "otherwise , if the signal is down - shifted , @xmath74 , the electrons give the energy to the wave amplifying it . in what follows",
    ", we will consider only this growing mode , always assuming @xmath75 .",
    "let us describe the dynamics of @xmath61 by perturbing the kinetic equation ( [ set0:2 ] ) and averaging it over the lattice field period : @xmath76 \\delta f = -f^{(1 ) }   \\partial_{p_z}f\\,,\\ ] ] where only the first order terms are retained .",
    "the operator in the left hand side is simply the time derivative @xmath77 calculated along the trajectories ( [ trajects ] ) .",
    "substituting these trajectories into [ vlasov:1 ] and considering the model edf [ edf:0 ] , the integration of [ vlasov:1 ] over the momenta may be simplified as : @xmath78 where we denote @xmath79 , and the function : @xmath80 describes dynamics of the electron density perturbations driven by the ponderomotive forces .",

    "considering the second approximation in [ betatron_freq ] , one may qualitatively expect that the electron mode spectrum after averaging will depend on @xmath30 as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",

    "partially this is justified by the fact that the coulomb repelling for the relativistic beams becomes weak with higher @xmath106 .",
    "however , for a sufficiently long interaction time these effects may become important , and will be considered in future studies .",
