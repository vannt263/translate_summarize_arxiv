    "structure in rm on angular scales of tens of degrees becomes visible because of the high sampling density ( @xmath67 rm per square degree ) .",
    "the rm density on the sky in our data is not sufficient to recognize rm structures on angular scales less than a few degrees , but structure on small angular scales does affect the variance of rm because it introduces differences from one line of sight to another .",

    "the mean distance between an rm measurement and its closest neighbor in our data is @xmath72 .",
    "sfs can probe rm variance on smaller angular scales than this depending on the number of source pairs available to evaluate the variance with reasonable confidence . for our analysis ,",
    "the smallest angular scale is taken to be the scale for which we have a minimum of 20 source pairs , or @xmath73 , whichever comes first .",
    "the largest angular scale we consider for the sfs is @xmath74 , so the rm gradient related to the large - scale magnetic field does not contribute significantly to d.    all possible sources of variance contribute to the amplitude of the sf .",
    "we may write d as a sum of variance terms that we consider statistically independent @xmath75 with @xmath76 the variance of rm originating inside the source , @xmath77 the variance in rm originating in the intergalactic medium , for different lines of sight separated by angle @xmath78 , @xmath79 the variance of rm originating in the interstellar medium for lines of sight separated by angle @xmath78 , and @xmath80 the variance resulting from measurement errors and noise .",
    "the variance @xmath80 should be subtracted from @xmath68 to obtain the sum of the three terms of astrophysical interest ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this term was calculated from the errors on the rms contributing to pairs separated by angular distance @xmath78 .",
    "each term in the summation of equation  [ sf - eq ] contains differences @xmath81 ( @xmath82 indices of data in the rm catalog ) . for each pair of sources included in the summation ,",
    "the variance added by noise is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the standard errors for @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "this assumes that the error bars in the rm data base provide a realistic estimate of the measurement errors .",
    "we defer this discussion to section  [ discussion - sec ] . in principle @xmath80",
    "can depend on @xmath78 , but for the sfs presented here , it is virtually constant .",
    "the median error in our complete rm catalog is @xmath88 , so the error term can be a significant source of variance and it affects the slope of the sf on small angular scales . unless stated otherwise , sfs in this paper or derived properties such as amplitude and slope have been corrected for variance associated with measurement errors .",
    "figure  [ sf_sim - fig ] shows a simulation of the effect of noise on a sf , and the noise - subtracted sf .",
    "the simulated data consisted of 1978 points drawn at random from an image with a random field with input sf with slope 0.6 kindly provided by v. uritsky . for figure",
    "[ sf_sim - fig]a , measurement errors for each data point were simulated by first drawing a standard deviation from a uniform distribution between 0.4 and 2.0 ( data units ) , then drawing a number from a gaussian distribution with the chosen standard deviation , to be added to the actual data value .",
    "the standard deviation itself was recorded as the error bar for each rm .",
    "the figure shows the sf as observed ( upper solid curve with dots ) , the noise power @xmath80 evaluated from the error bars of rm ( dashed curve ) , and the sf corrected for noise power ( points with error bars ) , compared with the sf of the same 1978 noiseless data points ( lower solid curve ) . for figure  [ sf_sim - fig]b ,",
    "the same set of original data points was used , but the standard deviations of the rm errors were drawn independently from a uniform distribution between 0.8 to 4.0 data units .",
    "this on average doubles the measurement errors compared with the situation shown in figure  [ sf_sim - fig]a , and quadruples the level of the noise power in equation  [ variance - eq ] .",
    "we retrieve the input sf in the simulation shown in figure  [ sf_sim - fig ] and other simulations that included sfs of various slopes and noise levels .",
    "these simulations confirmed our evaluation of the noise power even though the errors in individual rms varied by a factor 5 .",
    "on the smallest angular scales , we see occasional large variation in the data after noise subtraction .",
    "this is to be expected , because the contribution of the noise to the total variance is large , but our estimate of the noise power is uncertain because relatively few source pairs with small angular separation exist in the catalog .",
    "we can easily identify such points and remove them from consideration .",
    "the subtraction of the sf of the noise is a statistical correction that is more accurate for larger samples .",
    "the sf of the measurement errors is not necessarily flat , for instance in the case of periodic variations in the noise of a mosaicking survey with widely separated field centers , or in the case of a deep survey of a small area of the sky where the noise increases towards the edge of the survey area ( affecting all source pairs with large angular separation ) . in our analysis",
    "we do _ not _ assume that the sf of the noise is flat , or that all rm error are equal .",
    "we calculate the sf of the noise for each @xmath78 from the actual error bars of all included rms .",

    "the gradual trend in slope if high - latitude sfs with longitude mimics the boundaries of the high - latitude polarized emission described by @xcite .",
    "in the first galactic quadrant ( @xmath153 ) , the drop in polarized intensity at @xmath154 and @xmath155 noted by @xcite corresponds with rm variance of @xmath156 north and south of the galactic plane , although we see extended polarized emission in some areas with rm variance up to @xmath157 .",

    "rms from polarized extragalactic sources probe the entire line of sight from the source to the observer .",
    "most extragalactic sources experience relatively little internal faraday rotation , and intergalactic faraday rotation is believed to be substantially smaller than the intrinsic rm variance of the extragalactic sources . with the exception of some sources with high internal faraday rotation , most of the rm originates from the section of the line of sight inside our own galaxy .",
    "rm amplitude also increases significantly towards the galactic plane .",
    "although the rm is an integral along the line of sight , a single object can contribute significantly .",
    "the gum nebula ( distance @xmath168 pc * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contributes significantly to the rm , even though the line of sight towards the gum nebula intersects the inner galaxy , where the electron density is high over a line of sight of several kpc @xcite .",
    "the orion star forming region , also at a distance of approximately 400 pc @xcite , is at higher latitude , so its background is a relatively short line of sight through the galaxy .",
    "the line of sight through the galaxy is much shorter for high - latitude sources , and structures in the local ism may affect the rm significantly .",
    "some high - latitude hii  regions were identified as such , consistent with earlier results that showed that individual hii  regions can have a significant impact on rm @xcite . we have found evidence that region c@xmath20 is associated with a nearby cloud revealed by its absorption of soft x - rays from the galactic halo that is at least partially neutral because it is visible in hi  emission .",

    "one of these is the orion - eridanus superbubble ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 @xcite , visible in emission in figure  [ ha_rm - fig ] , and in absorption in figure  [ rosat_rm - fig ] .",
    "these filaments contribute to the amplitude of rm sfs on large angular scales , increasing the sf slope @xmath117 .",
    "the overarching picture that emerges is one of rm structure in the local ( @xmath177 few kpc )",
    "ism on large scales is mostly associated with bubble walls , hii  regions , and local clouds , region @xmath178 ( table  [ sfregions - tab ] ) being a possible exception . if this is representative for an average few kpc line of sight through the galaxy , the rm variance added by structures on scales of a few hundred pc should contribute significantly to the total variance in rm at low galactic latitudes .",
    "if bubble walls contribute significantly , models of rm variance should include a correlation between field strength and density on scales of a few hundred pc .",
    "@xcite derived sfs at the ngp and sgp caps ( latitude @xmath179 ) based on 354 and 319 rms respectively .",

    "@xcite suggested that the differences between the samples are related to multiple rm components in some sources that can not be resolved in the two - frequency data of @xcite , but they did not provide specific examples where this would be the case . while it is true that the two - frequency data in @xcite can not resolve non - linearity in the relation between polarization angle and @xmath180 , rotation measure synthesis with limited @xmath180 coverage , as in the sample of @xcite has its limitations",
    "it was recently pointed out by l. rudnick et al .",
    "( unpublished ) that rm synthesis can provide erroneous solutions in a simple system with just two discrete rm components .    in order to gain a better understanding of the difference between sfs derived by @xcite and those derived here , we must first compare the rm samples in more detail .",
    "the median error for sources common to both rm catalogs is @xmath181 in @xcite , @xmath122 in the ngp region of @xcite , and @xmath182 in the sgp region of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ rm_rm_comp - fig ] shows scatter plots of rms matched between the two samples , subdivided into rms with error @xmath183 ( panels a and c ) , and all other rms ( panels b and d ) .",
    "when considering only rms with small errors , we see a correlation between the two datasets at both galactic poles ( figure  [ rm_rm_comp - fig ] a and c ) . the larger scatter in the sgp area found by @xcite",
    "is related to rms with larger error bars , in either @xcite , or @xcite , or both .",
    "we do _ not _ calculate a correlation coefficient , because the correlation coefficient between independent rm surveys of low - rm sources _ must _ be small .",
    "unresolved multiple rm components may affect both surveys in a similar way , and thus introduce correlated systematic errors without increasing the scatter in figure  [ rm_rm_comp - fig ] , but still raise the amplitude of sfs derived from both data sets .",
    "figure  [ rm_rm_comp - fig ] a and c both show significant rm signal .",
    "the scatter in these relations provides an estimate of the variance introduced by measurement errors .",
    "we examine the subsets with small errors shown in figure  [ rm_rm_comp - fig ] a and c , as well as the complete sample . for the subsets with small errors ,",
    "the total variance is @xmath184 in the north and @xmath185 in the south .",

    "the total variance is @xmath188 in the north and @xmath189 in the south , while the error bars account for @xmath190 and @xmath184 respectively .",
    "the stated errors underestimate the true variance in the correlation of rms common to both samples , but more so if the stated errors are small .",
    "the rm errors in @xcite were estimated by error propagation of the noise in the stokes @xmath191 and @xmath192 images , while the errors in @xcite were estimated as half the width of the rm spread function divided by the signal to noise ratio in polarization .",
    "the error estimates in both surveys converge to zero as the signal to noise ratio in polarization increases without bound .",
    "perhaps the true errors do not converge as rapidly as assumed .",
    "before we consider the effect of this underestimation of errors on the amplitude of sf at the galactic poles , we first consider another aspect of the error statistics of the data .",
    "figure  [ rm_error - fig ] shows the stated errors as a function of rm amplitude for the ngp and sgp regions of the @xcite sample .",
    "black dots represent rms used in the construction of sfs , and gray crosses respresent rejected rms . while the median error in figure  [ rm_error - fig]a is larger , figure  [ rm_error - fig]b contains data with large rm errors that contribute to the increased scatter in figure  [ rm_rm_comp - fig]d .",
    "rms with amplitude more than @xmath193 in figure  [ rm_error - fig]b are much more likely to have a large error , introducing a correlation between rm error and rm amplitude : the sgp data of @xcite are heteroskedastic .",
    "the highest rm amplitudes ( a few percent of the total sample ) are rejected in both regions , but the distribution of rejected rms is more skewed toward high rm amplitude in the south ( figure  [ rm_error - fig]b ) .",
    "some rms in @xcite were rejected in order to eliminate agns with strong internal faraday rotation , and to minimize the effect of known galactic and extragalactic structures .",
    "this approach is preferred if one wishes to determine the intrinsic rm variance of agn - powered radio sources , or investigate small - scale turbulence at high galactic latitude .",
    "this paper deals with the complete rm foregound .",
    "figure  [ taylor_error - fig ] shows the rm errors in relation to rm amplitude for our data in the ngp and sgp regions .",

    "what does this all mean for the sf amplitudes at the galactic poles ?",
    "figure  [ sf_poles_comp - fig ] shows rm sfs at the ngp and sgp .",
    "the gray sfs were made with the censored data of @xcite ( 354 rms at the ngp and 319 rms at the sgp ) .",
    "we find a smaller amplitude than @xcite , because these authors underestimated the noise power by approximately a factor 2 .",
    "the problem was identified and the authors confirmed they recover the sf shown in figure  [ sf_poles_comp - fig ] ( a. mao , private communication ) .",
    "the black points in figure  [ sf_poles_comp - fig ] show sfs made with the complete sample of @xcite .",
    "the origin of the large scatter for @xmath194 in figure  [ sf_poles_comp - fig]a was discussed in section  [ strucfunc - sec ] ( figure  [ sf_sim - fig ] ) . using the complete sample of @xcite",
    ", we confirm that the sf in the sgp region is a factor @xmath3 higher than in the ngp region , but both sfs in figure  [ sf_poles_comp - fig ] have a somewhat smaller amplitude than those in figure  [ sfpoles - fig ] .",
    "both data sets suggest a small upward slope of the sf in the ngp region . in table",
    "[ sfregions - tab ] we list @xmath195 , while @xcite found @xmath196 . for the sgp region",
    "we find @xmath197 , while @xcite found @xmath198 .",
    "if we _ assume _ that the noise power in our sfs is really a factor 1.5 higher than that calculated from the rm errors , we would retrieve the black curves in figure  [ sf_poles_comp - fig ] .",
    "this would be equivalent with the rm errors being underestimated by a factor 1.22 in @xcite , and account for the variance in the comparison of rms from the two surveys .",
    "while this appears a plausible explanation of the difference , the actual comparison may be more complicated .",
    "this analysis assumes that figure  [ rm_rm_comp - fig ] reveals all rm errors , while it does not reveal possible systematic errors common to both surveys that may increase sf amplitude .",
    "another question is the nature of the sources in @xcite for which no reliable rm could be found ( 6% of their data in the ngp region and 28% in the sgp region .",
    "it is encouraging that we find consistency between sfs from independent data sets , after accounting for all noise power traced by direct comparison of rms common to both surveys .",
    "this consistency requires just a @xmath199 increase in the errors quoted by @xcite ( in a low - rm environment ) , corresponding with only a few @xmath17 .",
    "it suggests that either the effect of multiple rm components on the data of @xcite is quite small , or the data from @xcite are affected in the same way for most sources .",
    "however , such a systematic error should still increase the amplitude of the sfs , assuming it is uncorrelated between sources .",
    "from the total amplitude of the sfs at high latitude , we estimate that any such systematic error should be smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "our analysis shows that both rm surveys point indicate a larger rm variance in the direction of the sgp than in the direction of the ngp .",
    "our sfs at intermediate galactic latitude show the same trend , and these are less sensitive to the amplitude of the noise power because it contributes much less to the total variance .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite reported a higher mean rm in the south than in the north .",
    "@xcite found this to be the case in the entire southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "variance in rm originates from fluctuations in electron density and magnetic field on a range of scales in the ism , including hiiregions , bubbles , turbulence , and possibly also molecular clouds with a small ionized fraction but a strong magnetic field .",
    "the variance in rm should be approximately proportional to the length of the line of sight through the galaxy @xcite .",
    "figure  [ sf2_skydist_ha - fig ] shows that the amplitude of sfs on an angular scale @xmath200 follows the distribution of h@xmath0 intensity in the galactic plane .",
    "the highest amplitudes at low galactic latitude are found in the direction of the local arm ( @xmath201 ) and other regions along the galactic plane .",
    "the peak in rm variance at @xmath202 ) occurs in a region of the galactic plane with strong extinction at visible wavelengths .",
    "the enhance variance in the gum region is clearly extented in figure  [ sf2_skydist_ha - fig ] with morphology similar to h@xmath0 intensity .",
    "the low - latitude rm variance is smaller in the direction of the galactic anti - center , where the line of sight through the galaxy is shorter .",
    "these observations are consistent with the expectation that variance in rm increases with the length of the line of sight through the galaxy @xcite .",
    "higher electron density and stronger turbulence related to more intense star formation in the inner galaxy probably also contribute to the high rm variance for lines of sight through the inner galaxy .",
    "the outer scale in rm variance associated with interarm regions , but not with spiral arms reported by @xcite and @xcite indicates that besides line - of - sight distance , the local conditions are also important .    the difference in rm variance between the galactic northern and southern hemispheres ( figure  [ sf2_skydist_ha - fig ] and table  [ sfregions - tab ] ) is particularly interesting . assuming the intrinsic rm variance of extragalactic sources to be @xmath203 ( equation  [ variance - eq ] ) ,",
    "the rm variance introduced by the galactic foreground is 202 @xmath204 at the ngp , and 419 @xmath204 at the sgp ( 120 @xmath204 and 307 @xmath204 respectively using sfs from figure  [ sf_poles_comp - fig ] ) .",
    "the rm variance near the sgp originating from the galactic foreground is therefore a factor 2 larger than the galactic rm variance near the ngp .",
    "the difference in variance is equivalent with an additional source of rm variation with amplitude @xmath205 in the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "the sun is located 20 pc from the galactic mid - plane in the direction of the ngp .",
    "this distance is too small compared with the scale height of the ionized gas to make a significant difference in rm variance .",
    "it is more likely that we see a local asymmetry of density or magnetic field , or both with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite also found a factor @xmath3 difference in the mean rm of the ngp and the sgp , while @xcite found a significant positive rm at the sgp but not at the ngp .",
    "the slope of the sf is higher near the galactic plane with most values in the range from 0.4 to 0.8 and excesses up to 1.3 in the direction of two nearby hii  regions ( @xmath61 oph and the gum nebula ) .",
    "the slope of our sfs ( table  [ sfregions - tab ] ) is generally smaller than the 5/3 slope expected for kolmogorov turbulence @xcite , to the smallest angular scales probed by our data ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "@xcite found rm sf slopes @xmath207 in the nearly face - on galaxy ngc 6946 on scales up to 6 kpc , which is in the range of values of @xmath117 in table  [ sfregions - tab ] .    if a change in slope occurs in the range of angular scales probed by the current data ( @xmath208 ) , the slope on larger angular scales is usually smaller .",
    "a change in sf slope is sometimes interpreted as a physical scale in the turbulence probed by rm variance , that could be an outer scale length if the sf becomes flat on large scales .",
    "an implicit assumption is that the rm variance traces stochastic variations of electron density and magnetic field related to turbulence in the magneto - ionized ism .",
    "if deterministic structure , e.g. an hii  region that may or may not be detectable in current h@xmath0 surveys , or a meso - scale structure in the magnetic field , contributes significantly to the variation of rm with position over the area for which the sf is evaluated , the shape of the sf may reflect the angular scale of the ionized structure , not the turbulence along the line of sight .",
    "the present data suggest that this may be true in some directions .",
    "the steepest sfs at low latitude are associated with bright extended hii  regions in figure  [ sf2_skydist_ha - fig ] .",
    "figure  [ conditional_rm - fig ] also shows rm structure on angular scales @xmath209 with amplitude of a few tens of @xmath17 , sufficient to affect the slope of the sf between @xmath210 and @xmath74 . sampling with a denser rm grid",
    "can reveal such structures , as in the case of the rm anomaly in cygnus @xcite .",
    "future wide - area rm surveys with the arecibo radio telescope ( galgacts ) , the australian ska pathfinder askap ( possum ) , and with the square kilometre array will provide denser sampling that may reveal underlying structure that affects the slope of our sfs , while not recognizable in the present data .",
    "model sfs by @xcite and @xcite that assume a turbulent kolmogorov power spectrum for density and magnetic field , predict a flat sf at low latitude on angular scales @xmath211 as the number of turbulent cells in the line of sight increases .",
    "these models explore angular scales much smaller than those probed here .",
    "we see a general increase in sf slope towards the galactic plane , contrary to the expectation of a smaller slope expected by @xcite .",
    "as noted in figure  [ sf2_skydist_ha - fig ] , the lack of a strong longitude dependence of sf slope , and its wider distribution with galactic latitude suggest that the slope of sfs on larger angular scales is affected by the local interstellar medium .",
    "this suggests that local structure not represented in the models of @xcite may be responsible for the steep slope of the sfs at low latitude .",
    "rms s of extragalactic sources are affected by faraday rotation along the entire line of sight from the source to the observer , but mostly in the galaxy .",
    "depolarization of diffuse emission extends to @xmath212 . at this latitude ,",
    "the line of sight through the galactic ism is approximately twice as long as the line of sight towards the galactic poles . adopting a scale height of the warm ionized medium @xmath213 kpc @xcite",

    "<S> structure functions ( sfs ) of rm are presented for selected areas , and maps of sf amplitude and slope across the sky are compared with h@xmath0 intensity and diffuse polarized intensity . </S>",
    "<S> rm variance on an angular scale of @xmath1 is correlated with length of the line of sight through the galaxy , with a contribution from local structures . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the sfs is less concentrated to the galactic plane and less correlated with length of the line of sight through the galaxy , suggesting a more local origin for rm structure on angular scales @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the rm variance is a factor @xmath3 higher towards the sgp than towards the ngp , reflecting a more wide - spread asymmetry between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres . </S>",
    "<S> depolarization of diffuse galactic synchrotron emission at latitudes @xmath4 can be explained largely by faraday dispersion related to small - scale variance in rm , but the errors allow a significant contribution from differential faraday rotation along the line of sight . </S>"
