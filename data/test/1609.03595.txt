    "therefore , merger history of galaxies is important to understand present - day galaxies .",
    "since mergers cause distortions in the morphology of the system , visual inspections of images are often used to trace recent mergers .",
    "deep images are therefore essential for detecting evidence of mergers and interactions .",
    "deep images reveal that galaxies have assembled substantial fraction of their mass via mergers even in recent epochs ( van dokkum 2005 ; tal et al . 2009 ; kaviraj et al . 2010b ; sheen et al .",

    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) allows us to access 2d spatially - resolved velocity fields , so the analyses that are used to detect features in an image can be applied to ifs data as well . as we visually define peculiar morphologies using images , kinematically distinct features ( e.g. , kinematically distinct cores , counter - rotating cores , and double peaks in velocity dispersion )",

    "several techniques quantifying peculiarities in gas and stellar kinematics have been applied to large datasets from various surveys ( shapiro et al .",
    "2008 ; krajnovi@xmath2 et al .",
    "2011 ) . a recent study by bloom et al .",
    "( 2016 , submitted ) shows that morphologically disturbed galaxies correlate with asymmetry in gas kinematics better than `` stellar '' ( i.e. , photometric ) parameters , such as gini ( abraham et al .",
    "2003 ) , m20 ( lotz et al . 2004 ) , or cas ( abraham et al . 1996 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the distribution of gas is more easily disturbed than that of stars , making gas an efficient tracer of kinematic disturbances ( stil & israel 2002 , cannon et al .",

    "gas however can not be used for gas - deficient early - type galaxies .",
    "we therefore use stellar kinematics for our cluster galaxy sample that is predominantly early type and gas deficient .",
    "kinematic studies from ifs surveys have changed our view of galaxy morphology .",
    "the sauron ( de zeeuw et al . 2002 ) and atlas@xmath3 surveys ( cappellari et al .",
    "2011 ) reported that galaxies can be separated into two categories , fast and slow rotators , according to their spin parameter ( @xmath4 ) . in their classification , the majority of early - type galaxies show fast and regular rotation , which implies that they have measurable levels of ordered motion ( e.g. , emsellem et al . 2007 ; cappellari et al .",
    "2007 ; emsellem et al . 2011 ; krajnovi@xmath2 et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this however is counterintuitive to the traditional idea of a `` pressure - supported '' early - type and `` ordered - motion supported '' late - type description of galaxies , thereby questioning the origin and evolution of angular momentum in different types of galaxies .",
    "the investigation of mergers on angular momentum changes can provide clues to the origin of slow rotators .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that galaxies can lose their angular momentum via mergers and become slow rotators ( bois et al .",

    "naab et al .",
    "2014 , and references therein ) . to empirically assess the role of mergers on the evolution of angular momentum ,",
    "it is necessary to know the intrinsic distribution of angular momentum of stable disks , before a galaxy undergoes an interaction .",
    "the tully - fisher relation ( t - f , tully & fisher 1977 ) serves this purpose . the tight correlation between stellar",
    "luminosity and hi line width has been well established by many studies on disk galaxies in the local universe .",
    "furthermore , the t - f relation is found even among early - type galaxies using hi and co line observations ( williams , bureau & cappellari 2010 ; davis et al .",
    "2011 ; heijer et al .",
    "recently , cortese et al . (",
    "2014 ) found that early - type galaxies exhibit t - f relation similar to spirals , although with markedly larger scatter .",
    "these findings imply that the t - f relation is a general trend in `` regular '' rotating systems regardless of galaxy morphology ; and if dynamical interactions change the angular momentum of galaxies , they introduce scatter in the t - f relation ( kassin et al . 2007 ;",
    "covington et al . 2010 ; de rossi et al . 2012 ) .",
    "several studies from numerical simulations suggest that the direction of angular momentum can be easily changed via gas accretion from cosmic webs or galaxy mergers ( e.g. kimm et al . 2011 ; sharma , steinmetz , & bland - hawthorn 2012 ; dubois et al .",
    "the misalignment of orientation between images and stellar kinematics was first introduced in franx , illingworth & de zeeuw ( 1991 ) , and after that several ifs surveys also detected the kinematic misalignment . krajnovi@xmath2",
    "( 2011 ) reported that 10% of early - type galaxies , some of which show prominent merger features , show misaligned kinematic and morphological orientations .",

    "2012 ) , barrera - ballesteros et al .",
    "( 2015 ) compared kinematic misalignment of interacting and undisturbed galaxies , and found large misalignments among galaxies that seem to be on - going mergers . on the other hand",
    ", the misaligned galaxies in their sample do not always show merger signatures , and misalignment was more often found among galaxies that were rounder or had low angular momentum , making it difficult to conclude on the effect of mergers on kinematic anomalies .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use deeper imaging data that reveal the merger status of galaxies clearly to answer this question .    here",
    "we investigate the impact of mergers on three aspects of kinematics : angular momentum , orientation , and asymmetry . in order",
    "to do this we used deep optical images obtained with the blanco 4-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio , sheen et al .",

    "we subtracted the 180@xmath85 rotated image from the original one and normalized it using the total flux . then , the asymmetry parameter @xmath124 is measured by the summation of residuals excluding contaminated regions by other objects .",
    "the central parts of bright galaxies are saturated in our deep images because we were attempting to detect low surface brightness features ; hence , we only considered residuals in the outer regions : beyond @xmath30 to @xmath79 above the sky level .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]      repeated mergers and interactions between galaxies probably reduce the specific angular moment of a galaxy , and hence it is reasonable to expect more frequent merger - related features in slow rotators .",
    "our deep images are capable of detecting even ( reasonably important ) minor mergers and faint features in outer regions of galaxies where dynamical time scale is much longer than in galaxy center and therefore we can probe the signatures of past mergers further back .",
    "we focus on the fraction of disturbed galaxies among slow rotators .",
    "three out of 8 slow rotators appear disturbed , which is only marginally significant compared to the fast rotators ( 17 out of 55 ) .",
    "but , the statistical differences do not appear clear enough .    recently , duc et al .",
    "( 2015 ) investigated galaxy morphology using similar deep images with ours and kinematics of atlas@xmath3 sample in the field environment .",
    "of the 78 galaxies whose morphological class is not `` undetermined '' , 46 galaxies ( @xmath133 ) displayed features involved in galaxy interactions ( `` major merger '' or `` minor merger '' or `` interacting '' in their classification ) . fractions of galaxy interactions in fast and slow rotators were @xmath134 ( 38/66 ) and @xmath135 ( 8/12 ) , respectively in their study .",
    "the major difference between their and our results is that they found around 1.8 times higher fractions of galaxy interactions than us .",
    "this can be explained by the difference in a sample ; their sample includes only galaxies in the field environment .",
    "previous studies using deep images reported that galaxies with post - merger features are more frequently observed in the field ( e.g. van dokkum 2005 ) than in the cluster environment ( e.g. sheen et al .",
    "besides , the median distance of their sample is 28 mpc , which is 7 times closer than our abell 119 sample .",
    "this makes it easier to detect features of morphological disturbance .",
    "apart from that , slow rotators show only slightly higher fractions of galaxy interactions than fast rotators both in duc et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and in this work .",
    "this is perhaps because mergers may have occurred in the distant past on those slow rotators that do not show disturbed features .",
    "this is consistent with recent galaxy formation models where important mergers are rare after @xmath136 ( khim et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "as shown in section 4.1 , a single merger ( or interaction ) can either reduce or enhance the spin depending on the merger condition ; that is , both effects are possible , as also demonstrated by simulations ( bois et al .",
    "2011 ; naab et al .",
    "this makes it difficult to uniquely determine the effect of mergers on the angular momentum of a galaxy at a specific epoch .",
    "we investigated the impact of galaxy interactions on the kinematic anomalies using 63 galaxies in abell 119 based on stellar kinematics from sami .",
    "we visually selected 20 galaxies with disturbed features ( @xmath137 ) using our deep images .",
    "morphologically - disturbed galaxies in this study have faint features that generally show a slight asymmetry ( @xmath138 ) , which can only be detected in deep images .",
    "the use of `` model '' values of rotational velocities reveals a tully - fisher relation with unexpectedly small scatter even for early - type galaxies .",
    "the morphologically - disturbed galaxies , on the other hand , showed a scatter twice as large .",
    "galaxy interactions are likely the main origin of scatter in the t - f relation , capable of both reducing and enhancing the level of angular momentum , probably depending on the details of galaxy interaction .",
    "we classified slow / fast rotators using the spin parameter @xmath4 and found 8 slow rotators in our sample .",
    "approximately , @xmath139 of the slow rotators and @xmath140 of the fast rotators displayed disturbed features .",
    "the difference hints for a role of mergers on galaxy spin but is not statistically significant .",
    "galaxy interactions are one of the key mechanisms that change the orientation of spin of galaxies .",
    "likewise , kinematic misalignments are more often found among the morphologically - disturbed galaxies in our sample .",
    "kinematic misalignments are also more common among the galaxies with low angular momentum ; this is probably because the same level of interaction can have a larger impact on a galaxy with lower angular momentum .",
    "when we measure the level of kinematic perturbation , it seems necessary to account for the underlying relationship between the kinematic asymmetry and the level of rotation .",
    "we thus introduced a new parameter ( @xmath111 ) which effectively reveals the impact of galaxy interactions on kinematics and photometric morphology .",
    "a causality connection is mildly visible between morphological disturbance and kinematics , but not all the disturbed galaxies have unusual kinematics .",
    "several effects may contribute to this .",
    "first , we compared the stellar kinematics within @xmath40 with the disturbed features in the outer regions .",
    "if we can detect stellar kinematics in the same region of galaxies where the disturbed features are shown , we might find a tighter correlation between photometry and kinematics .",
    "we also need to consider the lifetime of features in kinematics and images .",
    "some aspects might be more quickly regularized than others through galaxy evolution ( hoffman et al . 2010 ; ji et al . 2014 ) , which could weaken correlations .",
    "we anticipate progress in several directions .",
    "first , it is desired to obtain and analyze the ifs and photometric data in the same extended regions of galaxies .",
    "second , we should perform ifs observations on the numerous cluster galaxies for which deep images are already available . although some advances have been made in this field by numerical simulations ,",
    "they have so far been limited to a small number of galaxies or to semi - analytic models .",
