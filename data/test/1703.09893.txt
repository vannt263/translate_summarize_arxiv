    "supported by a host of observations of supernova ( sn ) explosions , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , their remnants , and the compact objects they leave behind , current theory of stellar core collapse considers a variety of outcomes for the post - collapse evolution of the burnt - out cores of massive stars ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "plausible scenarios involve the formation of a proto - neutron star ( pns ) , from whose inner core a shock wave is launched and fails to reach the outer layers of the star but stalls inside the core .",
    "neutrino heating , hydrodynamic instabilities , and , possibly , other mechanisms such as rotation and magnetic fields act against the accretion of the surrounding shells increasing the mass of the pns .",
    "the balance between these effects may lead to a sn explosion in which the accretion flows are shut down and the pns at the centre gradually transforms into a neutron star .",
    "it is also conceivable that the asymmetric geometry of the explosion runs parallel to continuing accretion and , hence , the pns grows beyond the maximum mass supported against self - gravity and , finally , collapses to a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the latter outcome is probably inevitable if no sn occurs at all .",
    "irrespective of the failure or success of a previous sn explosion , high - energy transients are possible even after bh formation , in particular if rapid rotation allows for a long grb in the collapsar model .",
    "the first scenario ( sn explosion and ns formation ) seems likely particularly for stars in the lower range of masses ( for recent studies , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while we might encounter conditions favouring bh formation with or without sn explosion among stars with higher masses .",
    "the former studies suggest a fairly complex dependence of the final outcome on the progenitor conditions rather than , say , a clear threshold at a certain mass .",
    "we explore this complex landscape focusing on low metallicity models , some of which have been traditionally considered as precursors of collapsars @xcite .",
    "we examine in detail the post - collapse evolution of five models of core collapse based on two @xmath2 progenitors taken from stellar evolution calculations ( see sect.[sek : models ] , sect.[sek : results ] , and sect.[sek : concl ] for our models , results , and conclusions , respectively ) .",
    "we vary the angular momentum profile and the magnetic field strength in the progenitor star and perform axisymmetric simulations including special - relativistic mhd and two - moment neutrino transport .",
    "a similar study has been performed by @xcite .",
    "however , we improve on that paper in several aspects ( neutrino transport , inclusion of special relativistic mhd and the treatment of gravity ) .",
    "we performed axisymmetric simulations of the coupled evolution of the stellar gas , its magnetic fields , and the neutrinos emitted by the core solving the equations of special - relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and neutrino transport . to this end",
    ", we use the eulerian finite - volume code described in @xcite , which we previously had applied in core - collapse modelling @xcite . the most important extension w.r.t .",
    "the latter study is the inclusion of heavy - lepton neutrinos and the pair processes ( electron - positron annihilation and nucleonic bremsstrahlung ) producing them .",
    "we included the effects of gravity in the neutrino transport in the @xmath3-plus formulation of @xcite .",
    "we use the equation of state ( eos ) of @xcite with an incompressibility of @xmath4 for densities above @xmath5 , which allows for a maximum baryonic neutron - star mass of @xmath6 ( we note that all masses quoted in this article will be baryonic masses . ) at lower densities , the eos contains electrons and positrons , photons , and baryons .",
    "we simulate two stars with zero - age main - sequence masses of @xmath7 , one of which is considered as a prototype progenitor of a collapsar .",
    "the pre - collapse states of stellar models ` 35oc ` and ` 35ob ` are the results of spherical stellar - evolution computations of @xcite that include rotation and an approximation to a dynamo driven by rotation and the associated magnetic transport of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the models differ only in their mass - loss rate , whose values translate to total stellar masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 at collapse .",
    "the structure of the two cores differs considerably , particularly at mass coordinates outside @xmath10 ( fig.[fig : initprof ] ) , i.e. , in the regions whose accretion will determine the final fate of the sn shock wave and the compact remnant .",
    "the progenitor star ` 35oc ` possesses a non - convective iron core in ( quasi-)nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) of @xmath11 surrounded by a region of about @xmath12 in which convection maintains a flat entropy profile ( see fig.[fig : initprof ] ) . in model `",
    "35ob ` , the transition from the iron core to the convective layers is made up of two distinct shells , and the jumps of entropy and density at the first interface ( at @xmath13 ) are less than at the corresponding interface in model ` 35oc ` , and the next , more gradual , transition is at a rather large mass coordinate of @xmath14 .",
    "further differences can be found in the rotational profile : model ` 35ob ` possesses a smooth , monotonically increasing profile of specific angular momentum , @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "model ` 35oc ` displays a drop of @xmath15 by a factor of 5 at a mass coordinate of @xmath16 , such that the inner and outer regions of the core have a larger and smaller @xmath15 than model ` 35ob ` at the same mass coordinates , respectively .",
    "we simulated versions of the former model with its original rotational profile and either weak or very strong magnetic fields ( models ` 35oc - ro ` , ` 35oc - rw ` , and ` 35oc - rs ` , respectively ) as well as a version of the model in which we reduced the rotational rate by a factor 4 and included a weak magnetic field ( model ` 35oc - sw ` ) . to this set , we added model ` 35ob - ro ` , a simulation of core ` 35ob ` with the original rotational profile and magnetic field .",
    "we initialized models ` 35oc - ro ` and ` 35ob - ro ` using the profiles of the radial and toroidal components of the stellar - evolution model .",
    "these fields are fairly strong with maximum strengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( model ` 35oc ` ) and @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( model ` 35ob ` ) .",
    "the artificial magnetic fields included in models ` 35oc - rw ` , ` 35oc - rs ` , and ` 35oc - sw ` are defined in terms of the vector potential , @xmath21 , of @xcite @xmath22^{-1 }    \\left ( b_0 { r_0 ^ 3 r \\sin      \\theta } ,       0 ,       b_0 { r_0 ^ 3 r^2 \\cos      \\theta }    \\right).\\ ] ] we set the radius parameter @xmath23 and the normalizations such that the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field at the origin are @xmath24 or @xmath25 for all models except for ` 35oc - rs ` , for which @xmath26 . the exact value of the field strength in the former class of models is not important because the field remains dynamically insignificant in our simulations .",
    "however , we can not exclude that such weak fields grow to relevant strengths by processes ( magnetorotational instability , turbulent dynamos , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) acting at small scales below our grid resolution .",
    "the computational domain extends up to @xmath27 cm , spans latitudes in the range @xmath28 $ ] and it is covered with @xmath29 zones in spherical coordinates ( logarithmically spaced in the radial direction and uniform in the angular direction ) .",
    "the neutrino spectrum is discretized in 10 log - spaced bins .",
    "the horizontal line shows the maximum mass of a cold - non - rotating neutron star supported by our eos , and asterisks mark the instants of collapse to a bh .",

    "@xcite demonstrated that very compact cores , characterized by a high value of the radius @xmath30 enclosing a total mass @xmath31 ( usually taken to be @xmath32 ) as @xmath33 , tend to resist shock revival and yield failed sn explosions that lead to bh formation by accretion onto the pns .",
    "the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 place our cores in a marginal regime where explosions can be expected to be quite difficult to achieve . nevertheless , as the time evolution of the shock radii ( panel _ ( a ) _ of fig.[fig : globals ] ) demonstrates",
    ", all models eventually achieve shock revival , albeit driven by distinct mechanisms .",
    "the explosions are very asymmetric , thus allowing for ongoing equatorial accretion onto the pns , which , therefore , might reach the maximum mass that can be supported against gravity and then collapse to a bh . panels _ ( b ) _ and _ ( c ) _ present the time evolution of the total ( internal , kinetic , magnetic and gravitational ) energy and the mass for all the matter that is unbound , i.e. , has a positive total energy .",
    "the former quantity is a proxy of the explosion energy .",
    "we find a broad range of energies and masses .",
    "we note particularly energies in excess of @xmath36 and still growing when the simulations are ended .",
    "only model ` 35ob - ro ` shows a lower explosion energy , but we expect it to exceed @xmath37 if the model were run for a longer time . in all cases , we find ejecta masses @xmath38 , which may grow further on longer time scales .",
    "the high compactness of the cores ` 35oc ` and ` 35ob ` translates into pnss that are quite massive already at their formation and grow strongly afterwards ( panel _ ( d ) _ of fig.[fig : globals ] ) , exceeding @xmath39 after only 200 ms except for model ` 35oc - rs ` , for which the pns mass reaches a maximum of @xmath40 at @xmath41 and then decreases again . for models of core",
    "` 35oc ` , the increase slows down once the interface of the iron core has been accreted , which happens at @xmath42 .",
    "a similar behaviour was found in 2d ; e.g. , @xcite and in 3d models ; e.g. , @xcite . model ` 35oc - sw ` undergoes bh collapse after @xmath43 with a pns mass slightly below the eos limit ( the difference can be attributed to our approximate gr potential ) .",
    "we note that the decrease of the mass accretion rate ( the derivative of the curves in the figure ) is less pronounced for model ` 35ob - ro ` than for models ` 35oc ` as the former model starts at this point to accrete the still fairly dense intermediate layer outside of the comparably weak density jump at @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the pns of model ` 35ob - ro ` exceeds the maximum mass of a cold , non - rotating ns rather quickly .",
    "even though the pns mass grows to @xmath44 , it is temporarily stabilized by thermal and rotational support , until it collapses to a bh too .",
    "in addition , all of the pnss possess fairly high rotational energy and specific angular momentum ( panel _ ( e ) _ ) of the order of several @xmath45 .",
    "the highest values are found in the rapidly rotating versions of model ` 35oc ` .",
    "models ` 35oc - rw ` and ` 35oc - ro ` maintain a roughly constant level of @xmath46 after @xmath47 , whereas the decrease of the pns mass of model ` 35oc - rs ` , setting in around that time , is accompanied by a drop of its specific angular momentum .",
    "model ` 35oc - sw ` behaves similarly to the former two models and shows a flat specific angular momentum , though at a much lower level .",
    "finally , the comparably high specific angular momentum that model ` 35ob - ro ` possesses outside a mass coordinate of @xmath48 ( see fig.[fig : initprof ] ) yields a moderate rise of @xmath15 , which , does not exceed that of models ` 35oc - rw ` and ` 35oc - ro ` , though .",
    "the neutrino luminosities ( panel _ ( f ) _ of fig.[fig : globals ] ) reflect the mass accretion history with a drop corresponding to the accretion of the interface of the iron core . rapidly rotating models consistently emit less energy in neutrinos than their slowly rotating counterparts .",
    "many studies of the explosion mechanism of ccsne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) found a positive correlation between the neutrino luminosity of a core and its tendency towards explosion with shock revival setting in if a critical luminosity that depends on , among other factors , the mass accretion rate of the core , is exceeded .",
    "the similar times of explosion found in model ` 35oc - rw ` and model ` 35oc - sw ` seem to contradict this connection .",
    "an even lower luminosity can be found in models ` 35oc - rs ` and ` 35oc - ro ` , which are also the first to explode , whereas model ` 35ob - ro ` with the second lowest luminosity of all models explodes last . to resolve these apparent disagreements with theoretical expectations",
    ", we have to turn to the two - dimensional structure of the models as we shall see below in the discussion of the individual models .",
    "the explosion of model ` 35oc - sw ` is closest to the standard paradigm of neutrino - driven shock revival aided by hydrodynamic instabilities . after stagnating and receding ,",
    "the shock starts to expand once the surface of the iron core has been accreted .",
    "the process is dominated by the highly stochastic dynamics of convection and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) creating large - scale bubbles of high entropy which evolve into outflows of a degree of collimation that varies with time , but is on average less pronounced than in other models .",
    "we also note that the ejecta show , due to their origin in highly stochastic processes a strong north - south asymmetry ( see panel _ ( a ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots ] ) .",
    "downflows remain active between these bubbles , feeding the growth of the pns .",
    "consequently , the pns collapses to a bh after @xmath49 .",
    "we point out that the neutrino emission is highly aspherical and the amount of energy deposition varies strongly with time and latitude , leading to a highly variable rate of injection of mass and energy into the northern and southern outflows . by the time of bh formation",
    ", the core shows a roughly spherical shape with a radius @xmath50 ( panel _ ( a ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots-2 ] ) and a small spin parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the high compactness of the core translates the moderate rotational and magnetic energies into a high surface - averaged angular velocity in excess of @xmath52 and surface fields of several @xmath53 .",
    "prior to the onset of explosion , the shock surface and the neutrino - spheres are oblate due to the strong centrifugal support in model ` 35oc - rw ` .",
    "consequently , the gain layer at the pole is exposed to an enhanced neutrino flux .",
    "this effect locally compensates for the reduction of the total neutrino luminosity mentioned above ( cf.panel _ ( f ) _ of fig.[fig : globals ] ) . along the poles where rotational support is weakest",
    ", @xmath54 is even stronger than in .",
    "thus , though residing quite deep in the gravitational well , the polar regions of the gain layer satisfy the conditions for an explosion as soon as the iron core interface is accreted and the mass accretion rate and ram pressure at the shock decrease .",
    "we note that the latter variables are already before that point smaller than in model ` 35oc - sw ` . for this reason , the shock does not retreat as much as in that model .",
    "an explosion develops whose geometry is similar to that of model ` 35oc - sw ` ( panel _ ( b ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots ] ) .",
    "the explosion occurs while matter is still falling onto the pns at low latitudes , allowing the pns to grow . compared to model ` 35oc - sw ` , the time of shock revival and the evolution of the maximum shock radius are almost unchanged , but both their mass and energy grow slower ( panels _ ( b , c ) _ of fig.[fig : globals ] ) .",
    "the degree of collimation of the outflow , while varying with time , is higher than that of model ` 35oc - sw ` , in particular towards the end of the simulation .",
    "a rotationally stabilized quasi - toroidal structure extending at the equator to @xmath55 km ( compared to a polar radius of @xmath56 km ) surrounds the inner core ( see panel _",
    "( b ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots-2 ] ) .",
    "this equatorial torus contains a fairly large fraction of the total angular momentum , its surface rotates rapidly ( @xmath57 ) and is strongly magnetized ( @xmath58 ) .     km . ]        if rapid rotation is combined with a strong magnetic field ( model ` 35oc - rs ` ) , a bipolar explosion develops almost immediately after bounce ( fig.[fig:2dplots ] , panel _ ( c ) _ ) . along the poles , the shock wave never even stalls .",
    "the explosion does not result from the reduction of the mass accretion rate because shock expansion starts long before the surface of the iron core has fallen onto the pns , i.e. , in the phase when @xmath59 is greater than at the time of shock expansion of models ` 35oc - sw ` and ` 35oc - rw ` .",
    "later on , mass accretion , occurring mainly via equatorial downflows is weaker and is after @xmath60 even entirely quenched by the expanding ejecta .",
    "consequently , the pns mass is by the end of the simulation @xmath61 smaller than in the other two models , and we do not expect the pns to collapse to a bh for many dynamical time scales .",
    "the explosion is not caused mainly by neutrinos , whose luminosity is weaker than in any other model . instead",
    ", the ejecta are generated magneto - rotationally . by the end of the simulation",
    ", the outflows have reached velocities of @xmath62 , and the speed of the jet head is close to @xmath63 .",
    "the oblate geometry of the pns is even more pronounced than in the models discussed so far ( panel _ ( c ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots-2 ] ) .",
    "the surface is at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. , model ` 35oc - rs ` rotates slowlier and is more magnetized than model ` 35oc - rw ` .",
    "the axisymmetry of our models restricts them compared to three - dimensional models @xcite since first , they do not observe the quenching of the accretion flow by the ejecta and , second , their jets exhibit 3d instabilities absent in our models .",
    "the behaviour of model ` 35oc - ro ` ( panel _ ( d ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots ] ) lies in between those of models ` 35oc - rw ` and model ` 35oc - rs ` .",
    "shock revival occurs at @xmath66 due to neutrino heating concentrated at the poles .",
    "strong magnetic fields partially suppress lateral motions in the gain layer .",
    "consequently , fluid elements are not as likely to leave the region of maximum heating rate sideways towards the equator as in model ` 35oc - rw ` .",
    "the explosion caused by neutrino energy deposition aided by magnetic fields shares many characteristics with standard neutrino - driven explosions such as a certain degree of stochasticity that manifests itself in north - south asymmetry of the ejecta .",
    "the strong magnetic field transports angular momentum from the interior of the pns to its outer layers , which as a consequence possess an excess of rotational support and assume an oblate form ( panel _ ( d ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots-2 ] ) . at the termination of the simulation",
    ", the pns is very massive ( @xmath67 ) , but not very compact ( the polar and equatorial radii are between 16 and 40 km ) due to its fast rotation ( the effective spin parameter is @xmath68 ) , and it does not seem to be at the verge of forming a bh .",
    "its surface rotation and magnetic field are characterized by high values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    with a magnetic field too weak for a magneto - centrifugal explosion ,",
    "model ` 35ob - ro ` explodes similarly to model ` 35oc - rw ` , albeit much later ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we refer to panel _",
    "( e ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots ] showing the morphology of the ejecta at late times .",
    "the delay is caused by the high mass accretion rates and ram pressures at the shock persisting until the accretion of the interface at @xmath72 ( cf.fig.[fig:initprof ] ) .",
    "because at most locations in the core the initial density is higher than in model ` 35oc ` , the pns mass grows rapidly and reaches @xmath73 already at @xmath74 . at that point ,",
    "the pns ( at a spin parameter @xmath75 ) is rather compact and moderately oblate with radii between 16 ( poles ) and 22 km ( panel _ ( e ) _ of fig.[fig:2dplots-2 ] ) .",
    "it rotates at @xmath76 and possesses a field strength of @xmath77 .",
    "the model forms a moderately rotating bh after about 1.4 s.",
    "to assess their viability as candidates for supernova explosions and as progenitors of long grbs , we studied the collapse and the post - bounce evolution of the cores of stars of initial masses of @xmath7 with different degrees of rotation and magnetic fields in neutrino - mhd simulations .",
    "our five simulations show very distinct dynamics : ( 1 ) explosions within the standard neutrino - driven paradigm of supernova theory , but followed by collapse to a bh ; ( 2 ) rapid rotation concentrating neutrino emission along the rotational axis and generating bipolar explosion ; ( 3 ) early magneto - rotational explosions launching moderately relativistic outflows .",
    "all explosions have a very prolate morphology .",
    "the energies and masses of the ejecta differ strongly among models , with the most violent explosion , viz .",
    "one launched by the magneto - rotational mechanism , exceeding an energy of @xmath78 and a mass of @xmath79 at the end of the simulation , while the others achieve energies of the order of @xmath80 that are still growing when we had to terminate the computation .    in most cores ,",
    "accretion onto the pns goes on after the onset of explosion , thus making a later collapse to a bh quite likely , and in two models bh collapse was actually found . in such a case , we expect that the models with the most rapid rotation might produce a second energy release in which hyperaccretion onto the newly formed bh drives another generation of outflows along the rotational axis into the low - density funnel left behind by the initial outflows .",
    "@xcite found that model ` 35oc ` is very susceptible to early magneto - rotational explosions that inhibit the growth of the pns mass and make a later collapse to a bh unlikely , thus diminishing the prospects of a collapsar - type progenitor .",
    "indeed , the reduction of the rotation rate ( model ` 35oc - sw ` ) as well as a different profile of the core ( model ` 35ob - ro ` ) allow for bh formation and , thus , an evolution within the collapsar scenario .",
    "our strongly magnetized models suggest similar conclusions , but indicate a greater possibility for grbs powered by a pm central engine ( @xcite ; m11 hereafter ) .",
    "even though simulations on longer times are required to settle this issue , we already observe that the way towards the fiducial conditions assumed in m11 is more complex than sketched by the former authors . the main reasons for the discrepancy arise from two facts .",
    "first , the equatorial accretion along with bipolar mass loss , both of variable strength , are active throughout the post - bounce time here presented .",
    "consequently , the mass of the pns may change either increasing ( ` 35oc - ro ` ) or slightly decreasing ( ` 35oc - rs ` ) .",
    "it should be noted that without the restriction of axisymmetry , the dynamics of the accretion flows feeding the pns might be considerably more complex and bh formation might be less likely .",
    "second , the pns shape of potential pms is very oblate ( i.e. , not spherical ) .",
    "some of the key parameters in the pm model are the period ( @xmath81 ) , the radius and the mass of the pns at the moment of _ birth _ of the pm ( which can be taken @xmath82 post bounce when the contraction of the pns practically ceases in the m11 model ) , as well as the poloidal component of the magnetic field on the surface of the pns .",
    "the time evolution of all of them during the first 2s post bounce does not follow the simple paths sketched in m11 .",
    "we estimate for models ` 35oc - ro ` and ` 35oc - rs ` values @xmath83 extrapolating the evolution of the pns after 50ms post bounce .",
    "these values are smaller than the ones computed for stable and isolated neutron stars ( @xmath84 ) of smaller masses than the pnss we consider here ( e.g. , @xcite make their estimates for a mass of @xmath85 ) .",
    "likewise , m11 assume that the magnetic field energy is a fraction @xmath86 of the gravitational energy of the pns .",
    "our potential pm models show @xmath87",
    ". however , the poloidal field at the pns surface is smaller than assumed in m11 . for model `",
    "35oc - rs ` , @xmath88 , while for model ` 35oc - ro ` @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we note that potential pm models display an early phase of magnetic field amplification where @xmath90 quickly ( @xmath91sec ) settles to a value @xmath92 .",
    "models evolving into collapsars need @xmath93sec to arrive to similar values of @xmath90 , and once at that level , they display variations in strength by factors @xmath94 within timescales of 100ms .",
    "we close with a few comments on the shortcomings and uncertainties of our current study .",
    "while general - relativistic versions of our models might produce slightly different results , even shift the border between sn explosion and bh collapse somewhat , we think that the pseudo - relativistic potential we chose is a rather accurate approximation and affects only the criteria for , but not the existence of the scenarios summarized above . in this context",
    ", we mention in particular that our approach does not include energy losses due to gravitational waves .",
    "however , the rotational frequencies required for this effect to play a role exceed those of our models , and hence we deem its neglect insignificant . our treatment of neutrino - matter interactions can be improved by using more recent opacity models , but tentatively expect that the uncertainty coming from that source is also more in the realm of minor quantitative shifts in the parameter space rather than a complete change of our conclusions .",
    "the most important limitation is axisymmetry , as three - dimensional effects might considerably modify the topology of the flows @xcite . while very interesting , three - dimensional long - term simulations of several models are still very challenging computationally and , thus , a topic for future research .",
