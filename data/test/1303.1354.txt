    "stochastic geometry has recently been used for the analysis and performance evaluation of wireless  ( ad hoc as well as cellular ) networks ; in this approach , one models node locations as a spatial point process , e.g. , homogeneous poisson point processes , and one computes various network statistics , e.g. , interference , successful transmission probability , coverage  ( or , outage ) probability etc . as spatial averages .",
    "this often leads to tractable performance metrics that are amenable to parametric optimization with respect to network parameters ( node density , protocol parameters , etc . ) .",
    "more precisely , this approach yields spatial averages of the performance metrics for given network parameters ; then the parameters can be chosen to optimize performance .",
    "this approach takes a macroscopic view of the network with the underlying assumption that all nodes in the network have identical statistical characteristics .    in practice , due to randomness and heterogeneity in networks",
    ", nodes need to adapt to local spatial and temporal conditions  ( e.g. , channel conditions and topology ) to reach optimum network wide performance .",
    "for example , nodes in wireless lans adjust their window sizes based on acknowledgment feedback ; in cellular networks nodes are scheduled based on channel conditions and adapt their transmit powers based on the measured sinrs , which in turn depend on the transmit powers set by other nodes . in all such scenarios ,",
    "distributed adaptive algorithms are used to reach a desired network wide operating point e.g. that maximizing some utility . while the behavior of such distributed optimization protocols is often well understood on a given topology , there are usually no analytical characterizations of the statistical properties of the optimal state in large random and heterogeneous networks .",
    "the main aim of this work is to use stochastic geometry to study spatial adaptations of medium access control in aloha that aim at optimizing certain utilities . while we identify a utility for which stochastic geometry can be used to compute the spatial distribution of map and the expected utility , we are far from being able to do so for all types of utilities within the @xmath0-fair class and we discuss the difficulties to be faced .",
    "let us start with a review of the state of the art on aloha .",
    "wireless spectrum is well known to be a precious and scarce shared resource .",
    "medium access control  ( mac ) algorithms are employed to coordinate access to the shared wireless medium .",
    "an efficient mac protocol should ensure high system throughput , and should also distribute the available bandwidth fairly among the competing nodes .",
    "the simplest of the mac protocols , aloha and slotted aloha , with a `` random access '' spirit , were introduced by abramson  @xcite and roberts  @xcite respectively . in these protocols ,",
    "only one node could successfully transmit at a time .",
    "reference  @xcite modeled node locations as spatial point processes , and also modeled channel fadings , interferences and sinr based reception .",
    "this allowed for spatial reuse and multiple simultaneous successful transmissions depending on sinr levels at the corresponding receivers .",
    "all the above protocols prescribe identical attempt probabilities for all the nodes .",
    "reference  @xcite further proposed opportunistic aloha in which nodes transmission attempts are modulated by their channel conditions .    among the initial attempts of map adaptation in aloha , reference",
    "@xcite analyzed protocol model and proposed stochastic approximation based strategies that were based on receiver feedback and were aimed at stabilizing the network .",
    "references  @xcite also optimized nodes attempt probabilities  ( or thresholds ) in order to maximize the spatial density of successful transmissions .",
    "reference  @xcite analyzed both plain and opportunistic aloha in a network where all the nodes communicate to one access point .",
    "they assumed statistically identical rayleigh faded channels with no dependence on geometry  ( i.e. , no path loss components ) .",
    "they demonstrated a paradoxical behavior where plain aloha yields better aggregate throughput than the opportunistic one .",
    "reference  @xcite also studied optimal random access with sinr based reception .",
    "however , they considered constant channel gains .",
    "they developed a centralized algorithm that maximizes the network throughput , and also an algorithm that leads to max - min fair operation .",
    "reference  @xcite modeled network as an undirected graph and studied aloha under the protocol model .",
    "they designed distributed algorithms that are either proportional fair or max - min fair .",
    "reference  @xcite built upon the model of  @xcite , and formulated the channel access problem as a non - cooperative game among users .",
    "they considered throughput and delay as performance metrics and proposed pricing schemes that induce socially optimum behavior at equilibrium .",
    "however , they set time average quantities  ( e.g. , throughput , delay ) as utilities  ( or costs ) , and concentrated on symmetric nash equilibria .",
    "consequently , in their analysis , dependence on local conditions vanishes .    in none of the above aloha models ,",
    "nodes account for both wireless channel randomness and local topology for making their random access decisions , as we do in the present paper .",
    "there is a vast literature on the modeling of csma by stochastic geometry which will not be reviewed in detail here .",
    "the very nature of this mac protocol is adaptive as each node senses the network and acts in order to ensure that certain exclusion rules are satisfied , namely that neighboring nodes do not access the channel simultaneously .",
    "however , csma as such is designed to guarantee a reasonable scheduling , not to optimize any utility of the throughput .",
    "the closest reference to our work is probably  @xcite where the authors study an adaptation of the exclusion range and of the transmit power of a csma node to the location of the closest interferer .",
    "this adaptation aims at maximizing the mean number of nodes transmitting per unit time and space  ( while respecting the above exclusion rules ) .",
    "this mean number is however only a surrogate of the rate . in addition , the adaptation is only w.r.t . to the location of the nearest interferer .",
    "we study spatial adaptation of aloha in ad hoc networks .",
    "the network setting is described in section  [ sec : network - model ] .",
    "we consider quasi - static networks in which mobiles learn the topology , and incorporate this information in their medium access probability  ( map ) selection .",
    "we consider the cases where nodes are benevolent and cooperate in a distributed way to maximize the global network throughput or to reach either a proportional fair or max - min fair sharing of the network resources .",
    "we analyze the case where nodes account only for their closest interferers , for all nodes in a given ball around them , or even all nodes in the network .",
    "section  [ sec : aggr - interf ] is focused on the distributed algorithms that maximize the aggregate throughput or lead to max - min fairness in such networks . in the proportional fair case ,",
    "we show that nodes can compute the optimal maps as solutions to certain fixed point equations . in the maximum throughput case",
    ", the optimal maps are obtained through a gibbs sampling based algorithm . in the max min case ,",
    "the optimal maps are obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem .",
    "section  [ ss : stocg ] contains the stochastic geometry results .",
    "the model features nodes forming a realization of a homogeneous poisson point process in the euclidean plane .",
    "we compute the map distribution in such a network in the proportional fair case using shot noise field theory . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this distribution is the first example of successful combination of stochastic geometry and adaptive protocol design aimed at optimizing ceratin utility function within this aloha setting .",
    "we also show that the mean value of the logarithm of the throughput obtained by a typical node can be derived from this distribution . finally , we discuss the difficulties to be faced in order to extend the result to other types of utilities .",
    "the numerical results are gathered in section  [ ss : numerics ] .",
    "the aim of this section is two - fold : 1 ) check the analytical results against simulation and 2 ) quantify the gains brought by adaption within this setting .",
    "we model the ad - hoc wireless network as a set of transmitters and their corresponding receivers , all located in the euclidean plane .",
    "this is often referred to as `` bipole model ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  16 ) .",
    "there are @xmath1 transmitter - receiver pairs communicating over a shared channel .",
    "the transmitters follow the slotted version of the aloha medium access control  ( mac ) protocol  ( see figure  [ fig : bipole - model ] ) .",
    "a transmitter , in each transmission attempt , sends one packet which occupies one slot .",
    "each transmitter uses unit transmission power .",
    "we assume that each node has an infinite backlog of packets to transmit to its receiver .",
    "the euclidean distance between transmitter @xmath2 and receiver @xmath3 is @xmath4 , and the path - loss exponent is @xmath0  ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we also assume rayleigh faded channels with @xmath6 being the random fading between transmitter @xmath2 and receiver @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the random variables @xmath7 are independent and identically distributed with mean @xmath8 . thus all @xmath6s have cumulative distribution function  ( cdf ) @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "all the receivers are also subjected to white gaussian thermal noise with variance @xmath11 , which is also constant across slots .",
    "we assume that a receiver successfully receives the packet of the corresponding transmitter if the received sinr exceeds a threshold @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the indicator variable indicating whether transmitter @xmath3 transmits in a slot , and @xmath14 be @xmath3 s medium access probability .",
    "thus @xmath15 when node @xmath3 transmits , the received sinr at the corresponding receiver is @xmath16 then the probability of successful reception @xmath17 can be calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath18 thus @xmath19 where @xmath20 further simplifying , @xmath21 then , the rate or throughput of transmitter @xmath3 is given by @xmath22 .",
    "the thermal noise appears merely as a constant multiplicative factor in the expression for the successful transmission probability  ( see  ) .",
    "moreover , in interference limited networks , the impact of thermal noise is negligible as compared to interference .",
    "we focus on such networks , and thus we ignore the thermal noise factor throughout .",
    "in this section , we analyze adaptations of spatial aloha that maximize aggregate throughput or achieve proportional fairness or max - min fairness .      the throughput maximizing medium access probabilities solve the following optimization problem .",
    "we first argue that the optimum in the above optimization problem is attained at one of the vertices of the hypercube formed by the constraint set . to see this ,",
    "suppose @xmath24^{\\mathcal{n}}$ ] is an optimal solution , and @xmath25 for some @xmath26 . clearly , @xmath27",
    "since the partial derivative is independent of @xmath14 , @xmath14 can be set to either @xmath28 or @xmath29 without reducing the value of the objective function .",
    "this proves our claim . in the following we focus only on such extreme solutions .",
    "then the above problem is equivalent to finding an @xmath30 such that @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 is an optimal solution .",
    "thus we are interested in @xmath33    [ [ an - iterative - solution ] ] an iterative solution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we can pose this problem as a strategic form game with the users as players  @xcite . for each player",
    "its action @xmath34 lies in @xmath35 , and the utility function @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 this is a potential game with the above objective function as the potential function  @xcite .",
    "thus the best response dynamics converges to a nash equilibrium .",
    "this algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion if each node @xmath3 knows @xmath38 for all @xmath2 , and also @xmath39 and @xmath40 for all @xmath41 after each iteration . however",
    ", a nash equilibrium can be a suboptimal solution to the above optimization problem . to alleviate this problem",
    ", we propose a gibbs sampler based distributed algorithm , wherein each node @xmath3 chooses action @xmath29 with probability @xmath42 the parameter @xmath43 is called the temperature .",
    "the gibbs sampler dynamics converges to a steady state which is the gibbs distribution associated with the aggregate throughput and the temperature @xmath43  @xcite . in other words",
    ", we are led to the following distribution on the action profiles : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a normalizing constant .",
    "when @xmath43 goes to @xmath28 in an appropriate way  ( i.e. , as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the time ) , the distribution @xmath48 converges to a dirac mass at the action profile @xmath49 with maximum aggregate utility if it is unique .",
    "notice that the aggregate utility @xmath50 equals the aggregate throughput .",
    "thus the action profile @xmath49 is a solution to the original throughput optimization problem .",
    "the first two terms in the utility function @xmath51 can be seen as `` selfish '' part of user @xmath3 , whereas the last summation term is `` altruistic '' part .",
    "the user makes a decision based on whether the `` selfish '' part dominates or viceversa .    in a quasi - static network where topology continuously changes ,",
    "although at a slower time scale , different sets of nodes are likely to be scheduled to transmit under different topologies .",
    "thus , in terms of long term performance , maximum throughput medium access is not grossly unfair .",
    "the proportional fair medium access problem can be formulated as follows .",
    "@xmath52 the objective function can be rewritten as @xmath53 we thus have a convex separable optimization problem .",
    "the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to @xmath14 is @xmath54 which is continuous and decreasing in @xmath14 over @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "we conclude that at optimality , for each @xmath56 , @xmath57 observe that user @xmath3 s optimal attempt probability is independent of the attempt probabilities of other users . in particular , if @xmath58 , user @xmath3 can perform iterations @xmath59 autonomously .",
    "furthermore , @xmath60 clearly , @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 is a contraction .",
    "thus the fixed point iterations converge to the optimal @xmath14 starting from any @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "the characterization of the optimal attempt probabilities reflects the altruistic behavior of users .",
    "more precisely , user @xmath3 s attempt probability is a function of @xmath64 which are measures of @xmath3 s interference to all other users .",
    "in particular , if @xmath65 , i.e. , if @xmath3 s transmission does not cause significant interference to the other users , then @xmath3 transmits in all the slots . unlike the throughput maximization problem",
    ", there is no `` selfish '' component in the decision making rule .    as the target sinr @xmath66 , @xmath67 for all @xmath68 , and the proportional fair attempt probabilities satisfy @xmath69 for all @xmath26 .",
    "this yields @xmath70 for all @xmath26 .",
    "this is expected , because in the limiting case a transmission can succeed if and only if there is no other concurrent transmission .",
    "this is hence aloha without spatial reuse , and it is well known that in this case , the optimal access probability is @xmath71 asymptotically  @xcite .",
    "our analysis in this section follows  @xcite .",
    "the max - min fair medium access problem can be formulated as @xmath72 where constraint functions are defined for all @xmath73^{\\mathcal{n}}$ ] .",
    "the following is an equivalent convex optimization problem  ( see  @xcite for details ) : @xmath74    the lagrange function of this problem is given by  @xcite @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the lagrange multipliers .",
    "minimization of the lagrange function  ( which is concave in @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) gives @xmath79 wang and kar  @xcite suggest that the lagrange multipliers be updated using the gradient projection method . more precisely , for all @xmath26 , @xmath80^+ , \\label{eqn : aggr - interf - lambda - update}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the step size at the @xmath82th iteration .",
    "further more ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) implies that a solution arbitrary close to an optimal solution can be reached via appropriate choice of step sizes . however , all the users need to exchange variables in order to perform updates .    finally , the _ directed link graph _ corresponding to our network is a directed graph in which each vertex stands for a user  ( i.e. , a transmitter - receiver pair ) in the network .",
    "there is an edge from vertex @xmath3 to vertex @xmath2 in the directed link graph if transmission of user @xmath3 affects the success of transmission of user @xmath2 .",
    "two vertices @xmath3 and @xmath2 are said to be connected if either of the following two conditions hold :    1 .",

    "* corollary  1 ) implies that the above optimization also obtains the lexicographic max - min fair medium access probabilities that yield identical rates for all the users .",
    "note that a user needs to know the entire topology , and in a few cases , also needs to communicate with all the nodes to implement the adaptation rules developed in sections  [ sec : aggr - interf - max - thput]-[sec : aggr - interf - max - min - fair ] . in this section , we carry out analysis under the simplifying assumption that the aggregate interference at a receiver is dominated by the transmission from the closest interferer .",

    "the second term can be rewritten as  ( see  ) @xmath188.\\ ] ] under the law @xmath151 , the points @xmath189 of @xmath132 form a homogeneous poisson point process of intensity @xmath124 .",
    "however , the marks @xmath190 do not have the law identified in the last section .",
    "in fact , the mark @xmath134 of a point @xmath191 satisfies the following modified fixed point equation : @xmath192 with the convention that @xmath193 if there is no solution in @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "we can use the same argument as above to conclude that @xmath194 iff @xmath195    conditioned on there being two nodes at @xmath28 and @xmath148 , the other points form a homogeneous poisson point process of intensity @xmath124 .",
    "this allows one to prove the following .",
    "[ thm : map - typical - receiver ] under the above poisson assumptions , given that there is a node at 0 and a node at @xmath196 , the attempt probability of the node at @xmath148 has the distribution @xmath197 with @xmath198 and @xmath140 .",
    "due to the circular symmetry , the first integral in the expression of @xmath199 depends on @xmath148 only through @xmath200 .",
    "thus the density of @xmath201 also depends on @xmath200 only , and it will be denoted by @xmath202 when @xmath203 .",
    "the density of @xmath187 identified in the last subsection will be denoted by @xmath186 .",
    "the main result of this section is :    [ thm : mean - utility ] under the above poisson assumptions , in the proportional fair case , the mean utility of a typical node is @xmath204    see appendix  [ proof : thm - mean - utility ] .",
    "a preliminary concern when trying to use euclidean stochastic geometry of the infinite plane in the maximum throughput and max - min fairness cases is that it is not clear whether the associated infinite dimensional optimization problems make sense in the first place . in the proportional fair case",
    ", each node computes its optimizing map in one step as the solution of a fixed point equation that is almost surely well defined  ( in terms of a shot noise ) even in the infinite poisson population case .",
    "unfortunately , this does not extend to the other two cases .",
    "this does not mean that there is no hope at all .",
    "consider for instance the maximum throughput case accounting only for the closest interferer , and further simplify it by measuring interference at the transmitter rather than at the receiver . in other words , consider the same optimization problem as in section  [ sec : close - interf - max - thput ] but with @xmath88 being the closest transmitter to transmitter @xmath3  ( rather than to receiver @xmath3 ) .",
    "then , in the poisson case , the infinite dimensional optimization problem can be shown to reduce to a _",
    "countable collection of finite optimization problems_. this follows from the fact that there are no infinite `` descending chains '' in a homogeneous poisson point process  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  2 )  ( a _ descending chain _ is a sequence of nodes @xmath205 such that @xmath206 for all @xmath82 ) . as a result",
    ", the poisson point process can be decomposed into a countable collection of finite `` descending trees '' , where each path from the leaves to the root is a descending chain .",
    "the associated optimization is hence well defined and the problem can be reduced to evaluating the solution of the optimization problem of section  [ sec : close - interf - max - thput ] on the typical descending tree .",
    "hence , there is hope to progress on this and on related cases .",
    "this will however not be pursued here and is left for future research .",
    "in this section , we study the proposed adaptive spatial aloha schemes quantitatively . we compute various metrics formulated through the stochastic geometry based analysis , and we also perform simulation .",
    "the simulation not only validates the analytical model , but also illustrates the performance of schemes for which we do not have an analytical characterization .",
    "we used maple and matlab to evaluate the integrals of section [ ss : stocg ] .",
    "the infinite integral that shows up in the expression of the laplace transform ( [ eq : lapl ] ) is handled without truncation by maple and matlab .",
    "the singularity at @xmath207 in the contour integrals ( [ eq : parsev ] ) leveraging parseval s theorem is a false singularity and it is also handled without further work by either maple or matlab .",
    "the matlab code is particularly efficient and is used throughout the analytical evaluations described below .",
    "we consider a two dimensional square plane with side length @xmath208 , and @xmath1 nodes placed independently over the plane according to the uniform distribution ; this corresponds to @xmath209 in the stochastic geometry model .",
    ", the poisson random variable with mean @xmath210 is highly concentrated around its mean .",
    "thus we can use @xmath210 nodes for all the realizations in our simulation . ]",
    "each node has its receiver randomly located on the unit circle around it , again as per the uniform distribution .",
    "thus @xmath211 for all @xmath3 .",
    "we set @xmath181 and @xmath212 . to nullify the edge effect , we take into account only the nodes falling in the @xmath213 square around the center while computing various metrics . while all other parameters remain , we vary @xmath208 and @xmath1 for different simulations . for each parameter",
    "set we calculate the average of the performance metric of interest over @xmath214 independent network realizations .",
    "we validate the analytical expression against the simulation for the case of proportional fair medium access . for illustration , we plot the cumulative distribution function  ( c.d.f . ) of the map in figure  [ fig : map - cdf - analysis ] . here",
    "we set @xmath215 and consider two values of @xmath1 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 , which correspond to @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively .",
    "the plots show that the stochastic geometry based formula  ( see theorem  [ thm : map - distribution ] ) quite accurately predicts the nodes behavior in simulation .",
    "we also study the distributions @xmath220  ( also referred to as @xmath202 for @xmath203 ) defined in theorem  [ thm : map - typical - receiver ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : map - cdf - receiver ] shows their plots for @xmath219 and two values of @xmath200 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "again the plots based on the analytical expression and those based on simulation closely match .",
    "clearly , under @xmath151 , nodes closer to the origin are more likely to be inactive .    , the map distribution of a node at distance @xmath223 from origin , under @xmath151.,width=288,height=240 ]      in this section we illustrate the performance of various adaptive schemes and their benefit over plain aloha .",
    "we compute the performance metrics via simulation and also through analytical expressions whenever the latter are available . in such cases the analytical results and the simulation",
    "validate each other .",
    "first we set @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "we consider the maximum throughput medium access , however , only accounting for the closest interferers . in figure",
    "[ fig : gibbs - closei ] , we show steady state behavior of our gibbs sampling based algorithms ; we have set the temperature @xmath226 . as expected , the improved maximum throughput medium access  ( see the discussion at the end of section  [ sec : close - interf - max - thput ] ) insures a better exclusion behavior . under this scheme ,",
    "a lesser number of nodes transmit , and neighboring nodes are unlikely to transmit simultaneously .",
    "so , this is expected to deliver better aggregate throughput .",
    "now we keep @xmath208 fixed at @xmath227 , but vary @xmath1 from @xmath228 to @xmath229 ; this corresponds to varying @xmath124 from @xmath230 to @xmath231 in the analytical expressions .",
    "we evaluate the aggregate throughputs of various aloha schemes including plain aloha .",
    "the average throughputs are plotted in figure  [ fig : throughput ] . _",
    "although in some of the schemes we derive the attempt probabilities only considering the closest interferers , we always take into account the aggregate interference while calculating the throughput_. when the number of nodes is small , both the throughput maximizing medium access and plain aloha have identical performance ; both prescribe attempt probabilities close to one for all the nodes .",
    "when the number of nodes increases beyond @xmath232 , the throughput maximizing medium access significantly underestimates the interference , and thus its performance deteriorates . on the other hand ,",
    "the aggregate interference based proportional fair scheme significantly outperforms plain aloha in terms of aggregate throughput also .",
    "this benefit is sustained even as the number of nodes increases .",
    "we also notice that the improved version of maximum throughput medium access  ( see the discussion at the end of section  [ sec : close - interf - max - thput ] ) yields best performance among all the schemes , and its performance does not deteriorate until a much higher number of nodes .        in figure",
    "[ fig : log - throughput ] , we plot the logarithms of the aggregate throughputs corresponding to the two proportional fair medium access schemes .",
    "the figure illustrates that as the number of nodes increases , the performance of the closest interferer based medium access worsens in comparison to the performance of the aggregate interference based scheme - this is not visible merely looking at the corresponding aggregate throughputs  ( see figure  [ fig : throughput ] ) ) .        in figure",
    "[ fig : map - cdf ] , we plot the c.d.f . of the map for the proportional fair case .",
    "our objective is to compare the case when nodes account for the aggregate interference with when they account for the closest interferer only .",
    "we set @xmath215 and plot map distributions corresponding to two values of @xmath1 , @xmath233 and @xmath234  ( corresponding to @xmath219 and @xmath218 respectively ) .",
    "as expected , the nodes attempt more aggressively when they account for the closest interferer only . while there is a favored probability interval in the aggregate interference case ,",
    "there are more than one such intervals in the closest interferer case .",
    "also , in the latter case , about @xmath235 of nodes attempt in almost all slots , irrespective of @xmath1 , the total number of nodes .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the probability that a node is not the closest interferer to any other node is not sensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown the feasibility of the performance analysis of distributed adaptive protocols that aim at maximizing some global utility in a large random network using stochastic geometry .",
    "more precisely , the most natural distributed adaptation of the medium access probability of aloha that aims at proportional fairness optimization was shown to have a tractable optimal map distribution .",
    "this distribution is obtained from the law of a certain shot noise field that describes the interference created by a typical node to all receivers but his . in the poisson case ,",
    "the distribution of the optimal map is obtained as a non - singular contour integral which is amenable to an efficient evaluation using classical numerical tools .",
    "the network performance at optimum can in turn be deduced from the latter using campbell s formula .",
    "this approach is shown to provide an analytic way of quantifying the gains brought by this proportionally fair adaptive version of aloha compared to plain aloha .",
    "this line of thoughts opens several research directions .",
    "the first one is the extension to other types of fairness , still in the framework of aloha .",
    "we indicate that this is possible at least under certain simplifications of the interference model .",
    "the second and broader question is whether this approach can be extended to mac protocols other than aloha .",
    "an example would be an adaptation of the exclusion radius of csma / ca to the full environment of a node aiming at maximizing some utility of the throughput .",
    "a third general question concerns the evaluation of the `` price of decentralization '' .",
    "when the discussed protocols are suboptimal because of their greedy / distributed nature , is it possible to use stochastic geometry to evaluate the typical discrepancy between the performance of the distributed scheme and the optimal centralized one ?",
