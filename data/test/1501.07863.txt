    "one of the most celebrated successes of string theory is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this generates a powerful duality between asymptotically ads gravitational theories and conformal field theories on the ads boundary , which is the simplest and best - studied example of the more general notion of a ` gauge - gravity duality ' . as a strong - weak coupling duality",
    ", the correspondence allows for the translation of non - perturbative field theory calculations into more tractable , perturbative calculations in gravity and vice - versa .",
    "this has enabled the exploration of previously inaccessible regimes of theoretical physics . indeed , there are many examples of strongly coupled systems in condensed matter physics and it is hoped that gauge - gravity duality may allow for a better understanding of these .",
    "significant progress has already been made in this direction , leading to the development of the ads / cmt correspondence ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "further recent progress has been to extend the correspondence to spacetimes which are not asymptotically - ads but rather exhibit hyperscaling violating and lifshitz ( hvlif ) behaviour @xcite , thus extending the dictionary between gravity and condensed matter systems living on the boundary .    the central idea in gauge / gravity duality is that each state in the bulk has a corresponding state in the dual field theory .",
    "in particular , black objects are dual to thermal ensembles in the field theory with the same thermodynamic properties ( temperature , entropy , chemical potential , etc . ) as the bulk spacetime  @xcite .    a natural starting point for the correspondence",
    "is to look at charged ( reissner - nordstrm or ` rn ' ) extremal black holes and black branes in ads @xcite .",
    "however , like their asymptotically flat ` cousins ' they have a large non - zero entropy at zero temperature , thus violating the third law of thermodynamics , which states in its strictest version that the entropy of a system should vanish in the zero temperature limit @xcite .",
    "while a non - vanishing entropy for certain classes of extremal black holes is consistent with microstate counting for the corresponding d - brane configuration in string theory @xcite , this still begs the question of whether one can find other gravitational systems which have a zero entropy or entropy density at zero temperature .",
    "apart from being an interesting question about gravity , such systems are relevant for possible dualities between gravity and condensed matter systems .",
    "we remark that although ` nernst law ' is in the following used synonymously with ` third law of thermodynamics ' , nernst s original formulation only requires that the difference in entropy between two equilibrium states related through a change in external parameters goes to zero at zero temperature .",
    "this formulation is equivalent to the ` process version ' of the third law , which states that zero temperature can not be reached by any physical process in a finite number of steps .",
    "a process version of the third law of black hole mechanics was already established in @xcite .",
    "however , the nernst version or , equivalently , the process version of the third law does not imply by itself the slightly stronger version of the third law , due to planck , which states that the entropy itself goes to zero at zero temperature .",
    "this stricter version corresponds to systems with a unique ground state , and thus is the generic situation in condensed matter , although there is an extended debate about possible exceptions in specific systems , see for example @xcite .",
    "in the following we will be concerned with the explicit construction of families of gravitational solutions which have zero entropy ( or entropy density ) in the extremal limit . following conventions in the literature",
    ", we will refer to the third law in its stricter , planckian , version as the nernst law .",
    "extremal brane solutions with vanishing entropy density at zero temperature have recently been studied for a variety of bulk theories @xcite and could have important applications in extending the dictionary between condensed matter and gravity .",
    "they have been dubbed ` nernst branes ' in @xcite , and it is believed that the corresponding non - extremal solutions exist and satisfy the nernst law , that is , these non - extremal solutions have a finite entropy which goes to zero when the temperature goes to zero while external parameters are kept fixed . finding such non - extremal solutions",
    "is important , since extremal nernst branes are not completely regular solutions .",
    "while all curvature invariants remain finite at the horizon , tidal forces become infinite and scalar fields take infinite values , which suggests a breakdown of the underlying effective field theory @xcite . a first step in addressing this issue",
    "is to find non - extremal solutions , which can then be studied in the near extremal limit . in this context",
    "it is clearly desirable to have completely explicit , analytical solutions .",
    "however most results in the literature have to rely on a mixture of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "of course tidal forces may still get very large at the horizon when one approaches the extremal limit @xcite , but analytical solutions will enable one to identify the region in parameter space where the solution can be trusted and possibly be mapped to condensed matter systems .",
    "the second step in controlling the near horizon low temperature behaviour is to embed the theory under consideration into a uv - complete theory , for which string theory and its non - perturbative extension m - theory are arguably the best candidates . in the low - energy limit",
    "the relevant stringy gravitational backgrounds can be described in terms of supergravity .",
    "we will be working in a set - up which can be described by @xmath13 @xmath0 gauged supergravity with an arbitrary number of vector multiplets .",
    "theories with @xmath13 supersymmetry are natural generalisations of the einstein - maxwell - scalar theories underlying dilatonic black hole and black brane solutions which have been studied extensively as potential duals of strongly coupled electron systems @xcite .",
    "they have the advantage that one can often find exact , analytical answers , despite the fact that the couplings are not fixed by the matter content ( as is the case for @xmath14 supersymmetry ) , but depend on arbitrary functions of the scalar fields , which are subject to quantum and stringy corrections .",
    "while we do not discuss the string theory or m - theory embedding explicitly , note that such theories arise through heterotic flux compactifications on @xmath15 and type - ii flux compactifications on calabi - yau three - folds .",
    "we will not need to choose a specific model , and only assume that the vector multiplet couplings take the most general form that arises when working to leading order in the regge parameter @xmath16 , and within the validity of string perturbation theory .",
    "in other words , we only assume that the prepotential , which encodes the vector multiplet couplings , is of the so - called very special type reviewed below .",
    "by working in a gauged supergravity theory obtainable by flux compactification from string theory we will have the option to further address the issues related to singularities in the extremal limit at a later stage .",
    "for bps black holes with vanishing entropy it is known that the inclusion of stringy higher curvature corrections in supergravity @xcite leads to regular solutions with finite entropy @xcite , and the entropy function formalism demonstrates that this mechanism is robust and does not depend on supersymmetry and details of the higher curvature corrections @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a further discussion of the possible implications of quantum and string corrections to the zero temperature behaviour and the ` fate ' of the nernst law .    within the framework of four - dimensional @xmath13 @xmath0 gauged supergravity coupled to vector multiplets , extremal nernst branes",
    "have previously been constructed in @xcite using a first - order rewriting of the equations of motion , and by considering a specific model : the so - called stu - model .",
    "however a similar rewriting for their non - extremal counterparts has so far proven elusive , and the only known examples  @xcite have been constructed by deforming the metric of the corresponding five - dimensional extremal solution @xcite and imposing suitable consistency conditions . in this paper we are able to provide a systematic construction of non - extremal nernst branes by directly solving the second - order equations of motion . moreover",
    ", our results will not only apply to a particular model , but to all models where the prepotential is of the very special type .",
    "this gain in generality and systematics should help to expand the ads / cmt dictionary considerably in the future .",
    "we now present a brief overview of the results in this paper .",
    "we start with a theory of @xmath17 @xmath13 vector multiplets coupled to @xmath0 gauged supergravity , with prepotential @xmath18 where @xmath19 is homogeneous of degree three .",
    "if @xmath19 is a homogeneous _ polynomial _ of degree three ( which is not required for our methods to apply ) , then the corresponding theory can be obtained by dimensional reduction from five dimensions . moreover ,",
    "such prepotentials capture perturbative string effects to leading order in @xmath16 if the model can be embedded into heterotic or type - ii string theory .",
    "in this case the supergravity lift to five dimensions becomes a lift from type - ii string theory to m - theory .    within these models",
    "we restrict ourselves to static black brane solutions . apart from this",
    "we will impose that the scalar fields take purely imaginary values , as for such ` axion - free ' field configurations there is a systematic simplification of the equations of motion .",
    "since we impose stationarity in four dimensions , we can perform a time - like dimensional reduction to obtain an effective three - dimensional euclidean theory .",
    "the degrees of freedom in three dimensions can then be repackaged using the real formulation of special geometry developed in @xcite , which has been used to construct solutions to both gauged @xcite and ungauged @xcite theories of supergravity coupled to vector multiplets .",
    "since our ability to obtain explicit non - extremal solutions depends on using a specific formalism , let us briefly summarize the underlying principles without going into technical details .",
    "* instead of using the physical four - dimensional scalar fields @xmath20 , @xmath21 , we work on the ` big moduli space ' parametrized by scalar fields @xmath22 ,",
    "the additional ( complex ) degree of freedom is compensated for by a local @xmath24 gauge symmetry .",
    "working on the big moduli space has the advantage that the number of scalar fields and gauge fields matches .",
    "* we use the real formulation of special khler geometry , which replaces the complex scalars @xmath22 by real scalars @xmath25 , @xmath26 and which replaces the holomorphic prepotential @xmath27 by a real hesse potential @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to a simpler , and fully covariant , behaviour of all relevant quantities under electric - magnetic duality . * upon dimensional reduction , the kaluza - klein scalar @xmath29 is absorbed into the real scalars @xmath25 , which results in the ` radial ' direction of the big moduli space becoming a physical ( rather than gauge ) degree of freedom .",
    "+ we postpone fixing the remaining @xmath30 gauge symmetry to preserve electric - magnetic duality .",
    "the resulting three - dimensional theory depends on @xmath31 real scalars @xmath32 , subject to one local gauge symmetry , where @xmath33 are dual to the four - dimensional gauge fields and @xmath34 is dual to the kaluza - klein vector . while @xmath35 are vectors under electric - magnetic duality , @xmath34 is a scalar .",
    "* we impose an ansatz which corresponds , from the four - dimensional point of view , to a static solution with purely imaginary scalar fields .",
    "this determines @xmath34 and half of the fields @xmath35 in terms of the remaining fields , and also fixes the residual @xmath0 gauge symmetry . by abuse of notation",
    ", we denote the remaining independent fields by @xmath35 ( with a restricted range of @xmath36 , depending on the precise version of the ansatz ) .",
    "* when we now proceed to solve the time - reduced three - dimensional equations of motion , their particular structure allows us to obtain solutions in closed form .",
    "we remark that while some of the above ingredients are well known to people working on @xmath13 supergravity , it is critical that these elements are put together into a systematic structure .",
    "the key element that we use and preserve is electric - magnetic duality , which acts on the fields by symplectic transformations .",
    "our choice of variables , which all transform as symplectic tensors , leads to the simplifications and systematics that we exploit .",
    "we observe that this works despite the fact that the electric - magnetic duality group is broken to a discrete subgroup thereof by the presence of gauging ( a scalar potential ) , and despite the fact that our ansatz restricts us from the full symplectic group to a subgroup .",
    "solving the three - dimensional equations of motion directly results in an instanton solution depending on a number of integration constants , which are _ a priori _ undetermined .",
    "however , in order that this solution lifts to a _",
    "regular _ black brane in four dimensions we have to impose suitable regularity conditions .",
    "in particular , we require that the four - dimensional solution has a finite entropy density , which happens to simultaneously ensure that the scalar fields take finite values on the horizon . for",
    "a given set of charges and fluxes , we are then left with a two - parameter family of black brane solutions parametrised by a temperature @xmath4 and chemical potential @xmath5 , which can both be freely varied . in the limit of zero temperature , we recover the extremal nernst branes of @xcite .",
    "therefore we interpret our solutions as non - extremal ( or ` hot ' ) nernst branes . indeed",
    ", it turns out that the entropy density goes to zero as @xmath37 for fixed charges / fluxes , in agreement with the nernst law .",
    "our solutions interpolate between hyperscaling violating lifshitz geometries with @xmath6 at the horizon and @xmath7 at infinity , where @xmath38 is the dynamical critical exponent and where @xmath39 is the hyperscaling violating exponent . in the zero temperature limit",
    "the near horizon geometry changes to @xmath8 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ secrealform ]",
    "we review the real formulation of special geometry as applied to @xmath13 @xmath0 gauged supergravity with both electric and magnetic fluxes , relegating the more technical details to the appendices .",
    "we then reduce this theory over a time - like direction and determine the equations of motion of the three - dimensional theory for general static field configurations , before concentrating on the case of purely imaginary field configurations . in section  [ stusec ]",
    "we solve the aforementioned equations of motion for the case where we have a single electric charge and some number of electric fluxes .",
    "having found a solution to the three - dimensional equations of motion we then lift it back to a four - dimensional solution and determine the conditions imposed on the various integration constants by regularity , before carrying out an analysis of the properties of the solution . in section  [ secmagbrane ]",
    "we apply our method to the case where we instead switch on a single magnetic charge and a single magnetic flux , whilst keeping @xmath40 of the electric fluxes .",
    "section  [ secdiscussion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we also include a brief initial discussion of our results in the context of holography .",
    "we begin with the well - known bosonic lagrangian of @xmath13 fayet - iliopoulos @xmath41 gauged supergravity coupled to @xmath17 vector multiplets .",
    "our conventions follow those of  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 are four - dimensional spacetime indices , and @xmath44 label the four - dimensional gauge fields : @xmath17 from the vector multiplets and one , the graviphoton , from the gravity multiplet . for later convenience",
    "we use a formulation of the theory which contains @xmath45 complex scalar fields @xmath22 which are subject to local dilatations and @xmath0 transformations .",
    "the @xmath17 physical scalars remaining after gauge fixing can be parametrised as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . while the physical scalars @xmath20 parametrise a projective special khler ( psk ) manifold , the @xmath22 parametrise a conic affine special khler ( cask ) manifold , which is a complex cone over the psk manifold .",
    "conversely , the psk manifold can be obtained as the khler quotient of the cask manifold with respect to the @xmath24-action generated by dilatations and @xmath0 transformations . in physical terms",
    "this quotient amounts to gauge fixing the local @xmath24 action , as discussed below .",
    "all terms in ( [ 4dlag ] ) except the scalar potential @xmath48 are completely determined by the holomorphic prepotential @xmath27 , which is homogeneous of degree 2 . prior to gauge fixing dilatations , the space - time ricci scalar , @xmath49 , is multiplied by the conformal compensator @xmath50 where derivatives of the prepotential are denoted @xmath51 , etc .",
    "the tensor @xmath52 is the horizontal lift of the physical ( psk ) scalar metric to the cask manifold .",
    "it has a two - dimensional kernel which reflects the fact that the @xmath22 only represent @xmath17 complex physical degrees of freedom .",
    "the vector couplings are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath24 gauge fixing .",
    "dilatations are fixed by imposing the d - gauge @xmath55 which in particular brings the einstein - hilbert term in ( [ 4dlag ] ) to the standard form @xmath56 .",
    "likewise @xmath0 transformations can be fixed by imposing any condition transverse to the @xmath0 action , such as @xmath57 . however , as discussed in more detail in  @xcite , it is often advantageous to postpone @xmath0 gauge fixing until reducing the theory and starting to solve the resulting equations of motion . in particular , upon imposing the d - gauge one has @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the positive definite ( psk ) metric of the physical scalars @xmath20 . working with the scalars",
    "@xmath22 has the advantage that we retain covariance under symplectic transformations , and will result in a more convenient form of the equations of motion after reduction .",
    "note that while the d - gauge removes one real degree of freedom from the @xmath22 , the second unphysical degree of freedom is taken care of by the remaining local @xmath0 symmetry , see @xcite for details .",
    "geometrically , imposing the d - gauge while keeping the local @xmath0 symmetry corresponds to working on a @xmath0 principal bundle over the psk manifold .",
    "the four - dimensional lagrangian also includes a scalar potential @xmath60 , which as in  @xcite is given as @xmath61 with a superpotential of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 parametrize the @xmath0 gauging .",
    "since superpotentials of the form ( [ superpot ] ) arise in flux compactifications , we refer to them as magnetic and electric fluxes , respectively .",
    "note that we have included an explicit factor of @xmath64 in using dimensional analysis .",
    "we will use this later to rewrite the potential in terms of real variables . for reference , we note that the @xmath22 have mass dimension @xmath65 while the flux parameters have dimension @xmath66 , so that @xmath67 has dimension @xmath68 . since @xmath69 and , hence , its inverse @xmath70 are homogeneous of degree 0 , they have dimension 0 , and @xmath71 has dimension @xmath72 , as required",
    ". we also remark that for later convenience we have re - scaled the flux parameters by a factor of 2 relative to @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have not factorized the flux parameters into a dimensionful coupling and dimensionless parameters , but kept them dimensionful .      imposing that the background is stationary , so that all of the fields are independent of time",
    ", we can reduce the four - dimensional action over a time - like direction in order to obtain an effective three - dimensional euclidean action .",
    "we decompose the four - dimensional metric as @xmath73 where @xmath29 and @xmath74 are the kaluza - klein scalar and vector respectively , and we have left the three - dimensional part of the metric undetermined for now . following the procedure for time - like dimensional reduction outlined in @xcite , and noting that the scalar potential remains unchanged throughout the reduction process , one obtains the three - dimensional lagrangian @xcite @xmath75 we have written all of the three - dimensional degrees of freedom using the conventions of the real formulation of special geometry developed in @xcite , and afterwards set @xmath76 for the remainder of the paper .",
    "while we give a brief summary here , more details can be found in appendix  [ appendix : realspecial ] .",

    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to a class of prepotentials of the form @xmath93 where the function @xmath19 is homogeneous of degree three and real - valued when evaluated on real fields . for the case of ungauged @xmath13 supergravity ,",
    "such models were considered in @xcite .",
    "note that those models with @xmath19 a cubic polynomial are precisely the ` very special ' prepotentials for which the solutions can be uplifted to five dimensions .",
    "since we choose to fix the @xmath0 gauge by taking @xmath94 , this is equivalent to setting @xmath95 to zero .",

    ", we extend the pi condition to the fluxes @xmath103 by imposing @xmath104 which sets @xmath105 .",

    "however , a similar behaviour can occur for domain wall solutions in gauged supergravity which , for lack of more symmetric solutions , are interpreted as ground states .",
    "sometimes this interpretation can be further justified by an embedding into string theory or m - theory , see for example @xcite .",
    "while we leave studying the string theory embedding of our solutions for future work , we remark that the interpretation is consistent with a limit where the temperature is zero and the chemical potential infinite .",

    "let us first consider the extremal ( @xmath317 ) solution with @xmath250 . since this is the gravitational ground state solution with @xmath8 , zero temperature and infinite chemical potential , we expect it to be dual to the ground state of a @xmath319-dimensional qft with hyperscaling exponent @xmath320 and lifshitz exponent @xmath321 .",

    "we now move on to consider what happens at finite chemical potential @xmath326 , which corresponds to @xmath248 . in this case",
    ", the extremal nernst brane interpolates between a hvlif geometry with @xmath8 at the horizon , and a hvlif with @xmath7 at infinity , which is conformal to @xmath274 .",
    "one possible interpretation is as an rg flow between two qfts : one with hyperscaling exponent @xmath327 in the uv ; and one with hyperscaling exponent @xmath320 and lifshitz exponent @xmath321 in the ir . as the gravity solution is smooth , and we do not seem to have a natural candidate for an order parameter identifying a phase transition , we think that the more likely interpretation is that the uv ` phase ' and the ir ` phase ' are related by smooth crossover . for the ir theory",
    "we expect that the entropy scales like @xmath328 , which agrees with the behaviour of the nernst brane solution for low temperature @xmath329 . adding temperature changes the near horizon geometry , but leaves the asymptotic geometry at infinity unchanged , which is consistent with interpreting these configurations as thermal states .",
    "we therefore expect that the ir behaviour is correctly described by the nernst brane solution , which in turn predicts a scaling @xmath330 of the entropy for high temperatures , @xmath331 .",
    "this however does not agree with the expected scaling of our tentative uv theory with @xmath7 , which predicts @xmath332 .",
    "we also note that the asymptotic uv geometry , while conformal to @xmath274 , can not be interpreted as an alternative ground state of our supergravity theory , because it is not , when taken as a global geometry , part of our family of solutions . moreover",
    ", the physical scalar fields @xmath333 run off to infinity in the uv region , which indicates strong coupling or decompactification .",
    "taken together this suggests that the description in terms of our four - dimensional gauged supergravity theory is incomplete in the uv , and that further degrees of freedom become relevant .",
    "if we accept that the uv geometry correctly captures the thermodynamic behaviour then the corresponding uv theory should have a scaling behaviour @xmath334 ( @xmath335 ) .",
    "the resulting tentative phase diagram is shown in figure  [ phasediagram ] .",
    "the above mentioned analogy with domain walls together with the runaway behaviour of the scalars suggests to interpret the uv behaviour as a decompactification limit and to embed the four - dimensional supergravity theory into a higher dimensional theory . since the class of prepotentials that we have considered in this paper includes those ` very special ' prepotentials for which the theory can be uplifted to five dimensions , the most obvious embedding is into five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "there are grounds to believe  @xcite that the dimensional reduction of theories admitting @xmath336 vacua would admit vacua with some nontrivial hvlif behaviour .",
    "therefore we expect that by lifting our solutions to five dimensions we will obtain new asymptotically @xmath337 finite temperature solutions in @xmath13 gauged supergravity which still satisfy the nernst law hot nernst solutions were constructed in  @xcite , their solutions do not reduce to the finite temperature solutions presented here . ]",
    ". we will expand on this point in @xcite , and remark that an asymptotic @xmath337 leads to a scaling of the entropy @xmath338 , ( @xmath339 ) , which is consistent with our proposed uv theory .",
    "we should also point out that there are issues with the interpretation of our solutions if the temperature is strictly zero , since the nernst brane solution has infinite tidal forces and run - away behaviour of the scalars at the horizon in the extremal limit .",
    "this again indicates a breakdown of the effective description , and strictly speaking the supergravity solution should only be trusted at low but finite temperature .",
    "thus , as in the similar case of the holographic interpretation of hyperscaling violating solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton theories @xcite , the nernst brane solution is not a valid description of its ( tentative ) dual over the full range of the energy ( radial coordinate ) from the uv ( infinity ) to the ir ( horizon ) , but only over a finite interval outside the horizon .",
    "we leave it to future work to characterize the range of validity more quantitatively , and to identify the necessary completions in the uv and ir using a string theory embedding .",
    "one possible strategy to further investigate the zero temperature limit is to adapt formalisms that allow to include higher derivative terms . in @xmath1 supergravity a certain class of higher derivative terms ( those encoded in the so - called weyl multiplet ) , which are related to the topological string , lead to a generalization of the framework of special geometry , on which we relied in the article @xcite .",
    "one could also try to adapt the entropy function formalism @xcite , which employs universal properties of near horizon geometries and does not depend on supersymmetry .",
    "finally we comment on further possible future directions on the gravity side . here",
    "it would be interesting to find solutions where other and possibly more charges and fluxes have been turned on .",
    "we expect that our formalism is particularly suited to finding dyonic solutions , due to its built - in electric - magnetic covariance @xcite . for work in this direction",
    "it is encouraging that work on static bps solutions in @xmath0 gauged supergravity solutions with symmetric scalar target spaces has led to the construction of the general dyonic solution @xcite .",

    ", we obtain @xmath380 which determines @xmath29 in terms of the scalar fields @xmath379 .    due to the homogeneity properties of the prepotential and hesse potential ,",
    "we can obtain a real parametrization which is based on the rescaled complex scalars @xmath379 .",
    "the associated real coordinates are defined by the decomposition @xmath381 as @xmath382    furthermore , after reducing to three dimensions it is possible to write the gauge degrees of freedom using scalar fields as well . in particular , we define @xmath383 where @xmath384 are the components of the four - dimensional gauge fields @xmath385 along the reduction direction , and @xmath386 are the hodge - duals of the three - dimensional vector parts . specifically , these scalars descend from the four - dimensional field strengths as follows : @xmath387 where @xmath388 are defined as @xmath389 we can make further use of hodge duality to encode the kaluza - klein vector degree of freedom using the scalar field @xmath34 @xcite , although we will not need this here since we deal only with static configurations .    in terms of rescaled complex scalars",
    "@xmath379 and rescaled real variables @xmath25 , the relation between prepotential @xmath390 and hesse potential @xmath28 is @xmath391 we also note that the d - gauge , when expressed in terms of rescaled real scalars , reads @xmath392    in the lagrangian  , we also use the tensor field @xmath393 this tensor can be interpreted as a metric on the cask manifold , which is related to @xmath394 by flipping the signature along the radial direction generated by the field @xmath395 , combined with a conformal transformation which changes the scale transformation @xmath396 , where @xmath397 , from being a homothety to being an isometry .",
    "this follows from the obvious fact that while @xmath398 is homogeneous of degree @xmath399 , @xmath400 is homogeneous of degree @xmath401 . note that the metric coefficients @xmath394 and @xmath80 are homogeneous of degrees 0 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "both tensors are related by @xmath402    it will be convenient for us to introduce a set of dual coordinates with respect to the metric @xmath80 defined by @xmath403 one can show that @xmath404 where we have used that @xmath405 is homogeneous of degree @xmath65 for the first identity and the chain rule for the second .      finally , we re - express the scalar potential in terms of variables adapted to dimensional reduction .",
    "since , as we remarked , the expression in the square brackets of ( [ v ] ) is homogeneous of degree zero , it remains invariant if we rescale the real coordinates @xmath25 by @xmath408 . to express @xmath71 in terms of the tensor @xmath80 we use the relation to write @xmath409.\\ ] ] finally",
    ", we use   to re - write @xmath71 in terms of the dual coordinates @xmath85 , and take into account that upon dimensional reduction the term @xmath410 in the lagrangian gets multiplet by @xmath411 and obtain @xmath412.\\ ] ] [ 2]#2            x.  dong , s.  harrison , s.  kachru , g.  torroba , and h.  wang , _ aspects of holography for theories with hyperscaling violation _",
