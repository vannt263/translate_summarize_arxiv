    "one of the open questions of traffic dynamics is a microscopic understanding of the observed wide variations in the time - headway distributions @xcite that are closely related to the wide scattering of flow - density data in the congested regime @xcite , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "apart from their wide variations , the average values of the time headways depend strongly on the traffic density . for congested traffic , the modal value , i.e. , the value where the distribution has its maximum , is larger by a factor of about 2 compared to free traffic .",
    "figure [ figemp](a ) shows a typical example obtained from single - vehicle detector data of the dutch freeway a9 from haarlem to amsterdam .    with the increasing availability of single - vehicle data @xcite ,",
    "further statistical properties of traffic became the subject of investigation such as the velocity variance as a function of the traffic density @xcite , or the distribution of the times - to - collision ( ttc ) , which plays an important role for traffic safety @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore propose a variance - driven adaptation mechanism , according to which drivers increase their safety time gaps @xmath0 when the local traffic dynamics is unstable or largely varying .",
    "this adaptation is , e.g. , reflected in the empirically observed increase of the variation coefficient @xmath1 and offers a safety - oriented interpretation of the capacity drop , i.e. , the significant reduction of traffic flow when it becomes unstable @xcite .",
    "variance - driven time headways can also qualitatively explain the distribution of times - to - collision , which is surprisingly invariant with respect to density changes ( compared to distance , time gap , or velocity distributions ) .",
    "times - to - collision are , therefore , not only an interesting measure for traffic safety , but also a meaningful variable of behaviorally - oriented traffic models based on the physical approach of invariants @xcite .",
    "the variance - driven increase of the safety time gap @xmath0 may also be seen as an alternative to a frustration - driven increase of @xmath0 after a long time in congested traffic @xcite .",
    "moreover , it potentially overcomes the criticism of traffic models with a fundamental diagram by kerner @xcite , as it causes a pronounced platooning effect when traffic flow is perturbed or unstable .",
    "this guarantees a wide gap distribution which is the main prerequisite to reproduce the wide scattering of flow - density data in congested traffic @xcite .",
    "previous explanations of the wide scattering of flow - density data include stochastic effects @xcite , and sustained non - equilibrium states caused by dynamic instabilities such as stop - and - go traffic @xcite .",
    "stochastic terms are included in most cellular - automaton traffic models @xcite and also in some car - following models , e.g. , in the gipps - model @xcite or in recent car - following models proposed by kerner @xcite or wagner @xcite .",
    "another explanation of the scattering is based on the heterogeneity of vehicles ( such as cars and trucks ) and driving styles ( such as defensive or aggressive ) @xcite .",
    "however , while all these effects can possibly account for the observed variations of time headways and times - to - collision , at least for a given traffic density , the scattering of flow - density data would be smaller than observed due to the averaging implied in aggregating single - vehicle data to , e.g. , one - minute data @xcite .    in the next section",

    "for example , we did not use the full information of all vehicle trajectories for plotting the spatiotemporal dynamics of the velocity . instead",
    ", we have restricted ourselves to virtual detectors , as this approach allows a _ direct _ comparison with empirical traffic data .",
    "we note that an understanding of the effects of the velocity variance is crucial for devising measures to avoid traffic breakdowns : the vdt feedback mechanism is triggered most likely near sources of sustained velocity variations , for example in the merging , diverging , or weaving zones near freeway intersections , but also the noise term plays a role . to illustrate that , we have introduced a sustained velocity perturbation in all simulations of sec .",

    "[ figfund](a ) and ( b ) by letting accelerating ramp vehicles merge with only half the velocity of the vehicles on the main road . in simulations where the ramp vehicles entered with the speed of the vehicles on the main road",
    ", we observed a markedly delayed traffic breakdown occurring only after a traffic - flow peak near 3000 vehicles / h instead of 2500 vehicles / h , cf .",
    "[ figfund](c ) .",
    "the subsequent breakdown , however , was more severe showing not only synchronized traffic but also jammed traffic with nearly vanishing flows . eliminating the noise term alone had a smaller effect ( fig .",
    "[ figfund](b ) ) .",
    "thus , it is essential to avoid merging and diverging maneuvers at high velocity differences , e.g. , by increasing the length of the acceleration lane at on - ramps and off - ramps .",
    "another measure to reduce the velocity variance are speed limits which can be simulated with the vdt as well .",
    "furthermore , since lane changes constitute another source of velocity variance , we expect a strong coupling of lane changes to the longitudinal dynamics by the vdt mechanism .",
    "in particular , a multi - lane generalization of the vdt @xcite might yield a fully quantitative explanation of bottleneck effects introduced by weaving zones and off - ramps .",
    "finally , the distinct increase of the time headways after traffic breakdown opens up vehicle - based options to increase traffic performance and stability by means of adaptive - cruise control ( acc ) systems .",
    "such driver - assistance systems , which accelerate and brake automatically depending on the distance to the preceding vehicle and its velocity , are already commercially available for some upper - class vehicles . by a suitable strategy for varying the time headways of acc systems as a function of the traffic situation , the unfavorable human behavior can be partially compensated for .",
    "first simulations of such acc - systems show promising results @xcite ."
