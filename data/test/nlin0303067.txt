    "the conservation laws are the most important object in the classical mechanics as well as in the field theory .",
    "there are many different methods of the constructions of these laws .",
    "the most popular , especially used in the soliton theory and in the hydrodynamics , utilize the so called recursion operator or lax operator formalism @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it appeared that for the nonlinear schroedinger equation it is possible to find one series of conserved hamiltonians using recursion operator only .",
    "however for the shallow water equation , which is the dispersionless limit of the nonlinear schroedinger equation , there is additional series of conserved densities which is impossible to obtain by recursion operator ( see for example @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we would like to show that it is possible to construct new extra series of conserved densities for the polytropic gas model and nonlinear elasticity equation @xcite avoiding using recursion operator or lax formalism .",
    "more precisely we generate many nonequivalent hamiltonians of the given dimensions , using symmetry operator .",
    "our hamiltonians are non polynomial expressions which contains logarithmic functions .",
    "independently we consider the singular case , for the polytropic gas system for which @xmath1 . for this system we constructed new series of non homogeneous solutions expressed in terms of the elementary functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we describe the basic properties of the polytropic gas system which we use in the next sections . in the second section",
    "we describe our symmetry approach where we utilize the shift , scaling and projective operators in order to generate the conserved densities . in the third section we present explicitly new series of the conserved densities for different , physically interesting , models of the polytropic gas system with @xmath2 . in the last section",
    "we adopt our formalism to the degenerated case @xmath0 which is obtained from the contraction of the previous case .",
    "we show that in this case the conserved densities are connected with the bessel equation .",
    "the theory of the hydrodynamical type systems of the nonlinear equations @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are some functions , integrable by the generalized hodograph method @xcite is closely related to the over - determined systems of first order partial differential linear equations .",
    "the conservation laws are such that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is density and @xmath8 is flux",
    ". then densities satisfy @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the so called riemann invariants in which the hydrodynamic type system ( [ 1 ] ) is rewritten in the diagonal form @xmath12 and no summation on the repeated indices .",
    "thus , ( [ 2 ] ) is a linear systems of _ first _ order partial differential equations with variable coefficients .",
    "the general solution of such system is determined up to @xmath13 arbitrary functions of a single variable .",
    "there are many particular cases of the system ( [ 2 ] ) for which a general solution is expressed in explicit and in compact form ( @xcite ) . if we can not to find a general solution of such system , then alternative way to solve the cauchy or goursat problems is to create the infinite number of particular solutions @xcite .",
    "it appeared that the conserved densities can be used in the construction of particular solutions . indeed .",
    "let us consider the polytropic gas @xmath14,\\ ] ] and nonlinear elasticity equations @xmath15,\\ ] ] which are the commuting flows to each other .",
    "the solution of the first system obtained by hodograph method is @xmath16 while for the second is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some solution of the tricomi like equation @xmath19 the previous equation is nothing but the equation on the conservation law densities for both systems",
    ". formulas ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) realize the general or particular solution for both systems if @xmath18 is the general or particular solution of the equation ( [ 6 ] ) respectively .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    "two infinite serieses of _ quasi linear _",
    "conservation laws were constructed for the polytropic gas and for the nonlinear elasticity equations respectively . _ quasi linear _ means , that these conservation law densities are polynomials with respect to @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary polytropic constant .",
    "however , as we see in the next section , these densities does not exhaust the set of all possible conserved densities .",
    "let us first consider the more general form of the polytropic gas system @xmath25 , \\\\",
    "\\eta _ { y } & = & u_{x } , \\qquad \\qquad u_{y}=\\partial _ { x}f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\eta ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is an arbitrary function .",
    "our generalized system constitute hamiltonian equations with the following local structure @xmath27 where @xmath28dx , \\ \\nonumber\\\\   \\tilde{h } & = & \\int [ \\frac{u^{2}}{2}+f^{\\prime}(\\eta ) ] dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to obtain the conserved densities we try to eliminate the differentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 from the corresponding conservation laws @xmath31 by direct calculation we have @xmath32du+[\\eta f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } ( \\eta ) h_{u}+uh_{\\eta } ] d\\eta\\ ] ] the compatibility conditions ( @xmath33 ) lead to the tricomi - like equation @xmath34 since , this equation is compatible with the shift symmetry operator ( see @xcite ) @xmath35 one can search solutions in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "this is the eigenvalue problem for the shift symmetry operator .",
    "then tricomi - like equation is transformed to the linear ordinary differential equation @xmath38 however this equation can not be solved explicitly for an arbitrary @xmath26 .",
    "we propose , from that reason , quite different approach .",
    "let us observe that the shift symmetry operator transforms one solution of the tricomi - like equation onto another one @xmath39 it means that all conservation law densities @xmath40 and corresponding fluxes @xmath41 can be written down in the quadratures recursively @xmath42du+[\\eta f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } ( \\eta ) h_{k}+uq_{k}]d\\eta .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] interestingly all known examples of the conserved densities could be obtained in this way .",
    "however we demonstrate different possibilities which give us new serieses of the conserved densities .",
    "our main idea is based on the following observation .    the tricomi like equation ( [ 6 ] ) is compatible with three local symmetry operators :    \\1 . shift operator @xmath43    \\2 .",
    "scaling operator @xmath44    \\3 . projective operator @xmath45\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial u}+u\\eta \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\eta } + \\frac{\\gamma -3}{4}u . \\label{algebra}\\ ] ] these operators , with the identity operator , constitute closed lie algebra , with the following commutation relation @xmath46 = { 2\\over \\gamma-1 } r + { \\gamma-3\\over 4 } , \\qquad   \\big [ \\delta , r \\big ] = \\delta ,   \\qquad \\big [ r , s   \\big ] = s \\label{com}\\ ] ] they act on _ homogeneous _ conservation law densities as follows @xmath47 where @xmath48 are degree of homogeneity .",
    "thus , by combination of these symmetry operators one can describe all quasi linear conservation law densities .",
    "interestingly if we rewrite the tricomi -like equation using the riemann invariants we obtain the famous euler - darboux - poisson equation @xmath49 , \\label{tricom1}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 now the symmetry operators are @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the `` zero  solutions '' of the shift operator @xmath52 @xmath53 can be found immediately @xmath54 while for the projective operator one can obtain @xmath55 etc .",
    "the `` zero  solutions '' of projective operator are easy to obtain also from riemann invariant ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) form @xmath58 if we shift the riemann invariants , in this formula , on arbitrary parameter @xmath59 we obtain the generating function on the conservation law densities .",
    "when @xmath60 we can obtain known densities .    in order to obtain new densities",
    "we demonstrate quite different possibilities .",
    "let us consider the following recursive chain @xmath61 , \\quad   rh_{k}^{(2)}=c_{k}[h_{k}^{(2)}+h_{k}^{(1 ) } ] \\label{8}\\ ] ] etc ... , where @xmath62 are the quasi linear conserved densities .",
    "now @xmath63 are new conserved densities which satisfy the tricomi - like equation ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "notice that the second formula in ( [ 7 ] ) is not in contradiction to previous chain because formula ( [ 7 ] ) is valid for homogeneous conservation laws only .",
    "now let us consider the shallow water equation , e.g. the polytropic gas system with @xmath64 .",
    "let us choose the first homogeneous solutions of ( [ 7 ] ) @xmath65 etc . as the result we obtained that @xmath66 are conserved density also .",
    "in the next let us apply this procedure to the @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "we obtained rather complicated formulas which contain the logarithm in the second power .",
    "now we can continue this procedure obtaining complicated formulas which contain the logarithm in higher powers . on the other side we can combine our method with this which generate quasi linear densities obtaining following diagram        this diagram obviously is closed . in order to see it let us start consideration from some @xmath71 .",
    "applying at first projective and at next step scaling transformations we obtain @xmath72 finally applying these operators in the reverse order we obtain @xmath73 using the commutation relation ( [ com ] ) we see that these formulas coincide because @xmath74 .",
    "for an arbitrary @xmath23 our generating equations become @xmath75 now we have to solve the tricomi like equation on @xmath71 which is however rather hard to do .",
    "we restrict , from that reason , to two cases where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "for the first case we have @xmath78 . by direct verification one can check that @xmath79 where @xmath80 satisfy ( [ general ] ) .",
    "the tricomi like equation reduces in this case to @xmath81    for the second case we have @xmath82 .",
    "similarly to the first case , by direct verification , one can check that @xmath83 satisfy ( [ general ] ) . substituting @xmath67 to the tricomi like equation ( [ 6 ] )",
    "we obtain the following equation on the function @xmath84 @xmath85 in both cases it is possible to obtain closed formulas for particular values of @xmath23 parameter .",
    "however we can simplify our consideration using different coordinates .",
    "for example choosing the coordinates @xmath86 and @xmath87 as @xcite @xmath88 we can rewrite the scaling symmetry operator and tricomi like equation as @xmath89 taking into an account @xmath90 we obtained the following solutions on the @xmath91 densities @xmath92 finally let us present the solution for @xmath93 and @xmath94 which are interesting from the physical point because these describe dynamics of one - atomic gas and two - atomic gas @xcite and two dimensional nonlinear born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite respectively .",
    "for this case the polytropic gas and the nonlinear elasticity systems are @xmath97.\\ ] ] @xmath98 respectively . for this case the euler - darboux - poisson equation ( [ tricom1 ] ) degenerates because @xmath99 .",
    "similarly the scaling operator @xmath100 ( see ( [ scala ] ) ) also becomes degenerated .    in order to solve this problem",
    "we notice that the analogue of the symmetry algebra ( [ algebra ] ) can be obtained considering the contraction with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "if we rescale @xmath101 and compute the limit when @xmath102 we obtain @xmath103    interestingly now , in the contraction limit , the homogeneity properties ( [ 7 ] ) does not hold .",
    "it means that the tricomi - like equation @xmath104has no any homogeneous solutions .",
    "however the quasi - homogeneous solutions could be obtained ( @xcite ) . by quasi - homogeneous",
    "we understand the homogeneous with respect to the one variable @xmath105 or @xmath106 .    for our further applications",
    "we describe another possibility .",
    "we constructed the generating function for the conserved densities . to end this we consider the eigenvalue problem for each symmetry operator .",
    "\\1 . for the scaling operator @xmath100 ( see ( [ symetr ] ) ) the eigenvalue problem @xmath107 where @xmath108 , reduces the tricomi - like equation to the linear ordinary differential equation of the second order @xmath109    these equations can be easily integrated and we obtained @xmath110 .",

    "if one expands function @xmath18 near @xmath115 or @xmath116 , then one can obtain two well - known infinite serieses of conservation law densities ( @xcite ) .",

    "finally we can use the shift or scaling symmetry operators and generate some conserved densities as we did in the previous sections .",
    "in this paper we constructed new extra series of conserved densities for the polytropic gas model and nonlinear elasticity equation avoiding using recursion operator or lax formalism .",
    "our hamiltonians appeared as the non polynomial expressions which contain logarithmic functions .",
    "if we continue our procedure to these logarithmic densities in the next step we obtain expressions with the logarithmic function in an arbitrary power .",
    "we considered the singular case of the polytropic gas system also , for which we found the non homogeneous solutions expressed in terms of bessel functions .",
    "if we apply the point transformation to the symmetry operators then they can change the role .",
    "it means that the scaling and shift operators are equivalent to each other , what it easy to see in the riemann invariants ( [ sim ] ) or ( [ sim1],[sim2 ] ) .",
    "we presented this method for two hydrodynamical systems only , but this method can be adopted to more complicated equations as well .",
