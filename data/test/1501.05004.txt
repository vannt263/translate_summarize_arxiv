    "characterized by a change in the macroscopic order of a physical system , phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature .",
    "contrary to thermodynamical phase transitions , which occur at finite temperature , quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) take place at zero temperature , driven by quantum fluctuations @xcite . indeed , being linked with energies level crossings in the ground state , qpts can occur even at finite temperature , as long as the system can not be excited by the thermal fluctuations . a candidate system to study these kinds of phenomena is a quantum spin chain , which can present several distinct phases @xcite .",
    "many interesting physical systems exhibit qpts , among which we mention the superfluid to insulating @xcite and the superconducting to insulating @xcite transitions for bosonic systems while , for fermionic ones , we have the spin wave density to a magnetic phase @xcite and the quantum spin glass to paramagnetic phase transitions @xcite as examples .",
    "a remarkable feature of qpts is that , in the neighbourhood of a critical point , the system becomes strongly correlated , and its correlation length diverges at this point @xcite .",
    "this has suggested that quantum correlations should be maximum near the transition point , fact that was verified in seminal works about entanglement measures in critical systems @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review regarding entanglement in many - body systems ) . as a natural consequence , other measures of quantum correlations",
    "were also employed to investigate the properties of qpts , such as quantum discord @xcite and related quantities @xcite .    within the last decade , quantum correlations other than entanglement were discovered @xcite and their importance for quantum information processing has only increased @xcite .",
    "the origin of such correlations lies in the existence of quantum coherence among different partitions of a quantum system , being present even in separable states ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . among all the quantum correlation measures ,",
    "the so - called local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) stands out as a bona fide measure with a good computability and a close mathematical expression for any qubit - qudit bipartite system @xcite .",
    "this measure is based on the skew information , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to quantify the uncertainty in the measurement of an observable .",
    "the lqu is defined just as the minimazation of this quantity over all possible observables . beyond its importance as a quantum correlation quantifier",
    ", lqu is also related with the quantum fisher information @xcite , which makes it very important for quantum metrology .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that it is also connected with the speed of evolution of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "these are some of the reasons that lead us to choose lqu as a tool to investigate critical behaviour .    here",
    "we study local quantum uncertainty in critical systems considering two spin-@xmath3 chains , described by the anisotropic @xmath1 hamiltonian and the @xmath1 model with three spins interaction , named @xmath2 model @xcite , which contains the spin - liquid phase @xcite that only recently could be experimentally investigated @xcite .",
    "we consider the zero temperature case , making some comments about finite temperature in the last section .",
    "several works have addressed the critical behaviour of the @xmath1 model from the point of view of quantum information , considering quantum and classical correlations quantifiers as tools for the identification of quantum phase transitions ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the local quantum uncertainty was also computed for some instances of this model and its usefulness for the identification of the qpt was verified @xcite .",
    "however , the case of the @xmath2 spin chain received much little attention . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors demonstrated that quantum discord @xcite and classical correlations @xcite are good indicators for the critical behaviour of this model , while entanglement measures were considered in ref .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to contribute to this debate by investigating how local quantum uncertainty behaves for the @xmath2 model .",
    "we also provide a complementary analysis of the usual @xmath1 hamiltonian , presented in ref . @xcite . while the @xmath1 hamiltonian is investigated in the thermodynamic system , for the @xmath2 model we consider a finite chain .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the definition of the local quantum uncertainty while section iii is devoted to present both models and our results .",
    "the final considerations are done in iv .",
    "the lqu was introduced in order to quantify the minimal quantum uncertainty that could be attainable in a measurement of a local observable @xcite .",
    "this minimal uncertainty comes from the existence of quantum correlations between the system being measured and the rest of the universe .",
    "based on this fact , a measure of quantum correlations was then proposed @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be the state of a bipartite system and @xmath5 some local observable on one of the partitions , from here on called the system .",
    "lqu is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7^{2}\\right)\\ ] ] is the so - called skew information @xcite , which is a measure of the non - commutativity between the state and the observable .",
    "the minimum is taken over the set of all observables acting on the considered partition .",
    "strictly speaking , the definition of @xmath8 should take into account the spectrum of the observable being measured .",
    "each different choice of the spectrum leads us to a different family of measures .",
    "however , if the system is a qubit , as in the present article , the spectrum does not change the behaviour of @xmath8 ( except for a global multiplicative constant ) , therefore we do not explicitly considered it in the definition ( [ lqu ] ) , as originally done @xcite . moreover , as we are dealing only with qubits ( spin@xmath0 particles ) , we consider the following general form for the local observable @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pauli vector operator and @xmath11 .",
    "this enables one to compute a closed , analytical , form for lqu @xcite @xmath12 where the matrix @xmath13 has the following elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "as lqu quantifies the minimum _ quantum uncertainty _ in a measurement performed on the system , it is zero only when the state of the system commutes with some observable , which implies that the local system is not quantum correlated with anything else .",
    "note that the existence of this uncertainty ( even in the presence of a flawless apparatus ) is caused only by the probabilistic character of the quantum measurement .",
    "in other words , if the system of interest is correlated with some other system , its reduced state can not be an eigenstate of any local observable , thus inevitably leading to a non - vanishing variance .",
    "in the following section we employ this tool to study the critical behaviour of two spin chains , showing that it is a very good candidate for pinpoint quantum phase transitions in both models .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we consider two distinct models , the @xmath1 spin chain with two and three spins interaction .",
    "the case of two spins interaction was recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the focus of that work is the so called local quantum coherence , as measured by the skew information defined in the preceding section , in the @xmath1 model .",
    "although @xmath8 is an extremization of @xmath16 , here we extend the analysis reported in ref .",
    "@xcite considering the entire range of the anisotropic parameter . moreover , we focus in the case of three spins interaction model , which was not considered in ref . @xcite .",
    "we describe here the paradigmatic example of the @xmath1 model , which govern the dynamics of a spin@xmath0 chain under the effect of a magnetic field in @xmath17direction anisotropically interacting in the @xmath18 plane .",

    ", the hamiltonian ( [ hxy ] ) can be diagonalized , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath31 ) , in terms of spinless fermions operators @xcite . remembering that the model posses translational and parity symmetries @xcite , the reduced density matrix of two arbitrary spins can be written as @xmath32 .",

    "moreover , we are disregarding the effects of symmetry breaking ( see ref .",
    "@xcite to further details regarding this issue ) .",
    "this model presents a second order quantum phase transition at the critical point @xmath33 , for all values of @xmath34 , which is of an order - disorder type , separating the ferromagnetic from the paramagnetic phases @xcite .",
    "figure [ lqu_xy ] shows the local quantum uncertainty and its derivative for three relevant cases for the @xmath1 model , considering first - neighbours interactions .",
    "as we can see , the qpt at the critical point @xmath35 can be clearly identified by @xmath8 , as confirmed by its first derivative .",
    "the more pronounced identification is obtained by the @xmath24 model .",
    "we also observe that , beyond this divergence in the derivative of @xmath8 at the critical point , other discontinuities points are present .",
    "these points are related with the minimization process involved in the definition of @xmath8 and not with a qpt , which is related with a divergence presented in the derivative of the density matrix elements , as occurs at the critical point .",

    "it is interesting to note that these phases are independent of @xmath34 , i.e. , the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phase_xyt ] is the same independently of the value of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , to study the behaviour of the local quantum uncertainty near the critical points of this model , it is enough to pick just a single value of @xmath34 .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath8 ( and of its derivative with respect to @xmath22 ) will depend on @xmath34 , but the qualitative behaviour , the one which we are interested here , will be the same .",

    "again , the size of the chain only changes the quantitative character of the results , with the qualitative behaviour , i.e. , the ability of @xmath8 to signal the phase transitions of the model , being the same .",
    "it is important to observe here that it is not always true that a sudden change in the behaviour of @xmath8 is connected with a quantum phase transition . as a consequence of the extremization process involved in the definition of @xmath8 ,",
