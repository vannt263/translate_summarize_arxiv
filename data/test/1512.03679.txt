    "to estimate the mass of the red giant we used the fact that it pulsates with a period of 110 days ( kahabka @xcite ) .",
    "smc 3 lies on the sequence b in the k - log(p ) plane ( wood 2000 ) which suggests the first overtone pulsation . assuming the pulsation constant of q=0.04 we derived the mass of 2.3@xmath3  m@xmath1 . to carry out our analysis we used the startrack population synthesis code ( belczyski _ et al . _",
    "the code includes the wind accretion through bondi - hoyle mechanism , roche - lobe overflow , @xmath4 roche - lobe overflow and @xmath5 roche - lobe overflow . as initial conditions we adopted the current parameters of the system and then we modeled its future evolution .",
    "we assumed @xmath6=1.44  m@xmath1 and , since we studied the system in the sn ia context , a co  wd .",
    "for all of our models the system went trough a common envelope ( ce ) after @xmath7  yrs and for none of the models system wd managed to accumulate enough matter to become a type ia supernova . the orbital separation after the ce was relatively big ( a@xmath8r@xmath1 ) , which makes a merger in the hubble time unlikely .",
    "the obtained parameters of the system are presented in fig .",
    "we predict that the system will not become a type ia supernova in contrary to what was suggested in the literature ( orio _ et al . _",
    "the caveat is that our predicted mass transfer rate is somewhat lower then the one expected for the steady hydrogen burning on the surface of the white dwarf ( nomoto _ et al . _",
    "a lower @xmath9 then expected could be due to the fact that our model underestimates the rg mass loss trough wind by treating it as in the single star scenario , whereas there is a strong observational evidence that this wind is significantly enhanced due to tidal interactions in syst ( mikoajewska _ et al . _",
