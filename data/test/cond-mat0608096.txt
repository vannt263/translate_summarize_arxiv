    "since the prediction of keldysh and kopaev ,  @xcite there has been a long and intense pursuit to realise a condensed phase in solid state excitonic , and related , systems .",
    "in particular , polaritons in semiconductor microcavities , the coupled eigenstates of an exciton with a cavity photon ,  @xcite represent ideal candidates for observing condensation phenomena .",
    "the very light mass of these composite bosonic particles promises relatively high transition temperatures . in the past decade , improvements in the growth technology of semiconductor heterostructures have made the study of high - quality strongly - coupled planar microcavities almost routine for iii - v and ii - vi semiconductors .",
    "the high degree of external control of these systems , and the possibility of direct detection for them has opened the route towards a new generation of fast optical matter - wave lasers and amplifiers .",
    "@xcite more recently , concerted experimental efforts have been devoted to the realisation of a bose - einstein condensate of microcavity polaritons .",
    "@xcite    on the experimental side , a challenge to the realisation of a condensed polariton phase might be represented by the finite quality of the cavity mirrors and the resultant short polariton lifetime , of the order of picoseconds .",
    "in addition , due to the ` bottleneck effect ' ,  @xcite the relaxation of polaritons to the zero momentum state can be delayed , hindering the creation of a thermal population in the lowest energy state .",
    "it has however been recently shown  @xcite that thermalization processes due to particle - particle scattering can be dramatically magnified by increasing the value of the ( non - resonant ) pump power , and by positively detuning the cavity energy above the excitonic energy . under these conditions ,",
    "the progress towards a zero momentum quasi - equilibrium condensate has been significant ,  @xcite including a non - linear threshold behaviour in the emission intensity at zero momentum ,  @xcite the investigation of the second order coherence function ,  @xcite a characteristic change in the momentum space distribution above threshold ,  @xcite and evidence that the equilibration time is shorter than the polariton lifetime has been seen .",
    "@xcite finally , very recently , a clear demonstration of condensation of cavity polaritons has been demonstrated in cdte .",
    "@xcite kasprzak and collaborators have shown that condensation of equilibrated polaritons can be achieved for effective temperatures around @xmath0k and evidence for condensation has been seen in the occupation function , the first order coherence ( both in time and in space ) and in the spontaneous appearance of linear polarisation of the condensate emission .    alongside the experimental effort ,",
    "a significant theoretical effort has been invested in analysing properties and predicting signatures of polariton condensation .",
    "@xcite much of this work focuses on modelling the conditions under which condensation can occur , both in equilibrium ,  @xcite and considering the effects of pumping and decay .",
    "@xcite possible signatures include the nonlinear relation of emission at zero momentum to pumping power ,  @xcite changes to the linewidth ,  @xcite the pl spectrum and the angular distribution of radiation ,  @xcite and spontaneous polarisation of emitted radiation .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we discuss the optical properties of condensed polaritons , focusing our interests on absorption , photoluminescence ( pl ) and resonant rayleigh scattering ( rrs ) . from our study",
    "we conclude that rrs , the coherent scattering by disorder of polaritons into directions other than that of the original probe , represents a powerful tool for investigating the condensed phase .",
    "we will show that signatures of condensation are visible in the rrs spectrum , allowing a direct probe of the collective excitation properties of the polariton condensate .",
    "in particular , we will show that , above the threshold for condensation , strong emission from the collective sound mode both above and below the chemical potential can be seen in the rrs spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rrsca ] ) .",
    "in contrast such features are expected to be much harder to observe in usual pl emission spectra , where the spectrum is dominated by the very strong condensate emission at the chemical potential , which is likely to mask these more subtle features .",
    "in addition , we will show that the rrs spectra directly reflects the disorder averaged density of states of excitonic particle - hole like excitations , i.e. bound excitons coupled to the coherent photon field .     for @xmath1 as a function of the dimensionless momentum @xmath2 and rescaled energy @xmath3 , for zero detuning , rabi splitting @xmath4mev , temperature @xmath5k , and a disorder strength characterize by an inverse scattering time @xmath6mev .",

( the parameters chosen for these plots are the same as those used later for spectral weight and photoluminescence . ) the value of the chemical potential is explicitly marked [ horizontal green ( gray ) line ] . while in the non - condensed regime ,",
    "rrs emission is always above the chemical potential , in the condensed phase , emission from the collective sound mode is seen both above and below the chemical potential . ]",
    "resonant rayleigh scattering depends on disorder to scatter polaritons between momentum states . in order to carry on our analysis",
    ", we introduce a realistic description of disorder and analyse its effects on rrs and more generally on other optical probes , like absorption and pl .",
    "to do this , we make use of a quantitatively accurate model for exciton disorder ,  @xcite and numerically evaluate the distribution of excitonic energies and oscillator strengths associated with a given disorder potential .",
    "an accurate treatment of exciton disorder for quantum wells in microcavities is important because the large ratio of exciton mass to photon mass means that those exciton states contributing most to the thermally populated polaritons are strongly localised , i.e. can not be treated within the first born approximation .",
    "such a treatment shows that , for a given exciton energy and momentum , there is still a distribution of possible oscillator strengths . for the exciton states relevant",
    "to polariton formation , the distribution of oscillator strengths varies from a narrow gaussian at low energies ( below the band edge ) to a porter - thomas distribution at high energies , as is known from previous works .",
    "@xcite here , we study the effect of this distribution on the many - body physics , and in particular , on rrs and pl spectra .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case relevant to the existing cdte or gaas microcavities of high - quality quantum wells , where the typical excitonic disorder amplitude is smaller than the rabi splitting . in this regime",
    ", we can make use of the _ coupled oscillator model _ or wave vector conserving approximation , as explained in ref .  .",
    "as will be explained in more detail later on , this corresponds to approximating the full exciton green s function by its momentum - diagonal part ( or equivalently considering its disorder average ) , and treating perturbatively the off - diagonal terms . in this way",
    ", the translational invariance broken by the presence of the disorder is restored , polaritons have a defined wave vector and , at high enough densities , condense in the lowest momentum state .",
    "such a treatment implies that excitonic disorder , being on short length scales , does not lead to spatial inhomogeneity on the length scale associated with the polariton .",
    "extended polaritons are formed from a superposition of many localised excitons , therefore recovering translational invariance at the level of polaritons . at low densities , in the non - condensed state ,",
    "many observable properties can be adequately described by the coupled oscillator model and so can be found from the mean squared oscillator strength at a given energy . in this",
    "limit our method recovers the well known results for the inhomogeneous broadening of the polariton pl ,  @xcite and  by considering in addition the mean fourth power of the oscillator strength  the averaged rrs response .",
    "@xcite however , when condensed , there are observable effects associated with the full distribution of oscillator strengths . in particular , the non - vanishing probability of excitons to have arbitrarily small oscillator strengths",
    "has direct consequences for optical probes , including both rrs and pl .    in ref .  , we considered specific aspects of resonant rayleigh scattering arising from the model discussed in this paper . here ,",
    "we provide and compare further experimental probes of condensation , and discuss the underlying physical mechanisms involved .",
    "all these optical probes , including rrs , are in addition to a non - resonant pumping of the microcavity polaritons .",
    "a related problem is studied in ref .  . there ,",
    "the rayleigh scattering of a strong resonant pump is considered ( treating disorder perturbatively ) , thus the probe is the pump . in this paper , in contrast , one has to distinguish two types of coherence .",
    "the first type is the internal coherence of the condensed system , which arises spontaneously following non - resonant pumping .",
    "the second type is the coherent scattering of an external laser probe on disorder , which can be strongly modified by the presence of the condensate .",
    "the form of the density of states , optical density , and distribution of oscillator strengths found from the numerical calculations are also important in other thermodynamic properties and probes of polaritons .",
    "one such example is the calculation of the linear blue - shift vs. density in the low density regime .",
    "the inclusion of exciton states that couple weakly to photons extends the validity of the current model to densities beyond those in similar treatments ,  @xcite and provides a stronger basis for the use of those models in the regimes where they are valid .",

    "the problem of an exciton in a disordered quantum well has been studied at some length in the last two decades .",
    "@xcite quantum well disorder can arise due to interface and alloy fluctuations and affects the properties of the excitonic linewidth and absorption spectrum .",
    "similarly to refs .  , we will assume the external disorder potential to be correlated on a length scale larger than the exciton bohr radius .",
    "accordingly , we factorise the excitonic in - plane relative and centre of mass coordinates @xmath10 and assume that the disorder affects only the excitonic centre of mass motion @xmath11 , while the internal degrees of freedom can be restricted to the ground state hydrogenic state @xmath12 . here , @xmath13 is the exciton bohr radius and @xmath14 the reduced mass ( henceforth we will set @xmath15 ) . neglecting the transverse degrees of freedom related to the confinement of the excitons in the qw",

    "@xcite this can be approximated , e.g. , with a gaussian noise correlated on a length scale @xmath22 with variance equal to @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the quantisation area .",
    "it will be convenient , later on , to introduce the scattering time @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the two - dimensional density of states in the clean limit .    in two dimensional non - interacting systems",
    ", all states are localised by the disorder potential .",
    "however , the localisation length and the character of the excitonic wavefunction change significantly from below to above the band edge @xmath17 .",
    "well below the band edge , low - energy lifshitz tail states ,  @xcite are well localised in deep potential minima , with a nodeless ( roughly gaussian ) shape .",
    "these states are rare , because they occur due to large , rare , fluctuations of the disorder potential .",
    "in contrast , higher energy states above the band edge have a fractal - like shape with many nodes and can be approximated by a random superposition of plane waves with the same momentum @xmath28 . here",
    ", the localisation mechanism is closely related to quantum mechanical interference effects .",
    "accordingly , the change of the shape of the centre of mass wavefunctions across the band edge is accompanied by a dramatic change in the excitonic oscillator strength .",
    "@xcite the oscillator strength describing coupling of a quantum well exciton to light , @xmath29 , is given by the probability amplitude of finding an electron and a hole at the same position and with centre of mass momentum equal to the photon momentum @xmath30 and is therefore proportional to the fourier transform of the centre of mass wave function , @xmath31 : @xmath32 where , @xmath33 is the dipole matrix element .",

    "because there may be many different exciton wavefunctions corresponding to similar exciton energies , the oscillator strength @xmath39 is a random quantity , which varies both in phase and magnitude .",
    "considering many disorder realisations , we find a distribution of squared oscillator strengths , @xmath40 as a function of the energy @xmath19 and momentum @xmath30 .",
    "this distribution reflects the statistical properties of the centre of mass excitonic wave functions .    to compare to experimentally relevant observables",
    ", we introduce the density of states ( dos ) , @xmath41 and the mean squared oscillator strength : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the average over different disorder realisations .",
    "these quantities are related to the excitonic optical density by the relation : @xmath44 experimentally , the excitonic optical density can be measured by dividing the pl emission by the excitonic occupation .",
    "@xcite    focusing for the moment on average properties , rather than on the entire distribution , a simple expression exists for the mean squared oscillator strength in the high energy limit . in this limit ,",
    "where the dos is flat and energy independent , @xmath45 , making use of the born approximation , the squared average oscillator strength @xmath46 does not depend separately on the disorder potential correlation length @xmath47 and variance @xmath48 , but instead only on the scattering time @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gepsp ] ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the free particle dispersion . from this form , and the effectively constant density of states",
    ", one can see that both the mean squared oscillator strength and the excitonic optical density are symmetrical . the comparison of this approximate form to the numerical simulation",
    "is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gepsp ] ,    in contrast , for energies much below the band edge , the specific asymptotic expression of @xmath46 depends whether the correlation length @xmath47 is smaller or larger than the localisation length @xmath52 . in the white noise",
    "limit,@xcite @xmath53 , one can show that the centre of mass wavefunction @xmath11 can be approximated by a gaussian centred at a randomly distributed site @xmath54 , @xmath55 and therefore giving a squared oscillator strength proportional to : @xmath56 thus , here the distribution of squared oscillator strengths is very narrow , with a mean square value given by the above form .",
    "similarly , much theoretical ( and numerical ) work has been done to establish the energy dependence of the density of states . in the low energy tail , as before , the specific asymptotic form of the dos depends on the value of the correlation length @xmath47 . in the white noise limit , one can show that @xmath57 , while , in the opposite ( classical ) limit , @xmath58 , instead one has @xmath59 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "in general , for the finite values of the disorder correlation length corresponding to typical experiments , the regions in energy where one of these two analytical regimes apply are very restricted , and therefore a numerical analysis is required .",
    "numerical analysis is also essential in order to account for the distribution of squared oscillator strengths @xmath60 near the band edge .",
    "this distribution changes substantially from low energy states to high energy ones .",
    "as we discuss more in detail in the next section , for high energy states the oscillator strength distribution is governed by a porter - thomas law , while for lifshitz tail states the distribution follows a narrow gaussian - like distribution .",
    "neither of these distributions apply for energies around the band edge .",
    "however , it is states near the band edge that have the largest optical density , and so the distribution of oscillator strengths in this region has a significant impact on derived quantities .",
    "it thus becomes essential to use numerical analysis to find the entire distribution of oscillator strengths .",

    "[ fig : gepsp ] , for photons with zero momentum , the maximum value of the oscillator strength characterises excitonic states below the band edge which are more localised in nature .",
    "this can be easily understood by the following qualitative argument : at very low energies , the excitonic state is strongly localised in a deep potential minimum and has no nodes . increasing the energy , at first the localisation length increases [ e.g. , @xmath89 in the white noise limit ] and thus increases the oscillator strength . however , eventually , the wavefunction starts developing nodes and consequently the squared average oscillator strength decreases .",
    "when @xmath90 , only the high energy side of @xmath91 can be described by the born limit  . for the chosen values of the disorder potential correlation length @xmath47 and variance @xmath48 , an analytical expression for the low energy ( lifshitz ) tail is not known .",

    "[ fig : geps2 ] follows the free particle dispersion , plus a renormalisation down in energy , which decreases for higher photon momenta , i.e. these states are described well by free particles , including disorder in the first born approximation . at low momenta , the states which have the stronger oscillator strength",
    "are effectively localised .",
    "the crossover , as seen in the contour plot , happens at relatively large angle , @xmath92 , because of the large ratio of exciton to photon mass : the crossover momentum is set by exciton mass , but its conversion to an angle depends on effective photon mass . for a connected reason , the thermally populated polariton states are formed out of strongly localised ( i.e. beyond first born approximation ) excitonic states : for values of temperature and photon mass relevant for experiments , thermal population of polaritons extends up to around @xmath93 in momentum , which as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : geps2 ] corresponds to exciton states not accurately described by the born approximation .",

    "asymmetry of the optical density of quantum well excitons has been also measured experimentally ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , by dividing the measured pl by the excitonic occupation .    as mentioned earlier ,",

    "thus , as in the bosonic case , saturation effects are linear  @xcite and the blue - shift increases linearly in density .",
    "there is however an important difference to those previous works .",
    "in contrast to the clean systems studied there , our effective saturation interaction has a coefficient related to disorder and temperature rather than to the rabi splitting and bohr radius only .",

    "at the phase boundary , where @xmath145 , in contrast to inside the condensed phase , the squared oscillator strength appears only linearly in eq .  , this expression therefore involving only the optical density @xmath146 .",
    "it is clear that the standard bcs result can be thought of as a limiting case where the effective optical density is much wider than the temperature .",
    "@xcite in the opposite limit , of a narrow delta - like optical density , one can solve the gap equation analytically .",
    "@xcite    by taking into account the density equation  , the critical temperature can be expressed as a function of the excitation density rather than as a function of the chemical potential . in the standard bcs theory",
    "there is no modulation of the interaction strength and therefore no difference between optical density @xmath146 and density of states @xmath66 . in our system instead one has to introduce separately both quantities , and further a realistic description of the dos is required in order to measure the density in physical units . in previous treatments ,",
    "@xcite where the dos has been attributed an arbitrary gaussian - like shape ( and moreover where the coupling strength was kept fixed ) , the density was measured in arbitrary units .",
    "note however that , the fact that the density of states asymptotes to a constant at large densities , and the presence of those exciton states that couple only weakly to light , is responsible only for the asymptotic form of the phase boundary at large densities ( well beyond the range shown in fig .

    "[ fig : criti ] clearly shows .",
    "this dependence is easy to understand in the extremely low density limit , where the critical temperature varies linearly with density , and is inversely proportional to the polariton mass : by increasing the detuning , the polariton mass also increases .",

    "section  [ sec : rrsca ] is then dedicated to rrs , for which we will see that the off - diagonal terms are necessary in order to describe the scattering of an incident photon ( via the excitonic component of the microcavity polariton mode ) into directions other than its original direction .",

    "finally , we wish to observe that there is a distinction between coulomb and saturation effects : coulomb interactions result in a blue - shift of both the lp and up , while saturation leads to a blue - shift of the lp and a red shift of the up , i.e. a collapse of the rabi splitting .",

    "however , as discussed earlier , in the presence of a condensate , the normal modes supported are no longer the lp and up , but instead the new bogoliubov - like quasi - modes .    the decay of spectral weight associated with modes far below the chemical potential , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spect ] still applies ( this can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrsca ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : spwei ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : plumi ] ) .",
    "however , since the energy of the rrs signal is controlled by the energy of the incident photon , it is possible to study modes far above the chemical potential , which would have negligible equilibrium occupation , and thus negligible weight in the pl signal .",
    "both for this reason , and because of the ability to discriminate between the coherent rrs signal and inchoherent photoluminescence , rrs provides a very powerful tool to study the interesting properties of condensed polariton systems .",
    "in this paper we have analysed and compared different optical responses of a condensate of microcavity polaritons .",
    "one of the conclusions of this work is that , compared to photoluminescence studies , the energy and momentum resolved resonant rayleigh scattering spectra provides many advantages in probing a condensed phase and in studying the associated coherent excitation spectrum . in particular ,",
    "resonant rayleigh scattering , by collecting the signal at a different angle from that at which the system is probed , allows one to look directly at characteristic features of the condensed phase excitation spectrum .",
    "such features , like the goldstone modes both above and below the chemical potential , are weak in photoluminescence emission and are likely to be masked by the strong emission from the condensate in the lowest momentum state . in contrast , rayleigh scattering ,",
    "being coherent with the probe , can be distinguished from condensate emission .",
    "one can ask why the accurate description of excitonic disorder considered in this paper is necessary , when the microcavity photon introduces a long length scale which averages over disorder . one might also compare this system with other excitonic systems , such as double quantum wells ,  @xcite where high density of dipole - dipole interacting excitons quickly screens the disorder .",
    "@xcite the answer to this question is that the large ratio of exciton to photon mass means firstly that exciton density required for condensation in microcavities is far less than in double quantum wells ; and secondly that those exciton states involved in forming the thermally occupied polariton modes are strongly localised exciton states ( i.e. influenced by disorder beyond born approximation ) .",
    "one of the consequences of an accurate treatment of disorder in microcavities is that the blue - shift of the lower polaritons due to saturation effects depends on a length scale characteristic of disorder and temperature , which can be much larger than the bohr radius , this length playing an equivalent role in the clean system .",
    "this effect can be important in determining the polariton densities from the measured blue - shift in current experiments .",
    "an important consequence of disorder is that the exciton - light coupling strength is characterised by a full distribution . in the non - condensed phase",
    ", the optical density alone determines the photoluminescence response , while for resonant rayleigh scattering the averaged fourth power of the oscillator strength is required .",
    "however , in the condensed phase one has to consider the entire distribution for each exciton energy . for energies close to and above the band edge , there is always a non - vanishing probability of an arbitrarily small oscillator strength .",
    "for this reason , in contrast to examples like bcs superconductivity , one can show that the quasi - particle spectrum does not have a hard gap .    in conclusion , we have considered how an accurate treatment of disorder on the single - particle excitonic level , when elevated to the many body problem of interacting microcavity polaritons , leads to a variety of interesting features in various optical responses and probes of the condensed phase .",

    "in this appendix we show how the coherent nature of the resonant rayleigh signal allows a weak coherent probe to be detected in the presence of strong incoherent photoluminescence .",
    "the rayleigh scattering probe is a perturbation , @xmath236 , which in the rotating wave approximation may be written as : @xmath237 this describes a probe at wavevector @xmath30 , frequency @xmath238 , of strength @xmath239 .",
    "the rrs signal is the coherent scattering of this probe to other wavevectors . to isolate the part of the emission that is coherent with the probe",
    ", one may use a homodyne measurement , interfering the emission with part of the probe signal .",
    "this corresponds to measuring the spectrally resolved emission intensity : @xmath240 where @xmath241 \\left[\\hat{\\psi}^{}_{{\\mathbf q}}(0 ) +    a_1e^{i\\phi } \\right ] |n\\rangle \\ ; , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and where @xmath242 is the strength of the homodyne mixing , and @xmath243 is a phase delay introduced between the probe and the homodyne signal .",
    "the states @xmath244 are the eigenstates of the system without the probe , given by @xmath245 ; @xmath246 is the free energy , for normalization .",
    "the principle of phase sensitive detection is to vary the phase delay , and to extract the part of @xmath247 which depends on this phase delay .",
    "since the background pl does not depend on the phase delay , this allows one to separate a small but phase dependent signal from a strong but phase independent background .",
