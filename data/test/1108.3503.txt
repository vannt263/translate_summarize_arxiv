    "time lags between x - ray variations in different energy bands have been measured in a number of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; e.g. vaughan et al . 2003 ; mchardy et al . 2004 ; arvalo et al . 2006 ; fabian et al .",

    "the lags are both fourier - frequency and energy dependent .    soft - to - hard lags ( i.e. hard - band variations lagging soft - band variations , conventionally having positive sign ) are usually detected at relatively low frequencies ( below the psd high frequency break ) , their magnitudes increasing with the energy separation between the bands , with an approximately log - linear trend ( e.g. arvalo et al .",
    "interestingly , the same behaviour is observed in many black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrb ; e.g. nowak et al .",
    "1999 , miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 , 1991 ) , thus supporting the idea that agn are the scaled - up counter parts of smaller size black hole systems . in this scenario the main differences in timing properties would depend on the mass of the accreting object ( e.g. mchardy et al . 2006 ; krding et al .",
    "2007 ) .    physical interpretations for the hard lags usually involve either comptonization in an optically thin corona ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ) or propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations in the disc ( kotov et al .",
    "2001 and arvalo & uttley 2006 ) .    the recent detection of a hard - to - soft high frequency time lag ( i.e. soft - band variations lagging hard - band ones at high frequency , conventionally having a negative sign ) in the x - ray data of 1h 0707 - 495 , adds further complexity to the lag behaviour , revealing the presence of a distinct component , interpreted by zoghbi et al .",

    "the presence of three main spectral components is inferred : a primary power law dominating the hard x - ray spectrum , a secondary soft component producing the excess observed at energies below @xmath61 kev , and one or more absorption systems , whose main spectral contribution falls at energies between 0.72 kev .",
    "the latter component is clearly visible from a comparison of the 2001 and 2004 spectra , whereby the primary continuum appears unchanged , leading pounds & reeves ( 2007 ) to interprete the decrease in 0.72 kev flux during the 2001 observation as due to an increase in absorption covering fraction and/or column density .    in the timing analysis",
    "described in this letter we first excluded the absorbed part of the spectrum , in order to isolate the contributions from the main hard ( 210 kev ) and soft ( 0.30.7 kev ) continuum components and study their temporal correlations .",

    "the psd is well described by a simple power law component with spectral index @xmath61.94 ( usually referred to as `` red noise '' ) , representing the source intrinsic variability power , and dominating at @xmath8hz , plus a constant component ( also referred to as `` white noise '' ) resulting from the uncertainty in the measured count rate . given the estimated mass for this object ( @xmath9m@xmath3 , e.g. kaspi et al .",

    "the frequencies are binned multiplicatively in steps of @xmath15 .",
    "we use the convention that negative lags identify a delayed response of the soft component to the hard one .",
    "negative lags are observed in each of the three observations of pg 1211 + 143 and in the combined 2007a and 2007b data .",
    "the lags appear in the low fourier - frequency components , i.e. @xmath16 67@xmath17 hz .",

    "the grey diamonds represent the 1@xmath20 confidence intervals from simulations of coherent lightcurves . ]",
    "a necessary condition for the lags to be real is that the light curves must show some level of coherence .",
    "coherence is a measure of the degree of linear correlation between two time series .",
    "we computed the coherence function , using the prescription by vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) .",
    "the result of coherence computation is shown in fig .",
    "[ coher ] .",
    "the apparently low degree of coherence measured in pg 1211 + 143 light curves seems consistent with observations of other agn , whereby the coherence has been found to decrease as the separation between the energy bands increases ( e.g. arvalo et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the plots we did not apply any correction for the poisson noise term in the cross spectrum , since the conditions given by vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) for the correction formula ( equation 8) to be applicable are not satisfied , due to the fact that the measured coherence is low .",
    "hence , we checked the coherence significance and the effects of poisson noise using montecarlo simulations .    to establish",
    "whether the observed degree of coherence is significantly different from the zero - coherence level , we simulated 1000 incoherent ( i.e. uncorrelated ) pairs of light curves , using the timmer & knig ( 1995 ) algorithm , and measured their coherence functions .",
    "the incoherence of the simulated pairs is ensured by considering different realizations from the same underlying psd ( which resembles the red - noise measured one , ",
    "[ psdsec ] , with spectral index 1.9 ) .",
    "we added gaussians  with variance equal to the square of the observed count rate errors  to each of the simulated light curves to account for the same level of poisson noise as observed in pg 1211 + 143 soft and hard time series . for each frequency bin we measured the @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath18 , and @xmath19 spread in the distribution of simulated coherences .",
    "the resulting contour plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ coher ] .",
    "the lowest frequency bin in the plots includes the frequency range where negative lags are observed . as a result",
    "the measured coherence is significantly different ( at more than @xmath22 ) from the value expected from incoherent light curves . only during the 2004 observation",
    "does this significance decrease to @xmath18 , probably because of the lower variability level which characterizes this observation , and the presence of gaps in the light curves , which contribute to reduce the coherence level .",
    "finally , we checked whether the coherence value is intrinsically low ( @xmath23 ) or whether it is decreased by the non - corrected poisson noise contribution . in this",
    "regard we simulated 1000 coherent light curve pairs and computed the mean of the distribution of coherences  measured including the poisson noise term in the cross spectrum  and its @xmath21 scatter . the result ( see fig .",
    "[ coher ] ) demonstrates that only the 2001 observation has an intrinsically low degree of coherence in the lowest frequency bin , while the 2007 observations are consistent with unity - coherence . again",
    "the observation 2004 does not allow strong conclusions to be drawn . as pointed out in ",
    "[ sec : lightcurves ] , the 2001 spectrum is characterized by the presence of a strong absorption component .",
    "this has the effect of decreasing the coherence level since the absorption system acts as a non - linear filter of the primary radiation .",
    "it is worth noting that in all the observations the coherence drops at frequencies @xmath24hz because the uncorrelated poisson component becomes dominant .",
    "the lag error bars in fig .",
    "[ tlag_vs_freq ] are calculated using equation ( 16 ) in nowak et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . to check",
    "whether they are representative of the lag significance we adopted the following approach .",
    "we simulated 1000 pairs of correlated light curves with a constant time lag between them .",
    "the test has been done on the 2001 and 2007a data , being the longest , continuous observations , and representative of the two flux levels of the source .",
    "a range of time lag values has been checked so as to better resemble the observed negative lags in the data . for each frequency",
    "the mean of the simulated lag distribution , and the @xmath21 and @xmath18 spreads have been computed , and displayed in fig .",
    "[ lag_cont ] as contour plots overplotted on real data .",
    "the contours confirm that the error bars used in the data are consistent with the @xmath21 dispersion in the simulated lags distribution .",
    "this also demonstrates that the measured lag can be well modelled by a constant lag over the entire sampled frequency range , with magnitude 650740 sec ( after correction for time dilation , @xmath25 , effects ) .",
    "the fact that the lag intrinsic magnitude is slightly higher than the observed one ( as seen in the plots ) is due to a red noise leak effect .",
    "indeed , a constant time lag ",
    "@xmath14  implies that the phase lag at each fourier frequency is proportional to the frequency itself , with the lower frequencies showing smaller phase lags .",
    "however , this being a time series of finite length , part of the signal from the lower frequency components of the cross spectrum will leak into the higher frequency components .",
    "the result is to add a smaller phase component to the cross - spectrum , i.e. a smaller time lag , than the true value for each frequency .",
    "it is worth noting that the lag positive values between frequencies 0.51@xmath26 hz are due to the phase changing its sign when it jumps from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ( see nowak et al .",
    "1999 for details ) .",
    "this is also the reason why the lag tends to zero at high frequencies .",
    "moreover , the lag appears stable over long time - scales ( of the order of years ) since even the 2004 and 2007a+b lag profiles ( fig .",
    "[ tlag_vs_freq ] ) are consistent with the same constant lag magnitude and trend , further increasing the global significance of the detection .      to study the energy dependence of the detected time - lags over the whole energy range , @xmath29 kev , we calculated their energy spectra .",
    "the spectra are obtained by computing time lags in fourier frequency space , between one fixed reference band and a number of adjacent energy channels , and averaging the resulting lags over the frequency interval of interest . in the present case",
    "the chosen reference band is the soft 0.30.7 kev band .",
    "the choice of the adjacent energy channels is arbitrary , but they need widths @xmath300.30.6 to statistically ensure that the variability power is above the noise level over the frequency range of interest .",
    "the integrated frequency interval includes the detected negative lags , i.e. @xmath31 16@xmath17 hz . the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ tlag_vs_e ] , where all the lag values are shifted so that the most negative lag corresponds to zero , and the corresponding energy band becomes the reference .",
    "we note that the lag - energy spectra are similar in the 2001 and 2004 observations , while a slightly different trend is observed during the 2007 observations .",
    "the first two observations are consistent with a soft lag appearing between the middle energy band , 26 kev , and the soft 0.32 kev band .",
    "the 2007 observations , on the other hand , show a soft lag over the entire 0.310 kev band , characterized by an increase in magnitude towards lower energies .",

    "the lag is calculated with the energy band 0.30.7 kev as the reference band and then shifted so that the minimum lag corresponds to zero . ]",
    "the analysis of frequency- and energy - dependent time lags in the four xmm-_newton _ archived observations ( 2001 , 2004 , 2007a , and 2007b observations ) of the nearby quasar pg 1211 + 143 has been presented . in the timing analysis we first considered only the soft band 0.30.7 kev , dominated by a strong soft excess , and the hard band 210 kev , dominated by the power law , to avoid the range of energies strongly affected by absorption . from the measured coherence",
    "we infer that the variability registered in the two bands on fourier - frequencies of @xmath32 hz is characterized by a certain degree of linear correlation ( from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ) , pointing at the presence of either one unique component extending over the whole 0.310 kev energy range , or two distinct soft and hard correlated components . in both cases",
    "the coherent variations are diluted by incoherent variability , possibly ascribable to the absorption component .",
    "we note that the observation with stronger absorption , i.e. 2001 , has lower coherence ( @xmath35 compared with @xmath36 ) .",
    "the coherent variations produce the soft lag , detected in the low frequency ( @xmath37 56@xmath17 hz ) regime during each observation .",
    "the lag is consistent with being constant over a large range of frequencies , with a magnitude of @xmath38 sec .",
    "we can not infer whether the lag extends to higher and lower frequencies since at @xmath24 hz the power spectrum is dominated by the white noise component , while the lower frequency part is limited by the duration and number / sampling of the observations .",
    "it is worth noting that positive hard lags are usually observed at low frequencies in seyfert galaxies ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "however , by rescaling their observed frequencies for the mass of pg 1211 + 143 they should appear below the range of frequencies probed by the current data .",
    "we finally checked whether the low frequency lag shows some energy dependence , finding two distinct trends appearing during the two different flux levels of the source . in the lower flux 2001 and 2004 observations",
    "the hard band leading the soft is @xmath39 kev . on the other hand",
    "the 2007 observations are characterized by a soft lag over all the sampled energy channels .",
    "the leading energy band is at high energies and the lag magnitude increases with decreasing energy .",
    "the measured soft lag allows us to derive an estimate on the source and reprocessing regions geometry and distance , once the mass of the central object is known .",
    "the mass of pg 1211 + 143 has been estimated via reverberation mapping of the balmer lines by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , @xmath40 , and revised by peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath41 .",
    "hereafter the two estimates , that differ by about one order of magnitude , will be adopted as lower and upper limits to the mass of pg 1211 + 143 .    in a reverberation scenario ,",
    "the time lag we measured implies an upper limit on the primary - to - reprocessed emission regions distance of @xmath42 cm , which corresponds to a few - to - tens @xmath43 .",
    "detection of a soft lag has been previously reported by fabian et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and zoghbi et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) in the nlsy1 galaxy 1h0707 - 495 ( @xmath44 , zhou & wang 2005 ) .",
    "the lag was interpreted as a reverberation signature of the reflecting material in the inner regions of the accretion disc , and it was observed in the high frequency range @xmath45hz .",
    "characteristic time - scales of an accreting system are expected to scale - up with the mass of the central object ( e.g. mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ; krding et al 2007 ) .",
    "pg 1211 + 143 has an estimated black hole mass about ten - to - hundred times larger than 1h0707 - 495 , which in turn implies that both the observed frequency of the lag and the lag magnitude should differ by a factor @xmath46 .",
    "as expected , the rescaled lag frequencies ( @xmath47 hz ) and magnitude ( @xmath48 sec ) of 1h 0707 - 495 yield values consistent with results found in pg 1211 + 143 .",
    "these results support the idea that the same underlying physical mechanism is at work in both the sources , with the measured negative lag marking some characteristic time - scale of the system .    nevertheless , the lag energy spectra show a puzzling behaviour which must be taken into account in discussing possible models . while the lower flux 2001 and 2004 spectra closely match the soft lag spectrum in 1h0707 - 495 , and so are roughly consistent with disc reverberation ( zoghbi et al .",
    "2011 ) , the marginally different 2007 lag energy trend can not be easily reconciled with this scenario .    in this regard",
    "the time lag might be intrinsic to the source involving either a disk - corona feedback mechanism ( malzac & jourdain 2000 ) , which is able to gradually soften the spectrum , or the response of a secondary , lower temperature comptonization gas layer , producing the soft excess .      another possibility could be that the observed lag is produced far away from the central regions , but close to the line of sight , e.g. in the absorbing gas phase observed in the x - ray spectra of pg 1211 + 143 . in this case , taking the estimate given by blustin et al .",

    "the lag should be produced by the gas re - emitted / scattered component of a disc wind ( e.g. miller et al .",

    "2008 , tombesi et al .",
    "such a variable wind structure would , therefore hardly reconcile with the apparently constant lag we observe in all the observations .",
    "moreover , the low opening angle as deduced from the lag , and the fact that the lag itself appears to be constant over a broad frequency range would imply a highly collimated structure along the line of sight which seems difficult to reproduce in wind models .",

    "<S> soft energy band ( 0.3 - 0.7 kev ) lags are detected over all the four observations , in the frequency range @xmath0 hz , where hard lags , similar to those observed in black hole x - ray binaries , are usually detected in smaller mass agn . the lag magnitude is energy - dependent , showing two distinct trends apparently connectable to the two flux levels at which the source is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the results are discussed in the context of disk- and/or corona - reprocessing scenarios , and of disk wind models . </S>",
    "<S> similarities with the high - frequency negative lag of 1h 0707 - 495 are highlighted , and , if confirmed , they would support the hypothesis that the lag in pg 1211 + 143 represents the signature of the same underlying mechanism , whose temporal characteristics scale with the mass of the central object .    </S>",
