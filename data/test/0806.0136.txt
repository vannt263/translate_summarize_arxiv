    "the interest in polymer adsorption reflects both its practical importance@xcite and the associated theoretical challenges@xcite . within this domain the adsorption behavior of neutral water soluble polymers ( nwsp ) , exemplified by polyethylene oxide ( peo ) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone ( pvp)@xcite , occupies a special position . on the applied side",
    "this is because of their importance in the formulation of water - based colloidal solutions@xcite of practical interest . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the adsorption of nwsp poses a distinctive problem : while nwsp such as peo are homopolymers comprising of chemically identical monomers , they are modeled as `` two - state polymers '' whose monomers interconvert between hydrophilic ( p ) and hydrophobic ( h ) states@xcite .",
    "these two - state models are invoked in order to rationalize a phase diagram exhibiting a closed insolubility loop , with both upper and lower critical solution temperatures , that is thought to characterize nwsp .",
    "the models differ with respect to the precise identification of the two interconverting states",
    ". nevertheless , within all of these models nwsp exhibit an annealed sequence of hp states with a temperature ( t ) dependent h / p ratio .",
    "the adsorption behavior of such _ annealed _ two - state polymers is expected to differ from that of homopolymers comprising of single monomer species and of _ quenched _ random copolymers with a fixed sequence and composition .",
    "thus far , it was investigated using a self consistent field theory @xcite of a laterally uniform adsorbed layer , comprising many adsorbed chains , in contact with a polymer solution . in the following we consider , in contrast , the adsorption transition of a single , terminally anchored , two - state polymer and compare it to the corresponding results for homopolymers @xcite and for quenched copolymers @xcite .",
    "in particular , we investigate the adsorption of a non - cooperative two - state polymer using monte carlo simulation supplemented by simple theory .",
    "our discussion is mostly concerned with swollen chains under good solvent conditions .",
    "simulation evidence suggests that the adsorption of both homopolymers and of quenched copolymers exhibits identical scaling behavior upon introduction of the appropriate effective adsorption energy per copolymer s monomer , @xmath0 .",
    "the cross - over exponent @xmath2 characterizing the second - order adsorption transition of these two systems is identical @xcite . with this in mind",
    "we expect similar behavior for the annealed two - state polymers .",
    "accordingly we first identify the @xmath0 for the annealed copolymers case and then analyze the simulation data assuming that such chains adsorb as homopolymers with @xmath0 specifying the monomer - surface interaction .",
    "as we shall see , this picture is consistent with the simulation results .",
    "in particular , it allows to collapse the simulation data concerning the number of adsorbed monomers @xmath3 onto universal curves and to reproduce the simulation results concerning the total @xmath4 fraction as well as the @xmath4 fraction in the bulk and at the surface .",
    "importantly , in distinction to quenched copolymers , the total @xmath4 fraction as well as the @xmath4 fraction in the bulk and at the surface are not fixed .",
    "these results are of interest from two points of view .",
    "first , they complement earlier results on the adsorption transition of homopolymers@xcite and quenched copolymers@xcite .",
    "second , they provide a starting point for the formulation of a phenomenological free energy description@xcite of the adsorption of nwsp modeled as two - state polymers .    in formulating the problem we aimed to capture the generic features common to the various two - state models .",
    "these differ with respect to the precise identification of the interconverting states : polar vs apolar@xcite , hydrated vs nonhydrated@xcite , or clustered vs nonclustered@xcite . with this in mind we focused on the simplest case where the monomers undergo a unimolecular hp interconversion . in the following we confront simple theory with off - lattice monte carlo simulations of the adsorption behavior of a single two - state polymer within this minimal model .",
    "there is no explicit solvent in the simulation and the monomers states are modeled as lennard - jones particles having identical collision diameters .",
    "the interactions between of the various monomer - monomer pairs are identical but the interaction parameters with the surface differ with the monomeric state . as a result",
    "the ph interconvesion at the surface and at the bulk are associated with different equilibrium constants ( figure 1 ) .",
    "our model is thus closest to the one proposed by karlstrm@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 of the two - state model is obtained in section ii using a partition function method similar to that of moghaddam and whittington@xcite as well as its free energy counterpart .",
    "the consequences for the scaling analysis and blob description are discussed in section iii . in section",
    "iv we present the details of the simulation model and the simulation results are discussed in section v.",
    "two methods can be used to identify @xmath5 the adsorption energy of an `` effective '' monomer at the surface . in one ,",
    "first used by moghaddam and whittington to obtain bounds for quenched copolymers @xcite , @xmath0 is obtained upon recasting the annealed copolymer partition function into a homopolymer - like form containing factors of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "similarly , it is possible to consider the free energy of an annealed copolymer and recognize @xmath0 in a term of the form @xmath8 .",

    "@xmath0 varies with the @xmath249 ratio which , in contrast to the quenched case , depends on the temperature , the adsorption energies and the bulk standard chemical potentials .",
    "this picture allows to calculate the number of adsorbed monomers @xmath3 , the @xmath249 ratio in the bulk and at the surface as well as the overall @xmath249 ratio .",

    "simulation of homopolymer chains suggest that the form of the wall - monomer potential does not affect @xmath2 and the scaling behavior of @xmath251 since annealed copolymers adsorb as homopolymers characterized by @xmath0 one expects similar insensitivity to the details of the potential .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath249 ratio is sensitive to the range of the wall potential . both features are apparent from our results concerning the adsorption of rw annealed copolymers subject to a 10 - 4 wall potential .",
    "as noted earlier , our analysis utilizes a simplified version of the karlstrm model .",
    "in contrast to this model all monomer - monomer interactions are identical .",
    "new features may well occur upon introducing attraction between hydrophobic h monomers . in the case of free chain in the bulk",
    "such interaction can lead to phase separation@xcite and to polymer collapse@xcite .",
    "the preferential adsorption of h monomers together with hh attraction may lead to adsorption induced collapse .",
    "our discussion thus far focused on the comparison between simulation results of annealed and quenched copolymers .",
    "the comparison of the experimental situation brings up a second issue .",
    "the experimental realization of quenched copolymers is clear and studying the adsorption of the corresponding homopolymers allows to deduce the adsorption energies of the different monomers involved .",
    "the situation is more difficult in the case of annealed copolymer as encountered in the modeling of nwsp .",
    "the corresponding one state homopolymers do not exist .",
    "furthermore , direct experimental evidence concerning the molecular identity of the interconverting states is yet to emerge . as a result",
    "the interaction parameters are obtained indirectly by model dependent fitting of experimental data . with this in mind",
    "it is important to recall the experimental evidence for two - state models .",
    "two observations are of special interest .",
    "one is their ability to predict the qualitative features of the phase diagram and fit experimentally observed phase boundaries@xcite .",
    "the second concerns the stretching of peo chains in atomic force microscopy experiments .",
    "this reveals that different force laws characterize the strong stretching regime in water and in hexadecane .",
    "in particular , the chain extension in water exhibits a plateau characteristic of two - state polymers@xcite .",
    "n.y . benefited from fellowship no .",

    "part of the numerical calculations in this work was carried out on altix3700 bx2 at yitp in kyoto university .",
    "our discussion focused on the mw annealed approximation because of its simplicity and proven utility in the analysis of simulation data @xcite .",
    "we should add that the more general morita approximation @xcite is also obtainable from equation ( [ ii3 ] ) upon choosing @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 , @xmath255 ."
