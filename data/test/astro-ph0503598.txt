    "in recent years great effort has been devoted to calibrating the near - infrared ( nir ) period - luminosity ( pl ) relationship of cepheids .",
    "there are numerous advantages of observing cepheids in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 bands compared to optical observations .",
    "first , the dust extinction is an order of magnitude lower than in the visual bandpasses .",
    "second , the spread around the mean pl relation is smaller .",
    "third , metallicity effects on the pl relation are expected to decrease in amplitude with increasing wavelength .",
    "the largest difficulty in achieving good - quality nir pl diagrams for cepheids is the necessity of obtaining well - covered light curves to compute the mean magnitudes .",
    "however , the techniques of observations in nir passbands are more time - consuming , the sizes of nir detectors are in general significantly smaller than the optical detectors , and nir imagers are not as widely available on telescopes and are frequently `` bright time '' instruments . therefore , usually only one or two random - phase observations of cepheids in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 bands are available .",
    "it is then necessary to recover the mean magnitudes of the cepheids from few - epoch data . while such corrections to derive the mean magnitudes are usually not the dominant remaining errors for the distance determination of galaxies from cepheids , it is still clearly desirable to keep these errors as low as possible .",
    "one solution that can substitute for deriving mean magnitudes from complete light curves is an estimation of the average brightness by template - fitting procedures .",
    "a number of methods have been applied to reconstruct the light curves of cepheids in various passbands .",
    "historically , the first method of recovering mean @xmath5 magnitudes from single - phase observations was described by @xcite .",
    "they suggested choosing 1 of 23 galactic cepheid light curves ( with a period similar to the considered variable ) , scaling its amplitude , and using it as a template light curve to estimate the mean magnitude .",
    "@xcite derived the @xmath3 and @xmath4-band light curves of cepheids in ic  1613 by scaling the amplitudes and shifting phases of the @xmath6-band light curves .",
    "the adopted amplitude ratios and phase lags between photometric bandpasses were calculated using 20 classical galactic cepheids .",
    "freedman s solution assumed that the shapes of the light curves in the various bandpasses are the same , differing only in amplitude and phase .",
    "this assumption works well in transformations between light curves in the optical part of the spectrum , but is useless when transforming the optical to nir light curves , because the shapes of the light curves are completely different .",
    "a series of @xmath3 and @xmath4-band template light curves were constructed by @xcite .",
    "he used more than 100 galactic and lmc cepheids to derive mean fourier coefficients of their light curves for a range of periods .",
    "the templates were then used to recover mean magnitudes of cepheids from a sparsely data observed by the _ hubble space telescope _ @xcite .    another solution to this problem",
    "was introduced by @xcite , who determined the correction curves to transfer @xmath3 to @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4-band light curves of cepheids .",
    "they used a rather small sample ( six ) of galactic cepheids .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not assume fixed shapes of the template light curves .",
    "@xcite used statistical relations between fourier amplitudes and phases of @xmath3 and @xmath4-band light curves ( so - called fourier interrelations ) to reconstruct the latter .",
    "this method works properly when accurate measurements of the fourier coefficients to the fourth order are available ; i.e. , when good quality well - covered @xmath3-band light curves are available .    recently , @xcite converted random - phase @xmath5 measurements to mean magnitudes , computing the correction functions for each bandpass .",
    "they used more than 2000 cepheids from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) to derive the differences between the observed magnitudes of individual variables and those derived from fitted pl relations .",
    "the obtained residuals were then fitted by a function depending on the @xmath3 phase .",
    "the weakest point of this method is that it does not take into account the different amplitudes of individual cepheids .",
    "@xcite estimated the errors of their method as 0.05 mag .",
    "similar uncertainties for the estimation of mean @xmath5 magnitudes were obtained by the authors of the other algorithms described above .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a technique of deriving mean nir magnitudes of fundamental - mode cepheids using one random - phase measurement in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 bands and the complete light curves observed in @xmath3 or @xmath4 bands .",
    "our method is based on the template light curves in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands obtained from 61 fundamental - mode cepheids from the milky way and the lmc .",
    "the amplitudes of our templates depend on the amplitudes in the visual passbands ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 bandpasses ) and on the periods of the stars .",
    "the phase lags between visual and nir light curves are constant in our algorithm .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the development of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 template light curves , in section 3 we describe the practical application of the method of deriving mean magnitudes from single - epoch points , in section 4 the error analysis is presented , and section 5 contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "we started our analysis by selecting the most numerous possible sample of fundamental - mode cepheids with well - covered light curves in the nir and visual passbands .",
    "we used @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2-band observations from two sources : @xcite for galactic cepheids and @xcite for the lmc cepheids .",
    "the former provide photometry in the carter system , while the latter use @xmath8 magnitudes in the lco system .",
    "since in the ongoing araucaria project @xcite we calibrated our nir observations of cepheids in several nearby galaxies onto the ukirt system , we used carpenter s ( 2001 ) transformation equations between nir photometric systems to transform the photometry from both sources to this system .",
    "however , the photometric system used in our analysis is not a crucial point , because the transformation formulae between the systems depend only weakly on color , so they do not significantly influence the shapes and amplitudes of the light curves .    for the selected cepheids , we tried to find as many johnson @xmath3 and cousin @xmath4-band observations in the literature as possible , to obtain complete light curves in these bands",
    "ultimately , our list included 30 fundamental - mode cepheids from the galaxy and 31 stars from the lmc .",
    "1 contains the full list of objects .",
    "the last column presents information about the sources of the adopted data .",
    "we collected @xmath3 and @xmath4 photometric data covering a time span of several to more than 20 years .",
    "we used these data to correct the pulsational periods of our sample cepheids . in most cases the periods",
    "were measured with an accuracy better than @xmath9 .",
    "we provide the improved periods in tab .  1 .",
    "precisely determined periods are necessary to derive correct phase shifts between optical and nir points .",
    "a seventh - order fourier series was then fitted to each @xmath3 and @xmath4 light curve .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 light curves were fitted by a fifth - order fourier expansion . in this way , we obtained the basic parameters of the selected cepheids : magnitudes , amplitudes , and time of the maximum and minimum brightness . in the next part of this section , we present the development of the @xmath5 templates relative to @xmath3-band light curves .",
    "the analysis of the nir photometry relative to the @xmath4 bandpass was performed in the same manner .    in fig",
    ".  1 we present the phase lags of @xmath5 light curves relative to the @xmath3-band data plotted against the @xmath10 .",
    "note that the difference of phases depends very weakly , if at all , on period . in the further analysis",
    ", we assumed that the phase lag between visual and nir light curves does not depend on the periods of the cepheids .",
    "similarly , we tested a relationship between the amplitude ratios and the periods .",
    "2 presents @xmath11 versus @xmath10 diagrams ( @xmath12 ) . in each of the three panels , it is possible to notice that the amplitude ratios are smaller for the short - period cepheids and larger for long - period cepheids . in our algorithm , we approximated the amplitude ratios by constant values different for shorter and longer periods of variability .",
    "we adopted the same amplitude ratios for galactic and lmc cepheids , but a different period dividing up the values .",
    "for the galactic cepheids , we adopted @xmath13 , while for the lmc we used @xmath14 .",
    "the difference in the amplitude ratios between galactic and lmc cepheids agrees with the results of @xcite , who found statistically significant differences in the amplitudes between galactic , lmc , and smc cepheids in the period range @xmath15 .    tab .  2 contains the adopted amplitude ratios for the shorter and longer period cepheids .",
    "although the drop of the amplitude ratios around @xmath16 ( @xmath17 for the lmc cepheids ) is clearly visible in fig .  2 , the difference between shorter and longer period stars is comparable to the scatter of the points .",
    "therefore , the sudden adopted change of the amplitude ratio does not have a significant influence on the final results .",
    "one can determine and adopt another relationship of the amplitude ratios and periods .",
    "in particular , we call attention to cepheids with periods longer than 100 days , for which the ratios of the nir and @xmath3 amplitudes are significantly larger than for other cepheids .    in the next stage of our procedure , we prepared the normalized @xmath5 light curves . for each observing point",
    "we calculated the phase from maximum brightness in the @xmath3 bandpass ; i.e. , @xmath18    the magnitudes were transformed in such a way that the mean magnitude of every light curve was 0 and the amplitude was equal to 1 ; e.g. , for @xmath2-band points : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the amplitude of variability and @xmath21 is a magnitude - averaged mean brightness .",
    "all points of all light curves normalized in that manner are plotted together in fig .",
    "the left panels show @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 data of the galactic cepheids , while the right panels contain lmc data .",
    "note that the normalized light curves are very homogeneous .",
    "the scatter of the points for the lmc cepheids is larger than that obtained for the galactic variables , which is an effect of larger measurement errors for the fainter lmc objects , but the shapes of the light curves in both environments are very similar .",
    "this feature can be used to construct nir template cepheid light curves .",
    "the last step of our analysis was an approximation of the co - added ( galactic and lmc cepheids ) normalized light curves using a fourier series of seventh order : @xmath22\\ ] ] which were done separately for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 data .",
    "the fourier coefficients , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are presented in tab .",
    "before starting to derive the mean @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath27 magnitudes of a cepheid , one should make sure that its period is sufficiently well determined to accurately calculate the ephemeris phase at the individual nir observations . if a precise period and well - covered light curves in @xmath3 or @xmath4 of a fundamental - mode cepheid are available , one can easily estimate its @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 using a single - epoch measurement in these filters .",
    "the procedure is as follows .    1 .",
    "determine amplitudes in the visual passbands @xmath28 or @xmath29 , defined as the differences between the maximum and the minimum magnitude . then using the amplitude ratios listed in tab .  2 , estimate the amplitude in the appropriate nir bands . 2 .",
    "measure the epochs of maximum brightness in @xmath3 or @xmath4 bandpasses and calculate the appropriate phases of the nir measurement points ( equation  1 ) .",
    "3 .   calculate the value of the template light curve @xmath30 for a given phase using equation  3 and the fourier coefficients listed in tab .",
    "the final estimation of the mean magnitudes can be obtained from the formulae @xmath31    in that manner we can estimate the magnitude - averaged luminosity of the cepheids .",
    "however , in many cases the intensity - averaged mean magnitudes are needed . to derive nir intensity",
    "means expressed in magnitudes ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) , we suggest using corrections to the magnitude - averaged magnitudes . for each fundamental - mode cepheid in our sample , we determined mean nir magnitudes using both methods .",
    "4 shows the differences between both mean magnitudes versus the amplitude in an appropriate bandpass .",
    "note that the difference between magnitude - averaged and intensity - averaged mean magnitudes clearly depends on the amplitude of variability , but stays small ( @xmath35 mag ) even for the largest amplitudes .",
    "it is possible to easily derive intensity - averaged mean magnitudes using the following relationships , approximated by quadratic functions : @xmath36    to test our algorithm on independent data , we applied it to single - epoch @xmath5 measurements of cepheids in the lmc from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog .",
    "we used the ogle - ii catalog of cepheids in the lmc @xcite to select fundamental - mode cepheids , and match them with sources from the 2mass catalog .",
    "we found 458 counterparts closer than @xmath37 from the position of the ogle cepheids .",
    "we then plotted single - epoch @xmath5 measurements in the pl diagram and removed from our sample stars that were evidently blended in the 2mass database .",
    "we recognized as blends objects deviating from the mean pl relationship by more than @xmath38 .",
    "this seems a reasonable assumption , given the crowding conditions in the lmc and the relatively large @xmath37 size of the pixels of the 2mass data , which increases the number of unresolved cepheids compared to the optical ogle images , which were taken at pixel scales of @xmath39 per pixel .",
    "indeed , all the objects suspected of being blends in the 2mass data are cepheids lying close to the respective ridge lines in the optical @xmath40 pl relations .",
    "we selected a total of 422 stars .",
    "the 2mass photometry was transformed to the ukirt system using carpenter s ( 2001 ) formulae .    to derive mean @xmath5 magnitudes",
    ", we utilized the well - sampled ogle @xmath4-band light curves of the cepheids . for each object",
    ", we performed the procedure described above .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "the top panel shows the original single - epoch measurements , while the bottom panel presents the mean magnitudes derived from the application of our algorithm .",
    "the improvement is clearly visible to the naked eye , especially for longer period variables where measurement errors are smaller . for cepheids with @xmath41 days",
    "the scatter of the points after correction is reduced to half .",
    "an estimation of the errors of the derived mean magnitudes was conducted using the same galactic and lmc cepheids that served to calibrate the method .",
    "we used each single point of each @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 light curve to estimate the mean magnitudes , and we compared these values with the phase - averaged magnitudes obtained from an integration of the complete light curves . for each cepheid , we calculated the @xmath42 of the scatter of the estimated mean values around the `` real '' mean magnitudes .",
    "the data we obtained are presented in tab .  4 .    obviously , the errors determined in this way are not the intrinsic errors of our algorithm .",
    "the scatter of derived mean magnitudes also has other causes : photometric measurement errors of the points that were used to estimate the mean luminosity , uncertainty of the settled phases and amplitudes , and errors of the mean magnitudes used to compare our results .",
    "the standard errors in the individual measurements of the galactic cepheids were estimated to be about 0.01 mag @xcite .",
    "the typical uncertainty of the lmc data is between 0.02 and 0.05 mag @xcite .",
    "formal errors of amplitudes and mean magnitudes are equal to 0.010.03 mag .",
    "the uncertainty of the phase lags between optical and nir light curves is a function of the period errors and time span between observations in both bandpasses . in some cases the phase errors are as large as 0.05 .",
    "the quality of the final mean magnitudes strongly depends on the accuracy of the ephemeris phase determination .",
    "we checked that a 0.05 inaccuracy in the phase lags increases the scatter of the derived mean magnitudes by a factor 2 .",
    "as one can see in tab .  4 , the typical variance of the estimated mean magnitude is about 0.03 mag for galactic cepheids ( median values 0.035 , 0.029 and 0.027 mag for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , respectively ) and 0.05 mag for the lmc variables ( 0.056 , 0.046 , and 0.048 mag for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the larger scatter for the lmc cepheids is probably an effect of larger errors of individual measurements , compared to the galactic cepheid measurements of @xcite , and the added effect of crowding on the measurements . for several cepheids in both galaxies ,",
    "the scatter is significantly larger than typical .",
    "we found that most of these cases are caused by atypical amplitude ratios ( e.g. , for cepheids with @xmath43 days ) or phases lags between the @xmath3 and nir light curves . in this",
    "are also a number of cepheids with bumps in their light curves .",
    "finally , the intrinsic error of our method of deriving mean nir magnitudes of fundamental - mode cepheids can be conservatively estimated to be 0.03 mag .",
    "the errors can be larger when the light curves are bumpy or have atypical shapes , but the accuracy can be better than 0.03 mag for cepheids with typical light curves , when the phase lags are determined with high precision .",
    "obviously , the larger the number of isolated @xmath5 measurements , the better the accuracy of the final mean magnitude , because it can be averaged from several independent values .",
    "the application of template light curves is the most accurate method of estimating mean nir magnitudes of cepheid variables when the observed data have poor phase coverage .",
    "we show that it is possible to reconstruct the nir light curves if basic parameters of the optical light curves are available .",
    "the advantage of our method is that there is no need to determine the fourier coefficients for the template light curves , which for sparsely sampled light curves can not be measured accurately .",
    "obviously , the nir templates can also be used without knowledge of the @xmath3 or @xmath4 light curves . if several points in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 bands are available and the period of the given fundamental - mode cepheid is known , one can fit the proper amplitudes and phases using , for instance , the least - squares method .",
    "it is an alternative method of converting the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 magnitudes to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
