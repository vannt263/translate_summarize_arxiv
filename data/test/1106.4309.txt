    "gauge / gravity duality with non - relativistic scale invariance has drawn considerable interest in recent years .",

    "schrdinger symmetry is a scale invariant extension of the galiean symmetry by the particle number symmetry , anisotropic scale symmetry with dynamical exponent @xmath4 and special conformal symmetry .",
    "the geometry of @xcite realizes this symmetry of a qft in @xmath5 spacetime dimension as isometries of a @xmath6 dimensional spacetime of the following form has been studied in @xcite , prior to @xcite . ] : @xmath7\\ \\ , \\ \\",
    "\\ \\vec{x}\\in\\mathbb{r}^d\\ .\\ ] ] in particular , the shift symmetry of the coordinate @xmath8 realizes the particle number symmetry .",
    "there are many works on schrdinger solutions in string / m - theory , including @xcite , which also discuss schrdinger solutions with general dynamical exponent @xmath9 .",
    "see also many references below that we mention in more detailed contexts .",
    "@xmath10 dimensional non - relativistic cft duals of 5 dimensional schrdinger geometries ( which we call sch@xmath11 ) were studied in @xcite with string theory embedding , as deformations of @xmath12 dimensional relativistic field theories by irrelevant operators which partly break the 4 dimensional conformal symmetry .",
    "see @xcite for more discussions on the holography in this context .",
    "on the other hand , a very natural way of obtaining a non - relativistic theory is to start from a relativistic cft living in a spacetime with _ same dimension _ , and to obtain the non - relativistic theory in the ir after a suitable mass deformation and performing the standard non - relativistic limit of redefining the energy and discarding ` anti - particles . '",
    "indeed , it has been shown concretely that a class of @xmath10 dimensional mass - deformed cft gives a non - relativistic theory with schrdinger symmetry @xcite .",
    "contrary to the other realization obtained by starting from a relativistic cft in one higher dimension , the schrdinger symmetry can not be embedded into the conformal symmetry of the relativistic theory .",
    "it is thus interesting to see if there are mass - deformed cft s admitting gravity duals which show ` holographic rg flows ' from ads@xmath13 to sch@xmath14 .",
    "to sch@xmath14 will be clarified later , as the latter lacks @xmath15 dimensional poincare symmetry of ads@xmath13 .",
    "we shall obtain sch@xmath11 after combining an internal direction with four directions , performing the coordinate transformation ( [ coordinate - transform ] ) to have a time @xmath16 conjugate to the non - relativistic energy , and finally taking the scaling limit ( [ scaling ] ) . ] the case with @xmath17 will be our main interest in this paper , although similar studies could be done in other dimensions .",
    "in particular , @xcite discussed the non - relativistic superconformal field theory obtained by deforming the @xmath18 scft @xcite by a mass term preserving all poincare supersymmetries , considering a particular vacuum in which all scalar expectation values are zero .",
    "the classical lagrangian of this non - relativistic field theory preserves @xmath19 supercharges , including @xmath20 extra non - relativistic conformal supercharges .",
    "there have been some efforts to construct the gravity dual of this theory in the ir based on the geometric realization of schrdinger symmetry @xcite .",
    "none of them found it , at least with all @xmath19 killing spinors .",
    "soon it was argued @xcite with a witten index calculation that the corresponding field theory vacuum does not exist , at least in the subset of supersymmetric vacua .",
    "the gravity dual of this theory is still ill - understood to date .",
    "see more comments about it in the discussion .    in this paper",
    ", we find a very simple class of flow solutions from ads@xmath0 to sch@xmath11 after deforming a class of relativistic cft@xmath21 with a mass operator .",
    "the 3 dimensional relativistic cft@xmath21 can be regarded as those living on parallel m2-branes in m - theory .",
    "our construction is based on the relativistic uv cft dual to the so - called skew - whiffed @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes 7 dimensional sasaki - einstein manifold .",
    "the skew - whiffing in this context corresponds to changing the sign of m2-brane charge , generically breaking supersymmetry . for the particular case of @xmath24 ,",
    "maximal superconformal symmetry is preserved and the uv cft is relatively well understood . in this case , we explicitly identify the mass operator , which turns out to be non - supersymmetric and invariant under an @xmath25 subgroup of @xmath26 .",
    "our finding shows how schrdinger geometries can appear by deforming relativistic cft s by mass operators and taking the non - realtivistic limit .",
    "it could find applications in many different gauge / gravity dual models containing massive degrees only .",
    "we briefly comment on some possible applications in the discussion .",
    "the solution we consider in this paper can actually be understood as the zero - temperature black brane solution found and discussed in @xcite from 4 dimensional gauged supergravity .",
    "the 4 dimensional metric in the einstein frame in the ` ir regime ' ( with small @xmath27 ) is given by @xmath28 which has zero entropy .",
    "this type of geometry with poincare symmetry and broken ( isotropic ) scale invariance was considered in @xcite , and a similar system was considered in @xcite .",
    "this type of geometry is different from those considered in @xcite which have approximate lifshitz symmetry . from our model , it is clear that the broken isotropic scale invariance originates from the mass deformation of the uv cft .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we explain our ansatz and obtain the analytic solution in the ir in the small radius expansion .",
    "we explain the gravity dual operation of taking the non - relativistic limit of qft , the appearance of sch@xmath11 geometry , and the exact solution which interpolates our ir solution with asymptotic ads@xmath0 . in section 3",
    ", we explain the mass term of the dual field theory when the internal 7-manifold is @xmath29 or orbifolds thereof .",
    "section 4 concludes with discussions .",
    "we seek for flow solutions from @xmath22 to 5 dimensional schrdinger geometries in the consistent truncation ansatz discovered in @xcite .",
    "it will turn out that we can realize a schrdinger solution in the infrared if we advocate the so - called skew - whiffed truncation .",
    "this truncated theory contains an @xmath22 vacuum , generically with broken supersymmetry . for the special case of @xmath24 ,",
    "the @xmath30 vacuum is maximally supersymmetric . for the case with @xmath31 orbifold , the @xmath30 vacuum after orbifold is non - supersymmetric with skew - whiffing .",
    "the nature of the mass term driving the flow of our solution will be discussed in section 3 after studying the gravity solutions .",
    "the full solution is actually available in an analytic form @xcite , but to illustrate how the solution looks like and to explain why skew - whiffed setting is necessary to have nontrivial solutions , we explain some details of the derivation .    the consistent truncation ansatz of @xcite is @xmath32\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the khler 2-form of the khler - einstein base @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the reeb 1-form with @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are 1-form , 2-form , 3-form in 4 dimensions , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are real / complex scalars , respsectively .",
    "the truncation with @xmath43 contains supersymmetric and generically non - supersymmetric @xmath30 vacuum .",
    "the case with @xmath44 is the skew - whiffed truncation .",
    "we would like to study the flow solutions preserving the @xmath10 dimensional poincare symmetry on the m2-brane world - volume .",
    "this is because the flow itself after a mass deformation does not break poincare symmetry on the worldvolume .",
    "it is only the non - relativistic limit , discarding ` anti - particles ' after suitably redefining non - relativistic energy , which breaks it .",
    "we thus consider the poincare invariant ansatz @xmath45 from poincare symmetry , the gauge fields @xmath39 , @xmath46 are zero . at this stage , it appears that @xmath40 may be nonzero if proportional to the volume form @xmath47 . from the equations of motion and",
    "the bianchi identities for @xmath48 , one obtains @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the @xmath39 equation of motion on the second line , one should set @xmath51 .",
    "so either @xmath52 or @xmath40 should be vanishing .",
    "as we shall see later , nonzero @xmath52 is crucial to have a schrdinger solution in the ir , similar to those in @xcite .",
    "so we set @xmath53 .",
    "the field @xmath42 can always be consistently set to zero , which we do from now on .",
    "then , only the @xmath52 equation of motion ( third line ) remains nontrivial among the above equations .",
    "as we shall explain shortly , we want an ir solution with @xmath54 , @xmath55 as @xmath56 , to get 5 dimensional schrdinger solutions .",
    "it turns out that one can set @xmath57 , which is the value for the ads@xmath0 vacuum , all along the flow .",
    "we shall later explain that this is a consistent ansatz , which actually comes from the existence of a further consistent truncation found in @xcite .",
    "with @xmath58 , the 11 dimensional einstein equation becomes @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the last equation is the @xmath61 equation of motion .",
    "note that @xmath62 . with our 4 dimenisional metric ( [ 4d - metric ] ) , one obtains @xmath63 for @xmath64 , where prime denotes @xmath27 derivative .",
    "therefore , the two nontrivial components ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) of the einstein equations and the @xmath67 equations become @xmath68\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apparently , there are 5 equations for 3 functions @xmath69 .",
    "one more equation appears due to our poincare invariant ansatz with @xmath27 dependent functions only , and another one due to our ansatz @xmath58 .",
    "the former extra equation will be eliminated from the consistency of poincare invariant ansatz , and the second one from the consistency of @xmath57 ansatz .",
    "we first explain some structures of these equations .",
    "as briefly explained above , we want @xmath70 for some constant @xmath71 as @xmath56 . then the terms containing @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the first three equations all yield @xmath74 , which are of order @xmath75 . also , the last factors @xmath76 become very large due to @xmath77 , unless @xmath78 is small .",
    "especially , in the second equation , considering the signs of other terms , this term can not be canceled at all if it is indeed large .",
    "the only way to have the desired ir solution is to take @xmath79 with skew - whiffing and demand @xmath80 as @xmath56 . in section 3",
    ", we will also provide a group theoretical argument from uv perspective on why the desired flow solutions exist only with skew - whiffing in this truncation .",
    "firstly , the equation for @xmath61 becomes to @xmath81[e^v+(-1+h^2)e^{-v}]\\ .\\ ] ] this relates @xmath52 and @xmath82 in an algebraic manner .",
    "it will turn out that @xmath83 is the solution that we want .",
    "it is a special case of an algebraic relation found in the truncation of @xcite with @xmath84 .",
    "we are left with 4 equations for 2 variables @xmath85 .",
    "one can easily show that the @xmath52 equation is equivalent to the @xmath86 equation . to show this",
    ", we multiply @xmath52 to the last equation of ( [ 5-equations ] ) and obtain @xmath87\\ ] ] after inserting ( [ h - v ] ) . as",
    "the expression in the last parenthesis is the @xmath86 equation , the two equations are equivalent as long as @xmath88 . in our flow solution",
    ", @xmath52 will only be asymptotically zero in uv , where we can easily check separately that the uv fixed point solves all equations .",
    "so the last constraint will not obstruct the above elimination of one equation .",
    "so far , the three equations for the two variables @xmath85 ( with ( [ h - v ] ) assumed ) are @xmath89 where the last equation may be replaced by @xmath90\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath91 $ ] denotes the expression in the @xmath86 equation of motion , on the last line of ( [ 3-eqns ] ) .",
    "also , we denote by @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] the expressions on the first and second lines of ( [ 3-eqns ] ) . to show that one of these three equations is redundant , we find it useful to consider the following two combinations of three independent equations : @xmath94-\\frac{1}{3}[v]&:&0=a^{\\prime\\prime}+(a^\\prime)^2-a^\\prime v^\\prime-4e^{2v}\\\\    \\left[r_{rr}\\right]-[r_{\\mu\\nu}]&:&2a^{\\prime\\prime}+v^{\\prime\\prime}+(v^\\prime)^2    -a^\\prime v^\\prime+\\frac{3}{2}e^{-2v}(h^\\prime)^2\\ .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us take 3 combinations of equations to be @xmath95-[v]}{3}=0 $ ] , @xmath93=0 $ ] and @xmath96\\right)-2e^{2v}a^\\prime\\left([r_{rr}]-[r_{\\mu\\nu}]\\right )    -2e^{2v}v^\\prime\\left(\\frac{1}{3}[r_{rr}]-\\frac{1}{3}[v]\\right)\\nonumber\\\\    & = & e^{2v}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}e^{-2v}(h^\\prime)^2 - 2a^\\prime v^\\prime-2(a^\\prime)^2\\right]^\\prime.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last total derivative can be obtained after some straightforward algebra .",
    "so this equation can be integrated to yield @xmath97-\\frac{1}{3}[v]\\right)-[r_{\\mu\\nu}]\\ , \\ ] ] where the last equation holds for @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the first two equations guarantee this last equation with the integration constant chosen as @xmath98 .",
    "so we have two independent equations for two functions in our ansatz .    to get ir solutions near @xmath99 , we define @xmath100 with a positive number @xmath71 and expand @xmath101 we can set @xmath102 without losing generality by shifting the variable @xmath27 , as all equations have translation symmetry in @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath103 can also be eliminated to , say @xmath104 , by rescaling the poincare coordinates @xmath105 .",
    "we leave it as it is as we want to identify it with a mass parameter in the uv later . plugging these in",
    ", we find @xmath106 at @xmath107 terms of the equations . continuing the iteration ,",
    "one finds the following small radius expansion in @xmath108 @xmath109 with @xmath57 and @xmath110 .",
    "the solution with leading and next - to - leading terms is given by @xmath111 where vol@xmath112 . to obtain the schrdinger solution ,",
    "we first perform a coordinate transformation to a rotating frame . taking @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is twice the khler 2-form of @xmath34",
    ", we define @xmath113 to be the coordinates in the rotating ( or boosted ) frame . for later use ,",
    "we note that @xmath114 is @xmath115 periodic for @xmath116 in our normalization . from the dual field theory perspective",
    ", the shift of @xmath114 is identified as the particle number symmetry , or more precisely the symmetry conjugate the total rest mass as there could be more than one particle species .",
    "so the conserved charge for @xmath16 takes the form of the non - relativistic energy @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are conserved charges for the translation of @xmath120 .",
    "the above metric can be written as @xmath121 note that @xmath122 terms cancels by the coordinate transformation , leaving the leading @xmath123 term .",
    "taking the scaling limit @xmath124 with @xmath125 , one obtains @xmath126 the 5 dimensional metric apart from the @xmath34 part is the schrdinger geometry dual to @xmath10 dimensional non - relativistic field theory .",
    "the coordinate transformation and scaling explained above are to be understood as the gravity dual of the non - relativistic limit .",
    "sch@xmath11 solutions in m - theory of this type was found in @xcite .",
    "however , the solution found there has different coefficients in various terms .",
    "in fact , one can find a generalized solution @xmath127 which includes our solution ( [ ir - solution ] ) and that of @xcite as special cases .",
    "as before , one can eliminate one of the two parameters @xmath128 by scaling @xmath129 in same ratio , after which one parameter remains .",
    "setting @xmath130 yields our solution ( [ ir - solution ] ) , while setting @xmath131 yields that of @xcite .",
    "( with @xmath132 which is our normalization ) , correcting a minor typo in their expression @xmath133 .",
    "relating their quantities with ours as @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 with same @xmath16 , their eqn.(4.4 ) takes the form of ( [ generalized ] ) above . ]",
    "the ` leading behavior ' of the ir solution ( [ leading ] ) before coordinate redefinition , keeping @xmath138 only , might look like @xmath139 fibered over @xmath34 with a compact longitudinal direction along @xmath114 .",
    "however , this @xmath139 fibered over @xmath34 _ does not _ satisfy the equations of motion ( [ 5-equations ] ) itself , although making the leading @xmath107 equations satisfied . namely , there are subleading terms in the equations caused by the leading terms of the functions @xmath140 , to be canceled by the subleading terms of the functions .",
    "there exist @xmath141 solutions in m - theory without any fibration in the @xmath114 angle , which is related to our ` leading behavior ' by replacing @xmath142 with same radii for @xmath139 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "another point to mention is that this @xmath139 can not be obtained by a scaling limit similar to the one we explained above for @xmath143 .",
    "naively , it might appear that the scaling @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 with @xmath148 would do this job . however , the last @xmath114 direction is compact .",
    "this scaling limit demands one to zoom out to the long wavelength along @xmath149 , which does not make sense with a compact direction with a maximal wavelength .",
    "note that the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) to the schrdinger geometry leaves @xmath8 unchanged .    before studying the full flow solution which interpolates the above ir solution with ads@xmath0 uv fixed point , we review the asymptotic expansion in uv @xcite . we obtain @xmath150 with two possible solutions for the coefficients @xmath151",
    "defining @xmath152 , one obtains the asymptotic ads@xmath0 metric @xmath153 upon defining @xmath154 .",
    "the general asymptotic solution is @xmath155 with @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "both modes are normalizable with these coefficients and there are two possible dual cft s in which one mode is the source of a boundary operator whose expectation value is given by the coefficient of the other mode .",
    "we stick to the cft in which the field @xmath52 sources the fermion mass term at the boundary as we review in detail in section 3 , in which the mode with @xmath158 is taken to be the source . the fermion mass operator comes with dimension @xmath159 . from the gravity solution , one can get the precise values of the fermion and boson masses , which we explain in section 3 .    .",
    "the thick / thin lines are plots of @xmath160 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "@xmath82 approaches @xmath75 as @xmath161 ( the value for the @xmath30 vacuum).,width=302 ]    we now study if the ir solution can be interpolated to the asymptotic ads@xmath0 solution at @xmath162 .",
    "we chose the first equation of ( [ basis ] ) and the @xmath52 equation ( [ h - equation ] ) for numerics .",
    "the numerical analysis of the differential equations exhibits the desired interpolation .",
    "the result for @xmath163 is shown in fig [ flow ] .",
    "one can also vary the values of @xmath103 and numerically relate it with the variable @xmath164 in the uv expansion . in doing so",
    ", we should remember that both in the ir and uv solutions we implicitly tuned a coefficient by using the translational symmetry of @xmath27 in the equations . in matching the two solutions , only one tuning is allowed .",
    "so we relax our uv asymptotic behavior by admitting the @xmath27 translation degrees and write the solution as @xmath165 etc . , where @xmath166 is the same coefficient as above .",
    "we fit the two coefficients @xmath167 by comparing the expansion ( [ uv - coefficients ] ) with the numerical solution at two large values of @xmath27 , which we chose as @xmath168 , and find @xmath169 , @xmath170 as functions of @xmath103 .",
    "we find the relation to be @xmath171 @xmath172 appearing as the leading coefficient of @xmath52 in uv is the mass for fermions , consistent with the ir expectation from ( [ coordinate - transform ] ) that @xmath103 should be proportional to the mass parameter .",
    "surprisingly , one can find an exact analytic solution for the whole flow @xcite , @xmath173 where the subscript @xmath174 denotes the 4 dimensional metric in the einstein frame .",
    "( note that their @xmath27 above is not our @xmath27 used previously . )",
    "it is related to our 4 dimensional metric as @xmath175 .",
    "we managed to check this exact solution by a heavy use of mathematica .",
    "we also checked that our ir expansion ( [ small - radius ] ) is completely reproduced from the above exact solution , after relating our ir radial variable @xmath176 with their @xmath27 as @xmath177 according to @xmath178 .",
    "when the 7 manifold is @xmath24 or its @xmath31 orbifolds , we can identify the mass term which drives our flow . at @xmath179 , the m2-brane worldvolume scalars and fermions transform under @xmath26 as a vector @xmath180 and a chiral spinor @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath182 supercharge as well as the conformal supercharge transform as @xmath183 .",

    ", the role of these gauge group representations will be rather minor .",
    "the mass for real fermions @xmath204 , with @xmath205 in @xmath181 of @xmath26 , is given by ( at least on a single m2-brane ) @xmath206 with an @xmath207 symmetric mass matrix @xmath208 .",

    "the mass matrix decomposes under @xmath185 as @xcite @xmath213 more concretely , the possible mass terms ( on a single m2-brane ) look like @xmath214+\\frac{m_{ij}}{2}\\psi^i\\psi^j\\ ] ] with real masses @xmath215 and @xmath216 , real traceless symmetric mass matrix @xmath217 , complex masses @xmath218 , @xmath219 . all but one combination of the first two mass terms proportional to @xmath215 , @xmath216 belong to @xmath211 .",

    "the other ` traceless ' combination @xmath220 , with canonically normalized kinetic terms for the fermions , corresponds to @xmath221 in the above decomposition of @xmath211 .",
    "this is our mass term , as our gravity solution is invariant under @xmath184 . for multiple m2-branes ,",
    "the first two mass terms proportional to @xmath222 can be made gauge invariant by taking traces , as @xmath198 is an adjoint and @xmath223 are in conjugate representations .",
    "we emphasize that , as fermions are in @xmath183 without skew - whiffing , the mass matrix , now given by anti - self - dual 4-forms , decomposes under @xmath185 as @xmath224 without singlets .",

    "the bosonic mass term is also @xmath185 invariant , which is unique up to coefficient : @xmath225 with @xmath226 .",
    "this mass term is actually invariant under @xmath26 , at least for the single m2-brane for which we can decompose complex scalars to real scalars in @xmath180 .",
    "even at @xmath179 in which the uv cft is supersymmetric , it is easy to see that the mass - deformed theory is always non - supersymmetric .",
    "this is simply because the mass is same for all bosonic fields , while there appear two different nonzero masses for fermions .",
    "one can compute the precise values of the fermion / boson masses with the known form of the flux . since we have a cft before mass deformation ,",

    "for the two cases @xmath236 and ( @xmath237 below is the kahler 2-form on @xmath190 , not on @xmath195 ) @xmath238 on @xmath190 , one obtains @xmath239 respectively .",
    "all quantities with the subscript @xmath240 are for the case with the maximally supersymmetric mass deformation , to be compared with the case of our interest . in each case , expanding the fermion mass term in ( [ wv - fermion - mass ] ) , one obtains @xmath241 where the last two masses are those for the complex fermion @xmath197 in @xmath242 and the real fermions @xmath243 in @xmath191 .",

    "now we explain how one can obtain the same masses from the asymptotic @xmath230 gravity solution in the large @xmath229 limit .",
    "contrary to the simple case with single m2-branes , which is described by a free quantum field theory , the masses that we calculate below with the large @xmath229 gravity solution is the bare mass , or the uv mass , of the field theory . since the mass - deformed field theory preserves no supersymmetry , there can be nontrivial quantum corrections for the actual mass of particles in the ir .",
    "the latter masses will be important quantities when one discusses the non - relativistic limit from the field theory .",
    "the procedure of obtaining fermionic masses @xcite is similar to the above calculation for single m2-branes .",
    "the 4-form @xmath250 in @xmath190 defined by @xmath251 and @xmath252 $ ] plays the role similar to the constant 4-form which appeared in the mass matrix for m2-branes in flat space , where @xmath253 is the radius of 7-sphere which we set @xmath75 in our normalization .",
    "@xmath48 above is the flux on the @xmath29 and the radial part only .",
    "working with the asymptotic solution of the form , @xmath254 one obtains @xmath255 .",
    "the resulting fermion masses are @xmath256 as for the overall normalization , we matched with the convention used in @xcite for the maximally supersymmetric mass deformation , in which @xmath257 from the gravity solution leads to the boson / fermion masses @xmath258 .",
    "the bosonic mass can be quickly computed if one takes a probe m2-brane in the mass - deformed uv solution . using the radial coordinate @xmath27 appearing in ( [ uv - coordinate ] ) ,",
    "one obtains a quadratic potential in @xmath27 after partly canceling the contributions from the nambu - goto and wess - zumino terms . in the maximally supersymmetric case and for our case",
    ", we obtain @xmath259 and @xmath260 , respectively , consistent with ( [ single - mass ] ) .",
    "suppose we have a system with particles having various values of mass and global @xmath188 charge .",
    "we consider non - relativistic limit with the @xmath188 symmetry as we did in our gravity solution .",
    "the bosonic and two fermionic fields have charges @xmath261 , @xmath20 , @xmath240 , respectively from ( [ skew - whiffed - rep ] ) .",
    "there could be other particles coming from bound states carrying nonzero global charge .",
    "we take the non - relativistic energy to be @xmath262 , where @xmath118 is the relativistic energy and @xmath263 is some constant .",
    "the constant @xmath263 has to be chosen such that the condition @xmath264 is met for all particles , while being saturated by a subset of them . from the gravity solution , as we made a coordinate transformation @xmath265 , @xmath266 , the conserved charge for @xmath16 is given by @xmath117 , with @xmath267 .",
    "the non - relativisitic field theory only keeps a sector of particles which satisfy @xmath268 when they are at rest . on the other hand",
    ", it discards at low energy all the other particles with @xmath269 at rest , as such particles have large non - relativistic energies .",
    "this is exactly same as discarding anti - particles with non - relativistic energy @xmath270 .",
    "so we have @xmath271 for some constant @xmath263 , where the modes which saturate the inequality survive the non - relativistic limit .",
    "therefore , the non - relativistic theory would be keeping the particles with the largest value of @xmath272 , using the ir masses of the particles .",
    "let us start from the theory on a single m2-brane , described by a free qft .",
    "considering the three elementary particles only , one obtains the ratio @xmath273 thus , on single m2-branes , the @xmath197 mode survives in the non - relativistic theory if one uses @xmath188 as the particle number charge . for the case with large @xmath229 , had all the uv masses been the physical masses of elementary particles without any quantum corrections , one would have obtained the same ratio as the single m2-brane .",
    "the actual values for @xmath274 from our gravity solution are @xmath275 , @xmath276 from ( [ uv - modes ] ) and ( [ uv - ir - relation ] ) , which are both larger than @xmath267 which we obtained from the coordinate transformation .",
    "there could be two possible reasons for this .",
    "it could be that the physical masses for these particles in ir acquire nontrivial quantum corrections causing smaller mass - to - charge ratios : at least nonzero quantum corrections are natural for our non - supersymmetric theories . and/or",
    ", there can also appear bound states of these particles with nonzero binding energies , lowering the ratio .",
    "as the schrdinger geometry comes with an infinite tower of kaluza - klein states on @xmath8 , representing infinitely many particle species @xcite , the last issue of bound states should anyway be an essential ingredient for understanding this system",
    ". it should be interesting to have a better understanding on these quantum aspects of the spectrum .",
    "in this paper , we considered the gravity solutions for a class of mass - deformed cft s in 3 dimensions , and showed that there exist 5 dimensional schrdinger geometries in the ir after taking the non - relativistic limit with a global @xmath277 symmetry . as far as we are aware of , this is the first occasion in which non - relativistic conformal geometries are explicitly derived by taking the natural non - relativistic limit of massive relativistic systems .",
    "one could think of some generalizations and extensions of this idea to various directions .",
    "firstly , one may ask if a similar story holds for the maximally supersymmetric mass deformation of the same uv theory . as the 4-form flux preserves @xmath278 , the flow solution would have two round 3-spheres .",
    "we should be generalizing @xcite and seek for a solution with broken supersymmetry if the witten index calculation of @xcite is implying that the vacuum spontaneously breaks supersymmetry .",
    "let us try to see if a mechanism explained in this paper could be working , namely , if the ` particle number circle ' can shrink in ir to be part of the 5 dimensional schrdinger geometry . as the @xmath277 symmetry is taken from the two round 3-spheres in @xcite",
    ", any shrinking circle necessarily demands that the whole 3-spheres shrink as well , presumably making the ir geometry very singular .",
    "it may also be worth considering the possibility that this vacuum could be metastable , or does not exist at all .",
    "as explained before , the nonrelativistic cft of @xcite is based on the ` symmetric vacuum ' of the supersymmetric mass - deformed theory , with zero scalar vev .",
    "the vacuum preserves supersymmetry only when @xmath279 .",
    "its gravity dual will be highly curved , as the t hooft coupling is small .",
    "still , formal gravity solutions with large curvature are identified in @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to learn something useful from these solutions .",
    "let us also mention at this point that , from the viewpoint of the non - relativistic limit of mass - deformed cft , the appearance of schrdinger geometries as the gravity duals of non - relativistic cft s seems to demand a strong restriction .",
    "to illustrate this point , note that there are many ways of obtaining non - relativistic theories with a given mass - deformed cft if there exist more than one global @xmath277 symmetries , simply by choosing different @xmath277 s as particle number symmetries .",
    "indeed , for the maximally supersymmetric mass deformation , different non - relativistic cft s obtained by choosing different @xmath277 s in the @xmath278 global symmetry were studied @xcite . in our mass deformed theory",
    ", one can also consider using a @xmath277 in the @xmath185 isometry as the particle number symmetry , rather than @xmath188 along the @xmath114 or @xmath8 fiber of @xmath23 as we did in this paper .",
    "note that a crucial ingredient which allowed sch@xmath11 of this paper was the shrinking circle for @xmath188 symmetry , @xmath280 , in ir .",
    "this can not happen for @xmath281 as the @xmath34 part of the metric is finite in ir .",
    "this seems to be implying that , for the geometry of @xcite to emerge as the gravity dual of schrdinger invariant qft obtained from mass - deformed relativistic cft , there should be nontrivial conditions on the quantum dynamics .",
    "it would be interesting to further explore this issue .",
    "our solutions reduced down to 4 dimensional spacetime of the gauged supergravity may not look so well - behaved @xcite . it should be interesting to get a low dimensional intuition for the solutions with schrdinger symmetry to explore a more general class of such solutions , maybe using attractor mechanisms @xcite .",
    "similar studies have been done in @xcite , which attempts to realize the particle number symmetry without using internal isometries .",
    "following the idea of this paper , it might be possible to find flow solutions from ads@xmath11 to sch@xmath282 by studying the consistent kaluza - klein truncation of @xcite based on @xmath283 .",
    "there also exists a holographic flow solution for the 4 dimensional @xmath284 yang - mills theory with an @xmath285 supersymmetric mass deformation , which is singular in the ir @xcite .",
    "perhaps it might be worth mentioning that the original motivation in @xcite of using this geometry to holographically study cold fermionic atoms at unitarity may be demanding alternative realizations of the schrdinger symmetry without using the isometry of @xmath8 as the particle number .",
    "this question has been raised due to an exotic thermodynamics of schrdinger black holes @xcite , probably caused by the presence of an infinite tower of kaluza - klein particle species @xcite .",
    "of course our system would be showing same phenomena , simply due to the appearance of the geometry of the form ( [ schrodinger ] ) .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of @xcite is based on using the d0-brane charge ( geometrizable to m - theory isometry ) as the particle number , which is also the case for our system .",
    "the non - relativistic cft discussed in @xcite essentially has this @xmath8 direction as it is obtained from a @xmath286 dimensional qft in the uv , where the @xmath8 isometry simply comes from the extra direction of the uv field theory . on the other hand , non - relativistic qft s obtained by the standard non - relativistic limit of mass - deformed qft",
    "do not necessarily have such an infinite tower of bound states . from the field theory perspective , the special example of m2-brane cft discussed in this paper seems to be rather exceptional , containing geometrizable d0-brane global charge and exhibiting bound states for all d0-brane numbers .",
    "thus , it could be possible to seek for a study along the line of @xcite , to have a gravity solution invariant under schrdinger symmetry with non - geometrizable particle number symmetry in the context of the mass - deformed cft",
    ".    we would also like to comment that in @xcite , the phases of skew - whiffed field theory with relevant deformations ( i.e. coupled to nonzero @xmath52 field in the gravity dual ) have been studied extensively from the gravity dual , after considering more modes than what we did in this paper .",
    "more precisely , a charged scalar and a massless gauge field were kept , apart from @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , there is a phase transition which appears at nonzero chemical potential @xmath287 and mass , the latter one being the mass that we considered in this paper .",
    "when @xmath287 is sufficiently larger than the mass , the system is shown to be in a superconducting phase with spontaneously broken @xmath277 symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , if the chemical potential is small compared to the mass , the system is supposed to be in a normal phase which is gapped , without the goldstone boson associated with spontaneously broken @xmath277 . in particular , the line @xmath288 at zero temperature on the parameter space that we have considered all belongs to this normal phase . at zero temperature in the normal phase , with all the propagating degrees being massive ,",
    "one may ask if there are interesting non - relativistic solutions like what we considered on the @xmath288 line . although the numerical solution was explained to be singular at zero temperature , this could be physically acceptable . in string theory , there are examples of four - dimensional extremal black holes described by singular geometries , yet being supersymmetric @xcite .",
    "furthermore if we are interested in condensed matter systems with unique ground states , the dual geometries have zero entropy , which often lead to singular geometries .",
    "also , uplifting the 4 dimensional geometry to 11 dimensions could reveal more interesting structures , as was the case on the @xmath288 line we studied in this paper .",
    "finally , it could be desirable to investigate the stability of the solutions discussed in this paper .",
    "an instability was reported for a solution in the skew - whiffed truncation with nonzero values of the charged field @xcite .",
    "although the solution we discussed is more complicated than the ads solution studied there , at least studies of the ir solution ( [ ir - solution ] ) would be doable and worthwhile .",
    "perhaps this problem could be related to the stability analysis of a class of @xmath141 solutions @xcite .",
