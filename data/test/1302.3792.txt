    "this paper is concerned with the classification of legendrian rational unknots in lens spaces . the lens space in question",
    "may be equipped with a tight or an overtwisted contact structure , but in the latter case we require that the knot complement be tight .",
    "legendrian knots in overtwisted contact @xmath2-manifolds with tight complement are called _ non - loose _ or _ exceptional_.    the classification of legendrian unknots in @xmath3 is due to eliashberg and fraser  @xcite . in the case of the tight standard contact structure @xmath4 on @xmath3 ,",
    "their classification is up to isotopy ; in the case of exceptional unknots in an overtwisted contact structure , up to coarse equivalence . recall that two legendrian knots @xmath5 , @xmath6 , in contact @xmath2-manifolds are called _ coarsely equivalent _ if there is a contactomorphism @xmath7 carrying @xmath8 to @xmath9 . here",
    "the contact structures are understood to be ( co-)oriented , and the contactomorphism is supposed to preserve the ( co-)orientation . the classification of legendrian knots in overtwisted contact manifolds up to isotopy is complicated by the fact there are contactomorphisms topologically but not contact isotopic to the identity , cf .  the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4.3 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the classification result of eliashberg and fraser to rational unknots in lens spaces .",
    "our focus will lie on the exceptional case , and we too are content with the classification up to coarse equivalence .",
    "the classification in the tight case is essentially due to baker and etnyre  @xcite , although they give an explicit description only for @xmath0 with @xmath10 odd .",
    "we obtain a complete classification ( both in the tight and the exceptional case ) for the lens spaces @xmath0 with @xmath10 any integer . as an illustration of the general case",
    "we also discuss the classification for @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we determine the range of the classical invariants realisable by such rational unknots , and the @xmath2-dimensional homotopy invariant of the contact structures containing exceptional knots .",
    "this classification is achieved as follows .",
    "the number of distinct legendrian rational unknots with tight complements is determined via the classification of tight contact structures on solid tori ; this strategy has previously been employed by etnyre  @xcite .",
    "we then describe the expected number of legendrian rational unknots explicitly in a contact surgery diagram of the lens space . for the @xmath2-sphere ,",
    "such a description is due to plamenevskaya  @xcite . in all cases",
    "the knots are distinguished by the rational analogues of the classical legendrian knot invariants .",
    "here is an outline of the paper . in section  [ section : unknots ]",
    "we recall the topological classification of rational unknots in lens spaces . in section  [ section : classical ]",
    "we describe a result of lisca et al .",
    "@xcite about the computation of the classical legendrian knot invariants of a legendrian knot presented in a contact surgery diagram .",
    "we extend their result from integral to rational homology spheres and from nullhomologous to rationally nullhomologous knots .",
    "the invariants in this case are the rational legendrian knot invariants  @xcite .    in section  [ section : plane ]",
    "we recall how to compute the @xmath2-dimensional homotopy invariant of a contact structure from a surgery diagram .",
    "this will be used in some cases to show that the contact structure defined by a certain surgery diagram is overtwisted .",
    "sections [ section:3-sphere ] to  [ section : l52 ] contain the classification for @xmath3 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the classification for @xmath3 and @xmath11 is of course subsumed by that for @xmath0 .",
    "nonetheless , the separate description of those two simple cases allows us to include some additional details and to make the whole classification scheme more transparent .",
    "many of the necessary computations are relegated to section  [ section : compute ] .",
    "we understand that blent tosun has been working on the classification problem discussed in this paper using a parallel approach , but staying closer to the argument in @xcite rather than relying on surgery diagrams for the existence part of the classification .",
    "this may in fact be advantageous for dealing with the general @xmath12 .",
    "the lens space @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 coprime to  @xmath10 is defined as the quotient space of @xmath15 under the @xmath16-action generated by @xmath17 this gives @xmath12 a canonical orientation , and our contact structures are assumed to be positive for that orientation .",
    "alternatively , @xmath12 with the described orientation can be obtained by surgery along a single @xmath18-framed unknot in  @xmath3 .",
    "a _ rational unknot _ @xmath19 in some @xmath2-manifold @xmath20 is a knot with a rational seifert disc , i.e.  some cable of @xmath19 on the boundary @xmath21 of a tubular neighbourhood of  @xmath19 is supposed to bound a @xmath22-disc @xmath23 embedded in @xmath24 , cf .",
    "as discussed in that paper , the union @xmath25 equals the complement of an open ball in a lens space , so for the study of rational unknots one may restrict attention to the case of @xmath20 being a lens space .",
    "moreover , a rational unknot we always mean a rational unknot that is not an honest unknot , i.e.  the homological order of the knot is supposed to be greater than  @xmath26 . ] in @xmath12 is then necessarily the spine of one of the heegaard tori .",
    "recall that the genus  1 heegaard splitting of a lens space is unique up to isotopy  @xcite .",
    "hence , up to isotopy there are at most four oriented rational unknots in @xmath12 , namely @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29\\co 0\\leq\\theta\\leq 2\\pi / p\\}\\subset l(p , q),\\ ] ] and likewise for @xmath30 . for @xmath31",
    "this reduces in fact to one possibility , and for @xmath32 , @xmath33 the knot @xmath34 is isotopic to @xmath35 , both being fibres in an @xmath36-bundle over @xmath37 . in homology",
    "one has @xmath38=q[k_1]$ ] , so for @xmath39 there are indeed four rational unknots up to isotopy , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  5.2 ) .    in the surgery picture ,",
    "@xmath40 can be represented as in figure  [ figure : standard - unknot ] .",
    "the knot @xmath30 would be the spine of the solid torus glued in to perform the surgery . by exchanging the role of the two heegaard tori , which induces the orientation - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath41 for @xmath42 mod  @xmath10 ,",
    "one gets a similar picture for @xmath30 , with the surgery coefficient replaced by @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath40 [ r ] at 0 18 @xmath44 [ l ] at 70 20 .,title=\"fig : \" ]    by expanding the rational surgery into integral surgeries along a link of unknots , one can give representations of @xmath40 and @xmath30 in a single surgery diagram .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath45 , @xmath46 we can take @xmath47 . since @xmath48 and @xmath49 we can represent @xmath40 and @xmath30 as in figure  [ figure : k1k2 ] . a slam dunk , cf .",

    "setting , coarse equivalence of two knots is supposed to mean that there is an orientation - preserving diffeomorphism of the ambient manifold sending one knot to the other .    up to coarse equivalence",
    "there is exactly one oriented rational unknot in @xmath12 for @xmath52 mod  @xmath10 , and exactly two for @xmath53 mod  @xmath10 .",
    "the orientation - preserving diffeomorphism of @xmath12 induced by @xmath54 sends @xmath55 to @xmath56 , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , topologically we can ignore the orientation of @xmath55 .    for @xmath52 mod  @xmath10 , the orientation - preserving diffeomorphism of @xmath12 induced by @xmath57 exchanges @xmath40 and @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath53 mod  @xmath10 , there are only two orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath12 up to isotopy : the identity and the one described above , see  @xcite .",
    "so @xmath40 and @xmath30 can not be coarsely equivalent .",
    "however , as pointed out in  @xcite for the tight case , the two different orientations of @xmath40 may correspond to non - equivalent legendrian realisations .",
    "similar considerations apply in the exceptional case .",
    "this gives some information about the contactomorphism group of the corresponding contact structure .",
    "in this section we first recall from  @xcite how to define the classical invariants for _ rationally _ nullhomologous legendrian knots .",
    "we then show how to compute these invariants for knots presented in a surgery diagram of the ambient manifold , provided this manifold is a rational homology sphere .",
    "this constitutes a mild extension of a result due to lisca et al .",

    "let @xmath58 be a rationally nullhomologous legendrian knot in a contact @xmath2-manifold , i.e.  @xmath59 is of some order @xmath60 in @xmath61 .",
    "then there is a rational seifert surface @xmath62 for @xmath63 , i.e.  a surface that is embedded , except along its boundary , which is an @xmath64-fold covering of  @xmath59 .",
    "note that the boundary of @xmath65 need not be connected .",
    "( one can replace @xmath59 by a suitable embedded curve or collection of curves on the boundary of a tubular neighbourhood of  @xmath59 , representing the class @xmath63 in the tubular neighbourhood , and then find an embedded surface with that curve ( or those curves ) as its boundary . )",
    "let @xmath66 be a push - off of @xmath59 in the direction of the contact framing , i.e.  the framing determined by @xmath67 .",
    "then the _ rational thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant _ of @xmath59 is @xmath68 i.e.  the rational linking number of @xmath59 and @xmath66 .",
    "any two rational seifert surfaces for @xmath59 differ by a class in @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath66 is rationally nullhomologous , its intersection number with such a class is zero , so @xmath70 is well defined .",
    "now assume that @xmath59 is oriented .",
    "the contact structure @xmath71 is a trivial plane bundle when restricted to the rational seifert surface  @xmath65 , and the _ rational rotation number _",
    "@xmath72 is defined by writing @xmath73 for the number of full turns of the positive tangent vector to @xmath59 , as @xmath59 is traversed @xmath64 times , relative to the trivialisation of @xmath74 . in general , this number will depend on the relative homology class represented by  @xmath65 . if the euler class @xmath75 is a torsion class , then @xmath72 is well defined .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , any ( closed , connected ) contact @xmath2-manifold @xmath76 has a contact @xmath77-surgery presentation @xmath78 , i.e.  there is a legendrian link @xmath79 in @xmath3 with its standard tight contact structure such that contact @xmath77-surgery along the components of @xmath80 produces @xmath76 .",
    "now let @xmath81 be a contact @xmath77-surgery presentation of a rational homology @xmath2-sphere @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath82 will be a finite abelian group , so the euler class @xmath75 is a torsion class .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath83 be a legendrian knot that becomes rationally nullhomologous in @xmath76 . denote the link components of @xmath79 by @xmath84 , and set @xmath85 , depending on whether @xmath86 belongs to @xmath87 or  @xmath88 .",

    "we can now formulate a lemma that tells us how to compute the classical invariants of @xmath99 when it is regarded as a legendrian knot in the surgered manifold @xmath76 . for the case that @xmath76 is an integral homology sphere , this lemma is due to lisca et al .",

    "however , since it is not entirely clear where the order of @xmath59 in @xmath61 might or might not be relevant for the argument , we deem it worth to include a proof .",
    "before we turn to that proof , we want to discuss the behaviour of the relative euler class of a contact structure under a contact @xmath77-surgery along a legendrian knot  @xmath86 .",
    "a neighbourhood of @xmath86 can be identified with a neighbourhood of @xmath107 , equipped with the contact structure @xmath108 .",
    "we think of @xmath109 as the solid torus we cut out during the surgery .",
    "the boundary @xmath110 of this solid torus is a convex surface with two dividing curves @xmath111 .",
    "these curves lie in the class of the longitude @xmath112 giving the contact framing .",
    "write @xmath113 for the meridian of @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the standard longitude @xmath116",
    ". then @xmath117 .",
    "thus , in terms of the standard meridian and longitude @xmath118 , the slope of the dividing curves is  @xmath119 .",
    "the convex torus @xmath110 has a linear legendrian ruling given by the @xmath120-curves , which represent the class @xmath121 .",
    "write @xmath122 for meridian and longitude , respectively , of a solid torus we glue in to perform the surgery .",
    "contact @xmath123-surgery can be described by the gluing maps @xmath124 contact @xmath125-surgery , by the maps @xmath126 note that in both cases @xmath127 gets glued to @xmath112 .",
    "so the slope of the dividing curves on the boundary of the solid torus we want to glue in is again  @xmath119 , now with respect to @xmath122 .",
    "the legendrian ruling of the convex torus @xmath114 in the original model can be changed from the class @xmath128 to either @xmath113 or @xmath129 by an isotopic deformation of the @xmath22-torus through convex tori of slope  @xmath119 and linear legendrian ruling , staying inside any arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the original torus .",
    "after this modification , we see that contact @xmath77-surgery simply corresponds to regluing a standard solid torus with slope @xmath119 and linear legendrian ruling in the class  @xmath130 .",
    "now suppose that we perform contact @xmath77-surgery along a legendrian knot @xmath59 in a contact @xmath2-manifold @xmath131 .",
    "the relative euler class @xmath132 is poincar dual to the class in @xmath133 represented by the zero set of a generic section of  @xmath134 that coincides with the tangent direction along  @xmath59 . by what we just discussed",
    ", we may assume that this section coincides with the legendrian ruling on the boundary of a standard tubular neighbourhood of  @xmath59 , and this section will extend without zeros over the solid torus we glue in when performing a surgery along  @xmath59 .",

    "it follows that @xmath146    on the other hand , from the mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence of the triple @xmath147 and the assumption that @xmath101 be a rational homology sphere ( as well as some obvious identifications under excision isomorphisms ) we have the short exact sequence @xmath148 with @xmath61 a finite abelian group .",
    "we have @xmath149 . the class @xmath150 maps to @xmath95 in @xmath151 ; the class @xmath130 , to  @xmath26 .",
    "so the sequence reduces to @xmath152 ( alternatively , this follows from @xmath99 being rationally nullhomologous in  @xmath101 . )    hence the poincar dual of the relative euler class @xmath137 over the rationals , @xmath153 is some rational multiple of  @xmath150 .",
