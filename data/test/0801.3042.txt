    "distributed , or collaborative , beamforming has been of considerable recent interest as a preferred solution for long - distance transmission in wireless networks , due to its energy efficiency @xcite,@xcite . in conventional distributed beamforming schemes ,",
    "a set of distributed nodes ( called collaborating nodes ) act as a virtual antenna array and form a beam to cooperatively transmit a _",
    "common _ signal arising from a source node .",
    "using knowledge of network coordinates , each collaborating node adjusts its initial phase so that the resulting beampattern focuses in the direction of the desired destination .",
    "the requirement that all collaborating nodes have access to the same message signal means that source nodes must share their message signals with collaborating nodes before beamforming . to study network performance",
    ", one must take into account the overhead ( information - sharing time ) required for node collaboration .",
    "if a time - division multiple - access ( tdma ) scheme were to be employed , the information - sharing time would increase proportionally to the number of source nodes .",
    "the authors recently proposed a mac - phy cross - layer technique in @xcite and @xcite , based on the idea of collaborative beamforming of @xcite , to reduce the time required for information sharing and to allow simultaneous multiple beams .",
    "the main idea is as follows : for information - sharing , we consider a real physical model in which collaborating nodes receive linear mixtures of transmitted packets .",
    "subsequently , each collaborating node transmits a weighted version of its received signal .",
    "the weights allow packets bound to the same destination to add coherently at the destination node .",
    "each collaborating node computes its weight based on the estimated channel coefficients between sources and itself , and also based on estimates of node coordinates . in @xcite and @xcite the analysis was performed under the assumption that all required estimates are perfect . in this paper , we investigate performance under imperfect conditions , i.e. , when there are channel estimation errors and phase errors .",
    "the notation used here is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ illustration ] . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that sources and destinations are coplanar .",
    "the network is divided into clusters , so that nodes in a cluster can hear each other s transmissions . during slot @xmath0 ,",
    "source nodes @xmath1 in cluster @xmath2 tend to communicate with nodes @xmath3 that belong to clusters @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the beamforming is performed by nodes in cluster @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath5 collaborating nodes , designated as @xmath6 , are assumed to be uniformly distributed over a disk of radius @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the location of @xmath8 in polar coordinates with respect to the origin of the disk by @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 represent the distance between @xmath8 and the destination @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represent the distance between the origin of the disk and @xmath11 . if @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath11 with respect to the origin of the disk , the polar coordinates of @xmath11 are @xmath14",
    ". moreover , let @xmath15 denote the distance between @xmath8 and some receiving point with polar coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "[ htp ]    we further make the following assumptions : ( 1 ) a slotted packet system is considered , in which each packet requires one slot for its transmission .",
    "perfect synchronization is assumed between nodes in the same cluster .",
    "nodes operate under half - duplex mode , i.e. , they can not receive while they are transmitting .",
    "( 2 ) nodes transmit packets consisting of phase - shift keying ( psk ) symbols each having the same power @xmath17 .",
    "( 3 ) communication takes place over flat fading channels . the channel gain during slot @xmath0 between source @xmath18 and collaborating node @xmath19",
    "is denoted by @xmath20 . for intra - cluster communications",
    "small - scale fading plays the dominant role .",
    "thus , for a fixed @xmath0 , we model @xmath20 as circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variables with zero means and variances @xmath21 ( i.e. , this is a rayleigh fading model ) .",
    "the gains of different paths are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) .",
    "the gain of a given path is constant during the slot duration .",
    "( 4 ) for inter - cluster communications , large - scale fading plays the dominant role .",
    "we assume that the distances between collaborating nodes and destinations are much greater than the maximum distance between source and collaborating nodes .",
    "thus , the complex baseband - equivalent channel gain between nodes @xmath8 and @xmath11 during beamforming equals @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the signal wavelength and @xmath24 is the path loss between the center of the disk containing the collaborating nodes and the destination .    in slot @xmath0 , all source nodes within the cluster",
    "@xmath2 simultaneously transmit their packets .",
    "the packet transmitted by node @xmath25 consists of @xmath26 symbols @xmath27 $ ] . due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel , non - active nodes in cluster @xmath2",
    "hear a collision , i.e. , a linear combination of the transmitted symbols .",
    "more specifically , node @xmath8 hears the signal @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] represents noise at the receiving node @xmath8 .",
    "the noise is assumed to be zero - mean with covariance matrix @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the @xmath32 identity matrix .",
    "suppose that in slot @xmath33 , the collaborating nodes need to beamform @xmath34 to destination @xmath11 .",
    "each collaborating node @xmath8 transmits the signal @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the initial phase of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath37 is a scalar used to adjust the transmit power ; it is the same for all collaborating nodes , and is on the order of @xmath38 .    given the collaborating nodes at radial coordinates @xmath39 $ ] and azimuthal coordinates @xmath40 $ ] , the received signal at an arbitrary location with polar coordinates @xmath41 , is @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents noise at the receiver during slot @xmath44 .",
    "the covariance matrix of @xmath43 equals @xmath45 .",
    "the received signal at the destination @xmath11 during slot @xmath44 is @xmath46    it was shown in @xcite that , as @xmath47 and omitting the noise , @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the destination node @xmath11 receives a scaled version of @xmath34 .",
    "the beamforming step is completed in @xmath49 slots , reinforcing one source signal at a time .",
    "compared with the scheme in @xcite , the information sharing time is reduced from @xmath49 to 1 .",
    "multiple beams can be formed in one slot when source packets have distinct destinations . in the rest of the paper , for simplicity we will consider only the case in which a single beam is formed during slot @xmath44 , focusing on destination @xmath11 .",
    "the beampattern represents the distribution of received power along all azimuthal angles .",
    "we showed in @xcite that , under perfect conditions the average beampattern is of a form similar to @xcite , with increased sidelobe level . in this section",
    ", we discuss effects of imperfect channels and phase on average beampattern , respectively .",
    "we model @xmath50 as the imperfect estimate of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the estimation error .",
    "the estimation errors are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variables , @xmath53 .",
    "the average beampattern with imperfect channels can be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the average beampattern related to perfect channels @xmath51 , and @xmath56 is the average beampattern related to the estimation error @xmath52 . following steps similar to those leading to @xmath55 in @xcite , one can obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents the average snr at the collaborating nodes .",
    "note that @xmath56 is actually a constant independent of @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the effect of imperfect channels on average beampattern is an increased sidelobe level .      under imperfect phase , each collaborating node @xmath8 will transmit the signal @xmath60 , where the @xmath61 represents the phase error , which is assumed i.i.d .",
    "with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "we use the same model as in @xcite for the phase errors .",
    "regarding how to obtain the initial phase , two cases ( closed - loop and open - loop ) are considered ( see @xcite for details ) :    \\(1 ) for the closed - loop case , imperfect phase corresponds to the phase offset due to the phase ambiguity caused by carrier phase jitter or offset between the transmitter and receiver nodes .",
    "we assume that the phase error @xmath63 follows a tikhonov distribution , which is a typical phase jitter model for phase - locked loop ( pll ) circuits .",
    "\\(2 ) for the open - loop case , imperfect phase results from estimation errors in the location parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we assume the corresponding radius error @xmath66 is uniformly distributed over @xmath67 $ ] , and the angle error @xmath68 is uniformly distributed over @xmath69 $ ] . the radius and angle errors",
    "are further assumed to be mutually independent random variables , independent of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "based on the above phase error models , we can show that the expressions of the average beampattern are similar to the results in section vi of @xcite with the only difference being a scaling factor .",
    "thus , as in @xcite , the basic effect of these phase errors is in reducing the power in the main lobe .",
    "the derivation is similar to that in @xcite and is omitted here due to space limitations .",
    "under perfect conditions , the received signal ( one sample ) at the destination is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "we showed in @xcite that @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "given @xmath51 , the instantaneous signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) , @xmath74 , equals @xmath75 where @xmath76 follows an erlang distribution ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "given @xmath49 , the sep for m - psk symbols under perfect conditions is @xcite , @xcite @xmath78      taking channel errors into account , the received signal at the destination is given by @xmath79    since the destination node does not have knowledge of @xmath80 , the term @xmath81 represents interference .",
    "thus , in the interference term , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are coupled together , and the exact sep would involve integration of all of the @xmath82 random variables ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath83 ) . in the sequel we will use an approximation that simplifies this analysis .",
    "let us define @xmath84 \\ .\\ ] ] it is easy to show that , given @xmath51 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 according to the central limit theorem , when @xmath5 is large , @xmath87 is approximately normally distributed .",
    "let us thus approximate the distribution of @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "taking into account the independence of @xmath87 and @xmath89 , the approximate instantaneous sinr , @xmath90 , equals @xmath91 which contains only a single random variable @xmath92 .",
    "finally , to calculate the sep under imperfect channel conditions , let us substitute @xmath90 for @xmath74 in ( [ sep ] ) .",
    "the techniques in section iv - a of @xcite can be used to obtain simple bounds for sep .",
    "[ channelerr ] shows the sep versus @xmath93 .",
    "as expected , sep increases with increasing @xmath94 .",
    "the analytical result based on ( [ approxsepcherr ] ) matches well experimental results for a wide range of values of @xmath94 .",
    "imperfect phase has two effects on the receiver : signal power reduction and phase distortion @xcite . assuming that the phase distortion is compensated for by the coherent receiver ( e.g. , by pilots ) , here we focus on signal power reduction only .",
    "we define the power reduction coefficient @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the average received signal power with phase error and @xmath97 is the average signal power under perfect phase .    taking phase errors into account ,",
    "the received signal at the destination is given by @xmath98 where @xmath61 is the phase error of collaborating node @xmath8 .",
    "note that the statistics of @xmath99 are the same as those of @xmath100 ; so phase errors do not change the statistical behavior of the interference term .",
    "assuming we use a coherent receiver , the instantaneous sinr , @xmath101 , equals @xmath102 since @xmath103 and @xmath104 are coupled , the exact sep includes integration with respect to @xmath51 and @xmath61 ( @xmath83 ) , which is computationally complex . to facilitate analysis",
    "we make the following approximation for @xmath101 : @xmath105 in other words , @xmath101 is approximated by the instantaneous sinr under perfect conditions scaled down by a coefficient @xmath106 .    it can be shown that @xmath107 where @xmath108 depends on the specific phase error model used .",
    "based on the phase error models in section [ imperfectphbeam ] , @xmath109 has been derived in @xcite .    : in fig .",
    "[ phaserr](a ) , we show the sep as a function of loop snr @xmath110 ( closed - loop case ) .",
    "the variance of the phase error is @xmath111 . for the analytical sep",
    ", we directly use the results in @xcite to calculate @xmath108 and obtain @xmath112 in ( [ atau ] ) .",
    "as observed , @xmath113 db may be necessary to achieve a satisfactory sep .",
    "[ phaserr](b ) shows the sep vs. @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( open - loop case ) , where both radius and angle errors are considered .",
    "one can see that the phase error in the open - loop case can severely degrade the sep performance .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate techniques that enable accurate location estimation . in both figures ,",
    "the analytical result based on ( [ approxseppherr ] ) match well the experimental results for a wide range of phase errors .",
    "we have considered the cross - layer collaborative beamforming approach of @xcite and @xcite , and we have analyzed its performance under imperfect conditions . for the average beampattern , the principal effect of imperfect channel information is increased sidelobe level , and the principal effect of imperfect phase information is reduced mainlobe power .",
    "we have provided approximate analytical expressions for the sep under imperfect conditions , which show the effects of imperfect channel and phase on that quantity .",
