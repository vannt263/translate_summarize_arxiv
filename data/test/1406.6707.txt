    "astrophysical discs are observed to transport angular momentum .",
    "it has been hypothesised that such discs are transporting angular momentum through a turbulent process @xcite .",
    "despite decades of theoretical research we still lack a sufficient understanding of turbulence to make quantitative predictions .",
    "several candidate processes exist to sustain turbulence in these discs : the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gravitational instability ( e.g. lodato & rice 2004 , 2005 ) the vertical shear instability @xcite and the baroclinc instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mri is still the leading candidate for angular momentum transport in accretion discs ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , at the low temperatures and ionization fractions expected in protoplanetary discs , non - ideal mhd effects become important , qualitatively changing the nature of the turbulence and its associated transport properties , or rendering it ineffective resulting in ` dead - zones ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a corollary to the angular momentum transport problem in protoplanetary discs is the transport of dust particles .",
    "there is large amounts of astrophysical ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cosmochemical ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) evidence to suggest large scale radial transport of dust particles occurs .",
    "in particular , the level of diffusion that results from the turbulence is an unknown parameter . the turbulent diffusion coefficient ( @xmath2 ) is often parametrised in terms of the turbulent kinematic viscosity ( @xmath3 ) as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the schmidt number . assumptions of isotropic , kolmogorov - like turbulence lead to the inference that @xmath6 @xcite ; however , a large range of reported experimental / theoretical / numerical values exist that span approximately two orders of magnitude in the range @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "direct observational measurements of the strength of turbulent diffusion in the continuum will be complicated by dust - drag , grain growth / fragmentation and optical depth effects .",
    "however , it is not only dust particles that will experience turbulent diffusion ; any rare , gas - phase species ( tracer species ) where changes in temperature results in a concentration gradient will also experience turbulent diffusion .",
    "if , for example , a tracer species is predominately produced at a given radius , the tracer will then diffuse away from this radius , with a distribution that is strongly dependent on the value of the schmidt number @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the case of deuterated water and argued the d / h water distribution in chondrites implies the schmidt number is smaller than unity .",
    "snow - lines , where a gas phase tracer ( for example h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , co ) condenses out of the gas to form ice below some temperature represents a scenario where a sharp concentration gradient can occur .",
    "species such as h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 & co are relatively abundant , such that the surface layers can be optically thick .",
    "additionally , model degeneracies make it difficult to constrain snow - lines directly ( even with optically thin isotopologues ) .",
    "however , if the production / destruction of yet rarer tracers are regulated by the presence or absence of gas phase h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 or co then these rare tracers could be used as proxies to detect snow - lines . for the co snow - line it is expected that n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0co will only be abundant when co freezes out @xcite . such an expectation has been born out in observations of star - forming cores @xcite , and similar results were obtained in the discs _ sma _ survey of several nearby protoplanetary discs @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite imaged a hole in n@xmath0h@xmath1 using _ alma _ at a radius of @xmath8 au , co - incident with the expected location of the co snow - line ( based on a free - out temperature of @xmath9  k ) .",
    "the sharpness of the inner edge will depend strongly on the strength of the turbulent diffusion , with weaker diffusion resulting in a sharper hole .    in this letter",
    "we demonstrate how the distribution of a tracer species that is only abundant outside a snow - line ( being destroyed inside ) is strongly dependant on the schmidt number , and that _ alma _ observations could be able to constrain the schmidt number in protoplanetary discs .",
    "we consider a 1d axis - symmetric disc , where the evolution of the gas surface density ( @xmath10 ) and the surface density of any ( gas - phase ) tracer species ( @xmath11 ) is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we specifically consider the case of n@xmath0h@xmath1 destruction at the co snow - line as observed in tw hya @xcite .",
    "inside the co snow - line n@xmath0h@xmath1 is destroyed by gas phase co , outside the co snow line this destruction channel is no - longer dominant and it instead is destroyed at a much slower rate by dissociative recombination @xcite .",
    "simulations without transport suggest the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance drops by several orders of magnitude inside the co snow - line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an abundance that depends on the square of the gas - phase co abundance @xcite .      in order for chemical tracers at the snow - line to be useful in terms of probing the strength of the turbulent diffusion , we must de - couple the chemical and dynamical time - scales .",
    "namely , the desorption time - scale must be faster than the transport time - scales in - order to create a sharp snow - line ; furthermore , the destruction time - scale of the tracer species inside the snow - line must also be fast .",
    "the transport time - scales of interest are the time with which to move a radial distance @xmath17 ( where @xmath17 is the disc s scale height , not @xmath18 . ] which is of order the radial scale length ) .",
    "therefore , the advection time - scale ( @xmath19 ) is : @xmath20 and the diffusive time - scale ( @xmath21 ) is : @xmath22 it is well known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a steady disc model , but it is a more general result - see clarke & pringle ( 1988 ) . ]",
    "the logarithmic concentration gradient rapidly approaches @xmath23 , thus the diffusive time - scale is identical to the advection time - scale ( this is somewhat unsurprising as they are both driven by the same process ) .",
    "thus , the relevant time - scale for the movement of a individual tracer molecule over a radial scale @xmath17 is ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 years .",
    "we want to compare this transport time - scale to the time - scale for the desorption of the snow - line species , along with the destruction of the tracer species inside the snow - line .",
    "considering our example of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and the co snow - line then the desorption time - scale is obtained by balancing desorption with absorption ( with rate constant @xmath26 ) , so the desorption time - scale becomes @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dust - grain size , @xmath29 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio and @xmath30 is the co abundance .",
    "additionally , the destruction time - scale for n@xmath0h@xmath1 is ( from the @xcite simplified network ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the destruction rate constant .",
    "therefore , the co / n@xmath0h@xmath1 system clearly satisfies @xmath33 , for conditions experienced in protoplanetary discs . as such we may ignore the details of the chemical rate equations and simply model the destruction of any remaining n@xmath0h@xmath1 to occur instantaneously at the snow - line radius ; although , we emphasise that the following analysis can be applied to any tracer species with similar destruction time - scales . therefore , in this situation the source function @xmath34 is drastically simplified to : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass - accretion rate , @xmath37 is the concentration at large radius , @xmath38 is the dirac delta - function and @xmath39 is the radius of the snow - line .",
    "this source function represents the instantaneous destruction of any remaining tracer species at @xmath40 .",
    "we note it ignores any possible vertical structure of the snow - line , which will necessarily spread out the destruction region of the tracer species @xcite and we discuss the implications of this caveat in section  4 .",
    "we will now restrict ourselves to a steady disc problem . in that case equation",
    "[ eqn : gas_disc ] becomes @xmath41 : where @xmath42 is the accretion rate , and we have neglected the very small contribution due to an inner boundary at finite radius . furthermore , the equation for the gas tracer becomes : @xmath43=r s_i(r)\\label{eqn : tracer_steady}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the radial schmidt number .",
    "therefore , radially integrating equation  [ eqn : tracer_steady ] and using our expression for @xmath36 we find : @xmath45 using equation  [ eqn : source ] we can integrate equation  [ eqn : conc_steady_intm ] to find the radial concentration distribution : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the heaviside step function . setting @xmath48 at @xmath40",
    "we find the solution : @xmath49 therefore , we see that the radial profile of the concentration is strongly sensitive to the value of the schmidt number . in figure",
    "[ fig : conc ] we show how the concentration varies with radius and schmidt number .",
    "it is important to emphasise that concentration distribution is independent of assumptions of the ( unknown ) viscosity , and mass - accretion rate and can in principle provide a ` clean ' measurement of the schmidt number .     in the range 0.1 - 10 . ]",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to directly observe the concentration gradient . what is directly observed is the surface - brightness distribution of the relevant species .",
    "the surface - brightness distribution is sensitive to the surface density of the tracer species rather than its concentration .",
    "thus , we must multiply the concentration of our tracer species by the gas surface density . adopting a power - law gas distribution of the form @xmath50 with a cut - off radius @xmath51 ,",
    "the surface density of the tracer species is : @xmath52 \\label{eqn : tracer_surf}\\ ] ] in the range @xmath53 and @xmath54 elsewhere .",
    "the actual brightness distribution from rotational emission lines ( such as n@xmath0h@xmath1 j=4 - 3 ) , as well as being sensitive to the surface density distribution is also sensitive to the background gas temperature and excitation temperature of the molecule ( which in turn is a function of density and temperature ) along with the optical depth .",
    "however , in the case that the tracer species is optically thin , and the gas density is far above the critical density ( @xmath55 ) for the rotational transition , then the molecular line is thermalised .",
    "thus , if the temperature gradient is weak compared to the scales of interest and @xmath56 then we can approximate the surface brightness as being directly proportional to the surface density of the tracer species , provided the line remains optically thin .    for the gas at 30  au",
    "the gas density is typically : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean molecular weight of the gas . comparing this to the critical density of the @xmath59 transition of n@xmath0h@xmath1 which has a critical density of @xmath60 @xmath61 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we see that @xmath56 .",
    "we note , since temperature and density are expected to be power - laws with radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then the small additional corrections due to temperature and density effects of converting @xmath11 to the surface brightness distribution ( @xmath62 ) will manifest themselves as changes in the power - law index @xmath63 in equation  [ eqn : tracer_brightness ] .    assuming the disc to be axis - symmetric and observed face - on",
    ", we may write the brightness distribution on the sky as : @xmath64 \\label{eqn : tracer_brightness}\\ ] ] in the range @xmath65 and @xmath66 elsewhere , where @xmath67 is a constant , @xmath68 is the angular size on the sky and @xmath69 is the angular size of the snow - line given by : @xmath70    thus , we see that the brightness distribution still retains the strong sensitivity to the schmidt number .",
    "since the angular resolution required to probe the value of the schmidt number is only available through mm - interferometry , we can use our brightness distribution to calculate synthetic visibilities .",
    "the visibilities can obtained by a hankel transform of the axis - symmetric brightness - distribution such that : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a radial baseline co - ordinate defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 & @xmath75 are the usual baseline co - ordinates . following the observed n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xmath59 emission by @xcite we calculate our synthetic observations at 372ghz with our standard model adopting the best fit parameters from @xcite of @xmath76 au , @xmath77 au and @xmath78 .",
    "we calculate our synthetic observations assuming the source is observed face - on at a distance of 150pc . in figure",
    "[ fig : brightness_vis ] we show our simulated visibility curves in the left - hand panels and the surface density profiles in the right hand panel . in the top panels we vary the schmidt number between 0.1 - 10 , in the middle panels we vary @xmath63 from 1 - 3 and in the bottom panels we vary @xmath39 from 15 - 60 au .",
    "the visibility curves in figure  [ fig : brightness_vis ] clearly show that variations in the schmidt number give rise to significant differences .",
    "furthermore , comparisons between varying the index of the gas surface density @xmath63 , snow - line radius and the schmidt number are not too degenerate .",
    "the simplified model presented here contains four free parameters @xmath79 , which would all need to be constrained by fitting the visibilities .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : brightness_vis ] suggests that sensitivities @xmath80 % at base - lines @xmath81 km would allow the theoretically suggested range of schmidt numbers ( 0.1 - 10 ) to be observationally constrained .",
    "we have shown that observations of snow - lines in protoplanetary discs using a tracer species ( for example n@xmath0h@xmath1 in the case of the co snow line @xcite ) can be used to probe the schmidt number , a unknown parameter in studies of turbulent transport in accretion discs , where current estimates span a range of two - orders of magnitude ( @xmath82 0.1 - 10 ) .",
    "the _ alma _ telescope is a sub - mm / mm interferometer ; once completed it will have @xmath83 individual antennas , offering @xmath84 baselines with separations upto 12  km . at 372 ghz",
    "( @xmath85 n@xmath0h@xmath1 j=4 - 3 line ) this provides a maximum spatial resolution of @xmath86 arcsec .",
    "figure  [ fig : brightness_vis ] clearly shows that _ alma _ posses the required number of base - lines ( @xmath87 ) with separations in the range 0.1 - 1 km to constrain schmidt values within the current range of uncertainty , provided the observations are sensitive enough . taking the tw hya n@xmath0h@xmath1 observations as reference @xcite - a source brightness @xmath88 mjy beam@xmath89 km s@xmath89 with an rms noise of 8.1 mjy beam@xmath89 km s@xmath89 and beam size @xmath90 arcsec made using 23 - 26 antennas then using the current observation to constrain the schmidt number seems unlikely ; however , using the velocity channels separately can be used to increase the effective resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "] - a similar level of sensitivity , but with a beam size of @xmath91 arcsec , could be obtained assuming a fully operational _ alma _ of @xmath8550 antennas .",
    "thus , such observations are feasible and sufficiently high resolution to allow constraints to be placed on the schmidt number at the distance to tw hya .",
    "longer integration times and larger base - lines would be required to reach similar levels of sensitivity at distances of 150pc .",
    "we have argued that the sharpness of the hole in tracer species at the snow - line probes the value of the schmidt number independent of the assumed properties of the turbulence ( e.g. assumed value of the viscous ` @xmath92 ' parameter ) . since several snow - lines are expected to occur at different radii , then measurements at different snow - lines would allow the radial dependence of the schmidt number to be probed . in particular , recent simulation suggest that different non - ideal mhd effects ( which dominate at different radii @xcite ) lead to different schmidt numbers @xcite .",
    "thus , comparing the simulation predictions of the schmidt number for various turbulent driving mechanisms with the observed value would allow inferences about the nature of the turbulence to be made .",
    "furthermore , independently measuring the rms turbulent velocity ( @xmath93 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) then combining it with a measurement of the schmidt number would allow the viscosity ( including estimates of @xmath94 ) to be calculated , since @xmath95 .",
    "we have constructed an idealised model to investigate whether snow - lines could begin to probe the strength of turbulent diffusion .",
    "as such there are several model improvements that must be made before fitting to real data .",
    "therefore , our model presented in this letter is a ` proof - of - concept ' rather than a road map for observational modelling .",
    "for example , a real protoplanetary disc is not one - dimensional .",
    "as such the vertical temperature structure is not constant and passively heated discs cool as one approaches the mid - plane @xcite .",
    "therefore , the snow - line is unlikely to occur exactly at a fixed radius , but is more - likely to be an extended structure with a scale variation of @xmath96 , with is time - varying position @xcite .",
    "additionally the conversion of the gas phase to ice particles at the snow - line will result in turbulent diffusion of the gas and ice particles away from the snow - line ( in identical manner to that discussed for the snow - line tracer discussed here ) . as such",
    ", there is unlikely to be a very sharp change in the gas abundance at the snow - line but rather a smoother change .",
    "furthermore , the chemical time - scales may not fully decouple from the transport time - scales . in the n@xmath0h@xmath1 case considered here",
    "we have argued that the time - scales are likely to be decoupled ; this may not be the case for all snow - line tracer species , thus dynamical modelling which includes turbulent diffusion is needed to determine the importance of this effect .",
    "the model presented here should provide a stringent upper limit of the schmidt number , and good measurement if it is small ( @xmath97 ) ; however , if it is large , and the sharpness of the passive tracer has width of @xmath96 , then the 1d model would only provide an order of magnitude estimate and a better model is need to constrain the schmidt number .",
    "finally , if the snow - line resides in a dead - zone , where there is limited or no turbulence then it is unlikely this method can be used to cleanly probe the schmidt number ; but , dead - zones are not expected at the large radius of the co / n@xmath0h@xmath1 system discussed here .",
    "in this letter we have shown that the recent observations of snow - lines through tracer species ( e.g. n@xmath0h@xmath1 or h@xmath0co in the case of the co snow - line @xcite ) could allow direct observational measurements of the schmidt number in astrophysical accretion discs . in the case",
    "that the chemical time - scale is suitably de - coupled from the transport time - scales then the concentration gradient of the tracer outside the snow - line directly depends on the schmidt number in a power - law fashion ( @xmath98 ) independent of the choice of the turbulent @xmath92 parameter .",
    "we argue that the effect of turbulent diffusion on surface brightness distribution of such a snow line tracer is detectable with _ alma _ observations of discs in nearby star - forming regions which can possess high enough angular resolution to constrain the current theoretically / numerically estimated values of the schmidt number ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "observations of different snow - lines ( e.g. h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 & co ) at different radii in the discs would allow the radial dependence of the schmidt number to be probed . coupling these snow - line observations with observational estimates of the gas - surface density and turbulent line - widths would allow direct estimates of the strength and nature of the turbulence in astrophysical accretion discs ."
