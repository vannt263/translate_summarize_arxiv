    "white dwarfs are the end points of all low- to intermediate - mass stars , which are the majority of stars in the universe .",
    "they are dense stellar remnants composed of electron degenerate cores surrounded by non - degenerate envelopes .",
    "these evolved stars provide key insight into galactic star formation and evolution .    to use white dwarfs as tracers of galactic evolution , we must determine their basic physical parameters , such as effective temperatures ( @xmath3 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath4 ) and masses .",
    "more than 80percent of white dwarfs have hydrogen - rich atmospheres , known as da white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy has been a successful tool in obtaining da atmospheric parameters , yet it only provides a view of the outermost layers of the white dwarf , and it is subject to systematic problems that require correction if the star is cooler than roughly @xmath5k and the surface is convective @xcite .",
    "asteroseismology , however , can probe deep into the interior of a white dwarf and provide information on its composition , rotation period , magnetic field strength , mass , temperature and luminosity , by matching the observed non - radial @xmath6-mode pulsations to theoretical models ( see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "as white dwarfs cool , they pass through instability strips depending on their outermost envelope composition , which coincides with the onset of a partial ionization zone .",
    "this zone efficiently drives pulsations , which cause periodic brightness variations of the white dwarf @xcite . the variable da white dwarfs ( davs ) , also known as zzceti stars , are the most commonly found and studied type of pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "their effective temperatures range between @xmath7k for a typical mass of m @xmath8 0.6@xmath9 , with pulsation periods ranging from @xmath10s @xcite .",
    "ground - based studies of zzceti stars have been carried out for decades , but very few have been observed long enough to resolve more than six pulsation modes .",
    "crucially , there are potentially nine free parameters in the asteroseismic modeling of pulsating white dwarfs @xcite , which has required holding fixed many parameters in order to constrain the internal properties of zzcetis .",
    "it is clear that fully constraining these free parameters and thus the internal white dwarf structure and evolution will require a larger sample of rich asteroseismic observations .",
    "considerable effort has been expended to obtain uninterrupted photometry from coordinated , multi - site , ground - based campaigns to study pulsating white dwarfs , especially through the whole earth telescope @xcite , which has been operating for more than two decades ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the _ kepler _ planet - hunting spacecraft offers a unique opportunity to obtain high - quality , space - based light curves of variable stars , white dwarfs included .",
    "unfortunately , few white dwarfs were known in the original _ kepler _ mission field , and only two pulsating white dwarfs were discovered within the first two years of the mission @xcite . in order to increase this sample , we began the search for all white dwarfs in the original field of the _ kepler _ mission , and more specifically any possible zzceti stars .",
    "we created the _ kepler_-int survey ( kis , @xcite ) in order to select white dwarf candidates using colour - colour diagrams , and report on that search here .    in sections",
    "[ selection ] and [ spec ] , we describe the selection method of our white dwarfs and present their spectroscopic observations . in section [ astero ] , we focus on the nine new pulsating white dwarfs . we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we selected our white dwarf candidates using @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 colour - colour diagrams using data from the _ kepler_-int survey ( kis ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] .",
    "kis is a deep optical survey using the wide field camera on the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope ( int ) , taken through four broadband filters ( @xmath13 ) and one narrowband filter ( h@xmath14 ) , covering more than 97percent of the original _ kepler _ field down to @xmath1520@xmath16 mag @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes for the kis survey are expressed in the vega system .",
    "white dwarfs have bluer colours than main - sequence stars , and most single da white dwarfs also have strong h@xmath14 absorption lines , leading to @xmath17 ( see bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : colours ] ) .",
    "we have integrated the atmospheric models of canonical - mass 0.6@xmath9  ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) white dwarfs of @xcite with the various filter profiles to guide our colour cuts , similar to @xcite .",
    "our photometric selection recovered kic4552982 , the first zzceti star in the _ kepler _ field @xcite .",
    "we narrowed our selection to a small region around kic4552982 and to candidates close to the empirical ( @xmath3 , @xmath20  @xmath6 ) instability strip projected into @xmath21 space .",
    "this left more than 60 white dwarf candidates , 43 of which we were able to follow up spectroscopically ( table  [ phot - summary ] ) .",
    "we were awarded a total of eight nights on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) in 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 , where we obtained intermediate resolution spectra of 43 of our candidates in order to confirm their identities as white dwarf stars and to characterize their atmospheric parameters , especially their effective temperatures and surface gravities .",
    "we used the intermediate - dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) , with the r600r and r600b gratings on the red and blue arms , respectively .",
    "the slit widths were chosen close to the seeing of each night to maximize spectral resolution ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a full journal of observations is included in table  [ tab : specjour ] .",
    "the blue arm was centred at 4351  and the red arm at 6562 .",
    "the spectra covered a wavelength range from roughly @xmath23  in the blue ( see fig .  [ spec - fit ] ) , and roughly @xmath24  in the red",
    ". however , since the higher - order balmer lines contain the most information about the atmospheric parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we only used the blue arm for our balmer profile fits ( section  [ sec : atmosparams ] ) .",
    ".journal of spectroscopic observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in addition to the confirmation of nine new zzceti stars , our ground - based photometry has put relatively strong limits on the lack of photometric variability in eight other white dwarfs with effective temperatures near the zzceti instability strip .",
    "those limits are quoted as a 3@xmath25 threshold in table  [ astero - summary ] , and represented visually with a ft for each object in figure  [ fig : ftnewnov ] .",
    "several of these non - variable white dwarfs have atmospheric parameters that place them within the empirical zzceti instability strip given their uncertainties , most recently updated by @xcite .",
    "it has been assumed that all white dwarfs in this region can foster a partial ionization zone and thus pulsate  that the instability strip is pure  but this claim is still under review @xcite , although there is good agreement between the observed and theoretical zz ceti instability strip ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will not address that issue here , other than to say there are a number of reasons why these objects may appear not to pulsate .",
    "firstly , it is possible the white dwarfs really do vary , but at lower amplitudes than our detection limits allow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , it is possible that subtle issues in the flux calibration of our spectra have introduced unaccounted for systematic uncertainties in the derived atmospheric parameters , and the stars may have true temperatures outside the instability strip . given that the non - variable stars are more or less uniformly distributed in the ( @xmath3 , @xmath26 ) plane , it is likely that the low signal - to - noise of the time - averaged spectra is responsible for some interlopers , as demonstrated quantitatively by @xcite .",
    "the most interesting white dwarf not observed to vary in our sample is the ultramassive j1926 + 3703 , which sits in the middle of the empirical instability strip . at @xmath27@xmath9",
    ", it would be the second - most - massive white dwarf known to pulsate , behind only gd518 @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs this massive likely have at least partially crystallized interiors .",
    "we did not detect photometric variability in this relatively faint target ( @xmath28mag ) to a limit of roughly 6.9ppt , but it is quite possible that this white dwarf pulsates at lower amplitude .",
    "for example , the two most massive known pulsating white dwarfs have low pulsations amplitudes , which rarely exceed 5ppt in a given night and are often far lower in amplitude @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission would have given at least an order - of - magnitude improvement on these nov limits , were these targets observed from space .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that j1909 + 4717 did not vary to at least an amplitude of 0.13ppt using just one month of _ kepler _ data in q4.1 .",
    "however , only the four known pulsating white dwarfs listed at the end of section  [ sec : confirmationnewzzcetis ] were observed before the spacecraft had a failure of its second reaction wheel .",
    "we note that many white dwarfs with atmospheric parameters within the empirical instability strip remain unobserved , and we encourage additional follow - up to constrain pulsational variability in these white dwarfs . we especially encourage further monitoring of the ultramassive j1926 + 3703 .",
    "using photometric colour selection from the kis survey and subsequent medium - resolution spectroscopy from isis on the wht , we have discovered and characterized 42 new white dwarfs in the original _ kepler _ mission field .",
    "follow - up , high - speed photometry from ground - based telescopes confirmed that at least nine of these objects are zzceti stars .",
    "four were subsequently observed from space using the _ kepler _ space telescope , and @xcite report on the first zzceti found in this project , kic11911480 .",
    "asteroseismic inferences from the extended datasets on the other three will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "unfortunately , the failure of the second and critical reaction wheel that kept _ kepler _ precisely pointed towards its original mission field occurred within months of our discovery of many of these new zzceti stars , and our sparse ground - based discovery light curves are so far the only time - series photometry for most of the targets here . at the end of its roughly four years",
    "pointed towards its original field , _ kepler _ observed a total of six pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "however , the two - reaction - wheel controlled _ k2 _ mission will cover a significantly larger footprint as it tours the ecliptic @xcite , and _",
    "k2 _ will likely observe more than a thousand white dwarfs , dozens of them pulsating .",
    "already several important discoveries have come from these _ k2 _ observations of pulsating white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the colour selection methods honed in this work have ensured that dozens of pulsating white dwarfs have been or will be observed by _",
    "k2 _ for up to 80d at a time , using selection from a variety of multiwavelength photometric surveys .",
    "the authors acknowledge fruitful conversations with a. gianninas during the preparation of this manuscript .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp/2007 - 2013 ) / erc grant agreement n. 320964 ( wdtracer ) .",
