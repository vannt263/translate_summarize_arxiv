    "the discovery of a primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) would have a profound impact on our understanding of the early universe @xcite and would help explain the origin of the observed magnetic fields in galaxies and clusters @xcite .",
    "several observational probes are currently being investigated and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is a promising tool to discover and study the pmf on the largest cosmic scales .    a pmf can affect the thermal distribution and the polarization of the cmb .",
    "the most relevant cmb signature depends on the form of the magnetic field spectrum and also on the level of instrumental noise for different observations .",
    "for instance , current cmb bounds of a few ng @xcite on a scale - invariant pmf @xcite derive from temperature anisotropies sourced by the magnetic stress - energy .",
    "comparable bounds were recently obtained in @xcite using the lyman-@xmath0 forest spectra @xcite .",
    "as the stress - energy is quadratic in the magnetic field strength , improving this bound by a factor of @xmath1 would require a @xmath2 fold improvement in the accuracy of the spectra .",
    "on the other hand , faraday rotation ( fr ) of cmb polarization , being linear in the magnetic field strength , offers an alternative way to improve cmb bounds on a scale - invariant pmf by an order of magnitude @xcite , and possibly more , with the next generation cmb experiments .",
    "even current cmb data is close to providing competitive bounds on scale - invariant pmf through their fr signature @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a pmf produced causally in an aftermath of the electroweak or qcd phase transition @xcite would have a blue spectrum @xcite with most of the power concentrated near a small cutoff scale set by the plasma conductivity at recombination .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that such small - scale fields can appreciably alter the recombination history via enhancement of small scale baryonic inhomogeneities .",
    "consequently , the strongest cmb constraint would come from an overall shift in the distance to last scattering . according to @xcite",
    ", upcoming cmb experiments can rule out causally produced fields with a comoving strength larger than @xmath3 .",
    "given the promise of fr to significantly improve the bounds on scale - invariant pmf @xcite , it is important to assess the strength of the rotation induced by the magnetic fields in our own galaxy .",
    "a rotation measure ( rm ) map of the milky way has recently been assembled by oppermann et al @xcite based on an extensive catalog of fr of compact extragalactic polarized radio sources .",
    "they also presented the angular power spectrum of rm and find that it is very close to a scale- invariant spectrum at @xmath4 .",
    "1 of @xcite shows that the root - mean - square rm away from the galactic plane is about @xmath5-@xmath6 .",
    "additional insight into galactic rm on smaller scales can be gained from haverkorn et al @xcite who studied stokes parameters generated by diffuse polarized sources residing inside the milky way .",
    "their power spectra generally agree with the scale - invariance of the large scale tail of the power spectrum of @xcite , but also show evidence of a break in the spectrum , indicating a power law suppression of the rm power on small scales .",
    "such a break in the rm spectrum is also present in the model of minter and spangler @xcite who , by fitting to a small set of rm data from extragalactic sources , argued that the spectrum should be set by kolmogorov turbulence on small scales .",
    "the approximately scale - invariant shape of the galactic rm spectrum can obscure fr constraints on scale - invariant pmf . based on calculations in @xcite",

    "clearly , with such high sensitivities the contribution of the galactic rm to the total fr signal will become important .    in this paper",

    "the black short - dash line is the input e - mode spectrum ,   the black dash - dot line   is the contribution from inflationary gravitational waves with $ r=0.1 $ , while the black   long - dash line is the expected contribution from gravitational lensing by large scale   structure . } \\label{fig : cl } \\end{figure }    the quadratic estimator method is based on the assumption of statistical isotropy of primordial perturbations .",
    "this implies statistical independence of primordial $ e_{l m}$ and $ b_{l m}$ for different $ lm$ pairs , { \\it e.~g . }",
    "$ \\langle e_{l m}^ * e_{l'm ' } \\rangle =   \\delta_{ll ' } \\delta_{mm ' } c_l^{ee}$ for the primordial e - mode .",
    "furthermore , if primordial fields are gaussian , all of their correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the power spectra .",
    "fr introduces correlations between unequal $ lm$ and generates connected four - point correlations .",
    "the corresponding non - gaussian signal can be used to extract the rotation angle .",
    "namely , given a cmb polarization map , one constructs quantities such as \\cite{kamionkowski:2008fp , gluscevic:2009 mm } \\be { \\hat d}_{ll'}^{lm,{\\rm map}}={4\\pi \\over ( 2l+1)(2l'+1 ) } \\sum_{mm ' } b_{lm}^{\\rm map}e_{l'm'}^{\\rm map * } \\xi_{lml'm'}^{lm } \\label{eq : dll } \\ee which is the minimum variance unbiased estimator for $ d_{ll'}^{lm } = 2 \\alpha_{lm}c_l^{ee}h_{ll'}^l$ as shown   in \\cite{pullen:2007tu}. then , each pair of $ l$ and $ l'$ provides an estimate of $ \\alpha_{lm}$ via \\be [ { \\hat \\alpha}_{lm}]_{ll ' } = { { \\hat d}_{ll'}^{lm,{\\rm map } } \\over 2c_l^{ee}h_{ll'}^l } \\ . \\label{alphallpr } \\ee the minimum variance estimator $ { \\hat \\alpha}_{lm}$ is obtained from an appropriately weighted sum over estimators for each $ ll'$ pair .",
    "if all such pairs were statistically independent , the weighting would be given by the inverse variance of each estimator .",
    "however , one has to account for the correlation   between the $ ll'$ and $ l'l$ pairs and a detailed derivation of the appropriate weighting can be found in \\cite{kamionkowski:2008fp}. quantities such as $ { \\hat d}_{ll'}^{lm,{\\rm map}}$ can also be constructed from products of t and b or , more generally , all possible quadratic combinations , { \\it i.e. } \\{eb , be , tb , bt , te , et , ee\\}. one can construct an estimator $ { \\hat \\alpha}_{lm}$ that utilizes all these combinations while accounting for the covariance between them \\cite{gluscevic:2009mm}. in this paper , we opt to consider eb / be and tb / bt separately , since one of them is typically   much more informative than other combinations . for further details of the method the reader",
    "is referred to   \\cite{kamionkowski:2008fp , gluscevic:2009mm}.    we will assume a `` stochastic '' primordial magnetic field such that its value at any given location is described by a probability distribution function .",
    "this implies that one can only   predict statistical properties of fr , such as the rotation power spectrum ,   $ c_l^{\\alpha \\alpha}$. the estimator for the power spectrum directly follows   from the estimator of $ \\alpha_{lm}$ and derives from four - point correlations ,   such as ebeb . in the next section",
    ", we will examine detectability of the rotation   spectrum caused by the galactic and primordial magnetic fields .",
    "we note that the form of the quadratic estimator allows for contributions from the   monopole ( $ l=0 $ ) and dipole ( $ l=1 $ ) of the fr field which , in principle , should not be   ignored .",
    "however , the monopole is generally not expected for fr , since it would imply   a non - zero magnetic charge enclosed by the cmb surface , while the dipole ,   corresponding to a uniform magnetic field , is strongly constrained for the pmf and is   relatively unimportant for the galactic rm .",
    "in addition to mode - coupling correlations of eb and tb type , fr also contributes   to the b - mode polarization spectrum , $ c_l^{bb}$. in fig.~\\ref{fig : cl } we show the b- mode spectrum at $ 30 $ ghz due to fr by a pmf with a scale - invariant spectrum and   effective field strength of $ 1~{\\rm ng}$.the b - mode   spectrum due to fr by the galactic field is also shown for two choices of sky cuts .",
    "for   reference , we show the $ e$ mode auto - correlation spectrum which acts as a source   for the fr b modes , the b modes from inflationary gravitational waves with $ r=0.1 $ ,   and the expected contribution from weak lensing ( wl ) . as can be seen from fig.~ \\ref{fig : cl } , the shape of the fr induced b mode spectrum largely mimics that of the e- mode , and the galactic contribution has a very similar shape to that of the scale- invariant pmf . a more detailed discussion of the fr induced b - mode spectrum can be   found in \\cite{pogosian:2011qv}. as shown in sec.~\\ref{sec : detection } , the   fr signatures of the galactic or scale - invariant pmf are always less visible in   the b - mode spectrum   compared to the eb quadratic estimator , with the latter promising to provide the   tightest constraints .",
    "we note that for causally generated pmf , which have blue spectra   with most of the power concentrated at the dissipation scale , the signal - to - noise ratio   ( snr ) for detecting fr in bb is higher than that in the quadratic estimators   \\cite{yadav:2012uz } , although the resulting constraints are not competitive with   other probes of   causal fields . in",
