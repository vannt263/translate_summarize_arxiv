    "the standard thin accretion disk model @xcite has been widely applied to x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei . due to the basic assumption of the energy balance between the viscous heating and the radiative cooling ,",
    "such a model was known to be invalid for super - eddington accretion case , where the advective cooling is probably significant . instead",
    ", the slim disk model @xcite was introduced to describe super - eddington accretion disks .",
    "however , there exists some conflict between the theory and the observation .",
    "the theory predicts that the advection is negligible for @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath2 is the eddington luminosity , which indicates that the standard disk model should be valid up to @xmath2 . on the contrary",
    ", some works on the black hole spin measurement showed that the standard disk model is likely to be inaccurate for @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , even the recent general model for optically thick disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which unifies the standard thin disk and the slim disk , could not help to obtain a self - consistent spin parameter for @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our opinion",
    ", the above conflict may be resolved if the vertical structure is well incorporated .",
    "most previous works on accretion disks focused on the radial structure in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) . for the vertical structure , however , a simple well - known relationship",
    " @xmath7 \" or  @xmath8 \" was widely adopted , where @xmath9 is the half - height of the disk , @xmath10 is the sound speed , and @xmath11 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "such a relationship comes from the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium with two additional assumptions .",
    "one is the approximation of gravitational potential : @xmath12 , and the other is a one - zone approximation or a polytropic relation @xmath13 in the vertical direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath14 is the total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure and @xmath15 is the density .",
    "obviously , the above assumptions work well for geometrically thin disks , but may be inaccurate for the mass accretion rate @xmath16 approaching the eddington one @xmath17 , for which the disk is probably not thin .",
    "consequently , the relationship  @xmath8 \" may be invalid for @xmath18 .    without the potential approximation , our two previous works investigated the geometrical thickness of accretion disks and the validity of the relationship  @xmath8 \" .",
    "@xcite adopted the explicit gravitational potential in cylindrical coordinates and found that the above relationship is inaccurate for @xmath18 , and therefore the disk can be geometrically thick .",
    "@xcite took spherical coordinates to avoid the approximation of gravitational potential , and found that an advection - dominated accretion disk is likely to be quite thick .",
    "in these two works , however , the polytropic relation is still adopted in the vertical direction , which takes the place of the energy balance per unit volume between the viscous heating and the advective cooling plus the radiative cooling .",
    "the validity of such a polytropic relation , however , remains questionable , in particular for large @xmath16 due to dominant radiation pressure .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to revisit the vertical structure of radiation pressure - supported disks by taking into account the local energy balance and to study the variation of energy advection with mass accretion rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "equations and boundary conditions are derived in section  2 .",
    "a global view of the solutions in the @xmath19-@xmath20 diagram is presented in section  3 . for a typical radius @xmath21 , the vertical structure and the energy advection",
    "are investigated in section  4 .",
    "the two - dimensional solutions and the convective stability are studied in section  5 .",
    "summary and discussion are made in section  6 .",
    "we consider a steady state axisymmetric accretion disk in spherical coordinates ( @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath5 ) and use the newtonian potential , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the black hole mass .",
    "following @xcite , we assume @xmath25 for simplicity , which means a hydrostatic equilibrium in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "simulations , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  3 ) , however , revealed that @xmath26 will be significant for extremely high accretion rates such as @xmath27 .",
    "as shown in the following sections , our solutions mainly correspond to @xmath16 around @xmath17 . for such accretion rates ,",
    "the validity of @xmath25 remains a question .",
    "the basic equations of continuity and momentum take the forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the radial and azimuthal velocity , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the radial and vertical radiation flux , @xmath36 is the gas pressure , @xmath37 is the opacity of electron scattering , and @xmath38 is the @xmath39 component of the viscous stress tensor , @xmath40 . following the spirit of @xmath41 stress prescription , we assume the kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath42 , where @xmath10 is the sound speed defined below ( equation  ( 7 ) ) , and @xmath43 is the keplerian velocity .    we would stress that , even though the @xmath41 stress prescription has been widely adopted for theoretical studies , simulations of magnetorotational turbulence have shown that the stress does not well scale locally with the pressure .",
    "for instance , the simulations on thin disks by a shearing box showed that , the time and box - averaged results are likely to support that the stress is proportional to the thermal ( gas plus radiation ) pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  3 ) .",
    "however , figure  16 of @xcite shows that the maximal thermal pressure is located on the equatorial plane , whereas figure  11 shows that the maximal stress is obviously not at the same place .",
    "these two figures reveal that the stress is not proportional to the pressure locally . in the present study , for simplicity",
    ", we will keep the local @xmath41 stress prescription for numerical calculation , which is a weak point of this work .",

    "@xmath47 is the radiation pressure tensor , @xmath48 is the viscous dissipative function , and the radiation flux @xmath49 is expressed as @xmath50 in this work , we focus on the region inside the photosphere , so we can take the well - known eddington approximation , i.e. , @xmath51 and the eddington tensor @xmath52 .",
    "since we only study the radiation pressure - supported disks , the gas pressure @xmath36 and the gas internal energy density @xmath45 will be dropped in our calculation . in order to avoid directly solving the partial differential equations , some assumptions on the radial derivatives ( @xmath53 ) are required . following the spirit of self - similar assumptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt the following radial derivatives for @xmath10 and @xmath46 : @xmath54 where the sound speed @xmath10 is defined as @xmath55 based on the above two radial derivatives , the following four derivatives can be inferred from equations  ( 1)-(7 ) : @xmath56    with all the above derivatives , we can remove the ",
    "@xmath53 \" terms in equations ( 2 ) and ( 4)-(6 ) , and the following equations are then obtained from equations ( 2)-(6 ) : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62    the seven equations , equations  ( 7)-(13 ) , enable us to solve for the seven variables : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath10 , @xmath15 , @xmath46 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . there are two differential equations in this system .",
    "in addition , the position of the surface is unknown .",
    "thus , totally three boundary conditions are required to determine a unique solution .",
    "an obvious boundary condition on the equatorial plane is @xmath63 .",
    "however , this condition is not applicable for numerical calculation since it is automatically matched as indicated by equation  ( 9 ) .",
    "combining equations ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) we can derive the following equation : @xmath64 an alternative boundary condition on the equatorial plane is then obtained from the above equation ( the left - hand side is zero thus the right - hand side should also be zero ) : @xmath65 the second boundary condition is a definition of the surface .",
    "we define the photosphere as the position above which the optical depth is around unity .",
    "the condition can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is the polar angle of the photosphere .",
    "the third condition is related to the mass accretion rate : @xmath69",
    "in our calculation we set @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath72g@xmath73 , and @xmath74 , where the value of @xmath41 is taken from recent simulations @xcite .",
    "the eddington accretion rate is expressed as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a radiative efficiency of the flow .",
    "we choose @xmath77 since it is comparable to the schwarzschild black hole efficiency of 0.057 .",
    "the dimensionless accretion rate is defined as @xmath78 .    with the equations and boundary conditions in section 2",
    ", we can numerically derive the @xmath22-direction distribution of physical quantities for a given @xmath19 at a certain radius @xmath20 .",
    "the radiation pressure - supported disk solutions in the @xmath19-@xmath20 diagram are shown in figure  1 , where @xmath79 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the parameter space is divided into three regions by two parallel solid lines , roughly with @xmath80 .",
    "the region above the upper solid line is denoted by  outflow \" , where we can not find solutions .",
    "no solution exists probably due to the assumption of @xmath81 in advance . in our view , a real flow located in this region may have @xmath82 and the inflow accretion rate may decrease inward . the physical understanding could be that , for high accretion rates and particularly for the inner radii , the viscous dissipation may be sufficiently large such that the radiation pressure is too strong to be balanced by the gravitational force .",
    "thus , outflows may be driven by the radiation pressure and the inflow @xmath19 drops inward .",
    "on the other hand , simulations of supercritical accretion flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * figure  6 ) showed that the inflow accretion rate roughly follows the @xmath80 relationship for @xmath83 at @xmath84 ( corresponding to @xmath85 due to the definition of @xmath17 with @xmath77 ) .",
    "the slope of the upper solid line in figure  1 , which may be regarded as maximal accretion rates due to our calculation , agrees well with the slope in the above simulations .",
    "the region under the lower solid line is denoted by  gas pressure \" , where no solution is found either . in our understanding , it is probably because the gas pressure can not be ignored in this region , which may be in conflict with the radiation pressure - supported assumption . we would point out that , the lower solid line in this diagram is higher than the well - known line which separates the inner and middle regions of standard thin disks @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , the gas and radiation pressure are comparable for the latter , whereas the radiation pressure - supported disk may require the accretion rate to be higher such that the radiation pressure sufficiently dominate over the gas pressure , and therefore the effect of gas pressure on the vertical structure can be completely ignored .",
    "the region between the two solid line , denoted by  radiation pressure \" , which means that the radiation pressure is completely dominated , corresponds to the solutions of our main interest in this work . in section  4",
    ", we will focus on the vertical structure and the energy advection at a typical radius , @xmath86 , as indicated by the vertical dashed line in figure  1 . in section  5",
    ", we will study the two - dimensional solutions for a typical accretion rate @xmath87 in the range @xmath88 and @xmath89 , as indicated by the horizontal dot - dashed line .",
    "in addition , we would point out that for inner radii such as @xmath90 , the two solid lines in figure  1 may deviate from a real black hole accretion system due to the newtonian potential used in this work .",
    "in this section , we will focus on the solutions at a typical radius @xmath91 .",
    "figure  2 shows the vertical structure of the disk with @xmath87 . in figure  2(a ) , the dot - dashed , dotted , solid , and dashed lines show the vertical distribution of the dimensionless density ( @xmath92 ) , radial velocity ( @xmath93 ) , azimuthal velocity ( @xmath94 ) , and sound speed ( @xmath95 ) , respectively , where @xmath96 is the density on the equatorial plane .",
    "it is seen that @xmath15 significantly decreases , whereas @xmath10 and @xmath97 increases , from the equatorial plane to the surface . in figure  2(b ) , the solid line shows the variation of @xmath98 ( defined in equation  ( 15 ) ) , where the photosphere ( @xmath99 ) is located at @xmath100 , quite close to the polar axis .",
    "the disk seems to be extremely thick according to the position of the photosphere .",
    "however , the profile of @xmath15 implies that most of the accreted matter exists in a moderate range around the equatorial plane , such as @xmath101 , which is more clear in figures  4 and 5 ( discussed below ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the variation of @xmath102 .",
    "there exists @xmath103 for the whole solution , which indicates that the eddington approximation is valid and the solution is therefore self - consistent .    with a more general viscosity",
    ", @xcite studied a geometrically thick , radiation pressure - supported model for supercritical accretion disks .",
    "they showed that there exists a narrow empty funnel along the rotation axis with a half - opening angle @xmath104 .",
    "as seen in our figure  2(a ) , the density drops sharply close to the photosphere , thus a nearly empty funnel also seems to exist in our model .",
    "the difference is that , the disk surface in @xcite is the position where some physical quantities such as @xmath32 diverges , whereas our surface is defined as the position where equation  ( 15 ) is matched , and no divergence appears in our solutions .    for a real disk with @xmath87 , the photosphere may exist between @xmath105 and the present result ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "our argument is as follows .",
    "there are two possible reasons that may cause the present photosphere quite close to the polar axis .",
    "one is that we have ignored the radiation force from one side ( e.g. , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) to the other ( e.g. , @xmath107 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "the other reason is that we consider only the @xmath39 component of the stress tensor , which may cause inaccurate results for small @xmath22 , such as strong shearing of the angular velocity @xmath110 in the vertical direction , where @xmath111 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath112 component assumption may work well for moderate @xmath22 : @xmath101 .",
    "the fact that the surface condition could not be matched in the range @xmath101 indicates that the half - opening angle of the disk ( @xmath113 ) is likely to be larger than @xmath114 .",
    "the profile of @xmath10 in figure  2(a ) is quite different from that in the previous works with a vertical polytropic assumption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". under the polytropic relation @xmath13 ( normally @xmath115 , and for radiation pressure - dominated case , @xmath14 can be replaced by @xmath116 ) , @xmath10 will decrease continuously from the equatorial plane to the surface .",
    "the reason for the opposite behavior of @xmath10 , as implied in figure  2(a ) , is that @xmath15 drops faster than @xmath46 from the equatorial plane to the surface .",
    "figure  3 shows the variation of the quantity @xmath117 with @xmath22 for @xmath118 ( dashed line ) , @xmath87 ( solid line ) , and @xmath119 ( dotted line ) .",
    "if the polytropic relation works well , @xmath117 should be a constant of @xmath120 .",
    "it is clearly shown in figure  3 that , however , @xmath117 varies significantly with @xmath22 rather than being a constant .",
    "more importantly , @xmath121 indicates that @xmath122 is negative thus unacceptable .",
    "we therefore argue that the polytropic relation should be unsuitable for describing the vertical structure of radiation pressure - supported disks .",
    "moreover , since the energy advection is relevant to @xmath10 , we may expect essentially different results on the strength of advection .",
    "figure  4 shows the variation of the vertically averaged advection factor @xmath123 with the mass accretion rate @xmath19 , where @xmath123 is defined as @xmath124 .",
    "the quantities @xmath125 and @xmath126 are expressed as follows : @xmath127 @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are respectively the advective cooling rate and the viscous heating rate per unit volume , as implied by the left - hand side of equation  ( 11 ) .",
    "the solid line in figure  4 corresponds to the total accretion rate integrating from @xmath67 to @xmath131 , as shown by equation  ( 16 ) , whereas the dashed line corresponds to the specific accretion rate integrating from @xmath132 to @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath134 the reason why we calculate for @xmath135 is that the @xmath112 stress assumption may work well for @xmath101 . as shown by the horizontal range of the solid and dashed lines , most of the accreted matter exists in this specific range , e.g. , @xmath136 corresponding to @xmath87 .",
    "the figure also shows that @xmath123 rapidly increases with increasing @xmath19 in the range @xmath137 .",
    "more importantly , the value of @xmath123 ( @xmath138 ) indicates that the energy advection is significant even for sub - eddington accretion disks .",
    "such a result is quite different from the previous one , where advection was found to be significant only for super - eddington accretion case .",
    "@xcite introduced an elegant formula to describe the @xmath139 relationship based on their numerical solutions under the well - known paczyski - wiita potential @xcite .",
    "their equations  ( 15)-(19 ) imply that , for the position @xmath91 , advection is negligible for @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "for the whole disk , advection is negligible for @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "such a critical @xmath16 for the whole disk was confirmed by some recent global solutions under the general relativity .",
    "figure  4.11 of @xcite shows that advection is negligible for @xmath1 for any spin parameter @xmath144 . for @xmath145 ,",
    "i.e. , the schwarzschild black hole , the critical @xmath16 is just around @xmath17 . in our opinion ,",
    "the different results on the advection between the above two works and ours are related to the different approach to describing the vertical structure .",
    "a significant difference is that @xcite and @xcite chose the cylindrical coordinates whereas we adopt the spherical coordinates . of course",
    ", the final results should not depend on the coordinates used .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , there are some interesting differences between the equations written in cylindrical and spherical coordinates .",
    "there is no centrifugal force in the @xmath6 direction in cylindrical coordinates , whereas there is no gravitational force in the @xmath22 direction in spherical coordinates .",
    "@xcite claimed that it is exactly this property that makes the spherical coordinates much better adapted for describing the flow near the black hole horizon .",
    "here , we argue that the spherical coordinates should be more suitable for describing geometrically thick disks as follows . in cylindrical coordinates , in the @xmath6 direction , whether with a polytropic relation between the pressure and the density @xcite , or with the local energy balance @xcite , an approximation for the gravitational force , i.e. , @xmath146 , was adopted for describing the vertical structure .",
    "such an approximation will probably be invalid for @xmath147 .",
    "in particular for @xmath148 , the approximate force goes to infinity whereas the real force ought to vanish .",
    "thus , the cylindrical coordinates seem unsuitable for studying geometrically thick disks . in other words , a geometrically thick disk solution in cylindrical coordinates may not be self - consistent .",
    "@xcite limited their solutions by @xmath149 probably due to this reason .",
    "as shown by their figure  10 , the maximal value of @xmath150 for @xmath151 is @xmath152 .",
    "for higher @xmath16 , the value of @xmath150 will be even larger thus the solution based on the approximate force may be inaccurate . on the contrary , in spherical coordinates , there is no need to make approximation for the gravitational force .",
    "the centrifugal force in the @xmath22 direction , which takes the place of the @xmath6-direction gravitational force in cylindrical coordinates , is derived in this work by solving the vertical differential equations .",
    "thus , our approach to the vertical structure seems to be more reasonable .",
    "we would agree that the solutions in @xcite are likely to be self - consistent since their @xmath150 is significantly less than unity , in particular for the solutions with @xmath153 .",
    "then what are the reasons for the quantitative difference in the advection for @xmath153 between their solutions and ours ? in our understanding , there exist three possible reasons as follows .",
    "first , as mentioned in section  3 of @xcite for their numerical methods , the vertical structure is derived by a given advection factor @xmath123 in advance .",
    "the value of @xmath123 is probably obtained by solving the radial structure on the equatorial plane . moreover ,",
    "their @xmath123 is assumed to be uniform in the @xmath6 direction . on the contrary , we obtain a varying @xmath123 by solving the vertical equations . as shown by our figure  8 , @xmath123 increases significantly with @xmath6 .",
    "we can therefore expect that the vertically averaged @xmath123 at a cylindrical radius will also be significantly larger than that at @xmath154 , which may explain why our @xmath123 is larger than that in @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite assumed a uniform @xmath155 and @xmath33 in the @xmath6 direction , and used the keplerian strain to calculate the viscous dissipation . in our method , however , we include varying @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the vertical direction , and the viscous dissipation is calculated based on @xmath33 instead of @xmath156 .",
    "third , @xcite assumed @xmath157 whereas we have @xmath25 .",
    "as stressed by @xcite , since the stationary accretion flows resemble quasi - spherical flows ( @xmath158 constant ) much more than quasi - horizontal flows ( @xmath159 constant ) , @xmath25 may be a more reasonable approximation than @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , the above three reasons may also be responsible for the different results in the convective stability , as will be discussed in section  5.3 .",
    "as mentioned in section  1 , some works on the black hole spin measurement showed that the standard thin disk model is likely to be inaccurate for @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one explanation is that the inner disk edge is still located at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , but its emission is shaded by the outer disk .",
    "thus , the inner disk radius obtained from the spectral fitting is not true .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the disks in black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries trace the same evolutionary pattern for @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , for the neutron star system xte j1701 - 462 , the boundary emission area maintains nearly constant despite the varying luminosity of the disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  17 ) , which indicates that the neutron star s surface is not shaded .",
    "@xcite therefore argued that the inner disk of the black hole system should not be shaded either due to the similar phenomenon .",
    "they suggested that the inner disk radius moves outward because of the increasing radiation pressure .    in our opinion , from the energy advection , it is easy to understand that the standard disk model seems to be inaccurate above @xmath160 .",
    "as revealed by the lines in figure  4 , @xmath123 is likely to be non - negligible ( probably @xmath161 ) for @xmath162 at @xmath21 .",
    "we would point out that , compared with the paczyski - wiita potential , the newtonian potential in the present work may magnify the viscous heating rate at small radii such as @xmath163 , thus the real @xmath123 at @xmath163 may be smaller than the values showed in figure  4 . on the other hand , for the same @xmath19 ,",
    "since the viscous heating rate at a smaller radius such as @xmath164 will probably be larger than that at @xmath91 , so does the advection factor .",
    "we can therefore expect that , even for the paczyski - wiita potential , the advection at the position close to the isco should be non - negligible for @xmath162 .",
    "consequently , the standard thin disk model , based on the energy balance between the viscous heating and the radiative cooling with the advective cooling being ignored , may be inaccurate .",
    "figure  2 shows that @xmath15 decreases significantly with decreasing @xmath22 , and figure  4 implies that most of the accreted matter exists in the range @xmath101 . in order to have a more clear view ,",
    "we define an averaged dimensionless height as @xmath165 , where the surface density @xmath166 takes the form : @xmath167 figure  5 shows the variation of @xmath123 with @xmath168 ( solid line ) . even though the photosphere is close to the polar axis ,",
    "the averaged height @xmath168 is geometrically slim with @xmath169 .",
    "furthermore , the figure shows that @xmath123 increases with increasing @xmath168 or @xmath19 , which agrees with the classic picture . for quantitative comparison ,",
    "we plot the function @xmath170 ( dashed line ) in figure  5 due to the relationship @xmath171 introduced by @xcite , which is equivalent to @xmath172 here .",
    "it is seen that @xmath123 is not well proportional to @xmath173 . in the range @xmath174 or @xmath175 ,",
    "however , we may regard the formula @xmath170 as a rough approximation .",
    "in section  4 , we focus on the solutions at a typical radius @xmath21 . in this section we will study the disk solutions for various radii .",
    "since the vertical solutions are based on the assumptions of partial derivatives in the radial direction ( presented in section  2.1 ) , it is necessary to derive vertical solutions for various radii to check whether these assumptions are self - consistent .",
    "following the example solution in figure  2 , we study the two - dimensional solutions for @xmath87 in the range @xmath176 and @xmath89 .",
    "figure  6 shows the radial variations of @xmath10 and @xmath46 ( solid lines ) for five polar angles , i.e. , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 . for comparison , the radial profile of @xmath156 , which is proportional to @xmath182 ,",
    "is shown in figure  6(a ) , and an example slope of @xmath183 is shown in figure  6(b ) .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath10 and @xmath46 behave roughly as @xmath184 and @xmath183 , respectively , which agrees with the original assumptions of radial derivatives .",
    "as mentioned in section 2.1 , once the radial derivatives of @xmath10 and @xmath46 are given , the other ones can be inferred from equations ( 1)-(7 ) .",
    "thus , we can expect that the radial derivatives of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath15 , and @xmath34 in the two - dimensional solutions should also be in agreement with the assumptions .",
    "our solutions are therefore likely to be self - consistent .    in our calculation ,",
    "the location of the photosphere does not vary much with the radius , i.e. , @xmath185 for various radii . as discussed in section  4.1 , the real position of the photosphere is likely to be located in the range @xmath186 .",
    "we will make some comparison with simulations for the photosphere in section  6 .",
    "as shown in figure  6 , the derivatives of @xmath10 and @xmath46 deviate a little for @xmath187 and @xmath177 .",
    "such a divergence may be well understood from figure  1 , which shows that the solution for @xmath87 and @xmath187 is quite close to the lower solid line , which indicates that the gas pressure may not be negligible .",
    "in particular for the equatorial plane , the mass density has the maximal value there , thus the gas pressure may be most significant at this position .      in this section",
    ", we will study the convective stability of the radiation pressure - supported disks .",
    "the well - known solberg - hiland conditions in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) take the forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath188 @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the specific angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath191 is the total pressure , @xmath192 is the specific heat at constant pressure , and @xmath193 is the entropy expressed as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the adiabatic index .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath6 components of the well - known brunt - visl frequency are written as @xmath196 @xmath197 and the epicyclic frequency takes the form : @xmath198 thus , the first solberg - hiland condition , equation  ( 21 ) , can be simplified as @xmath199 where @xmath200 is defined as an effective frequency . for accretion disks",
    ", there usually exists @xmath201 ( as shown in figure  8) , so the second solberg - hiland condition , equation  ( 22 ) , reduces to @xmath202 in numerical calculation , we adopt @xmath203 and @xmath204 according to the radiation pressure - supported assumption .",
    "based on the two - dimensional solutions for @xmath87 in section  5.1 , we can obtain the variations of physical quantities in cylindrical coordinates and therefore investigate the convective stability by equations  ( 24)-(25 ) .",
    "we take the cylindrical radius @xmath205 as a typical position to study the convective stability .",
    "figure  7 shows the @xmath6-direction variations of @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 , where the former four quantities are normalized by @xmath211 , and the last one is normalized by @xmath212 .",
    "the positive values for both @xmath209 and @xmath210 indicate that the disk should be convectively stable . for the equatorial plane ,",
    "the result of @xmath213 can be inferred by equation  ( 15 ) of @xcite , which revealed that the disk will always be convectively stable for @xmath204 at @xmath154 .    for further understanding the convectively stable results for @xmath214 , we plot figure  8 to show the @xmath6-direction variations of @xmath15 , @xmath46 , @xmath190 , @xmath215 , and the advection factor @xmath123 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath15 drops faster than @xmath46 with increasing @xmath6 , so the quantity @xmath215 increases with @xmath6 . from equation",
    "( 23 ) we immediately have @xmath216 which is known as the schwarzschild criterion for a constant angular velocity at a cylindrical surface ( @xmath217 ) , corresponding to the so - called barytropic flows where the pressure depends only on the density . as the dashed line in figure  8 shows , the angular momentum @xmath190 ( or equivalently the angular velocity @xmath110 ) does not vary significantly with @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the convectively stable results are easy to understand from @xmath218 .    in a similar study ( vertical structure based on the local energy balance ) of the general model for optically thick disks ,",
    "however , the disk was found to be convectively unstable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as interpreted by the three possible reasons in section  4.2 , the significant difference in the results between their works and ours is probably related to the different approach to describing the vertical structure .",
    "in addition , here we would mention two more details which may help to understand the difference in convective stability .",
    "first , the profiles of @xmath15 and @xmath46 in figure  8 reveal that the absolute value of radial velocity @xmath97 increases with @xmath6 ( @xmath219 inferred from equations  ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) ) . compared with the uniform @xmath155 in @xcite , our increasing @xmath97 with @xmath6",
    "may result in faster drop of @xmath15 in the @xmath6 direction ( steeper slope of @xmath15 ) if we simply assume the mass supply to be comparable .",
    "second , compared with @xcite , the advection in our solutions is significantly stronger , which means that for the same @xmath19 thus comparable viscous heating rate , the vertical radiation flux @xmath220 will be less in our results .",
    "thus , @xmath46 may decrease slower in the @xmath6 direction ( flatter slope of @xmath46 ) due to the less @xmath220 and lower @xmath15 ( inferred from equation  ( 6 ) ) . as indicated by equation",
    "( 26 ) , the flatter slope of @xmath46 and the steeper slope of @xmath15 will both make contribution to @xmath218 , and the disk is therefore likely to be convectively stable .",
    "we would stress that , our solutions are limited by the radiation pressure - supported case .",
    "thus , the present results can not directly show the convective stability of disks for either the gas pressure - supported case or the case of comparable gas and radiation pressure .",
    "actually , we have made some additional calculation for thin disks in cylindrical coordinates to check the convective stability , following the method of @xcite but without considering advection .",
    "we found that the disk is convectively stable for the gas pressure - supported case , whereas the disk is convectively unstable for the case of radiation pressure being significant .",
    "thus , we would agree with @xcite on the convectively unstable disks for moderate accretion rates such as @xmath221 , corresponding to significant radiation pressure and non - negligible gas pressure . moreover , for @xmath222 , the disk will be geometrically thin , thus there is no difference between the assumptions @xmath25 and @xmath157 , and @xmath123 is probably negligible . as a consequence , the solutions of @xcite ought to be accurate .",
    "furthermore , as revealed by the profiles of @xmath46 and @xmath15 in figure  8 , @xmath117 is less than unity in the @xmath6 direction . following the argument in section  4.1",
    ", the polytropic relation seems unsuitable either in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "in addition , as shown in figures  7 and 8 , our example solution for @xmath87 at @xmath205 is terminated at @xmath223 .",
    "the reason is that the solutions in spherical coordinates is limited by @xmath224 ( as shown by the horizontal dot - dashed line in figure  1 ) , which corresponds to @xmath223 at @xmath205 in cylindrical coordinates .      for the region close to the equatorial plane",
    ", we can make some analysis of the convective stability by the taylor expansion method . obviously , we have @xmath226 at @xmath154 from symmetric conditions .",
    "thus , for @xmath225 , the value of @xmath227 can be estimated by the second - order derivative at @xmath228 : @xmath229    based on equations  ( 7)-(12 ) , we can eliminate @xmath32 , @xmath46 , and @xmath35 and therefore obtain a set of three equations for the three quantities @xmath33 , @xmath10 , and @xmath15 . by using the taylor expansion method , together with the boundary condition of equation  ( 14 )",
    ", we derive the following three relationships for the second - order derivatives of @xmath33 , @xmath10 , and @xmath15 ( the ram - pressure term in equation  ( 8) is ignored ) : @xmath230 @xmath231 @xmath232 where @xmath233 is defined as @xmath234 , which is a small value in the analysis .",
    "in our solutions we have @xmath235 at @xmath154 , e.g. , @xmath236 for @xmath87 at @xmath237 .",
    "for the simple case with @xmath238 , the above three relationships provide @xmath239 the second - order derivative of entropy at @xmath240 can therefore be derived by the following coordinate transformation : @xmath241 thus , equations ( 27)-(28 ) indicate @xmath218 for the region close to the equatorial plane .",
    "the disk in this region is therefore likely to be convectively stable .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the vertical structure , energy advection , and convective stability of radiation pressure - supported disks in spherical coordinates . in the @xmath22 direction , we replaced the pressure - density polytropic relation by the local energy balance per unit volume between the viscous heating and the advective cooling plus the radiative cooling , and obtained the distribution of physical quantities such as @xmath15 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath10 , @xmath46 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the photosphere was found close to the polar axis and therefore the disk seems to be extremely thick .",
    "however , most of the accreted matter exists in a moderate range around the equatorial plane such as @xmath242 .",
    "we showed that the polytropic relation is unsuitable for describing the vertical structure of radiation pressure - supported disks .",
    "more importantly , we found that the energy advection is significant even for slightly sub - eddington accretion disks , which is quite different from the previous result that the advection is of importance only for super - eddington accretion disks .",
    "we argued that , the non - negligible advection may help to understand why the standard thin disk model is likely to be inaccurate for @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we studied the two - dimensional solutions to check our basic assumptions of radial derivatives , which indicates our solutions to be self - consistent .",
    "furthermore , we investigated the convective stability of the disks in cylindrical coordinates by the two - dimensional solutions derived in spherical coordinates .",
    "the disk solutions satisfy the solberg - hiland conditions , which reveals that the disk ought to be convectively stable .    to our knowledge , there are mainly two series of simulations on optically thick accretion flows .",
    "one is three - dimensional , radiation magnetohydrodynamic ( rmhd ) simulations by a shearing box , which focused on thin disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other is two - dimensional , either radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) or rmhd simulations for global flows , which included thin disks and super - eddington accretion flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we would like to compare our numerical results with the latter owing to the global , radiation pressure - supported , and geometrically not thin case .",
    "@xcite studied rhd simulations in spherical coordinates with the @xmath41 stress assumption for only the @xmath112 component , for extremely high accretion rates @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245 . moreover ,",
    "@xcite studied rmhd simulations in cylindrical coordinates for @xmath246 . in our results ,",
    "the position of the photosphere is quite close to the polar axis with @xmath185 .",
    "as discussed in section  4.1 , the real position may exist in the range @xmath186 .",
    "in the simulations , @xcite showed that the photosphere is around @xmath247 corresponding to @xmath248 .",
    "@xcite did not mention the position of photosphere , but their figure  4 for the density distribution reveals that the photosphere should exist at a certain @xmath67 significantly less than @xmath180 .",
    "thus , we would express that , for accretion rates around and beyond @xmath17 , the photosphere may exist far from the equatorial plane with @xmath249 .",
    "in addition , we discuss the possible link between our disk model and ultraluminous x - ray sources .",
    "as shown by the upper solid line in figure  1 , there exists a maximal accretion rate @xmath250 varying with the radius .",
    "we argue that the possible upper limit of the accretion rate may help to understand why most ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are not in thermal dominant state .",
    "as mentioned in the review paper of @xcite , there may exist three classes of black holes in ulxs : normal stellar mass black holes ( @xmath251 ) , massive stellar black holes ( @xmath252 ) , and intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "a massive stellar black hole with a moderate super - eddington accretion rate seems to account for most sources up to luminosities @xmath254 a few @xmath255 erg s@xmath73 .",
    "the slim disk model , which is the classic model for super - eddington accretion disks , predicts a dominant thermal radiation from the disk .",
    "however , observations have shown that ulxs are not in the thermal dominant state except only a few sources such as m82 x-1 @xcite and hlx-1 @xcite . in our understanding",
    ", the radiation of ulxs may be interpreted by an optically thick disk with @xmath256 plus strong outflows .",
    "the disk will provide a thermal radiation , which is normally not dominant because of the moderate @xmath250 . on the other hand",
    ", the outflows may make contribution to the non - thermal radiation by the bulk motion comptonization @xcite or through the jet of the radiation - pressure driven and magnetically collimated outflow @xcite .",
    "the author is particularly grateful to ramesh narayan for constructive suggestions and beneficial discussions .",
    "the author also thanks ivan hubeny , da - bin lin , aleksander sadowski , lijun gou , yucong zhu , and shan - shan weng for helpful discussions , and the referee for providing useful comments to improve the paper .",
