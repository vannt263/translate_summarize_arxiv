    "very low energy neutron capture cross sections are important ingredients for nuclear research and applications . in the r - process of astrophysical significance , these cross sections are of fundamental importance as they dictate the path of nucleosynthesis . in applications , we mention energy production in reactors , and medical use in neutron capture therapy as well as in imaging . a recent compilation of these cross section is given in @xcite . in table 1 , we show a sample of this compilation .",
    ".neutron capture cross section for several nuclei across the periodic table .",
    "the choice of the nuclei was dictated by the mass region and the disparity in the value of the thermal neutron capture cross section between adjacent nuclei or isotopes , when available .",
    "the full compilation can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ table2 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is a known fact that the thermal neutron ( 0.025 ev ) capture cross section by @xmath3b is about 0.5 barns . on the other hand the fission cross section of the reaction",
    "@xmath4 is 3.8 x @xmath5 barns .",
    "though the capture cross section for @xmath3b is small , the absorption cross section is very large .",
    "we remind the reader that the absorption cross section , intimately related to the strength function @xcite , contains the capture cross section as a piece , plus other cross sections such as the above mentioned fission one . in the case of heavy nuclei",
    ", one finds similar behavior .",
    "take the case of gadolinium 157 .",
    "the thermal neutron capture cross section is about 2.54 x @xmath6 barns , to be contrasted with the capture by the other isotopes of gadolinium , which are of much smaller value .",
    "in fact the capture by natural gadolinium is 6 times smaller than that by @xmath7gd , yet it is still quite large owing principally to the presence of this isotope in the natural sample .",
    "as such the cross section for natural gadolinium , extensively used as a contrast agent in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) imaging , is    @xmath8    for ultra cold neutrons ( @xmath9 0.001 ev ) , the capture cross section for @xmath7gd can reach 1.2 x @xmath10 barns .",
    "this is comparable to typical atomic cross sections !",
    "the natural gadolinium capturecross section of these neutrons is about 4x @xmath6 barns .",
    "other cases of large thermal neutron capture cross section are @xmath11cd , 2 x @xmath12 barns , and @xmath13xe , 3 x @xmath14 barns . the cadmium isotope @xmath15cd is commonly used as a neutron absorber - moderator in reactors and in other applications .",
    "+        in figure 1 we show the thermal neutron capture cross section for a variety of nuclei .",
    "the boron and gadolinium cases stand out as notable exceptions of having an exceptionally large capture cross section .",
    "to be fair , the @xmath3b capture cross section , ( n , @xmath16 ) , is rather small .",
    "what is very large is the n - induced fission of the compound nucleus , @xmath17b , namely ,    @xmath18    the reaction products , @xmath19 and @xmath20li , are ionizing particles with a high linear energy transfer in environments such as living tissues , and they lose all their energy within a micrometer distance , roughly the diameter of the boron - tagged cell .",
    "the large values of the thermal neutron capture cross section in @xmath7gd ; @xmath21 = 2.54 x @xmath6 ; @xmath11cd ; 2 x @xmath12 barns , and @xmath13xe , 3 x @xmath14 barns , and the @xmath3b(@xmath22 , @xmath16)@xmath19 + @xmath23li ; @xmath24 = 3.84 x@xmath5 barn reaction has received only minor attention as to their explanation .",
    "+ in this contribution we take a critical look at the capture cross section data and present an analysis of both the fluctuating background using random matrix - inspired means , and the aforementioned anomalously large cases . in this latter case",
    "we base our discussion on the idea of a statistical doorway resonance which sits far up in energy but can influence the cross section in basically the same way that such doorways influence the parity violation , `` sign '' problem \" , seen in the measurement of the longitudinal asymmetry of epithermal neutrons scattered by thorium , uranium and other heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "other cases involving the statistical doorways rle in resonance reactions , are the description of pre - equilibrium reactions @xcite , and the decay of giant resonances @xcite . of course ,",
    "collective doorways , namely , states formed by coherent excitation of simple configurations , of 1p-1h coupled to 2p-2h states etc . are used in the description of giant resonance @xcite .",
    "a notorious case of an abnormal resonance reaction , is the intermediate structure seen at low energy @xcite , and interpreted by feshbach and block @xcite as arising from simple doorways , that modulates the compound nuclear resonances .",
    "we refer the reader to feshbach s book on nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "a more recent example , which has been already alluded to above , concerns the parity violation study using epithermal neutron scattering from several heavy nuclei .",
    "the results of the experiments , revealed a `` sign '' controversy , namely , by looking at the longitudinal asymmetry of the neutrons , a , it was found that the average @xmath25 over the compound nucleus resonances , is predominantly positive , contrary to one s belief that the average is zero in accordance with the statistical nature of the cn resonances .",
    "several theoretical attempts were made to explain the `` sign '' problem @xcite .",
    "quite recently , data on the distribution of reduced neutron widths of capture on platinum were obtained and analyzed by @xcite and the idea was advanced that the usual , expected porter - thomas distribution breaks down .",
    "this finding prompted several theoretical works @xcite , which employ in one way or another a doorway mechanism to explain the deviation from the pt distribution .",
    "conventional reaction theory without resorting to doorway was also attempted @xcite .",
    "related phenomena which may shed light on the resonance - dominated large capture cross section are the stochastic resonances @xcite , and extreme statistics @xcite . in the following we discuss in detail the abnormally large thermal neutron capture cross section .",
    "a compound nucleus resonance - dominated thermal neutron capture cross section can be written as , @xmath26\\frac{\\gamma_{n}\\gamma_{\\gamma}}{(e - e_r)^{2 } + 1/4(\\gamma)^2}\\ ] ] the neutron width @xmath27 depends on energy and can be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the reduced width . at thermal energy ,",
    "@xmath30 = 0.025 ev ( t = 300 k , @xmath31 = 2200 m / s ) , the neutron width becomes about 0.1 mev , if a reduced width is taken as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the @xmath34=0 neutron strength function and @xmath35 is the average spacing between compound resonances . from the systematics cited in @xcite",
    "the strength function for an excitation energy of 8 mev and a = 157 , is about 5 @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath16 width @xmath37 is about 0.15 ev . for thermal energies , and a = 157 ( gadolinium )",
    ", @xmath35 is 42.6 ev . accordingly",
    "the ratio @xmath38 = 6.8 @xmath36 is an extremely small number . for all practical purposes the total width in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is @xmath39 .",
    "thus we can write for the @xmath40 reaction , eq .",
    "( 3 ) ,    @xmath41\\frac{1}{(e_n - e_r)^{2 } + 1/4 ( \\gamma_{\\gamma})^2}\\ ] ]    if a resonance is close to the thermal energy , the above expression gives @xmath42 = 1.78 @xmath43 [ barns ] .",
    "the thermal neutron capture on @xmath7gd is @xmath44= 2.26 @xmath45[barns ] .",
    "however , the capture on the other stable isotopes of gadolinium are orders of magnitude smaller ( with the exception of @xmath46gd which has a capture cross section of @xmath42 = 6.0 @xmath43[barns ] ) .",
    "the question that is asked is why the great variation in the value of the capture cross section .",
    "a resonance could be situated close to the thermal neutron energy in the case of @xmath46gd and in @xmath7gd , and not in the other isotopes . however , another estimate of the capture cross section can also be obtained for a resonance energy far from the thermal neutron energy , say , at @xmath47 = 22 ev .",
    "this gives @xmath42= 2 barns , a huge difference from the @xmath47 = 0.025 ev case above .",
    "this difference of about 5 orders of magnitude , is what dictates the difference in the capture cross sections of the gadolinium isotopes . but how accurate a measurement can be to be able to distinguish between an energy level in the compound nucleus at 8.0 + 2.5@xmath48 mev from that at 8.0 mev ? this is hardly possible even with current advances in energy measurement techniques .",
    "the uncertainty in the position of the resonances in the compound nucleus prompted people to speculate that the occurrence of abnormal capture cross section is a random phenomenon .",
    "+ the randomness idea can be better formulated using the concept of a doorway resonance sitting far away from the cn resonances , and having a total width much larger than that of the compound resonances @xmath49 .",
    "most of the discussion to follow was invoked by bloch and feshbach back in 1963 in their seminal paper @xcite on the fine structure seen in the neutron strength function @xmath50 , below the usual giant structure .",
    "this intermediate structure was independentally introduced and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the doorway states are simple 2p - 1h states which are coupled to the neutron and @xmath16 channels , and to the more complicated configurations in the compound system , 3p-2h , 4p-3h , etc .",
    "this latter coupling gives the doorway a spreading or damping width , @xmath51 , the former accounts for the coupling to the open channels and gives the doorway an escape width , @xmath52 .",
    "the door way states are also considered at higher energies in the so - called statistical multistep compound pre - equilibrium emission @xcite . in these reactions the relative importance of the escape to the damping widths @xmath53 , of the different classes of the ever more complicated doorways populated in the reaction is very important . for a very recent review on compound",
    "nucleus reactions see @xcite .",
    "the important feature that distinguishes the doorway resonance from the cn resonance is that the total width of the doorway is @xmath54 , while that of the cn is just an `` escape '' width to the open channels . using feshbach s formula @xcite , @xmath55 , where d stands for the doorway resonance",
    ", we can estimate the average escape width    of the doorway resonance ( taken here to be a single isolated one ) .",
    "the density of states of the 2p-1h doorway states is given by the formula ,    @xmath56}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 is the spin cutoff parameter , g is the average single particle level spacing near the fermi level , given approximately by g = @xmath58 , and the spin cutoff parameter is taken to be @xmath59 .",
    "we take for the excitation energy , @xmath60 , the average neutron separation energy in the compound nucleus .",
    "we show in figure 2 a plot of the 2p-1h density vs. mass number.taking for the excitation energy in the compound nucleus @xmath61gd , 8.0 mev , we obtain for the density of 2p-1h states , the value ( j = 2 , 1 ) , @xmath62 , see figure 2 .",
    "this supplies the escape width of the doorway in @xmath61gd as @xmath63 = 0.18 kev$ ] .",
    "an estimate of the damping width is more difficult to obtain .",
    "however , we can make a reasonable guess of @xmath641 kev .",
    "this will guarantee that the doorway will have an effect over @xmath65 = 1kev/ 42.6 ev = 22 cn resonances . with this value of the damping width , we can assess the condition that the doorway resonance is an isolated one in the sense , @xmath66 = [ 0.18[kev ] + 1 [ kev ] ] /50 [ kev ] = 0.024 , a perfect condition for isolated resonances .    , for thermal neutron capture , @xmath67 ev , is taken to be the average neutron separation energy of the compound nucleus.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the coupling of the neutron channel to the 2p-1h doorway results in a modified expression for the capture cross section . to clearly demonstrate how the doorway resonance affects the capture cross section we resort to the relevant reaction theory as given by @xcite , and first write the amplitude for the @xmath40 transition through the doorway as ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the amplitude for the transition from the doorway to the open channel .",
    "the important difference between the doorway resonance and the compound resonance is that in the former , the total width of the doorway contains a damping width @xmath51 , such that @xmath54 , where the escape width , @xmath52 is the sum of all partial decay widths to the open channels , the usual width of a resonance .",
    "the compound nucleus width is basically an escape width .",
    "the partial width of the doorway is @xmath70 .",
    "we now make the assumption that the doorway state only couples to the neutron channel , and not to the @xmath16 one .",
    "this means that the @xmath16 emission proceeds from the compound nucleus resonances , @xmath71 .",
    "then , we can write @xmath72^{-1}g_{q , \\gamma}$ ] , where @xmath71 labels the compound nucleus resonance . of course experience",
    "has taught us that in general @xmath16 emission can happen both from the doorway as well as from the compound nucleus .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath16 decay of giant resonances in nuclei such as @xmath73pb , @xcite the two contributions are comparable . at the very low neutron energies considered here , and the excitation energies in the compound nucleus , sitting several mev below the giant quadrupole resonances considered in @xcite",
    ", we ignore the `` direct '' doorway @xmath16 decay , and consider this channel to be entirely open only to the compound nucleus resonances .",
    "thus the cross section becomes ,    @xmath74 \\frac{\\gamma_{d , n}|\\gamma^{\\downarrow}_{d}|^2}{(e - e_d)^2 + 1/4(\\gamma_{d})^2}\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & \\frac{\\gamma_{q,\\gamma}}{(e_d - e_q)^2 + 1/4(\\gamma_q)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath71 states are the compound nucleus resonances to which the doorway is coupled and we take them to be such that @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , accordingly , @xmath77\\frac{\\gamma_{d , n}\\gamma_{q,\\gamma}(\\gamma^{\\downarrow}_{d})^2}{(e_{d}^2 + 1/4(\\gamma_d)^2)(\\gamma_{q}/2)^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx \\frac{4}{\\pi^2}\\times 10^{6}[barns][\\gamma_{d , n}]\\frac{(\\gamma^{\\downarrow}_{d})^2}{(e_d)^2 ( \\gamma_q ) }   \\nonumber\\\\   & \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\times 10^{4}[barns/(ev)]\\gamma_{d , n } = 1.0 \\times 10^{5 } [ barns]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the neutron width of the doorway was in our model taken to be equal to its escape width of 0.18 kev .",
    "this is consistent with our assumption that the @xmath16 decay proceeds only through the cn resonances in the vicinity of the doorway .",
    "the above cross section is less than half in value of the empirical one 2.54@xmath78 [ barns ] cited above and listed in the compilation of @xcite . in obtaining the above estimate we have used @xmath79 = 50 kev .",
    "of course it is quite possible that the doorway could be located at a smaller energy .",
    "if we take @xmath79 = 30 kev , we would get for the cross section @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "+ how frequent does such a doorway enhancement occur ?",
    "we can estimate the probability of such a doorway enhancement by considering the ratio @xmath81 , which is the ratio of the cross section in the presence of the doorway , first equation in eq .",
    "( 8) , to that without the doorway .",
    "the width @xmath82 is the usual cn neutron width when no doorway is present .",
    "what is random are the width amplitudes , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , whose squares are the widths . at very low energies where the resonances are isolated",
    "these amplitudes are real .",
    "call the distribution of the amplitudes @xmath85 .",
    "the probability that the ratio @xmath86 defined above attains a certain value , @xmath87 , is obtained by evaluating the integral ,    @xmath88    if a normalized gaussian distribution is taken for p(x ) and for p(y ) , the integral above can be readily evaluated to give , @xmath89 resulting in a very small probability for the occurrence of the doorway enhancement .",
    "accordingly very large values of neutron capture cross sections are inhibited by statistics .",
    "the thermal capture cross section vs. a is exhibited in fig .",
    "1 . for the purpose of theoretical analysis to follow , we show in fig .",
    "3 , the same as figure 1 but with a line that passes through the points .",
    "further , in figs . 4 -6 we present an enlarged figure 3 , which exhibit the maxima in a clear and countable manner .",
    "one notices the abundance of fluctuations in @xmath90 vs. a shown in these figures .",
    "these fluctuations may very well be random , though the capture cross section on a given nucleus as a function of the neutron energy is in the region of isolated resonances .",
    "+ a measure of the statistical nature of the capture cross section which we propose here is the average number of maxima or minima in the cross section as a function of the mass number of the compound nucleus .",
    "this measure was suggested over 50 years ago by brink and stephen @xcite for the cross section vs. bombarding energy , and it relies on ericson s correlation function @xcite .",
    "later in condensed matter theory , efetov @xcite worked out the correlation function in the case of variation of an external parameter such as an applied magnetic field on the shape of a nano devise such as an open quantum dot .",
    "he showed that the correlation function is the square of a lorentzian , in contrast to ericson s function for the variation with respect to energy , which is a lorentzian .",
    "+ recently the results of brink and stephen were extended to efetov s correlation function and subsequently to a general value of the tunneling probability , @xmath91 , ranging between zero , for a closed system , to a maximum value of unity for an open quantum dot system @xcite .",
    "when applying efetov s theory to nuclei , one would ask what is the external parameter ?",
    "we trace the external parameter to the universe which through big bang ( bbn ) and stellar nucleosynthesis created all the nuclei whose thermal neutron capture cross sections are shown in fig.1 . for the purpose of theoretical analysis to follow",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "3 , the same as figure 1 but with a line that passes through the points .",
    "further , in figs . 4 -6 we present an enlarged figure 3 , which exhibit the maxima in a clear and countable manner . the correlation function , defined as @xmath92 / \\langle \\sigma(a)\\rangle^2 $ ] would be @xmath93 ^ 2}$ ] , where @xmath94 is the universal external parameter responsible for the creation of the nuclei shown in fig.1 .",
    "we take this function to be linear in the variation @xmath95 , @xmath96 and accordingly define the correlation width @xmath97 .",

    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    given a cross - section auto - correlation function , @xmath101 , the average density of maxima in the fluctuation cross section is found to be @xcite ,    @xmath102    considering the general case of a tunneling or transmission probability in the interval @xmath103 , the correlation function as a function of a variation in energy , @xmath104 , or @xmath105 can be derived @xcite , @xmath106 where , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . the average density of maxima , eq .  ( [ adm ] ) ,",
    "is then given by , when the general correlation function of eq .",
    "( [ gcf ] ) is used , @xmath111    the tunneling probability alluded to above and used in the compound nucleus case , would be small in the limit of weak absorption corresponding to isolated resonances , @xmath112 \\ll 1 $ ] , and unity in the case of strong absorption corresponding to overlapping resonances , @xmath112   \\gg 1 $ ] . to turn these ratios into a probability we resort to the moldauer - simonius theorem",
    "@xcite which states that in the general case the average s - matrix has the property , det@xmath113 which in the one channel case gives @xmath114}$ ] , where @xmath115 is the average width of the compound nucleus .",
    "the tunneling probability is then taken to be an average transmission coefficient , @xmath116 .",
    "finally we can write for the average number of maxima in the cross section as the energy is varied @xmath117 and as the mass number is varied @xmath118 @xcite ,    @xmath119    and @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the correlation width of ericson s fluctuations and @xmath2 is the correlation width of efetov fluctuations . in the limit of interest to us in the current paper , namely , @xmath122 , we can set p = 0 , and obtain , @xmath123 and @xmath124    this last result is a new one in the nuclear context , and can be used directly to extract the correlation width @xmath2 from the empirical data . in the case of compound nucleus fluctuations , we obtain for 3@xmath118 = 18/50 + 23/50 + 17/50 = 1.16 , see figs . 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "thus @xmath118 = 0.39 , and accordingly giving for the correlation width , @xmath125 , the value @xmath126    accordingly , for all practical purposes , the remnant coherence in the otherwise chaotic behavior of the capture cross section is restricted to @xmath127 = 1 and 2 , which is expected as the nucleosynthesis which produced the nuclei occurs predominantly by adding one or two nucleons ( s- and r - processes , notwithstanding bbn which involves several fusion reactions with @xmath128 2 ) .",
    "the above findings also indicate the adequacy of using a fully statistical description of the compound nucleus , a known fact . of course the doorways",
    "are left out in this discussion as they correspond to extreme and rare events .",
    "in conclusion , we have addressed the question of why the thermal neutron capture cross section by a very few nuclei is very large and escapes the normal trend found in most cases .",
    "we proposed that this effect may be traced to simple 2p-1h doorway states that accidentally affect the neutron capture in some nuclei .",
    "the chance for this to happen is very small as required by the data .",
    "we have also suggested a new measure of the degree of chaoticity of the compound nucleus cross sections based on the average density of maxima .",
    "our findings could potentially be of value in finding other cases of very large capture cross sections and possible application to the study of radiative capture involving exotic nuclei , of relevance to the s - process in astrophysics .",

    "<S> the average number of maxima per unit mass , @xmath0 in the capture cross section is calculated and related to the underlying cross section correlation function and found to be @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a characteristic mass correlation width which designates the degree of remnant coherence in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we trace this coherence to nucleosynthesis which produced the nuclei whose neutron capture cross sections are considered here . </S>"
