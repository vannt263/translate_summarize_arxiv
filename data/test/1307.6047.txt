    "the topic of parity - time ( @xmath1 ) symmetry and its relevance to physical applications on the one hand , as well as its mathematical structure on the other have drawn considerable attention both from the physics and the mathematics communities .",
    "originally , this theme was proposed by c. bender and co - workers as an additional possibility for operators associated with real measurable quantities within linear quantum mechanics  @xcite . however , one of the major milestones ( and a principal thrust of recent activity ) regarding the physical / experimental realizability of the corresponding hamiltonians stemmed from progress in optics both at the theoretical  @xcite and at the experimental  @xcite level .",
    "in particular , the realization that in optics , the ubiquitous loss can be counter - acted by an overwhelming gain , in order to create a @xmath1-symmetric setup e.g. in a waveguide dimer  @xcite paved the way for numerous developments especially so at the level of nonlinear systems , as several researchers studied nonlinear stationary states , stability and dynamics of few site configurations @xcite as well as of infinite lattices @xcite .",
    "interestingly , most of this nonlinear activity has been centered around schrdinger type systems and for good reason , since the original proposal by bender involved quantum mechanical settings , where this is natural and in addition the optics proposal was placed chiefly on a similar footing ( i.e. , the schrdinger model as paraxial approximation to the maxwell equations ) .",
    "nevertheless , there have been a few notable exceptions where nonlinear oscillator models ( involving second order differential equations in time ) have been considered .",
    "perhaps the most relevant example , also for the considerations presented herein , has involved the realization of @xmath0-symmetric dimers in the context of electrical circuits ; for the first work in this context , see  @xcite , while that and follow - up activity has recently been summarized in a review  @xcite .",
    "chiefly , the experimental considerations of these works focused on the linear variant of the gain - loss oscillator system . more recently , nonlinear variants of @xmath0-symmetric dimers in the form of a chain have been proposed in the context of magnetic metamaterials and in particular for systems consisting of split - ring resonators  @xcite .",
    "the latter setting , while nonlinear is also far more complex ( involving external drive and nonlinear couplings between adjacent sites ) and hence was tackled for the nonlinear model chiefly at the level of direct numerical simulations .",
    "our aim herein is to provide a simple , _ prototypical _ nonlinear model , whose linear analog is effectively the one used in the experimental investigations of  @xcite . yet , the nonlinear structure is such that it allows to obtain a detailed numerical and even considerable analytical insights on the phenomenology of such a nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric oscillator dimer . in particular , after formulating and briefly analyzing the linear @xmath0-symmetric coupled oscillator model , we incorporate into it a local cubic nonlinearity ( which can , in general , be of soft or hard form i.e. , bearing a prefactor of either sign ) .",
    "this type of potential , especially in its bistable form , is well known to be a canonical example of relevance to numerous physical settings , including ( but not limited to ) phase transitions , superconductivity , field theories and high energy / particle physics ; see e.g.  @xcite and the review  @xcite , as well as references therein . for the resulting @xmath0-symmetric ,",
    "coupled nonlinear oscillator model , we provide a detailed analysis of the existence and stability of breathing ( i.e. , time - periodic ) states in the system .",
    "we focus particularly on symmetric and anti - symmetric such states that arise from the linear limit of the problem .",
    "we observe that symmetry - breaking type bifurcations can arise for both the symmetric and anti - symmetric branches and eventually highlight a nonlinear analog of @xmath0 phase transition whereby the two branches terminate hand - in - hand in a saddle - center bifurcation .    to provide an analytical insight into the above results , we use the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) which approximates the system by the corresponding nonlinear schrdinger type @xmath0-symmetric dimer for which everything can be solved analytically , including the stationary states , the symmetry breaking bifurcations and even the full dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of the rwa - derived schrdinger dimer reveals natural similarities , but also significant differences between the two models .",
    "for instance , in the way of similarities , both models bear symmetric and anti - symmetric branches of solutions , both models bear principal symmetry - breaking ( of the symmetric branch in the soft attractive nonlinearity and of the anti - symmetric one for the hard repulsive nonlinearity ) bifurcations , and both have @xmath0 phase transitions , involving the collision and disappearance of these two branches . on the other hand , in terms of substantial differences",
    ", it is naturally expected that for soft nonlinearities , the oscillator model can escape the potential well ( and hence have collapse features ) even when the schrdinger model can not ; see for a detailed recent discussion of such features in the hamiltonian limit the work of  @xcite .",
    "more importantly for our purposes , another significant difference is that it turns out that _ both _ branches , namely both the symmetric and the anti - symmetric one have destabilizing symmetry - breaking bifurcations , even though in the schrdinger reduction , only one of the two branches ( the symmetric for soft and the anti - symmetric for hard , as mentioned above ) sustains such bifurcations .",
    "it should also be mentioned that after completing the examination of the prototypical time - periodic states and their floquet theory based stability , we corroborate our bifurcation results by means of direct numerical simulations in order to explore the different dynamical evolution possibilities that arise in this system .",
    "these include among others the indefinite growth for the hard potential and the finite time blow up for the soft potential .",
    "our presentation of the two models and their similarities / differences proceeds as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the underlying linear model and the prototypical nonlinear extension thereof . in section iii , we discuss the numerical setup for analyzing the model and its solutions , while in section iv , we provide a means of theoretical analysis in the form of the rotating wave approximation . in section",
    "v , we present the numerical results , separating the cases of the soft and hard potential .",
    "finally , in section vi , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions , as well as some directions for future study .",
    "we consider the system motivated by recent experimental realizations in electrical circuits of the form : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 characterizes the internal oscillator at each mode ; in the case of the electrical circuit model this is the oscillation of each of the charges within the dimer  @xcite .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath4 reflects the coupling between the two elements in the dimer , while @xmath5 is proportional to the amplification / resistance within the system .",
    "one can try to identify the eigenvalues of the system by using @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but one obtains in this case a quadratic pencil for the relevant eigenvalue problem .",
    "it is thus easier to formulate this as a @xmath8 first order ( linear ) dynamical system according to : @xmath9 ( where @xmath3 has been rescaled without loss of generality to unity , and other quantities such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 and time have been rescaled by @xmath10 -the first- and @xmath3 -the latter two- , respectively ) .",
    "we can then seek solutions of the form @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , to obtain a first order eigenvalue problem which yields the following eigenvalues @xmath15 these two pairs of imaginary ( for small @xmath5 ) eigenvalues will collide and give rise to a quartet for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 satisfies the condition : @xmath18 hence eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) will define , _ at the linear level _ , the point of the so - called  @xcite @xmath0 phase transition and of bifurcation into the complex plane .",
    "now , our main interest in what follows will be to examine a prototypical nonlinear variant of the problem which will be formulated as follows .",
    "in particular , we set up the form of the equations : @xmath19 here , in parallel to what is done in the @xmath0-symmetric schrdinger dimer typically  @xcite , we have added a cubic onsite nonlinearity on each one of the nodes . for @xmath20 ,",
    "this nonlinearity is soft , imposing a finite ( maximal energy ) height type of potential , enabling the possibility of indefinite growth by means of the escape scenario considered earlier e.g. in  @xcite ( see also references therein ) . on the other hand , for @xmath21 ,",
    "the nonlinearity is hard , and the potential is monostable bearing only the ground state at @xmath22 and no possibility for such finite time collapse ( in the hamiltonian analog of the model , only the potential for oscillations around the @xmath22 state exists in this case of the hard potential ) .",
    "we now discuss the setup and numerical methods , as well as the type of diagnostics that we use for this system . in our description",
    "below , we follow an approach reminiscent of that in  @xcite .",
    "in order to calculate periodic orbits in the @xmath0 nonlinear oscillator dimer , we make use of a fourier space implementation of the dynamical equations and continuations in frequency or gain / loss parameter are performed via a path - following ( newton - raphson ) method .",
    "fourier space methods are based on the fact that the solutions are @xmath23-periodic ; for a detailed explanation of these methods , the reader is referred to refs .",
    "the method has the advantage , among others , of providing an explicit , analytical form of the jacobian .",
    "thus , the solution for the two nodes can be expressed in terms of a truncated fourier series expansion :    @xmath24    with @xmath25 being the maximum of the absolute value of the running index @xmath26 in our galerkin truncation of the full fourier series solution . in the numerics , @xmath25 has been chosen as 21 .",
    "after the introduction of ( [ eq : series ] ) , the dynamical equations ( [ eqn9])-([eqn10 ] ) yield a set of @xmath27 nonlinear , coupled algebraic equations :    @xmath28-s z_k=0 , \\\\      f_{k,2 } & \\equiv & -{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}^2k^2z_k+{\\mathrm{i}}\\gamma{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}k z_k+{\\mathcal{f}}_k[v'(v)]-s y_k=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath29 . here , @xmath30 denotes the discrete fourier transform :    @xmath31=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{n =- k_m}^{k_m}v'\\left(\\sum_{p =- k_m}^{k_m}y_p\\exp\\left[{\\mathrm{i}}\\frac{2\\pi p n}{n}\\right]\\right )      \\exp\\left[-{\\mathrm{i}}\\frac{2\\pi k n}{n}\\right],\\ ] ]    with @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure for @xmath33 is similar to the previous one .",
    "as @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be real functions , it implies that @xmath36 .    an important diagnostic quantity for probing the dependence of the solutions on parameters such as the gain / loss strength @xmath5 , or the oscillation frequency @xmath37 is the averaged over a period energy , defined as : @xmath38 with the hamiltonian ( of the case without gain / loss ) being @xmath39 and constituting a conserved quantity of the dynamics in the hamiltonian limit of @xmath40 .      in order to study the spectral stability of periodic orbits , we introduce a small perturbation @xmath41 to a given solution @xmath42 of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn9])-([eqn10 ] ) according to @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "then , the equations satisfied to first order in @xmath45 read :    @xmath46    or , in a more compact form : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the relevant linearization operator . in order to study the spectral ( linear ) stability analysis of the relevant solution",
    ", a floquet analysis can be performed if there exists @xmath49 so that the map @xmath50 has a fixed point ( which constitutes a periodic orbit of the original system ) .",
    "then , the stability properties are given by the spectrum of the floquet operator @xmath51 ( whose matrix representation is the monodromy ) defined as : @xmath52    the @xmath53 monodromy eigenvalues @xmath54 are dubbed the _ floquet multipliers _ and @xmath55 are denoted as _ floquet exponents _ ( fes ) .",
    "this operator is real , which implies that there is always a pair of multipliers at @xmath56 ( corresponding to the so - called phase and growth modes  @xcite ) and that the eigenvalues come in pairs @xmath57 . as a consequence , due to the `` simplicity '' of the fe structure ( one pair always at @xmath56 and one additional pair ) there can not exist hopf bifurcations in the dimer , as such bifurcations would imply the collision of two pairs of multipliers and the consequent formation of a quadruplet of eigenvalues which is impossible here . nevertheless , in the present problem",
    ", the motion of the pair of multipliers can lead to instability through exiting ( through @xmath56 or @xmath58 ) on the real line leading to one multiplier ( in absolute value ) larger than @xmath56 and one smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "we will explore a scenario of this kind of instability in what follows .",
    "having set up the existence and stability problem , we now complete our theoretical analysis by exploring the outcome of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "the rwa provides a means of connection with the extensively analyzed @xmath0-symmetric schrdinger dimer  @xcite .",
    "this link follows a path similar to what has been earlier proposed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the following ansatz is used to approximate the solution of the periodic orbit problem as a roughly monochromatic wavepacket of frequency @xmath37 ( for @xmath59 in what follows we will seek stationary states ) .",
    "@xmath60    by supposing that @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( i.e. , that @xmath63 varies slowly on the scale of the oscillation of the actual exact time periodic state ) , discarding the terms multiplying @xmath64 , the dynamical equations ( [ eqn9])-([eqn10 ] ) transform into a set of coupled schrdinger type equations : @xmath65\\phi_1 + s \\phi_2 , \\nonumber \\\\ 2{\\mathrm{i}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\dot{\\phi}_2 & = & [ ( { \\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}^2 - 1)+3\\epsilon|\\phi_2|^2-{\\mathrm{i}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\gamma]\\phi_2 + s \\phi_1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , forming , under these approximations , a @xmath0-symmetric schrdinger dimer . the stationary solutions of this dimer can then be used in order to reconstruct via eq .  ( [ eq : series ] ) the solutions of the rwa to the original @xmath0-symmetric oscillator dimer .",
    "these stationary solutions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy the algebraic conditions    @xmath68    with    @xmath69    recast in this form , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rwa1])-([eq : rwa2 ] ) are identical to that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.(6 ) ) .",
    "we express @xmath70 and @xmath71 in polar form :    @xmath72    and then rewrite the stationary equations as    @xmath73    in the hamiltonian case @xmath40 , and consequently , @xmath74 .",
    "three different solutions may exist therein , namely , the symmetric ( s ) , anti - symmetric ( a ) and asymmetric ( as ) solutions , given by :    @xmath75/(6 \\epsilon ) . & \\textrm{as solution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the symmetric solution derives from the linear mode located at @xmath76 whereas the anti - symmetric solution bifurcates from the mode at @xmath77 .",
    "straightforwardly ( by examining the quantity under the radical in its profile ) , the as solution exists for @xmath78 , bifurcating via a symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation from the s solution if the potential is soft ( @xmath20 ) . on the contrary , if the potential is hard , the as solution bifurcates from the a solution and exists for @xmath79 . the emerging ( `` daughter '' ) as solutions inherit the stability of their s or a `` parent '' and are therefore stable whereas the respective parent branches become destabilized past the bifurcation point",
    ".      the average energy for both the s and a solutions is given by the same expression :    @xmath88    as both solutions coincide at the @xmath0 bifurcation critical point , their energy will also be the same therein .",
    "we now turn to the linear stability of the different solutions within the rwa .",
    "the spectral analysis of the s and a solutions can be obtained by considering small perturbations [ of order @xmath89 , with @xmath90 of the stationary solutions .",
    "the stability can be determined by substituting the ansatz below into ( [ eq : dnls ] ) and then solving the ensuing [ to o@xmath91 eigenvalue problem :    @xmath92    with @xmath93 being the orbit s period and @xmath55 being the floquet exponent ( fe ) .",
    "the non - zero fes are given by :      as instability is marked by an imaginary value of @xmath55 , the above expression implies that there is a stability change when the square root argument becomes zero , i.e. @xmath95 , with    @xmath96    a straightforward analysis shows , in addition , that the s ( a ) solution experiences the change of stability bifurcation when @xmath37 is smaller ( larger ) than 1 .",
    "thus , the s ( a ) solution is always stable when the potential is hard ( soft ) and stable if @xmath97 when the potential is soft ( hard ) . as we will see below",
    ", it is precisely this prediction of the rwa that will be `` violated '' from the full numerics of the @xmath0-symmetric oscillator model .",
    "in particular , it will be found that in the latter model , _ both _ branches in each ( soft or hard ) case can become unstable through such symmetry - breaking bifurcations within suitable parametric regimes .    as a final theoretical remark , it is relevant to point out that while no additional stationary solutions have been argued to exist in the schrdinger dimer , a `` reconciliation '' with the expected picture of a pitchfork bifurcation has been offered e.g. in  @xcite ( see also references therein ) through the notion of the so - called ghost states .",
    "these are solutions for which the propagation constant parameter @xmath98 becomes complex ( and the pitchfork bifurcation resurfaces in diagnostics such as the imaginary part of @xmath98 ) .",
    "nevertheless and especially because complex eigenvalue parameters are of lesser apparent physical relevance in models such as the oscillator one considered herein , we will not further pursue an analogy to such ghost states here , but will instead restrain our considerations hereafter to the s and a branches of time - periodic solutions .",
    "in this section , we identify the relevant , previously discussed periodic orbits by numerically solving in the fourier space the dynamical equations set ( [ eqn9])-([eqn10 ] ) .",
    "we have considered the two cases of @xmath99 , with @xmath100 corresponding to the soft potential , while @xmath101 corresponds to the hard potential case .",
    "we analyze the properties of phase - symmetric ( s ) and phase - anti - symmetric ( a ) solutions , characterized respectively by the following properties :    @xmath102    or , in terms of the fourier coefficients :    @xmath103    it is worth remarking that for @xmath40 , the solutions are time - reversible and , consequently , we select @xmath104 .",
    "we recall that in the hamiltonian limit , the rwa predicts that the s ( a ) solution becomes unstable at @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) in the soft ( hard ) case , giving rise to an asymmetric ( as ) solution . for the particular case of @xmath107 ,",
    "the results for the soft case are shown ( for @xmath40 ) in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : asym ] , while those for the hard potential case are shown in the right panel of the figure ( for @xmath108 ) .",
    "the solid lines of the direct numerical computation appear to have good agreement with the dashed lines of the rwa , as regards the predicted amplitudes of the asymmetric node equilibrium values , at least near the bifurcation point .",
    "interestingly , this agreement is _ considerably better _ in the hard case than in the soft nonlinearity case .",
    "this will be a continuous theme within the results that follow , i.e. , we will see that the hard case is generally very accurately described by the rwa ( even in the presence of gain / loss ) , while the soft case is only well approximated sufficiently close to the linear limit .",
    "it should be noted that a fundamental difference between the nonlinear schrdinger type dimer and the @xmath109 oscillator one is expected as the amplitude of the solution increases ( and so does the deviation from the symmetry breaking point ) . in particular , the former model due to its norm conservation",
    "does _ not _ feature finite time collapse ( or any type of infinite growth for that matter when @xmath40 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the latter model has the potential for finite time collapse when the amplitude of the nodes exceeds the unit height of the potential ( see a detailed analysis of this `` escape '' phenomenology in the recent work of  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is thus rather natural that the two models should _ significantly _ deviate from each other as this parameter range is approached .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the present work , we have considered a prototypical example of a @xmath0-symmetric dimer in the context of coupled nonlinear oscillators .",
    "we explored how the behavior of the hamiltonian limit of the system is modified in the presence of the gain / loss parameter @xmath5 which plays a significant role in the dynamics .",
    "we were able to quantify the existence , stability and nonlinear dynamics of the model numerically by means of a newton solver identifying periodic orbits , coupled to a floquet exponent computation , as well as a time - stepper of the system s evolution .",
    "we also provided a useful theoretical approximation to the relevant features by means of a schrdinger dimer via the rotating wave approximation but also delineated the limitations of such an approach . through the combination of these tools",
    ", we observed how symmetric and anti - symmetric periodic orbits bifurcate from a quantifiable linear limit , how they become unstable through symmetry - breaking bifurcations and finally how they terminate in a nonlinear analog of the @xmath0 transition .",
    "while most of these features could be theoretically understood by means of our ( linear and nonlinear rwa ) analysis , we also revealed a set of effects _ particular _ to the oscillator system , such as the possibility for escape and finite time collapse in the case of soft nonlinearity , as well as the potential for destabilization of _ both _ branches ( rather than just the single one suggested by rwa ) .",
    "we also explained the regime where the rwa was expected to be most efficient ( i.e. , for parameters proximal to the bifurcation from the linear limit ) and where more significant deviations should be expected , most notably e.g. for much smaller frequencies @xmath37 in the soft potential case .",
    "this work , we believe , paves the way for a number of future considerations in the context of oscillator problems with @xmath0 symmetry . while in the schrdinger context",
    ", numerous studies have addressed the large / infinite number of nodes limit  @xcite , this is far less so the case in the context of oscillators where this analysis is really at a nascent stage . in such lattice contexts , it would be of particular interest to consider genuine breather type solutions in the form of exponentially localized in space and periodic in time orbits .",
    "once such structures are identified systematically in the context of 1d settings , it would also be natural to extend consideration to higher dimensional plaquettes  @xcite and lattices , where more complex patterns ( including discrete vortices among others  @xcite ) are known to be possible .",
    "such studies are currently in progress and will be reported in future publications .",
