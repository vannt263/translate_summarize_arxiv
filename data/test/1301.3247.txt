    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) allows for various types of hadrons .",
    "first , the meson and baryon spectra computed from either constituent models @xcite or lattice simulations @xcite in @xmath3-dimensions were found to be in very good agreement with the experimental spectra @xcite . beside these conventional hadrons , qcd does not forbid the existence of other exotic resonances like glueballs , hybrid mesons , tetra- and penta - quarks , etc .",
    "it is worth commenting a bit the current situation concerning glueballs , since the present works is devoted to that peculiar kind of exotic hadrons .",
    "the lightest glueballs are expected to mix significantly with conventional states @xcite ; hence their experimental identification is a challenging task and no firm glueball candidate is known yet @xcite .",
    "constituent and other effective models can in principle drive experimental searches by providing calculations of the glueball mass spectrum and of their preferred decay channels , while lattice qcd , being formulated in euclidean space - time can only provide the mass spectrum @xcite . in",
    "that sense constituent models are more powerful that numerical simulations , but they rely on the rather strong hypothesis that a relativistic bound state can be approximated by a fixed number of constituents ( quark and/or gluons ) interacting through an instantaneous potential .    the main assumption of constituent approaches is readily justified for quarks : the heavy quarks are heavy enough for an expansion in @xmath4 to be relevant @xcite , while light quarks are known to develop an effective mass @xmath5 mev at low energy @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for glueballs .",
    "the gluon mass generation was postulated long time ago @xcite but received support from numerical simulations only recently @xcite .",
    "after @xcite , it has been claimed that glueballs could be described by a constituent picture thanks to this dynamically generated gluon mass @xcite . in the @xmath3-dimensional case",
    ", it turned out that the constituent model spectrum matches the lattice one provided that the glueball wave function is built from the transverse degrees of freedom of the constituent gluons only @xcite . the gluonic longitudinal component inherent to massive vector particles actually decouples for physical observables thanks to current conservation @xcite .    because of the obvious connection with experimental data , glueball properties have mostly been studied within a @xmath3-dimensional spacetime",
    "however , some results are known in @xmath0-dimensions , a case that is particularly relevant mostly for two reasons .",
    "first , decreasing the number of spatial dimensions can significantly reduce the computational effort in lattice calculations and serve as a toy model for the @xmath3-dimensional theory .",
    "second , the spectrum of a yang - mills gauge theory with two spatial dimensions exhibits peculiar features , that will be detailed below , and whose understanding is intrinsically challenging .",
    "the glueball spectrum in @xmath0-dimensions has been computed in @xcite for the gauge group su(@xmath1 ) , and the lowest - lying states have been studied with so(@xmath2 ) in @xcite .    to our knowledge",
    ", the structure of the @xmath0-@xmath6 glueball spectrum has not been studied yet by resorting to constituent approaches . as shown by lattice computations ,",
    "the gluon propagator reaches a finite value in the infrared in @xmath0-@xmath6 as well @xcite .",
    "a constituent model should then be also appropriate to describe the glueball spectrum obtained in numerical simulations .",
    "this study aims precisely at this and is organized as follows : the basic features of a constituent picture are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : cons ] with the numerical technique used to solve the eigenequations associated .",
    "the two- , three- and four - gluon bound states are then studied in the su(@xmath1 ) case in secs .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] respectively .",
    "the extension of our formalism to arbitrary gauge groups is presented in sec .",

    "in @xmath7 dimensions , the gauge field has @xmath8 independent components because of gauge invariance and transversality . in @xmath9 ,",
    "only one component is left .",
    "so , at the level of our model , a constituent gluon will be seen as a  scalar \" particle in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , with an intrinsic parity equal to @xmath10 . as explained in the introduction",
    ", gluon mass generation suggests that a constituent description of glueball states may be relevant .",
    "any glueball state can then be interpreted as a bound state of a given number ( @xmath11 ) of interacting constituent gluons .",
    "the interaction being confining , one should in a first approximation be able to label the various states by a harmonic oscillator band number related to some jacobi coordinates : @xmath12 and assume that , for the lightest states at least , the mass @xmath13 is @xmath14 . in the above definition , @xmath15 is the eigenvalue of the two - dimensional angular momentum related to the @xmath16th jacobi coordinate , namely @xmath17 .",
    "physical states are then characterized by a spin @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the parity @xmath21 is defined as the operation @xmath22 @xcite : it is crucial to note that @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the state @xmath24 has the parity @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . the case @xmath27 needs to be separately considered . under the reasonable assumption that the hamiltonian of the theory commutes with the parity operator ,",
    "the states @xmath28 have the same mass .",
    "this is a characteristic signature of @xmath0-dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "note that , in @xmath0-@xmath6 , it is in general convenient to use the complex coordinates @xmath29 instead of the cartesian ones .",
    "the spin operator then reads @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , and the parity acts as a complex conjugation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath32 .    in the following",
    ", we will need to solve two- and three - body relativistic @xmath0-@xmath6 eigenequations . a full numerical three - body calculation in this case",
    "is out of the scope of this exploratory work , but one can nevertheless resort to a semiclassical mass formula in order to get a correct estimate of the mass spectrum .",
    "we will use an extended version of the dominantly orbital state ( dos ) method developed at the origin for two - body @xmath3-@xmath6 hadronic systems @xcite .",
    "it can be generalized to treat three - body system with an arbitrary kinetic part for any number of dimensions @xcite .",
    "the idea is to quantize the radial excitations around classical circular orbits with quantized angular momentum . in principle ,",
    "accurate results can only be computed for small radial excitations and high orbital excitation , but it can be shown that very good results can be obtained for the whole spectra in the cases of two- and three - body relativistic systems with linear interactions @xcite . a particularity for @xmath0-@xmath6 systems is the impossibility to use the dos method to treat states with a vanishing total orbital momentum , but then a wkb computation can be used instead @xcite .",
    "the charge conjugation of a color - singlet bound state of two constituent gluons is always positive : a color wave function like @xmath33 is such that @xmath34 .",
    "note that this is valid whatever the gauge group since one can always construct the invariant tensor @xmath35 .    to establish the allowed @xmath36 , we recall that the various glueball wave functions can be expressed in a harmonic oscillator basis , for which analytical computations are particularly straightforward .",
    "let @xmath37 be the relative ( spatial ) coordinate between the two constituent gluons .",
    "then , in a harmonic oscillator basis , the spatial wave function of any two gluon state has the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a polynomial in @xmath40 , whose degree is related to the energy level of the considered state .",
    "the spin is given by the eigenvalue of @xmath41 , so @xmath27 states must be functions of the product @xmath42 only . since @xmath21 interchanges @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the parity of these scalar states is positive .",
    "the pauli principle has finally to be imposed and the state must be symmetrized  constituent gluons are indeed bosons . by definition ,",
    "@xmath45 , so the scalar states are symmetric .",
    "one sees that @xmath46 generates a tower of @xmath47 glueballs at the energy level @xmath48 . in the following",
    ", @xmath49 will always denote the term with the highest degree in the corresponding polynomial and the dots , denoting the terms with lower degrees , will be dropped .",
    "higher spin states can be built by using @xmath50 , generating a glueball at energy level @xmath51 .",
    "however , only even values of @xmath52 ensure a totally symmetric state : the allowed two - gluon glueball quantum numbers are finally @xmath47 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ,  as observed on the lattice @xcite , the scalar and tensor glueballs are indeed the lightest states , which is natural in view of the present approach : they are made of a minimal number of constituent gluons . as observed in table",
    "[ tab ] , the mass hierarchy of the lightest sates observed on the lattice fits in the classification developed above .",
    "the harmonic oscillator degeneracy is broken since the underlying dynamical model is not expected to be a nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "we remark that no @xmath55 two - gluon bound state can be formed ; this was not the case in @xmath3-@xmath6 .",
    "the pseudoscalar glueball is thus expected to be well heavier than the scalar one , as observed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "let us first compare our approach to the large-@xmath1 limit of the lattice results since the coupling between states with different number of gluons is expected to vanish at large @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the simplest model able to describe a bound state of two constituent gluons is the hamiltonian @xmath56 where we allow for a gluon mass @xmath57 and where we assume the casimir scaling of the string tension , @xmath58 in the above equation , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the quadratic casimir operator for the gluon ( quark ) and @xmath61 is the fundamental string tension .",
    "the one - gluon - exchange potential has been neglected : in @xmath0-@xmath6 , it is proportional to @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is some constant .",
    "such a potential being weakly confining , its influence is expected to be similar to that of the linearly confining term .",
    "so it should not be as crucial as the coulomb form in @xmath3-@xmath6 .",
    "the large-@xmath1 limit of our model reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are dimensionless conjugate variables .",
    "the free parameter is @xmath67 , that we set equal to @xmath68 .",
    "the agreement between our model and the lattice data of @xcite can be appraised in table [ tab ] : it is very satisfactory with respect to the simplicity of our approach . as mentioned before , the numerical results have been obtained thanks the dos method @xcite .",
    "they have been checked by the use of lagrange - mesh method @xcite which can be easily extended to @xmath0-@xmath6 systems while preserving its high accuracy .",
    "a fit of the mass spectrum in the large-@xmath1 limit shows that the masses of the @xmath69 states , that have @xmath70 quantum numbers , are located on the regge trajectory @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this compares favorably with the lattice result @xmath74 , @xmath75 , found in @xcite .",
    "such a regge trajectory may be seen as the two - dimensional equivalent of the pomeron .",
    "with any gauge group , a totally antisymmetric color singlet can be made from three constituent gluons , which has a positive charge conjugation : it is realized through a coupling involving the structure constants @xmath76 . in the special case of su(@xmath77 ) , the totally symmetric invariant tensors @xmath78 can be used to build a totally symmetric color singlet from three constituent gluons , with a negative charge conjugation @xcite .",
    "the pauli principle demands the spatial wave function to be totally ( anti)symmetrized for @xmath79 three - gluon glueballs .",
    "if the problem of writing correctly symmetrized quantum three - gluon states is not fully solved yet in @xmath3-@xmath6 ( a formal procedure can be found in @xcite ) , the reduction of gluonic degrees of freedom will allow an explicit determination of these states in @xmath0-@xmath6 .",
    "we closely follow here ref .",
    "@xcite , where a straightforward method to generate two - dimensional harmonic oscillator states is presented and applied to explicitly build all states with a well - defined permutation symmetry up to the @xmath80 band in our notation .",
    "one first defines the jacobi coordinates @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and then works with the coordinates @xmath83 .",
    "this is convenient because the action of the parity operator and of the permutation operators on these four coordinates is straightforwardly computed @xcite .    in a harmonic oscillator basis ,",
    "the spatial wave function of any three gluon state has the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a polynomial in @xmath86 .",
    "totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric polynomials can then be built and , by linear combination , one can obtain polynomials that are also eigenstates of @xmath87 and of the parity ( @xmath88 ) . for the parity",
    ", one has to recall that the intrinsic negative parity of the constituent gluons adds a global minus sign to the result .",
    "the terms with the highest degree of the functions @xmath85 leading to given glueball states are listed in table [ tab2 ] . as expected ,",
    "selection rules arise because of symmetrization , and the allowed quantum numbers we find perfectly match those found on the lattice .",
    "a first observation is that the lightest state is a @xmath89 one , such that @xmath90 , in agreement with a constituent gluon picture .",
    "a second observation is that a @xmath55 state is at first present in the @xmath91 band : this is an indication that the splitting between the scalar and pseudoscalar states has to be large , as observed on the lattice .",
    "a last observation is that no @xmath92 state can be formed with three constituent gluons .",
    "indeed , the negative charge conjugation asks for a totally symmetric state for color and space .",
    "as can be observed from @xcite , any @xmath93 three - body state must have a negative parity .",
    "so this glueball is at least a four - gluon one .",

    "our two - body model can be generalized to a three - body case . in a flux - tube picture",
    ", the static potential describing three adjoint sources has a @xmath95-shape as far as su(@xmath1 ) is chosen @xcite : the gluons are linked by fundamental strings , and the hamiltonian reads @xmath96 , whose large-@xmath1 limit is @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are dimensionless conjugate variables .    the mass spectrum of hamiltonian  ( [ h3b ] ) is given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "masses of three - gluon glueballs have been computed with the dos method .",
    "the mass of the @xmath89 states can also be straightforwardly obtained by performing variational computations with gaussian trial wave functions of the type @xmath100 . applying techniques similar to those of @xcite in the case of two spatial dimensions , one obtains for example the upper bound @xmath101 , with a size @xmath102 .",
    "this value is actually close to our semiclassical estimates , as are the masses found for the @xmath103 and @xmath104 glueballs .",
    "this is another check of the validity of the dos approximation scheme .",
    "it can be observed that , although a quantitative agreement is not reached , the trend of the spectrum is correctly reproduced .",
    "remark that the @xmath55 glueball is the only state for which our estimate is clearly incompatible with the lattice result .",
    "its overestimation might be the result of a lack of precision in the prediction of the three - body radial slope , which affects more severely this @xmath105 state .",
    "the masses of the @xmath69 eigenstates of ( [ h3b ] ) with @xmath106 are located on the regge trajectory @xmath71 , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "such a low intercept , together with a slope similar to but lower than the two - gluon case , has also been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "as previously said , the @xmath92 glueball has to be made of at least four gluons . to estimate its mass , we follow a procedure similar to what has been done in @xcite . according to the results of this last reference ( that have been obtained for su(3 ) but that are valid for su(@xmath1 ) too ) ,",
    "a color singlet four gluon state with @xmath109 should have a spatial symmetry of the form @xmath110 .",
    "there are thus two totally antisymmetric two - gluon clusters : this can be reached by a @xmath111 two - gluon wave function of the form @xmath112 . in the flux tube picture , where two fundamental strings originate from each constituent gluon , the mass of such a cluster is equal to @xmath113 in units of @xmath114 .",
    "the quantum state of the clusters being known , we can couple them in order to obtain a @xmath92 state . in order to satisfy at best the mixed symmetry of the four - gluon state ,",
    "we ask for the two clusters to be identical and for the two - cluster state to be the lightest @xmath27 state . the glueball mass computed this way",
    "is 10.11 in units of @xmath114 : although being a seemingly rough estimate , it is in good agreement with the lattice result 9.47(116 ) @xcite .",

    "nonperturbative effects generate a nonzero gluon mass in @xmath0-@xmath6 yang - mills theory , which is computed from the zero - momentum limit of the gluon propagator .",
    "a fit to lattice results in landau gauge leads to @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xmath0-@xmath6 , one can compute that the string tension is given by @xmath118 @xcite . combining both results",
    "leads to @xmath119 , or @xmath120 .",
    "note that , in the large-@xmath1 limit , @xmath121 and we get @xmath122 , a value perfectly matching the one we used to reproduce at best the low - lying glueball spectrum .    from this discussion we can conclude that @xmath123 should be a gauge - group independent quantity and that the masses of the two - gluon glueballs should obey a simple scaling law .",
    "in particular , we expect @xmath124 with @xmath125 a gauge - group - independent constant that we compute to be equal to @xmath126 for the lightest @xmath47 glueball .",
    "equivalently , we expect the glueball masses normalized to @xmath127 to be gauge - group independent .",
    "the recent lattice work @xcite provides us a way to check this last equation since the behavior of the scalar glueball in @xmath0-@xmath6 versus @xmath1 has been computed for both su(@xmath1 ) and so(@xmath2 ) .",

    "only one constituent gluon is then necessary to form a color singlet . in this case , the hamiltonian is @xmath130 , whose lightest eigenstate ( a @xmath89 one ) has a mass equal to @xmath131 for su(2 ) , still with @xmath68 , while we find the lightest glueball to have a mass @xmath132 for su(2 ) .",
    "this can be compared to the lattice study @xcite , where is has been found that , in su(2 ) computations , the link between the adjoint string breaking length scale and the lightest glueball mass is @xmath133 .",
