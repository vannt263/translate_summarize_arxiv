    "intellectual rivalries , contests , intrigues , and priority disputes were particularly frequent and acrimonious at a time when scientific publication was in its infancy and savants still depended on aristocratic patronage.@xcite in his notorious and unedifying disputes with hooke,@xcite flamsteed,@xcite and leibniz,@xcite newton did have legitimate grievances .",
    "those controversies generated more heat than others of the period primarily because of the greater significance of the scientific work involved.@xcite    in his lifetime , newton s `` natural philosophy '' withstood many attacks , most of them misguided and some of them malicious.@xcite in the fraught intellectual climate of the period , those controversies threatened to spill into religious and political disputes that could have cost newton his livelihood and reputation.@xcite newton s guardedness in publishing and explaining his discoveries , as well as his prickly defense of his honor when faced with criticism , do not seem quite so peculiar or paranoid in their historical context .",
    "had he not enjoyed restoration england s relative freedom of thought and , from an early age , the security of his cambridge professorship , it is hard to see how his revolutionary work could have been accomplished .    in evaluating newton s character , one should also bear in mind that during the last thirty years of his life he served as chief officer of the royal mint , earning nearly unanimous praise for his diligence and honesty . according to mint official and historian sir john craig , newton was not only personally conscientious but also `` a good judge and handler of men , '' endowed with `` magnetism which in many engendered an extraordinary regard and respect.''@xcite in the estimation of the eminent economist lord keynes , newton was `` one of the greatest and most efficient of our civil servants.''@xcite newton s efforts to improve the coinage contributed significantly to the nation s finances.@xcite after his appointment to the mint had made him a wealthy man , he became known to his extended family and to others for his charitable giving.@xcite",
    "[ sec : occult ]    keynes had acquired many of newton s private manuscripts.@xcite he was therefore aware of the great scientist s interests in both alchemy and theology , leading him to declare in 1946 that newton had not been `` the first of the age of reason '' but rather `` the last of the magicians.''@xcite scholars have since debated whether newton s alchemical and religious pursuits are properly characterized as `` magical '' and how they relate to his work in physics and mathematics .",
    "the mature newton showed no interest in astrology,@xcite communication with spirits , ritual magic , or other of the common occult pursuits of the day.@xcite the editor of newton s mathematical papers , d.  t.  whiteside , could find `` no hint of any belief by him in number - mysticism,''@xcite while recent scholarship has documented newton s hostility to neo - platonism , gnosticism , kabbalism and other esoteric traditions influential in the renaissance.@xcite    newton s private writings do evince a keen involvement with alchemy and its arcane imagery , but at the time there was no clear boundary between alchemy as mysticism and alchemy as early modern chemistry .",
    "moreover , the otherworldliness of alchemy as practiced in newton s day may have been exaggerated by 19th - century occultists and those influenced by their interpretations.@xcite newton s alchemical interests , which he shared with eminent contemporaries such as robert boyle and john locke , undoubtedly influenced his atomism.@xcite on the other hand , the notion that alchemy contributed to his conception of gravity as an action at a distance may be , according to the most recent scholarship , `` something of a canard.''@xcite    leibniz , who rejected the newtonian theory of gravity , originated the claim that newton conceived of gravity as an `` occult quality , '' an aspersion that newton strenuously denied.@xcite explaining that he did not `` feign hypotheses '' about the mechanism by which gravity acted across empty space , newton presented his theory as a mathematical description of gravity s observable effects , an attitude wholly compatible with modern scientific principles.@xcite according to a tradition collected by voltaire , when the elderly newton was asked how he had discovered his celebrated law of universal gravitation , he replied : `` by thinking on it continually.''@xcite",
    "[ sec : religion ]    [ t ]    newton was a devout but unorthodox christian who privately rejected the doctrines of the holy trinity@xcite and the immortality of the soul as unscriptural and idolatrous.@xcite he dedicated a considerable effort to establishing a chronology of human civilization , combining his belief in the wisdom of the ancients and in the historicity of the bible with innovative uses of astronomy and other quantitative techniques.@xcite a failure from the standpoint of our current understanding of history , that work does shed light on newton s attitudes towards the various branches of learning .",
    "philosopher richard popkin tried to make theology the key to newton s intellectual development , provocatively asking why `` one of the greatest anti - trinitarian theologians of the 17th century '' took `` time off to write works on natural science , like the _ principia mathematica_?''@xcite but the fact that , in due course , newton s mathematics and physics were decisively embraced by an international community of scholars , the vast majority of whom were either ignorant of his religious convictions or actively hostile to them , suggests that newton s theology can contribute little to elucidating the _ content _ of his science.@xcite even newton s belief that divine intervention is needed to keep the planets on their regular orbits as theologically charged a claim about nature as he ever published@xcite was based on the mathematical laws of gravity that he had abstracted from astronomical observations , and the problem that he thereby raised , the dynamical stability of the solar system , has continued to occupy physicists and mathematicians to this day.@xcite    in my view , if there is something to learn today from newton s religion , and more broadly from his life beyond his immortal work in the exact sciences , it is a lesson close to max weber s `` elective affinities '' between the worldview associated with certain historical strands of protestant christianity , and the scientific and industrial revolutions.@xcite according to historian stephen snobelen , `` in his biblicism , piety and morality , newton was a puritan through and through.''@xcite the central paradox of newton s life is close to what weber underlined in his analysis of the growth of capitalism : that the puritans , whose convictions seem so remote from our perspective , contributed decisively to creating the modern world.@xcite in the context of the radical english puritanism of the 17th century of the religion of oliver cromwell , john milton , and the pilgrim fathers the man isaac newton gains some intelligibility.@xcite    puritanism and its legacy have long been contentious in english - language historiography , as reflected , for instance , in the widely diverging evaluations of oliver cromwell s rule.@xcite newton",
    "s own ( doctrinally heterodox ) puritanism may account , in part , for the antipathy of some of his biographers .",

    "[ sec : knight ]    [ t ]    on 16 april 1705 , in a ceremony conducted at trinity college , cambridge , queen anne elevated isaac newton to the rank of knight bachelor.@xcite at the time , that honor was usually granted to military officers and senior figures in the national and local governments , as well as to rich merchants and others with political connections.@xcite newton s knighthood was probably a royal favor to his political patron , lord halifax .",
    "halifax , a prominent figure in the whig political party , hoped thereby to promote newton s candidacy in the upcoming parliamentary election , but newton came last at the polls and never again sought elective office.@xcite    the lawyer james montagu ( lord halifax s brother and a future attorney general ) and the academic john ellis ( master of gonville and caius college and vice - chancellor of the university of cambridge ) were knighted along with newton .",
    "more than a few `` new men '' of obscure ancestry , like ellis , figure among the knights bachelor created by queen anne.@xcite for his part , sir isaac soon sought to establish his status as a gentleman.@xcite in november he submitted to the college of heralds an affidavit detailing his ancestry and claiming sir john newton , bart.,@xcite a rich landowner from culverthorpe , in lincolnshire , as a third cousin .",
    "this was supported by a declaration signed by sir john.@xcite    that genealogy might seem suspicious , since isaac newton s father had been a relatively prosperous but illiterate yeoman farmer.@xcite it was not uncommon , in that day and age , for a wealthy man to pay an accommodating officer for the right to bear a coat of arms , or to some other hereditary privilege , based on a fictional pedigree .",
    "in fact , the second sir john newton , bart .",
    "( father of the cousin who supported isaac newton s affidavit ) had inherited his baronetcy from a sir john newton to whom he was unrelated .",
    "the first sir john , a native of gloucestershire , was childless .",
    "he agreed to pass on his baronetcy to his rich namesake and putative cousin , resident in lincolnshire , in exchange for help settling his financial obligations . but",
    "archival research has established that the genealogy in isaac newton s 1705 affidavit is genuine and that he prepared it from the available records with his habitual scrupulousness.@xcite    according to accounts collected by sir david brewster , later in his life newton claimed in private conversation that his male - line ancestry might have been scottish.@xcite yet it seems quite unlikely that newton could have seriously entertained that idea , which contradicts the well - documented genealogy that he had submitted to the college of heralds .",
    "moreover , it is clear from their mutual correspondence that isaac newton consistently regarded sir john newton as head of their common clan .",
    "sir john s heir , the rich and politically connected sir michael newton , would serve as chief mourner at isaac newton s funeral in 1727.@xcite",
    "[ sec : blazon ]    [ t ]    isaac newton s personal coat of arms is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cambridge ] .",
    "this escutcheon is carved on a stone tablet above the front door of woolsthorpe manor , the home in woolsthorpe - by - colsterworth , near grantham , lincolnshire , where newton was born and where he made some of his greatest intellectual breakthroughs after returning there when the university of cambridge was closed due to the great plague of 166566 .",
    "that tablet , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : woolsthorpe ] , was installed in 1798 by edmund turnor , whose father had purchased woolsthorpe manor in 1733.@xcite    in the language of heraldry , fig .",
    "[ fig : cambridge ] is described ( `` blazoned '' ) as `` sable , two shinbones in saltire , the dexter surmounted of the sinister argent . '' this requires some explanation for the uninitiated : `` sable '' means black and refers to the background color .",
    "a `` saltire '' is an x - shaped cross .",
    "`` argent '' means white and identifies to the color of the bones .",
    "the `` sinister '' bone ( which runs from the upper right to the lower left ) surmounts the `` dexter '' ( running from the upper left to the lower right ) .",
    "the last detail is interesting .",
    "the reader may care to verify that the crossbones of fig .",
    "[ fig : cambridge ] are arranged like the blades of a pair of left - handed scissors .",
    "even with symmetrical handles , ordinary ( i.e. , right - handed ) scissors can not be turned so that they will be congruent with fig .  [",

    "[ fig : barrs ] .",
    "the design of fig .",
    "[ fig : cambridge ] is therefore unequivocally left - handed , or , to use the latin term , _",
    "sinister_.    the blazon to which isaac newton was entitled by virtue of the genealogy in the 1705 affidavit did not specify which bone should lie on top.@xcite the arms of the newton baronets show the dexter bone surmounting the sinister ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : barrs]).@xcite on the other hand , samuel newton ( 16281718 ) , mayor of cambridge , who was unrelated to sir isaac but with whom sir isaac must have become acquainted during his years at the university , displayed his own coat of arms with the sinister bone surmounting the dexter.@xcite    the coat of arms of isaac barrow , newton s mentor and predecessor as lucasian professor of mathematics , also features a sinister saltire , in his case formed by two crossed swords .",
    "an ornate carving of it , by the eminent artist grinling gibbons , graces the end of a bookshelf in trinity college s wren library , built while barrow was master and newton a fellow of that college.@xcite",
    "[ sec : symbolism ]    like other aspects of his life , newton s heraldry resists easy interpretation .",
    "newton did not create the crossbone device , which is ancestral . on the other hand",
    ", one might attribute some meaning to his adoption of such a stark design ( which only a couple of decades later would become indelibly associated with the jolly roger by the pseudonymous captain charles johnson s _ general history of pyrates_@xcite ) , rather than seeking a new grant of arms from the college of heralds ( which he might well have obtained , given his eminence ) .",
    "newton s efforts to uncover factual accounts of history and natural science concealed in ancient sources , such as the bible , greek myths , or the _ corpus hermeticum _ , were surely related to the `` emblematic worldview '' of other renaissance intellectuals who sought wisdom by deciphering and correlating the symbolisms that they believed lay hidden in all things .",
    "but , as matt goldish has underlined , `` newton s relationship to symbols was not mystical , like that of the rosicrucians or other hermetics , but rather mathematical : he regarded them as a puzzle for which available clues provide a logical solution.''@xcite    in his study of ancient sources , newton always sought precise , rational meanings that he thought had been obfuscated after the corruption of mankind s first religion.@xcite the alchemical literature of his day , with its deliberate encoding of chemical recipes in riddling allegories,@xcite must have encouraged that approach .",
    "scholars who have taken seriously the characterization of newton as `` last of the magicians '' have tended to downplay this _ disenchanting _ tendency , as well as his consistent rejection of metaphysical speculation divorced from rigorous experimental knowledge.@xcite    with this in mind , three non - exclusive possibilities for newton s interpretation of his own escutcheon appear plausible : as a conventional mark of his social rank and family connections , as a stark _ memento mori _ like the skulls and hourglasses of puritan gravestones,@xcite or as a mathematical symbol connected to what would much later be called _ chirality_. though wholly conjectural , the last possibility is intriguing in light of other intellectual developments .",
    "[ sec : chirality ]    an object is said to be chiral if it can not be superimposed on its mirror image .",
    "the term , coined by lord kelvin in 1893,@xcite is taken from the greek word for hand ( @xmath0 ) , the human hands being familiar instances of chiral objects : the left and right hands are mirror images of each other , and a left - hand glove will not fit over a right hand , or vice - versa .",
    "some 19th - century mathematical scientists , including clerk maxwell and willard gibbs , referred to the geometrical transformation that replaces a figure with its mirror image as a `` perversion,''@xcite a usage that is now largely obsolete but persists in some scientific contexts.@xcite    awareness of the incongruence of mirror images is much older .",
    "modern chemists often credit ren descartes ( 15961650 ) with this insight , based on the remark attributed to him that `` any man who , upon looking down at his bare feet , does not laugh , has either no sense of symmetry or no sense of humor.''@xcite i have been unable to find this quote in descartes s published works or correspondence , but descartes did have a sophisticated understanding of what would later be termed chirality , for he famously explained magnetism as a flow of tiny particles shaped as left - handed or right - handed corkscrews , whose mutual action could therefore produce either attraction of repulsion.@xcite newton rejected such _ ad hoc _ , unverifiable hypotheses as `` fictions.''@xcite but when it came to the double refraction ( now called birefringence ) exhibited by crystals of iceland spar , newton proposed an interpretation in terms of the `` sides '' of light.@xcite ( these `` sides , '' akin to the linear polarizations of modern physical optics , are not chiral . )",
    "did descartes s interest in the incongruence of mirror images influence newton ?",
    "though i have found no direct evidence of this , the possibility is not far - fetched .",
    "newton was both descartes s greatest disciple and his greatest critic . in the words of mathematician and science historian clifford truesdell , `` if the steely - splendid preface to the _ principia _ is not just a bolt from the blue ( and where in science as such bolts to be found ? ) , who else than descartes can be its grandsire?''@xcite      [ sec : rightful ]    the young newton first came to the attention of the `` republic of letters '' as creator of the first practical reflecting telescope.@xcite an issue that might have caught newton s attention is how a telescope can alter an image s orientation .",
    "galileo s old refracting telescope leaves orientation unchanged , but kepler s improved refractor rotates it by 180@xmath1 .",
    "the image can be made upright by reflection ( a desirable feature when observing objects on land ) , at the cost of reversing left and right .",
    "newton s telescope used a pair of mirrors , one curved , the other flat .",
    "each mirror reverses chirality , but the net effect is that the image is rotated while chirality is preserved .    in his later years , newton had further occasion to consider the incongruence of mirror images when he sought to estimate the date of the expedition of the argonauts from what he took to be a contemporaneous description of the positions of the equinoxes and solstices with respect to the constellations .",
    "in the course of that work , newton had to correct for inconsistencies in the chiralities of constellations as drawn in stellar atlases .",
    "he referred to the corrected stellar maps as being `` rightly delineated , '' confusing some of his critics.@xcite the reason for those inconsistencies is that constellations may be depicted as they are actually seen from the earth or as they would appear on the surface of a celestial globe ( i.e. , from an imaginary vantage point outside the celestial sphere).@xcite      [ sec : philosophy ]    [ t ]    in 1768 , immanuel kant considered chirality ( which he called the problem of `` incongruent counterparts '' ) in the context of the philosophical debate on whether the concept of space is reducible to the relations between concrete objects.@xcite this was a question that dated back to the disputes between newton and leibniz.@xcite kant argued that the spatial relations between the fingers of a given hand are the same whether it be a left or a right hand and that the fact that the two hands are distinguishable must therefore be explained by appeal to an external geometrical space in which the hands exist . according to kant , this supported newton s belief in the existence of an absolute space , which leibniz had denied.@xcite    chirality figures also in ludwig wittgenstein s _ tractatus logico - philosophicus _ of 1921 .",
    "wittgenstein pointed out that a right - hand glove could be worn over a left hand if the three - dimensional glove could be turned around in a fourth spatial dimension.@xcite ( an equivalent observation had been made by mathematician august mbius in 1827.@xcite ) wittgenstein s comment is characteristically gnomic , but he seems to have concluded from this that chirality is tied to the space in which the object is embedded ( and therefore to the ways in which it is allowed to move ) rather than being a property of the object itself.@xcite      [ sec : chemistry ]    [ t ]    the young louis pasteur , who had just completed his doctorate in chemistry and physics , was faced with a puzzle .",
    "he knew that @xmath2-tartaric acid , extracted from fermented grape juice , is optically active ( meaning that it rotates the plane of the polarization of light passing through it ) .",
    "factory - made `` paratartaric acid '' ( now called racemic tartaric acid ) has the same elemental composition as @xmath2-tartaric acid , yet crystallizes differently and is optically inactive . in 1848",
    ", pasteur discovered that the artificially synthesized acid could make two distinct crystals , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tartrate ] , which are mirror images of each other .",
    "by carefully picking out crystals of one form and dissolving them , he produced a substance identical to the natural @xmath2-tartaric acid.@xcite    pasteur s work established that racemic tartaric acid is a mixture of two substances whose molecules are mirror images of each other ( `` enantiomers '' ) , and that only one of the two forms occurs in nature .",
    "a decade afterwards , his experiments on tartrate fermentation led pasteur to conclude that chirality is an essential factor in molecular recognition within biological systems.@xcite pasteur s brilliant elucidation of molecular chirality would play a key role in the growth of biochemistry . writing a century later , the great crystallographer and molecular biologist j.  d.  bernal described it as pasteur s `` first and in some ways his greatest scientific discovery.''@xcite    pasteur saw deep significance in the homochirality of biomolecules , writing that `` life as manifested to us is a consequence of the dissymmetry of the universe.''@xcite why life on earth evolved to use only one enantiomer of such organic substances as amino acids and sugars remains mysterious.@xcite      [ sec : particle ]    in 1956 , theoretical physicists t.  d.  lee and c.  n.  yang proposed that the weak nuclear interaction , unlike the other forces of nature , could distinguish between mirror images . soon afterwards , c.  s.  wu confirmed this experimentally when she found that in radioactive decays of cobalt-60 nuclei the electron produced is more likely to be emitted in a direction opposite to the nucleus s intrinsic angular momentum ( `` spin '' ) , making the decay process left - handed.@xcite    a measurement of the spin of a massless particle along the direction of its linear momentum has only two possible outcomes , which are mirror images of each other and are therefore called chiralities . for the photon ( the massless particle of light ) , these correspond to its two circular polarizations.@xcite elementary particles that do have mass ( such as the electron ) are now regarded as mixtures of the two chiralities.@xcite    the weak interaction acts exclusively on the left - handed component of particles and on the right - handed component of antiparticles . the standard model ( sm ) of high energy physics is therefore formulated in terms of chiral quantum fields.@xcite in 1964 , cronin and fitch reported experimental evidence that there is also a slight asymmetry between the interactions of left - handed particles and right - handed antiparticles . in 1973 ,",
    "kobayashi and maskawa showed how this effect , known as `` charge - parity '' ( cp ) violation , was possible within the theoretical context of the sm .",
    "the amount of cp violation in the sm is , however , far too small to explain why the universe contains as much matter as it does , but no antimatter . how cp violation in the early universe can have been large enough to account for the matter content that we see today",
    "is one of the great unsolved problems of both cosmology and particle physics.@xcite",
    "[ sec : armiger ]    [ t ]    like other wealthy armigers of the period , sir isaac had his coat of arms painted on the doors of his carriage .",
    "a french commentator mistook it for a `` death s head '' and interpreted it as evidence that newton whose christian convictions were problematic for the free - thinking _ philosophes _ who embraced his science had `` entirely taken to religion '' in his old age.@xcite ( laplace and others would later pursue the idea that newton s religiosity was a symptom of senility or derangement , perhaps subsequent to his nervous breakdown of 1693.@xcite )    members of other english families surnamed newton also bore crossbones on their coats of arms.@xcite that heraldic device appears to be medieval and might have been intended originally as a symbol of warlike prowess .",
