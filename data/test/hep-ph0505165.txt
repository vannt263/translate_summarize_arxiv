    "one of the most important current tasks in neutrino physics is to understand the full implications of the solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , and reactor @xcite neutrino data that became available in the last five years .",
    "while much of the recent effort has been focused on establishing the values of the neutrino masses and mixings , there has also been a growing realization that the same data may contain valuable information about other neutrino properties , such as its interactions with matter @xcite or with electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "any measured deviation of these properties from their standard model ( sm ) values would have profound theoretical implications . as part of this program , we wish to reexamine here the sensitivity of the recent solar neutrino measurements to the neutrino electromagnetic properties .",
    "the idea that the neutrino may possess a relatively large magnetic ( transition ) moment has been the subject of intense theoretical speculations for many years .",
    "it was originally put forth in the early 1970 s , as a possible explanation to the solar neutrino deficit @xcite : the solar neutrinos , it was argued , were `` disappearing '' as a result of the neutrino spin precession in the solar magnetic field . remarkably , this explanation  much improved with time @xcite  remained viable for the next three decades . only in 2002 did the kamland measurement of the reactor antineutrino disappearance @xcite conclusively rule it out as the _ dominant _ mechanism of the solar neutrino conversion .",
    "the possibility of the spin precession happening at a _ subdominant _ level , however , remains of great interest to this day , as a probe of the neutrino electromagnetic properties and , at the same time , of the magnetic fields in the solar interior .",
    "for definiteness , here we will focus on the case of majorana neutrinos .",
    "the experimental sensitivity to magnetic spin precession in this scenario is especially high , as has been long recognized @xcite : upon the spin flip , a majorana neutrino turns into an antineutrino and  thanks to flavor oscillations  can then be detected with some probability as an electron antineutrino , @xmath0 . the @xmath0 flux from the sun , in turn ,",
    "is strongly constrained by super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , and especially kamland @xcite which can detect @xmath1 conversion of the solar @xmath2b neutrinos at the level of a few hundredths of a percent .    to understand",
    "if the kamland bound places a nontrivial constraint on the neutrino magnetic moment , we need to compare it to the maximum possible @xmath0 flux from the sun .",
    "this must be done taking into account ( i ) the recently measured values of the oscillation parameters , ( ii ) the bounds on the solar magnetic field strength and ( iii ) the existing direct bounds on the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "we also need to consider that magnetic spin flip could occur either in the convective zone ( cz ) of the sun , which comprises the outer 30% by radius , or deeper in the radiative zone ( rz ) . in the first case ,",
    "the neutrino traverses a region of turbulent magnetic field ; in the second case , the field , if present , is smooth and frozen into stationary plasma .",
    "the physics of the neutrino evolution is quite different in the two cases and requires separate treatments .",
    "both the cz @xcite and the rz @xcite cases have been investigated in the literature and in both cases it has been concluded that it was _ a priori _ possible to have a signal greater than the current kamland sensitivity reach . in the case of the cz , even a bound on the neutrino magnetic moment was claimed .    in our analysis",
    ", we reach different conclusions . in the case of the rz",
    ", we find that the usual treatment , based on the @xmath3 resonance , works only for small flavor mixing . the large measured value of the solar neutrino mixing angle leads to a qualitatively new effect : the resonant level crossing disappears and no measurable magnetic spin flip can take place .",
    "a new analytical result , extending the classical `` magnetic resonance '' condition @xcite to large flavor mixing , is derived here for the first time .    in the case of the cz , we consider two qualitatively different models of the magnetic field .",
    "one of these models , that of the uniform kolmogorov turbulence , follows @xcite and our basic treatment of the neutrino evolution in this case agrees with that work .",
    "we , however , take what we regard as more physically justifiable magnetic field parameters .",
    "for the second model , we take a scenario of isolated flux ropes as suggested by the recent solar physics research .",
    "this scenario , to the best of our knowledge , is considered in the neutrino literature for the first time .",
    "the net result is that in both cases we estimate the maximum @xmath0 flux to be _ below _ the present kamland bound .",
    "we begin by giving the necessary background information , including the form of the interaction ( sect .",
    "[ sect : interaction ] ) , the known bounds on the neutrino magnetic moment ( sect .  [ sect : directbounds ] ) , the general properties of the solar magnetic fields ( sect .  [ sect : magnfields ] ) , and the form of the neutrino oscillation hamiltonian ( sect .  [ sect : oschamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the case of the rz magnetic field is treated in sect .",
    "[ sect : rz ] : after reviewing the conventional approach ( sect .  [",
    "sect : rz_conventional ] ) , we argue that resonant antineutrino production is suppressed for large flavor mixing ( sect .  [",
    "sect : rz_nores ] ) , derive a corresponding general analytical condition ( sect .",
    "[ sect : rz_analyt ] ) , and finally perform a direct numerical scan of the parameter space to confirm our analytical conclusions ( sect .",
    "[ sect : rz_scan ] ) .",

    "this can be easily seen , for example , using the definition of the @xmath21 matrix given above and the identity @xmath22 the _ transition _ ( @xmath23 ) moments , however  which lead to a simultaneous spin and flavor change , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath24  are perfectly allowed . * _ the interaction with the @xmath25 ( longitudinal ) component of the magnetic field vanishes identically , while the interaction with the transverse components @xmath26 is nonzero . _",

    ", we write eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagr ] ) in the three - dimensional notation as @xmath28 plugging in @xmath29  which neglects terms of order @xmath30  we find that the interaction picks the @xmath31 component of the matrix @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "+ the same conclusion can be reached by boosting the magnetic fields to the neutrino rest frame . *",
    "the real part of @xmath39 corresponds to the magnetic dipole moment and the imaginary part to the electric dipole moment .",
    "an ultrarelativistic neutrino precesses in an external magnetic field if _ either _ the magnetic or electric dipole moments are non - zero @xcite .",
    "following the convention , we will henceforth use the term  magnetic moment \" to refer to both possibilities .",
    "all these properties are well - known and are derived here for completeness .",
    "the laboratory bounds on the neutrino magnetic ( transition ) moment come from measuring the cross sections of @xmath40 or @xmath41 scattering in nearly forward direction .",
    "the recent bound for the interaction involving the electron antineutrino is @xmath42 at the 90% confidence level @xcite , where @xmath43 is the bohr magneton ( @xmath44 is the electron mass , @xmath45 is its charge ) .",
    "stronger bounds , @xmath46 , exist from astrophysical considerations , particularly from the study of red giant populations in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "larger values of the transition moment would provide an additional cooling mechanism and change the red giant core mass at helium flash beyond what is observationally allowed .    even allowing for new inputs ( such as updated distances to globular clusters ) or refinements in the stellar models , it appears extremely unlikely that the red giant bound could be weakened by more than a factor of a few .",
    "correspondingly , as a very conservative bound , we will take @xmath47 in the subsequent analysis .    from the theoretical point of view , the neutrino does possess a nonzero transition moment , already in the sm .",
    "it is induced by loop effects : as the neutrino briefly dissociates into virtual charged particles ( @xmath48 and a charged lepton @xmath49 ) , those constituent particles couple to the photon . because the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagr ] ) requires a helicity flip , and because in the sm the @xmath48 boson couples only to left - handed fields , the mass insertion has to be put on the neutrino line .",
    "the resulting moment is proportional to the neutrino mass and hence is highly suppressed , @xmath50 . in possible extensions of the sm , however , this need not be the case , and the effect can be proportional to the mass of the charged lepton running in the loop .",
    "for example , in the left - right symmetric model one obtains @xmath51 @xcite , where @xmath52 is the left - right mixing parameter in the model .",
    "the cz of the sun is known to host significant magnetic fields , which manifest themselves in a variety of effects on the solar surface ( sunspots , flares , prominences , etc ) .",
    "these fields are created and destroyed during each solar cycle by a combination of convective motions and differential rotation .",
    "detailed understanding of the solar cycle is still an active subject of research .",
    "nevertheless , the following general features of the cz fields are well established :    * the magnetic field observed in sunspots is several kg , exceeding the average surface field strength by three orders of magnitude .",
    "sunspots usually come in pairs of opposite polarity and are thought to be manifestations of large - scale magnetic structures residing inside the cz . * the total toroidal flux in the cz at sunspot maximum can be estimated from the total flux that emerges on the surface during the solar cycle , which is around @xmath53 mx @xcite . since the same flux tube may be emerging more than once ,",
    "@xmath54 mx has been argued to be the likely value @xcite . averaged over the cz , this gives a field of several kg .",
    "* the turbulent equipartition value for the magnetic field at the base of the cz can be expressed in terms of the density @xmath55 , the solar luminosity @xmath56 , and the distance to the center of the sun @xmath57 : @xmath58 kg ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "* modern models of the cz fields argue that fields on the order of 100 kg may exist in the cz . for the present discussion ,",
    "it is important to realize that such strong fields , if they exist , can occupy only a small fraction of the cz volume , such as the _ thin _ shear layer near the base of the cz ( ` tachocline ' ) , or be localized in isolated flux tubes @xcite .",
    "to have even half of the cz filled with such strong fields would be contrary to the flux arguments mentioned above , as well as basic energetics considerations .    for an in - depth review of the cz fields and further references ,",
    "the reader is urged to consult an excellent review @xcite . for the status of the present - day",
    "simulation efforts see , e.g. , @xcite .      unlike the cz",
    ", the rz has no internal motions to provide an active mechanism to generate magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the conductivity of the rz plasma is very high , which opens up the possibility that the rz could support large - scale magnetic fields left over from the early stages of the solar evolution .",
    "let us consider both of these points in turn .",
    "the evidence for the lack of any large - scale mixing motions in the rz comes from several sources .",
    "first , helioseismological studies show that , unlike the cz , the rz rotates as a solid body .",
    "( this fact by itself , incidentally , provides a hint that at least a weak poloidal field is present in the rz @xcite ) .",
    "second , solar model calculations show that the stratification ( entropy gradient ) in the rz interior is quite strong , precluding large radial motions .",
    "finally , a very impressive direct confirmation of the lack of radial mixing is provided by the observed beryllium abundance at the solar surface @xcite .",
    "be is destroyed at @xmath59 k , which is the temperature at @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the solar radius , @xmath62 km . since beryllium observed at the solar surface is not noticeably depleted relative to its primordial abundance ,",
    "the material at @xmath63 ( on the bottom of the cz ) and the material at @xmath64 have not been mixed during the lifetime of the sun ( except for a brief period during the pre - main sequence convection stage ) .    while a large - scale magnetic field in the rz is not being presently generated , it is also not destroyed by ohmic decay over the solar lifetime , 4.7 billion years .",
    "the ohmic decay time for large - scale field configurations is in the billions of years @xcite , in fact for the lowest toroidal mode it is about 24 billion years @xcite .",
    "over time , a primordial rz field has been invoked by many authors to explain a variety of effects : from the solar neutrino problem @xcite to the so - called princeton solar oblateness measurements @xcite .",
    "what is important for the present analysis is that the field in the rz , if it exists , must be ( i ) smooth and ( ii ) bounded in strength @xcite .",
    "smoothness follows from the fact that , because of ohmic decay , any small - scale magnetic field ( @xmath65 ) features would have decayed away over the lifetime of the sun .",
    "this ensures the adiabatic character of the neutrino evolution throughout the bulk of the cz .",
    "the bounds on the field strength come from several independent arguments , such as the measurements of the solar oblateness and the stability analysis of field configurations .",
    "it follows that the amplitude of the large scale toroidal field can not exceed @xmath66 mg @xcite .",
    "combined with the bounds on the size of the neutrino transition moment , this limits the value of the magnetic term ( see below ) in the neutrino oscillation hamiltonian .",
    "since flavor oscillations change the neutrino ( and antineutrino ) flavor and the magnetic interactions convert neutrinos into antineutrinos , the evolution of the neutrino state is , in general , governed by a @xmath67 hamiltonian matrix , with the neutrinos and antineutrinos of all three flavors . for the purpose of studying the spin flip in the rz",
    ", the problem can be reduced to a @xmath68 case .",
    "sector , solar neutrinos actually oscillate between @xmath69 and a certain superposition state of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . to stay with the tradition , we denote the latter state by @xmath70 ( and the corresponding superposition antineutrino state by @xmath72 ) . ] in the basis @xmath73 , the hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the transverse components of the magnetic field and the @xmath14 submatrices are given by @xmath76 here @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 is the neutrino mass - squared splitting , @xmath81 is its energy , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the electron and neutron number densities .",
    "the physical reason for the @xmath84 reduction is that the large atmospheric neutrino splitting effectively decouples two of the six states in the case of the smooth magnetic field .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the `` noisy '' field in the cz enables transitions between states separated by the large splitting .",
    "consequently , in the cz one may need to consider the full six - neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "historically , in discussions of spin - flavor precession ( sfp ) in the sun , special attention has been given to the  sfp resonance \" region @xcite , defined as the region where two of the _ diagonal _ terms in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h]-[eq : h3 ] ) , namely those corresponding to the @xmath85 and @xmath86 entries , become equal .",

    "when the resonant sfp mechanism was introduced back in the late 1980 s , the values of the oscillation parameters were essentially unknown .",
    "in contrast , nowadays the solar and kamland experiments have told us that @xmath90 ev@xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where it is noted that the evolution in the case of the rz does not decouple into two separate problems .",
    "the numerical conclusions presented in fig .  2 of that paper , however , are quite different from ours , as discussed later .",
    "the above treatment relies on the notion of resonance , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : res_diag ] ) .",
    "fundamentally , this notion comes from the analysis of a two - level system , and even there it applies only in the limit of small mixing @xcite .",
    "we wish to examine whether it can be applied to the four - level system at hand .",
    "let us first briefly review the physics behind the standard small - angle msw effect @xcite .",

    "the physical idea behind the resonance is that this suppression is lifted if the diagonal splitting becomes small in some region along the neutrino trajectory , as a result of the crossing of the levels .",
    "suppose @xmath100 over a distance @xmath101 .",
    "then , inside this interval , @xmath102 becomes _ the dominant part of the hamiltonian _ and hence drives oscillations .",
    "if @xmath103 is sufficiently large , it may be possible to obtain large flavor conversion .",
    "fits inside the interval @xmath103 .",
    "this condition gives nothing but the usual adiabaticity parameter of the resonance @xcite . ]    with this in mind , let us return to the hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h]-[eq : h3 ] ) .",
    "now , the electron neutrino state , in addition to being coupled to the @xmath72 state via the magnetic moment interaction , is also coupled to @xmath70 state via the flavor oscillation term .",
    "a simple , but crucial observation is the following : for large values of the mixing angle , even if the diagonal @xmath85 and @xmath86 terms are equal , the hamiltonian is _ still not dominated _ by the off - diagonal magnetic terms @xmath104 , but by the off - diagonal flavor oscillation terms @xmath105 .",

    "it can be said that there is a `` topological '' difference between the cases of small and large mixing and eq .",

    "the ratio @xmath154 varies with the distance to the center of the sun .",
    "correspondingly , the numerical value of @xmath155 for which the disappearance takes place varies with @xmath118 ( which controls the location in the sun where the level crossing could have happened ) . in the central region , @xmath156 , while for the outer regions @xmath157 .",
    "the corresponding variation in @xmath155 is @xmath158    let us finally discuss when each of the level - crossings , ( [ eq : cond ] ) and ( [ eq : condm1 ] ) , can affect the neutrino evolution .",
    "the answer depends on the probability of finding the initial electron neutrino in each of the two neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "this probability , in turn , depends on the flavor mixing angle at the production point .",

    "we have carried out a numerical scan of the oscillation parameter space , in the range @xmath169 ev@xmath91 .",
    "the calculation was carried out for the realistic numerical solar density and chemical composition profiles @xcite .",
    "for the magnetic field profile , we have taken the lowest toroidal ohmic eigenmode , as described in @xcite and in detail in @xcite .",
    "while higher eigenmodes could also be present , the choice of the lowest mode is expected to capture the essential physics : the field is axisymmetric , smooth , and vanishes at the rz / cz boundary .",
    "the only free parameter describing the field in this case is the overall mode normalization .",
    "we have performed scans for three different ( highly optimistic ) normalization values of the magnetic field , @xmath170 mg , also taking a highly optimistic value of the transition moment , @xmath171 .",
    "the results of the scan are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] .",
    "the three colored regions on the left side ( small mixing ) indicate the regions where the @xmath0 flux for the chosen normalization values of the magnetic field would exceed the kamland bound .",
    "the corresponding regions in the  dark \" side , @xmath147 , are also shown .",
    "all the regions agree well with the analytical analysis of the previous subsection .",
    "the figure also shows the allowed regions from the kamland analysis of their reactor antineutrino spectrum @xcite , as well as the region that gives a fit to the solar neutrino data ( unfilled contours ) .",
    "the best - fit ( `` lma - i '' ) region lies at the intersection of the solar and kamland regions and , as can be clearly seen , has no overlap with the regions where the @xmath0 flux would be measurable . we note that a similar conclusion was reached in @xcite , using , however , an analytical criterion that differs from eq .",
    "( [ eq : analyt_theta ] ) .",
    "the relatively large @xmath0 flux cited in that work was obtained by assuming the field strength of 50 mg at the neutrino production point , which was only later shown to be not allowed @xcite .",
    "compared to the case of the rz , the case of the cz requires a different treatment . the difference has to do with the turbulent nature of the cz magnetic fields .",
    "below , for completeness , we briefly review the relevant physics .",
    "the main idea is that random variations @xcite of the magnetic field on scales equal to , or smaller than , the neutrino oscillation length lessen the suppression of the oscillations by a large diagonal mass splitting . while the neutrino follows slow variations with scales longer than the oscillation length @xmath172 adiabatically , for shorter variations",
    "the adiabaticity condition is violated .",
    "the net result of the small - scale  noise \" is that the neutrino state vector performs a",
    " random walk \" in the oscillation space , gradually receding from its original position .    to be specific ,",
    "consider a simple model in which the magnetic field changes on scales of @xmath173 .",
    "the probability of spin flip upon traversing the first correlation cell , @xmath174 , is @xmath175 ( simple vacuum oscillation on scales smaller than the oscillation length ) .",
    "since the fields in different @xmath174 intervals are uncorrelated , as the neutrino traverses many domains the probabilities , not amplitudes , add up .",
    "for solar neutrinos , the experimental bound on @xmath0 flux implies @xmath176 .",
    "so long as this is satisfied , the probability of spin flip after traveling the distance @xmath177 can be written as @xmath178 .    for slow variations with @xmath179 , as already mentioned ,",
    "the evolution is adiabatic and the conversion probability is exponentially suppressed .",
    "one can also imagine a case when the field domains are longer than @xmath180 , but have sharp boundaries .",
    "in such a case , the conversion probability is @xmath181 we see that in any case the conversion is most efficient for @xmath182 , namely , @xmath183 .",
    "let us apply this to solar neutrinos .",
    "once again , we are interested in the high - energy @xmath2b neutrinos , as these are the neutrinos the kamland bound applies to .",
    "these neutrinos are produced almost exclusively in the heavy mass eigenstate @xmath184 and then propagate adiabatically through the rz . in the cz , these neutrinos encounter turbulent magnetic fields and ,",
    "if the transition moment is large , a small fraction of them gets converted into the light antineutrino mass eigenstate @xmath185 .",
    "the net result is the flux of neutrinos in the heavy eigenstate with possibly a small admixture of the antineutrinos in the light mass eigenstate .",
    "the light mass eigenstate , in turn , is detected as an electron antineutrino with probability @xmath186 .",
    "the relevant field fluctuations are those on scales of @xmath187 mev@xmath188 ev@xmath189 km .",
    "we will denote them by @xmath190 .",
    "overall , we get @xmath191    the oscillation parameters are known , @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "the extent of the region of the strong random field can be estimated to be some fraction of the cz , say @xmath194 . finally , the main issue is to estimate the size of the amplitude of the small - scale noise @xmath190 .",
    "unfortunately , the theory and simulation efforts are not yet at the level to give a robust prediction of @xmath190 ( see @xcite for the state of the art on the simulation front ) .",
    "we will next consider two models for the magnetic field .",
    "a physically sensible estimate can be obtained by assuming that ( i ) the field on the large scales is of the order of its turbulent equipartition value ; and ( ii ) that the small - scale noise follows some kind of a scaling law @xmath195 typical of turbulent systems .",
    "such approach was adopted in @xcite and , in our opinion , is a clear improvement over naive models of delta - correlated noise .",
    "the largest scale of the turbulence , at which energy pumping takes place , is estimated to be of order the typical pressure scale height in the cz . in the inner part of the cz , the pressure scale height is of order @xmath196 km @xcite .",
    "this number can be estimated directly from the solar model @xcite , and is also consistent with the value of the mixing length @xmath197 km at the base of the cz given in @xcite .",
    "although the corresponding large - scale eddies reside in the interior of the cz , they manifest themselves on the solar surface as _ supergranules _ ( @xmath198 km ) .",
    "these should not be confused with surface granules ( @xmath199 km ) whose size is dictated by the scale height near the surface .",
    "the turbulent equipartition value for the large scale turbulent fields near the bottom of the cz is estimated as @xmath200 kg @xcite .",
    "putting the numbers together , we find    @xmath201    this means that , for this field model , even with the most optimistic values of the neutrino magnetic moment kamland will not have a chance to see antineutrinos from the cz spin flip unless its sensitivity is improved by as least one order of magnitude .",
    "the estimate just given uses a simple model for the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "it is possible that the field in the cz instead has a `` fibril '' nature @xcite , i.e. , is expelled by the turbulence and combines in isolated flux tubes .",
    "it has been argued that the total energy of the cz ( thermal + gravitational + magnetic ) is reduced by the fibril state of the magnetic field by avoiding the magnetic inhibition of convection @xcite .",
    "let us then consider a model in which the neutrinos travel through spatially separated flux bundles . the conversion probability in this case depends on the transverse size of a bundle .",
    "given that a sunspot typically contains @xmath202 mx @xcite and assuming superequipartition field strength inside the bundle of @xmath203 kg , one finds the transverse size of the bundle that is actually close to optimal , @xmath204 km .",
    "the thickness of the flux rope comes out to be close to the oscillation length for the @xmath2b neutrinos , a remarkable coincidence indeed ! since the total toroidal flux in the cz is estimated to be of the order of @xmath54 mx @xcite , a given neutrino encounters only several of such flux bundles .",
    "the resulting conversion probability in the most optimistic case is then close to the kamland sensitivity bound , as can be easily checked .",
    "we have shown that the large measured value of the flavor mixing angle _ qualitatively _ changes the treatment of the neutrino interaction with the magnetic field in the radiative zone of the sun .",
    "the physics of the effect is most transparent in the basis of the mass eigenstates , rather than in the flavor basis .",
    "we have shown that in the mass basis , for the allowed values of the oscillation parameters , there is no neutrino - antineutrino level crossing and , as a result , no measurable antineutrino production in the rz .",
    "a correct level crossing condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond_solution ] ) , was derived , and a detailed numerical scan carried out to confirm this conclusion .",
    "we emphasize that the recent determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters is crucial for reaching this conclusion : for small flavor mixing angle , it was possible to have large @xmath3 conversion even with magnetic fields an order of magnitude below the bound , @xmath205 mg @xcite . moreover , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] , even a relatively minor shift of the best - fit point , from @xmath206 ev@xmath91 and @xmath207 to , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath208 ev@xmath91 and @xmath209 , would have made the resonant antineutrino production possible .",
    "the field of solar neutrinos has truly entered the precision measurement stage !",
    "one may wonder if our analysis is completely self - consistent .",
    "after all , the oscillation parameters we use are found assuming only the flavor oscillations and neglecting possible magnetic @xmath134 transitions .",
    "this , however , is entirely justified , because the kamland bound on the @xmath0 flux ensures that the magnetic transitions can be present only at very small levels and thus can not affect the fit to the oscillation parameters .    in the convective zone ,",
    "the solar neutrino propagate through turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "our estimate of the probability of the spin - flavor flip in this case gives a rate that , at present , is likewise not observable .",
    "this conclusion disagrees with earlier analyses .",
    "the source of the disagreement is not in the treatment of the neutrino evolution , but in the treatment of the solar magnetic fields , which we believe were significantly overestimated in the earlier studies .",
    "overall , our conclusion is that , despite achieving a clearly impressive level of sensitivity to @xmath0 from the sun , kamland has not yet reached the level where it would be placing a meaningful constraint on the neutrino transition moment and/or solar magnetic fields . on the other hand , kamland has reached the point where it may begin probing the `` optimistic '' scenario , @xmath210 .",
    "clearly , further sensitivity improvements through accumulation of additional statistics is very desirable .",
    "i owe special thanks to andrei gruzinov for countless  always very clear and helpful  discussions of the solar magnetic fields and plasma physics in general , to matthias rempel for a very helpful discussion and for pointing me to an excellent set of references , and to cecilia lunardini for many useful suggestions on the draft .",
    "i also acknowledge stirling colgate for a useful discussion of the physics of the convective zone fields .",
    "additionally , i benefited greatly from stimulating correspondence with evgeny akhmedov and timur rashba that followed the initial posting of the preprint of this paper .",
    "this work was supported by the department of energy , under contract w-7405-eng-36 .",
    "as described in sect .  [ sect : cz ] , simple physical arguments give the following estimates for the probability of spin - flavor flip in random magnetic fields : @xmath211 more generally , the probability of conversion is proportional to a fourier component of the field correlation function @xcite @xmath212 if @xmath213 is a slowly decaying function ( compared to @xmath214 ) with a vanishing slope for small @xmath215 , indicating no small - scale noise , for example @xmath216 $ ] , the resulting @xmath139 is exponentially small , as expected for adiabatic evolution .",
    "the quantity of interest in the isotropic turbulence model is @xmath217 .",
    "@xcite performed an estimate based on a simple kolmogorov turbulence . within this model ,",
    "the effects of the magnetic field on the character of the turbulence are neglected and the simple kolmogorov scaling law for velocities is applied , @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the energy dissipation rate per unit mass .",
    "the field was assumed to scale with @xmath220 the same way as velocities , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath221 .    more generally , if the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy of the fluid , the character of the turbulence changes ( see , e.g. , @xcite , pp .",
    "138 - 142 ) .",
    "the rate of energy transfer to small scales is decided by the interaction of alfvn waves in plasma .",
    "recent investigations @xcite argue that in the presence of magnetic fields the turbulence becomes anisotropic in @xmath222 space ( see @xcite , appendix a , for a clear summary ) . while a detailed discussion of the latest models of magnetohydrodynamics turbulence is clearly beyond the scope of this work , the preceding example show that the exponent in the scaling law ( [ eq : bscaling ] ) is not known precisely .",
    "the correlation function can then be parameterized as @xmath223 , yielding upon integration @xmath224 as expected on physical grounds .",

    "<S> we examine the efficiency of the electron antineutrino production in the solar magnetic fields , assuming the neutrinos are majorana particles with a relatively large transition moment . </S>",
    "<S> we consider fields both in the radiative and convective zones of the sun , with physically plausible strengths , and take into account the recently established values of the oscillation parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the production rate in question is presently unobservable . in the radiative zone , </S>",
    "<S> it is suppressed by the large measured value of the flavor mixing angle which eliminates the resonant level crossing . </S>",
    "<S> a corresponding general resonance condition , valid for large as well as small values of the mixing angle , is derived . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , in the convective zone , the strength of the small - scale magnetic field is likely to be insufficient . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no useful bound on the neutrino transition moment can be derived from the published kamland bound . </S>",
    "<S> kamland may be , however , on the edge of probing an `` optimistic '' scenario , making further improvements of its sensitivity desirable . </S>"
