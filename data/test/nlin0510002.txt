    "increasingly the collective behavior displayed by groups of interacting dynamical components , each of which may be capable of a full range of complex dynamics , is essential to understanding and ultimately designing systems .",
    "examples in biology , physics , and engineering are diverse , ranging from understanding sensory perception to the design of antennas capable of simultaneously sending and receiving signals at the same frequency . while in general the dynamical components may be functionally distinct and heterogeneous , in many examples one is interested in the collective behavior displayed by a group of similar coupled elements .",
    "one commonly studied example is the synchronization of oscillating subsystems that interact .",
    "the ability of a group of coupled oscillators to synchronize despite a distribution in individual frequencies is a broadly applicable phenomenon . in physical systems",
    "coherent oscillations can be used to enhance detector sensitivity or increase the intensity of a power source .",
    "synchronization is also important in biological systems where the collective behaviors in populations of animals , such as the synchronized flashing of fireflies or the coherent oscillations observed in the brain , serve as examples . including a distribution in individual frequencies in an otherwise homogeneous ensemble captures some of the inevitable differences that group members will possess .",
    "although synchronization is often put forward as an example of the importance of understanding nonlinear phenomena , the intuition for it , and indeed the subsequent mathematical discussion , often reduces to simple linear ideas .",
    "for example , the famous example of huygens clocks @xcite can be understood in terms of a linear coupling of the two pendulums through the common mounting support .",
    "then the larger damping of the symmetric mode ( coming from the larger , dissipative motion of the common support ) compared with the antisymmetric mode leads at long times to a synchronized state of the two pendulums oscillating in antiphase .",
    "the nonlinearity in the system is simply present in the individual motion of each pendulum ; specifically in the mechanism to sustain the oscillations . without the drive , the oscillators would still become synchronized through the faster decay of the even mode , albeit in a slowly decaying state . rather than this mode - dependent dissipation mechanism , one might expect synchronization to arise from the intrinsically nonlinear effect of the frequency pulling of one oscillator by another .",
    "furthermore , the model describing the two pendulums , as well as most other models used to show synchronization , has dissipative coupling between the oscillators .",
    "in contrast , many physical situations have mainly reactive coupling .",
    "nanoscale mechanical oscillator arrays are one example that offer significant potential in a range of technologies @xcite,@xcite . due to the scales and numbers in these arrays ,",
    "active control of individual oscillators poses a number of challenging problems .",
    "synchronization offers a potentially appealing alternative in some applications .",

    "the intersections of the various synchronized states lead to rich phase diagrams .",
    "there are a number of interesting features of these phase diagrams .",
    "the instability of the unsynchronized state occurs over a limited range of @xmath10 at fixed @xmath8 , so that the unsynchronized state regains stability at very large values of the coupling strength , although a large amplitude synchronized state also occurs here , often terminated by a saddle - node bifurcation as @xmath10 is decreased .",
    "this large amplitude synchronized state may also survive down to @xmath447 , i.e.  even in the absence of the nonlinear frequency pulling .",
    "for bounded distributions the state that develops from the linear instability of the unsynchronized state as @xmath10 is decreased is synchronized ( the order parameter is nonzero ) but there is no frequency locking",
    ". the phase diagrams also show a wide variety of multistability , with one or more synchronized states and the unsynchronized state coexisting over various parameter ranges , leading to hysteresis as the parameters are varied",
    ". the multistability may be particularly dramatic for the large amplitude synchronized states such as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_zig_zag ] where many synchronized states coexist , leading to a band of solutions in the large @xmath25 limit .",
