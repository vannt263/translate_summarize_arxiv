    "a lunar - based radio wavelength observatory would have two key advantages over ground - based observatories .",
    "first , if located on the far side of the moon , the observatory would be shielded from terrestrial transmissions , both natural and human - generated .",
    "only a small fraction of the radio spectrum is allocated for use by astronomy .",
    "ground - based observatories are often located in remote areas , in an effort to allow them access as much of the spectrum as possible .",
    "nonetheless , many observatories are contending with an increasing fraction of the spectrum being inaccessible .",
    "second , the earth s ionosphere is opaque at wavelengths longer than about  30  m ( frequencies below about  10  mhz ) .",
    "in contrast , without a permanent ionosphere , the surface of the moon opens a spectral window that is entirely inaccessible from the ground , potentially to wavelengths as much as two orders of magnitude longer than those accessible from the ground .",
    "we summarize here key science that would be enabled by a lunar - based radio observatory .      in the standard hot big bang cosmology ,",
    "the universe started in an initially hot , dense ionized state . as it expanded and cooled",
    ", it underwent a phase transition to a largely neutral state at the time of recombination .",
    "after recombination , baryons began to collapse into overdense regions , eventually leading to the formation of stars and galaxies .",
    "today , the collective action of stars and galaxies maintain the universe in a largely ionized state .",
    "the _ epoch of reionization _ ( eor ) marks this transition from neutral to ionized and is associated with the development of structures in the universe . as structures began to form and heat their surroundings ,",
    "it is expected that the excitation state of hydrogen would become decoupled from the temperature of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "thus , the formation of the first structures may be traced by the 21-cm line emission generated as they heat their surroundings .",
    "observations of high - redshift quasars and the cosmic microwave background indicate that the eor was well underway by a redshift @xmath0 and concluded by @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the growth of structures , particularly during the linear phase preceding the collapse into stars and galaxies , also suggests redshifted hydrogen signals may be produced from structures with redshifts as large as @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the expected wavelength range ( @xmath3 for @xmath4 , or @xmath5 ) is a heavily used region of the spectrum ( e.g. , containing the fm radio band ) , with little regulatory protection for radio astronomy .",
    "ground - based arrays designed to detect the redshifted h@xmath6i signal are being deployed , often in the most radio - quiet regions of this planet .",
    "however , the absence of local transmitters may not be sufficient as ionized meteor trails and ionospheric layers can reflect power from distant transmitters .",
    "in contrast , the far side of the moon is an internationally recognized `` shielded zone '' ( @xcite ) , with emphasis given to protecting it for observations that are `` difficult or impossible from the surface of the earth , '' particularly at wavelengths longer than 1  meter ( @xmath7  mhz ) . the far side is also protected , during a portion of the lunar orbit , from solar radio emissions .",
    "terrestrial and solar interference may ultimately be a limiting factor for ground - based telescopes and a lunar - based telescope will be necessary to exploit fully the hydrogen signal from the .",
    "the magnetic polar regions of the earth and the solar system giant planets host intense electron cyclotron masers generated by solar - wind powered electron currents .",
    "magnetospheric emission can aid the understanding of extrasolar planets by providing information that will be difficult to obtain otherwise : the existence of a magnetic field constrains the interior of a planet while modulation of the emission can yield its rotation rate . for a terrestrial planet , a magnetic field may be important for habitability , shielding the planet from the harmful effects of energetic charged particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "empirical relations for solar system planets suggest that radio emission from extrasolar planets may be detectable over interstellar distances ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "magnetospheric emissions from the solar system planets show a rough correspondence between planetary mass and emission wavelength , and _ only jovian radio emissions are at a short enough wavelength that they can be detected from the ground_. observations above the earth s ionosphere will be needed to detect and study sub - jovian mass extrasolar planets .",
    "acceleration of particles to super - thermal and relativistic velocities occurs in a variety of astrophysical environments , from the sun and other dwarf stars to neutron stars and black holes to quasars .",
    "a fundamental astrophysical problem is understanding the mechanisms and sites of particle acceleration .",
    "a key aspect of particle acceleration mechanisms is the low energy population which provides the `` seeds '' from which the highest energy particles result .",
    "these low energy particles emit , and are best studied at , the longest wavelengths .    within the inner heliosphere ( 210  solar radii , @xmath8 measured from the sun s center )",
    "intense electron beams are produced , at times with particles having energies rivaling `` the energies of some accelerated particles in the distant [ quasars ] '' ( @xcite ) , and a significant fraction of solar wind heating occurs .",
    "radio wave observations and spacecraft coronagraphs , notably those on the solar heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , have provided dramatic indications of the violent , magnetically - driven activity of the sun and its connection to particle acceleration .",
    "because of its proximity and brightness , the inner heliosphere is one of the best places to study the fundamental physics of particle acceleration .    solar radio bursts are one of the primary manifestations of particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere .",
    "previous space - based radio observations have been from single dipole instruments with _ no imaging capabilities_. thus , fundamental questions remain about particle acceleration sites .",
    "for example , at  1  , electron acceleration generally occurs where the shock normal is perpendicular to the magnetic field ( quasi - perpendicular , @xcite ) , similar to acceleration at planetary bow shocks and other astrophysical sites . in the corona ,",
    "the magnetic field is largely radial , yet the existing radio observations suggest that the acceleration site is in front of a , a _ quasi - parallel _ geometry .",
    "an imaging instrument , one with even modest angular resolution , is required to locate the sites of radio emission , and therefore the electron acceleration .",
    "interest in placing a radio telescope on or around the moon pre - dates the apollo missions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a series of workshops and conferences describe scientific goals and preliminary concepts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by discussing technical aspects of the surface of the moon as an observatory site ; the scientific aspects are discussed above .",
    "we then turn to how radio observatories might be deployed , with the capability of lunar radio observatories growing with the human presence .",
    "some of the value of the moon as an astronomical site ( at long wavelengths ) is also true for a space - based array , and there have been proposals for such arrays ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to free - flying telescopes at shorter wavelengths ( @xcite ) , the lunar surface offers two significant benefits to a radio array .",
    "( 1 )  a dipole in space responds to the full @xmath9  sr , so a free - flying array must image the full sky all of the time , with all of the sources present ( sun , jupiter ,  ) .",
    "limited mass budgets have restricted proposed arrays to a small number of elements .",
    "the resultant challenge is to image the entire sky with an extremely sparse aperture .",
    "in contrast , on the moon , the lunar surface shields @xmath10  sr , making the imaging problem less challenging , and imaging algorithms developed for terrestrial interferometers can be utilized , whereas a space array requires the development of new algorithms . also , it is practical to deploy a much larger number of dipoles .",
    "( 2 )  in order to form an interferometer , antenna separations must be known and maintained to a fraction of a wavelength during the observations . while the relevant wavelengths are large ( @xmath11  m ) , station keeping does necessitate use of on - board resources .",
    "in contrast , the lunar surface is stable with an extremely low level of seismic activity , so antenna positions can be determined once and then assumed constant .      the rolss array is a concept designed for deployment during the first lunar sorties ( figure  [ fig : lazio.rolss ] ) .",
    "it is intended to conduct astronomical observations of the sun , primarily for the purpose of probing particle acceleration mechanisms , as well as to serve as a pathfinder for future , larger arrays .",
    "the baseline rolss array consists of  3 arms arranged in a ` y ` configuration with an operational wavelength range of  30300  m ( 110  mhz ) , i.e. , at wavelengths longer than can be accessed from the ground .",
    "each arm hosts 16 antennas and is 500  m long , providing approximately @xmath12 angular resolution at  30-m wavelength ( 10  mhz ) .",
    "the arms themselves consist of a polyimide film ( pf ) on which electrically - short dipole antennas are deposited , and they hold the transmission system for sending the electrical signals back to the central processing facility , located at the intersection of the arms . the central processing facility would select a 100  khz sub - band within the operational wavelength range , filter and digitize the signals , then downlink them to the ground for final imaging and scientific analysis .",
    "observations at long wavelengths can address a number of important science priorities , as discussed above , however , the arrays required to conduct the requisite observations are much larger than the rolss array .",
    "a value of interferometers is that they can `` grow , '' with scientific capability increasing as the number of antennas is increased . indeed , many of the ground - based radio interferometers have been preceded by prototypes having a much smaller number of antennas , but which were scientifically productive themselves , and scientific observations began with many of the ground - based radio interferometers well before they reached their final complement of antennas .",
    "stage  i ( rolss ) : :    a small interferometer located on the near side . stage  ii : :    a modest - sized interferometer ( e.g. , 256 dipoles spread over a few to    several kilometers ) , possibly though not necessarily located on the    far side of the moon .",
    "such an interferometer might be capable of    detecting the brightest extrasolar planets , and verifying ground - based    observations of the . stage  iii : :    a fully capable interferometer located on the far side .",
    "part of this work was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
