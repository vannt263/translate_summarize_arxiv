    "the spectra of quasars and seyfert galaxies show strong emission lines superimposed onto a bright continuum .",
    "the continuum contains a significant feature in the optical - ultraviolet region , known as `` the big blue bump '' . due to the huge photoelectric opacity of the galaxy , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ionizing continuum , between the lyman limit and the soft x - rays ( euv  x ) ,",
    "is hardly known .",
    "fortunately , owing to the redshift effect and the transparency of the quasar environment , it has been possible to infer the sed of quasars down to @xmath1350 .",
    "composite energy distributions were derived by zheng etal .",
    "( 1997 ) and later by telfer etal .",
    "( 2002 ) using archived hst - fos spectra . before averaging ,",
    "each spectrum was dereddened for galactic absorption as well as statistically corrected for the absorption due to intergalactic ly@xmath2 absorbers and lyman limit systems .",
    "a striking feature of the composite quasar sed is that a significant steepening occurs around 1100 , leading to a far - uv powerlaw of index @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "korista , ferland & baldwin ( 1997 ) pointed out the difficulties of reproducing the equivalent widths of the high ionization lines of heii ( 1640 ) , civ ( 1549 ) and ovi ( 1035 ) , assuming a powerlaw as soft as @xmath5 .",
    "state of the art photoionization models favor a much harder sed , one that peaks in the extreme - uv beyond 22ev ( e.g. casebeer , leighly & baron 2006 ; korista etal .",
    "1997 ; baldwin etal .",
    "the far - uv break is clearly seen in individual spectra ( see binette etal . 2005 : hereafter b05 ) .",
    "the amount of steepening varies considerably from object to object .",
    "binette & krongold ( 2006 ) recently analyzed the spectrum of ton34 ( @xmath6 ) , which is the object with the steepest break known , with a far - uv behavior given by @xmath7 .",
    "however , strong emission lines of ovi and civ are present .",
    "there is no generally accepted interpretation of the nature of the far - uv break .",
    "we review below possible absorption mechanisms that would give rise to the break and at the same time allow the emergence of an upturn in the extreme - uv , in order that the ionizing sed be as hard as needed in photoionization calculations of the emission lines .",
    "we hereafter assume that the far - uv break results from absorption and will consider two possibilities : ( i) hi [ ly@xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ... and bound - free ] and ( ii) interstellar dust . we will consider four locations for the absorbing medium : ( @xmath10 ) intergalactic , ( @xmath11 ) local to the quasar ism , ( @xmath12 ) accretion disk photosphere and ( @xmath13 ) accelerated outflow from quasars .",
    "the resulting eight cases are illustrated in fig.1 with labels 14 for hi and a  d for the dust .",
    "the aim is to resolve the problem of the ionizing sed , which appears to be too soft . among the eight cases reviewed , some have the potential to resolve the softness problem , either because the local belr sees a different sed ( intergalactic absorption ) , or because the absorption in the uv is followed by a flux upturn at higher energies .",
    "case       binette etal .",
    "( 2003 ) studied this possibility .",
    "they assumed an hi behavior ( as a function of @xmath14 ) proportional to the gas density expected from the warm - hot intergalactic medium .",
    "although they could reproduce the tz02 composite , they rejected this possibility , since their model predicted a jump in flux blueward of 1216  ( observer - frame ) that is not observed .",
    "an absorber at the quasar redshift results in a sharp absorption edge at 912  as well as in an ly@xmath2 absorption line .",
    "such pronounced and sharp features do not match the far - uv steepening discussed above .",
    "state of the art ` naked ' accretion disk ( nad ) models predict a steepening ( i.e. lyman edge ) near ly@xmath2 . however , the far - uv break is not reproduced well by nad models ( c.f .",
    "fig.22 in hubeny etal .",
    "the lyman edge from a nad model is not followed by a flux upturn at higher energies , hence the softness problem remains unresolved .",
    "the same may be said of the comptonized accretion disk model although in that case the uv break is well reproduced ( zheng etal .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "eastman , macalpine & richstone ( 1983 ) could generate a steepening of the continuum by having absorptions clouds progressively accelerated up to 0.8@xmath15 .",
    "exploration of a different behavior of the hi opacity with velocity would be welcomed , as these calculations might shift the break position to the observed value near 1100(instead of 1216 ) , and possibly produce a flux upturn beyond 20ev .",
    "furthermore , by including hei opacity , such models might explain the curious dip observed at 500  in one of the most studied quasar , he2347@xmath164342 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "interestingly , both the 1100  and 500  breaks are blueshifted by comparable amounts with respect to rest - frame hei and hi ly@xmath2 ( at 584  and 1216 , respectively ) .",
    "case   ",
    "b05 studied the possibility of intergalactic dust consisting of nanodiamond grains ( other dust compositions were unsuccessful ) .",
    "they could reproduce the dip displayed by the far - uv indices when plotted as a function of redshift .",
    "this possibility was rejected , since it required too much intergalactic dust ( @xmath117% of the cosmic carbon ) .",
    "it also required that only nanodiamond dust is formed .    assuming a nanodiamond dust component intrinsic to each quasar",
    ", b05 successfully reproduced the far - uv break observed in individual quasars of the tz02 sample .",
    "the flux upturn taking place below 650  in these models near allow the intrinsic sed to be much harder than indicated by extrapolating of the flux near the uv break .",
    "such an upturn was identified in 4 quasar spectra .",
    "an example , pg1008 + 1319 , is shown in the left panel of in fig.1 . from a spectrum that combines various archives ,",
    "binette & krongold ( 2006 ) reported a far - uv rise in ton34 .",
    "a 6th example is provided by he2347@xmath164342 ( see upturn shortward of 700  in fig.2 ) .",
    "shang etal .",
    "( 2005 ) explored the possibility of ism and smc - like extinction .",
    "it would be interesting to compute the sed emerging from a nad photosphere that contains small amounts of nanodiamond dust . if the break is accounted for by dust , much harder ( hotter ) disk seds could be envisaged .",
    "nanodiamonds have so far been identified in emission around 3 stellar disks .",
    "a large uv fluence may facilitate dust formation .",
    "we consider the hypothesis of an accelerating dust outflow not to be needed nor useful for the purpose of explaining the far - uv break .",
    "we find that the three cases 4 , b , and c are worth exploring further , as they may reconcile the observed downturn in the far - uv with the need of a harder sed to account for the high ionization emission lines .",
    "the exploration of absorption by an intrinsic crystalline carbon dust screen ( case c ) is at this stage the most developed hypothesis .",
    "we are currently exploring its consequences in the infrared and uv in order to provide ways to falsify such models ."
