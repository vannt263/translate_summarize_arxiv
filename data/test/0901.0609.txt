    "warped extra dimensions present an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem , where all fundamental parameters are of the order of the planck scale . the weak scale ",
    "planck scale hierarchy is obtained by an exponential warp factor , which is naturally small provided the higgs field is localized towards the so - called infrared brane  @xcite .",
    "if all standard model ( sm ) fields propagate in the bulk , the theory leads to the presence of kaluza klein ( kk ) modes which tend to be localized towards the ir brane and therefore couple sizably to the higgs .",
    "this in turn leads to large mixing between the heavy sm particles and their kk modes , leading to modifications of the electroweak parameters and therefore to strong constraints from electroweak precision measurements  @xcite@xcite .",
    "these constraints may be weakened by the introduction of brane kinetic terms  @xcite@xcite or custodial symmetries  @xcite ,  @xcite , which allow the presence of kk modes with masses of the order of a few tev .",
    "one of the attractive features of these models is the natural explanation of the hierarchy of fermion masses by the localization of the fermion fields in the bulk  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the chiral properties of the fermions are obtained by imposing an orbifold symmetry and demanding that the fields are odd or even under such a symmetry .",
    "fermion fields that are even under the orbifold symmetry at the infrared and ultraviolet branes present zero modes , which are chiral and therefore may be identified with the sm fermion fields . the localization of the zero modes is governed by the bulk mass parameter @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the curvature of the extra dimension and @xmath4 , a number of order one . while the zero modes of chiral fields with @xmath5 couple weakly to the higgs and are therefore light , the heavy sm fields are associated with bulk mass parameters @xmath6 . due to the exponential behavior of the zero mode wave functions ,",
    "large hierarchies between the fermion masses are generated by small variations of the corresponding @xmath4-parameters .",
    "gauge higgs unification models identify the higgs field with the five dimensional component of the gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "an extended gauge symmetry is necessary for the successful implementation of this mechanism . in particular",
    ", models based on the gauge group @xmath0 include the custodial and weak gauge symmetry via @xmath7  @xcite,@xcite @xcite . moreover , provided the @xmath8 symmetry is broken to a subgroup of @xmath9 by boundary conditions at both branes , the fifth dimensional components of @xmath10 have the proper quantum numbers to be identified with the higgs field , which is exponentially localized towards the ir brane .",
    "since the higgs originates from gauge fields , its tree level potential vanishes . in a previous work  @xcite , we computed the one - loop effective potential and demonstrated that electroweak symmetry breaking , with the proper generation of third generation quark and gauge boson masses may be obtained for the same values of the bulk mass parameters that lead to agreement with precision electroweak data at the one - loop level .",
    "moreover , we showed that the higgs mass is in the range 110150  gev and that a light kk mode of the top quark , @xmath11 , appears in the spectrum , with a mass small enough so that the kk gluon may decay into it .",
    "the presence of this light kk mode has a strong impact on the phenomenology of the model  @xcite .",
    "for instance , searches for the kk gluon by its decay into top - quarks  @xcite,@xcite , @xcite is rendered difficult due to the presence of the additional dominant decay mode into kk top - quarks and the broadness of the kk gluon .",
    "on the contrary , the constructive interference between the qcd and kk gluon induced pair production of the top - quark kk mode allows to search for a @xmath11 for values of the masses much larger than those at reach in the case of just the qcd production cross section .    in this article",
    ", we will analyze the addition of the lepton sector in the gauge higgs unification scenario . to add leptons",
    ", we will proceed in a similar way as for the quark sector .",
    "the left - handed leptons will be added in a fundamental representation of @xmath8 , with @xmath12 , while the right - handed neutrino and charged lepton fields will be added in a fundamental representation and a @xmath13 of @xmath8 also with charge @xmath14 , respectively .    due to the gauge origin of the higgs field ,",
    "a possible local infrared brane operator @xmath15 , which could lead to large values of the neutrino majorana masses , should come from the fifth dimensional component of the covariant derivative of the lepton fields and therefore can only naturally arise from the integration of the right - handed neutrinos , with a local ir majorana mass .",
    "indeed , since the fields associated with the right - handed neutrino zero modes are singlets under the conserved gauge groups on both the infrared and ultraviolet branes , one can always add majorana masses for these fields on the infrared and ultraviolet branes .",
    "we will therefore consider these masses and implement a see - saw mechanism for the generation of the light neutrino masses  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we will show how to incorporate these masses within the context of these models , obtain the modified profile functions and define the conditions to derive a realistic spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of an exchange symmetry  @xcite , which is preserved in the bulk , yields a natural dark matter candidate in the spectrum , that may be identified with the odd kk modes of the right - handed neutrino .",
    "this exchange symmetry requires the identification of the bulk mass parameter of the dark matter candidate with the one of the right - handed neutrinos , establishing a connection between neutrino masses and the relic dark matter density .",
    "we will show that , if the odd fermions are assumed to be dirac particles , the predicted relic density is the correct one for dirac fermion masses of the order of 1 tev . in the majorana case , somewhat smaller masses are allowed , and the results depend on the relative values of the ultraviolet and infrared majorana masses .",
    "we will show that in both the dirac and majorana cases , direct detection experiments will efficiently probe the existence of the proposed dark matter candidates .",
    "the article is organized as follow : in section 2 we discuss the properties of leptons in scenarios of gauge higgs unification . in section 3",
    "we discuss the generation of charged lepton and neutrino masses . in section 4",
    "we analyze the possibility of incorporating dark matter via an exchange bulk symmetry , analyzing the couplings and the annihilation diagrams , as well as the direct detection of these dark matter candidates .",
    "we reserve section 5 for our conclusions .",
    "some technical details are given in the appendix .",
    "the goal of the current work is to add the lepton sector into the minimal gauge higgs unification model described above , including right handed neutrinos , with brane majorana masses .",
    "we will proceed in a similar way as in the quark case  @xcite , and discuss the general question of charged lepton and neutrino mass generation .",
    "similar to the quark sector , we let the sm @xmath16 lepton doublet containing the left - handed charged leptons and neutrinos , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , arise from a @xmath19 of @xmath20 , where the subscript refers to the @xmath21 charge .",
    "the right handed neutrino , @xmath22 will be included as the singlet component in a fundamental representation of @xmath8 , while the right - handed charged lepton , @xmath23 , is placed in a @xmath24 of @xmath8 analogously to the @xmath25 .",
    "one may also include brane mass terms connecting different multiplet components , as well as new brane majorana masses for the right handed neutrino @xmath22 : @xmath26    the right handed neutrino , @xmath22 , in principle could be identified with the singlet right - handed component in the same multiplet as the left - handed leptons .",
    "however , in order to naturally suppress lepton flavor violation effects and maintain agreement with precision electroweak measurements , the left - handed leptons should be localized towards the uv brane  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the zero modes of the corresponding right - handed multiplet will therefore be localized towards the ir brane .",
    "this implies that even with a natural scale for the brane masses @xmath27 , the exponential suppression of the wave function at the uv brane would lead to a effective majorana mass for @xmath22 which is much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "this , in turn , after the implementation of the see - saw mechanism , leads to too large values for the observed neutrino masses .",
    "therefore , as we will discuss below , it will prove to be necessary to have the left - handed leptons in a different multiplet as the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if @xmath22 belongs to the same multiplet as the left - handed leptons : @xmath28 @xmath29 alternatively , the right - handed neutrino can be incorporated in a different multiplet from the left - handed lepton one .",
    "the two multiplet assignments are as follows :    @xmath30    @xmath31    where we show the decomposition under @xmath32 , and explicitly write the @xmath33 charges .",
    "the @xmath34s are bidoublets of @xmath32 , with @xmath35 acting vertically and @xmath1 acting horizontally .",
    "the @xmath36 s and @xmath37 s transform as @xmath38 and @xmath39 under @xmath32 , respectively , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath32 singlets .",
    "the superscripts , @xmath42 , label the three generations .",
    "we also show the parities on the indicated 4d chirality , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 stands for odd and even parity conditions and the first and second entries in the bracket correspond to the parities in the uv and ir branes respectively .",
    "let us stress that while odd parity is equivalent to a dirichlet boundary condition , the even parity is a linear combination of neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , that is determined via the fermion bulk equations of motion as discussed below .",
    "the boundary conditions for the opposite chirality fermion multiplet can be read off the ones above by a flip in both chirality and boundary condition , for example @xmath45 . in the absence of mixing among multiplets satisfying different boundary conditions ,",
    "the sm fermions arise as the zero - modes of the fields obeying @xmath46 boundary conditions .",
    "the remaining boundary conditions are chosen so that @xmath47 is preserved on the ir brane and so that mass mixing terms , necessary to obtain the sm fermion masses after ew symmetry breaking , can be written on the ir brane .",
    "consistency of the above parity assignments with the original orbifold @xmath48 symmetry at the ir brane was discussed in appendix b of ref .",
    "the three families will behave similarly , and therefore , we will drop the family indices and concentrate only on one lepton family .",
    "large mixing angles in the lepton sector can be naturally obtained while suppressing lepton flavor changing neutral currents if the left - handed leptons have similar bulk mass parameters , @xmath49  @xcite,@xcite , and in the following we will assume them to be equal .",
    "we will return to this issue in section  [ sec : flavor ] .",
    "the zero modes of the leptons are too light and too weakly coupled to the higgs boson to affect the higgs potential in any significant way .",
    "the lepton kk modes may be coupled more strongly to the higgs , but their gauge invariant mass is much larger than the higgs induced one and therefore they tend to contribute only weakly to both the higgs potential and to precision electroweak observables .",
    "one can add localized brane mass terms to the lagrangian in both the one and the two multiplet cases : @xmath50 - \\big[m_{ir}\\delta(x_5-l)-m_{uv}\\delta(x_5)\\big]n_r n_r~;\\label{localizedmasses_1}\\\\ \\mathcal{l}_{2 } & = & -2\\delta(x_{5}-l ) \\big [ \\bar{n}^\\prime_l m_{l_1 } n_r + \\bar{l}_{1l } m_{l_2 } l_{3r } +   \\mathrm{h.c . }",

    "the fermions , like the gauge bosons , can be expanded in their kk basis : @xmath51 solving the equations of motion in the presence of @xmath52 becomes complicated , as the different modes are mixed .",

    "let s first analyze the case of a dirac boundary mass term on the infrared brane , @xmath57 , involving fields from different multiplets @xmath58 , @xmath59 for the different multiplets .",
    "quite generally , we shall call the profile of the left - handed field and the right - handed field participating in the mass term @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the right handed component , @xmath62 with profile function @xmath63 and the left - handed component @xmath64 with profile function @xmath65 have dirichlet boundary conditions on the brane , and therefore @xmath66 .",
    "the equations of motion of the fields are affected by the localized masses , which induce a discontinuity on the odd - parity profile functions at the infrared brane .",
    "indeed , keeping only the relevant terms , the integration of the equation of motion leads to @xmath67 therefore , we obtain : @xmath68 and , similarly for the @xmath65    @xmath69    eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) and  ( [ limit2 ] ) can now be reinterpreted as the new boundary conditions for the profiles at the ir brane .",

    "( [ limit2_ir]-[limit2_uv ] ) can now be reinterpreted as the new boundary condition for the profiles at the branes .",
    "the generalization of these expressions to the general case is straightforward .",
