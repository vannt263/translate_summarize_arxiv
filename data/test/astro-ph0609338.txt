    "over the last decade a concordance model has emerged in cosmology in which about two - thirds of the energy density of the universe today may be in the form of `` dark energy '' .",
    "this explains the observation that we reside in an accelerating universe @xcite . despite its importance to the formation and evolution of the universe",
    "there are no compelling theories that explain the energy density nor the properties of the dark energy .    to address questions about the nature of dark energy a number of ambitious wide - field optical and infrared imaging surveys have been proposed .",
    "these range from space - based missions in the optical and infrared , such as the supernova acceleration probe ( snap , proposed as the space - based joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) ) , to ground - based surveys such as the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , the dark energy survey ( des ) , the large synoptic sky survey ( lsst ) and others .",
    "each of these missions approaches the study of dark energy using multiple , complementary observational probes : gravitational weak lensing ( wl ) to study the growth of structure and geometry , baryon oscillations to measure the angular diameter distance vs. redshift relation and type ia supernovae to measure the luminosity distance vs. redshift relation .    in this paper",
    "we focus on one of these probes , weak lensing , and how the design of a survey might impact its scientific value for constraining dark energy",
    ". observations to date have succeeded in measuring the amplitude @xmath3 of the @xmath4 dark matter power spectrum to @xmath5 accuracy ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite and references therein ) by surveying @xmath6  deg@xmath7 of sky . to constrain the equation of state of dark energy",
    "requires that we improve the accuracy of these measures by close to an order of magnitude . to achieve this deep imaging surveys",
    "have been proposed that cover surveys of 1,000 - 20,000 square degrees in 5 - 6 filters .",
    "there is , however , a natural trade off in the design of these surveys ; depth vs number of filters vs area surveyed .",
    "to date the appropriate weighting of these components is not fully understood .",
    "for example , given the time and cost of a survey , does a large area , shallow survey in a small number of filters provide more scientific return than a deep survey in a large number of filters but sampling only a few hundred square degrees ?",
    "one of the primary requirements for any lensing application is the need for redshift information on the source galaxies . in the first studies of lensing only the statistical redshift distribution was available , but now surveys aim to get photometric redshifts ( connolly _ et al . _  1995",
    "; hereafter photo - z s ) for individual galaxies .",
    "accurate photo - z information enables new qualitative and quantitative advances in lensing .",
    "conversely photo - z errors can be a limiting systematic in the use of lensing for precision cosmology .",
    "lensing tomography refers to the use of depth information in the source galaxies to get three - dimensional information on the lensing mass @xcite . by binning source galaxies in photo - z bins",
    ", the evolution of the lensing power spectrum can be measured .",
    "this greatly improves the sensitivity of lensing to dark energy in cosmological applications .",
    "the lensing power spectra measured from two redshift bins is shown in figure [ fig : cl ] .",
    "the two auto - spectra and the cross - spectrum , along with expected statistical errors , are shown .",
    "the relative shift in the amplitudes of the lensing spectra is sensitive to the properties of dark energy .",
    "it depends on both distances and the growth of structure , thus enabling tests of dark energy or modified gravity explanations for the cosmic acceleration . in figure",
    "[ fig : cl ] , the amplitude shifts of the three spectra ( for a given cosmological model ) depend on the mean redshifts and widths of the two photo - z bins ; clearly any errors in the bin redshifts will degrade the ability to discriminate cosmological models .",
    "thus the use of broadband multicolor photometry to estimate the distances of galaxies ( i.e.photometric redshifts ; henceforth abbreviated as photo - z s ) is critical to the use of lensing for dark energy studies .",
    "the capability of these surveys to meet their scientific goals will depend on our ability to characterize the uncertainties present within photometric redshift estimates , i.e. the scatter , bias and fraction of outliers .",
    "photometric redshifts must be calibrated with an appropriate sample of spectroscopic redshifts ( huterer _ et al . _  2005",
    "; ma _ et al . _",
    "this may be done more cheaply by using auto- and cross - correlations of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts samples @xcite , which can also be used to estimate the redshift distribution for a galaxy sample where the calibration data is incomplete ( see also zhan & knox 2006 ) .    in this paper we study the possibility of doing lensing tomography from limited color information . imaging in five or more bands",
    "is needed for well - characterized photo - z s of galaxies extending beyond @xmath8 .",
    "we consider here whether lensing tomography can be carried out from a wide - area imaging survey in just two or three filters , along with a relatively small calibration sample that provides the statistical redshift distributions in all parts of the color space .",
    "these can be used to create a few sub - samples of the full galaxy sample that occupy distinct redshift bins , while discarding galaxies with colors that lead to badly defined redshift distributions . since lensing does not require redshift bins much narrower than @xmath9-@xmath10 in redshift , and does not need a full or fair sample of the galaxy population , there is reason to expect that limited color information may be sufficient for tomography .",
    "we use a mock catalog of galaxies with known redshifts to see how well one can make cosmological measurements with this approach , taking into account statistical errors in lensing measurements . in a future paper",
    "we will expand upon this analysis to include various sources of systematic errors in colors / photo - z s and in the lensing measurements .    in section 2",
    "we describe the formalism for computing lensing power spectra given the redshift distribution of a galaxy sample . in section 3",
    "the mock catalog used for our study is described .",
    "section 4 contains the results on how well one can do with color cuts in making well separated redshift distributions for galaxy sub - samples .",
    "the errors on the power spectra and dark energy parameters are compared with the forecasts for idealized photo - z s . in section 5",
    "we discuss the prospects for tomography with color cuts from imaging in a limited number of filters  which we call color tomography .",
    "we will use the shear power spectrum as the lensing statistic for dark energy constraints .",
    "similar results can be obtained using two - point correlations and the mass aperture statistic .",
    "the key element in constraining dark energy is to use source galaxies in different redshift bins to probe the evolution of mass fluctuations and the geometric factors involved in lensing .",
    "we work in the context of spatially flat cold dark matter models for structure formation .",
    "the expansion history of the universe is given by the scale factor @xmath11 in a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "the expansion rate , the hubble parameter , is given in terms of the matter density @xmath12 ( the cold dark matter plus the baryons ) and dark energy density @xmath13 at present ( in units of the critical density @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter at present ) by @xmath16\\ ] ] where we have employed the normalization @xmath17 today and @xmath18 specifies the equation of state for dark energy as @xmath19 note that @xmath20 corresponds to a cosmological constant .",

    "next we need the growth of density perturbations . in linear theory ,",
    "all fourier modes of the mass density perturbation , @xmath27 , grow at the same rate , the growth rate @xmath28 : @xmath29 .",
    "note that we use the primordial curvature power spectrum amplitude to normalize the linear 3d mass power spectrum , and therefore @xmath28 is normalized as @xmath30 in the deeply matter dominated regime ( e.g. , @xmath31 ; see equation  ( 10 ) in takada 2006 for details ) . in the following",

    "the lensing weight function @xmath36 is defined in equation [ eqn : weight ] below .",
    "photometric redshift information on source galaxies allows us to subdivide the galaxies into redshift bins .",
    "the average number density of galaxies in a redshift bin @xmath2 , defined to lie between the comoving distances @xmath37 and @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the redshift selection function of source galaxies .",
    "it is normalized as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the average number density per unit steradian .",
    "note that @xmath43 determines the shot noise contamination due to the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies for the power spectrum measurement in the @xmath2 bin ( see equation ( [ eqn : covps ] ) and discussion below ) .",

    "for example , increasing @xmath47 lowers @xmath44  similar to the dependence of the growth rate of mass clustering for cmb normalization .",
    "thus the dependence of lensing observables on the equation of state arises roughly equally from the two effects .      to compute the convergence power spectrum",
    ", we employ the flat - sky , limber equation which is a good approximation over angular scales of interest ( kaiser 1992 ; hu 2000 ) . within this framework the lensing convergence field is decomposed into angular modes based on the two - dimensional fourier transform : @xmath48 .",
    "the angular power spectrum , @xmath49 , is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dirac delta function , @xmath52 denotes ensemble averaging , and @xmath53 .    for lensing tomography",

    "therefore , we need an accurate model of @xmath57 , for which we employ the fitting formula proposed by smith et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter smith03 ) .",
    "we assume that the smith03 formula can be applied to dark energy cosmologies , if we replace the growth factor in the formula with that for a given dark energy cosmology ( white & vale 2004 ; linder & white 2005 ) .",
    "the issue of how accurately the non - linear power spectrum needs to be calibrated to attain the full potential of lensing surveys is addressed in huterer & takada ( 2005 ) .",
    "measured shear correlations contain a shot - noise contribution from the intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies . assuming that the ellipticity distribution is uncorrelated between different galaxies , the observed power spectrum between redshift bins @xmath2 and @xmath54",
    "can be expressed as ( kaiser 1992 , 1998 ; hu 1999 ) @xmath61 where @xmath43 is the average number density of galaxies in redshift bin @xmath2 , as given by equation ( [ eqn : ni ] ) , and @xmath62 is the intrinsic shape noise of each galaxy .",
    "the kronecker delta function enforces the fact that the cross power spectrum with @xmath63 is not affected by shot noise ( hu 1999 ) . in this sense",

    "the solid curves are the results from the smith03 fitting formula .",

    "even with only two redshift bins , the power spectra are highly correlated ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "one thus gains little information from fine subdivisions of the redshift bins ( hu 1999 , 2002a , b ) .",
    "the box around each curve shows the expected measurement error at a given bin of @xmath69 , which includes sample variance and the error due to intrinsic ellipticities .",
    "the sample variance dominates the error over much of the angular scales that provide cosmological information .",
    "finally , to clarify the effect of non - linear gravitational clustering , the thin solid curve shows the prediction of @xmath77 from the linear mass power spectrum : non - linear evolution significantly enhances the amplitude for @xmath60 ( jain & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "a monte - carlo realization of @xmath78 galaxies was generated to approximate the redshift and colors distributions of galaxy samples obtained by the next generation of photometric surveys ( e.g. the lsst ) .",

    "( 2001 ) to a depth of @xmath2=27 . for each galaxy",
    "a redshift and spectral type was assigned .",
    "the redshifts were drawn from the magnitude - redshift distributions observed by the deep2 spectroscopic survey ( willmer _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) and the evolution of the distribution of spectral types of galaxies was based on the observations and models of franceschini _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 .",
    "colors were estimated , as a function of redshift and spectral type , using the @xmath79 filter response functions of the lsst ( see figure [ fig : filters ] ) . in total 10 spectral templates",
    "were used in this sample which were derived from the observed spectral properties of galaxies in the sdss ( including emission lines ) and supplemented with a young ( 50 myr ) star forming galaxy template drawn from the models of bruzual and charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "photometric uncertainties are estimated based on the lsst exposure calculator assuming that each source has been observed approximately 400 times in each filter .",
    "the final catalog was limited to @xmath80 at which depth the galaxies have a signal - to - noise of approximately 15 for lsst s exposure times .",
    "thus the photometric errors in our catalog are smaller than would be expected in shallower surveys ; we leave a detailed modeling of this and other errors for future work .",
    "figure [ fig : colors ] shows the distribution of galaxies in color space .",
    "galaxies in three redshift intervals are shown to illustrate that , while they generally occupy different regions in color space , there is significant overlap , and moreover they can not be isolated by making simple color cuts .",
    "we use these properties to guide our algorithm for selecting regions in color space for tomography in the next section .",
    "having constructed our mock galaxy catalog , we used a set of heuristic criteria to cluster galaxies in color space .",
    "the goal is to construct 2 - 4 sub - samples with the `` cleanest '' possible redshift distributions . to achieve this we identify the redshift distribution of each region of color space , discard the regions with poorly behaved distributions , and group the rest into a set of sub - samples that would be useful for lensing tomography , i.e.",
    "have well separated and compact redshift distributions .",
    "we pixelized @xmath81 vs. @xmath82 space into 400 pixels , and used the redshift distribution of each pixel to rank pixels in order of increasing mean redshift .",
    "we also characterized the compactness of the distribution associated with each pixel by computing its low order moments .",
    "we then grouped pixels into sub - samples following a set of heuristic criteria :    * the mean redshift associated with each pixel in a sub - sample fell within a well - defined redshift range . * the redshift distribution of each pixel retained was sufficiently compact ( had a small variance ) . * the joint distribution of pixels included a desired fraction of the total number of galaxies ( typically more than a quarter of the total ) . * the mean redshifts of the 3 or 4 sub - samples were useful for lensing tomography , i.e. were sufficiently well spread out over the range @xmath83 .",
    "this was iterated to arrive at the final selection and grouping of color pixels and thus the boundaries of the final redshift sub - samples .",
    "figure [ fig : dndz ] shows the results of making color cuts to isolate four redshift intervals with boundaries at @xmath84",
    ". we can trade - off number of galaxies within a sample versus how `` clean '' the redshift intervals are : the left and right panels of the figure show the results of different trade - offs . in the right panel ,",
    "about half of the galaxies are discarded so that the resulting redshift samples have almost no overlap . in the left panel ,",
    "the overlap is at the @xmath85 level or smaller .",
    "this level of overlap provides a clean enough separation for wl tomography , but risks contamination of the lensing signal by intrinsic alignments .",
    "hence we use the more conservative choice in the right panel for dark energy forecasts below .",
    "we also note that for baryon oscillation measurements the widths in redshift of these sub - samples are too large ; one would need to focus on finding particular galaxy types that yield tighter redshift distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : dndz2 ] shows the results for a shallower sample with limiting magnitude @xmath86 .",
    "the basic result is similar , though with fewer galaxies at @xmath87 , it is more difficult to make four well separated sub - samples .",
    "we also explored the possibility of lensing tomography with just two - band imaging .",
    "we used cuts in @xmath82 color and @xmath2 band magnitude to create two or three different redshift distributions ( note that for the three - band case , we did not use the magnitudes to improve our redshift selection ) .",
    "while this is clearly an idealized exercise , in that it assumes a large calibration sample and does not include systematic errors or allow for variation in the spectral templates , the results in figure [ fig : dndz3 ] show that it is not a hopeless goal .",
    "tomography is possible in up to three bins if @xmath88 of the galaxies can be discarded ( left panel ) , though with significant overlap between the first two redshift samples .",
    "an alternative is to make just two samples ( right panel ) while losing fewer galaxies and having minimal overlap between the samples .",
    "we will quantify the consequences for cosmological parameter estimation below .",
    "figure [ fig : power ] shows the lensing power spectra with errors for a 2,000 square degree survey with three - band imaging , using the four redshift distributions of figure [ fig : dndz ] . next we compare the errors on the power spectra for two cases : ( a ) all galaxies within a redshift range were used to compute the power spectrum ( this represents the case of idealized photo - z s ) , and , ( b ) only galaxies selected using color cuts were used to compute the power spectrum ( with distributions shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : dndz ] ) . while the sample variance contribution is nearly the same as it depends on the amplitude of the power spectrum itself , the shot noise contribution is higher with the color cuts due to the loss in number density of galaxies .    since the change in errors is undetectable on the power spectrum plot",

    "the errors increase by a few percent to over 50% depending on the sample and the range of @xmath69 . at low wavenumber , @xmath89 , for all cases",
    "the increase in error is at the 10% level .",
    "thus color tomography does not degrade the errors at low wavenumber , since the errors are dominated by sample variance . at high wavenumber",
    "@xmath90 the degradation depends on the fraction of galaxies discarded in making the redshift sample ; for the right panel it is as high as 50% .",

    "these parameters are @xmath117 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath118 .",
    "adding redshift slices for tomography improves the errors on these parameters significantly up to 4 - 6 slices as it provides information on the redshift evolution of the amplitude of the lensing power spectrum .",
    "errors on the shape parameters , such as the logarithmic slope of the power spectrum @xmath58 , do not change appreciably .",
    "we have studied the prospects for lensing tomography with a wide area imaging survey that has limited color information .",
    "while it is never desirable to limit color information , it may be that a full complement of filters is not available at a survey telescope , that it is un - realistic to image the full survey area in all filters , or that additional science requirements for a survey dictate an observing strategy that is not optimal for lensing tomography .",
    "the questions we address in this study are whether lensing tomography is at all feasible with two or three band imaging data , and if so , what is the trade - off between filter choice and sky coverage .",
    "we use the fact that lensing tomography makes only statistical use of estimated redshifts and , given the width of the lensing kernel , the redshift bins can be quite broad ( though they must be known accurately ) . further , for planned wide - area surveys lensing measurements are not shot noise limited  hence a significant fraction of galaxies can be discarded if their redshifts are ill - defined without severely degrading parameter accuracy . with these considerations in mind ,",
    "we generate a mock catalog of galaxies extending to high redshift with known types , redshifts and colors .",
    "this provides an estimate of the redshift distributions for each part of @xmath81 and @xmath82 color space . from this",
    "we select regions in color space that produce sub - samples with redshift distributions well suited for tomography .",
    "errors on the power spectra in different redshift bins from this color tomography are then compared with what would be expected with idealized photo - z s .    the resulting degradation in the accuracy of cosmological parameters is shown in tables [ tab : lens ] and [ tab : lens+cmb ] , and figures [ fig : fisher1 ] and [ fig : fisher2 ] for dark energy parameters from color tomography . with three - band imaging ,",
    "the errors on dark energy parameters are only modestly degraded compared to idealized six - band photo - z s .",
    "even with two - band imaging , lensing tomography may be feasible for the case of high signal - to - noise data and an adequate calibration sample .",
    "this result may have implications for how to trade - off filter choice and sky coverage for large area surveys and how to optimize survey strategy to maximize the scientific returns in its initial stages .",
    "for example , imaging in three filters instead of six is more than twice as efficient in terms of survey time since the @xmath119 and @xmath120 filters ( on the blue and red end ) are substantially less efficient .",
    "thus , for a fixed survey duration , the survey area for a six band program would be less than half that of the three band survey , with all parameter errors scaling as @xmath121 .",
    "such trade - off studies must be carried out for the specific parameters and available choices in observing strategy for a given survey ; the fiducial parameters we have considered do not correspond to any real or planned survey known to us .    for color tomography",
    "an adequate calibration sample is essential .",
    "the calibration will likely require a two - step approach : a sample of spectroscopic redshifts of over @xmath122 galaxies ( for a @xmath123 square degree survey ) , and a larger sample of multi - band imaging with a full set of optical and possibly infra - red filters .",
    "imaging to a depth equivalent to @xmath124 in say six bands over @xmath125-@xmath126 square degrees would provide a sample of well measured photo - z s for over @xmath127 million galaxies .",
    "this would enable us to map the redshift distributions over the desired color space : e.g. , it could provide photo - z s of over @xmath128 galaxies in each bin of @xmath129 magnitude in two - colors ( assumed to be available for the full survey area ) .",
    "it has been recognized that even with five or six band imaging data , photo - z s would need to be carefully calibrated with spectroscopic redshifts so that the means and widths of redshift bins are known to high accuracy ( bernstein & jain 2004 ; huterer _ et al . _  2006",
    "; ma , hu and huterer 2006 ) , and proposals for calibration are being developed ( newman 2006 ) .",
    "for color tomography the calibration sample is even more important , as it forms the basis for grouping and discarding regions in color space .",
    "we leave for future work the detailed requirements and strategy for obtaining the calibration sample .",
    "our current study is based on estimates of statistical errors in the lensing power spectra  in future work we will include systematic photometric uncertainties and other systematic errors that affect lensing .",
    "these will include a realistic modeling of photometric errors , filter design , and will address whether the spectral templates are adequate for describing high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the inclusion of these realistic errors is essential before one can make detailed trade - off studies of survey duration and filter choice .",
    "several caveats are in order until such a study is done : systematic errors may lower the signal - to - noise and this may depend on scale , testing for systematics is more difficult with coarser redshift bins , and marginalizing over intrinsic ellipticity contributions may be harder ( see below ) .",
    "finally , the inclusion of other statistics such as higher order correlations and cross - correlations with the galaxy distribution can alter the results on parameter accuracies .",
    "some of these issues can be tested on ongoing multicolor surveys , such as the cfht legacy survey .",
    "our results on the power spectrum errors in figure [ fig : power_ratio ] show that the degradation in errors is worse at high @xmath69 , because the shot noise term dominates on small scales .",
    "this raises the question : should one choose different galaxy samples at different @xmath69 : be more conservative at low @xmath69 , since number density matters less , to minimize redshift overlap and bias ?",
    "this merits a detailed study as it has the potential to impact different survey strategies .",
    "such a study must include non - gaussian contributions that increase the sample variance at high @xmath69 ; this in fact lowers the degradation for color tomography as the shot noise regime shifts to higher @xmath69 ( e.g. kilbinger & schneider 2005 ) .    finally , intrinsic ellipticity alignments ( e.g. heymans _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) and ellipticity - shear alignments ( hirata & seljak 2004 ) must be considered .",
    "while we did choose as our fiducial sub - samples ones with well separated redshift distributions , it may be necessary to only use cross - spectra to eliminate intrinsic ellipticity contributions ( e.g. takada & white 2004 ) .",
    "this would increase the parameter errors from having a smaller number of redshift bins .",
    "similarly ellipticity - shear correlations may need to be measured from the data and marginalized over , which is easier to do with finer redshift binning .",
    "four redshift bins are the minimum needed to separately fit for both kinds of intrinsic ellipticity correlations , this may impose a minimal requirement on the needed color information .",
    "the impact of intrinsic alignments is likely to be the most important issue for future studies related to color tomography .",
