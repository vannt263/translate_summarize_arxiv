    "peptide nucleic acid ( pna ) are synthetic oligonucleotides first reported by nielsen@xcite with a backbone that recapitulate dna s inter - nucleobase distances .",
    "pnas were developed as dna mimics in order to recognize dna double helix@xcite and to form hybrid duplexes with dna@xcite or homoduplexes@xcite .",
    "pnas duplexes have high thermal stability , are not sensitive to nucleases or protases , and are metabolically stable . however , as polyamide backbone has no charge , no coulomb repulsion is reported and pna aggregates may exists in solution , and their solubility in water is limited@xcite .",
    "pnas have attracted interest in molecular biology and numerous applications have been reported , we can cite beacons for duplex dna@xcite , and pna as a diagnostic tool@xcite , a genomic tool@xcite , or a supramolecular barcodes@xcite .",
    "these applications were leveraged on the unique properties of pna hybridizing to dna or rna .",
    "the enhanced hybridization properties of @xmath0-modified pna have been recently harnessed for gene editing applications@xcite .",
    "pna have also been used to tag small or macromolecules and program their assemblies based on hybridization@xcite @xcite .",
    "pna homoduplexes have also been used in programmed assemblies as recently illustrated for the programmed pairing of pna - tagged protein fragments@xcite . while interactions of pna with dna or rna have been extensively studied , homoduplex formation of pna are not well characterized , particularly for modified pnas .    pna - dna hybridization by watson - crick base pairing are well studied@xcite .",
    "they reveal a helix formed by the @xmath0-carbon and the nitrogen of the tertiary amide of the pna backbone@xcite , stabilized by the sequential base stacking@xcite .",
    "pna neutral backbone bring thermal stability in pna / dna duplex compared to dna / dna duplexes , and present a better specificity@xcite . because of the absence of charge on the pna backbone , the pna / dna hybrids are not dependent on the ionic strength of the solvent in contrast to dna homoduplexes .",
    "because of a flexible backbone , watson - crick , hoogsteen , reverse hoogsteen , or wobble interactions can be formed by pna / dna duplexes@xcite .    unlike dna which has a helical conformation due to its chiral centers , standard pnas , with no chiral carbon ,",
    "have no defined structural conformation in solution . adding a chiral center on the pna backbone forces left or right helix@xcite , and increases pna / dna hybridization . adding a lysine improves water solubility@xcite",
    ", however the serine is less disruptive to hybridization and oh groups can form hydrogen bonds with water in order to increase solubility . with the help of chiral centers , pna homoduplexes should also be observed , and eventually present secondary helical structures . in this study , we explore the biophysical properties of pnas built with a chiral center .",
    "the chiral center chosen here , consists in a l - serine substitution of the @xmath0-position on the pna backbone@xcite , see insert in figure [ pna_molec ] .    in order to determine homo - hybridization of pnas through a structural pre - organization ,",
    "a series of @xmath0-pnas were analyzed by circular dichroism ( cd ) and liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "nmr allows to spotlight hydrogen bounds formed by nucleic acid base - pairing . working in neutral conditions ,",
    "specific nmr experiments bring information about the imino hydrogens engaged in the watson - crick , hoogsteen , or wobble bounds . melting transitions ( @xmath1 ) of the highlighted pna homoduplexes were determined by cd and absorbance experiments .",
    "circular dichroism is finally used to assess the secondary structure displayed by the homoduplexes .",
    "all the experimental results show unambiguously that pnas duplexes are formed , and that the chiral centers improve their stability , and drive the duplexes into a chiral secondary structure , probably organized as a left - handed helix .",
    "pnas were synthesized as previously reported and purified by hplc@xcite .",
    "six pnas ( see figure [ pna_molec ] with a schematic view ) were chosen according to their nucleobases and the presence or absence of @xmath0 modification on the backbone .",

    "this indicates a stronger binding for the g - c base pair compared to the t - g base pair .",

    "the same temperature variation experiment has been made for pna and , ( see figures s12 and s13 supplementary material ) and lead to the same conclusion .",

    "the duplex , with 10 potential base - pairs and a chiral backbone for both strands , presents an high stability , with a transition temperature well above 100@xmath2c .",
    "such an extreme stability implies that we can not be sure of the complete pairing of the strands in this sample , as the annealing cycles , performed in water , can not completely disrupt the duplex in order to allow a complete sampling of all the possible conformations .",
    "for all the pnas tested here , the experimental melting temperatures are quite higher than the computed values of their rna counterpart .",
    "this is probably due to the absence of the strong coulombic repulsion observed in rna because of the charged backbone .",
    "it should be noted that the differences between the experimental and computed values present important differences for the considered pnas . in the case of pnas and , with four watson - crick g - c and 2 wooble t - g base pairs , this difference is 30 to 35@xmath2c .",

    "they present differences on the same order of magnitude , except may be for pna which lacks chiral centers , and for which the entropic effect of the long non paired strand may have some destabilization effect .",
    "pna on the other hand is puzzling .",
    "while it is expected to form only 4 watson - crick g - c base pairs , it presents a melting transition equivalent to pna , 58@xmath2c above its theoretical rna counterpart .",
    "this can not be explained without the formation of additional non - standard base pair , such as the c@xmath6a or a@xmath6a base pairs , as observed in some rna secondary structures@xcite .",

    "this shows a pronounced cotton effects , characteristic of a helix as show by dragulescu - andrasi et al@xcite .",
    "this secondary structure is disrupted at high temperature ( green curve ) , as at 368k the ellipticity signal presents much less structure and remains mostly flat , probably dominated only by the chirality of the backbone c@xmath7 carbons .",
    "this absence of secondary structure at high temperature is characteristic of the melting of the duplex , as was already indicated by the hyperchromicity observed at high temperatures ( see supplementary material figure s17 ) .",
    "the curves recorded at 308k before and after ( blue curve ) the high temperature denaturation are fully superimposed , indicating that the secondary structure of pna in solution is fully reversible .",
    "all these results are indicative of the formation of a chiral supramolecular organization , probably in the form of a helical secondary structure of the double strand .",
    "comparison of the overall shape of the cd spectra with the literature@xcite , and considering an antiparallel duplex , the maxima around 262 and 217 nm , and the minima around 277 , 238 , and 200 nm indicate that the formed duplex is probably a left handed helix .    in the same manner , ellipticity curves for pna , and",

    ", we can observe that the maxima of the cd spectra occur at slightly different wavelengths , characteristic of slightly different structural organizations .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that pna can adopt homo- and hetero - duplex conformations in solution through the formation of standard watson - crick as well as non - standard base pairing .",
    "these duplexes are extremely stable and present melting transitions at temperatures higher than their nucleic acid homologues .",
