    "spontaneous symmetry breaking has been fundamental to characterize phases of matter .",

    "are fundamental . generically speaking ,",

    "in contrast , as for the quantum liquids and the spin liquids , it is natural to have a finite excitation gap unless one assumes exotic spinon fermi surfaces .    to characterize such quantum liquids and the spin liquids , topological quantities such as the berry phases and the chern numbers are quite useful@xcite .",
