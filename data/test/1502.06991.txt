    "ground - based doppler radial velocity surveys and space - based photometric surveys have established that planets are very common , and perhaps ubiquitous , around sun - like stars . in particular , analysis of detections by the nasa _ kepler _",
    "mission show that planets with radii of 1 - 2 earth radii ( r@xmath2 ) are far more common than larger planets @xcite .",
    "comparisons between estimates or upper limits on mass from doppler radial velocity measurements and radii from _ kepler _ also suggest that the densities of planets ( at least planets on short - period orbts ) smaller than 1.5m@xmath2 are consistent with a `` rocky '' ( silicates + metals ) composition , while larger planets have an additional low - molecular weight ( e.g. hydrogen ) envelope @xcite . however , the data are insufficiently precise to inform as to the exact composition of these planets and regardless there are degeneracies in mass and radius with different bulk compositions .    the photospheres of dwarf stars on the main sequence are broadly representative of the material from which the star and any circumstellar disk formed .",
    "additional information about planet composition might therefore be inferred by determining elemental abundances in the host - star photosphere .",
    "this connection is supported by the observation that the abundances of refractory elements in the solar photosphere are , to a large extent , mirrored by that in primitive chondritic meteorites , the latter widely used as an analog of the primordial building blocks of planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to a lesser extent , these abundances are reflected in the bulk composition of the planets such as earth , but with some important exceptions .",
    "the two most abundant heavy elements in the galaxy and sun ( and presumably planet - forming disks ) are carbon ( c ) and oxygen ( o ) . in the cool interstellar medium ( ism ) , star - forming regions , and molecular cloud cores , c and o",
    "are present primarily as the co molecule ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of the unit stochiometry of the co molecule , whether c or o is in excess controls which element is available to form other compounds and thus the chemistry of the gas and solids that condense or equilibrate with the gas",
    ". the solar ratio of these two elements is presently estimated at @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also asplund et al .",
    "2009 ) , however this value is not necessarily universal .",
    "the two elements differ in their predicted pathways of stellar nucleosynthesis and c / o has a strong positive correlation with metallicity @xcite .    motivated by condensation scenarios for the solar nebula @xcite and observations of widely varying c / o among solar - type stars @xcite , @xcite proposed that c / o controls the abundance of water in planetary systems . during condensation from a hot gas with c / o @xmath4 , excess oxygen forms refractory silicate minerals and eventually h@xmath5o .",
    "however , in systems with c / o near a critical value ( about 0.88 ) , no o for water is available after silicate condensation and planets accrete from `` dry '' material . at still higher",
    "c / o , the deficiency in o causes carbides and graphite to become more stable and replace silicates in the condensation sequence ; thus `` carbide planets '' with very un - earth - like mineralogies , interior structures , and atmospheres might form around stars with c / o @xmath0 .",
    "many analyses of the spectra of solar - type stars obtained for galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) studies @xcite and doppler radial velocity surveys found that a significant fraction have c / o @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a series of subsequent works have predicted the final bulk composition of planets by modeling ( i ) the sequential condensation of elements and formation of planetesimals from a cooling gas disk with an initial composition set by host star abundances ; and ( ii ) the accretion of those planetesimals into planets via integration of the dynamical equations of motion .",
    "these scenarios have been applied to specific systems where the photospheric abundances of elements have been estimated , variously predicting water - rich `` ocean planets '' and `` carbon planets '' lacking any water @xcite .",
    "one question at the foundation of these works is whether c / o really varies widely among galactic disk stars in the solar neighborhood and ever approaches unity .",
    "abundances of c and o are more uncertain than for many other elements because of the limited number of usable absorption lines , confusion with lines of other elements , and non - lte corrections .",
    "recent studies have revised the c / o of nearby solar - type stars , including those that host known planets , downwards @xcite .",
    "these newer studies find no cases where c / o @xmath6 , the threshold where carbide minerals are expected to first form .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that the occurrence of c - rich systems in surveys of solar - type stars conflicts with the lack of known c - rich ultracool t dwarfs , as the latter are easily distinguished by their spectra @xcite .",
    "a second issue is the assumption that the solids in planetary systems condense from a cooling gas of stellar composition in a circumstellar disk .",
    "equilibrium condensation can explain some solids in primitive chondrites , widely considered analogs to the building blocks of planets , but these solids constitute only a small fraction of those meteorites .",
    "calcium aluminum inclusions ( cais ) and amoeboid olivene agregates , the most abundant refractory condensates in chondritic meteorites , have volume abundances @xmath7% and typically @xmath8% @xcite .",
    "the dominant constituents of chondritic meteorites are chondrules and fine - grained matrix , and there is compelling evidence that these are the product of incomplete sublimation and chemical alteration of pre - existing solids , e.g. older generations of solids and even pre - solar dust from the parent molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "this processing occurred under conditions that were very different from a gas of solar composition , i.e. an oxygen - rich environment and dust - to - gas ratios @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this environment could have been created by gravitational settling to the mid - plane of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "because of this , the composition of planeteismals reflects the composition of dust grains in the molecular clouds cores that collapse to form stars and planets , plus subsequent thermal processing at mid - plane conditions .",
    "ism dust was , in turn , the product of processing in the interstellar medium involving cycling of order @xmath10 times between denser , cooler clouds , where it accreted mantles of atoms , and the hotter intercloud phase , where shock - heated ions and high - energy radiation ( uv , x - rays , cosmic rays ) sputtered atoms from the grains @xcite .",
    "an equally intriguing possibility is that the compositions of planetesimals and/or planets can be _ inferred _ from differential measurements of abundances in the photospheres of stars .",
    "this approach is motivated by the detection of small differences in stellar abundances of elements that are more refractory ( higher condensation temperature @xmath11 ) and thus more likely to be incorporated into planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these differences could arise either from the accretion of planetesimals or planets onto the star , after the dissipation of disk gas , or the sequestration of solids into planets , and accretion of the dust - poor gas onto the star .",
    "this leads to a prediction that these differences correlate with the presence or properties of planetary systems , and provides a potential `` short - cut '' to discovering planets as well as estimating their chemical composition .",
    "however , subsequent analyses of larger samples of stars does not support such a correlation @xcite , and alternative explanations for these differences should be considered .    in this work",

    "galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models predict changes in the abundances of elements and isotopes with time in both stars and the ism @xcite .",
    "they combine yields of nucleosynthetic products in stellar winds and ejecta with the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and a prescription for star formation rate to estimate the production of elements and isotopes .",
    "these are integrated with descriptions of the flow of heavy elements back into the ism and subsequent incorporation in long - lived low - mass stars and remnants from high - mass stars .",
    "production varies with both stellar progenitor mass and metallicity , thus the changing metallicity of new generations of stars must be tracked in a gce .",
    "carbon and oxygen are synthesized in stars more massive than 1.5m@xmath12 and injected into the interstellar medium through winds and type ii supernovae ( sn ) : type i sn are predicted to contribute @xmath13% @xcite .",
    "gce models generally predict a positive trend of c / o with metallicity ( and hence time ) as well as variation between stellar populations with different chemical histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these trends are broadly observed within disk stars and between the thin , thick - disk and bulge populations , and even between massive and metal - poor irregular dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "at least two effects are thought to contribute to this correlation : ( i ) the short main - sequence lifetime of massive stars , which are major contributors to @xmath14-elements including c and o , compared to intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) progenitors , which contribute comparatively more to the c budget ; ( ii ) increased mass loss and c yield from younger , more metal - rich agb stars at the expense of o. mass - loss rates depends on metallicity through its effect on the opacity of outer stellar atmospheres and the impact on their structure .",
    "the implications of the abundance dependence of c / o yields for the chemical evolution of galaxies has been previously pointed out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the c / o of bulge and disk populations diverge due to a combination of differences in the stellar imf , wind - driven mass loss in the former and the accretion of primordial metal - poor gas in the former .",
    "the flatter imf of bulge stars implies a higher relative production of o from more abundant massive stars .",
    "addition ( loss ) of mass from a star - forming system will increase ( decrease ) the amount of star formation required to arrive at a given metal abundance and therefore the c / o at that abundance .",
    "one feature of the statistics of stellar metallicities of the galactic disk in the neighborhood of the sun is the relatively narrow dispersion and paucity of metal - poor stars .",
    "this is often called the `` g dwarf problem '' and translates into a flat age - metallicity relation for the most of the history of the galactic disk , at least in the solar neighborhood .",
    "it is actually not a problem for gce models if addition of metal - poor gas to the disk is admitted to balance stellar nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if c / o is strongly correlated with metallicity then a flat age - metallicity relation might mean that c / o evolves very little ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to re - visit the question of the evolution of c / o in the solar neighborhood",
    ", the abundances of the two elements were calculated on an isotope - by - isotope basis using the model described in detail in the appendix .",
    "the model simulates the production of these isotopes and release into the ism in sn explosions , winds from massive stars and agb stars , sequestration of isotopes into long - lived low - mass stars , and addition of metal - poor gas by infall onto the galactic disk .",
    "the ism is described by two components ; an inter - cloud medium which produces molecular clouds but no stars , and a star - forming giant molecular cloud component .",
    "yields for intermediate- and massive stars are taken from a variety of recent sources .",
    "best - fit parameters describing the timescale of exponentially - declining gas infall on the disk , the initial metallicity of the infalling gas , the age of the stellar population at the solar galactocentric radius , the index of the power - law describing the imf for massive stars , and the power - law relationship between star formation rate and gas surface density were found by a monte - carlo markov chain analysis : the observational constraints were the age of the sun , the present mass surface density of stars , stellar remanants , and gas at the solar galactocentric radius , solar metallicity ( here taken to be c+o ) , the current metallicity of the ism , and its intrinsic standard deviation .",
    "the prediction evolution of c / o is compared to the solar value from @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig.co ] .",
    "after initial transients that die away after a few hundred myr , there is only moderate evolution in c / o during most of the history of the galactic disk .",
    "the c / o ratio rises from 0.5 to about 0.65 over the first 6  gyr in response to increasing input from stars of lower mass and higher metallicity , as described above , and declines slightly thereafter .",
    "the predicted value at the time of the sun s formation is 0.64 , withinin @xmath15 of the @xcite value .",
    "the formal error in the predicted value , based on the standard deviation of the mcmc chain after removal of the `` burn in '' , is only 0.003 , but this value does not reflect the dominant source of uncertainty in these calculations  the nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "although the model is unable to exactly reproduce the solar values of c and o abundances , correctly reproducing these using gce been always been challenging .",
    "@xcite also found that satisfactorily reproducing a `` flat '' c / o places constraints on the remnant or `` cut - off '' mass at the center of a sn progenitor which is not injected into the ism .",
    "figure [ fig.co2 ] plots the predicted c / o evolution vs. predicted [ o / h ] , again compared to the sun . also plotted are the values found by @xcite for galactic disk stars ( filled points ) and bulge or halo stars ( open points ) and converted to absolute values assuming a solar c / o of 0.55 .",
    "the predicted trend is perfectly consistent with the disk values if an offset of about 16% with the predicted vs. measured solar value is artificially removed .",
    "the absence of data for disk stars at low [ o / h ] is a consequence of the age - metallicity relationship : comparatively little time elapsed ( @xmath8  gyr according to the model ) and few stars formed in this interval .",
    "the predicted constancy of c / o contrasts with previous predictions for an increase in c / o with metallicity / time . for example , both @xcite and @xcite predict a positive slope of @xmath16 dex / dex in [ c / o ] vs. [ o / h ] , and thus a c / o of about 0.06 at [ o / h ] = -1 .",
    "since the model and the best - fit parameter values presented here are similar to those of previous works the most likely cause of this difference is in the particular nucleosynthetic yields that were used .",
    "the yields from agb stars have been significantly revised @xcite but in the model these are minority contributors to the c and o budgets .",
    "indeed , if there contribution is completely removed , c / o still changes little and the predicted solar c / o is slightly closer to the @xcite value . instead",
    ", the predictions of this model probably stand out from previous results because of the dominant contribution of massive stars to both c and o. since these stars have very short lives compared to the chemical evolution of the disk , there is no effect from delayed contribution , and the c / o rapidly approaches a steady - state value .",
    "previous works have pointed to favorable comparisons of model predictions with observations , but the latter are _ combined _ data on bulge , halo , and thick- and thin - disk populations , therefore assuming a common origin for these populations that may not exist .",
    "for example , the [ c / o ] of thin disk stars presented by @xcite and @xcite show no correlation with [ o / h ] and it is only when bulge and thick disk stars are added that such a correlation appears .",
    "the apparent consistency between the predicted and observed trends of [ c / o ] vs. [ o / h ] @xcite belies the fact that the models were tuned for the ( thin ) disk population in the solar neighborhood and should not be compared with other stellar populations .",
    "it is indisputable that metal - poor bulge / halo stars have low c / o compared to the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "the model presented here can not , and was not designed to , explain these populations , but their abundances might be a result of a flatter imf , early loss of gas and/or truncation of star formation .",
    "but bulge / halo stars are rare in the solar neighborhood and because their lines are very weak they are usually avoided by planet searches using the doppler radial velocity method .",
    "c / o may also vary at some level within the solar galactocentric annulus because the sources of nuclides ( stars and stellar clusters ) are discrete and mixing by rotational shear and epicyclic dynamics is not completely efficient .",
    "however , gce is occurring on a timescale much longer ( few gyr ) than the rotational time of the galaxy at 8  kpc ( @xmath17250  myr ) which governs the rate of mixing , and thus this limits the magnitude of such heterogeneities .        .",
    "the @xcite solar value is plotted as well as values for galactic disk stars ( filled points ) and bulge / halo stars ( open points ) from @xcite and tied to the solar value.,width=317 ]",
    "in solar - type stars , the absorption lines of c and o are weak and c / o has little effect on the overall spectrum .",
    "@xcite pointed out that cooler stars , i.e. brown dwarfs , offer more obvious constraints on the occurrence of high c / o systems .",
    "the spectra of m dwarfs , with effective temperatures @xmath18 @xmath19k , also include absorption bands of o - containing molecules , e.g. tio , vo , and caoh , which are sensitive to the available o abundance @xcite , and hence c / o . at c / o @xmath9 ,",
    "tio is absent and the schwan bands of c@xmath5 , cn , and ch should appear .",
    "such spectra are characteristic of carbon stars , evolved stars in which dredge - up of carbon - righ interiors has occurred ( agb stars ) .",
    "if the initial mass function of star formation is chemically invariant , a limit on the occurrence of c - rich m dwarfs is also a limit on c - rich g dwarfs .",
    "dwarf carbon ( dc ) star have been identified @xcite but these probably accreted carbon - rich gas from a present or former evolved companion @xcite .",
    "overall , dc stars are uncommon @xcite .",
    "carbon enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars in the galactic halo appear are also rare overall but more prevalent among ( initially ) metal - poor systems because less accreted c is required to increase c / o @xcite .",
    "any tally of _ intrinsically _ carbon - rich dwarfs must remove these interlopers or be considered an upper limit .",
    "i considered three spectral indices which are continuum - normalized measures of the emission in specific bands @xcite : cah , which is the mean of the cah2 ( 6814 - 6846 ) and cah3 ( 6960 - 6990 ) indices ; tio5 ( 7126 - 7135 ) ; and caoh ( 6230 - 6240 ) .",
    "values of these temperature- and gravity - sensitive indices are highly and positively correlated among solar - metallicity m dwarfs .",

    "can be written as : @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . in these equations , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50",
    "are the rate of mixing from the intercloud to the cloud medium , the rate of mixing from the cloud to the intercloud medium , the rate of grain destruction in the intercloud medium , and the rate of grain growth from molecular cloud gas , respectively",
    ". the nucleosynthetic rate of production of an element is much slower than any of the rates of the formation of clouds , dissipation of clouds , destruction by sputtering in the inter - cloud phase , and growth condensation in the cloud phase , respectively , and is ignored here .",
    "the steady state solutions are : @xmath51 and @xmath52 thus , the steady - state abundances are governed by only two parameters , the amount of growth in the clouds @xmath53 , and the amount of erosion between clouds : @xmath54 .",
    "i estimated parameter values for some elements using the data compiled by @xcite .",
    "i set @xmath55 and @xmath56 to @xmath57_1 $ ] ( maximum depletion ) and @xmath58_0 $ ] ( minimum depletion ) , respectively , and solved for @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig.rates ] plots these two parameters .",
    "three elements with data in @xcite are not shown : to explain the abundances of p , cl , and zn in the context of this model requires _ negative _ destruction in the intercloud medium .",
    "this may be an artifact of photoionization since the abundance of these elements is estimated from their singly ionized forms .",
    "the comparatively low condensation rates of kr , c , and o reflect the volatility of these elements .",
    "the behavior of o deviates strongly from that of the refractory elements , perhaps because the primary carrier of o is not silicates but a much more volatile substance such as water ice .",
    "likewise c does not behave as a refractory such as graphite @xcite .",
    "this suggests that c is present as relatively volatile organic matter @xcite .",
    "kr is not expected to condense and the non - zero value of @xmath53 may be a consequence of measurement errors or departures from solar relative abundances @xcite .    the differences in the parameters for c and o manifest themselves as a modified c / o ratio in interstellar dust with respect to the total ( gas+dust ) abundance . in the case of the nominal rates inferred from the data of @xcite ,",
    "the degree of depletion from cold molecular cloud gas shows that the c / o of the dust is 0.92 times that of the bulk ism , i.e. slightly more oxygen - rich than the current bulk ism value .",
    "although o is depleted more rapidly from interstellar grains , it is also accreted more rapidly .",
    "one caveat of this estimate for the dust c / o is that the gas - phase depletion of c is more uncertain than other elements because there are few suitable absorption lines @xcite .",
    "the c / o could also vary between locations as a result of varying @xmath54 and/or @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite estimated the residence time @xmath59 in the warm inter - cloud phase of the ism as @xmath60  yr assuming that it is set by the timescale for shocking by sn and subsequent cooling and collapse into clouds .",
    "this was consistent with an ism mass fraction in the warm phase of @xmath1710% .",
    "however , the mass in the warm phase is probably comparable to the dense molecular h@xmath5 ( cloud ) phase @xcite and thus the residence time in the inter - cloud phase is similar to the cloud lifetime @xmath61  yr @xcite . over this time",
    ", dust grains may experience @xmath62 sn shocks before becoming incorporated into molecular clouds .",
    "in contrast , @xmath53 would be expected to vary only to the extent that the lifetimes of molecular clouds varies .",
    "i estimated the sensitivity to variations in these rates by multiplying each of the parameter ratios by varying factors @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig.contour ] plots the predicted variation of c / o with contours intervals of 10% .",
    "the unadjusted parameter values , which predict [ c / o]@xmath64 ( heavy contour ) , are at unit value abcissa and ordinate ( circle ) .",
    "variation in the efficiency of grain destruction in the intercloud medium ( @xmath54 ) have more effect on dust c / o than variation in the efficiency of grain growth in molecular clouds ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this difference is a consequence of the larger dispersion ( a ratio of @xmath65 ) in the removal of o vs. c during grain destruction compared to the dispersion in the incorporation of o vs. c during grain growth ( a ratio of @xmath66 , fig .",
    "[ fig.rates ] ) . the very volatile behavior of o compared to the other elements is presumably because some of it is incorporated as water ice mantles around dust grains .",
    "this model predicts that large ( factors of two ) variation in dust lifetime produced by different shock and uv conditions in the intercloud medium will produce modest ( @xmath1720% ) variation in bulk dust c / o , with dust in the vicinity of massive sn progenitors more carbon - rich . by the arguments presented above , variation in dust c / o could generate diversity in the composition of planeteismals , but this will be limited by the extent that water ice is retained on dust grains ( see below ) .",
    "a pronounced correlation between the metallicity of the host star and the occurrence of giant planets was discovered early in the history of exoplanet science @xcite .",
    "increasingly precise measurements of the relative abundances of elements in stellar photospheres have permitted more nuanced investigations of correlations with planet occurrence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the solar composition was anomalous compared to 9 out of a sample of 11 solar `` twins '' and that the sun is deficient ( @xmath67  dex ) in refractory elements ( condensation temperature @xmath68  k ) compared to more volatile elements .",
    "they proposed that this was a signature of the sequestration of those elements in rocky planets and cores of gas giants .",
    "@xcite also found a statistical correlation between planets and a deficit of refractory elements among larger samples of solar - type stars in doppler surveys .",
    "if differences in relative photosphere abundances are a signature of rocky planets or giant planet cores , this would provide a short - cut to planet detection and even a means to probe the composition of the planets themselves @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find no clear correlation between the slope of the relative abundance vs. @xmath69 and the presence or absence of planets .",
    "one factor that may contribute to these contrasting results is the removal of galactic chemical evolution trends , e.g. decreasing [ @xmath14/fe ] with increasing metallicity , by @xcite .",
    "moroever , @xcite found no trend with @xmath69 in the relative abundances of members of the solar - age , solar - metallicity cluster m67 .",
    "observations of physical pairs of stars with and without ( detected ) planets provide the clearest test of the planet - abundance relation , as both stars should have formed from the same molecular cloud .",
    "but the available observations do unambiguously support such a correlation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the trend of increasing differential abundance with increasing condensation temperature approximately mirrors the pattern of depletion of elements in ism gas @xcite .",
    "this simply reflects the preferential condensation of refractory elements onto interstellar grains and the universality of chemistry .",
    "if interstellar dust does not perfectly follow the gas , this will produce variation in element abundances that are proportional to the extent of gas - dust segregation and the dust composition .",
    "all else being equal , the abundances of the more refractory elements ( which are mostly in the dust ) would be expected to vary more than volatile elements ( which are mostly in the gas ) , in a manner that roughly correlates with @xmath69 .",
    "there is evidence for , and theoretical predictions of , dust - gas segregation in the ism .",
    "@xcite found that the power - law describing the spatial distribution of extinction ( a tracer of the column density of dust ) on the sky is shallower than that of @xmath70co ( a tracer of the gas column density ) , such that in the densest regions of the ism , extinction by dust is less than that predicted by perfect correspondence with the gas .",
    "this could be explained by grain growth in excess of that predicted by models .",
    "( co condensation would presumably act in the opposite sense * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "but @xcite offer spatial variation in dust - to - gas ratio as an alternative explanation .",
    "dust - gas segregation could occur at three different scales ; ( i ) over the extent of a giant molecular cloud or star - forming region ; ( ii ) in cloud cores that collapse to form individual stellar systems ; and ( iii ) in the accretion disks around young stellar objects . @xcite",
    "estimated that dust drift due to radiation pressure from o stars can remove dust from the centers of h ii regions in @xmath71  myr , but since such low - density regions are not themselves the site of star formation , this effect should not manifest itself in the relative abundances of stellar photospheres .",
    "@xcite showed that the different dynamics of dust and gas during bondi - type accretion flow can enhance dust - to - gas ratios by an order of magnitude in cloud cores .",
    "the mechanism modeled by @xcite relies on dust velocities of several km  sec@xmath72 relative to the gas around the growing cloud core . the size distribution of interstellar dust grains peaks sharply near 0.2 - 0.3 @xmath25 m @xcite .",
    "these grains may be dynamically decoupled from the diffuse interstellar medium ( number density @xmath73 @xmath74 , stopping distance @xmath75  pc ) , and there is tentative evidence for this in the trajectories of interstellar meteors @xcite and _ ulysses _ spacecraft measurements @xcite .",
    "however , these grains will be tightly coupled to the molecular gas ( @xmath76  @xmath74 ) surrounding a cloud core , i.e. over length scales @xmath4  pc and much smaller than a typical cloud size . under such conditions",
    "it seems unlikely that dust acceleration mechanisms ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) can achieve equipartion of energy between ism and dust and speeds of @xmath1710  km  s@xmath72 .    the second scenario which could produce variation in the dust - to - gas ratio in cloud cores is drift induced by radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite showed that the inward radial drift of 0.1-@xmath25 m grains under the influence of a typical radiation field can treble the dust concentration in a static gas sphere of a few solar masses at 10  k in 10  myr .",
    "the effect scales linearly with the intensity of the external radiation field and the inverse of the characteristic cloud column density .",
    "grains reach terminal velocity on a timescale of @xmath10  yr , i.e. much shorter than the cloud lifetime .",
    "thus any density enhancement can be expected to grow linearly and the total dust enhancement can be expected to scale with the total external radiation experienced by the cloud core over its lifetime . @xcite",
    "numerically simulated this effect , including gas dynamics as well as coupling between the gas and dust , and found that the dust concentration is enhanced by about an order of magnitude in a narrow , inward - propagating shell , and depleted exterior to that shell .",
    "while the mean dust - to - gas ratio of a cloud is not changed by migration , truncation of the cloud by photoevaporation or internal collapse ( to the exclusion of outer regions ) would produce a metal - enhanced object .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite point out the relevance of this process to the metallicities of stars and the formation of their planets .",
    "a third scenario for dust - gas segregation involves accreting protostars and their disks , or concomitant bondi - hoyle accretion from the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "photoevaporation of gas , but not dust , from a disk produces an enhancement in the dust - to - gas ratio which is inherited by the star as disk accretion continues .",
    "photoevaporation of disks driven by x - rays from the central star has been proposed to explain the final , rapid stage of circumstellar disk clearing @xcite .",
    "observations of blue - shifted lines of ne ii @xcite and o i @xcite indicate that heavy volatile elements as well as h and he are lost in these winds .",
    "the temperature of the x - ray - heated `` surface '' of the disk from which the winds flow is heated to a few thousand k @xcite , but gravitational settling ( and the formation of planetesimals ) keeps dust near the cooler mid - plane .",
    "disk masses are typically 1% of the central star , with a large scatter @xcite ; assuming the convection zone of a young solar - mass star contains 0.1m@xmath12 , accretion of an entire disk which has been severaly gas - depleted would increase relative elemental abundances by @xmath77 dex , or @xmath78 dex if the convection zone contains 0.4m@xmath12 .",
    "this may fall short of explaining some of the observations .",
    "two important clues to the mechanism(s ) of the observed variation are the spatial scale on which the variation occurs , and the @xmath69 of the `` elbow '' in the relative abundance variation below which abundances do not vary in any systematic manner .",
    "surveys of nearby , solar - age field stars offer little information on the spatial scale of the segregation as the stars are far from their birthplace .",
    "@xcite found no significant difference between m67 cluster stars and the sun , and proposed that the sun also formed in a dense cluster analogous to m67 .",
    "they suggested that the common pattern of relative abundances was established by the removal of dust by radiation drift .",
    "but there are several problems with this explanation",
    ". star formation does not take place in hii regions but in surrounding neutral gas , and , as they point out , the expansion of an hii region should outpace dust drift .",
    "this explanation also requires most stars to form after an earlier generation of massive stars that move the dust .",
    "it also requires that the vast majority of nearby solar - type stars have _ not _ formed in dense stellar clusters , something not supported by cluster statistics @xcite .",
    "finally , abundance differences between stars in physical pairs requires gas - dust segregation on scales smaller than the cloud core .",
    "the other clue is the value @xmath69 below which relative abundance variation disappears , as this suggests the temperature and hence location where the dust and gas segregation occurs .",
    "if this `` knee '' in the abundance variation vs. @xmath69 is 1000  k , as many data sets suggest @xcite , this would seem to rule out a molecular cloud setting with @xmath79  k where even some c and o condense as organics and ices .",
    "all of these observations point to gas - dust segregation during the formation or subsequent evolution of an accretion disk as a plausible explanation of the abundance trends .",
    "neither observations of m dwarfs nor models of galactic chemical evolution support the premise that there are a significant number of stellar systems with primordial c / o @xmath16 in the solar neighborhood , i.e. within the samples of doppler radial velocity surveys . moreover , if the process of planet formation is universal , then studies of primitive meteorites show that the chemical composition of small , rocky planets is controlled largely by the composition and thermal processing of pre - existing dust from the parent molecular cloud , rather than condensation from gas with the stellar composition , and that this dust is likely to have a c / o reflecting that of the bulk ism . finally , small differences in the relative patterns between the sun and solar `` twins '' can best be explained by dust - gas segregation at stellar scales and temperatures of up to 1000  k , i.e. in accreting protostars , rather than planet formation per se .    when comparing the sun to the solar neighborhood it is usually assumed that they share a common history .",
    "however , it is also possible that the two are not related .",
    "@xcite estimated `` cosmic '' standard abundances ( rather the present - day abundances in the solar neighborhood ) using bright , slowly - rotating , early - type b stars . due to their short main sequence lives ,",
    "b stars contain abundance information that is both contemparaneous and local , and their purely radiative atmospheres are comparatively simple to model , although uv photoionization rates must be correctly modeled @xcite .",
    "@xcite report metallicities that are very close to solar , depsite 4.5  gyr of intervening gce , and a mean c / o of 0.37 , lower than the solar value of 0.55 .",
    "they explain both discrepancies by appealing to outward migration of the sun in the galactic disk .",
    "these findings warrant further investigation .",
    "depletion patterns in the ism suggest that the c / o of dust largely reflects the ism ; o is incorporated more rapidly in grains than c in molecular clouds but it is depleted from grains more quickly in the intercloud medium , and these two effects approximately balance .",
    "variation in the efficiency of grain erosion by sn shocks and uv radiation could produce modest variations in the c / o , however .",
    "while the phases of o in interstellar grains are clearly water ice and silicates , the phases of c are more controversial .",
    "volatility patterns suggest c is _ not _ in refractory phase(s ) like graphite and carbides but instead more volatile organic molecules , in particular aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "aliphatic hydrocarbons have been suggested as the source of the ubiquitious ism absorbtion feature at 3.4@xmath25 m but the absence of polarization in this line is difficult to reconcile with a scenario of condensation of carbonaceous mantles onto silicate cores @xcite .",
    "surface reactions could explain why growth rate of c in grains is very slow with respect to other elements .",
    "while these considerations plus a bulk ism c / o@xmath8 are sufficient to explain the oxidized nature of dust in the solar system , it remains to be explained why primitive meteorites in the solar system are very depleted in both c and o , especially c. based on the meteorite abundances and associated uncertainties compiled by @xcite and solar abundances and uncertainties from @xcite , the depletion has a stochiometric ratio of @xmath80 , i.e. consistent with unity and depletion by the formation and removal of co. in this scenario the removal of c or o is not controlled by volatility , otherwise either c or o would be far more depleted than the other , depending on the effective @xmath69 .",
    "this can occur if the reaction occurs in situ , i.e. at temperatures lower than the @xmath69s of the c and o phases ( @xmath81k ) where both elements are retained in grains , and/or where vapor is not lost by turbulent mixing , i.e. in `` dead zone '' where turbulence is suppressed .",
    "primitive meteorites , considered analogs to the now - lost building blocks of the solar system , also include the highly - reduced enstatite chondrites .",
    "enstatite chondrites contain carbide minerals but virtually no water and have been explained by equilibration of solids with a gas having c / o = 0.83 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , removal of an amount of c and o equal to that incorporated in ci chondrites produces a residual gas with a c / o of 0.93 .",
    "@xcite have proposed that removal of refractories from a gas of solar composition and equilibration of solids with the remaining gas could produce the precursors for enstatite chondrites .",
    "if enstatite chondrites formed from recycling of the precursors of terrestrial planets in an oxygen - poor gas it could explain why the enstatite chondrites and earth lie along the same mass - dependent fractionation line in a three oxygen - isotope plot .",
    "this equilibration would necessarily have occurred at a comparatively low dust - to - gas ratio and lower temperatures where moderately volatile elements such as fe would not be lost .",
    "al - mg isotopes of cais in unequilibrated enstatite chondrites indicate that these refractory inclusions formed in the same region as cais in other chondrites , but were subsequently exposed to reducing conditions @xcite .",
    "reducing conditions could have been established sequentially or in a different part of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the formation times of enstatite chondrites is an area of active research .",
    "dating of sulfides in unequilibrated e chondrites using the fe - ni and mn - cr short - lived radionuclide chronometers gives ages of 12 - 13 myr after cai formation @xcite .",
    "re - analysis of the mn - cr isotope data for a single sulfide in the macalpine hills 88136 el3 chondrite @xcite plus an initial @xmath82mn/@xmath83mn of @xmath84 @xcite gives an age of 10  myr .    in summary , i propose the following scenario for the chemistry of rocky planets :    * planet formation proceeds from a two - component ism ( gas and dust ) which are never fully equilibraxted during the formation process . *",
    "the composition of the precursor material of solar system material is interstellar dust with refractory abundances and a c / o ratio approximately equal to the bulk ism ; this was set by grain growth in molecular clouds and destruction between clouds .",
    "* planetesimals , as represented by carbonaceous ( ci ) chondrites , formed under the oxidizing , high dust - to - gas ratio conditions established by settling of interstellar grains to the disk mid - plane and subsequent depletion of c and o by formation and removal of co. * enstatite chondrites represent reduced material that equilibrated with gas after removal of solids in approximately ci proportions , possibly during a second generation of planetesimal formation . * the chemical composition of rocky exoplanets could be set by mixing of oxidized and reduced generations of planetesimals .",
    "the mixing ratio could be determined by the effiency with which the first , oxidizing generation incorporated disk solids , as well as the dynamics of accretion in the disk .",
    "giant planets , unlike the small , rocky planets considered in this work , accrete massive gas envelopes that would include volatile species such as co , and the considerations described above do not preclude the possibility of c - rich atmospheres in giant planets .",
    "detections of such objects have been claimed , but are controversial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the core - first model of giant planet formation is correct , removal of o as silicates and sequestration into a core increases the c / o ratio of the gas that is subsequently captured into the planet s envelope . beyond the ice - line , condensation of water and removal of more o would drive the c / o of the gas even closer to unity @xcite .",
    "dissociation of co in the disk and removal of the o as water ice would further enhance this ratio , and indeed the enrichment of planetary water in @xmath85o and @xmath86o relative to the sun is thought to be a signature of this process @xcite .",
    "these processes may facilitate the formation of reduced , enstatite chondrite - like planetesimals as discussed above .",

    "the ism is described by a two - box model with a lower - density , warmer intercloud medium ( icm ) which spawns molecular clouds , and a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) component that can form stars .",
    "the mean lifetime of molecular clouds is @xmath89 and the residence time of gas in the icm before condensing into a cloud is @xmath90 .",
    "the equations of motion for the mass surface density @xmath91 of the two components are : @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the infall rate , @xmath95 is the rate of formation rate of stars with @xmath96m@xmath12 , @xmath97 is the ratio of the total stellar mass to the mass in stars @xmath98m@xmath12 , @xmath99 is the flux of sn ejecta into the icm from progenitors that explode in time @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the flux of sn ejecta into the parent molecular cloud from progenitors that contribute to gmcs in time @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the wind from agb stars , all contributing to the icm .",

    "the c / o ratio is calculated by summing the appropriate mass fractions divided by the atomic weights .",
    "an approximate metallicity is also calcated from the sum of all the isotopes relative to the abundances in the sun .",

    "the literature for sn and agb nucleosynthesis is very heterogeneous , with calculations performed for different ranges / values of progenitor masses and metallicities , and it was necessary to interpolate or extrapolate for some values .",
    "specifically , to estimate the production of 6.5m@xmath12 agb stars with sub - solar progenitor metallicities i scaled the @xcite values for sub - solar metallicity 6m@xmath12 progenitors by the ratio of the 6.5m@xmath12 to 6m@xmath12 production for solar - metallicity . for productions from super - agb stars with progenitor masses outside the caclulated range , i either used the production from the most massive progenitor with the same metallicity , or linearly interpolated between the values for the most massive agb and least massive super - agb progenitors with the same metallicity . for a review of the many parameters and uncertainties that enter these calculations",
    "see @xcite .",

    "[ eqn.production ] and [ eqn.iso_production ] .",
    "i searched for the parameter values that best reproduce the observational constraints using monte - carlo markov chain analysis .",
    "the constraints are the age of the sun , the present mass surface densities of stars , stellar remnants , and total gas at the solar galactocentric radius , solar c / o , the current metallicity of the ism ( taken to be + 0.14 based on the metallicities of m44 and the hyades ) , and the mean ( -0.05 ) and intrinsic standard - deviation ( 0.18 dex ) of the metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",

    "i varied the exponential infall timescale , the metallicity of the infalling material , the age of the galactic disk in the solar annulus , the high - mass imf index @xmath14 , and the schmidt - kennicut index @xmath130 .",
    "the simulation is able to adequately reproduce the observed properties of the galactic disk in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath131 with @xmath132 ) .",
