    "the ebic collection efficiency increases with electron beam energy more rapidly than observed experimentally .",

    "we consider this to be a signature of surface recombination from charged surfaces .",
    "reducing the doping density to @xmath87 in the model yields a better fit to experimental data .",
    "we also find that to obtain the best fit to experimental data , the value of the mobility @xmath55 must be substantially lower than the expected si mobility ( we use @xmath94 , see table 1 ) . since most of the carrier transport occurs near the sample surface , it is plausible that for the fib - prepared sample the mobility of carriers near the surface is substantially less than the bulk mobility , due to disorder introduced in the sample surface preparation .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that other factors are responsible for the experimental observations .",

    "we have also studied the possibility of bulk recombination in the depletion region as a mechanism for the reduced ebic efficiency , but this recombination mechanism would apply in an operational device , which would be inconsistent with the high short circuit current density of the devices . for these reasons , we believe that charged surface defect levels are the most likely explanation for the reduced ebic efficiency observed in these materials .",
    "if indeed surface fields significantly impact an ebic measurement , then conclusions drawn from these measurements should be framed in the context of a surface field .",
    "for example , the observations that excitations at grain boundaries result in higher ebic collection efficiency than excitations in grain interiors may be used to conclude that grain boundaries are not recombination centers _ in the presence of surface fields _ @xcite . the extent",
    "to which this qualification modifies the conclusions about grain boundaries in the bulk is not clear _ a priori _ , and we leave this as a subject for future study .",
    "we also note that the presence and magnitude of surface fields likely depends on sample preparation methods .",
    "we suggest that measuring the maximum ebic efficiency as a function of electron beam energy is one way to determine if surface fields are present in a particular sample , but acknowledge that a definitive conclusion about the presence of surface fields is generally difficult .",
    "in summary , we ve developed a model of the ebic response to excitations in the depletion region which includes surface recombination from neutral and charged surfaces .",
    "this model is motivated by observations that , under certain experimental conditions , the maximum ebic collection efficiency is substantially less than 100  % and varies throughout the depletion region .",
    "a comparison between the model and si samples offers clear indication of the role of surface effects in ebic experiments , and how they depend on sample preparation methods . a particularly useful and common application of low energy , high resolution ebic is probing the characteristics of polycrystalline photovoltaics .",
    "however the interpretation of the ebic response in these materials is complicated by the presence of grain boundaries . using a simpler material such as",
    "si offers a cleaner interpretation of surface effects and development of surface models .",
    "ultimately these surface models can be applied to more complex materials , enabling a determination of properties of grain boundary and subsurface interfaces .",
    "moreover , models of the ebic response at the sample surface can be readily applied to internal surfaces ( e.g. grain boundaries ) , so that the formulas and qualitative descriptions given here may be applied to studies of grain boundaries as well .",
