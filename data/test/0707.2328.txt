    "during the past few years , there has been a tremendous increase in research activities devoted to single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) mainly because of their extraordinary mechanical , electrical , and chemical properties .",
    "future nanoscale applications will however necessitate the production of pure swnts in significant quantities and also the selective formation of nanotubes with well - defined chirality or diameter .",
    "this obviously requires to understand their growth mechanisms .",
    "swnts are generally produced via techniques working at high temperatures ( arc discharge @xcite , laser ablation @xcite ) or at medium temperature ( chemical vapor deposition @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a transition metal catalyst ( such as fe , co , ni , @xmath0 ) has been found necessary for the synthesis of swnts but the exact role played by the catalyst is still unclear .",
    "the similarities between the samples synthesized from different techniques suggest a common growth mechanism and the so - called vapor - liquid - solid ( vls ) model is frequently mentioned @xcite . in this scheme , the growth of swnts begins with the formation of a metallic particle supersaturated with carbon ; then carbon segregates towards the surface and finally carbonaceous structures emerge from the catalyst surface . from the theoretical side , several modelizations at an atomic scale",
    "have been performed using either phenomenological potentials @xcite or first principles methods @xcite .    to some extent these computer simulation",
    "works confirm the vls model but with some differences between the high temperature and medium temperature routes . in chemical vapor deposition methods",
    "the size of the tubes is generally determined by the size of the particle .",
    "actually several modelizations show that carbon atoms at the surface self - organize and form graphene - like sheets wrapping the particle .",
    "once formed these sheets no longer interact with metallic atoms and can detach to form nanotubes .",
    "this accounts for a so - called tangential process . in other situations , principally within the high temperature route , bundles of nanotubes grow perpendicularly to the surface and it is still a challenge to understand why this can be more advantageous than a tangential growth .    some arguments based on classical nucleation and growth thermodynamic models have already been put forward @xcite .",
    "carbon atoms at the surface of the metallic catalyst are assumed to condense in the form of graphene flakes .",
    "then the metallic substrate can help to saturate the dangling bonds and this is presumably favoured by the formation of a cap , the energy cost due to the curvature induced by the presence of pentagons , being more than compensated by the reduction of the number of dangling bonds @xcite .",
    "this model has been substantiated by fan _",
    "@xcite who performed _ ab initio _ energy calculations of different arrangements of carbon atoms on a ni(100 ) surface . among the different carbon geometries tested",
    ", they found actually that the most stable one is a hemispherical cap forming a tube embryo .",
    "these calculations are quite accurate but computationally very demanding and the structures can not be fully relaxed . furthermore these calculations do not provide an easy access to a local analysis of the bonding .",
    "have thus developed a simplified phenomenological analysis of the energies to characterize this effect of dangling bond saturation  @xcite .",
    "a more precise analysis of the chirality fixed by the embryos growing on a ( 111 ) surface has been made by reich _",
    "@xcite based on the use of the siesta _ ab initio _ code .",
    "they confirm the bond saturation effect and show that the possible chiral selectivity depends more on the carbon - metal bonds than on the energy of the different carbon caps . in this calculation however , the metallic ( nickel ) atoms remain unrelaxed , a strong approximation , considering the order of magnitude of the nic interaction , and no local energy analysis can either be achieved .    in this paper",
    ", we study the adhesive properties of carbon clusters on a ni(100 ) surface using a tight - binding ( tb ) total energy model .",
    "this model relies on local ( atomic ) energy calculations using the recursion method and is coupled with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in order to relax the structures .",
    "our objective is to establish if the nucleation of swnts is favoured by the elimination of dangling bonds , as suggested by the above mentioned authors and also to discuss the role of the displacements of the metallic atoms .",
    "we thus present an analysis of the local energy distributions in order to determine which atoms ( carbon or nickel ) , and to what extent , are stabilized when various carbon clusters are put in contact with a metallic surface .",
    "in our study , the interaction between metal ( here nickel ) and carbon atoms is treated within the semi - empirical tight - binding model described in ref .",
    "@xcite . only _",
    "s _ , _ p _ electrons of carbon and _ d _ electrons of nickel are taken into account .",
    "the total energy of an atom @xmath1 is splitted in two parts , a band structure term that describes the formation of an energy band when atoms are put together and a repulsive term that empirically accounts for the ionic and electronic repulsions : @xmath2 the total energy of the system , @xmath3 , then writes : @xmath4 the band energy , @xmath5 , is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the fermi level and @xmath8 is the atomic energy level .",
    "we use the recursion method to calculate the local electronic density of states @xmath9 on each site @xcite .",
    "only the first four continued fraction coefficients , ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) corresponding to the first four moments of the local density of states are calculated exactly .",
    "the continued fraction is then expanded to the @xmath14 using constant coefficient equal to @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( here @xmath15 ) . the local density of states @xmath9",
    "is then expressed as a set of @xmath16 poles ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) with weights ( @xmath19 , @xmath18 ) by diagonalizing a tridiagonal matrix of size @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the band energy of an atom @xmath1 writes : @xmath20 in the above equation the highest occupied energy level @xmath21 depends on each site @xmath1 .",
    "the set of c  c , ni  ni and ni  c tight - binding interaction parameters used was shown to be transferable to different atomic configurations by comparison with _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "it reproduces the expected phase separation tendency for the ni - c alloy , with an enthalpy of mixing of + 1.0 ev / atom for nic in the ( metastable ) rocksalt structure fitted to _",
    "ab initio _ data ( abinit code ) .",
    "the heat of solution of a c atom in a ni matrix is then found equal to + 0.4 ev / atom , in agreement with the experimental value of shelton _",
    "( 0.49 ev / atom @xcite ) and the first principles calculations of siegel _ et al . _",
    "( + 0.2 - 0.35 ev / atom @xcite ) .",
    "more details are given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this approach which correctly describes the chemical bonds of a mixed metal - carbon system , is able to deal with systems of a few hundreds of atoms over large time scales .",
    "as compared to the standard diagonalization technique , the recursion method is local and then gives direct access to the total energy of each atom @xmath1 ( see eq.[eqn : equation4 ] ) .",
    "this possibility to easily analyze local energy distributions will be very useful in the following .",
    "this atomic interaction model is then implemented in a monte carlo code , based on the metropolis algorithm , which allows to relax the structures @xcite .",
    "finally different tests were performed to check the reliability of our model . as an example , a simple relaxation of c atoms covering a ni(100 ) surface induced the  clock \" reconstruction observed experimentally by klink _",
    "this reconstruction has also been studied theoretically @xcite and corresponds to the rotation of the four ni atoms surrounding a c atom in an ni(100 ) surface , clockwise and counterclockwise alternatively ( see fig .",
    "[ figclock ] )     symmetry.,width=302 ]    in a previous study , we presented grand canonical monte carlo simulations of the dissolution and segregation of c in the presence of a ni(111 ) surface @xcite in order to understand the processes involved in the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes . at finite temperature ( 1000 and 1500 k )",
    ", we analyzed the self - organization of carbon atoms close to a nickel surface and identified a succession of four types of configurations , corresponding to an increase of the carbon chemical potential ( and consequently an increase of the number of carbon atoms ) : single c atoms adsorbed on the surface or incorporated in interstitial sites , chains creeping on the surface , detached @xmath22 c layers and finally a 3d amorphous c phase .",
    "here , we use monte carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble ( with a fixed number of ni and c atoms ) to relax the atomic structures and analyze the stability of specific carbon structures deposited on a nickel surface .",
    "we perform mc simulations on a ni slab presenting a ( 100 ) surface .",
    "this is a four - layer slab of 288 atoms , with bond lengths of 2.48  , separated by a 20   thick vacuum region along the @xmath23 axis and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the slab size is 17.60 @xmath24 19.36 @xmath24 5.28 @xmath25 .",
    "we consider several configurations of carbon atoms , with bond lengths of 1.42  , deposited on the metallic surface : molecules ( c@xmath26 and c@xmath27 rings ) , a finite linear chain of 12 atoms parallel to the surface , flat flakes of 24 and 54 atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ figclusters]a  b ) and curved structures such as a flake of 20 atoms containing a pentagon ( see fig .  [ figclusters]c ) and the cap of a ( 6 , 6 ) tube ( see fig .  [",
    "figclusters]d ) .",
    "first , we study the stability of these carbon clusters in the presence of the metallic substrate at 500 k. at this temperature , the c@xmath26 and c@xmath27 rings are dissociated to present c - c bonds of roughly 2.2  and c - ni bonds of 1.9  .",
    "the twofold coordinated atoms belonging to the finite linear chain interact moderately with the metallic surface ( in the 1.0 ev / atom range ) , while we observe that end of chain , one - fold coordinated , c atom tends to penetrate the metallic substrate , to occupy a semi - octahedral site of the ni(100 ) surface .",
    "this process has also been observed experimentally by fujii _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the stability of the clusters seems to depend on the number of of c - c bonds , with a large enough number of such bonds resulting in a stable cluster . for small number of c - c bonds , the competition between the formation of a carbide and the phase separation results in the formation of a ni - c alloy . for the other structures ,",
    "the number of c - c bonds is large enough to stabilize the carbon clusters despite the presence of the metallic surface .",
    "the flakes of 24 ( fig .",
    "[ figclusters]a ) and 54 ( fig .",
    "[ figclusters]b ) atoms remain in plane and we also do not observe any dissociation for the flake of 20 atoms containing a pentagon ( fig .",
    "[ figclusters]b ) .",
    "the presence of this defect induces a curvature of the structure in agreement with euler s theorem .",
    "last , the interaction between the metallic particle and the open tube cap stabilizes it by preventing its closure ( fig .",
    "[ figclusters]d ) .",
    "we then calculate the adhesion energies per carbon atom , @xmath28 , given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the number of ni and c atoms .",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the total energies ( per atom ) of the carbon - covered ni slab at different surface coverages , the clean ni slab and the relevant isolated carbon structure , respectively .",
    "they are calculated at 0 k on fully relaxed configurations . in each case , the minimum energy structures are obtained by performing simulated annealing . in this process the initial atomic configuration , initially at high temperature ( 1000 k ) , is slowly cooled down so that the system is at any step at thermodynamic equilibrium . the major advantage of this method is its ability to avoid becoming trapped in local minima .",
    "typical runs consist in 10@xmath25 external monte carlo loops , each of them randomly performing 10@xmath25 atomic displacements trials .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     as the coverage exceeds 0.33 ml , the surface undergoes a reconstruction known as the  clock reconstruction \" described previously ( fig .",
    "[ figclock ] ) .",
    "this reconstruction , which has also been studied theoretically @xcite , is indeed observed during our mc calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fighistoni ] ) .",
    "the adhesive properties of carbon clusters on ni(100 ) surface then result from a competition between the formation of ni - c and c - c bonds . for structures containing few c - c bonds ,",
    "the competition between a carbide and a demixed system favors the formation of ni - c bonds and the c atoms occupy the hollow sites of ni(100 ) present at the surface . for planar flakes ,",
    "c - c interactions predominate and , as described above , the weak energy of adhesion is principally related to the energy gain of the ( reconstructed ) metallic surface below the flakes .",
    "tube embryos have an intermediate behaviour : c - c interactions predominate on the caps and ni - c anchoring bonds predominate at their edges .",
    "it is interesting to compare briefly our results with those obtained for the ( 111 ) surface . at low carbon concentration",
    "the situation is similar , with predominant ni - c interactions , even if , due to the different topology of the surfaces , the preferred position for the ( 111 ) surface for carbon is a subsurface octahedral site . at higher concentration",
    "we expect the formation of a graphene sheet in quasi perfect epitaxial relationship with the ni substrate and a vanishingly small energy of adhesion @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the energy of adhesion of a small flat cluster made of 24 atoms . as in the case of the ( 100 ) surface",
    "we find a weak energy of adhesion equal to -0.26 ev / c atom , and the local energy analyses show that the energy gain is concentrated on the edge atoms , without any important saturation of the dangling bonds . in their analysis of different caps on ni",
    "( 111 ) reich _ et al .",
    "_ have also noticed that the relative energies involved are also fairly weak @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented tight - binding monte carlo simulations of the interaction of carbon structures with ni(100 ) surfaces our calculations show that during the first stages of the nucleation the incorporation of defects and the anchoring of carbon atoms to the surface are energetically favorable . even in the presence of a metal substrate , the carbon dangling bonds parallel to the surface still exist and the metal - carbon system gains energy by reconstructing the underlying metallic surface , close to the well - known clock reconstruction . for curved structures ,",
    "the formation ni - c bonds is more efficient , and c atoms prefer to be located in semi - octahedral sites of ni present at the surface",
