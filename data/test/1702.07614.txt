    "the efficiency of a crystal as a scintillator is parametrized by the light yield ( ly ) , defined as the number of photons emitted per unit of absorbed energy . a remarkable aspect outlined by different studies",
    "@xcite is that the @xmath1/@xmath2 ly of a crystal is not constant with the energy deposited inside the lattice .",
    "this characteristic , referred to as _ non - proportionality _ , prevents the correct reconstruction of the absorbed energy , affecting the energy calibration .",
    "moreover , the ly dependency on energy strongly affects the intrinsic component of the scintillator energy resolution @xcite .",
    "events having the same nominal energy can in fact result in multiple depositions differently affected by the _ non - proportionality _ , causing a final broadening of the energy peaks .    in recent years",
    "great importance has been given to the study of _ non - proportionality _ , because of its correlation with the attainable energy resolution of scintillation crystals @xcite .    in order to fully understand this feature ,",
    "different crystals have been characterized , exciting the scintillation both with @xmath1 rays and charged particles , such as @xmath3s , @xmath2s and ions . in order to characterize the crystal independently from the detector ,",
    "the ly _ non - proportionality _ has been measured as a relative variation with respect to the ly at the 662 kev @xmath1 line , referred to as _ relative light yield _",
    "( @xmath4 ) .",
    "as the excitation energy lowers , the @xmath4 increases for iodine crystals ( nai and csi for example ) and lowers for oxide crystals ( lso and bgo for example ) @xcite .",
    "moreover the @xmath4 is bigger in crystals characterized by worst energy resolution @xcite : as a consequence , the _ non - proportionality _ appears to be the fundamental limit to the attainable scintillators energy resolution .",
    "a definite theoretical explanation for the _ non - proportionality _ is not available and in recent years three phenomena have been addressed to as possible causes @xcite : the energy dependence of the relaxation channels , the landau fluctuations of the stopping power and the secondary electrons ( @xmath5-ray ) scattering .",
    "these models ascribe the observed _ non - proportionality _ to an actual change in ly , depending on the influence of intrinsic characteristics of crystals on the electrons / holes diffusion inside the lattice .",
    "these models generally predicts the behaviour of crystals , but can not give explanation to some particular features , such as the change of @xmath4 obtained with a change in the shaping time chosen for the scintillation pulse @xcite .",
    "in particular , the choice of larger shaping times both enhances the intrinsic energy resolution and reduces the @xmath4 .",
    "as a consequence , in this paper an in depth study of the _ non - proportionality _ dependence on shaping time is presented , in order to understand how deep this relation is .",
    "the compton coincidence technique ( cct ) has been used to measure the @xmath4 of three crystals with different time and light output characteristics ( see table [ cprop ] ) : cdwo@xmath0 , bgo , and nai(tl ) .",
    "the point in the application of this technique is that it allows the analysis of the crystal response to electrons @xcite .",
    "since the scintillation mechanism is based on the electron diffusion and recombination @xcite , the cct allows an in depth analysis of this phenomenon .",
    ".crystal properties table .",
    "data were taken from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as previously said , the ly _ non - proportionality _ has been measured as a relative variation with respect to the light yield at the 662 kev @xmath1 line , referred to as _ relative light yield _ ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the obtained variable is given by the following expression : @xmath6    according to the current knowledge @xcite , both the cdwo@xmath7 and bgo crystals should present a negative _ non - proportionality _ , and their @xmath4 should decrease when the deposited energy lowers . on the other hand , the nai(tl ) crystal should be positively non - proportional , thus its @xmath4 should increase when the deposited energy lowers ( see figure [ nonproplit ] ) .           crystal digitized by the adc at 60  mhz . ]",
    "as reported in @xcite the choice of the shaping time ( st ) used to shape the light signals can change the slope of the _ non - proportionality _ curve . to evaluate the actual effect of st , it has been chosen to apply a digital pulse processing algorithm ( dpp ) to the acquired preamplified scintillator pulses .",
    "this strategy allows to check the effects of different shaping times , without acquiring multiple measurements for every configuration .",
    "the developed algorithm implements the trapezoidal filtering of the acquired pulses and is based on the procedure adopted in @xcite .",
    "the transfer function of the filter , expressed in the z - transform domain , is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of samples used for rise and decay times , @xmath10 is the number of samples used for the flat top and @xmath11 is the factor responsible for the zero - pole cancellation . since the flat top was affected by noise fluctuations , it has been chosen to use a trapezoidal filter with no flat top , referred to as triangular filter ( see figure [ trapezoidalexample ] ) .",
    "in addition to the dpp technique , the digitalized preamplified pulses were also integrated numerically .",
    "this operation allows to estimate the amplitude of the light pulse without selecting a defined bandwidth , thus including the majority of the scintillation components .",
    "the results obtained for the _ non - proportionality _ behaviour with different sts , for cdwo@xmath7 , bgo and nai(tl ) crystals are reported respectively in figure [ rlycdwo ] , [ rlybgo ] and [ rlynai ] . from these data it can be inferred that the _ non - proportionality _ of scintillation crystals is determined by the st used to process the light signal . choosing a longer shaping time , in fact ,",
    "causes all the studied crystals to be negatively non - proportional , while choosing a shorter shaping time causes the same crystals to be positively non - proportional .",
    "the transition between negative and positive deviation is different for each studied crystal , and it is related to the time characteristics of its scintillation .",
    "for example , on one hand the cdwo@xmath7 , which has a main scintillation time constant of @xmath12  @xmath13s , shows negative _ non - proportionality _ for st@xmath1410  @xmath15 . on the other hand the bgo , which has a main time constant of @xmath16  ns , shows negative deviations for st@xmath1450  ns .",
    "the obtained results show a clear correlation between the _ non - proportionality _ behaviour with energy and the st chosen to filter the light pulses .",
    "the observed behaviour can be explained by a dependence with energy of the involved scintillation component : faster components are predominant at lower energies , while higher energy events are characterized by longer scintillation times .",
    "this can be ascribed to an eventual enrolment mechanism of the activation sites in the crystal lattice : on one hand , the deposition of small energies activates just few sites characterized by a short decay time ; on the other hand , an event with higher energy causes the activation of different recombination sites , with both short and long characteristic times . as a consequence",
    "it could be inferred a sort of hierarchy between the recombination sites , ruled by the energy of the activation event and by its ionizing potential .",
    "the effect of the st is evident , since it causes the _ non - proportionality _ to space in a range between 0.5 and 2.5 . as expected ,",
    "integrating the preamplifier signal causes the crystal to loose its _ non - proportionality_. ]    , all the st@xmath1450  ns give the same effects , and a longer st ( 10  @xmath15 ) return a negative r@xmath17 . at high energies the r@xmath17 is lower than 1 , because the small size of the used bgo crystal ( 2x2x2@xmath18 ) did not allow the complete absorption of the electrons energy . ]     and 5@xmath15 cause the observed behaviour to change from the literature studies ( figure [ nonproplit ] ) . ]",
    "a detailed study of the _ non - proportionality _ behaviour with energy of three different scintillation crystals ( cdwo@xmath0 , bgo and nai ) has been performed . the relation between _ non - proportionality _ and st has been characterized by the means of a dpp algorithm , which allowed to test different integration times on the same measurement .",
    "the obtained results suggest that the _ non - proportionality _ in light yield of scintillation crystals is not an intrinsic characteristics of the crystal itself : as a matter of fact , it depends on which part of the scintillation spectrum is considered in the pulse processing , since different scintillation components are selected by different sts .    in the framework of high resolving scintillation detectors",
    ", this evidence can be used to tune the analysis strategy for the light pulses , optimizing the spectrometric performances of these crystals . on the other hand ,",
    "this peculiar characteristics has to be further investigated , in order to enlighten the hidden characteristics of the scintillation mechanism of crystals .",
