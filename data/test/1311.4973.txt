    "we define the third and fourth moment variations of financial asset return process and examine the properties of the variations .",
    "the third moment variation is defined to be a quadratic covariation between squared return and return process and the fourth moment variation is defined to be a quadratic variation of squared return process .",
    "it is demonstrated that the variations can be used as approximations for the third and fourth moments of the return distribution , which are generally hard to measure , under certain conditions .",
    "skewness , the third standardized moment , has long been an important topic in financial study and there are numerous evidences that stock return distributions are left skewed under both physical and risk - neutral probability .",
    "@xcite extended the capital asset pricing model to incorporate skewness preference .",
    "@xcite developed a new methodology for estimating time - varying conditional skewness .",
    "@xcite showed that conditional skewness explain the cross - sectional variation of expected returns across assets . in @xcite ,",
    "cubic and quartic contracts are defined to measure risk - neutral skewness and kurtosis .",
    "@xcite developed a garch type option pricing model with inverse gaussian innovations to incorporate conditional skewness .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposes a new definition of realized third moment which satisfies the aggregate property to estimate of the true third moment of long - horizon returns .",
    "in addition , kurtosis , the fourth standardized moment , also plays an crucial role in financial studies and it is well known that a financial asset return distribution has larger kurtosis than the gaussian distribution .",
    "@xcite proposed a new model for autoregressive kurtosis and showed the evidence of the presence of autoregressive conditional kurtosis .",
    "@xcite also indicated a significant presence of conditional skewness and kurtosis .",
    "our approaches to examining the high moments of return distribution are based on quadratic variation methods and the motivation stems from the previous researches on the quadratic variation of asset return process .",
    "the quadratic variation of an asset return ( or price ) process , the limit of the sum of squared returns , plays a central role in measuring the variance of return , since the expectation of the quadratic variation of return is considered as an estimator of the variance of the return distribution .",
    "the realized ( quadratic ) variation , which refers to the finite sum of squared return computed from high - frequency return time series , is an approximation to the quadratic variation .",
    "thus , the realized variation of return is an efficient estimator of the variance of return distribution under physical probability .",
    "we extend this idea to link newly defined high moment variations and the corresponding quantities of the return distribution .    in the previous studies about theory and empirical analysis on high - frequency data",
    ", @xcite showed that when underlying process is a semimartingale , the realized variance is a consistent estimator of quadratic variation .",
    "@xcite derived the asymptotic distribution of the realized volatility error under stochastic volatility models . @xcite and @xcite introduced realized bipower variation which is robust to rare jumps in estimating integrated variance and tested jump in asset price process .",
    "@xcite examined the errors of the realized variance under the presence of market microstructure noise .",
    "@xcite studied local - constancy approximation of variance on which econometric literatures of high frequency data often rely .",
    "one of the interesting properties of the quadratic variation of the return is that the risk - neutral expectation of the quadratic variation is synthesized by a continuum of european option prices .",
    "more precisely , the expectation is represented by an integration formula whose integrand is composed of weighted option prices . for detailed information about such replication techniques , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , one can compare the difference between the variance of return under the physical probability and the risk - neutral probability by computing the realized variance and the synthesized option value . using this method , @xcite",
    "show that there exists a variance risk premium which implies that the risk - neutral variance is generally larger than realized variance .",
    "the reader may refer to @xcite where the relationship between the variance risk - premium and the higher degree quantities of the return distribution is explained .",
    "@xcite investigate the role of jump in explaining the variance risk - premium .",
    "see @xcite for the relationship between the realized and risk - neutral volatilities .",
    "the synthesized option value is often referred to as a fixed variance swap rate .",
    "the fixed variance swap rate is the value in which investors are willing to pay to protect their wealth from variance risk . for more information about variance swap ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we show that the risk - neutral expectations of the third and fourth moment variations are composed of synthesized option part of out - of - the - money ( otm ) european options and jump correction parts .",
    "our empirical study shows that the option parts of expected third and fourth moment variation are good approximations to expected third and fourth moments of the return distribution , respectively .",
    "the fact that the realized high moments variations , computable from high - frequency data , are mimicking the moments of return distribution , ones hard to compute from data , is important to hedge fat - tail risk . to hedge the risk",
    ", we propose a new kind of variation swap .",
    "the swap is similar with the skew swap introduced in @xcite and @xcite , but the floating leg is defined to be the realized third moment variation of the asset return over a fixed time period .",
    "the third moment variation swap can be used to hedge shortfall risk of a financial asset with heavy left tail return distribution . under the third moment",
    "variation swap , counterparties exchange the realized third moment variation for a predetermined strike price .",
    "the portfolio consisting of the skewed underlying asset and the third moment swap has more gaussian - like symmetric return distribution than the original asset so that one can hedge extreme shortfall risk .",
    "the fourth moment variation swap can be applied to an asset with leptokurtic return distribution to hedge fat - tail risk .",
    "similarly , the portfolio consisting of the fat - tailed underlying asset and the fourth moment variation swap has more gaussian - like thinner tail return distribution .",
    "we employ simulations and empirical studies to examine the performance of the variation swap .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
