    "an idea of alferov et al . , @xcite , comprising the use of a geometrically - narrow active recombination region where photon generation occurs ( quantum wells ; qw ) , with waveguides around improving the gain to loss ratio ( separate confinement heterostructures ; sch ) , has largely dominated the field of optoelectronics development in the past years .",
    "algaas edge emitting lasers are an example of practical realization of these ideas .",
    "now , they are mostly used for pumping solid state @xmath0 lasers used either in high - power metallurgical processes or , already , in first field experiments as a highly directional source of energy in weapons interceptors .    in our earlier works",
    "we first were able to find agreement between our calculations of quantum well energy states and the lasing wavelength observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "next @xcite , several changes in structure of sch algaas lasers have been shown to considerably improve their electrical and optical parameters . we compared computed properties with these of lasers produced by polyus research institute in moscow @xcite , @xcite .    in particular , by changing the width of active region ( quantum well ) ,",
    "waveguide width , as well by changing the waveguide profile by introducing a gradual change of al concentration , we were able to decrease significantly the lasing threshold current , increase the slope of optical power versus current , and increase optical efficiency @xcite .",
    "we have shown also @xcite that the lasing action may not occur at certain widths or depths of quantum well ( qw ) , and the threshold current as a function of the width may have discontinuities .",
    "the effects are more pronounced at low temperatures .",
    "we argue that these discontinuities occur when the most upper quantum well energy values are very close to either conduction band or valence band energy offsets .",
    "the effects may be observed at certain conditions in temperature dependence of lasing threshold current as well .",
    "the main chalanges with the broader use of algaas based sch lasers are related to improving some of their electro - optical characteristics , in particular their optical efficiency .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the role of doping levels across the laser structure , and , if only possible , to find doping concentrations that would lead to the best opto - electrical parameters , maximizing optical efficiency .",
    "we assume here uniform doping profiles accross laser layers .    for simulations , we use sentaurus tcad from synopsys @xcite , which is an advanced commercial computational environment , a collection of tools for performing modeling of electronic devices .",
    "we model a laser with @xmath1 cavity length and @xmath2 laser width , with doping / al - content as described in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "the table [ table_2 ] describes its experimental parameters .",
    "synopsys s sentaurus tcad , used for modeling , can be run on windows and linux os .",
    "linux , once mastered , offers more ways of an efficient solving of problems by providing a large set of open source tools and ergonomic environment for their use , making it our preferred operating system .",
    "this is an advanced , flexible set of tools used for modeling a broad range of technological and physical processes in the world of microelectronics phenomena . in case of lasers , some calculations in sentaurus",
    "have purely phenomenological nature .",
    "the electrical and optical characteristics depend , primarily , on the following computational parameters that are available for adjusting :    @xmath3 of electrodes , @xmath4 , @xmath3 in physics section , @xmath5 , electrical contact resistance @xmath6 .",
    "there are several parameters for adjustment that are related to microscopic physical properties of materials or structures studied",
    ". however , often their values are either unknown exactly or finding them would require quantum - mechanical modeling of electronic band structure and transport , based on first - principles .",
    "this is however not the aim of our work .    in order to find agreement between the calculated results and these observed experimentaly ( the threshold current @xmath7 and the slope of optical power , @xmath8 , are such most basic laser parameters ) ,",
    "we adjust accordingly values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    the results for @xmath7 and @xmath9 , in this paper ,",
    "are all shown normalized by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , which are the values computed for the reference laser described in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "we neglect here the effect of contact resistance , @xmath6 , by not including buffer and substrate layers and contacts into calculations ( compare with structure described in table [ table_1 ] ) .",
    "we use @xmath12 parameter available in sentaurus and treat it as a physical quantity that is closely related to voltage applied .",
    "another parameter available in sentaurus , @xmath13 , is simply related to @xmath12 by the ohmic formula : @xmath14 .",
    "hence , any results shown here may be easy adjusted after calculations by adding the effect of @xmath6 .",
    "let us estimate the value of @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that this is the sum of electrical resistance of n - substrate , n - buffer , and p - contact layers ( see table [ table_1 ] ) . by using simplified formula for each of these layers , @xmath15 , and electron / hole mobility from database of synopsys , we have the following specific resistivity values for these layers ( indexed as rows in table [ table_1 ] ) : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "taking into account appropriate geometrical dimensions , we obtain : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "hence , @xmath6 is dominated by the resistance of n - substrate layer and it is of the order of @xmath22 . at threshold current of @xmath23 , that small resistance will cause a difference between computed by us lasing offset voltage @xmath24 and that one measured by about @xmath25 only .",
    "in will however have a noticeable contribution to differential resistance @xmath26 .",

    "it is possible to work in a batch mode in sentaurus tcad .",
    "however , we find it more convenient to use perl scripts rather for control of batch processing and changing parameters of calculations .",
    "it is a very flexible programming language , suitable in particular for working on text files ( e.g. manipulation on text data files ) , and it is convenient to be used from terminal window rather , not by using a gui interface , which is a more productive approach towards computation .",
    "tcl is a very powerful but easy to learn dynamic programming language , suitable for a wide range of uses .",
    "sentaurus tcad contains libraries designed to be used together with tcl .",
    "they are run through sentaurus s tdx interface and are used for manipulating ( extracting ) spacial data from binary tdr files .    besides , we use tools / programs like gnuplot , grep , shell commands , etc .",
    "a more detailed description , with examples of scripts , is available on our laboratory web site .      the most accurate way of finding @xmath7 is by extrapolating the linear part of @xmath27 to @xmath28 just after the current larger than @xmath7 .",
    "we used a set of gnuplot and perl scripts for that that could be run semi - automatically on a large collection of data .",
    "one should only take care here that a properly chosen is the data range for fiting , since @xmath27 is a linear function in a certain range of @xmath29 values only .",
    "the choice of that range may affect accuracy of data analysis .",
    "we find however that this is the most accurate effective method to analyse the data from a large collection of datasets .",
    "textbooks exponential @xmath30 dependence is fullfiled well at voltages which are well below the lasing offset voltage @xmath24 .",
    "near the lasing threshold , we observe a strong departure from that dependence , and , in particular , for many data curves a clear kink in @xmath30 is observed at @xmath24 .",
    "we find that a modified exponential dependence describes the data very well : @xmath31    where @xmath7 , @xmath24 , as well @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are certain fiting parameters .",
    "the above function is continuous at @xmath24 , as it obviously should , but it s derivative is usually not .",
    "we used equation ( [ exponential_6_parameters ] ) to find out @xmath7 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , the accuracy of this method was found lower than accuracy of the following two methods described .",
    "figure [ doping21a ] shows a few typical examples of i(u ) dependencies , together with lines computed to fit them by using ( [ exponential_6_parameters ] ) .",
    "let us notice that since ( [ exponential_6_parameters ] ) may have a discontinuous derivative , using it to find out differential resistance at @xmath24 is ambiguous . from equation ( [ exponential_6_parameters ] ) , at @xmath36 , we will have @xmath37 on the side @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the side @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , the differential resistance measured in experiments is , to some extend , determined by the resistance of buffer layers and contacts , and by the way how it has been actually defined for non - linear @xmath41 curves .    in practice , the @xmath30 dependence , above @xmath24 but not far above , may be asummed to be a linear function .",
    "in such a case , we find from data anaylysis , for the third dataset , for instance , in figure [ doping21a ] , @xmath42 , which , together with computed contact resistance @xmath43 gives good qualitative agreement with the differential resistance expected for real laser , as listed in table [ table_2 ] .",
    "another approach to find @xmath24 is by finding position of maximum in derivative of logarithm of @xmath45 versus voltage : @xmath46 .",
    "this is a very accurate method when there is a sufficiently large number of datapoints available near @xmath24 .",
    "however , for that , we would have to perform a lot of computations that are time consuming , in small enough steps in @xmath47 .",
    "hence , this method is not always effective .",
    "we find that a good accuracy of determining @xmath24 is from extrapolating linearly gain versus voltage curve in a near range of voltage values below @xmath24 , to the value of maximal gain , which is constant above @xmath24 .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained that way .",
    "let us use the simplified assumption that @xmath30 is linear above @xmath24 : @xmath48 .",
    "together with linear dependence of lasing light power versus current , @xmath49 , we have the following relation between optical power efficiency , @xmath50 , and current @xmath51 :    @xmath52    equation [ kpd_equation ] gives a resonably accurate qualitative description of @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter determining position and value of maximum , @xmath54 , is governed by factor @xmath55 . in a typical case , with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58",
    ", we have @xmath59 .",
    "we sometime prefer to use another form of equation [ kpd_equation ] , where @xmath60 as a function of voltage is used :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ eta_01 ] shows a few examples of @xmath63 curves computed with equation [ kpd_equation_u ] .",
    "by `` n - n '' waveguide structure we mean a doping structure as described in table [ table_1 ] , where both waveguides and the active region ( qw ) are n - type doped .",
    "we present here selected examples only of data obtained from semi - automatic analyses of thousands of datasets .",
    "figures [ doping10a ] , [ doping10a_1 ] , and [ doping10a_2 ] show the role of doping concentration in active region , for a few values of doping concentrations in emitter regions , on basic characteristics of lasers : threshold current , slope of light power versus current , @xmath64 , and lasing offset voltage , respectively .",
    "the doping concentration in waveguide regions is the same on these three figures ; it is @xmath65 .",
    "we see that none of these quantities , i.e. @xmath7 , @xmath66 , @xmath24 , depends strongly on active region doping .    therefore , it is not unexpected that the optical efficiency , the ratio of optical power @xmath45 to total power supplied to the laser , @xmath67 , as shown in figure [ kpd01 ] , weakly depends on doping concentration in active region as well .",
    "though for the lower doping the higher optical efficiency is obtained .",
    "the effects of doping in waveguide regions are similar to these in the active region , but stronger .",
    "figures [ doping16c ] , [ doping16 ] , [ doping_u02 ] , and [ kpd02 ] illustrate , respectively , dependencies of threshold currend , @xmath66 , lasing offset voltage @xmath24 , and optical efficiency on doping levels in waveguide regions .",
    "we observe , again , that the best characteristics ( lowest @xmath7 and highest @xmath66 values ) are at lowest doping levels in waveguides .",
    "@xmath24 also weekly depends on doping in waveguides .",
    "the most significant role is played by doping in emitters regions , rather . however , as figure [ kpd02 ] shows , optical efficiency changes significantly with doping levels .",
    "one would like here to use equation [ kpd_equation_u ] to describe the data in this figure .",
    "however , it could provide only a very qualitative fiting of the data .",
    "since all the data in this figure indicate on the same or very close values of @xmath24 ( compare also results of figure [ doping_u02 ] ) , we attribute large differences between these curves to significant increase of differential resistance @xmath68 when doping level increases . and",
    "that could be understood as building up of p - n junction outside of quantum well region , with increase of doping .    a characteristic for `` n - n '' structure is parabolic dependence of optical efficiency on doping levels , as shown in figure [ kpd04 ] .",
    "doping levels in emitters regions contribute in the most prominent degree to laser characteristics .",
    "figures [ doping11 ] and [ doping12 ] show typical example dependencies of @xmath7 and @xmath66 on doping in emitters . clearly is observed a minimum in @xmath69 at @xmath70 somewhat lower than @xmath71 , and a maximum in @xmath72 at a value of @xmath70 close to that but not the same .    in figures",
    "[ doping41 ] , [ doping43 ] and [ doping44 ] , we show the presence of such a minimum in @xmath69 for a few more sets of data .",
    "we show that a parabolic dependence ( when doping concentration is drawn on logarythmic axes ) is a good approximation of the data : compare the same results as in figure [ doping43 ] shown however in linear scale in figure [ doping44 ] :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are certain fiting parameters .    the lasing offset voltage @xmath24 ( figures [ doping_u04 ] and [ doping_u03 ] ) is sensitive to emitters doping at low levels , only , below around @xmath71 .",
    "strong dependencies of @xmath7 and @xmath66 on doping manifest itself in a strong dependence of optical efficiency on doping levels , as figure [ kpd00 ] shows .",
    "again , it has a parabolic character ( figure [ kpd00 ] ) , similar to that one found for waveguides ( figure [ kpd04 ] ) .",
    "by `` n - p '' waveguide structure we mean a doping structure that differes from that described in table [ table_1 ] , where both waveguides and the active region ( qw ) are n - type doped . here",
    "we assume that the waveguide on the side of n - emitter is of n - type , the other one is of p - type , and qw doping is of n - type .",
    "the most remarkable difference between n - n and n - p structures is that in case of the last one a large reduction of @xmath7 and a significant increase in @xmath66 and in optical efficiency are found .      .",
    "figures [ np06 ] and [ np06 ] show the role of doping concentration in active region , for a few values of doping concentrations in emitter regions , on basic characteristics of lasers : threshold current and slope of light power versus current , @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "we see that none of these quantities depends strongly on active region doping .",
    "these effects are similar to the onse observed for `` n - n '' type of waveguide structure .      .",
    "the effects of doping in waveguide regions are much stronger for n - p structure than these reported for n - n one .",
    "both , lasing threshold current ( figure [ np02 ] ) and corresponding @xmath66 ( figure [ np02 ] ) show a nice strong linear dependence on waveguides doping . since the first one has a positive slope and the second one negative , there will no maximum as a function of @xmath77 in this case , which is different that for the case of n - n structure .",
    "the lasing offset voltage @xmath24 corresponding to the data displayed in figures [ np02 ] and [ np03 ] does not change with waveguide doping ( within the accuracy of our modeling , and the studied doping range ) , and it is of the value of @xmath78 .    in figure [ np01a ]",
    "we compare optical efficiency for both types of structures .      .",
    "as in case on n - n structures , here also doping levels in emitters regions contribute the most to laser characteristics .",
    "figures [ np31 ] and [ np31 ] show example dependencies of @xmath7 and @xmath66 on doping in emitters .",
    "there are no maxima / minima there like in case of n - n structure , and at concentrations above about @xmath71 the effect of doping becomes small .",
    "the lasing offset voltage @xmath24 ( figure [ np09 ] ) is sensitive to emitters doping at low levels , only , below around @xmath71 .",
    "this is the same as for n - n structure .",
    "optical efficiency does depend weekly on doping at large doping levels , unlike for n - n structures ( figures [ np08 ] and [ kpd29 ] ) .",
    "sch algaas lasers with two kinds of waveguide doping structures have been modeled with synopsys tcad : `` n - n '' type structure where both waveguides have n - type of doping ( with qw doping of n - type as well ) , and `` n - p '' structure where the waveguide on the side of p - emitter has p - type doping .",
    "the `` n - n '' structure is of the type we have experimental data for and it was used as a reference in our calculation calibration .",
    "we observed that the doping level in active region has a small only influence on laser characteristics ( lasing threshold current , slope of light power versus current , lasing offset voltage , optical efficiency ) .",
    "better results are obtained for the lowest possible doping .",
    "more pronounced influence is of doping in waveguide regions . for `` n - n '' type of structure",
    "an optimal doping level is of around @xmath79 , but for `` n - p '' type of structure , it is desirable to have lower level of doping concentration there .",
    "the most significant is the role of doping levels in emitters .",
    "it should be around @xmath71 in case of both types of structures .",
    "however , `` n - p '' type of structure gives significantly better results than `` n - n '' one , with threshold current lowered to about 70% and optical efficiency increased to near 80% .",
