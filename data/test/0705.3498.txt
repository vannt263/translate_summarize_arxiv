    "the theory that has been presented implicitly addresses two conceptual pitfalls that have caused confusion and misinterpretation in a range of previous work .",
    "the first pitfall concerns the variant slip length @xmath32 , defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : b_1 ] , which is only equal to @xmath0 in the limit of a linear flow profile .",
    "this limit is generally not applicable for slip measurements .",
    "the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath32 is greater than 10% for typical slip measurements using afm , sfa or ultrasonic oscillation methods .",
    "we further note that ellis and hayward s definition has been used inconsistently ; both with and without considering a taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "navier s slip length @xmath0 should be used at the present time due to its strong physical basis and to promote consistency across experimental studies .",
    "the second conceptual pitfall relates to those experimental studies of slip at oscillating surfaces which have imposed a restriction on the phase of slip @xcite , especially the assumption that the slip length @xmath0 is real - valued .",
    "it is equivalent to assume that @xmath27 or its reciprocal @xmath62 is real - valued , or more generally , that the damping force is in phase with the surface velocity ( eq .  [ eq : b friction ] ) .",
    "several lines of reasoning lead us to emphasize that @xmath0 must be allowed to have non - zero phase .",
    "we have shown that , because the slip length is defined using the shear rate ( eq .  [ eq : gen slip length ] ) , the @xmath16-dependence of the fluid velocity ( a complex exponential , eq .  [ eq : gen fluid wave ] ) introduces phase to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the usual ( nsbc ) form of solid - fluid friction force is viscous ( eq .  [ eq : gen interface stress ] ) and therefore @xmath63 out of phase with the velocity above an oscillating surface .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha vs b ] shows that the phase of @xmath0 in the limit approaching the nsbc is non - zero and that both magnitude and phase must be determined for either @xmath0 or @xmath36 to be fully described . restricting @xmath0 to real values",
    "is equivalent to restricting @xmath36 to one degree of freedom in eq .",
    "[ eq : gen alpha equals ] .",
    "furthermore , experiments @xcite have indicated that a fluid can be expected to oscillate in phase with , or slightly lag , the surface oscillation .",
    "neither interpretation is consistent with a real value of @xmath0 .",
    "having established that @xmath0 must be considered complex , we address specific arguments made in previous studies in support of a real - valued @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , there has been a direct assumption @xcite that the value of @xmath27 ( or @xmath62 ) should not be phase dependent .",
    "this assumption has been based on rodahl and kasemo s argument @xcite , which links @xmath27 to the ratio of force to velocity for low reynolds number drag on small bodies ( e.g. stokes drag ) , in which case @xmath27 is a real constant .",
    "this argument ignores the fact that important factors in the determination of stokes drag include the contribution of pressure surrounding the particle , the requirement for steady non - oscillatory flow and use of the nsbc .",
    "we note that friction and drag parameters are usually real because they are not used to describe oscillatory flow . in conjunction with this point",
    ", we note that the term coefficient of friction , which has frequently been used to describe @xmath27 in slip studies , is distinct from the usual parameter of that name , which relates the shear force to the normal force in the case of solid - solid sliding friction .",
    "secondly , an argument for phase restriction @xcite has drawn on the correlation between bond strength and bond length , which should determine magnitude and phase of slip respectively .",
    "such an argument does not explain why the phase should take one particular value , or why such a correlation between magnitude and phase should not be experimentally investigated .",
    "non - zero phase is not significant in previous work relating to lower - frequency oscillations in afm or sfa devices @xcite , in which @xmath64100  @xmath5 m for 39  hz oscillations in water , as opposed to @xmath4500  nm for a 1  mhz oscillator .",
    "similarly , periodically patterned microchannels @xcite are adequately described by a real - valued slip length when the ratio of the flow velocity to the pattern wavelength does not exceed @xmath41  khz , corresponding to patterns of extremely short spatial wavelength .",

    "appendix  a , in this paper , gives the same derivation with slip included and appendix  b discusses an assumption that is used .",

    "each immersion was carried out after the oscillator had been left for at least 90 minutes , so that instrumental drift per second was @xmath125 for @xmath88/@xmath89 and @xmath126  s for @xmath78 , as measured over 10 minute intervals .    the standard error of the mean measurement was combined with error ascribed to drift to give the total experimental error in @xmath86 and @xmath77 in each case .",
    "uncertainty is dominated by variation between different immersion events , probably due to the extreme thermal and mechanical sensitivity of the instrument . the lesser contribution due to instrumental drift",
    "is accounted for by assuming that the mean drift correction is a random error .",
    "earlier experiments @xcite have established that uncertainty due to surface tension effects and location of the node is small relative to the standard error in the mean value , because very little damping occurs at or near the node .    in order to calculate @xmath86 from measured voltages ,",
    "the half width of the oscillation was measured directly following each immersion .",
    "equations  [ eq : to q^-1 ] and [ eq : to q^-1c ] were then used to calculate a precise value of @xmath90 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a plot having gradient @xmath90 is typically linear ( @xmath127 for all fits ) and independent of temperature , the immersion level and the presence of surfactant .",
    "the two former variables are held constant during immersions , but the slip case experiments were calibrated separately from the base case in the most recent experiments .",
    "the value of @xmath90 is slightly lower for the slip case , as expected from the first principles analysis @xcite in which @xmath90 is inversely proportional to the oscillator s moment of inertia .",
    "the maximum error in @xmath90 , conservatively estimated as the difference between the slip case and the base case , is not significant in comparison with the experimental error of @xmath36 . @xmath90",
    "changes when the torsional oscillator is mechanically altered , but was constant for each individual shear rate presented in fig  [ fig : alpha_expt ] .    for the nsbc , it is expected that @xmath128/@xmath78 @xcite .",
    "this relation was followed to within 5% for the majority of immersions .",
    "even accounting for the possibility of slip , immersion events with @xmath11410% deviation clearly indicate a significant instability in the oscillation and such data were discarded .",
    "experiments have been performed at shear rate amplitudes @xmath129 between 230 and 6840  s@xmath3 , corresponding to linear displacement amplitudes of 3.2 and 96  nm at the antinode .",
    "the linear amplitude of the oscillation is equal to @xmath130/@xmath20 .",
    "the shear rate at the surface of the rod is calculated as described by robinson et al .",
    "@xcite . for this calculation ,",
    "rod diameters and masses were measured using a micrometer screw gauge and a mettler ae 200 mass balance , respectively . for each strain rate , intrinsic gauge capacitance @xmath131 was measured to better than @xmath132 by finding the gradient of straight line plots ( @xmath133 ) of the fractional change in resonant period as a function of total gauge capacitance @xcite .",
    "the transformer ratio linking the electronic and mechanical parts of the equivalent circuit was calculated using @xmath90 .",
    "the alternative calculation ( from first principles ) incorporates large error relating to the electrode separation angle 2@xmath134 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : to_schematic ] , @xcite ) .",
    "the final uncertainty in shear rate amplitude is @xmath135 .",
    "however , the uncertainty in each value relative to the others depends only on @xmath89 , which is precise to better than @xmath136 .",
    "the results for the five experiments in table  [ tab : results ] are plotted as slip parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_expt ] . figures  [ fig : ex alpha amp ] and [ fig : ex alpha phase ] appear similar because , for all five data points , mean values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 have the same sign .",
    "all data lie within experimental uncertainty of the nsbc .",
    "for the three data points from ref .",
    "@xcite , the consistency of mean values ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) previously led to the conclusion that finite slip had likely been observed . although the newer results are not directly comparable due to differences in surface preparation , the mean values are now scattered around @xmath37 , @xmath38 , suggesting that the nsbc is observed with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the most recent experiments have covered a greater range of strain rates and afforded greater precision due to improved stability of the oscillation and better thermal and mechanical isolation .",
    "the corresponding mean values of @xmath141 are now less than 30  nm , and the upper limits bounded by experimental uncertainty are less than 60  nm . for each data point , the lower error bar of @xmath142 is at zero because the nsbc falls within experimental uncertainty . because of the phase discontinuity at the nsbc ( fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha vs b ] ) , any value of @xmath49 is possible for near - nsbc combinations of the measured variables .    previously , qcm measurements @xcite have obtained values of @xmath0 of similar precision , although in that case finite slip lengths of magnitudes between 10 and 80  nm were observed on bare as well as a range of hydrophobic surfaces . as discussed previously ,",
    "the analysis used to derive these values contains inconsistencies .",
    "when considering other results in the literature , we emphasize that comparisons are drawn from data sets taken from measurements of very different flows ( see discussion ) and that the current data are observed over a well - defined , wide range of shear rates .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that the data is consistent with emerging trends from high - precision afm studies .",
    "namely , slip at a hydrophobic smooth surface occurs on scales @xmath143  nm , if at all ; and surface roughness such as that observed for the slip case in the current work may play a part in suppressing any slip at a hydrophobic surface .",
    "in order to discuss the interpretation of experimental slip measurements , we first clarify the terminology used in the discussion .",
    "lauga et al.s definitions @xcite of indirect measurement , apparent slip and effective slip are used , although we extend the definition of effective slip to include temporal as well as spatial averaging .",
    "true slip is an oft - used term not defined by lauga et al .",
    "we define it here as the case when the mean tangential velocity component of fluid is different from that of a solid surface immediately in contact with it .",
    "experimental methods are predominantly indirect at present .",
    "even the most direct optical methods of slip measurement have been labelled indirect @xcite , in the sense that the velocity of tracers rather than the fluid itself is measured . in the case of the oscillator , the measured damping force is not necessarily consistent with the idealised analysis presented in the theory section . in any surface force measurement ,",
    "the flow profile is inferred rather than explicitly determined . under these conditions ,",
    "slip parameters @xmath0 and @xmath36 only describe the slip dynamics in full when rate - independent , true slip occurs and the fluid is entirely newtonian .",
    "caution is required when analytically linking postulated mechanisms to apparent or effective slip measurements .",
    "for example , it often appears convenient to assume the presence of layering at or near the slip interface @xcite .",
    "typically , layers of unknown thickness and interfacial properties only introduce more modelling parameters .",
    "as discussed previously , introduced viscoelasticity is indistinguishable from slip . in two studies employing @xmath36 @xcite , multiple viscoelastic layers with multiple boundary conditions",
    "were modelled and several parameters were fitted .",
    "the resulting magnitudes of @xmath36 ( ranging from @xmath144 to @xmath145 ) were larger than reasonable for a newtonian fluid .",
    "at present , mechanisms of apparent slip are poorly characterized , so empirical measurement of slip parameters remains the most important step .",
    "newtonian fluids should be considered newtonian right up to the interface to avoid introducing error .",
    "sfa and afm techniques are currently the most well developed and widely - employed methods of measuring surface slip , and can reach resolution of better than @xmath146  nm for @xmath0 @xcite . optical methods such as the fluorescent recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) @xcite and particle image velocimetry ( piv ) @xcite techniques allow resolution of @xmath124100  nm , limited by diffraction and tracer particle size . recently ,",
    "a nano - piv system has reportedly resolved true slip lengths of less than 100  nm with uncertainty less than @xmath12420  nm @xcite .",
    "several groups have measured slip using capillary techniques @xcite , but accuracy has been limited by capillary fabrication issues , the difficulty of controlling surface chemistry within a capillary and ( in some cases ) the effects of electro - osmotic flow . a recently - developed technique derives slip from measurement of thermal motion of confined colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "a slip length of 18  @xmath124  5  nm has been reported at near - zero shear rate .",
    "torsional oscillator experiments presented in the current work confirmed the nsbc to within @xmath147 for @xmath42 , @xmath148 for @xmath43 and to within 60  nm of @xmath2 .",
    "we stress that there are no significant limitations on the precision of the oscillator other than control of atmospheric conditions , vibration and electrical noise .",
    "further , the technique offers advantages and points of difference when compared with other techniques",
    ".    a particular advantage of the torsional oscillator is characterization of experimental shear rate .",
    "the shear rate amplitude is easily varied by adjusting the applied gauge voltage and can at least cover the range @xmath149 to @xmath150  s@xmath3 . a major reason for use of torsional oscillators in rheological experiments is the large and difficult - to - reproduce range of accessible shear rates @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the variable velocity distribution across a qcm causes analytic complications @xcite . in the afm and sfa techniques @xcite ,",
    "the shear rate varies with respect to surface separation and distance from an axis passing through the centres of the approaching curved surfaces .",
    "the shear rate is maximized away from this axis and also depends on the approach or withdrawal rate of the two spheres @xcite .",
    "the second major advantage of the torsional oscillator is versatility .",
    "surface treatments can easily be applied to the specimen rod , either while remote from the oscillator or attached to it",
    ". if the specimen rod is detached , the response of the oscillator is easily recalibrated .",
    "electronic voltage and period measurements are captured near - instantaneously , so time - dependent trends can be measured .",
    "the oscillator is perfectly suited to measurement of in - situ changes of surface chemistry or other parameters , and experimental precision would be significantly enhanced for such experiments .",
    "the oscillator can readily be used at variable temperatures and even variable pressures .",
    "although it is best suited to differential measurements ( similarly to optical techniques ) , the zero - slip response can be determined by careful calibration of all the parameters described in the original equivalent circuit analysis @xcite .",
    "in contrast , use of qcms and other torsional oscillator designs @xcite for slip measurement presents difficulties with regard to surface modification and incorporating piezoelectric equations into an equivalent circuit analysis .",
    "an important distinction between damping - oscillation methods and other techniques is that the shear damping force is measured .",
    "sfa and afm methods measure drainage forces caused by pressure in the flow around curved surfaces ; viscous forces are not significant .",
    "another difference is that , when using the torsional oscillator , slip occurs over a relatively large fluid - solid interface , so measurement of molecular - scale effects is limited by surface homogeneity .",
    "however , measurement of effective slip will give more accuracy and precision than a value derived from a small system .",
    "it is not true that measurements of effective slip must take place on a scale @xmath151 in order to have a measurable impact @xcite , because any fundamental slip mechanism should be consistent over the whole interface .",
    "regardless , we note that the linear displacement amplitude for the torsional oscillator is of comparable magnitude to the slip length , so molecular - scale interactions are certainly probed using this device .",
    "in this paper , we have drawn particular attention to the occurrence of slip at an oscillating interface .",
    "the ultrasonic composite torsional oscillator is a versatile instrument for measurement of viscous damping forces , and therefore slip . in order to fully characterize this device for slip measurements",
    ", we have revisited fundamental aspects of the slip analysis .",
    "the analysis has then been applied at a generalised oscillating surface , followed by the surface of the oscillator s specimen rod in particular .",
    "preliminary experiments at shear rates between 230 and 6800  s@xmath3 have probed slip at a hydrophobic surface of rms roughness 24  nm , obtaining resolution better than @xmath147 for @xmath42 , @xmath148 for @xmath43 and within 60  nm of @xmath2 .",
    "navier s slip parameter , while retaining the units of length , is best suited to interpretation as a surface force effect .",
    "measurement of surface forces has played an important role in developing the understanding of slip to date , while applications are likely to utilise the lubricating effect at a slipping surface .",
    "the actual velocity discontinuity at an oscillating interface , as encapsulated by the parameter @xmath36 for oscillating surfaces , is being directly observed with increasing precision using optical methods .",
    "the link between a velocity discontinuity and a surface force necessarily utilizes the spatial gradient of an analytical flow profile , unless both types of experiment can be performed on the same system .",
    "ongoing experiments will aim to significantly develop the stock of published slip measurements at oscillating surfaces .",
    "particular experimental topics will be the influence of shear rate , hydrophobicity and surface texture , while the development and in - situ characterisation of surfaces or fluids with switchable properties will also be a priority .",
    "thanks are due to dr .",
    "shen chong for assistance with setting up the apparatus described here and used previously @xcite .",
    "in this section , the damping torque on a composite torsional ultrasonic oscillator rod , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : to_schematic ] , is calculated .",
    "we follow robinson and smedley @xcite and incorporate the case in which there is finite slip , as introduced in the theory section . using the cylindrical polar co - ordinate system defined in fig .  [",
