    "the theory matches the experiments in terms of qualitative behavior while the quantitative size of the nonclassical effect does not .",
    "this has led us to consider complications in the experiments which may be responsible for the discrepancy including deviations from the weak field limit , and dephasing due to the atoms entering and leaving the cavity .",
    "the experiments use an atomic beam to introduce atoms into the cavity so that the time of flight across the mode is on the order of ten spontaneous emission lifetimes @xcite .",
    "we expect that dephasing due to atomic traversal of the cavity will have a detrimental effect on nonclassical correlations .",

    "it was assumed that the atoms sit at antinodes of the field where the coupling is a maximum .",
    "here we allow the atoms to be placed anywhere in the mode so that a range of couplings are allowed for different atoms .",

    "the time step is chosen so as to minimize such occurrences .",
    "for this system , the collapse operators are @xmath51 and @xmath52 corresponding to emission of a photon from the cavity field and the atom respectively . in section [ sec : dephasing ] , we describe dephasing due to an atom leaving the cavity using another collapse operator .",
    "because this unraveling of the master equation is based on photon counting experiments , the calculation of the second order correlation function is carried out quite naturally .",
    "the collapse operator @xmath51 corresponds to emission and detection of a photon from the cavity field mode .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 by building up a histogram of delay times between photon detections averaged over a long evolution time in a way analogous to experimental measurement .",
    "the photon statistics of the transmitted light have already been calculated in the weak field limit using a truncated five state basis where the system has up to two quanta of energy in it @xcite .",
    "the three types of nonclassical behavior previously discussed have been seen in subsequent experiments , however these experiments are not strictly in the weak field limit .",
    "it is of interest then to calculate the photon statistics for arbitrary driving field and to see to what extent the nonclassical effects persist .",
    "it is expected that for a strong enough driving field , the atoms saturate and the nonclassical photon correlations will be washed out because the cavity will basically contain a coherent state which is only mildly perturbed by the presence of the atom .",
    "looking at the photon correlations in the weak field limit from the point of view of quantum trajectories , we can interpret the nonclassical effects as resulting from the collapse of the wavefunction .",
    "the detection of the first photon emitted from the steady state collapses the wavefunction of the system ( @xmath53 ) and the subsequent time evolution as the system returns to the steady state determines the photon correlations .",
    "the second order correlation function is given by the probability of detecting a second photon normalized to the probability of detecting a photon in the steady state .",
    "here we start the system in the steady state , collapse the wavefunction , and let it evolve to get @xcite @xmath54 this assumes that there is usually only one photon emitted as the system returns to steady state which is a good approximation in the weak field limit .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] for the case of the overshoot violation .",
    "outside of the weak field limit the photon correlation s are altered for two reasons .",
    "most simply , the time evolution following a collapse from steady state will be altered by the stronger driving field .",
    "another effect , however , is the presence of multiple collapses before the system returns to the steady state . consider a multiple collapse process .",
    "the first photon comes from the steady state and collapses the wavefunction of the system ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "now the time evolution occurs as before .",
    "however , the second photon collapses the system to a new state which depends on the delay time since the emission of the first photon [ @xmath56 .",
    "if a third photon is emitted before the system returns to steady state then its delay time will depend on the details of the evolution from @xmath57 . when averaged over many instances",
    ", this process will wash out the nonclassical effects because of the different evolution following different possible states , @xmath57 .",
    "an example of this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2photon ] where the conditioned photon number undergoes two collapse events .",
    "this figure shows three delay times of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 with different evolutions of the conditioned photon number resulting in each case .",
    "figure [ fig : evolve ] shows the time evolution of @xmath61 following a photon emission from the steady state for a variety of system parameters .",
    "the overshoot persists in the evolution of the field following emission of a photon from the cavity for a driving field as large as @xmath62 .",
    "the undershoot and sub - poissonian statistics survive for driving fields as large as @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the saturation field strength @xmath65 is the driving field for which @xmath66    the photon statistics of the transmitted field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strong ] for the three types of nonclassical effects seen in this system at a variety of driving field intensities .",
    "figure [ fig : strong](a ) shows @xmath3 for system parameters ( @xmath67 ) which produce an overshoot violation of the schwarz inequality [ @xmath68 in the weak field limit . at a driving field of @xmath69 the overshoot violation",
    "is gone , thus this nonclassical effect is quite dependent on the weak driving field .",
    "figure [ fig : strong](b ) shows photon statistics for system parameters ( @xmath70 ) which produce an undershoot violation of the schwarz inequality [ @xmath71 in the weak field limit . here",
    "the nonclassical effect disappears at a driving field of @xmath72 showing that this is a more robust effect .",
    "figure [ fig : strong](c ) shows photon statistics for system parameters ( @xmath73 ) which produce photon antibunching [ @xmath74 and sub - poissonian statistics [ @xmath1 in the weak field limit . in this case the nonclassical effect persists until @xmath75 where the system shows slight bunching and super - poissonian statistics .",
    "( notice that the nonclassical effects are not as robust as the time evolution of the cavity field would indicate .",
    "therefore the destruction of nonclassical effects are in part a result of multiple photon processes . ) for all system parameters the transmitted light becomes super - poissonian as the driving field is increased .",
    "we now turn our attention to the effects of atomic traversal of the cavity on the photon statistics . in previous work",
    "it has been assumed that the atoms are all fixed at antinodes of the cavity field and so had the maximum coupling @xmath76 .",
    "experiments on this system have used atomic beams to send atoms through a cavity .",
    "this atomic traversal of the cavity will introduce two new effects .",
    "first , the atom / cavity field coupling will depend on the position of the atom in the cavity .",
    "one might think that this would destroy the nonclassical correlations .",
    "however , the atoms with the largest coupling interact most strongly with the field and are most likely to contribute to the correlations .",
    "so the atoms near an antinode will have the largest contribution and other atoms may have little effect on the correlations .",
    "this issue will be further addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : two atoms ] .",
    "the second effect of atomic traversal is dephasing which occurs when an atom enters or leaves the cavity .",
    "it is this effect which we consider in this section .",
    "we have used two approaches to model the dephasing due to atomic traversal .",
    "the first is to add a term to the master equation which describes nonradiative decay of atomic polarization .",
    "@xmath77 this term in the master equation has its origins in collisional processes @xcite and so may or may not accurately describe the dephasing which occurs when an atom leaves the cavity .",
    "the second approach uses a quantum trajectory simulation of the system to model the dephasing . in this approach",
    "we assume that there is always exactly one atom in the cavity .",
    "an atom leaves the cavity and another atom enters the cavity in the ground state at a rate @xmath78 .",
    "we can assume the atom enters the cavity in the ground state , but it is not immediately clear how to deal with the state of the exiting atom .",
    "this atom is in some superposition of excited and ground state and these states are entangled with the cavity field state .",
    "one approach would be to leave the photon number distribution of the cavity field unchanged using a collapse operator which has the following action on the state of the system : @xmath79 however , this is not a consistent application of the quantum trajectories .",
    "consider the evolution of the atom after it leaves the cavity .",
    "the atom at some later time may emit a photon into the vacuum meaning it was in the excited state when it left the cavity ; or it will never emit a photon , meaning it was in the ground state when it left the cavity .",
    "in general , the atom and environment and by entanglement the atom / cavity system will then be described by a density operator .",
    "however , we wish to use a pure state to describe the atom / cavity system conditioned on the detection of transmitted photons . to be consistent",
    "we must use a pure state to describe the atom after it has left the cavity .",
    "we use a collapse operator which picks either the excited state field distribution or the ground state field distribution of the system and then places the new atom in the ground state .",
    "this operator has the following action :    @xmath80    this collapse operator is then applied at a gaussian distributed series of times with average @xmath81 and a full width of @xmath81 as this approximates the traversal times of atoms with a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution .",
    "this model of dephasing differs from collisional dephasing in two important ways .",
    "first , it does not enter the deterministic hamiltonian evolution between collapses at all , whereas the collisional dephasing in the trajectory picture would have both a collapse component as well as the decay of coherence in the continuous evolution .",
    "second , this dephasing always places the atom into the ground state whereas the collisional dephasing places the atom in the ground or excited state with probabilities determined by the relative populations .",
    "now we turn to our results and a comparison of the two types of dephasing .",
    "because the traversal dephasing does not affect the deterministic evolution of the system we expect that for a given dephasing rate it will be less destructive of the nonclassical photon statistics than collisional dephasing . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing ] we show the second order correlation function with collisional dephasing .",
    "all three types of nonclassical effects are quite sensitive to this dephasing with @xmath82 destroying the overshoot [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing](a ) ] and undershoot [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing](b ) ] while the sub - poissonian statistics survive until @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing](c ) .",
    "our results for the transit dephasing are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing2 ] .",
    "the overshoot in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing2](a ) is again extremely sensitive to dephasing with classical statistics for @xmath84 while the sub - poissonian statistics in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing2](b ) are more robust , surviving up to @xmath85 .",
    "we now consider the effect of placing two atoms inside the cavity either both at antinodes of the field , or allowing one of the atoms to be arbitrarily placed so that its coupling is in the range @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "dephasing is not considered in this section . in the experiments conducted on this system",
    "it is likely that there is some effect from spectator atoms which are located away from an antinode of the field and so do not contribute to the nonclassical photon statistics .",
    "if there are enough of these atoms they may simply absorb light and emit it out of the cavity thus effectively decreasing the quality of the cavity . as a first step towards understanding the effect of spectator atoms , we place one extra atom in the cavity with a coupling which is some fraction of the original atom s coupling .",
    "we use a quantum trajectory simulation to calculate photon statistics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectator ] we plot @xmath3 while allowing the coupling of the spectator atom ( @xmath88 ) to vary from @xmath89 to @xmath87 .",
    "we see that for all three sets of parameters the photon statistics vary continuously from the single atom result to the two atom result with no qualitative deviation in the photon statistics .",
    "this suggests that the spectator atoms can have an observable effect on the statistics , but they do not destroy the nonclassical correlations at least when close to the ideal condition of having a single atom in the cavity at a time",
    ". a group of many spectator atoms may be more detrimental to nonclassical correlations .",
    "we now consider the case in which both atoms are placed at antinodes of the field .",
    "the photon statistics for this system have been solved for an arbitrary number of maximally coupled atoms using a set of symmetrized dicke states to describe the atomic excitation @xcite .",
    "this would correspond to an experimental setup where it is not possible to tell which atom spontaneously emitted a given photon .",
    "however , there would be experimental situations where the symmetrized states are not valid states with respect to spontaneous emission . here , using quantum trajectories , we consider both a symmetrized collapse and an unsymmetrized collapse for spontaneous emission .",
    "the operator for the dicke collapse is @xmath90 so that when a spontaneous emission event occurs , both atoms are collapsed symmetrically . for the non - dicke collapse",
    "the atomic operators are used separately so that one atom or the other collapses .    for weak driving field",
    "we expect that there will be no difference between these types of collapse because in this limit we only detect photons emitted from steady state .",
    "however , for stronger driving fields we begin to detect photons emitted from the collapsed state and the two collapses give a different collapsed state ( @xmath91 or @xmath92 versus @xmath93 ) , and therefore , different photon statistics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dicke ] @xmath3 is plotted for the two types of collapse for a driving field of @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ fig : dicke](a ) shows a significant difference as the nonclassical statistics are completely gone for the non - symmetrized collapse .",
    "figure [ fig : dicke](b ) shows no dependence on the type of collapse .",
    "figure [ fig : dicke](c ) shows a mild dependence on the type of collapse with a slightly larger value of @xmath95 for the non - symmetrized collapse .",
    "we have investigated extensions to previous theoretical work on a driven atoms / cavity system with dissipation .",
    "we have calculated the normalized second order correlation function for the transmitted light including effects of arbitrary driving fields , non - radiative dephasing , and arbitrary coupling strength for multiple atoms .",
    "we have found that nonclassical field states are easily destroyed by deviations from the weak field limit and by non - radiative dephasing modeled as both collisional dephasing and as atomic transit dephasing .",
    "we have also found that allowing two atoms in the cavity with different atom / field coupling strengths does not have a detrimental effect on the nonclassical field .",
    "the experiments which have been done on this system have not really in the weak field limit .",
    "as @xmath96 the number of counts also goes to zero so it is difficult to carry out experiments in this regime , but this work suggests that it is important .",
