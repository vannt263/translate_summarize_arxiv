    "one can see that there are additional two - fold rotation axes , @xmath46 , passing through centers of opposite slanted bonds .",

    "3 are the side view of both tubes with corresponding symmetry elements .    to summarize : there are symmetry elements , @xmath41 , @xmath40 , @xmath67 , @xmath46 , as well as two types of fixed points , @xmath15 ( inversion ) and @xmath68 , which are common to cnts with both even and odd @xmath5 .",
    "symmetry elements @xmath44",
    ", @xmath45 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are inherent to cnts with even @xmath5 , while elements @xmath44 and @xmath62 are characteristic to odd @xmath5 .",
    "this analysis also demonstrates that all symmetry elements of both @xmath59 and @xmath58 groups are permitted in cnts ( see table  iii and fig .",
    "one can say that cnts ` combine ' symmetry properties of @xmath58 and @xmath59 point groups .",
    "in particular , cnt has three classes of two - fold axes for even @xmath5 : ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "these axes are the combination of two classes for @xmath58 symmetry group ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 axes ) and one class of @xmath42 axes for @xmath59 ( @xmath46 axes ) .    in the case of zigzag",
    "cnts an analysis is similar .",
    "thus , with a knowledge of cnts symmetry elements and the calculated vibrational spectra we can identify raman - active modes in cnts .",
    "in this section we recall main rules for determining raman - active modes .",
    "let the transition between states @xmath69 and @xmath70 is associated with wave functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "then the probability for the @xmath73 process is proportional to the square of the transition moment @xmath74 , where    @xmath75    in raman process , @xmath19 is the dipole moment induced by the external field @xmath76 .",
    "the induced dipole moment is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a polarization tensor .",
    "thus , the selection rules in raman spectra are determined by the values of integrals    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is a component ( or a linear combination of components ) of the polarization tensor ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the transition @xmath82 is allowed if ( [ probability ] ) is nonzero for at least one component @xmath83 .",
    "the integration is performed over the full set of electronic and nuclear coordinates . direct calculation of ( [ probability ] ) is very complicated problem .",
    "so , the usual practice is to consider the electronic , vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom separately .",
    "thus the wave function can be written as the product @xmath84 . as a result",
    "only the following integrals should be estimated for raman transitions :    @xmath85    vibrational wave function @xmath86 is real and is represented by an eigenvector of the dynamical matrix . since we consider the @xmath2-point of brillouin zone , where the dependence on the @xmath48 coordinate is absent , the space integration in ( [ probability_v ] ) is replaced by the area integral    @xmath87    it is convenient to return back to the polar coordinates @xmath88 . in the simplest case",
    "the ground - state vibrational mode @xmath89 is fully symmetric and is a constant in polar coordinates .",
    "moreover , the vibrational wave function is the discrete function ( eigenvector of the dynamical matrix )",
    ". then ( [ probability_s ] ) transforms to the sum :    @xmath90    where the summation is over atoms @xmath91 of only one layer , and products of polarization tensor components with @xmath92-th elements @xmath93 of eigenvector of @xmath16-th normal mode are calculated for angles @xmath94 , corresponding to polar coordinate of atom @xmath92 .",
    "this approach is very convenient as both polarization tensor components and eigenvector elements of vibrational modes have very simple representation in polar coordinates for cnts .",
    "as is demonstrated in appendix , only @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 components of polarization tensor differ from zero for cnts and are shown in fig .  4 .",
    "many one - dimensional modes in ( [ list ] ) can be excluded from candidates for raman vibrations .",
    "( i ) all modes with subscript ` u ' are eliminated as all components of polarization tensor are symmetric with respect to this operation ; ( ii ) all @xmath33 modes are excluded as antisymmetric with respect to @xmath40 operation .",
    "( iii ) @xmath49 modes are also non - raman - active as they are asymmetric with respect to @xmath42 operations .",
    "hence , only two fully symmetrical @xmath99 modes are raman - active .",
    "doubly - degenerated @xmath100 modes in polar coordinates behave as @xmath101 , where @xmath102  some phase .",
    "their schematic view is given in fig .",
    "the signs assignment is arbitrary .",
    "for instance , the clockwise direction for tangential displacements and radial displacements out of center have ` + ' sign .",
    "comparison of fig .  4 and fig .  5 results in the fact that only @xmath4 mode can be raman - active .",
    "really , the shapes of components of polarization tensor coincide only with the shape of @xmath4 mode , and signs of their lobes alternate in the same manner . actually , it is necessary to estimate expression ( [ probability_s ] ) , which can be reduced to    @xmath103    and is different from zero only if @xmath104 .",
    "( @xmath105 ) is the general representation for @xmath98 and @xmath106 components of polarization tensor , and phases @xmath102  for vibrational modes and @xmath107  for polarization tensor are related as their principal axes coincide . ) .",
    "it means that only @xmath4 modes can be raman - active .",
    "the conclusion that only @xmath99 and @xmath4 modes are raman - active is valid for all types of achiral cnts , both armchair and zigzag with arbitrary @xmath5 ( see table  ii ) .",
    "two @xmath99 modes for all types of cnts are raman - active as they are fully symmetrical `` breathing '' and tangential modes ( see fig .  6 ) .",
    "now we will demonstrate that one of @xmath4 modes is not raman - active on the example of @xmath8 cnt .",
    "all @xmath4 modes are shown in fig .",
    "one can see the difference between mode ( c ) and three other modes , this deference being in ` signs ' of relative displacements of neighboring atoms .",
    "these displacements are predominantly `` in - phase '' for ( a ) , ( b ) and ( d ) modes and are `` out - of - phase '' for ( c ) mode . hence , these `` phase '' relations of different modes give different contributions to ( [ probability_sum ] ) : this sum is not equal to zero for modes ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and is zero ( or very close to zero ) for mode ( c ) .",
    "it means that mode ( c ) is not raman - active , and raman spectra of @xmath8 cnt have 5 raman - active vibrations ( see table  ii ) .",
    "these conclusion is valid for all @xmath0 cnts with even @xmath5 .",
    "situation with @xmath4 vibrations for @xmath0 cnts with odd @xmath5 is analogous . among six @xmath4 modes",
    "there are two `` out - of - phase '' modes which are not raman - active , and total number of raman - active vibrations in this type of cnts is 6 .",
    "there are no `` out - of - phase '' modes in @xmath1 cnts , and the total number of raman - active vibrations is the sum of @xmath99 and @xmath4 mode types : 5 raman - active modes for @xmath1 cnts if @xmath5 is odd , and 8 raman - active modes if @xmath5 is even .",
    "the reason why armchair cnts differ from zigzag cnts consists in the fact that the latter have one atom in the primitive cell , and the former  two atoms .",
    "two atoms in the primitive cell for armchair cnts allow intrinsic vibrational `` fine '' structure .",
    "qualitatively it can be demonstrated as follows .",
    "we consider @xmath100 modes , and the armchair ring is chosen as the unit cell .",
    "this unit cell consists of @xmath108 atoms from two layers ( see fig .  8a , where @xmath109 cnt is shown , as an example ) .",
    "let us open this fragment into a planar structure ( fig .",
    "8b ) and further project into a linear chain ( fig .",
    "there are two atoms in the primitive cell ( two adjacent atoms in a layer ) since @xmath40 axis was chosen as a principal axis .",
    "so every filled circle in fig .",
    "8c represents one primitive cell of two atoms .",
    "this gives a chain with cyclic boundary conditions consisting of @xmath110 units , and its solution is convenient to write in the form :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is a deviation of the unit @xmath113 for @xmath38-th type of normal vibration ( @xmath114 ) , and @xmath113 numerates the units in the chain ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "so , the full vibrational spectrum of @xmath0 cnt in the center of the brillouin zone can be approximated by a solution of the one - dimensional chain with cyclic boundary conditions and some effective potential .",
    "the solution ( [ linear_chain ] ) gives all one- and two - dimensional modes .",
    "really , if @xmath116 then all units have equal deviations @xmath117 of the same sign , which corresponds to @xmath32 modes .",
    "if @xmath118 then all units have equal absolute values of deviations , but the signs of relative deviations alternate @xmath119 , which corresponds to @xmath33 modes .",
    "modes @xmath100 are formed by pairs of solutions ( [ linear_chain ] ) with ` conjugated ' values of @xmath38 : @xmath38 and @xmath120",
    ". really ,    @xmath121 ,    and it gives @xmath122 @xmath100 modes for @xmath0 cnts in agreement with ( [ list ] ) .    the solution ( [ linear_chain ] ) for @xmath104",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "8c and corresponds to @xmath4 mode of the nanotube .",
    "this mode can be represented schematically in polar coordinates as shown in fig .",
    "8d and is equivalent to mode @xmath4 in fig .  5 .",
    "the main goal of the present communication is the calculation of numbers of raman - active modes in achiral cnts @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath5 = 912 ) .",
    "vibrational modes are calculated in @xmath2-point of brillouin zone , and raman - active modes are identified by an estimation of matrix elements responsible for the intensity of corresponding transitions , and no preliminary full group - theoretical analysis of cnts is necessary in this case . for achiral cnts only three diagonal and @xmath123 components of polarization tensor",
    "are not equal to zero .",
    "we have shown that there are one or two @xmath4 modes for @xmath0 cnts which are not raman - active .",
    "it follows from the fact that the primitive cell of these cnts has two atoms , and vibrational modes have `` in - phase '' and `` out - of - phase '' types of vibrations , the latter being non - raman - active .",
    "the primitive cell of @xmath1 cnts consists of one atom and these cnts has no analogous complications .",
    "the calculated numbers of raman - active modes are five or six for @xmath0 cnts for even and odd @xmath5 , correspondingly . for @xmath1 cnts there are five raman - active modes for even @xmath5 and eight raman - active modes for odd @xmath5 .",
    "our primary goal was to formulate the selection rules for raman - active modes and less attention was paid to calculations of mode frequencies .",
