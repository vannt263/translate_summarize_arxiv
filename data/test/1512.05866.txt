    "recent observation data show that @xmath6inflation model for the early universe is in remarkable agreement with the observations .",

    "theories of gravity , see for instance @xcite . ]",
    "it is also possible to find a formulation of @xmath0 gravity whose solutions of equations of motion capture both the inflation and late time behaviour of the universe .",
    "it is important to stress that all these cosmological solutions depend only on the time , so that they break the manifest four - dimensional diffeomorphism of general relativity .",
    "then one can ask the question whether the time asymmetry of friedmann - robetson - walker universe could be also reproduced by some theory of gravity with restricted symmetry group .",
    "indeed , the celebrated hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity @xcite which is an interesting proposal for a renormalizable theory of gravity is based on the idea of the restricted invariance of the theory when the theory is invariant under the so - called foliation preserving diffeomorphism .",
    "it turns out that there are two versions of hl gravity , the projectable theory when the lapse depends only on the time and the non - projectable theory with the lapse depending on the spatial coordinates too @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently shown in @xcite that the first versions of non - projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity possesses a pathological behaviour since the hamiltonian constraint is a second - class constraint with itself , which implies that the phase space is odd - dimensional ( for further discussions , see @xcite ) .",
    "the resolution of this problem was first suggested in @xcite and further elaborated in @xcite , where it was argued that in a theory with broken full diffeomorphism invariance , it is natural to include all the terms which contain the spatial gradients of lapse and which are invariant under spatial diffeomorphism too .",
    "then the hamiltonian analysis of this theory shows that this hamiltonian constraint is a second - class constraint with the primary constraint @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the momentum conjugate to the lapse @xmath9 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the number of constraints is less than in general relativity implies the existence of an extra scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "these considerations suggest that the full diffeomorphism invariance must not be the fundamental symmetry of gravity . in that case",
    "it is natural to consider the possibility whether the @xmath0 theory of gravity , which is not invariant under the full four - dimensional diffeomorphism , can be consistent with the recent cosmological models .",
    "there are certainly several ways how to break full diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the most natural way is to generalize hl gravity to its @xmath10like form as was done in several papers ; see for example @xcite . recently a new interesting proposal for a theory with the broken full diffeomorphism invariance",
    "was proposed in @xcite , which is based on the following simple modification was firstly discussed in @xcite when the synthesis of @xmath0 gravity and hl was proposed . ]",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is a parameter and @xmath13 is a four - divergence term that appears in the decomposition of the ricci scalar in four dimensions as @xcite @xmath14 parameter @xmath12 has now meaning as the deformation parameter that in similar context was introduced in case of @xmath0 hl gravity in @xcite while its more physical interpretation will be given in section [ fifth ] and in [ sixth ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the last term is a four - divergence and hence for the einstein - hilbert action the modification ( [ prop ] ) does not make sense , since it gives the boundary contribution that does not affect the equations of motion . on the other hand",
    ", it could have non - trivial consequences in the case of @xmath0 theories of gravity as was shown in @xcite .    due to the interesting features of this simple idea ( [ prop ] )",
    ", we believe it deserves to be studied further . in particular we would like to give a more physical justification for it and see whether the presumptions which were implicitly used in @xcite have solid physical grounds .",
    "in particular , it is not quite clear whether the newtonian gauge used there could be implemented in the theory with the broken diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "motivated by these facts , we perform the hamiltonian analysis of the restricted @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we show , in agreement with @xcite , that the full diffeomorphism invariance is broken . on the other hand , we show that the naive form of restricted @xmath0 gravity possesses the same pathological behaviour as the first versions of non - projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity , whose description was given above .",
    "we resolve this problem in a similar way as in the case of non - projectable hl gravity .",
    "more precisely , we show under which conditions the restricted @xmath0 theory could be considered as a consistent theory from the hamiltonian point of view . in the first case",
    "we impose an additional constraint on the theory .",
    "however , a careful hamiltonian analysis of this version will show that now the theory becomes invariant under the full four - dimensional diffeomorphism and that it reduces to the standard einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant .",
    "the second possibility is to consider an extended version of restricted @xmath0 gravity when we include the terms containing spatial gradients of the lapse .",
    "however , in this case we obtain that this theory could be considered as a low - energy limit of the non - projectable hl theory or gravity .",
    "we perform the hamiltonian analysis of this theory , following @xcite and we show that there is an extra scalar degree of freedom , whose consequences on the physical spectrum around frw background should be taken into account .    having constructed a consistent modification of @xmath0 theory of gravity",
    ", we proceed to the analysis of its cosmological solutions and we find that the properties of these solutions depend on the value of the parameter @xmath12 that allow us to obtain new solutions which do not exist in the ordinary @xmath0 theory of gravity .",

    "we introduce the original formulation of restricted @xmath0 theory of gravity and perform its hamiltonian analysis . in section [ third ]",
    "we study a version of this theory with an additional constraint imposed and we show that this theory is equivalent to the ordinary einstein - hilbert one .",
    "then in section [ fourth ] we propose an extended form of restricted @xmath0 theory of gravity with the spatial gradients of lapse included . in section [ fifth ]",
    "we study some cosmological solutions of such a theory .",
    "finally , in section [ sixth ] , discussion , we outline our results and suggest a possible extension of the work .",
    "let us consider the @xmath15-dimensional manifold @xmath16 with the coordinates @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",

    "so , let @xmath25 denote the metric on @xmath22 with its inverse @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 .",
    "we further introduce the operator @xmath28 , which is the covariant derivative defined by the metric @xmath29 .",

    ", one can perform all the calculations without their smeared forms , but then more care has to be taken .",
    "then it is easy to show that @xmath77 are the generators of the spatial diffeomorphism and that they are the first - class constraints .",
    "we rather focus on the analysis of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce as well the smeared form of the hamiltonian constraint @xmath78 our goal is to perform the calculation of the poisson bracket between the smeared forms of the hamiltonian constraints @xmath79 .",
    "then after some careful calculations we find @xmath80 the expression on the first line is the standard form of the poisson bracket between smeared forms of hamiltonian constraint for the full diffeomorphism invariant theory . on the other , the additional terms in ( [ pbham ] ) which are proportional to @xmath81",
    "do not vanish on the constraint surface and explicitly show the breaking of the full diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "moreover , this result suggests that we have a theory where @xmath82 is a second - class constraint , which is the situation that is known from the analysis of the first versions of non - projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite . as was argued there",
    ", the existence of _ one _ second - class constraint implies that the dimension of the physical phase space is odd , what should not be .",
    "it turns out that there are two possibilities how to resolve this puzzle . the first one is based on the observation that the right side of the poisson bracket ( [ pbham ] ) vanishes on the constraint surface when @xmath83 .",

    "so , eventually @xmath239 will be dominated and the mechanism for the power - law acceleration can occur .",
    "let us now focus our attention on the special case @xmath158 .",
    "this special case was previously studied in @xcite in a different from ours approach . to begin with , we note that eq",
    ". is valid for any @xmath12 . on the other hand , for @xmath158",
    "this equation reduces to an algebraic equation for the hubble parameter .",
    "so , if the equation has a solution we find that it is the de sitter solution which is suitable for the late - time cosmology .",
    "+ for instance , consider for @xmath208 and @xmath158 .",
    "then equation with the matter density on the right - hand side yields @xmath240 this equation is similar to eq . , but note that the equation ( [ op1 ] ) is valid during all the cosmological eras . solving this equation for @xmath241 , we find @xmath242 so , at the late - time we have @xmath243",
    "let us outline the main results of the paper .",
    "we have analyzed the recently proposed version of @xmath0 gravity with broken four - dimensional diffeomorphism by changing the constant in front of the total divergence term that arises in the ( @xmath1)-decomposition of scalar curvature .",
    "we have shown that this naive modification of theory is not consistent from the hamiltonian point of view due to the fact that the hamiltonian constraint is a second - class constraint with itself .",
    "we have proposed two ways how to resolve this issue . the first one is based on the observation that the poisson bracket between the hamiltonian constraint vanishes when we impose an additional constraint on the scalar field @xmath53 . however",
    ", a careful hamiltonian analysis shows that the restricted @xmath0 gravity with this additional constraint is equivalent to the ordinary einstein - hilbert action .",
    "further , we have argued that the right way how to correctly define the restricted @xmath0 theory of gravity is to include the terms which are invariant under the spatial diffeomorphism , for example , the gradient of the lapse .",
    "we have performed the hamiltonian analysis of this theory and we have found that it is consistent one from the hamiltonian point of view and have shown that this theory is equivalent to the low - energy limit of non - projectable @xmath0 hl gravity .",
    "moreover , we have identified two global first - class constraints , which ensure that the hamiltonian is invariant under the global time reparametrization and global rescaling of lapse .",
    "finally , we have discussed some cosmological application of the restricted @xmath0 gravity and have found several interesting implications . in particular , we have discussed the differences between the usual @xmath244 gravity , with @xmath245 and its corresponding restricted version . in addition , it has been shown how the asymptotic solutions of @xmath244 gravity can be changed by the broken symmetry . moreover , we have found that it is possible to find the de sitter solution in the case of @xmath246 gravity , which does not exist in the case of @xmath175 . it has been also found that with a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath12 , this solution describes the inflation phase of cosmology with the correct number of e - foldings .",
    "these results imply nice physical meaning of the parameter @xmath12 : for the early universe @xmath12 determines the scale of inflation and the stability of de sitter solution ( see eq.([cos12 ] ) ) , while for the late - time cosmology , @xmath12 determines the parameter in the equation of state , which can be measured ( see eq.([cos17 ] ) and discussion after it ) .",
    "the results presented are encouraging and the cosmological applications in the context of restricted @xmath0 gravity certainly desrve to be studied further and in more details .",
    "specifically , one should analyze the fluctuations around the cosmological solutions in this theory .",
    "we expect that there is an additional scalar mode and its behaviour should be analyzed",
    ". it would also be interesting to analyze this mode around the flat background following the corresponding analysis in the case of the healthy extension of non - projectable hl gravity @xcite .",
    "we hope to return to this problem in future .",
