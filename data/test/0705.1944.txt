    "the problem of a single hole in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model interacting also with the lattice degrees of freedom has recently attracted a notable interest in connection with the physical properties of the high-@xmath4 cuprates .",
    "@xcite in particular , in parent and strongly underdoped compounds , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) reveals a low energy peak whose dispersion is well described by the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , while its anomalously large broadness has been ascribed to incoherent multi - phonon shake - off processes.@xcite a similar interplay between electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions should in principle be reflected in the optical conductivity spectra . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the most remarkable features observed in the underdoped region are an ubiquitous mid - infrared ( mir ) peak at @xmath5 ev , and a weaker peak around @xmath6 ev , the latter being more strongly doping and temperature dependent.@xcite several interpretations have been proposed for the origin of these features , including midgap or impurity states , @xcite charge / spin stripes,@xcite polaronic excitations,@xcite and the interaction with the antiferromagnetic background.@xcite    the first proposal of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model as a suitable basis to discuss the optical spectra of the cuprates was advanced by zhang and rice @xcite who observed that the @xmath7 behavior@xcite of the optical absorption above @xmath5 ev could be naturally associated to the incoherent motion in an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "successively , the optical conductivity of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model has been investigated in detail using several techniques , such as exact - diagonalization,@xcite analytical approximations@xcite and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite however , and in spite of the above discussed relevance of the electron - phonon coupling , the optical conductivity of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model _ in the presence _ of the lattice degrees of freedom has not been thoroughly investigated .",
    "numerical calculations based on exact - diagonalization of finite clusters were employed for instance in ref . to evaluate @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , the optical conductivity was calculated analytically in ref .",
    "based on a non - crossing born approximation , which is however unable to describe the polaron formation .    in this paper",
    "we present results for the optical conductivity of a single hole in the holstein-@xmath1-@xmath2 model obtained in the framework of dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "one - hole spectral properties at zero temperature were discussed in a previous publication where antiferromagnetic correlations were shown to enhance the effects of the electron - phonon coupling.@xcite a similar result was found also in the antiferromagnetic phase of the holstein - hubbard model using dmft techniques.@xcite a serious drawback of dmft , which is obtained as the exact solution of the lattice problem in the limit of infinite dimensions , is that the magnetic background is treated in a classical way .",
    "this , together with the fact that trugman loops are negligible in infinite dimensions , prevents the possibility to account for coherent hole - propagation , which is related to the spin - flip fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", no drude peak can be observed in the optical conductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the incoherent contributions of @xmath0 are mainly dominated by _",
    "properties , such as the local electron - phonon scattering and spin - string excitations within the magnetic polaron , which are well captured by this approach.@xcite    bearing the above limitations in mind , the aim of the present work is thus to focus on the incoherent part of the optical conductivity of a single - hole and to investigate in detail its features in the different physical regimes of the holstein-@xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "the dependence of the optical spectra on the microscopic parameters is analyzed with special attention to the intermediate coupling region , where the interplay between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom is strongest .",
    "we show that a crucial role is played by the formation of the lattice polaron , which drives a transfer of spectral weight towards higher frequencies , opening a pseudogap at low frequencies .",
    "conversely , starting from the polaronic phase , two different mechanisms can be clearly identified as being responsible for the disappearance of the pseudogap : @xmath8 ) reducing the effective exchange energy scale suppresses the positive feedback of magnetism on polaron formation and can lead to a _ closing _ of the pseudogap as the system crosses back to the non - polaronic regime ; @xmath9 ) increasing the temperature , which does not alter the lattice / magnetic interplay , leads to a _ filling _ of the pseudogap more similar to what is expected in purely polaronic models . in the immediate vicinity of the polaron crossover ,",
    "the spectra are characterized by a coexistence of a magnon peak at low frequency and a broad polaronic band at higher frequency , which closely resembles the experimental situation observed in the cuprates .    on theoretical grounds ,",
    "the definition of the optical conductivity of a single hole is a delicate matter which needs particular care .",
    "we provide an analytical derivation which generalizes the results of refs . to the holstein-@xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "this approach permits us to identify the role of the different one - particle properties on the optical conductivity .",

    "the density of spin defects can be obtained from the magnetization @xmath15 via the curie - weiss equation : @xmath16 which defines a nel temperature @xmath17 .",
    "concerning the electron - lattice interaction , we shall mainly focus on the adiabatic regime @xmath18 which is relevant to the experimental systems of interest . in this regime ,",

    "the one - particle green s function must be generalized to finite temperature , which involves the following steps : @xmath8 ) one has to allow for thermally excited phonons ; @xmath9 ) the presence of thermally excited spin defects requires the introduction of a `` spin - resolved '' green s function , to distinguish hole excitations created on sites with / without spin defects ; @xmath21 ) finally , the reduced magnetization introduces an effective exchange coupling @xmath22 .",

    "we can write : @xmath33 where    @xmath34    carrier motion and exchange interactions are taken into account by the bath propagator @xmath35 where the `` hopping '' self - energy is defined as @xmath36 .",

    "note also that the green s function @xmath42 appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ bathg],[sigma_t ] ) is a phonon averaged quantity , so that the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ g - gnn])-([gtot ] ) involves the simultaneous self - consistency of all of the @xmath43 , which is much more computationally expensive than the solution at zero temperature .",
    "it is easy to check that in the absence of electron - phonon interaction eq .",
    "( [ gtot ] ) recovers the thermal green s function for the pure @xmath1-@xmath2 model as defined in eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) by stumpf and logan.@xcite on the other hand , it should be stressed that the present solution , although it formally recovers the results for the pure holstein model in the limit @xmath44 ( paramagnetic case ) [ eqs .",
    "( 40)-(42 ) of ref .",
    "] , is still described by a purely local green s function @xmath45 due to the assumption of a classical ( although disordered ) spin background .",
    "the main drawback of this assumption is thus that no coherent dispersive peak is obtained in this framework even in the @xmath46 limit of the @xmath1-@xmath2 holstein model , and , consequently , no drude peak appears in the optical conductivity .",
    "notwithstanding this limitation the present approach , as we will show below , is still quite able to reproduce in more than qualitative agreement the incoherent features of both the one - particle green s function and of the optical conductivity .",
    "before discussing the optical conductivity , let us briefly present our results for the one - particle spectral function in the holstein-@xmath1-@xmath2 model at finite temperature .",
    "previous approaches have focused separately on thermal effects either in the pure holstein or in the pure @xmath1-@xmath2 model . the temperature evolution of the hole spectral function @xmath47 for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in the infinite dimensional limit has been analyzed in ref . .",
    "at @xmath20 , it consists of a series of @xmath48-function magnon peaks whose distribution reflects the strength of the magnetic polaron : for sufficiently large @xmath49 the profile is rapidly decaying with energy ( reminiscent of the string picture of small magnetic polarons ) whereas for small @xmath49 it acquires a more symmetric shape , reducing to a semi - circular function in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "the effect of a non - zero temperature within this context is to broaden each @xmath48-function with a bandwidth @xmath51 which is ruled by the thermal spin defect probability @xmath39 .",
    "we shall term this effect the _ intrinsic magnetic broadening_. such intrinsic magnetic broadening @xmath51 is however exponentially small for @xmath52 , and it becomes significant only close to @xmath53 .",
    "a semi - circular shape is recovered also in the paramagnetic phase @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "as the electron - lattice coupling is turned on , each magnon peak splits into several sub - peaks spaced by @xmath56 , reflecting the dressing of the hole by phononic excitations . in this context",
    "the strength of the electron - phonon coupling rules not only the number of phonon satellites but also its spectral weight profile .",
    "just as in the pure holstein model , while the number of phonon peaks is quite small in the weak coupling regime , in the polaronic state a large number of phonon satellites appear with a characteristic gaussian profile .",
    "the envelope of the phononic fine structure has a spread which is governed by the energy associated with the lattice fluctuations : it is given by @xmath57 in the quantum limit , and increases @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "we show the temperature evolution of a typical polaronic spectral function , at @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . throughout the paper ,",
    "when not specified , we shall take the hopping matrix element @xmath1 as the energy unit .",
    "the temperatures considered here are @xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath64 . at the lowest temperature ( @xmath65 )",
    "a phononic fine structure can be clearly seen , superimposed on the magnon peaks .",
    "the width of each phononic peak is due to the intrinsic magnetic broadening @xmath51 described in ref . .",
    "it is exponentially small at this temperature , so that a small lorentzian broadening @xmath66 has been introduced for clarity . on the other hand ,",
    "the spread of the multiphonon structure gives rise to an overall width to the magnon peaks that is in good agreement with the expected value @xmath67 .    upon increasing the temperature to @xmath68 ,",
    "two different effects are visible .",
    "first , the width @xmath51 of each of the fine peaks increases due to the intrinsic magnetic broadening , leading to a much smoother curve ( this effect actually overcomes the small lorentzian broadening @xmath69 introduced previously ) . also , the overall spread of the multiphonon profiles increases due to the thermal phonon fluctuations , as expected for @xmath70",
    "finally , at @xmath71 , the system is so close to the paramagnetic phase that neither the phonon peaks nor the magnon structure can be resolved .    at this point",
    ", it is useful to comment about the effects of coherent hole propagation , that are implicitly neglected in our approach .",
    "these would induce a finite dispersion of order @xmath72 to the lowest energy magnon peak.@xcite it is clear that such dispersion would be visible only at sufficiently low temperatures and at moderate electron - phonon coupling strengths , when the energy scale @xmath2 is smaller than both the intrinsic magnetic broadening and the gaussian phonon spread , whereas in the opposite case it will presumably be hidden below a featureless background .",
    "these considerations give further support to the present dmft approach in the polaronic and/or high temperature regime , where neglecting the coherent hole propagation would not affect significantly the spectral properties .",
    "as we shall see below , this is even more true for what regards the finite - frequency optical conductivity , where any dispersive peak would be convolved in any case with high - energy featureless structures .",
    "the evaluation of the optical conductivity for a single hole is a delicate matter , which is only partly simplified in the context of dmft due to the absence of vertex corrections.@xcite a controlled procedure is derived in terms of an expansion of the inverse fugacity at finite temperature , performing the limit @xmath73 to enforce the thermodynamically vanishing particle density .",
    "we can thus define the optical conductivity per hole , @xmath74 , which is a finite quantity and which presents the same features as in the dilute ( but finite ) hole density limit . applying this formalism",
    "one derives a similar expression as obtained in refs .",
    ", here adapted to take into account the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "leaving once more the technical details in appendix [ app - sigma ] , we report here the main results .",
    "the optical conductivity per hole is expressed as @xmath75 ,   \\label{sigma } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 the last line defines a `` weighted spectral function '' , @xmath78 , which represents thermally excited states and plays an important role in the determination of the optical conductivity .",
    "let us remark that , although eqs .",
    "( [ sigma])-([wdos ] ) are formally analogous to those for the pure @xmath1-@xmath2 model , the electron - phonon interaction appears implicitly in them in the evaluation of the local green s function @xmath42 .",
    "note also that , in the paramagnetic limit @xmath79 , eqs .",
    "( [ sigma])-([wdos ] ) do not recover the results of the holstein model,@xcite because eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) involves the convolution of two _ local _ rather than * k*-_dependent _ propagators . as discussed above , this is due to the classical treatment of the spin degrees of freedom which does not allow for coherent transport , so that no drude peak is recovered in the present analysis .",
    "this , however , has only a minor influence on the finite - frequency optical conductivity , which is dominated by local incoherent excitations .    in order to assess the validity of the present treatment , we compare in fig .",
    "[ f - feshke ] the optical conductivity of the holstein-@xmath1-@xmath2 model in infinite dimensions , as described by eqs .",
    "( [ sigma])-([wdos ] ) , with numerical calculations using lanczos diagonalization for a single hole in the 2d holstein-@xmath1-@xmath2 model on a @xmath80 cluster.@xcite for technical reasons ( see discussion below ) , dmft data are averaged with a gaussian filter of amplitude @xmath81 such that phonon resonances are still well separated .",
    "microscopic values are @xmath82 , @xmath62 , @xmath83 , and @xmath20 ( for ref . ) and @xmath84 for the present results .",
    "these values correspond to a case where the lattice / magnetic polaron is formed and incoherent contributions to the optical conductivity are indeed dominant .",
    "the good agreement of the overall shape confirms the feasibility of our analysis to investigate the finite frequency optical conductivity .      as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the one - hole spectral function consists of a set of narrow bands whose width @xmath51 is controlled by the intrinsic magnetic broadening .",
    "this intrinsic width vanishes at low temperature due to the absence of spin - wave dispersion , making the direct evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ sigma])-([wdos ] ) quite hard to perform .",
    "special care is thus needed in order to calculate numerically the optical conductivity .",
    "we shall be mainly interested in the features of the optical conductivity that are related to the electron - lattice coupling .",
    "we shall therefore retain the details of the spectra on the scale of the phonon frequency @xmath56 . from the practical point of view",
    ", the primary object of our analysis will be a gaussian average of the optical conductivity @xmath0 with a gaussian filter of amplitude @xmath81.@xcite note that , even though the gaussian average preserves the total spectral weight of the original set of data , the accuracy of the final result will be limited by the finite frequency sampling @xmath85 . in explicit terms , if the spacing @xmath85 is larger than the intrinsic peak - width @xmath51 , the data sampling will probe the spectral features in a random way , yielding a highly inaccurate result for both the shape and spectral weight of the optical conductivity .",
    "this is shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ filtro ] where we plot the dependence of the ( gaussian averaged ) optical conductivity on the sampling spacing @xmath85 for different temperatures .",
    "at high temperature @xmath86 the intrinsic magnetic broadening @xmath51 is large enough so that both the shape and the total spectral weight of the optical conductivity are well captured even with a relatively large mesh ( @xmath87 ) . at lower temperature @xmath68",
    "however @xmath51 becomes so small that a much finer mesh ( @xmath88 ) is needed in order to get accurate results . at @xmath89 ,",
    "finally , no convergence is achieved even for the finest sampling mesh considered in this paper , @xmath90 ( in fig .",
    "[ filtro ] , for graphical reasons , we plot curves only up to @xmath88 ) .",
    "clearly , since the intrinsic peak - width @xmath51 vanishes exponentially at low @xmath91 , the problem evidenced here can not be solved by merely reducing the sampling mesh .    to overcome this difficulty we add to the system a small uncorrelated disorder with semielliptic distribution of amplitude @xmath92,@xcite which is able to yield a finite peak - width even in the zero temperature limit .",
    "we choose @xmath93 to assure a sufficiently dense mesh for an accurate sampling .",
    "we then scale @xmath94 keeping fixed the ratio @xmath95 in order to approach the correct physical limit in the absence of disorder .",
    "results obtained with a finite @xmath92 are shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ filtro ] .",
    "no appreciable difference is visible at high temperature @xmath86 where the thermally driven magnetic broadening @xmath51 is large enough to guarantee the convergence even in the absence of disorder . on the other hand",
    "our procedure provides a clear improvement already at @xmath68 where the convergence as function of the sampling spacing is more easily achieved in the presence of disorder ( note that the converged results coincide with the results for the most dense mesh in the _ absence _ of disorder , showing that no spurious structures appear due to our scaling procedure ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath89 the disorder scaling procedure is the only way to guarantee convergence of both the shape and the total spectral weight of the optical conductivity .      using the above described procedure",
    ", we shall now concentrate on the evolution of the optical conductivity in the adiabatic regime , fixing the ratio @xmath61 .",
    "this value is qualitatively representative of the cuprates , where the half - bandwidth @xmath96 ev and typical optical phonon frequencies @xmath97 mev .",
    "this regime is also the most interesting one from the theoretical point of view , since in this case the interplay between lattice and spin degrees of freedom has its most dramatic effects .",
    "[ fig : scanl ] shows the evolution of the optical absorption at fixed @xmath62 and low temperature @xmath98 , upon varying the electron - lattice coupling . at @xmath99 ,",
    "the result is very reminiscent of the spectra calculated for the pure @xmath1-@xmath2 model in ref . .",
    "it consists of a series of magnetic peaks , dominated by the sharp single - magnon peak located at @xmath100 and rapidly decaying at higher frequency . in this weak - coupling regime @xmath99 ,",
    "the electron - phonon interaction simply gives rise to a multi - phonon fine - structure with a gaussian profile .",
    "each magnon peak acquires thus a phonon - driven width without modifying however the overall distribution of spectral weight .    the main effect of increasing the electron - lattice coupling is a progressive shift of the spectral weight towards higher frequencies .",
    "this is an evidence of the formation of the lattice polaron , which occurs through a gradual crossover in the presence of a finite @xmath56 .",
    "increasing @xmath3 also modifies the shape of the low - energy absorption edge , converting the sharp magnon - peak at @xmath101 into a smoother gaussian lineshape , typical of polaronic absorption . in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath102 ) ,",

    "this change in the nature of the thermally excited states is at the origin of both the opening of a polaronic pseudogap and of the smoothening of the features observed in @xmath0 .",

    "one of the main effects is the emergence of a dispersive pole with small spectral weight in the one - particle spectral function . in the optical spectra , this gives rise to a drude - like low - frequency response , but it does not affect the high - frequency incoherent part ( moreover the coherent spectral weight is strongly reduced when the electron - lattice coupling is turned on ) .",

    "this would affect our results only in the weak electron - phonon coupling regime , where no lattice polaron is formed .",
