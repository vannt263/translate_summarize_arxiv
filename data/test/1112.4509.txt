    "the description of the high energy limit of perturbative qcd is generally given in terms of high energy factorization and the bfkl evolution .",
    "the latter resums large logarithms in the center of mass energy @xmath0 at leading ( ll ) @xcite and next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy @xcite .",
    "its derivation is closely related to the observation that qcd scattering amplitudes reveal in the high energy limit an effective @xmath1-channel degree of freedom , the reggeized gluon , which couples to the external scattering particles through effective vertices .",
    "determination of both effective couplings and higher order corrections to reggeized gluon exchange is a highly non - trivial task .",
    "this is especially true if one attempts to go beyond leading order accuracy  something which is needed for _",
    "e.g. _ a successful phenomenology of the qcd high energy limit .",
    "an efficient tool to address these questions is given by lipatov s high energy effective action @xcite .",
    "it is based on the qcd action with the addition of an induced term .",
    "the latter is written in terms of gauge - invariant currents which generate a non - trivial coupling of the gluon to reggeized gluon fields .",
    "the effective action allows to address both unitarization of bfkl evolution and the systematic determination of higher order perturbative corrections to high energy qcd amplitudes .",
    "while the high energy limit of qcd tree - level amplitudes can be obtained in a straightforward manner from the effective action @xcite , in loop corrections a new type of longitudinal divergences , not present in conventional qcd amplitudes , appear .",
    "the treatment of these divergences has been at first addressed for leading order transition kernels @xcite and the study of the leading order reggeized gluon - gluon - 2 reggeized gluon ( rg2r ) production vertex in @xcite .",
    "recently the effective action has been used for the first time for the calculation of nlo corrections to the forward quark jet impact factor @xcite and the quark part of the 2-loop gluon trajectory @xcite , finding precise agreement with previous results in the literature .    in these studies of loop corrections",
    "it has been further necessary to give a prescription for circumventing light - cone singularities on the complex plane .",
    "the latter appear due to a non - local operator in the induced term of the effective action which describes the coupling of reggeized gluons to conventional gluons .",
    "locality of the effective action in rapidity space and high energy kinematics prevent in principle the light - cone momenta in these denominators to take non - zero values .",
    "a prescription for these poles seems not to be necessary . that this is true is evident in the case of tree - level amplitudes in the ( quasi-)multi - regge - kinematics .",
    "it seems furthermore reasonable to expect that a similar statement holds for corresponding virtual corrections . on the other hand all regularizations",
    "used up till now need a prescription for these denominators .",
    "other regularizations which contain more physical insight are surely possible , but remain to be explored . in this work",
    "we therefore give a pole prescription which can be applied in combination with regularization methods used so far .    to leading order ( lo ) in the gauge coupling @xmath2 , the order @xmath2 induced vertex has so far been interpreted as a cauchy principal value @xcite .",
    "higher order induced vertices seem to require a more elaborate prescription .",
    "in particular interpreting nively every single pole of the higher vertices as a cauchy principal value destroys parts of the symmetry of the unregulated vertices and can lead to incorrect results , see for instance @xcite .    in the following we",
    "provide a pole prescription of higher order induced vertices which respects the symmetry properties of the unregulated vertices and which can be motivated through the high energy expansion of qcd scattering amplitudes .",
    "we will present explicit results up to the order @xmath3 induced vertex which can be directly used for calculations within the effective action such as the determination of the gluon part of the 2-loop gluon regge trajectory , corrections to gluon induced production processes and studies of multiple reggeized gluon exchanges within the effective action .",
