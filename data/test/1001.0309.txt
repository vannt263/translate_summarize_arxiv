    "@xcite have studied the balance dynamics on the social networks based on the notion of _ social balance _ @xcite . in the networks , each node is connected to all the others , representing each person knows all the others in the society .",
    "each edge in the networks has two values , + 1 and -1 .",
    "if the edge is + 1 , it means the two persons are friendly with each other .",
    "if the edge is -1 , it means the two persons are hostile towards each other . at every step , they choose a triangle randomly from the network .",
    "if the product of the three edges is + 1 , the triangle is stable . otherwise , if the product is -1 , the triangle is unstable . for the stable triangle",
    ", it satisfies ( i ) the friend of my friend being my friend ; ( ii ) the enemy of my friend being my enemy ; ( iii ) the friend of my enemy being my enemy ; and ( iv ) the enemy of my enemy being my friend .",
    "the unstable triangles always try to be stable , but the final state of the network depends on the edge flipping probability @xmath0 , which is set manually . if @xmath1 , the network will reach the state of `` paradise '' , with all relations being friendly .",
    "several studies around the balance dynamics have been carried out , including the studies of the university class of triad dynamics @xcite and the satisfiability problem of computer science @xcite , etc .    in the first half of this paper , at first based on ref .",
    "@xcite , we map the edge relations to the node relations with some relaxation , so there are two opposing opinions in the network . we suppose for each triad relation in the social networks , it will change from stable to unstable or the reverse , caused by the change of some persons opinions in it . while for the change , the person s opinion depending both on the other opinions in the triad relation and the opinions all around him .",
    "next , considering in the social networks , there being two opposing opinions is extreme , we introduce the neutral opinion .",
    "so the values of each node are generalized to + 1 , 0 and -1 , and the metastable triad relations appear .",
    "we find the densities of each triad relation associated with the hamiltonian and the geometrical temperature which is determined by the structure of the network without manual setting .",
    "based on our model , we obtain the distributions of each triad relation and the time needed for dynamic balance both for the binary and ternary cases .    in the latter half of this paper , we study the self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite on the ternary social networks",

    ", in the society , if one relation changes from one state into anther , it may affect other relations associating with it .",

    "@xcite for details . in this paper",
    ", we study the soc on the ternary social networks based on our model and the evolving rules , along with two modifications compared to sec .",
    "the first modification is the structure of the network .",
    "because for a completely connected network , any disturbance is globe , with no propagation , so the occurrence of the avalanche will not follow the power - law form either spatially or temporally . besides , compared to the completely connected network , the regular network or the small - world network @xcite is closer to the real structure of the society .",

    "the second modification is the judgement of a triad relation . in order to embody the majority principle",
    ", we take the judgement as the gauge invariance or the gauge variance @xcite , which is explained as follows . under this judgement",
    ", the triad relation evolves from one state to the other by changing node s value .    if the value of a node being + 1 , it means the person shows the friendly face in the triad relation , and always tires to keep the relation stable .",
    "if the value being -1 , it means the person shows the hostile face , and always tries to destroy the stability of the triad relation .",
    "while the value being 0 , it means the person does not care whether the triad relation is stable or not .",
    "so we propose if the friendly faces are in the majority , the triad relation is in one state , or the gauge invariance state .",
    "while the hostile faces are in the majority , the triad relation is in the other state , or the gauge variance state .",
    "the explicit expressions of the gauge invariance and the gauge variance states @xcite are as follows .    for each triad relation",
    ", we propose if @xmath89 it satisfies the gauge invariance . if @xmath90 the triad relation does not satisfy the gauge invariance . here",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are the values of the three nodes of the triangle .",

    "[ a1-a4 ] and fig .",
    "[ a5-a10 ] .",
    "we study the ternary network in association with the potts spin systems .",
    "since each node has three values , the way of spin changing is the spin transition @xcite .",
    "besides , we propose the spin transition depends both on itself and the surroundings @xcite .",
    "considering the soc is determined by the structure of the system , we set the geometric temperature as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the final value of @xmath98 , and @xmath99 the average value of all neighboring spins of @xmath98 .",

    "in order to avoid the denominator of @xmath17 being zero , we propose if the final value of the spin results in @xmath104 , it happens with probability zero , while the other values happen with probability one .",
