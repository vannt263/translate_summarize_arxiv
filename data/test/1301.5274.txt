    "the origin of cosmic rays is an unsolved problem since the discovery in 1912 .",
    "the spectrum of cosmic rays has a break at the knee energy ( @xmath4  ev ) , and those below the knee energy are believed to have galactic origin .",
    "recently , the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) found more than 50 sources on the galactic plane in the very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath5  gev ) gamma - ray band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . because vhe gamma - rays are produced either through inverse compton scattering of low energy photons by relativistic electrons , or through the decay of pions produced by collisions of relativistic protons with interstellar medium , high energy particles are surely present in the vhe gamma - ray sources .",
    "if relativistic electrons are present , they may be traced through the observations of synchrotron x - ray emission .",
    "however , in spite of extensive x - ray followup observations , a non - negligible fraction of the galactic vhe gamma - ray sources do not have an x - ray counterpart , and they are referred to as unidentified ( unid ) sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    among identified galactic vhe gamma - ray sources , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) represent the largest population @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one would expect that pwne are the first candidate of the origin of the unid vhe gamma - ray sources .",
    "however , identifying the vhe gamma - ray sources as pwne is not straightforward .",
    "the vhe gamma - ray emission region sometimes shows significant spatial offset from the x - ray emission region or a pulsar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the life time of x - ray emitting electrons through synchrotron emission may be shorter than that of vhe gamma - ray emitting electrons through compton scattering .",
    "this means that x - ray emission from the pwne can be much dimmer than the vhe gamma - rays if the pwne are old .",
    "finally , a pulsar is not always found in the vicinity of ( candidate ) pwne .",
    "hess  j1427608 is one of the unid vhe gamma - ray sources located at @xmath6 @xcite , and is extended with @xmath7 .",
    "the flux is @xmath8 in the 110  tev band with a photon index of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "no plausible counterpart is listed in the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) catalog @xcite or in the simbad data base in the vicinity of hess  j1427608 .",
    "we also looked for a possible counterpart in the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite .",
    "however , no energetic pulsar was found within from hess  j1427608 . here",
    ", the definition of the energetic pulsar is those with @xmath10  erg  s@xmath11  kpc@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spin - down energy and @xmath14 is the distance to the source .",
    "this search radius of is large enough compared to offsets of radio pulsars to vhe sources among known pwn systems , and virtually excludes the possibility of associating hess j1427608 with any known energetic radio pulsar .",
    "thus , hess  j1427608 seems to be one of the most `` unlikely '' pwne among the vhe gamma - ray sources . in order to search for an x - ray counterpart",
    ", we observed hess  j1427608 with suzaku , and also analyzed the xmm - newton archive data .",
    "we observed the sky region including hess  j1427608 with suzaku ( @xcite ) from 2010 january 13 through 16 .",
    "the journal of the observation is listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "suzaku is equipped with two types of detectors : four sets of x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis0xis3 : @xcite ) and a non - imaging hard x - ray detector ( hxd : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "xis1 uses the back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd while the others the front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds . among the four sensors ,",
    "xis2 is not operational and a part of xis0 ( corresponding to the off - source region in the latter analysis ) is not usable due to its anomaly . hereafter ,",
    "unless otherwise mentioned , we used only xis1 and xis3 data for the current analysis .",
    "xis was operated in normal clocking mode without any window options .",
    "spaced - row charge injection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) was used to reduce the effects of radiation damage .",
    "we used version 2.4.12.27 of the processed data for hess  j1427608 .",
    "the data was analyzed with the headas software version 6.10 and xspec version 12.6.0 .",
    "we used the cleaned event file created by the suzaku team .",
    "the resultant effective exposure was 104  ks .",
    "figure 1 shows xis images in the soft ( 0.52  kev ) and the hard ( 28  kev ) bands .",
    "the images were corrected for exposure using an exposure map generated by the ftool xisexpmapgen after subtracting non x - ray background ( nxb ) images generated by the ftool xisnxbgen @xcite .",
    "finally , the xis1 and xis3 images were added , and the resulting image was binned to a pixel size of and smoothed with a gaussian of @xmath15 .",
    "the position center and the extent of hess  j1427608 are shown as a black cross and a yellow dashed circle , respectively .",
    "a few faint , point - like sources are seen in the soft band , while an apparently extended source is detected in the hard band .",
    "the position and apparent extension of the hard source match those of hess  j1427608 . as will be shown in a later section , all the suzaku soft - band sources",
    "may be explained by the point - like sources in the xmm - newton archive data while the suzaku hard - band source seems to be a truly new source .",
    "we thus designate the central hard - band source suzaku  j14276051 , and mainly focus on this source in the following analysis .",
    "because hess  j1427608 and suzaku  j14276051 are both extended , we evaluate the x - ray size of the source .",
    "for this purpose , careful estimation of the x - ray background is necessary since suzaku  j14276051 is relatively faint . in particular",
    ", this region contains significant contribution from the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) as well as the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , both of which are subject to mirror vignetting effect resulting in a centrally - peaked spatial distribution .",
    "therefore , it is not appropriate to assume a flat background image defined at an off - source region within the field of view ( fov ) . instead , we estimated the grxe+cxb image in the source region through monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we explain details of the x - ray background estimation below .",
    "first , we estimated the surface brightness of the grxe and cxb assuming their uniform distribution in the sky . for this purpose",
    ", we analyzed the x - ray spectrum in the off - source annulus region shown in figure  [ fig : xisspecreg ] .",
    "the region ( between and from the center of suzaku  j14276051 ) was selected to minimize contamination from suzaku  j14276051 . in other words ,",
    "the off - source region contains only the grxe and the cxb after the subtraction of nxb .",
    "figure  [ fig : xisanuspec ] shows the spectra extracted from the off - source region .",
    "the spectra were modeled by optically thin thermal three temperature plasma with neutral iron emission line plus the cxb following @xcite .",
    "in the course of model fitting , the hydrogen column density was fixed to @xmath16 determined by hi observations ( @xcite ) , the photon index of the cxb to 1.4 , and the surface brightness of the cxb to @xmath17 in the 210  kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "we made the ancillary response file using the ftool xissimarfgen assuming a uniform emission in the sky .",
    "the model could reproduce the observed spectrum well .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : xisanuspec ] .",
    "next , we simulated the grxe+cxb event data assuming uniform emission with the best - fit spectrum model determined above using the ftool xissim @xcite . in order to avoid an extra ambiguity due to poor statistics , the exposure time for the simulation",
    "was set to 500 ks .",
    "then we extracted the grxe+cxb spectrum in the source region and added it to the nxb in the source region to obtain the total background spectrum , following the instruction in section 5.5.2 of the suzaku technical description .",
    "figure  [ fig : xisspeccomp ] shows the simulated background spectra of the xis1 and xis3 respectively as well as the source and off - source spectra . as can be seen from the spectra , the source region contains significant emission above the grxe+cxb level .",
    "figure  [ fig : xisprof ] shows the radial profiles of the nxb - subtracted image and the simulated grxe+cxb image in the 28  kev band .",
    "the difference is attributed to suzaku  j14276051 . even if we consider the relatively broad half - power radius (;",
    "@xcite ) of the point spread function of suzaku mirror , suzaku  j14276051 is clearly extended . in order to estimate the source extent , we compared the observed radial profile with that of a model calculation for an extended source having a 2d - gaussian distribution . instead of performing the @xmath18 fitting , we calculated @xmath18 for a set of @xmath19 , i.e. , , , , and .",
    "the simulated profiles were generated with xissim .",
    "it turned out that none of them gave an acceptable fit ; the radial profile of suzaku  j14276051 has a core and a tail in comparison with the best - fit simulation data .",
    "we thus performed the @xmath18 test using only the core region ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we then could obtain an acceptable fit ( @xmath21 for 3 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the best - fit value obtained was @xmath0 with 90% confidence level .",
    "although suzaku  j14276051 is extended , we tried to search for pulsations in the xis light curve as point sources may be hidden in the image .",
    "we extracted light curves of the source region in the 0.510  kev band and binned them to a time resolution of 16 sec .",
    "we calculated fourier power spectra every 2048  bin ( @xmath22  9.1  hour ) using the ftool powspec to obtain the ensemble - averaged power spectrum density ( psd ) .",
    "the psd of xis1 is dominated by the orbital period of the satellite and its higher harmonics , probably due to the contamination of earth albedo .",
    "thus we used only the psd of xis3 in the subsequent analysis .",
    "no significant peak was detected in the psd with an upper limit of @xmath23 ( poisson fluctuation level was normalized to 2.0 ) , which corresponds to an rms amplitude of 0.0064  count  s@xmath11 .",
    "because the net count rate of the source is 0.021  count  s@xmath11 , this corresponds to a relative amplitude of 31% .",
    "thus we conclude that no coherent pulsation is present in the light curves of suzaku j14276051 with an upper limit of 31 % between the pulse periods of 32  sec and 32768  sec .",
    "figure  [ fig : xisspec ] shows the background - subtracted energy spectra of suzaku  j14276051 . here",
    ", the background spectrum ( sum of grxe , cxb , and nxb ) was calculated with the method detailed in section  [ subsec : xisimage ] .",
    "it is found that the spectrum of suzaku  j14276051 is featureless and heavily absorbed .",
    "although a hint of feature is seen in the 67  kev band , which may be due to the spacial variation of the iron emission line in grxe , it is not statistically significant .",
    "we calculated the ancillary response file using the ftool xissimarfgen for an extended source of a gaussian profile with @xmath24 .",
    "the spectrum was well modeled by either an absorbed power - law or a thermal model , whose best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : xisparm ] . however ,",
    "a thermal origin is unlikely because the abundance is unreasonably small , and the x - rays are thus considered to be produced by non - thermal processes .",
    "the absorbed x - ray flux of the source is @xmath25 in the 210  kev band .",
    "we also analyzed the spectrum of the hxd to search for emission of suzaku  j14276051 above 10  kev .",
    "we used the background spectrum called `` bgd_d '' provided by the suzaku team @xcite and added the cxb to it using the ftool hxdpinnxbpi .",
    "we used the xis nominal - position response file categorized to epoch 6 , released as a caldb .",
    "we made the background - subtracted spectrum and fitted it with a power - law , whose photon index was fixed to @xmath26 , as derived from the xis analysis .",
    "the flux in the 1540  kev band is ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) if no systematic error is taken into account .",
    "based on @xcite , who showed the reproducibility of nxb in the 1540  kev band is about 3% in the 90% confidence range , we constructed the nxb spectra with 3% higher count rates to include the systematic error of the nxb reproduction .",
    "then , a significant signal is no longer detected .",
    "we thus obtained the 90% upper limit of @xmath30 in the 1540  kev band .",
    "in order to estimate the contribution of point sources , we analyzed the archival data of xmm - newton including the hess  j1427608 field .",
    "xmm - newton ( @xcite ) carries three x - ray telescopes each equipped with a european photon imaging camera ( epic ) at the foci .",
    "epic consists of two mos ccd camera ( mos1 and mos2 : @xcite ) and a pn ccd camera ( pn : @xcite ) .",
    "the observation was carried out on 2007 august 9 for 24  ks . during the observation , epic was operated in full - frame mode with medium filter .",
    "the data were analyzed with the science analysis software ( sas ) version 10.0.0 , headas version 6.10 and xspec version 12.6.0 .",
    "time intervals of enhanced background , which are caused by soft proton flares , were removed with thresholds of 0.20  count  s@xmath11 for mos1 , 0.24  count  s@xmath11 for mos2 , and 0.6  count  s@xmath11 for pn , respectively , calculated for pattern=0 events above 10  kev .",
    "we used x - ray events of pattern=012 ( for mos cameras ) and pattern=04 ( for pn camera ) for the image and spectral analyses .",
    "the resultant effective exposures were 21  ks ( mos1 ) , 22  ks ( mos2 ) , and 15  ks ( pn ) , respectively .",
    "the journal of the observation is listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : epicimage ] shows the summed images of mos1 and mos2 in the soft ( 0.32  kev ) and the hard ( 212  kev ) bands .",
    "the xis images are also overlaid in green contours . using the sas tool edetect_chain ,",
    "a total of 16 point sources were detected within from the center of suzaku  j14276051 .",
    "eleven and seven sources were found in the soft and the hard bands , respectively , and two sources were commonly detected in both bands .",
    "names and count rates of the point sources are listed in table  [ tab : xmmps ] .",
    "summing up the count rates of the point sources located within the suzaku source region ( x1 through x7 ) , we obtained @xmath31  count  s@xmath11 in the 0.52  kev band .",
    "this may be converted to the xis bi count rate of @xmath32  count  s@xmath11 assuming the power - law spectrum in table 2 . because this is comparable to the rate actually observed with suzaku ( @xmath33  count  s@xmath11 ) ,",
    "the xis data may be explained by the sum of the xmm - newton point sources in the soft band .",
    "on the other hand , if we carry out a similar calculation for the hard band , the xmm - newton point sources would produce @xmath34   count  s@xmath11 in xis .",
    "because this corresponds to only @xmath35  % of the actual xis count rate , suzaku  j14276051 is difficult to be explained by the sum of the sources and may be a truly diffuse source .",
    "we calculated the energy spectra of only x1 and of the summed spectra of the central seven point sources ( x1 through x7 ) .",
    "we made the response file and the ancillary response file using the sas tool rmfgen and arfgen , respectively .",
    "we fitted these spectra with the model of an absorbed power - law .",
    "because of the poor statistics , the photon index was fixed to 3.1 , which was determined by the spectral analysis of suzaku  j14276051 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : epicparm ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : epicspec ] shows the summed spectra of the seven point sources .",
    "the absorbed x - ray flux of the summed spectra was @xmath36 in the 210  kev band , which is about 5% of the flux derived with suzaku for suzaku  j14276051 .",
    "it is also found that the column density of the summed spectra is two orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for suzaku  j14276051 .",
    "these results confirm that suzaku  j14276051 can not be explained by the xmm - newton point sources .",
    "we discovered an apparently - diffuse hard x - ray source , suzaku  j14276051 with suzaku , and several point sources with xmm - newton in spatial coincidence with hess  j1427608 .",
    "we found that suzaku  j14276051 could not be explained by the sum of the point sources detected with xmm - newton , and concluded that it is a truly diffuse source . even if time variability of the detected point - like sources is considered , it is unlikely that suzaku  j14276051 is explained by them because the hydrogen column densities are quite different .",
    "the xmm - newton point sources are most likely foreground sources . to explain",
    "suzaku  j14276051 by the sum of several point sources would require that all those sources would be below detection threshold at the time of the xmm - newton observation , which appears very unlikely .",
    "thus , we concluded that suzaku  j14276051 is an intrinsically diffuse source and the x - ray counterpart of hess  j1427608 .",
    "we searched various catalogs and literature for the possible counterpart of hess  j1427608 in other wavebands .",
    "a gev gamma - ray source , 2fgl  j1427.66048c , is listed in the 2-year catalog of fermi ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gev source is located at @xmath37 , which is away from the center of hess  j1427608 ( see figure  [ fig : xisimage ] ) . since the error radius of the position is about ,",
    "it may be associated with hess  j1427608 @xcite . however ,",
    "this is a `` c - designator - applied ''",
    "fermi source whose position , emission characteristics , or even existence may not be reliable due to a potential confusion with interstellar emission @xcite .",
    "we believe it is premature to discuss a possible association of the gev source to hess  j1427608 ; future fermi data and analysis is necessary .",
    "we also searched the akari point source catalogues ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "no point source was found in the mid - infrared ( @xmath38 m ) and the far - infrared ( @xmath39 m ) bands within from the center of hess  j1427608 .",
    "although we mentioned hess  j1427608 as one of the most `` unlikely '' pwne in the introduction , its center - filled morphology and featureless spectrum in the x - ray band suggest that the source could be a pwn .",
    "thus we postulate here that the source is a pwn as a working hypothesis",
    ". figure  [ fig : wideband ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from x - rays to vhe gamma - rays .",
    "the estimated synchrotron spectra from the vhe gamma - ray spectrum @xcite , assuming that the same electron population would inverse - compton scatter cmb photons up to vhe gamma - rays and radiate synchrotron emission in x - rays , are also plotted with a local magnetic field @xmath40 of 1 , 3 , and 10@xmath41 .",
    "this sed plot indicates that the simple one - zone leptonic model with @xmath40 of about 5@xmath42 g would roughly explain both the x - ray and vhe gamma - ray data . in this context",
    ", the steep suzaku spectrum of @xmath43 could indicate that the suzaku energy band is higher than the cut - off energy .",
    "the inferred magnetic field strength of @xmath225@xmath42 g is within the range of typical values on the galactic plane .",
    "thus the sed is consistent with a one - zone leptonic model expected for pwne .",
    "we next examine the flux ratio and luminosities . the x - ray to vhe gamma - ray ratio is useful to probe the nature of unid sources @xcite . in the case of hess",
    "j1427608 , the unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath44 of @xmath45 ( 210  kev ) and the vhe gamma - ray flux @xmath46 of @xmath47 ( 110 tev ) result in a flux ratio of @xmath48 .",
    "if we assume a distance to hess  j1427608 of @xmath49  kpc , the x - ray luminosity would be @xmath50 .",
    "the estimated flux ratio and x - ray luminosity are within the values of known x - ray and vhe gamma - ray emitting pwne , given that both values show a large scatter : @xmath51 in @xmath52 and @xmath53  erg  s@xmath11 in @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "thus the flux ratio and luminosity are also consistent with sources of pwn origin .    while there are observational evidences supporting the pwn origin as discussed above , others challenge such a view . with the assumption of @xmath49  kpc ,",
    "the core size and whole radial extent would be 2  pc and 12  pc , respectively .",
    "the core size of 2  pc is a little large , but not exceptional among other pwn @xcite .",
    "the whole extent of 12  pc is not surprisingly large compared with the nebula of e.g. , psr  j18261334 @xcite .",
    "the largest drawback of the pwn hypothesis is lacking the detection of both a pulsar and radio pwn associated .",
    "it is known that the pulsar luminosity and its nebula luminosity in the x - ray band are correlated over 7 orders of magnitude @xcite . according to the correlation",
    ", the not - yet - detected pulsar should be brighter than @xmath55 in x - rays , one - tenth of the pwn luminosity . such a pulsar would have been easily detected with xmm - newton .",
    "in addition , the x - ray photon index of the nebula ( @xmath56 ) is very steep among the known x - ray nebulae most of which have a @xmath57 between 1.22.2 @xcite .    in terms of photon",
    "index comparison , non - thermal snrs might present a more plausible scenario than pwne .",
    "most of non - thermal snrs radiate synchrotron x - rays with a photon index of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and extent are also compatible to synchrotron snrs @xcite .",
    "however , the facts that the source has a center - filled morphology in the x - ray band and no detection of the shell structure in the radio band hamper the interpretation as a non - thermal snr .    in summary , we have not reached a firm conclusion on the nature of hess  j1427608 .",
    "pwn and/or non - thermal snr , which are not necessary exclusive to each other , are the prime candidates but a decisive observational evidence is lacking . increasing statistics in fermi data",
    "may reveal a pulsation from 2fgl  j1427.66048c",
    ". a deep radio observation would also be helpful if it could detect pulsations or reveal the morphology of the source .",
    "we observed hess  j1427608 with suzaku , which is combined with the archival data analysis of xmm - newton , and obtained following results .    *",
    "we discovered an x - ray counterpart , suzaku  j14276051 , of hess  j1427608 .",
    "it is intrinsically extended ( @xmath59 ) and has a spectral shape of an absorbed power - law with a photon index of @xmath2 .",
    "* several faint point sources were found in spatial coincidence with hess  j1427608 using xmm - newton archival data in the soft x - ray band . *",
    "observational properties of suzaku  j14276051 and hess  j1427608 are compared with those of known pwne and non - thermal snrs .",
