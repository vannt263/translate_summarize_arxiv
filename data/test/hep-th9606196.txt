    "studies of string theory have traditionally been performed perturbatively@xcite .",
    "these studies have led to great insight over the years into a rich theory of gravity and possibly the other interactions of the physical world .",
    "however , many vital issues have had to be left to await the advent of a non  perturbative understanding of string theory .",
    "such an understanding has begun to emerge over the last year or so .",
    "we are still quite a way ( it  seems ) from addressing real world problems with these new studies , but the time will surely come when we will begin to see if we can understand more about nature with this approach .",
    "many of the exciting results from strong coupling string theory have been obtained ( or confirmed ) with the package of techniques@xcite  involving * ` orientifolds'*@xcite  and * ` d  branes'*@xcite .",
    "generally , d  branes are simply a more precise language with which we can construct perturbative string backgrounds .",
    "the advantages come mainly from the fact that certain properties of d  branes allow us to make powerful statements about such perturbative backgrounds which remain true beyond perturbation theory .",
    "there are five basic superstring theories which may be perturbatively formulated in ten dimensions@xcite :      the type iia and type iib theories describe two closed string theories which arise from the choice of how one puts together the right and left moving world ",
    "sheet sectors to yield the generators of @xmath1 spacetime supersymmetry .",
    "choice  @xmath2 corresponds to realising a left  moving spinor and a right  moving spinor .",
    "choice  @xmath3 corresponds to realising spinors of the same chirality , giving rise to a chiral theory .",
    "the heterotic string theories describe closed strings with one supersymmetry from either the left or right moving sector .",
    "the other sector is not supersymmetric , and instead has a current algebra which gives rise to spacetime gauge symmetry @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the type  i theory is a theory of open strings , with gauge symmetry @xmath4 .",
    "we shall review it in some detail in the next section , and recall how to realise it as the simplest example of an orientifold , involving d  branes .",
    "recall that for the type iib theory , there was a symmetry between left and right moving structures on the world sheet .",
    "let us call the generator of this symmetry @xmath6 .",
    "it is simply world sheet parity , exchanging left with right .",
    "we can try to construct a new string theory by gauging this symmetry : project out all states in the theory which are not invariant under @xmath6 .",
    "this results in a new closed string theory which is unorientable ( the left and right are now indistinguishable ) and so the world sheets for string perturbation theory are unorientable .",
    "it is also an @xmath0 supersymmetric theory , the supersymmetry generator being a linear combination of the two which we started with .",
    "unfortunately , it is inconsistent .",
    "for example , at one loop there is a divergence in the klein bottle diagram :    = 1.5 in    meanwhile , one might try to construct a purely open @xmath0 superstring theory , endowing the string endpoints with charges ( * ` chan  paton factors ' * ) in the fundamental of some group @xmath7 .",
    "this open string theory has spacetime gauge symmetry group @xmath7 .",
    "( a massless spin one excitation with values in the adjoint of @xmath7 appears . )    unfortunately , it is also divergent at one loop where the string theory tries to emit massless closed string states .",
    "there are two such divergent one loop diagrams :    = 2.5 in    if we realise that the closed string sector appearing at one loop for this open string theory and the closed string we got from gauging @xmath6 in the iib theory are to be identified , we have a chance of cancelling these divergences against one another , leaving a consistent theory .",
    "the three divergent diagrams which occur are the mbius strip , klein bottle and cylinder :    = 3.0 in    it turns out that the divergences are given by a piece which is common to all of the amplitudes , times @xmath8 for the klein bottle , @xmath9 for the mbius strip and @xmath10 for the cylinder , for chan  paton factors corresponding to a gauge group @xmath11 for the @xmath12  sign , and @xmath13 for the @xmath14  sign .",
    "this can be written as @xmath15 , which cancels to zero for gauge group @xmath4 .",
    "we have thus recovered another chiral @xmath0 spacetime supersymmetric string theory , with gauge group @xmath4 , this time an open string theory .",
    "we shall soon reinterpret this computation in the language of d  branes .      in types",
    "iia and iib string theory , there are the usual massless fields , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , ( graviton , dilaton and antisymmetric 2form tensor ) of a relativistic closed string , coming from the neveu  schwarz - neveu  schwarz ( ns - ns ) sector .",
    "it is sometimes useful to think of the fundamental iia or iib string as carrying electric @xmath18 charge , where @xmath18 is the 3form field strength of the potential @xmath17 .",
    "the two dimensional worldsheet of the string has a natural coupling to the 2form potential @xmath17 .",
    "( analogous to the familiar case of a charged particle coupling naturally to the 1form maxwell potential of electromagnetism via its world  line . )",
    "there are also antisymmetric @xmath19form fields @xmath20 , coming from the ramond - ramond ( r - r ) sector . for type  iia",
    "there are @xmath21 and @xmath22 and for type  iib , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "imagine an extended object in the theory with @xmath19  spatial dimensions .",
    "( @xmath25 for a string  like object ) .",
    "imagine further that such an object arises if there is a @xmath26form in the theory to couple naturally to its @xmath26dimensional world volume .",
    "such objects are called * ` p  branes'*@xcite .",
    "so @xmath19branes with @xmath19 odd will arise in  iib string theory while for @xmath19 even , they arise in type  iia theory .",
    "they have ( electric ) charge @xmath27 with respect to the field strength @xmath28 .",
    "ten  dimensional hodge duality tells us that a @xmath19brane also carries magnetic charge with respect to a form @xmath29 and is therefore dual to a @xmath30brane .",
    "a generalisation of dirac s",
    "argument@xcite  for electric and magnetic charges must apply here , setting the fundamental units of electric and magnetic charge .",
    "it transpires@xcite  that there is a special class of @xmath19branes which _ carry the most basic unit of @xmath28 charge allowed : _ they are called * ` d ",
    "branes'*. we may think of d  branes as the consequence of considering more general boundary conditions in string theory . the world ",
    "volume of the d ",
    "brane is the sub  manifold in spacetime upon which strings may have end  points .",
    "specifically , the ` d@xmath19brane ' is defined by neumann boundary conditions in @xmath26 directions ( the world ",
    "volume ) and dirichlet in the remaining transverse directions .",
    "the pure open string theory we saw earlier is a very special example of a d  brane configuration : spacetime itself contains d9branes ( with a ten dimensional world ",
    "the ( chan  paton ) internal degree of freedom is the choice that a string endpoint has about which d9brane it can end on .",
    "gauge group @xmath4 corresponds to the presence of 32 d9branes .",
    "think of the diagrams above as cylinders with either open string boundaries or crosscaps at either end .",
    "the boundary is a d9brane .",
    "the divergences come from the regions of moduli space where the cylinders lengths go to infinity . in this limit ,",
    "the dominant contribution is from massless states in the closed string sector propagating .",
    "we may think@xcite  of the above cancellation as being between * tadpoles * coming from the emission of massless closed string states from a d9brane ( via the boundary term ) , or from the vacuum ( via the crosscap ) .",
    "= 1.5 in    this cancellation is associated with d9branes .",
    "it is a requirement for consistency of the field equations of the 10form r - r potential@xcite .",
    "another useful way to see the d  branes quite clearly is to imagine that the tenth dimension @xmath32 is a circle of radius @xmath33 . *",
    "` @xmath31duality ' * along @xmath32 gives an open string theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath34 which describes the same physics in new variables@xcite .",
    "@xmath31duality is a symmetry which can be described perturbatively as an action on the world sheet fields of the string theory@xcite .",
    "one of its operations is to exchange dirichlet with neumann boundary conditions along the @xmath35 direction .",
    "this turns the 32 d9branes into 32 d8branes .",
    "their world ",
    "volume is along the @xmath36 directions .",
    "also , the action of @xmath6 gets converted to a manifest spacetime reflection symmetry .",
    "the d8branes have a transverse position coordinate on the @xmath32 circle ( below , a line denotes the whole world - volume ; a dotted line is an orientifold plane about which there is a reflection ) :    = 3.0 in    the one  loop diagrams seen earlier can be seen to arise clearly here as fundamental strings stretching between different branes . in the figure",
    ", the cylinder ( c ) is formed of strings stretching between distinct branes , while the mbius strip ( ms ) comes from strings stretching between a brane and its mirror forming a one  loop diagram with a single boundary .",
    "it also can be seen here is that @xmath4 is an enhanced gauge symmetry which occurs when the 32 branes and their images are all coincident .",
    "moving them away from each other is equivalent to introducing wilson lines in the dual picture to break some of the gauge symmetry",
    ". a single isolated d ",
    "brane has gauge symmetry @xmath37 .",
    "enhanced gauge symmetry arises when extra modes become massless , originating from strings stretched between coincident d  branes .",
    "an important class of states in supersymmetric theories are those which saturate a bogomolnyi  prasad  sommerfield@xcite  ( * bps * ) bound .",
    "this is a lower bound on the mass of a state with respect to the central charges of the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "well known examples of such states are furnished by the soliton sector of supersymmetric field theories .",
    "there are a number of interesting and important properties of bps states ( see ref.@xcite  for more discussion and references ) :    * they break half the supersymmetry : half of the supercharges annihilate them , the other half do nt .",
    "* the force between such bps states is zero . *",
    "the spectrum of masses and charges of bps states in a given theory is exact : it may be computed at weak coupling , and then there is a non  renormalisation theorem which protects this spectrum from corrections , to all orders in perturbation theory .    _ d  branes are bps states@xcite_. they break half the supersymmetries , have zero force between each other , and their masses@xcite  ( @xmath38 ) saturate the bound .",
    "in the field theory examples of strong  weak coupling duality , one of the basic phenomena is the exchange of roles of the light , ` fundamental ' charge carriers ( electrons ) with the heavy ` solitonic ' dual degrees of freedom ( monopoles ) , as the coupling goes large .    in a supersymmetric setting , these solitons will be bps states whose properties we can study , trusting that these properties will survive at strong coupling .    many of the strong  weak coupling duality examples studied in the last year have urged us to identify the soliton in the theory which becomes light at strong coupling",
    ". it will carry the fundamental degrees of freedom in the dual theory .    in conjecturing strong  weak coupling duality relations between string theories , we can test the conjecture by studying the properties of the candidate soliton string which will become light at strong coupling . as each of the string theories has very distinct signature properties , it is easy to see if the conjecture has a good chance of being right , if one has the tools to look for these properties@xcite .",
    "d  branes are the appropriate tools in many of these examples .      two examples of a conjectured string ",
    "string duality in ten dimensions are the self duality of the type iib string@xcite , and the duality relation between the @xmath4 string theories@xcite .",
    "the obvious candidate soliton string which will become light at strong coupling in each theory is the d1brane . as a soliton ,",
    "it is very heavy at weak string coupling .",
    "however , its mass is inversely proportional to the string coupling , a basic property of d ",
    "branes@xcite , and so it will become light at strong coupling .    in both cases it has to have the right properties to become the dual string in the strong coupling limit",
    ": one can use basic d  brane calculus to study their world  sheet properties .",
    "the excitations of a d  brane can be studied by examining the fundamental strings which end on the brane , defining its position and dynamics :    = 1.5 in    embedding such a macroscopic string in the background produces a decomposition of the spacetime lorentz group @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "( the factors refer to directions transverse and parallel to the world ",
    "volume , respectively . )",
    "the d1brane in the type iib theory has been shown to have right and left moving ( with respect to @xmath41 ) fermions on its world  sheet which are of the same chirality @xmath42 spinors : the massless fermionic content of a iib superstring@xcite .    meanwhile , after projecting with @xmath6 and adding d9branes to get the type i theory , the d1brane in that theory has only one @xmath42 spinor , coming from ( say ) the left , while the 1 - 9 and 9 - 1 fundamental strings produce a right  moving @xmath4 current algebra .",
    "this is the world sheet content of a heterotic string@xcite .",
    "another important application has been the demonstration that the bekenstein  hawking entropy / area law@xcite  of black hole thermodynamics can be derived as a truly statistical result .",
    "this was first done for five dimensional riessner ",
    "nordstrm black holes@xcite , and later shown for the four dimensional case@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is simple@xcite .",
    "the black holes of interest were embedded into ( say ) @xmath43 compactified type iib string theory as a bps state .",
    "the abelian ( maxwell ) fields they carry were embedded into the r - r sector of the compactified theory .",
    "the final embedding resembles a macroscopic string in six dimensions with a certain amount of r - r charge , together with a ns - ns charge representing momentum in one of the @xmath44 directions .",
    "so far this is just a black hole dressed up with a stringy embedding .",
    "the area of its horizon can be computed , as normal , and thus the entropy may be computed using the bekenstein  hawking law .",
    "we can also compute all of the r - r and ns - ns charges it carries using ordinary flux integrals .",
    "the important point comes when we try to evaluate the entropy as a statistical quantity .",
    "the internal structure of the black hole is a region we can only hope to probe with strong coupling string theory / quantum gravity .",
    "however , we can deform the theory to weak coupling ( as the black hole is a bps state of the string theory ) and compute the entropy there . at weak coupling ,",
    "the unique bps saturated object in the string theory with the same quantum numbers as the black hole we saw at strong coupling , is a bound state of certain types of d  branes .",
    "we can compute precisely how many d ",
    "branes are present in the composite due to the fact that we know the r - r charge of the composite , and the fact that d  branes carry the basic units of r - r charge@xcite .    the ns - ns charge corresponding to momentum is identified with the total momentum distributed among the fundamental strings connecting the constituent d  branes of the composite .",
    "evaluating the number of ways to distribute this quantum number amongst the bound state s constituents gives precisely the entropy .",
    "the basic orientifold example of the type i string can be extended to more complicated situations@xcite . developing the orientifold technology further",
    ", one can study a much larger class of string models than was previously possible with more traditional techniques .",
    "( the technology of constructing consistent string models in lower dimensions was largely limited to the closed string theories , as the unoriented and open string sectors were not as easily manipulated . )",
    "the orientifold group is simply the group of symmetries of the string theory which we might like to consider gauging , in a way anologous to what was carried out for @xmath6 in the ten dimensional example of section  3 .",
    "we consider discrete symmetries , which can be either purely of world ",
    "sheet ( @xmath6 ) or of spacetime ( like those used to form a conventional orbifold ) .",
    "perturbative consistency of the models obtained by gauging such a group of symmetries is ensured by@xcite :      in general , there will be tadpole cancellation associated with all the species of r - r @xmath26forms which can appear in the model , requiring the presence of a d@xmath19brane .",
    "tadpole cancellation is another way of seeing that the r - r @xmath26form s field equation is satisfied .",
