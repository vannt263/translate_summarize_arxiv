    "it is generally believed that galaxies are formed within the deep potential wells of the virialized dark matter ( dm ) halos and that clusters of galaxies are recently collapsed objects .",
    "the study of the physical properties of the dm halos in cosmological models therefore provides important clues to our understanding of the universe . in this letter , we report a fitting formula for the two - point correlation function @xmath11 of the dm halos in hierarchical clustering models .",
    "the accuracy of the fit is about @xmath12 in @xmath13 for a wide range of halo masses .",
    "the two - point correlation function of dm halos has been the subject of many recent attempts at analytical modelling ( e.g. cole & kaiser @xcite ; mann , heavens , & peacock @xcite ; mo & white @xcite , hereafter mw96 ; catelan et al .",

    "hh(r;m)=b^2(m)_mm(r ) .",
    "this should hold in the linearly clustering regime where the mass two - point correlation function @xmath14 is less than unity .",
    "the bias parameter @xmath15 is [ bias ] b(m ) = 1+^2 - 1_c=1+_c ^2(m)-1_c , where @xmath16 is the linearly evolved rms density fluctuation of top - hat spheres containing on average a mass @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( see mw96 and references therein for more details about these quantities ) . the parameter @xmath20 will be called the peak height for convenience .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were found in good agreement with their n - body results by mw96 and by mo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but their tests were limited to high mass halos with @xmath21 due to limited mass and force resolutions .",
    "the formula has been widely used : from modeling the correlation function of different types of galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "@xcite ; baugh et al .",
    "@xcite ) to interpreting the observed clustering of various extragalactic objects ( e.g. , mo et al .",

    ", we find that the linear bias ( eq .  [ linear ] ) is a good approximation in the linearly clustering regime , but the bias parameter given by eq.([bias ] ) agrees with the n - body results only for massive halos with mass @xmath23 , where @xmath3 is a characteristic non - linear mass scale defined by @xmath24 . for the less massive halos ,",
    "the n - body results imply significantly higher bias than the analytical prediction eq .",

    "one of the most interesting applications of the fitting formula would be the clustering of galaxies , since the local late type and dwarf galaxies are believed to have mass @xmath27 and to form recently ( redshift @xmath28 ; mo et al.@xcite ) while @xmath29 is expected for the present universe ( cf .",
    "the simulations will be described in section 2 , with emphasis on the aspects relevant to this letter . in section 3",
    ", we will present the correlation function of the halos and the fitting formula .",
    "the implications for theories and observations are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the two - point correlation functions of halos are studied both for scale - free models and for representative cdm models of hierarchical clustering . in the scale - free models ,",
    "a power - law power spectrum @xmath30 is used for the initial density fluctuation and the universe is assumed to be einstein  de sitter , @xmath31 .",
    "four models with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are studied .",
    "because these models are conceptually simple and exhibit interesting scaling properties , it is relatively easy to understand how physical properties depend on the shape of the power spectrum and , perhaps more importantly , to distinguish the physical effects from numerical artifacts , since the latter should not in general obey the scaling relations . for this reason",
    ", we will extensively use the scaling property that the bias parameter @xmath36 depends only on the halo mass @xmath17 scaled by @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath37 for each @xmath5 .",
    "this scaling property manifests itself when the bias parameter for @xmath37 is plotted for different evolution times .",
    "each of our simulations for @xmath38 is evolved for 1000 time steps with a total of seven outputs , and that for @xmath39 is evolved for 1362 steps with eight outputs .",
    "the output time interval is chosen so that @xmath3 at each successive output is increased by a factor 2.5 , and the @xmath3 values ( in units of the particle mass ) at the first output are 74 , 59 , 35 , and 13 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "note that fixing the @xmath3 values is equivalent to fixing the normalization for the power spectra .",
    "the time step and the integration variables are taken similarly to efstathiou et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in this letter",
    "we will rely on these scale - free models to understand how the halo - halo correlation depends on the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "then we will examine whether the result obtained from the scale - free models can be applied to cdm models , since cdm models , at least variants thereof , are believed to be close to reality .    three cdm models are very typical : one is the ( ever ) standard cdm model ( scdm ) , one is an open model with @xmath40 and with a vanishing cosmological constant @xmath41 ( ocdm ) , and the other is a flat lower density model with @xmath40 and @xmath42 ( lcdm ) .",
    "these cdm models are completely fixed with regard to the dm clustering if the initial density power spectrum is fixed . for our simulations , the linear cdm power spectrum of bardeen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the primordial harrison - zeldovich spectrum is used for the initial condition , which is fixed by the shape parameter @xmath43 and the amplitude @xmath44 ( the rms top - hat density fluctuation on radius @xmath45 ) .",
    "the values of ( @xmath46 , @xmath44 ) are ( 0.5 , 0.62 ) for scdm , ( 0.25 , 1 ) for ocdm , and ( 0.20 , 1 ) for lcdm .",
    "each model is simulated with our vectorized @xmath47 code on the fujitsu vpp300/16r supercomputer at the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "each simulation is performed with @xmath4 ( @xmath48 million ) particles and with good force resolution @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the simulation box size ) . to properly understand the effect of the cosmic variance ,",
    "three to four independent realizations are generated for each simulation of one model .",
    "furthermore , two different box sizes , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are adopted for each cdm model .",
    "further details about the code and the simulations will be given in a forthcoming paper ( jing , in preparation ) , where many clustering statistics of the dark matter will also be presented .",
    "the cdm simulations with box size @xmath51 were used by jing & suto ( @xcite ) to study the constraints on cosmological models of the high concentration of the lyman break galaxies at redshift @xmath53 discovered by steidel et al .",
    "the dm halos are identified with the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking parameter @xmath54 times the mean particle separation .",
    "the halos with at least 20 members are used for the clustering analysis .",
    "it is known that the mass defined by the members of such fof groups is very close to that defined by the spherical overdensity ( so ) virialization ( cole & lacey @xcite ) and that the mass function of such fof groups follows the predictions of the ps formalism ( e.g. lacey & cole @xcite ; mo et al .",
    "more importantly , the correlation function of dm halos is quite robust to reasonable halo identification methods , since , for example , the correlation function of the fof groups is statistically indistinguishable from that of the so groups ( mo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", it would suffice to use the fof groups for the present purpose .",
    "the first concern of this work is whether the bias of the halos is linear ( eq .  [ linear ] ) in the linearly clustering regime .",
    "we have calculated the ratio of @xmath11 to @xmath55 for every simulation output .",
    "some examples which are also typical are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , which show the ratio at two different outputs of the @xmath56 simulation for three different halo masses .",
    "the results are plotted only for the linear clustering regime i.e. @xmath57 , as only this regime is considered here .",
    "error bars are calculated by averaging over the different realizations .",
    "it is remarkable that the ratio is a constant within the @xmath58 error bars , i.e. the bias is linear and the bias parameter @xmath36 is a function of @xmath17 only .",
    "this statement is consistent with many previous studies , but is shown here with higher accuracy .",
    "since @xmath15 depends only on @xmath17 , we predict that for a scale - free model , if the mass @xmath17 is scaled by the characteristic mass @xmath3 , the bias parameter @xmath36 depends only on the scaled mass @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , by definitions of @xmath20 and @xmath3 , the scaled mass obeys a simple relation to the peak height @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath59 . thus it is also very convenient to compare the simulation data of @xmath60 with the formula of mw96 ( cf .",
    ".  [ bias ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the square of the bias parameter @xmath61 as a function of the scaled mass @xmath37 . the results for all simulation outputs are depicted .",
    "this is equivalent to a factor @xmath62 in the halo mass resolution .",
    "it is very remarkable that the @xmath63 results agree very well for different evolutionary outputs .",
    "the precise scaling behaviour given by the simulation data assures that any numerical artifacts have negligible effect on the results of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "now we compare our simulation results with the prediction of mw96 .",
    "the mw96 predictions are drawn on fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) in dotted lines .",
    "it is interesting to see that the mw96 formula agrees well ( within @xmath64 uncertainty ) with the simulation results for massive halos , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "however , at @xmath66 the simulation data start to deviate from the mw96 prediction , and the deviation increases with the decrease of the scaled mass ( or equivalently with the decrease of the peak height ) . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the simulation result is about 2 to 4 times higher than the prediction . considering the important role played by the correlation functions of the halos in the cosmological studies , we have searched for a fitting formula for @xmath60 .",
    "the formula [ fitting ] b(m)=(0.5 ^ 4 + 1)^(0.06 - 0.02n ) ( 1+^2 - 1_c ) ; = ( m / m_)^n+3/6 can fit the simulation results ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with an accuracy of about 5% for the halo mass that the simulations can probe , i.e. @xmath68 for @xmath32 ; @xmath69 for @xmath70 ; @xmath71 for @xmath72 ; @xmath73 for @xmath39 .",
    "the fitting formula recovers the mw96 analytical formula ( eq .",
    "[ bias ] ) at high mass @xmath74 .",
    "the deviation of the mw96 prediction from the simulation results at small mass is accounted for by the factor @xmath75 .",
    "since the scale - free models are only approximations to the real universe at some specific scales , it is very important to consider more realistic models . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present the @xmath76 for the halos in the three cdm models .",
    "the blue squares are determined from the simulations of box size @xmath52 and the red triangles are from those of the smaller boxes . in consistency with the scale - free models , the simulation data are significantly higher than the mw96 prediction ( the dotted lines ) for masses less than @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is about @xmath77 for the scdm and about @xmath78 for the low density models . since the slopes of the cdm power spectra change with scale , the fitting formula  ( [ fitting ] )",
    "is not directly applicable .",
    "fortunately , the fitting formula depends very weakly on the power index @xmath5 , and it can describe the cdm data very accurately if an effective index @xmath6 replaces @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ fitting ] ) and the original definition of @xmath79 is used for @xmath20 .",
    "the effective index is defined as the slope of @xmath80 at the halo mass @xmath17 [ neff ] n_eff = d p(k ) d k|_k=2r ; 1.5 cm r=(3m4|)^1/3 , where @xmath81 is the mean density of the universe .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) are predicted in this way .",
    "they agree very well with the simulation results .",
    "the fact that @xmath6 changes very slowly with the mass m for @xmath82 might be the main reason why the fitting formula can work very well for cdm models after the simple modification .",
    "we have determined the correlation function of the dm halos for the hitherto largest set of high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "the excellent scaling exhibited in the bias parameter @xmath60 at the different evolutionary outputs for the scale - free models assures that the results in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are physical , not contaminated by numerical artifacts .",
    "the simulation results are in good agreement with the formula of mo & white ( 1996 ) for massive halos @xmath23 . however , for less massive halos the simulation results are significantly higher .",
    "the mw96 formula was found in good agreement with the results of @xmath83-particle scale - free simulations by mw96 and with the results of @xmath84-particle cdm simulations of box size @xmath85 by mo et al.(1996 ) .",
    "however , their tests were limited to halos with @xmath23 because of the relatively poorer mass resolutions .",
    "the results found here therefore do not contradict with , but in fact support and extend the previous n - body tests .    the fitting formula ( [ fitting ] ) we found for @xmath15 is accurate for halo masses @xmath86 with only about 5% error . the formula can be applied both to the scale - free models and to the cdm models . in the latter case , the index @xmath5 in equation ( [ fitting ] ) should be replaced with the effective power spectrum index @xmath6 ( eq .  [ neff ] ) and the original definition of @xmath79 is used for @xmath20 .",
    "this fitting formula could have many important applications for the studies of the large - scale structures .",
    "one of them would be to predict and to interpret the clustering of late type galaxies and dwarf galaxies both in real observations and in analytical modeling of galaxy formation , since these galaxies are believed to have formed recently ( @xmath28 ; cf mo et al .",
    "@xcite ) with halo masses much less than @xmath3 .    at present",
    "we do not know the _",
    "exact _ reasons which cause the mw96 formula to fail at the small halo masses @xmath87 . in the derivation of mw96 ,",
    "two main assumptions are 1 ) the halo formation is determined by the peak height through the extended press - schechter formalism ; 2 ) the mapping of the halo clustering pattern from the lagrangian space to the eulerian one is local and linear ( with the spherical collapse model ) .",
    "the first assumption could break down more seriously for low peak - height halos , because the tidal force plays a more important role in their formation .",
    "though , as katz , quinn & gelb ( @xcite ; see also katz et al .",
    "@xcite ) pointed out , the peak - height is not the sole parameter even for the formation of high - peak halos .",
    "the validity of the local linear mapping was recently questioned by catelan et al.(@xcite ) in a different context .",
    "unfortunately their result is not directly applicable to this letter . in relation to the gentle rise observed for the bias parameter at the small @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , we have visually inspected the spatial distribution for halos with @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) in one late output of the @xmath32 model .",
    "the small and large halos appear to delineate filamentary structures more closely than the median - mass halos , consistent with the measured @xmath36 .",
    "this however might hint that either or both of the two assumptions are violated for the small halos , since the small halos are otherwise expected to be more preferentially located in low density regions",
    ". obviously it would be very interesting to find out why the mw96 formula fails . in a future paper",
    ", we will examine this question more closely .",
    "i am indebted to gerhard brner and yasushi suto for their critical reading of earlier versions of the manuscript .",
    "constructive comments by them , by houjun mo , and by an anonymous referee improve the presentation of this letter .",
    "yasushi suto is thanked for his invaluable assistance and continuing encouragement ; it would be impossible to get these very large , high quality simulations without his help .",
