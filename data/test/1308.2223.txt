    "from the sizes of protoplanetary disks , we expect planets to form out to tens of au .",
    "the many giant planets found on small orbits by radial velocity and transit techniques are believed to have formed beyond the water ice lines of their stars and migrated inward .",
    "inward migration of massive planets can have a profound ( and usually destructive ) effect on the smaller objects in a planetary system , such as earth - sized planets within the habitable zones .",
    "it is therefore important to determine how many systems retain their giant planets on wide orbits .",
    "direct detection of these planets is limited to the most massive examples .",
    "indirect detection through the use of debris disks addresses this limitation .",
    "a debris disk consists of the circumstellar solid material that remains after the protoplanetary disk gas has dispersed and giant planets might have formed .",
    "although most of the mass in a debris disk is harbored by the parent bodies ( planetesimals ) , dust generated in their collisions accounts for the majority of the disk s surface area , and observations of debris disks via their thermal emission or reflected stellar radiation trace this dust .",
    "while tens of debris disks have been spatially resolved , the majority are detected only as an infrared excess in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of their star .",
    "typical debris disk temperatures are tens to a few hundred kelvins , emitting as modified blackbodies that peak in the mid to far infrared .",
    "these wavelengths are well - suited for study with the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite infrared spectrograph ( irs ;",
    "@xcite ) and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; @xcite ) . for a recent review of debris disks ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "debris disks often appear constrained to one or two discrete rings .",
    "this is evident from images of resolved disks such as fomalhaut @xcite , and from seds of unresolved debris disks that are fit well by one or two blackbody functions , corresponding to dust at one or two distinct radial locations .",
    "of the 28 disks without strong emission features presented by @xcite , all but one were fit better with a blackbody function than with a continuous disk model .",
    "the exception was hr8799 , which was later determined to be best modelled by two blackbodies @xcite .",
    "@xcite originally fit some excess seds with a power law , representing a continuous radial distribution of dust ; however , @xcite argued that these power law fits require the optical depth of the disk to increase with orbital radius ( which is theoretically implausible ) , and they found that these targets can be fit well by two blackbodies instead . these  warm \" and  cold \" debris disk components may be analogous to the asteroid belt and kuiper belt in the solar system .",
    "why do rings form , and what sets their location ?",
    "ice lines are one possibility . during the protoplanetary disk phase , a radial pressure gradient in the gas",
    "partially counteracts the gravitational force on the gas , allowing it to rotate at a sub - keplerian velocity .",
    "solid particles orbit at keplerian rates , and thus experience a head wind that slows their rotation and makes them spiral inwards . when these solids reach the ice line , the volatile component sublimates , producing a local pressure increase that counteracts the overall pressure gradient .",
    "this creates a zone where the particles can settle without a headwind .",
    "thus , there is a tendency to have a planetesimal belt near the ice line , and this belt can then produce grains that assume a specific temperature .",
    "@xcite found similar warm disk temperatures ( 190 k ) around stars of different stellar types .",
    "this can potentially be explained by the presence of the water ice line at 150 - 170 k. @xcite argue that ice lines of other species ( e.g. co , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) at lower temperatures may play an important role in planet formation in the outer solar system .",
    "if ice lines are also responsible for setting the location of the cold components , we would expect these components to have similar temperatures over a range of stellar types .",
    "planets may also cause the discrete ring structures .",
    "planetesimals will be scattered away once a planet is massive enough to dominate the gravity in its vicinity .",
    "observations support the expected relation between planets and disk structure : the four giant planets imaged around hr 8799 @xcite are located in the gap between the warm and cold debris disk components @xcite ; the imaged planet orbiting @xmath2 pic appears to sculpt the inner edge of its debris disk @xcite ; the well - resolved cold debris ring around fomalhaut is likely confined by planets @xcite ; and in the solar system , neptune sculpts the inner edge of the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "if the locations of debris disks are set by planets , we can use cold debris disks to investigate wide - orbit planets , which are not easily studied by other means .",
    "of the over 850 confirmed exoplanets , 35 have orbits larger than 5 au , and only 17 have orbits larger than 10 au ( nasa exoplanet archive ) .",
    "this is likely due to the observational biases of the radial velocity and transit detection techniques .",
    "direct imaging can detect wide - orbit planets , but the current technology is only sensitive to very massive planets around young , nearby stars .",
    "uranus and neptune , for instance , could not be directly detected from outside the solar system .",
    "the planet formation processes beyond 5 - 10 au are poorly understood .",
    "for example , did the planets around hr 8799 form at their current locations or did they ( or at least their cores ) form on smaller orbits , then migrate outwards via scattering interactions with other planets or planetesimals ?",
    "cold debris disks provide an observational test of these planet formation and migration theories .",
    "planet formation by core accretion becomes less efficient farther from the star due to a radial increase in the dynamical timescale and decline in the surface density of solids in the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , the inner edge of a cold debris disk may represent the outer limit of efficient core accretion @xcite .",
    "a planet migrating outwards into a debris disk will push the inner edge of the disk outward as well .",
    "uranus and neptune may have formed on smaller orbits and migrated into the kuiper belt @xcite . in this alternate scenario ,",
    "the inner edge of a cold debris disk may represent the limits of outward migration .",
    "in this paper , we focus on _ spitzer _ measurements of cold debris disks , showing how their temperatures vary with the temperature of their central star and what this implies about planet formation and migration on wide - orbits .",
    "first , we describe the selection of our target stars (  [ sec : targetselection ] ) .",
    "then , we outline our photometric (  [ sec : photometry ] ) and irs (  [ sec : irsdatareduction ] ) data acquisition / reduction .",
    "next , we detail our modeling of the stellar photosphere sed (  [ sec : photospheremodel ] ) , our derivation of the infrared excess , and our fitting of blackbodies to the excess (  [ sec : blackbodyfitting ] ) .",
    "finally , we analyze the results (  [ sec : results ] ) and discuss the implications for wide - orbit planet formation and migration (  [ sec : discussion ] ) , before offering a summary and concluding remarks (  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "we searched the _ spitzer _ observers log for main - sequence stars that were observed with the irs long low ( ll ) module ( both orders ) in staring mode and with mips at 24 @xmath3 and 70 @xmath3 , and we accumulated a sample of 546 targets .",
    "the stellar properties of our target list are summarized in table [ table : stellarproperties ] . after reducing and analyzing the data , we refined the sample as described in ",
    "[ sec : blackbodyfitting ] .",
    "this yielded 225 stars with significant excess ( of which 174 had cold components ) , which are detailed in table [ table : excessdata ] .",
    "it is important to note that our sample comprised stars from a variety of _ spitzer _ observational programs , each having targets selected in a different manner ( e.g. nearby stars , stars with previously detected infrared excess , stars with rv - detected planets , etc . ) .",
    "hence , our sample was not selected to be statistically representative in any one sense ; rather , it was designed to include as many relevant targets as possible .",
    "we calculated the stellar temperature , @xmath4 , from the star s v-@xmath5 color using tabulated values for main - sequence stars ( or interpolations between these values ) from @xcite , and we estimated a 200 k one - sigma uncertainty on these values .",
    "@xmath4 is listed for targets with significant excess in table [ table : excessdata ] . over the range of spectral types and metallicities of our sample of stars ,",
    "v-@xmath5 is an accurate indicator of stellar effective temperature , with a peak - to - peak scatter of less than @xmath6 1.5% and weak metallicity dependence @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath4 to parametrize stellar type , and this degree of accuracy is sufficient for our purpose . some of the uncertainty in @xmath4 reflects the effect of interstellar reddening on v-@xmath5 , although the great majority of stars in this sample are within the local bubble and therefore should not be strongly reddened ( of the 174 targets for which we detect cold components , only 29 are beyond 100 pc , 19 are beyond 120 pc , and 4 are beyond 150 pc )",
    ".    ages for these stars were estimated from a combination of chromospheric activity measurements , x - ray emission , placement on the hr diagram , surface gravity , membership in clusters and associations , and gyrochronology collected from the literature .",
    "@xcite describe the intercomparison of these methods and how they are applied , and the quoted ages are on the scale calibrated by @xcite .",
    "the ages are listed in table [ table : stellarproperties ] , along with references for the measurements used to derive the ages and a quality flag for the age accuracy ( ranging from 0 if no age could be determined to 3 if there were three or more age measurements with good agreement ) .",

    "systematic offsets in flux existed between irs orders , which we fixed by applying a multiplicative correction factor to the ll first order spectrum and to both sl order spectra ( if they existed ) , in order to align them with the ll second order flux .",
    "initially , we determined the order correction factors using an automated routine , but due to the variety of shapes of the spectra and the presence of outlying data points , we found that fine - tuning these factors by eye was more reliable .",
    "the data from all available orders and modules were then combined into a single spectrum .",
    "next , we cut outlying data points from the spectrum in an iterative process .",
    "the spectrum was fit with a polynomial and the standard deviation of residual flux values around the fit was calculated .",
    "points lying more than three standard deviations from the fit were discarded .",
    "this process was iterated six times .",
    "because the scatter of the data generally increased towards longer wavelengths , we applied this process separately to the short and long ends of our spectrum ; if sl data were available , the two sections were divided at 14 @xmath3 and each section fit with a fourth degree polynomial , whereas if no sl data were available , the sections were divided at 25 @xmath3 and each section was fit with a second degree polynomial .",
    "this procedure , on average , cut 10 data points from each spectrum , with the first iteration typically cutting five points , and the sixth iteration only cutting zero , one , or two points ( nearly 90% of spectra had no points cut in the sixth iteration ) . before cutting ,",
    "the spectra had 181 , 296 , or 373 points , depending on the available orders .",
    "after the outliers were cut , the spectrum was smoothed by binning to a wavelength resolution of 0.7 @xmath3 .",
    "the absolute calibration of irs data is only accurate to @xmath910% , whereas the mips calibration is accurate to @xmath92% @xcite . to reduce systematic errors in our irs data",
    ", we multiplicatively scaled our spectrum to be consistent with the measured mips 24 @xmath3 flux density for each target .",
    "the irs spectra were calibrated as point sources , so if a source was slightly extended , it would have an incorrect slit - loss correction .",
    "the stellar photospheres ( point - like ) are dominant in the irs spectra for the majority of sources in the sample ; therefore , this has no significant impact on the result .",
    "if the mips photometry for a source was contaminated by background emission , this contamination would be passed to the irs spectrum of the source through this scaling ( the irs data may or may not have picked up the contamination , depending on the slit orientation ) .",
    "nevertheless , an additional multiplicative factor was later applied to the irs data ( see  [ sec : photospheremodel ] ) , which corrected any lingering errors from this process .",
    "some targets were observed with more than one irs aor .",
    "we combined the spectra from these aors , interleaving their data points , then re - smoothing to a spectral resolution of 0.7 @xmath3 .",
    "although the spectrum of a main - sequence star peaks in the visible or near - ir , the stellar photosphere can still be the dominant source of flux density in the mid - ir .",
    "thus , to extract the thermal emission of the debris disk ( the infrared excess ) , an accurate model spectrum of the stellar photosphere must be generated and subtracted from the data .",
    "it is common to use photosphere spectra from detailed numerical models of stellar structures , such as kurucz / atlas9 @xcite .",
    "however , these models are not well - tested in the mid- and far - infrared .",
    "@xcite compared various families of models ( kurucz / atlas9 , marcs , and nextgen / phoenix ) and found that the choice of model family can affect whether a star is determined to have an infrared excess or not .",
    "we opted for a simpler model , a rayleigh - jeans relation given by @xmath10 , where rj is an amplitude scale factor .",
    "this model is appropriate for wavelengths beyond 5 @xmath11 m because stars in this study , mostly a through k dwarfs , have virtually no spectral features in the mid - ir , behaving as blackbodies in the rayleigh - jeans regime . for example , in the range of most interest for this study , the departure of a reference a0 star spectrum @xcite from a rayleigh - jeans fit between 15 and 30 @xmath3 is no more than @xmath6 0.3% , and the atlas9 @xcite solar model follows rayleigh - jeans behavior to within @xmath6 0.24% from 20 to 40 @xmath3 .",
    "however , the theoretical spectra show minor systematic differences from the observations @xcite , so use of them to improve the knowledge of the seds would be risky .    modeling",
    "the photosphere thus came down to finding the appropriate scale factor ( rj ) for each star in our sample .",
    "we used a set of color relations ( derived from a sample of stars known to have no ir excess ) to predict the mips 24 @xmath3 magnitude of the photosphere , [ 24 ] , from measured v , j , h , @xmath5 , and irac magnitudes ",
    "bands where ir excesses due to very close - in dust are very rare .",
    "the details of these relations are described in the appendix .",
    "this procedure estimates the 24 @xmath11 m photospheric outputs to about 2% rms , based solely on data at wavelengths short of 4 @xmath11 m .",
    "we then converted [ 24 ] to flux density units and used it to find the scaling factor for the photosphere model , which is given in table [ table : excessdata ] for targets with significant excess ( see  [ sec : blackbodyfitting ] ) .",
    "we finally applied a small multiplicative factor to the irs data if it clearly looked slightly offset from the photosphere model .",

    "second , for the remaining targets , we identified those for which the presence of the cold component relied entirely on the mips 70 @xmath3 point , meaning the irs excess was entirely fit by the warm component .",
    "for these targets to have significant cold components , we required their mips 70 @xmath3 excess to fall more than 3@xmath8 above the excess predicted by the warm component .",
    "that is , if one of these targets had @xmath38 we concluded that it was best fit by one component .",
    "this step was analogous to the third step we performed when deciding if each target had excess or not .",
    "the targets that passed both of these criteria were deemed to have two components .",
    "this process identified 100 single - component cold disks , 51 single - component warm disks , and 74 two - component disks .",
    "we found only one target ( hip45585 ) that required two warm components ( both @xmath39130 k ) to fit properly , and we discarded this target from our results as it had no cold components ( it is counted in the 321 targets that we discarded ) .",
    "we found no targets requiring two components colder than 100 k. our methods were insensitive to possible additional cold components below @xmath950 k. we concluded that our fitting procedure allowed us to find all cold components above this limit .",
    "equivalently , our method reliably fit the inner edges of the cold disks .",
    "for the two - component disks , we calculated the fractional excesses for the warm and cold components , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , using equation [ eq : fwyatt2 ] .",
    "one - component excesses were deemed warm or cold depending if they had temperatures above or below 130 k. the verdicts for all targets are given in table [ table : stellarproperties ] and the parameters of our best fits for targets with significantly - detected components are listed in table [ table : excessdata ] .",
    "we estimated that the uncertainty in @xmath33 was 10 k. this estimate was conservative ; warmer cold components had more irs data points in excess of the photosphere , so their fits were more constrained , with a temperature uncertainty of 3 to 7 k.    we were unable to accurately constrain the temperatures of very cold components , which were detected only at 70 @xmath11 m . with only one data point , blackbodies at a wide range of cold temperatures could be given the amplitude necessary to match the point , so a degeneracy existed between t and @xmath22 in blackbody fits to the excess sed .",
    "we made this distinction at 45 k ; above this temperature there was enough information in the irs spectra to constrain the temperature .",
    "cold temperatures above 45 k were considered true detections , while cold temperatures below 45 k were considered unconstrained and were replaced with upper limits at 45 k. by using the 70 @xmath3 data to determine if such targets had significant excesses , we ensured that these disks were truly very cold , rather than warm but very faint .",
    "of the 174 cold components in our sample , 25 had temperature upper limits .",
    "some irs spectra exhibit mineralogical emission features ( e.g. hip41081 , hip57971 ) .",
    "our model did not explicitly account for these features , but they peak sharply at @xmath910 @xmath3 and do not resemble blackbody functions .",
    "these features did not influence our fits , except to raise the value of the minimum reduced chi - squared .",
    "the data and best fits for a small sample of our targets are shown in figures [ fig : twocompgallery ] , [ fig : coldcompgallery ] , and [ fig : warmcompgallery ] ( for targets with two components , one cold component , and one warm component , respectively ) .",
    "the left panels in all of these figures show the measured data with the photosphere and blackbody models , while the right panels illustrate the excess data and models with the photosphere subtracted .",

    "45 k around cooler stars .",
    "the green line is the best fit trend to the data , determined by a bayesian linear regression , @xmath42 .",
    "a representative error bar is in the lower right . ]",
    "@xcite studied the behavior of the warm disk components in detail , but their sample ( restricted to stars with ages less than 1 gyr ) had too few 70 @xmath3 detections of solar - type stars ( 9 ) to determine any trends between the cold component temperature and stellar type .",
    "to look for such a trend in our larger sample , we plot the cold component temperature versus stellar temperature in figure [ fig : tdisktstarscatter ] .",
    "well - constrained disk temperatures are black circles ( open circles are young systems with age less than 25 myr ) , and upper limits are downward facing blue triangles .",
    "although there is substantial scatter in the cold component temperatures , a positive correlation between cold debris disk temperature and stellar temperature is evident .    to quantify this trend ,",
    "we fit a linear relation to the data by bayesian analysis using the routine linmix_err .",
    "the routine properly handles upper - limits , and it uses uncertainties in both x and y directions ( we assumed an uncertainty of 10 k in @xmath33 and 200 k in @xmath4 ) . in its model , the routine also includes the normally - distributed intrinsic scatter of the data around the trend .",
    "the posterior distributions of the slope , intercept , and intrinsic scatter from the bayesian regression are show in figure [ fig : trendposteriors ] .",
    "the slope of the linear regression was @xmath43 , thus the existence of a trend between @xmath33 and @xmath4 is significant at level greater than 4.5@xmath8 .",
    "the 1@xmath8 intrinsic scatter around the trend was @xmath44 k. the best - fit trend line from the bayesian analysis , @xmath42 , is plotted in green in figure [ fig : tdisktstarscatter ] . the choice of a linear fit is not physically motivated ; its purpose is to show that  to first order  there is a correlation between cold debris disk temperature and stellar type .    a significant source of scatter around the trend results from the 10 targets with @xmath45 k and @xmath46 k. six of these stars ( hip560 , hip64184 , hip64995 , hip65875 , hip67497 , and hip78663 ) are less than 25 myr old ( most are part of the scorpius - centaurus association ) .",
    "although we show in  [ sec : discussion ] that there is no significant trend in @xmath33 with age across the broad range of stellar ages in our sample , the excesses of these targets may be a product of their relatively young ages .",
    "they represent a period ( 5 - 50 myr ) when considerable collisional activity may still be occurring as a result of planet building @xcite .     vs. @xmath4 trend slope ,",
    "intercept , and intrinsic scatter , generated by the linmix_err routine . ]",
    "we now consider what determines the temperature of cold debris disks and how a trend with stellar type might arise .    as discussed in  1 , @xcite found similar warm disk temperatures ( 190 k ) around stars of different stellar types , and they attributed the effect to a particle trap at the water ice line .",
    "if ice lines of other species set the location of cold debris disks , we would expect cold disks around different type stars to have a common temperature .",
    "however , the trend of cold component temperature with stellar type ( figure [ fig : tdisktstarscatter ] ) is inconsistent with any strictly temperature - dependent mechanism for setting the location of cold debris disks .",
    "@xcite show that during the protoplanetary disk phase , the water ice line location is time dependent , and predicting it requires accounting for viscous heating in the disk , as well as the evolution of the pre - main - sequence stellar luminosity .",
    "such considerations have not been applied to potential ice lines of species other than water , and we do not consider this level of detail here",
    ".    delayed stirring , in which the radial location of dust in a debris disk moves outwards with time , is a postulated mechanism for debris disk evolution @xcite .",
    "this could occur if the parent bodies are distributed in a broad ring .",
    "particles in a debris disk collide and grind into dust faster on smaller orbits where the dynamical timescale is shorter .",
    "thus , the location of the emitting dust moves outward with time , and , therefore , becomes cooler with time . because late type stars have longer lifetimes than early type stars , the late type stars in our sample are generally older than the early type stars .",
    "if delayed stirring occurs , then this age bias in our sample could explain the observed trend in @xmath33 with @xmath4 . to test this hypothesis , we plot @xmath33 against the age of the system ( if available ) for targets in three @xmath4 bins ( 5000 to 6000 k , 6000 to 7000 k , and 7500 to 9500 k ) , shown in figure [ fig : agevstdisk ] .",
    "we see no trend in @xmath33 with age in any bin , suggesting that delayed stirring does not produce the trend of disk temperature with stellar type .",
    "is plotted against the age of the system for targets in three @xmath4 bins .",
    "no trend is seen with age , suggesting age does not play a confounding role in our discovered @xmath33 vs. @xmath4 trend .",
    "this also argues against the occurrence of delayed stirring . ]",
    "perhaps cold debris disks are all at roughly the same orbital distance , regardless of stellar type . assuming the disk is heated to its equilibrium temperature , the relation between the disk s temperature , location , and stellar type is given by @xmath47 the second and third lines of equation [ eq : equilibriumtemp ] are derived assuming @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( valid in the roughly solar mass range ) .",
    "so with @xmath50 constant , early type stars would host warmer disks .",
    "@xcite perform detailed simulations of the evolution of debris disks with inner and outer edges at 30 and 150 au , respectively , around stars with mass ranging from 1 to 3 @xmath51 .",
    "their models output the disk emission at 24 and 70 @xmath3 , which show that the ( color ) temperature of these cold debris disks does increase with stellar mass , in agreement with this expectation .",
    "but is the orbital location of cold debris disks truly constant with stellar type ? if the size of cold debris disks traces the size of the original protoplanetary disks , we can use observations of the latter to address this question .",
    "@xcite find that protoplanetary disk mass and radius are related by @xmath52 furthermore , observations @xcite show that @xmath53 combining these relations yields @xmath54 so protoplanetary disk size does increase with earlier stellar type , albeit slowly .",
    "how quickly must the disk size increase for it to maintain a constant temperature ? from equation [ eq : equilibriumtemp ] , @xmath55 although the size of disks does increase with earlier spectral type , it does so more slowly than required to maintain a constant temperature , thus disks are expected to be warmer around early type stars , consistent with our findings . substituting equation [ eq : ppradius ] into equation [ eq : equilibriumtemp ]",
    "reveals how the disk temperature would vary with spectral type in this case : @xmath56 new results from @xcite suggest that equation [ eq : ppandstarmass ] may hold only for @xmath57 , with disk mass constant or possibly even decreasing as @xmath58 for higher mass stars .",
    "if this were true and translated into a flat or decreasing @xmath50 with @xmath59 , then the disk temperature would increase even faster with spectral type than derived in equation [ eq : migresult ] .",
    "is it plausible that the inner edge of cold debris disks scales with the size of the original protoplanetary disk ?",
    "some mechanism must clear the material inside cold debris disks and set their inner edge , and planets are a common explanation .",
    "an outwardly migrating planet would set an inner edge , but migration from planet - planet scattering can be a chaotic and unpredictable phenomenon ; simulations show that the planet s final location depends sensitively on the initial conditions of the system @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a trend with stellar temperature would not arise .",
    "outward migration via scattering through a smooth disk of planetesimals would proceed in a more orderly manner , and the planet would halt its migration when the surface density of planetesimals decreased below a certain threshold , at a location that scales with the size of the original protoplanetary disk .",
    "planet formation by core accretion ( without migration ) would also clear debris inside the cold component and create its inner edge .",
    "planetesimals would be either incorporated into the planets as they formed , or scattered away once the planets became massive enough to dominate the gravitational field in their vicinity . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , core accretion efficiency declines with increasing orbital radius , leaving an outer zone of planetesimals beyond the planets . the timescale for the formation of a planet with a given mass scales as @xmath60 where p is the orbital period and @xmath61 is the surface density of solids . substituting kepler s third law , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the orbital distance ) and the typical protoplanetary disk structure , @xmath64 @xcite into equation [ eq : formationtime ] gives @xmath65 after a time ( @xmath66 ) planets will have formed out to a given orbital location ( @xmath63 ) , which sets the inner edge of the cold debris disk .",
    "so setting @xmath66 constant and @xmath67 predicts that the size of the disk would scale with spectral type as @xmath68 by comparing this with equation [ eq : equilibriumradius ] , we see that in this case as well , the size of the disk grows more slowly with stellar type than required to maintain a constant equilibrium temperature , consistent with our observational results .",
    "substituting equation [ eq : formradius ] into equation [ eq : equilibriumtemp ] shows how the disk temperature would vary with stellar type if its inner edge were set by the limits of planet formation : @xmath69",
    "we studied the circumstellar environment of 546 main - sequence stars via the mid infrared emission of their debris disks , as measured by the _ spitzer _ space telescope . after subtracting a model of the flux expected from the stellar photosphere",
    ", we obtained an sed of the infrared excess for each target .",
    "we found 225 targets with significant excess : 100 with a single cold component , 51 with a single warm component , and 74 with two components . examining the results revealed a trend between the temperature of the inner edge of the cold debris disk component and that of its host star .",
    "photosphere magnitude for a sample of 1037 stars .",
    "the blue curve shows the gaussian fit to the distribution with @xmath70 and @xmath71 . ]",
    "this trend is inconsistent with theories that predict the location of cold debris disks to be strictly temperature - dependent , i.e. we rule out the dominance of ice lines in sculpting the outer regions of planetary systems .",
    "we also rule out delayed stirring as the source of this trend .",
    "the trend can potentially be explained if the outward migration of planets traces the extent of the primordial protoplanetary disk , which tends to be limited to warmer equilibrium temperatures for hotter stars .",
    "the trend can also be explained if planets form in situ out to a distance where the core accretion efficiency drops below a certain threshold , leaving a cold debris disk that is warmer around earlier type stars .",
