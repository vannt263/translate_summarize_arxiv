    "the study of the velocity gradient tensor in fully developed turbulence has lead to interesting findings and has contributed to improved understanding of many statistical and geometrical properties of turbulent flows . in particular , recent progress has been made in the study of the lagrangian dynamics and modeling of the velocity gradient tensor ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview of the subject ) .",
    "this tensor is given by @xmath1 , where * u * is the velocity vector .",
    "taking a spatial gradient of the navier - stokes equations , the following transport equation for * a * is obtained : @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for the lagrangian time derivative , @xmath4 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath5 is the pressure hessian .",
    "the first term @xmath6 is the self - stretching term .",
    "the restricted euler ( re ) approximation , which assumes an isotropic pressure hessian @xmath7 and neglects viscous effects , leads to an autonomous set of coupled ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic dynamics of the re system leads to a finite time divergence of the components of * a * during which the vorticity @xmath8 gets aligned with the eigenvector of the rate of strain , @xmath9 , associated with the intermediate eigenvalue , as often observed in real turbulence @xcite . to prevent the development of unphysical finite time singularities , both the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian and the viscous diffusion term have to be modeled",
    "this was the subject of former works @xcite .",
    "in particular , closures were proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 and @xmath11 in terms of the local value of * a*. the local closures of ref .",
    "@xcite , when inserted into the dynamics generated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsa ] ) under the action of a stochastic forcing term , lead to stationary statistics of * a * along lagrangian trajectories which compare well with those obtained from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equations at moderate reynolds numbers @xcite . at higher reynolds numbers , predictions of the stochastic model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite turn out to become unrealistic , mainly because of the weakness of the closure for the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian .",
    "indeed , the pressure hessian is related to the spatial distribution of the velocity gradient using singular integral operators @xcite according to : @xmath12 above , the integral is understood as a cauchy principal value ( p.v . ) and @xmath13 is the hessian of the green s function for the laplacian operator , namely @xmath14 one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : soph ] ) that only the isotropic part of the pressure hessian is purely local ( the first term on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : soph ] ) ) .",
    "all the nonlocal effects of pressure hessian enter through the anisotropic part ( or deviatoric part corresponding to the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : soph ] ) ) .",
    "hence , in this view , the re approximation can be understood as the neglect of all the nonlocal effects implied by the incompressibility condition ( or pressure field ) .    in order to quantify the precise action of pressure in numerical turbulent flows , it was proposed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , to study the probability current associated with pressure in the plane spanned by the two highly relevant invariants of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath0 ( the so - called @xmath17-plane ) .",
    "one of these invariants , defined as , @xmath18 quantifies the net balance , or competition , between enstrophy and dissipation .",
    "the other important invariant , defined as @xmath19 quantifies the competition between enstrophy production and strain skewness ( i.e. dissipation production ) . as it will be recalled in the following , in terms of the velocity gradient evolution in statistically stationary turbulence , pressure has two important roles .",
    "first of all , pressure counteracts the development of the singularity implied by the self - stretching term .",
    "this feature is found to be well reproduced by existing closures @xcite .",
    "the other important pressure action is the redistribution of probabilities towards enstrophy production dominated regions ( i.e. towards @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is not reproduced well by existing closures . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , a related deficiency of the closures is that they all predict that the pressure hessian is proportional to @xmath0 . in the @xmath21 plane dynamics",
    ", this implies that when @xmath22 , the effect of pressure hessian also vanishes . for real turbulence",
    ", there is no such vanishing of pressure hessian effects when @xmath22 @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we investigate whether these particular features of pressure ( redistribution of probabilities towards enstrophy production , and non - vanishing action even when @xmath22 ) is inherent to true navier - stokes turbulence , or can also be observed in various approximations , namely synthetic turbulent velocity fields .",
    "various types of synthetic fields are considered .",
    "the first type of synthetic field considered is gaussian fields obtained by superposing random - phase fourier modes with prescribed spectra .",
    "the second type is called ` multifractal ' @xcite , and consists of a gaussian field whose vorticity field is amplified by means of the ` fluid deformation closure ' and made consistent with multifractality s long - range correlations in physical space @xcite .",
    "the third type of synthetic field is generated using the lagrangian mapping technique @xcite .",
    "it also relies on random - phase gaussian fields but then applies a multi - scale deformation of fluid particles using a simple lagrangian mapping . for each of these synthetic velocity fields ,",
    "a pressure field is obtained numerically by means of the pressure poisson equation . as will be seen , unlike the local closures discussed above ,",
    "these synthetic fields reproduce many correct features of the pressure hessian .",
    "in particular , they will be shown to reproduce the redistribution of probability towards enstrophy production , as well as displaying non - vanishing action , even when @xmath22 .    the second part of the paper studies to what degree spatial locality is important in determining these properties of the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian . as can be seen from the expression for the pressure hessian ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : soph ] ) ) , the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian is also the part that is spatially nonlocal , i.e. the part that requires knowledge of @xmath23 at positions @xmath24 .",
    "arguably , the more non - local effects are important , the more challenging it is to formulate closures in terms of local quantities . in order to examine the degree of locality , in the second part of this paper",
    "we decompose the space integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soph ] ) into two parts , a local part given by the integration over a small ball of radius given by the kolmogorov length scale @xmath25 , and the remainder being the ` nonlocal ' portion .",
    "we will show that neglecting the second non - local contribution leads to an expression that models the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian in terms of the hessian of the invariant @xmath0 . using dns data ,",
    "this expression is compared with the true pressure hessian .",
    "we follow the approach used in refs .",
    "@xcite , based on a fokker - planck equation for the dynamics of @xmath16 and @xmath0 . to summarize the approach",
    ", we remark that it can be shown that the time evolution along a lagrangian trajectory of the non - dimensional invariants @xmath26 and @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the strain variance , and @xmath31 is the non - dimensional time . also , @xmath32 stands for ( minus ) the deviatoric part of the pressure hessian , i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the viscous term ( recall that in the re approximation , @xmath35 ) . the fokker - planck equation describing the time evolution of the joint density @xmath36 may be written as : @xmath37 where the divergence of the _ probability current _ @xmath38 controls the time variations of the joint probability density @xmath39 . the probability current can be written in terms of conditional averages as @xmath40 and can be decomposed into @xmath41 , where the probability currents @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are associated , respectively , to the effects on the lagrangian evolution of the invariants @xmath0 and @xmath16 ( eqs . ( [ eq : dynq ] ) and ( [ eq : dynr ] ) ) of the restricted euler term @xmath6 , of ( minus ) the pressure hessian @xmath45 and of diffusivity @xmath46 entering in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsa ] ) . in this article , we will focus on the probability current associated with the pressure hessian @xmath43 . it can be written as @xmath47 more details are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the following ,",
    "we will make extensive use of data from standard direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equations , for a taylor - based reynolds number of order @xmath48 .",
    "dns is based on a pseudo - spectral method with 2nd - order accurate adams - bashforth time stepping ; the computation box is cubic ( size @xmath49 ) with periodic boundary conditions in the three directions and spatial resolution @xmath50 .",
    "statistical stationarity is maintained by an isotropic external force acting at low wavenumbers in order to ensure a constant energy - power supply .",

    "the kinematic viscosity of the fluid is @xmath52 .",
    "the kolmogorov s scale is @xmath53 so that @xmath54 , since @xmath55 .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](a ) the vector plot and streamlines of the probability current @xmath43 associated with the pressure hessian ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : wp ] ) ) in the @xmath56-plane , as it was done in ref .",
    "three main remarks can be made at this stage : ( i ) first , the pressure hessian counteracts the development of the finite time singularity along the right tail of the vieillefosse line implied by the re term , ( ii ) probabilities are found to be very low in the dissipation production dominated region ( i.e. @xmath57 and above the vieillefosse tail ) meaning that pressure does not play there a significant role , and ( iii ) pressure redistributes the probabilities towards the enstrophy production dominated region ( i.e. the flux is directed to the left , towards @xmath58 ) .",
    "as far as the restricted euler term is concerned , as is well known @xcite , the deterministic @xmath59 probability current pushes probabilities toward the right tail of the vieillefosse line ( data not shown ) .",
    "this result helps create a picture of the time evolution of velocity gradients along lagrangian trajectories in stationary flows : the re term `` pushes '' the probabilities towards the right tail towards and along the vieillefosse line , while the pressure regularizes the implied finite time singularity and redistributes the probabilities towards the left part of the plane such that , in turn , the re term can act again , etc . to that picture should be added the viscous diffusion effects , @xmath44 pushes the probabilities toward vanishing @xmath16 and @xmath0 not only along the vieillefosse line but also everywhere else , and stochastic forcing , such that the full probability current @xmath38 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtotal ] ) ) is divergence free , in order to ensure stationary statistics ( eq .",

    "[ fig : vectamprq](b ) the amplitude of @xmath43 , using logarithmic spacing of iso - probability lines .",

    "we remark that it would be interesting to quantify whether the effect of anisotropic pressure hessian is orthogonal to the @xmath17-plane in this region , when the @xmath17 plane is extended into three - dimensions , as proposed and studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us write a gaussian homogeneous , isotropic and incompressible vectorial field @xmath60 @xcite , having a correlation structure consistent with k41 scalings .",
    "it reads , in @xmath61-dimensions , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a gaussian vectorial white noise , and @xmath64 is a large - scale cut - off which involves the integral length scale @xmath65 .",
    "the deterministic kernel entering into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussvect ] ) is regularized over the small length scale @xmath66 , namely @xmath67 ( @xmath68 stands for the convolution product ) , with a mollifier @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "@xcite that the velocity @xmath71 has a well - defined limit when @xmath72 , denoted by @xmath60 , and such that @xmath73 when @xmath74 , with @xmath75 a constant independent on the vector @xmath76 .    a gaussian vectorial field , such as from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussvect ] ) , is a poor representation of turbulence since it does not reproduce several important features such as a mean energy transfer towards small scales ( i.e. the skewness phenomenon ) , the non - gaussianity of velocity increments ( i.e. the intermittency phenomenon ) and the alignment of vorticity with the intermediate eigenvector of the strain rate tensor @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to consider it in the analysis of the statistical quantities in which we are interested , such as the probability current @xmath43 associated with the pressure hessian ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : wp ] ) ) .",
    "in particular , we look at which part can be attributed to gaussian statistics and which part is really linked to turbulence .",
    "the gaussian velocity field ( eq . ( [ eq : gaussvect ] ) ) is computed in a periodic box in @xmath77 space dimensions , using @xmath78 collocation points .",

    "@xcite for further numerical details .",
    "the pressure @xmath83 is defined via the poisson equation @xmath84 , where @xmath15 is the ( gaussian ) velocity gradient tensor .",
    "figure [ fig : vectamprq](c ) shows the vector plot and streamlines of the probability current @xmath43 obtained from the gaussian velocity field eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussvect]). it can be seen that the pressure from the gaussian field does not counteract directly the singularity along the direction of the right tail of the vieillefosse line , as is the case in the dns .",
    "also , there is a significantly higher probability current in the right side region ( i.e. @xmath57 and above the viellefosse tail ) than in the dns .",
    "the pressure obtained from the gaussian field is only realistic in the enstrophy production dominated region ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , where the behavior shows indeed a trend to push the probability density towards this region",
    ". also , the streamlines cross the @xmath22 line meaning that the pressure field from the gaussian velocity field does produce non - zero effect even when @xmath22 .    in fig .",

    "it can be seen that the amplitude iso - values are symmetric with respect to the @xmath85 line .",
    "we are thus led to the conclusion that a gaussian velocity field , and its associated pressure field , do not make difference between dissipation production dominated regions ( @xmath57 ) and enstrophy production dominated regions ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "based on the recent fluid deformation imposed by the euler flow @xcite , and further heuristic introduction of the multifractal structure of turbulence as observed from extensive empirical data ( see e.g. @xcite ) , ref .",

    "we will take in the sequel @xmath93 in order to be consistent with empirical findings @xcite .",
    "generation of the vectorial field @xmath71 can be done accurately and efficiently in periodic boxes using up to @xmath94 collocations points , in a similar way as done for the gaussian velocity field",

    "the cost of the computation of the matrix exponential is the limiting numerical step .",
    "it is estimated at each point of space using a pad approximant with scaling and squaring ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it has been shown numerically ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the multifractal velocity field eq . ( [ eq : multivel]) gives a realistic representation of instantaneous realizations of velocity fields in fully developed turbulence in the inertial range , in regard to the following properties : ( i ) longitudinal @xmath95 and transverse velocity increments are intermittent , @xmath92 being the intermittency coefficient , ( ii ) the third - order moment @xmath96 is negative and proportional to the scale @xmath97 .",
    "the fact that there is negative skewness @xmath98 means that * u * exhibits a non - vanishing mean energy transfer towards the small scales and ( iii ) vorticity gets preferentially aligned with the eigenvector of the strain - rate tensor corresponding to the intermediate eigenvalue .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](e ) the vector plot and streamlines of the probability current @xmath43 obtained from the multifractal velocity field .",
    "it can be seen that , in a similar fashion to the gaussian case , streamlines are roughly symmetric with respect to the @xmath85 line .",
    "this is not consistent with dns in the @xmath57 region , but it is still realistic in the @xmath58 region . the difference with the gaussian field is the fact that now the joint density of @xmath99 and @xmath100 is not symmetric with respect to the @xmath85 line , showing thus the predominance of the regions for enstrophy - enstrophy production ( upper - left quadrant , which in turbulent flows is correlated with vortex stretching ) and dissipation - dissipation production ( lower - right quadrant , connected with biaxial straining in turbulent flows ) .",
    "this is also the case for the probability current amplitude , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](f ) .",
    "we can see therefore that both the gaussian and multifractal velocity fields do not reproduce the void in probability in the @xmath57 region as observed in dns , but they do reproduce accurately the probability current evolutions in the @xmath58 regions and the presence of probability flux at @xmath22 .",
    "we consider a third case of a synthetic velocity field . the minimal turnover lagrangian map ( mtlm ) velocity field",

    "the parameter @xmath114 is taken equal to the eddy - turnover time - scale corresponding to the spatial scale @xmath108 , computed using standard kolmogorov scaling .",
    "new velocity values at the collocation points are obtained by interpolation over nearby velocities that have come into a neighborhood of radius @xmath108 around @xmath111 after the mapping .",
    "this deformed field @xmath109 is made solenoidal again by projection in fourier space , and the amplitudes of its fourier modes are scaled to conform to the target energy spectrum .",
    "finally , @xmath109 is recombined with the @xmath110 part , which at this stage still remains as a gaussian field .    the next generation in the hierarchy",
    "will take the complete field @xmath115 and will apply the same distortion operations , now with the field decomposed at a smaller filtering scale . in this way",
    ", the effects are superposed and accumulated over a range of spatial scales .",
    "further details and characteristics of these synthetic velocity fields can be found in refs .",
    "the present mtlm velocity field was generated in a periodic box , using @xmath50 collocation points , with @xmath116 generations in the hierarchy , and an energy spectrum corresponding to @xmath117 .",
    "the results for the probability current @xmath43 obtained from the mtlm velocity field ( eq . ( [ eq : mtlmvel ] ) ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](e - f ) . when compared with the dns results ( figs .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](a - b ) ) , we can see close agreement of both magnitude and direction of @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , the mtlm velocity field reproduces , for pressure - related part of the probability current , the void of probability in the @xmath57 region . we can conclude that , of the three cases studied , the mtlm velocity field gives the most realistic synthetic turbulence , as far as anisotropic pressure hessian effects are concerned .",
    "but some small difference can be observed in the @xmath57 region , close to the origin , where the mtlm fields seem to predict a circular motion that is not present in dns .      as previously noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , current closures for the pressure hessian @xcite are proportional to the invariant @xmath0 .",
    "this is in particular the case for the closure provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the statistically stationary cauchy - green tensor at the kolmogorov time scale @xmath120 @xcite and @xmath121 .",
    "indeed , it is tempting to close the anisotropic part of * p * as a symmetric tensor proportional to @xmath0 , since the isotropic part is itself proportional to @xmath0 as seen on the poisson equation @xmath122 .",

    "the corresponding conditional average @xmath125 was shown for fields obtained by dns as well as by applying the closure ( eq .",

    "furthermore , we have shown that synthetic velocity fields do predict the pressure hessian square norm as being closer to linearly proportional to the invariant @xmath0 , rather than proportional to @xmath128 as is the case in existing closures , in particular eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmph ] ) .    at this stage",
    ", one could reach the conclusion that some approximate surrogates of an actual turbulent field , even when obtained with the simplest gaussian approximation , contain a better prediction of the behavior of the pressure hessian , in connection with its dependence on @xmath0 , than the deterministic closure given by eq .",

    "we will see in the following that the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian can in fact be accurately closed by the local spatial variations of the invariant @xmath0 .",

    "requires the computation of the second derivative of @xmath0 , which is already the square of a first spatial derivative .",
    "this is a reason for our use of the highly resolved dns under study , in which @xmath54 ( see section [ dnsvf ] ) . using @xmath148",
    ", we find that for the current dns our choice of the length scale @xmath140 as eq .",
    "( [ eq : choiceeta ] ) implies that @xmath149 .",
    "hence , @xmath140 is of the order of @xmath25 , as required .",
    "let us stress that a well resolved dns is necessary since some noise can be introduced by the computation of third order derivatives , leading to a bad estimation of the parameter @xmath140 .",
    "more work is needed to clarify this point and to assess the dependence of @xmath140 on resolution effects and reynolds numbers .",

    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenplotlev ] the joint probability densities of the three eigenvalues of the deviatoric part of the true pressure hessian , ( denoted by @xmath150 ) and the corresponding eigenvalues of the expression @xmath151 ( denoted by @xmath152 ) . the smallest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenplotlev](a ) ) and largest eigenvalues ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenplotlev](c ) ) are found to be well correlated with joint density contours are elongated along the perfect correlation line ( i.e. @xmath153 ) , and correlation coefficients of @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively .    as far as the intermediate eigenvalue is concerned , weaker correlation is found ( @xmath156 ) , with isolines being close to circles .",
    "we can conclude that the smallest and largest eigenvalues are well correlated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenplotlev](d ) we display the probability of the cosine of the angle between the eigenvectors of the left and right terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : localclos ] ) .",
    "it is found that in all the cases , corresponding to the three different eigenvalues , the maximum of probability is reached when the eigenvectors of @xmath136 and @xmath151 are aligned .",
    "these results show then that @xmath136 and @xmath151 are correlated both in amplitude and eigendirections .",
    "we have seen that , in tensorial structure , the true pressure hessian @xmath136 and the local expression in terms of velocity gradients @xmath151 are quite similar .",
    "we may now wonder if the local expression is able to reproduce the probability current associated to pressure effects as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](a - b ) . to this purpose ,",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : vectamphq](a - b ) the probability current @xmath123 obtained from dns when the true pressure hessian is replaced by the local expression ( [ eq : localclos ] ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](a ) that indeed the local expression reproduces the counteractive action of the pressure along the right tail of the vieillefosse line .",
    "furthermore , a void in probability is found in dissipation production dominated regions ( i.e. @xmath57 ) , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](b ) .",
    "finally , the local expression also reproduces some of the probability redistribution in the enstrophy production dominated region ( @xmath58 ) , as observed in dns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamprq](a - b ) ) , although the direction of the probability flux streamlines for @xmath58 is seen to be more vertical than the left - wards directions seen in the dns .",
    "also , the streamlines are found more curved for the local expression than for * p * and the probability current amplitude @xmath157 is found to decrease faster at high values of @xmath16 and @xmath0 than in the dns case .",
    "this could be due to limitations of the localized expression in reproducing very high turbulent fluctuations    the overall behavior of the local expression in the @xmath17-plane is on the whole quite satisfactory when compared against dns .",
    "some differences appear : ( i ) the streamlines of the probability current are found more curved for the local closure than for * p * , very much in opposition to the streamlines imposed by the re approximation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and ( ii ) the probability current amplitude @xmath157 is found to decrease faster at high values of @xmath16 and @xmath0 than in the dns case .",
    "this could be due to limitations of the localized expression in reproducing very high turbulent fluctuations . on the whole , however , the trends provided by the local expression eq . ( [ eq : localclos ] ) agree quite well compared to the dns results in terms of the prbability fluxes in the @xmath17 plane .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamphq](c ) the conditional expectation of the pressure hessian square norm , based on @xmath0 . for the sake of clarity , we show again the conditional average as obtained in dns ( solid line ) ( it was already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : condphonq ] ) .",
    "we use open symbols ( @xmath158 ) to show the conditional expectation obtained from dns using the local approximation ( [ eq : localclos ] ) .",
    "it can been seen that the conditional expectation obtained from the local approximation is in very good agreement with the dns , with some discrepancies appearing for negative @xmath100 .",
    "interestingly , we see that the conditional expectation does not vanish for @xmath22 .",
    "this is consistent with former remarks made about the requirement that a realistic model of @xmath10 can not be simply proportional to @xmath0 .    finally , to quantify the agreement between individual tensor elements , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : vectamphq](d ) the joint pdf of the component @xmath159 and the component @xmath160 .",
    "this plot demonstrates the good level of correlation between these two tensors since the joint pdf is clearly elongated along the perfect correlation line ( i.e. @xmath161 ) .",
    "the corresponding correlation coefficient is @xmath162 .",
    "thus , also this statistical test confirms the good agreement between the local approximation and the true pressure hessian .",
    "this article focuses on the statistical nature of the pressure hessian that governs much of the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor in turbulence . in a first part",
    ", we have seen that synthetic velocity fields reproduce many properties of the pressure hessian as they are seen in dns flows , such as the non - trivial behavior of the probability current , and the conditional expectation of the pressure hessian norm on the invariant @xmath0 .",
    "even the simplest gaussian approximation for the velocity field ( eq . ( [ eq : gaussvect ] ) ) can represent some non - trivial behaviors of the pressure that could not be predicted by the closures in terms of * a * @xcite . based on this observation and on an exact field description of the pressure hessian by means of nonlocal integrals ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : soph ] ) and ( [ eq : pdtoqd ] ) ) , we formulate the hypothesis that considering only the integration over a ball of radius @xmath25 , and neglecting other contributions , the deviatoric part of * p * could be expressed in terms of local properties of the velocity gradient tensor , but in terms of higher - order derivatives .",
    "specifically , the spatially local approximation is not expressed in terms of @xmath15 but in terms of second - order derivatives of @xmath0 .",
    "this approximation was found to be highly correlated with the true pressure hessian * p * when compared in dns computations .",
    "these findings show that the main contribution to * p*(*x * ) is contained in the local neighborhood around position * x * , in a ball centered at * x * and of radius of the order of @xmath25 .",
    "this raises the hope that local closures involving a finite set of ordinary differential equations may still be possible , for studying the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor . to that end , it is still necessary to express the hessian of @xmath0 in terms of the local values of @xmath15 .",
    "only then would we have a full closure .",
    "let us finally remark that if a tractable transport equation for the pressure hessian is difficult to get , the lagrangian derivatives of @xmath83 and @xmath10 can be related .",
    "we get the following transport equation for the pressure hessian @xmath163 where @xmath164 stands for the upper convected time derivative or oldroyd derivative , that relates the rate of change written in the coordinate system rotating and stretching with the fluid ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. @xmath165 then , if we neglect the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : transph ] ) in the rate of change of the pressure hessian , i.e. if we assume that the oldroyd derivative ( [ eq : oldroyd ] ) vanishes , and we apply the recent fluid deformation ( rfd ) approximation ( assuming @xmath15 independent on time ) , we get that for an early time @xmath166 this remark justifies the use of matrix exponentials as closures of the pressure hessian @xcite , as it was also noted for the subgrid - scale stress tensor @xcite .",
    "if in addition we start from an initial isotropic pressure hessian , and include the poisson equation , we recover exactly the closure ( [ eq : cmph ] ) proposed in ref .",
