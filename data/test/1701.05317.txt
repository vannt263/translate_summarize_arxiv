    "[ fig - ssh - topo](a ) .",
    "only the trajectory that encircles this degeneracy point , i.e. , the critical point of the topological transition , can detect a quantized number @xcite , which is the topological invariant of the ssh model .",

    "we consider a situation where the number of sites are different for the two sublattices .",

    "other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig - ssh - topo].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    that the edge mode is non - degenerate can be explained as follows .",
    "here we have an odd number of total lattice sites @xmath96 .",
    "following the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec - topo ] , we first make the unitary transformation with @xmath39 where @xmath97 , to eliminate the @xmath98 term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamitonian_origin ] ) , as this term does not change the topological properties of the system .",
    "thus , the generalized ssh hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamitonian_origin ] ) with @xmath99 , becomes that of the original ssh model , @xmath100 whose form in the momentum space has been given in eq .",
    "( [ eq - ssh2 ] ) .",
    "the system , described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamitonian_ssh ] ) , respects the chiral symmetry , implying that for each eigenstate @xmath101 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamitonian_ssh ] ) with energy @xmath102 , we can obtain another state @xmath103 with the opposite energy @xmath104 via a unitary transformation @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamitonian_ssh ] ) hosts @xmath93 sets of energy pairs @xmath106 , leaving a single zero - energy mode @xmath107 as the edge mode . for the original hamiltonian , which includes the @xmath98 term , the above analyses are still valid , as @xmath98 only results in an energy shift to the energy spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ fig - boundary](b ) .",
    "therefore , the single zero - energy mode is robust unless the chiral symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamitonian_ssh ] ) is broken .",
    "further examination shows that this edge mode is localized at the right ( left ) end of the chain if @xmath108 ( @xmath91 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - boundary](c ) . as @xmath109",
    ", the edge mode becomes less localized as its spatial width increases . at @xmath12 , the bulk gap closes , the edge mode dissolves into the bulk , and the system becomes topologically trivial .",
    "therefore , in this situation , @xmath12 remains as a critical point for the topological phase transition .",
    "however , unlike the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - ssh - topo ] , here the system is topologically nontrivial at both sides of this critical point , with the corresponding edge state localized at opposite ends of the chain .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the creation of artificial magnetic field in optical lattice systems using the technique of laser - assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "this technique can be implemented in our system , and the resulting model describes an effective 2d triangular lattice . to see this",
    ", we first suppress the conventional intra - sublattice tunneling by introducing a tilt along the lattice direction ( for simplicity , we assume the tilt is spin - independent , hence the two sublattices are tilted in the same way . ) .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by including gravity along the same direction , or by adding a magnetic gradient field .",
    "subsequently , we restore the intra - sublattice tunneling by two laser beams with different wave number @xmath110 and @xmath111 along the lattice direction , and with a frequency difference @xmath112 matching the energy different between adjacent lattice sites with the same sublattice . here",
    "we consider a simple setup with offset angle @xmath12 .",
    "after time averaging over the rapidly oscillating terms , we obtain a complex intra - sublattice tunneling amplitude : @xmath113 for spin @xmath6 and @xmath114 for spin @xmath2 with @xmath115 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - flux ] ( a ) .",
    "the inter - sublattice tunneling is still induced by the rf field .     versus the particular flux @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath102 is in units of @xmath3 and we set @xmath117.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    for this situation , if we exploit the fermion operator index mapping ( [ eq - map ] ) again , the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath118 where we assume @xmath119 . from hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamit - flux ] ) , the lattice system indeed mimics a magnetic field with a tunable flux @xmath116 around each triangular plaquette as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - flux ] ( a ) .",
    "different from the conventional magnetic field , the flux in each triangular cell induced by the synthetic magnetic field is staggered , rather than homogeneous @xcite . the corresponding energy spectrum as a function of @xmath116",

    "[ fig - flux ] ( b ) .",
    "we can clearly find a fractal pattern if @xmath120 ( @xmath0 , @xmath121 are prime integers ) , which is known as the hofstadter butterfly as a feature of the synthetic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "if periodic boundary condition is implemented , the energy band for each flux @xmath120 is split into @xmath121 sub - bands .",
    "therefore , our lattice model provides an alternative route to synthesize the magnetic fields in a 1d system , and can be utilized in studying various intriguing effects @xcite .",
    "we note that similar artificial magnetic field can be realized in our model by keeping the intra - sublattice tunneling conventional , but induce the inter - sublattice tunneling with a pair of raman beams instead of an rf field . in this way , @xmath4 and @xmath5 become complex .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a protocol to realize a wide variety of topological models , based on a spin - dependent optical lattice potential . we have shown how unconventional tunneling , staggered zeeman field , and artificial staggered magnetic flux can be readily engineered with our platform . in this realization , many of the key parameters can be independently controlled , and various boundary conditions can be constructed .",
    "therefore this realization allows us to explore a variety of exotic lattice models that are difficult to be realized in conventional condensed matter systems .    in the present work ,",
    "we have focused on the single - particle physics .",
    "if we introduce the @xmath1-wave interaction between the two spin states , we can have effective @xmath0-wave interaction as was demonstrated in our earlier work @xcite . for nonzero offset angle , the strength of this effective interaction becomes staggered , which may give rise to unconventional phases .",
