    "the landau criterion  @xcite concerns the threshold velocity @xmath1 of an obstacle moving through stationary superfluids at zero temperature , beyond which excitations are created and superfluidity is lost . by galilean invariance , the criterion also applies to the threshold velocity @xmath1 of a uniformly flowing superfluid ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the value of the threshold velocity @xmath1 is determined by the following formula @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the excitation spectrum . for superconductors",
    "the landau criterion gives @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pairing gap at zero temperature and zero flow , and @xmath6 is the fermi momentum of the entities that are paired ( with @xmath7 being the associated angular wavenumber ) .",
    "however , it was found by rogers  @xcite that in three spatial dimensions the critical velocity @xmath8the uniform velocity of the superfluid condensate at which the superconducting state becomes unstable  of a clean superconductor exceeds @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed , e.g. , in ref  @xcite , for superflow velocities @xmath9 in the range @xmath10 , gapless excitations occur in clean superconductors .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath11 has been found to be @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "in contrast to the case of three dimensions , in neither one nor two dimensions is gapless superconductivity predicted to occur in the presence of flow .    in this paper , we re - analyze the critical velocity of a clean superconductor in one spatial dimension via a mean - field treatment , and obtain the dependence of this velocity on the temperature @xmath16 , along with the associated temperature - velocity phase diagram .",
    "in particular , we find that at zero temperature the critical velocity is smaller by a factor of @xmath0 than the landau critical velocity @xmath1 .",
    "even though for @xmath17 a gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum remains , the superconducting state first becomes unstable there .",
    "this is in contrast to a previous report  @xcite , which held that the critical velocity is @xmath1 , i.e. , the velocity at which the gap in the quasiparticle spectrum closes and excitations proliferate so as to destroy superconductivity .",
    "the smaller value of the critical velocity , which we obtain here , is the result of a pre - emptive clogston - chandrasekhar  like discontinuous phase transition  @xcite , and is analogous to the threshold uniform exchange - field in a superconductor , previously investigated by sarma  @xcite and by maki and tsuneto  @xcite . at low temperatures (",
    "i.e. , for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the critical temperature in the absence of flow ) , the transition from the superconducting to the normal state , occurring due to the presence of flow , remains discontinuous .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath20 the transition is continuous , i.e. , it is associated with a continuously vanishing order parameter , e.g. , as @xmath16 approaches the flow - velocity  dependent transition temperature @xmath21 from below .    from the experimental standpoint , it is usually more convenient to control the condensate _",
    "current _ rather than its _ velocity_. ( an exception is provided by a closed loop threaded by magnetic flux . ) the more widely appropriate physical observable is thus the critical current , i.e. , the maximum equilibrium current that a superconductor can sustain , and this is what experiments on superconductors frequently measure .",
    "it should , however , be remarked that recent experiments on trapped condensates of atomic gases make it possible to probe the critical velocity directly  @xcite .",
    "langer and fisher  @xcite introduced a fresh perspective on the issue of the critical velocity of a sueprfluid .",
    "they explained that  as a matter of principle  superflow is inherently unstable , even at velocities below those that allow quasiparticle excitations to proliferate .",
    "this instability results from the possible occurrence of intrinsic , topologically allowed , collective excitation events , in which , e.g. , a vortex ring nucleates locally , traverses an arrhenius energy barrier , and grows without bound , thus eradicating a quantum of flow velocity . in the case of narrow channels , such as the one - dimensional superconductors discussed here",
    ", the fluctuations take the form of phase slip events , which can be either thermal  @xcite or quantum  @xcite .",
    "but , before one takes into account the effects of fluctuations , it is important to understand and clarify the behavior at the mean - field level , which is mainly what we consider in the present paper .",
    "in other words , the work reported here assumes that the rate of such toplogical fluctuations is negligibly small , so that our critical - velocity results , established on the basis of thermodynamic stability and the possibility of quasiparticle production , retain a use . in the present paper we focus on issues of phases of thermodynamic equilibrium ,",

    "thus , when assessing the relative thermodynamic stability of a liquid and a crystalline state , one must specify a displacement field for the crystal but one must not ( and indeed can not ) do so for the liquid state . it is meaningful to speak of an equilibrium crystalline state that supports a specified static shear stress , but not so for a liquid , as stress would induce a nonequilibrium dissipative steady state of shear flow , in which entropy would constantly be being produced . in summary",
    ", there is a unique equilibrium state for the liquid , but there is a family of equilibrium states for the crystal , differing in their displacement field ( or strain field , or its thermodynamic conjugate , the stress field ) .",
    "one is entitled to consider the relative thermodynamic stability of a liquid and any one of this family of crystalline states .",
    "returning now to the case of superconductivity , the precise analogy is on the one hand between the crystal and the superconductor , and on the other hand between the liquid and the normal metal .",
    "one is thus entitled to consider the relative thermodynamic stability of a stationary normal state and any one of the family of the flowing superconducting states . that there is a family of flowing superconducting states originates in the spontaneously broken gauge symmetry of the superconducting state , which amounts to a controllable thermodynamic field , ( i.e. , the phase field ) , which is the analog of the displacement field of the crystal .",

    "the energy difference between the flowing and stationary normal states plays the role of the paramagnetic energy .",
    "we shall see that the true equilibrium transition temperature then has exactly the functional form obtained by sarma  @xcite and by maki and tsuneto  @xcite .",

    ". to account for this effect , we use the scenario of the orbital pair - breaking effect of a parallel magnetic field applied to a film of finite thickness @xmath197 ( which is about @xmath198 in the experiment ) , which leads us to add to the argument of the second term on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
