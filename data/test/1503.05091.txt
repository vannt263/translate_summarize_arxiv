    "the past decade has witnessed the growing power of quantum entanglements developed from the quantum information in understanding the novel quantum states and quantum phase transitions in solids@xcite .",
    "condensed matter systems involve spin-@xmath0 objects as natural qubits and various spin exchange interactions as sources of quantum correlations .",
    "the present paper will explore from the quantum entanglement perspective the variable kondo effect in a two - impurity kondo model ( tikm ) , an intriguing problem involving two typical kinds of spin exchanges .",
    "it is known that kondo systems , consisting of both itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments , naturally involves the single - ion kondo effect and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "the competition between them plays a key role in correlated systems ranging from diluted mangetic alloys to heavy fermion compounds@xcite .",
    "the issue has been intensively investigated within the tikm@xcite where , in addition to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) kondo coupling between a magnetic impurity ( or local moment ) and its spatially nearby conduction electron , the two magnetic impurities are also coupled due to the rkky interaction .",
    "there are two stable fixed points : the strong kondo coupling limit with each impurity spins being completely quenched by the kondo effect , and the strong rkky interaction limit with a different antiferromagnetic spin singlet@xcite .",
    "the later situation has usually an afm ordered groundstate in the concentrated kondo lattice case@xcite .",
    "the tikm has been realized in nanoscale devices where the observed kondo signature varies with tunable rkky interaction@xcite .",
    "in addition to the conventional spin - density wave quantum phase transition , the variation of kondo effect and its competition with magnetic order in the kondo lattice systems may result in a local type of quantum phase transition signaled by a breakdown of kondo effect.@xcite    theoretically , the primary focus is on the intermediate regime where the single - ion kondo and rkky energy scales , represented by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , are comparable to each other so that the physical properties of the two stable fixed points crossover@xcite",
    ". of particular interesting is the case when the crossover is sharpened leading to a phase transition .",
    "early numerical renormalization group@xcite and conformal field theory studies@xcite on the particle - hole symmetric tikm revealed an unstable interacting fixed point at a finite ratio @xmath3 where non - fermi liquid behaviors such as the divergent staggered susceptibility and specific heat coefficient were observed .",
    "it was soon pointed out by rasul and schlottmann@xcite that these intriguing features can be understood phenomenologically by an _",
    "spin - only _ effective model involving two impurity spins @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and two conduction electron spins @xmath6 , @xmath7 , as shown in fig.[picture ] . as a result of many - body process , the interaction terms in the corresponding hamiltonian eq.([h1 ] ) emerge from the low energy regime of the original tikm@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 describes the splitting between the kondo singlet and the spin triplet states , while the cross - coupling @xmath8 represents the interaction - induced frustration .",
    "it is known that the critical point may be replaced by a crossover in the absence of particle - hole symmetry@xcite , while with this symmetry a large degeneracy at the critical point is observed @xcite .",
    "compatible with this observation , the rasul - schlottmann ( rs ) spin model indeed exhibits an enhanced degeneracy at a special point @xmath9 corresponding to the critical point@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , kondo effect or kondo screening is conceptually associated with the notion of `` kondo entanglement '' @xcite .",
    "the kondo models with a single or two magnetic impurities have been investigated from the quantum entanglement perspective@xcite . for the single impurity kondo problem ,",
    "kondo screening implies formation of a kondo singlet groundstate@xcite .",
    "this is an entangled state consisting of the two parts , one is the local magnetic impurity , another is the rest of the whole system .",
    "the entanglement between the two parts defines the so - called single - impurity kondo entanglement ( sike ) , a measure of kondo entanglement typically quantified by the von neumann entropy@xcite .",
    "the sike in a gapless bulk follows the well - known scaling law of the thermodynamic entropy at large distance over the coherent length of the kondo cloud@xcite . for the tikm ,",
    "several different impurity - related entanglements are considered .",
    "similar to the sike , one could consider the two - impurity kondo entanglement ( tike ) , i.e. , the entanglement between the two impurities and the rest of the system .",
    "the tike can be also measured by the von neumann entropy@xcite .",
    "another useful quantity is the inter - impurity entanglement ( iie ) , i.e. , the entanglement between the two local magnetic impurities@xcite .",
    "such iie can be quantified by concurrence or negativity@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the iie is non - zero when the rkky interaction is at least several times larger than the kondo energy scale@xcite . however , this feature alone does not sufficiently guarantee a true phase transition@xcite nor necessarily imply a full suppression of the kondo effect .",
    "one should notice that the sike and tike quantified by the von neumann entropy in kondo systems with two- or more impurities usually mix the contributions from conduction electrons and other impurities@xcite , hence these quantities are not as distinct as in the single impurity kondo problem . therefore , an alternative measure of the kondo entanglement , capable of characterizing the variation of kondo screening across the quantum critical point in generic multi - impurity systems , is highly desirable@xcite .    in this paper , we investigate a _ local kondo entanglement _ ( lke ) , namely , the entanglement between a magnetic impurity and its near - by conduction electron only . the definition of the lke in generic kondo systems is described in appendix a. generally , suppression of this quantity should imply the complete destruction of the kondo effect , though its connection with the impurity quantum phase transition as in the generic tikm remains to be clarified . as a concrete example , the iie and lke in the rs model are evaluated on equal - footing , both quantified by the concurrence or negativity .",
    "an entanglement phase diagram is then obtained , exhibiting the crossover from the kondo singlet phase ( with non - zero lke ) to the inter - impurity afm phase ( with non - zero iie ) .",
    "a critical point @xmath10 emerges along the strong frustration line @xmath11 where both lke and iie show sudden changes and the groundstate wavefunction shows a discontinuity . in the following sections , we shall present the results of the exact solutions of the rs model , the entanglement phase diagram , as well as an entanglement monogamy .",
    "we also briefly discuss implications of these results for generic kondo lattices and quantum information processing .",
    "the rs spin model , presumably taking into account the effective many - body process , is a fixed - point hamiltonian of the tikm .",
    "it is described by@xcite @xmath12+j_r { \\vec s}_a\\cdot{\\vec s}_b \\nonumber\\\\ & & + ~k[{\\vec s}_a\\cdot{\\vec s}_c(b)+{\\vec s}_b\\cdot{\\vec s}_c(a ) ] .",
    "\\label{h1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the spin operators of the local moments at sites @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the electron spin density at the spatial site @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the annihilation operator of conduction electrons and @xmath17 the pauli matrices . in the present two - impurity kondo problem ,",
    "only the spin degrees of freedom are relevant while the charge degrees of freedom are frozen .",
    "thus @xmath6 and @xmath7 are treated as two electron spins localized at the sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the interaction parameters include @xmath1 , the single - ion kondo temperature , @xmath2 , the intersite rkky interaction energy , and @xmath8 , the cross kondo coupling between the local moments and the electron spins , as shown in fig.[picture]@xcite .",
    "all these interaction terms are spin-@xmath20 invariant .",
    "the direct kondo coupling takes place between the impurity and conduction electron in the assigned nearest neighboring sites @xmath21 or @xmath22 . the cross kondo coupling term ( @xmath8 ) is induced effectively in the low energy limit of the original tikm and @xmath23 when the even / odd channel symmetry is imposed . for our purpose",
    "we will assume that @xmath24 and @xmath8 are tunable independently with respect to @xmath1 . because eq .",
    "( 1 ) is invariant under a combination of the impurity permutation @xmath25 and the exchange @xmath26 , the regime with strong frustration corresponds to @xmath11 .",
    "hence we only need to consider @xmath27 . in the following we set @xmath28 without losing generality .    ,",
    "@xmath2 , and @xmath8 represent the single - ion kondo energy scale , the rkky interaction , and the interaction induced cross kondo coupling .",
    "various entanglements among these spins are defined in the text.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the eigenstates of @xmath29 can be classified into six catalogs : two singlets , three triplets , and one quintet , according to the decomposition of tensor representations of the @xmath20 group : @xmath30 as listed in appendix b. these eigenstates are constructed based on a complete set of the conventional basis @xmath31 and labeled by the total spin @xmath32 , its z - component @xmath33 , and the parity ( with respect to permutations of the two local moments ) @xcite .",
    "because we consider @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath8 are all afm , the groundstate is among the mixed states of the two singlets of even parity .",
    "they are denoted by ( each up to a normalization factor ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 the corresponding eigen energies are @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "another relevant low energy states are from the odd triplet @xmath39 the corresponding eigen energy is @xmath40    it is apparent that the groundstate of the rs hamiltonian eq.([h1 ] ) is the singlet @xmath41 .",
    "however , the repulsive level spacing ( energy gap ) @xmath42 vanishes at a special point @xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath43 , so that the singlet @xmath44 is degenerate with @xmath41 at this point .",
    "meanwhile , the odd triplet @xmath45 is degenerate with @xmath41 for @xmath46 .",
    "hence the model indeed shows a strong frustration along the line @xmath47 and exhibits an enlarged symmetry at @xmath10@xcite .",
    "the precise wavefunctions across the @xmath10 point can be determined by taking either limits ( @xmath48 ) and ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 .",
    "it readily reveals a discontinuity in @xmath41 as shown in appendix b.",
    "now , we start from the conventional kondo impurity entanglement , i.e. , the sike defined as the entanglement between a local moment , say @xmath51 , and the rest of the system , denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "it is measured by the van norman entropy @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the reduced density matrix @xmath55 . here , @xmath56 is the density matrix for the groundstate ( in our case @xmath57 ) of the whole system .",
    "it is straightforwardly seen that @xmath58 due to the @xmath20-spin invariance , indicating a maximal entanglement between a local moment and the reminder of the whole system .",
    "next , we consider the tike , the entanglement of the two local moments with the conduction electrons .",
    "following ref.@xcite , this entanglement is determined by the reduced density matrix of the two impurities , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 indicating trace over the hilbert subspace spanned by the conduction electrons .",
    "it can be quantified by the von neumann entropy@xcite @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is the fidelity of the spin singlet within the reduced two impurity state , and @xmath63    @xmath64 is then evaluated on the groundstate @xmath65 as shown in fig.[tike ] .",
    "we find that @xmath64 is not only a smoothly varying function of @xmath66 as already shown in ref.@xcite , but also a smooth function of @xmath8 and @xmath2 without detectable feature across the point @xmath10 .     and",
    "@xmath8.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    now we turn to the iie .",
    "it can be measured by the concurrence or negativity , @xmath67 .",
    "its evaluation is also related to the reduced two - impurity density matrix @xmath68 .",
    "the concurrence can be expressed by@xcite @xmath69 the result is plotted in fig.[concurrence](a ) . for fixed @xmath70",
    ", @xmath67 increases continuously with @xmath2 . for @xmath47",
    ", @xmath67 shows a sudden increase from zero to unity when @xmath2 goes across @xmath71 .     and @xmath8 .",
    "the single - ion kondo energy scale is taken as unit @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   and @xmath8 .",
    "the single - ion kondo energy scale is taken as unit @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    together with the observed discontinuity in the groundstate wavefunction , the jump in iie evidences a transition at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "but its relation with the suppression of kondo effect remains uncertain .",
    "we now turn to an alternative definition of the kondo entanglement , i.e. , the lke between a local moment , say @xmath72 , and the conduction electron at its nearest neighbor site , @xmath73 .",
    "the lke differs to the conventional impurity entanglement as it involves only a spatially neighboring pair formed by a local moment and a conduction electron .",
    "this local kondo pair is defined in the original real space point - contact kondo interaction @xmath74 ( with @xmath75 being the original kondo coupling ) as shown in appendix a. similar to iie , the lke can be evaluated by the concurrence or negativity , via the corresponding reduced density matrix @xmath76 , with @xmath77 indicating the trace in the hilbert space except the subspace spanned by @xmath4 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus we have @xmath79 where @xmath80 the result of @xmath81 is plotted in fig.[concurrence](b ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath81 develops a maximum for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and decreases monotonically for @xmath84 .",
    "but along the line @xmath47 it shows a sudden suppression @xmath84 .",
    "an entanglement phase diagram in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath2 is then drawn in fig.[diagram ] , where three different phases divided by the lines @xmath85 and @xmath86 are indicated : the iie phase ( @xmath87,@xmath88 ) , the lke phase ( @xmath89,@xmath90 ) , and the co - existence phase ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) . the iie and lke phases contact only at the point @xmath10 : by increasing @xmath2 across @xmath10 along the strong frustration line @xmath47 , @xmath66 has a sudden drop from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , @xmath95 has a jump from @xmath94 to @xmath96 . or",
    ", @xmath97 has a jump from @xmath96 to @xmath98 while @xmath81 has a sudden drop from @xmath99 to @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , together with the discontinuity of the wavefunction @xmath100 , the sudden changes along the line @xmath47 in the iie and lke do evidence a phase transition accompanied by a breakdown of kondo effect .",
    "of course , a true second order phase transition usually involves a continuous variation of the order parameter before its suppression .",
    "so the discontinuity exhibited in the iie or lke ( as an order parameter here ) is seemingly due to the simplicity of the present model involving only two conduction electrons .",
    "we notice that the inter - impurity spin - spin correlation function , closely related to the iie discussed here , was actually calculated in the early numerical renormalization group study @xcite at low yet finite temperatures , where the calculated quantity did not exhibit a sudden discontinuity but a rather sharp change at the critical point .",
    "interestingly , a more recent calculation based on the natural orbitals renormlization group method does find a suddent jump of this quantity at zero temperture@xcite .",
    "therefore , the discontinuity of the iie and lke may be not limited to the present model , but a generic feature of the impurity state involving finite degrees of freedom at quantum critical points .",
    "this discontinuity could be smeared when the impurity degrees of freedom become infinite as in the kondo lattice case .     and @xmath101 .",
    "these two lines intersect at the singular point @xmath102 , where the coexistence regime diminishes leading to a kondo breakdown transition to the afm singlet phase.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "in order to clarify whether the phase with non - zero @xmath67 or @xmath92 corresponds to the afm inter - impurity or kondo singlets , we calculate the normalized wavefunction overlaps @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "we consider the pure state of the kondo screening phase ( denoted by @xmath105 ) as the groundstate at the fixed point @xmath106 .",
    "similarly , we denote @xmath107 the pure inter - impurity afm state at the fixed point @xmath108 . here , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , with @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "we find that in the regime with @xmath90 or @xmath115 the respective wavefunction overlap vanishes .",
    "therefore , the obtained entanglement phase diagram fig.[diagram ] reflects the overall evolution from the kondo singlet to the inter - impurity afm singlet .",
    "specifically , increasing @xmath8 will enhance the frustration , so that the fidelities of @xmath105 and @xmath107 on the true groundstate @xmath116 change with varying @xmath2 .",
    "the fidelities can be calculated as the normalized wavefunction overlaps @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the three - dimensional plots of the wavefunctions overlaps are shown in fig.[fidelity](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fidelity](b ) , respectively .",
    "fig.[fidelity2](a ) and fig.[fidelity2](b ) show the @xmath2-dependence of these quantities for fixed values of @xmath8 .",
    "we find that @xmath119 increases rapidly with @xmath2 and saturates to 1 after entering the afm phase , @xmath84 .",
    "notice that @xmath118 always approaches to @xmath99 for @xmath120 , indicating that the kondo singlet fidelity @xmath121 .",
    "as shown in appendix a , this implies the non - correlated kondo state or a full suppression of kondo effect .     on the groundstate @xmath122 .",
    "( b ) the fidelity of the inter - impurity afm singlet @xmath107 on the groundstate @xmath122.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   on the groundstate @xmath122 .",

    "by definition , the concurrences of lke and iie introduced in the main text , @xmath67 and @xmath81 , are always non - zero ( but @xmath123 ) when the respective correlation function @xmath124 or @xmath125 . based on the exact solutions",
    ", these functions can be reexpressed as @xmath126 where , @xmath127 , @xmath128 . therefore ,",
    "in the whole parameter regime @xmath129 , @xmath130 , or @xmath131 , we have @xmath132 thus @xmath67 and @xmath81 are both non - zero when @xmath133 . in this co - existence regime",
    "where @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 this is a sum rule constraining the variations of @xmath67 and @xmath81 : @xmath136 in this regime .    as an inference of the sum rule",
    ", we note that a werner state with @xmath137 has the nonlocal correlation characteristic , i.e. , violation of the bell inequality@xcite .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , we have an entanglement monogamy : @xmath81 and @xmath67 can not simultaneously maximize , nor even simultaneously fall into this region .",
    "in other words , only one of the entanglements could be maximized or violate the bell inequality .",
    "finally , one can also define the entanglement between the spin @xmath4 and @xmath139 , i.e. , the cross kondo entanglement , quantified by @xmath140 .",
    "owing to the discrete symmetry mentioned previously , this quantity can be drived similar to @xmath81 , obtaining @xmath141 .",
    "so @xmath140 is non - zero only when @xmath142 .",
    "this region is a subregion of the lke phase , below the straight line connecting ( @xmath143 ) and the @xmath10-point(not shown in fig.[diagram ] ) . hence including @xmath140",
    "does not violate the previous sum rule .",
    "moreover , another sum rule @xmath144 holds in this subregion .",
    "therefore the previous inference as well as all the conclusions in the main text remain valid in the whole phase diagram .",
    "as we emphasized , the quantum entanglement related to the single - ion kondo effect is complicated when two or more local magnetic impurities are introduced .",
    "we have considered the lke in the case of two magnetic impurities where a quantum phase transition from the kondo to the afm singlets takes place .",
    "the exact results obtained from a simplified yet effective tikm , i.e. , the rs spin model , show a phase diagram involving several regimes corresponding to non zero lke and iie , and their co - existence . with increasing frustrated cross coupling the co - existence regime shrinks and vanishes at the critical point @xmath10 where the groundstate @xmath145 has a discontinuity accompanied by jumps in the iie and lke .",
    "the discontinuity of such quantities at the critical point may be a generic feature caused by the non - extensive impurity term in the free energy of the tikm@xcite .",
    "due to the entanglement sum rule , the lke and iie can not be simultaneously maximized even in the co - existence regime .",
    "because an entangled state with non - zero concurrence while still keeping the bell - chsh inequality@xcite can be used for quantum information processing including quantum teleportation@xcite , the singlet groundstate in the co - existence phase shares this feature either by the lke or iie , and thus should be an interesting candidate state for quantum information processing .",
    "it is interesting to understand implications of our present study for more generic kondo lattice models . in these systems , like the heavy fermion metals , the magnetic quantum phase transitions may be influenced by the variation of kondo effect .",
    "a local quantum phase transition is possible in more generic kondo lattice phase diagram where the criticality is associated with a critical breakdown of the single - ion kondo effect@xcite . near the critical point",
    ", the hall constant shows a discontinuous jump due to the reconstruction of the fermi surface across the critical point@xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for this scenario comes from several prototypes of heavy fermion metals including ybrh@xmath146si@xmath146@xcite and ceniaso@xcite where the observed hall constant exhibits a sudden change accompanying the magnetic phase transition .",
    "although the above scenario could be naturally understood based on the kondo entanglement picture , a lattice model hamiltonian with exact solutions showing the kondo entanglement breakdown transition is lacking .",
    "thus our studied model can serve as a toy model to understand its basic physics from the quantum entanglement perspective . on the one hand",
    ", one expects that with the evolution from two impurities to an regular local moment lattice , the kondo singlet and inter - impurity afm singlet states evolve into the paramagnetic heavy fermion and afm ordered phases , respectively . on the other hand , in addition to the rkky interaction , the crossing kondo coupling ( @xmath8 ) emerges as a many - body frustration effect and plays a role in controlling the transition . generally , in the regime with relatively small @xmath8 ,",
    "the kondo and inter - impurity singlets can co - exist in the intermediate regime of @xmath2 .",
    "the co - existence regime diminishes with increasing @xmath8 and a direct kondo singlet breakdown transition takes place when the kondo coupling is maximally frustrated ( at @xmath11 ) . in the kondo lattice phase diagram",
    "this condition should correspond to the regime with strong geometric frustrations and quantum fluctuations but no spin liquid phase sets in@xcite .",
    "finally , extending the present study to the kondo lattice cases with frustrated cross couplings or various anisotropic interactions is not an easy task but highly desirable .",
    "nevertheless , our present result already provides a concrete example of kondo breakdown quantum phase transition from the quantum entanglement perspective .",
    "one of the authors ( j.d . ) would like to thank rong - qiang he , zhong - yi lu , and qimiao si for useful discussions .",
    "he especially thanks rong - qiang he and zhong - yi lu for identifying the nature of discontinuity of the inter - impurity spin - spin correlation function .",

    "the local kondo entanglement ( lke ) refers to the quantum entanglement of a local kondo pair consisting of an impurity fixed spin @xmath157 and its spatially nearby conduction electron .",
    "as we focus on the spin degrees of freedom relevant in the kondo screening , such a pair of spins is dubbed as a local kondo state .",

    ", the lke is measured by the concurrence of @xmath167 . because @xmath167 can be reexpressed as @xmath187 .",
    "the the concurrence of this state is given by@xcite @xmath188 such entanglement can be also measured by the negativity@xcite of the reduced density matrix , @xmath189 .",
    "it is straightforwardly seen that the negativity of the werner state is equal to the concurrence@xcite , i.e. , @xmath190 .",

    "parallel to the lke , such the inter - impurity entanglement ( iie ) measured by the concurrence ( @xmath67 ) is closely related to the spin - spin correlation function @xmath192 .",
    "this quantity varies monotonically with the rkky interaction @xmath193 .",
    "the _ indirect _ rkky interaction , i.e. , the coupling between the local moments which is not explicitly present in the bare hamiltonian , is generated in the second order perturbtion in @xmath75 and dependend on the density of states at the fermi energy and the spatial separation @xmath194 of the two local moments .",
    "because @xmath193 oscillates non - universally , the iie s of different pairs @xmath195 are usually complicated .",
    "remarkably , there are two special situations where the iie competes with the lke : ( i ) the two impurity case with @xmath196 ; ( ii ) the sites @xmath149 and @xmath197 are the nearest - neighboring sites in the kondo lattice with @xmath198 ( @xmath199 the total number of sites ) .",
    "therefore , the competition between the lke and iie manifests the competition between the kondo singlet and the inter - impurity afm singlet in the tikm , or manifests the competition between the paramagnetic heavy fermion state and the afm ordered state in the kondo lattices .",
    "a phenomenological understanding of above competition invokes two energy scales , the single - ion kondo temperature @xmath200 $ ] , and the rkky interaction @xmath2 , with @xmath201 the band width and @xmath202 the density of states at the fermi energy . in the renormalization group treatment one approaches the low energy limit by gradually integrating out the degrees of freedom of conduction electrons . so that at @xmath203 , the latter can be introduced by adding a _ direct _ rkky term @xmath204 into the original hamiltonian , while the single - ion kondo screening effect is described by a term @xmath205 .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath1 is the excitation energy of the kondo triplet above the kondo singlet groundstate .",
    "the effective cross kondo coupling ( denoted by @xmath8 in the main text ) between @xmath191 and @xmath159 can be also induced by pure quantum mechanical many - body processes .",
    "proper inter - impurity distance and the direct rkky interaction guarantee the required particle - hole symmetry@xcite .",
    "these interpretations provide a basis for the rs spin model as a minimal fixed point hamiltonian of the tikm .",
    "the sixteen eigenstates ( each up to a normalization factor ) and the corresponding eigenvalues are solved as following : @xmath206                          in above , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 . along the line @xmath47 or @xmath224 , some coefficients are divergent , but the correct forms can be obtained by taking the limits from either sides . in particular , in the vicinity of the singular point @xmath102 , the wavefunctions are determined unambiguously by taking the limits at @xmath10 approached from either sides along the line @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath47 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , we have the normalized state @xmath227.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while when @xmath47 , @xmath228 , @xmath226 , we have @xmath229.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath230 .",
    "this result demonstrates a discontinuity of the groundstate wavefunction across the singular point .",
    "there are two types of particle - hole symmetry in the tikm with lattice inversion symmetry , depending on the inter - impurity distance being even or odd lattice spacing , respectively .",
    "usually , only the first type with even inter - impurity distance is the required symmetry which may guarantee a critical point with groundstate degeneracy@xcite . as an effective spin - only model , eq.([h1 ] )",
    "does not show such distinction for even / odd inter - impurity distance .",
    "instead , the required groundstate degeneracy can arise by tuning the cross kondo coupling , see the following discussions .",
    "the discontinuity in the first derivative of negativity usually comes from the requirement of nonnegative concurrence@xcite .",
    "its relation with a true quantum phase transition should be further corroborated by checking the nonanalyticity of groundstate energy or groundstate wavefunction .      in a spin chain model with two magnetic impurites several impurity - related entanglement quantities measured by the negativity display detectable features in their derivatives at the quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "these quantities do not exhibit apparant variation of the kondo effect across the transition .",
    "more recently , the schmidt gap has been proposed as an order parameter measuring the impurity quantum phase transitions@xcite ."
