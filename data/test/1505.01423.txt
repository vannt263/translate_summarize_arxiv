    "coalescing binary neutron stars ( bnss ) and neutron star - black hole ( ns - bh ) binaries are not only among the most promising candidates for direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) with upcoming ground - based interferometers such as advanced ligo and virgo @xcite . the accretion of a remnant torus around a bh formed promptly after merger also represents the leading scenario to explain the formation of a short gamma - ray burst ( sgrb ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the recent discovery of long - lasting x - ray afterglows ( referred to as `` extended emission '' and `` x - ray plateaus '' ; e.g. , @xcite ) in the vast majority of sgrb events observed by the _ swift _",
    "satellite @xcite indicate ongoing energy injection on timescales of up to @xmath1 , which are incompatible with the short accretion timescale of a remnant torus ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these x - ray afterglows can , however , be interpreted by assuming that the merger leads to the formation of a long - lived , rapidly rotating ns ( a millisecond magnetar ; henceforth referred to as the `` magnetar model '' ; e.g. , @xcite ) . despite individual differences in the phenomenology , different variants of the magnetar model",
    "have in common that they postulate the formation of a _ uniformly _ rotating , highly magnetized ns and that at least the late - time x - ray emission is powered by dipole spin - down radiation , which requires an essentially baryon - free environment around the ns .",
    "the magnetar model challenges the ns - bh progenitor channel for sgrbs , since a magnetar can not be formed in this case , and we are thus led to consider bns mergers as the main formation channel .",
    "the outcome of a bns merger depends on the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities , which is unknown .",
    "however , the recent discovery of high - mass neutron stars @xcite indicate a maximum mass for stable nss of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the mass distribution of bnss is peaked around @xmath4 and this yields an approximate mass of the merger remnant of @xmath5 @xcite . combining this with the fact that uniform rotation can centrifugally support nss against gravitational collapse up to masses of @xmath6 @xcite , merger remnants are very likely supramassive .",
    "if the merger remnant is only slightly hypermassive ( i.e. above the maximum mass for uniformly rotating nss ) , it can still migrate to a supramassive star by mass loss through early winds while still supported by differential rotation ( see below ) .",
    "supramassive nss are typically long - lived and the exact lifetime depends on the timescale to remove a significant fraction of the rotational energy ( e.g. , via dipole spin down ) .",
    "hence , it is conceivable that in the vast majority of bns mergers a long - lived ns is formed , which supports the magnetar model .    from simulations",
    "it is known , however , that at early times the bns merger remnant is characterized by a high degree of differential rotation and thus substantial magnetic field rearrangement and amplification .",
    "these conditions are very different from pure dipole spin down of a uniformly rotating magnetar , as assumed in most magnetar models .",
    "this leads us to investigate this early phase of a differentially rotating bns merger remnant by fully general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we elaborate here on recent results of such simulations @xcite , which revealed the generation of a very dense , highly magnetized wind that carries sufficient poynting flux to explain typical luminosities of early x - ray afterglows .",
    "the present paper focuses on discussing the wind properties in more detail and its implications for sgrbs and their x - ray afterglows .",
    "employing the general - relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamics code whiskymhd @xcite combined with the publicly available einstein toolkit and its spacetime evolution code mclachlan @xcite , models of hypermassive neutron stars constructed with the rns code @xcite were evolved , which we endowed with different initial magnetic field geometries ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "these models are representative of the typical outcome of a bns merger , once the merger remnant has settled down to a roughly axisymmetric state and assuming that the merger has not led to a prompt collapse to a bh . here",
    ", we elaborate , in particular , on model ` rand ` of @xcite , which has a `` random '' initial magnetic field geometry inside and outside the star and which we consider to most closely resemble the actual magnetic field geometry resulting from a bns merger .",
    "it is important to stress that our conclusions in this paper and that of @xcite mostly depend on differential rotation and thus also apply to differentially rotating supramassive nss ( which together with hypermassive ns are the most likely result of bns mergers , see section  [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "the early evolution of a differentially rotating bns merger remnant is characterized by magnetic winding : poloidal magnetic fields in the interior of the star are `` wound up '' , producing a strong toroidal component and enhancing the magnetic pressure .",
    "rotational energy is thus converted into magnetic energy .",
    "we find that within a few average rotational periods , the increase of magnetic pressure in the surface layers of the star is sufficient to overcome the gravitational binding of material in the vicinity of the stellar surface .",
    "this results in a highly magnetized , highly isotropic and very dense wind of matter from the ns that heavily pollutes the environment with baryons ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : wind2d ] ) .",
    "this environment of the ns is very different from an essentially baryon - fee pulsar wind that is usually hypothesized in magnetar models .    a global measure of the baryon pollution",
    "is depicted in the rightmost panel of figure  [ fig : rho_vel ] , which shows the total mass crossing a coordinate sphere of radius @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the centre of the star per unit time during the evolution of the simulation .",
    "the wind at these distances is still rather turbulent during the later part of the evolution , which results in a noisy mass - loss rate .",
    "nevertheless , the mass - loss rates as measured at different distances from the star roughly agree and yield a stationary mass - loss rate of a few in @xmath9 solar masses per second ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the morphology of the wind is depicted in the left and middle panel of figure  [ fig : rho_vel ] in terms of the rest - mass density profiles .",
    "the directionally averaged profiles at different times ( e.g. , at 50ms and 60ms ) agree very well up to the outer radius of the bulk of the ejected matter at that particular time .",
    "a fit to these profiles reveals a characteristic average wind density profile @xmath11 that is constant in time .",
    "according to mass conservation , we have at fixed radius @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the amount of mass inside the volume of radius @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the radial velocity of the wind at time @xmath16 and radius @xmath14 . combining @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 thus yields @xmath19 , i.e. an overall bulk speed of the wind that is constant in time and space .",
    "assuming @xmath20 ( see above and figure  [ fig : rho_vel ] ) , we obtain a subrelativistic wind expansion speed for the model considered , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the speed of light .",
    "although the mass - loss rate is roughly constant during the timescale of up to 60ms that we can access through our simulations , it is expected to change significantly at later times .",
    "the timescale for a change of @xmath23 and thus for a change of the wind properties depends on the timescale for removal of differential rotation ( see section  [ sec : consequences ] ) .",
    "furthermore , neutrinos radiated from the hot interior of the ns can heat and drive an outflow from the surface of the ns and thus lead to additional mass loss ( e.g. , @xcite ) . depending on the magnetic field strength and the rotation period",
    ", however , the magnetically - driven wind discussed here may well be the dominant process for mass loss .",
    "the poynting flux associated to the magnetically - driven wind in our simulations corresponds to stationary electromagnetic ( em ) luminosities @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average magnetic field strength in the outer layers of the star once the system has reached its stationary state , @xmath26 denotes the equatorial radius , and @xmath27 is the ( central ) spin period @xcite .",
    "this relation is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the initial magnetic field geometry and it is different from dipole spin - down emission considered in the magnetar model , in which case @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the dipolar field strength at the pole . assuming that only a small fraction @xmath30 of the luminosity ( equation  [ eq : luminosity ] ) is converted into x - rays , the observed x - ray luminosities @xmath31 of extended emission and x - ray plateaus of sgrbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) are obtained by magnetic field strengths @xmath32 , which are likely produced during and after a bns merger @xcite .",
    "the timescale over which the baryon - loaded wind and its associated em luminosity can be sustained depends on the timescale for removal of differential rotation and is uncertain .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate is provided by the alfvn timescale @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath33 for the magnetic fields considered here and which is in agreement with an estimate @xmath34 for the timescale of change of the angular velocity profile in our simulations .",
    "differential rotation is completely removed within a few to several of these timescales .",
    "the overall duration of the process as well as the luminosities mentioned above are compatible with the observed extended emission of sgrbs ( lasting @xmath35 ) and thus make the magnetically - driven wind a promising alternative model to explain such emission .",
    "the prompt sgrb emission is thought to be collimated and thus beamed away from us in the vast majority of events .",
    "furthermore , the observed sgrb rate within the sensitivity volume of advanced ligo and virgo is very small ( @xmath36 @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , identifying potential isotropic em emission from bns mergers is of utmost importance .",
    "the isotropic em emission found here potentially represents such an important counterpart to the gw signal of bns mergers .",
    "although the initial phase of differential rotation of the bns merger remnant is rather short , the total amount of mass lost via the magnetically - driven wind can be substantial .",
    "the ejected matter creates an optically thick environment that will likely affect the emission properties of the system in the following evolution , once the star has settled down to uniform rotation . at this stage ,",
    "the ns might lose rotational energy via spin - down radiation , and the resulting x - ray afterglow radiation would be the product of a reprocessing of this radiation by the confining envelope of ejecta matter ( cf .",
    "the associated spectrum could carry such a signature , e.g. , thermalization of ( part of ) the non - thermal spin - down emission by the optically thick ejecta material .    as the presence of a magnetically - driven wind only depends on differential rotation , which is generic to bns merger remnants ,",
    "the associated baryon pollution in the polar regions is also generally expected .",
    "this severely hampers the production of a relativistic jet through accretion of a remnant torus around the newly formed ns .",
    "hence , if the presence of long - lasting x - ray afterglows requires a long - lived ns remnant , an alternative explanation for the generation of the sgrb itself is likely required .",
    "such a scenario that explains the production of long - lasting x - ray afterglows and the prompt sgrb emission in a common phenomenology has recently been proposed @xcite ( for an alternative proposal , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , full simulations of bns mergers will be needed in the future to better characterize the magnetically - driven wind .",
    "these simulations will also help to shed light on whether or not a relativistic jet can be launched at the merger of a bns system forming a long - lived ns .",
