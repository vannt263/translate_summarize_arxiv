    "the importance of neutrinos in the explosions of massive stars has long been recognized .",
    "this significance is coupled with their ability to carry information to us about the processes and conditions in the core of the supernova so that the neutrino signal from the next galactic supernova will provide us with an opportunity to test the core collapse paradigm .",
    "the explosion begins when the runaway process of electron capture in the core a massive star leads to a rapid compression and collapse that is only halted when the degenerate pressure of the neutrons and thermal pressure of non - degenerate particles kicks in at super - nuclear densities .",
    "the rapid neutronization during the collapse leads to a large burst of @xmath0 neutrinos that identifies the beginning of the event . as nuclear densities",
    "are reached the mean free path of the neutrinos becomes shorter than the size of the proto - neutron star and the neutrinos become trapped .",
    "thermal processes within the core create a thermal bath of neutrino - antineutrino pairs of all flavors .",
    "the neutrinos slowly diffuse from the core over a period of order @xmath1 seconds , carrying 99% of the gravitational binding energy of the core with them .",
    "with such a large neutrino luminosity even a small number of neutrino interactions above the core can create an important impact on the explosion physics .",
    "detection of the neutrinos from the next nearby supernova will offer us the opportunity to examine the internal evolution of the explosion since the neutrinos allow us to see down all the way to the proto - neutron star .",
    "for example , if the proto - neutron star collapses to a black hole , the resulting neutrino signal will be altered @xcite .",
    "in addition , although these neutrinos are only weakly interacting they can have significant effects upon the nucleosynthesis that occurs in the supernova : in the outer layers of the star neutrinos can cause a transformation of the elements synthesized during the preceding thermonuclear burning period in the `` neutrino process '' @xcite , it is thought that a neutrino driven wind occurs at late time in the supernova which may create sufficiently neutron rich material to produce the r - process elements @xcite , and long duration gamma ray bursts ( which are thought to be a rare type of supernova ) produce elements in conditions governed by strong neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "the results of all these nucleosynthesis processes are quite sensitive to the neutrino spectra @xcite .    for reasons pertaining to both hydrodynamics and to element synthesis",
    "it is important to understand the details of neutrino propagation in the supernova and the mixing between neutrino flavors .",
    "neutrino oscillations also alter what we observe but , simultaneously , also allow the possibly of elucidating yet unknown neutrino oscillation physics , e.g. @xcite .",
    "supernova neutrino flavor transformation is a rapidly developing field with the neutrino background terms the subject of intense study @xcite .",
    "realistic possibilities include a complete mixing of all flavors @xcite or a partial oscillation between flavors @xcite .",
    "an important part of any future observation of supernova neutrinos will be to understand this physics . in parallel , phase effects due to multiple resonances",
    "have recently been recognized @xcite distorting the simple picture of neutrino propagation through the outer layers of the supernova that has been used in the past @xcite .",
    "the explosion of the star leads to an evolution of the flavor mixing so that to appreciate the effects upon neutrino propagation it is important to understand the density profile .",
    "observations of high pulsar velocities and polarized supernova light suggest an inherent asymmetry in the explosion mechanism .",
    "though many possible mechanisms for generating the asymmetry have been proposed , recent work by blondin , mezzacappa & demarino @xcite has identified an instability of the standing accretion shock that leads to large dipole and quadrupole moments .",
    "more recent work by blondin & mezzacappa @xcite and ohnishi , kotake , and yamada @xcite as well as scheck _",
    "@xcite has both confirmed and furthered the understanding of this instability .",
    "an alternative mechanism , acoustic heating , has also been discussed by burrows et al . @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the neutrino flavor mixing and the subsequent variation of the neutrino signal means that it may be possible to to detect prominent features of the supernova density profile and to use this information to learn important information about the explosion .",
    "this possibility was demonstrated first by schirato and fuller @xcite who used a time - dependent , one - dimensional @xmath2 density profile to demonstrate that the supernova s forward shock wave reaches and disrupts the ` h ' resonance transformation layer a few seconds after the core bounce leading to a detectable change in the charged current neutrino signal .",
    "this was followed and elaborated upon by dighe & smirnov @xcite , takahashi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and fogli _ et al .",
    "more recently tom ` as _",
    "@xcite used a more sophisticated numerical model of a progenitor star to investigate the effect of both forward and reverse shocks on the neutrino signal .",
    "tom ` as _ et al .",
    "_ also present one second of a two - dimensional simulation result to show how the density profile can be greatly complicated by a deformed forward shock followed by strong convection currents . but",
    "due to the intensive computational burden of supernova models it is numerically very taxing to to watch these the explosion propagate outward until they affect neutrino transformations .    in this paper",
    "we present calculations which link hydrodynamical simulations of time dependent density profiles and phase - retaining neutrino oscillations .",
    "our presentation begins in section [ section : simulations ] with the results from simulations of supernovae in both one and two dimensions where we artificially heat a density profile constructed so as to mimic the state of the supernova at the point where the accretion shock has stalled .",
    "our two - dimensional explosions are heated aspherically so as to create an aspherical supernova .",
    "though this 2d model lacks some structural features present in more sophisticated models that generate asphericity via standing accretion shock instabilities , we still obtain results that give a good idea of how density isotropy affects neutrino flavor transformations . in section iii",
    "we pass a spectrum of neutrinos through the simulation results and show how the crossing probability is affected by the evolution of the profiles .",
    "we finish in section iv by presenting our calculation of two neutrino detector signals - the positron spectra within a water cerenkov detector , and the ratio of charged current to neutral current event rates for a heavy water detector - that demonstrate our ability to extract information about the supernova .",
    "our first task in determining the neutrino signal is to simulate the supernova so as to obtain the time evolution of the density profile . a supernova simulation is a complex and computationally intensive problem . at the present time",
    "there is not yet a robust , self - consistent model for core - collapse supernovae , and the most sophisticated multi - dimensional simulations take a very long time to compute .",
    "but we do not need to simulate the actual core collapse and formation of the proto - neutron star , these events occur deep within the core at a radius of @xmath3 or so , whereas the first neutrino resonance occurs at around @xmath4 for neutrino energies of order @xmath5 , and the second is even further out",
    ". what is occurring in the core is irrelevant for our purposes , all we need from the simulation of the supernova is the propagation of the shock through the star .",
    "for this reason we employ a simplistic and artificially energetic numerical simulation to create explosions with a range of features that might be present in reality .",
    "we do not intend this model to be realistic itself , but rather a tool to help with the difficult problem of reconstructing density features of an exploding star based on changing neutrino signals detected at earth .",
    "we use vh-1 @xcite , a hydrodynamic code based on woodward and colella s @xcite piecewise parabolic method . for both the one - dimensional and two - dimensional simulations we employ an exponentially coarsening radial grid that ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radius from the center of the star , and for the two - dimensional simulations an angular grid that ranges from @xmath9 to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the polar angle .",
    "the innermost radial grid increment is set to @xmath12 and increases by 1.3% thereafter .",
    "by @xmath13 the radial increment has grown to @xmath14 and by @xmath15 we reach @xmath16 .",
    "we map into the code a spherically symmetric progenitor profile intended to represent the state of the supernova about @xmath17 after the collapse .",
    "beyond @xmath18 the profile is that of a low metallicity , @xmath19 progenitor model developed by heger et al @xcite that we have allowed to collapse further within vh-1 so that the infall velocities approached free fall .",
    "interior to @xmath20 we splice in a slow , outward - moving standing accretion shock profile provided by heywood @xcite that is similar to that found in @xcite .",
    "finally , inside @xmath21 we insert a dense , @xmath22 , polytropic core containing approximately @xmath23 .",
    "the inner boundary condition inside the dense core at @xmath24 is reflecting .",
    "figure ( [ fig:1da ] ) shows the full initial density profile .",
    "the initial , @xmath25 , density profile used in our sn simulations .",
    "the dense core ( a ) inside @xmath26 contains approximately @xmath23 .",
    "the slow , outward - moving standing accretion shock ( b ) is located at @xmath27 . above that we have a collapsing , @xmath19 , progenitor ( c).,width=480 ]    to drive the explosion , we mimic neutrino heating by inserting energy into the region above a @xmath28 gain radius .",
    "the energy deposition rate per unit volume , @xmath29 , is proportional to the density of material , falls as @xmath30 and decreases exponentially with time @xmath31 over a timescale @xmath32 set to @xmath33 .",
    "for the 1d simulations then , @xmath34 the additional factors of @xmath35 and @xmath31 are inserted so as to ramp up the energy deposition over both distance and time thereby avoiding the violent disruption that occurs if we deposit energy either too suddenly or within a small volume .",
    "for the 2d models we introduce an angular dependence into the energy deposition prescription so as to match the observation by blondin _",
    "_ @xcite that small perturbations in standing accretion shock models can ultimately lead to aspherical shock modes .",
    "we break the spherical symmetry of our 2d simulations by heating the initial profile with a combination of 75% spherical mode heating and 25% @xmath36 mode heating .",
    "thus for the 2d cases @xmath29 becomes @xmath37 in either case the total energy , @xmath38 , input during the simulation was recorded .",
    "below the gain radius we wish to maintain the spherical density / gravity conditions and to prevent mass from escaping the core so that we do not disturb the shock heating and convective flow in the outer star . in a real supernova the core is stabilized by neutrino emission but in lieu of full implementation of this cooling mechanism our simulations achieve the same result by forcing all radial and angular velocities below @xmath39 to zero . in this way we separate the evolution of the outer layers of the star from the complex behavior near the core .",
    "the runtime of the 1d simulations is sufficiently short that we can vary the total energy deposition thereby obtaining a variety of results ranging from weak explosions through to the very powerful .",
    "the 2d simulations take much longer to run and so we have just one data set with an explosion energy set to @xmath40 .    before presenting our simulation results",
    "we mention that in general , numerical schemes tend to spread the shock front over several zones and they therefore become artificially softened .",
    "schirato and fuller @xcite account for this artifact by steepening by hand the density profile at the shocks .",
    "the shocks in our simulations are sufficiently steep to demonstrate the primary effect on neutrino mixing , therefore we do not implement a similar correction .",
    "the density profiles of the sn we obtain from the simulations possess noticeable differences as the energy deposition changes . for weak explosions the profiles are monotonically decreasing functions of the radius , @xmath8 , with a single , forward facing , shock front that moves relatively slowly outwards . as the deposition energy increases a lower - density cavity forms behind the shock .",
    "further increases in @xmath38 eventually lead to the formation of a reverse shock behind the lower - density zone .",
    "all three features are present in the results of the 2d simulations but the higher dimensionality , coupled with the aspherical heating means , that this sn possesses a much more turbulent / chaotic profile .     the density as a function of the radius and angle in a 2d sn model at @xmath41 .",
    "the forward shock is located to the left of ` a ' , the reverse shock is the step - up in density found to the right of ` b ' , and one of the many local cavities in the profile between the shocks is to the right of ` c'.,width=480 ]    in figure ( [ fig : rho.snv2d.t=2.5 ] ) we show a time slice of the 2d sn simulation .",
    "the forward shock is seen at ` a ' , the ` reverse shock ' is at ` b ' and one of the many bubbles in the density profile is located at ` c ' .",
    "we note that although our applied neutrino heating is symmetric about the equator ( @xmath42 ) the resulting density profile is not .",
    "we attribute this to the inherent instability of multi - dimensional accretion shocks , potentially excited by simulation numerics . in what follows",
    "we discuss the behavior and properties of the various features of the profile .",
    "the forward shock is a generic feature of supernovae simulations .",
    "a stalled forward shock was present in the initial profile inserted into the hydrodynamical code and the heating we introduced was meant to revive it s outward motion . after revival the shock propagates out through the star and is the explosion feature furthest from the proto - neutron star .",
    "the forward shock is visible in figure ( [ fig : rho.snv2d.t=2.5 ] ) as the large jump in density at larger radii and we note that the forward shock in the 2d simulation is slightly oblate due to the aspherical heating of the material .",

    "but even though the remainder of the neutrinos survive the passage through the material overlying the proto - neutron star what emerges is not the same as what was emitted .",
    "the change in the neutrinos is due to neutrino oscillations and the presence of matter modulates this mixing .",
    "neutrino oscillations arise due to a distinction between the interaction eigenstates ( otherwise known as the flavor eigenstates @xmath81 ) and the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian ( known as the mass eigenstates ) with masses @xmath82 .",
    "since there are three basis states a general neutrino wavefunction is described by three complex coefficients and evolves according to the schrodinger equation . in the vacuum",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonal in the mass basis but possesses off - diagonal terms in the flavor basis that are the cause of flavor oscillations . in the presence of matter a potential , @xmath83 , that takes into account coherent forward scattering of the neutrinos , is included in the hamiltonian . since we are only concerned with mixing between active neutrino flavors ( i.e. all the flavors that have ordinary weak interactions ) we may subtract off the common neutral current contribution ( which will contribute only an overall phase ) leaving just the charged current contribution to the @xmath84 component of @xmath83 .",
    "this contribution is the well - known @xmath85 where @xmath86 is fermi s constant , @xmath87 is the mass density , @xmath88 is the electron fraction and @xmath89 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the effect of the matter upon the antineutrinos differs from that of the neutrinos - the potential @xmath90 that appears in the antineutrino hamiltonian has the same magnitude but the opposite sign . due to the inclusion of @xmath91",
    "the hamiltonian is a function of position and is neither diagonal in the mass basis nor the flavor basis .",
    "one may try and diagonalize @xmath92 but the unitary transformation that relates the flavor basis to the new ` matter ' basis also varies with the position .",
    "consequently the gradient of the unitary transformation is non - zero and one finds that the schrodinger equation in this new matter basis - that was meant to diagonalize @xmath93 - picks up off - diagonal terms .",
    "thus it is not possible , in general , to find a basis that diagonalizes the hamiltonian and therefore oscillations of the amplitudes that describe the wavefunction occur in every basis .    in general , the three complex components of the wavefunction oscillate simultaneously .",
    "exactly what occurs depends upon the energy of the neutrino @xmath94 , the differences between the squares of the masses @xmath82 , the mixing angles that describe the relationship between the flavor and mass basis , and , of course , @xmath91 .",
    "since there are three mass eigenstates there are three separate mass splittings @xmath95 ( though only two are independent ) and the relationship between the neutrino flavor and mass bases is described by the matrix @xmath96 which , in turn , is parameterized by three mixing angles @xmath97 and @xmath98 plus a cp - phase @xmath99 .",
    "the structure of @xmath96 is @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "mixing has been observed in the neutrinos emitted by the sun and the neutrinos produced by cosmic rays striking the atmosphere . both have been confirmed with terrestrial experiments .",
    "each observation of neutrino mixing can be described by a single @xmath103 - @xmath11 pair of parameters and experimentally the ` solar ' and ` atmospheric ' mass splittings differ by around a factor of @xmath104 with the solar mass splitting , @xmath105 , being the smaller of the two .",
    "this observation permits us to consider the evolution of the general , three component , neutrino wavefunction as being factored into spatially distinct , two - neutrino mixes .",
    "the factorization simplifies matters greatly and from it one can demonstrate that there are two resonances in the supernova density profile : the so - called ` l ' resonance and the ` h ' resonance .",

    "furthermore , neutrino self interactions - described in samuel @xcite , pastor , raffelt & semikoz @xcite and friedland & lunardini @xcite - in the region immediately above the proto - neutron star can alter the spectra after it s emission from the proto - neutron star but before the flux reaches the h resonance layer .",

    "in each panel of the two figures the pinch parameter was set to @xmath246 , other than a change in shape the general behavior of the curves at other values of @xmath154 is unchanged .",

    "the crossing can be seen best in the @xmath255 spectrum in the normal hierarchy .",
    "we define the energies where the curves cross as the critical energies .",
    "the critical energies vary with both flavor and the hierachy . at the critical energy for a particular hiearachy and flavor the adiabaticity of the neutrinos",
    "as they propagate through the profile is irrelevant and the flux of that flavor and at that energy through a detector is independent of @xmath175 .",
    "the other significant feature to notice is the large difference between the two curves for the electron neutrinos and electron antineutrinos for energies below @xmath256 .",
    "this wide separation of the extremal fluxes at low to medium neutrino energies , @xmath257 , suggests that we focus our attention upon this portion of the spectrum because it is here that changes in adiabaticity will lead to the most significant changes in the flux .",
    "the flux at higher energies will also change with the evolving adiabaticity but to a lesser degree because the fluxes are so small .",
    "thus if the evolution of the neutrinos evolves from being adiabatic to non - adiabatic then , in the case of a normal hierarchy , the flux of electron neutrinos will increase for those energies below the critical energy and decrease above .",
    "similar behavior will occur for antineutrinos in the inverted hierarchy .",
    "the decrement above the critical energy is difficult to see in the figures because the critical energies are all far into the tail of the spectra . for the @xmath258 neutrino",
    "fluxes the opposite change occurs : a transition to non - adiabaticity leads to lower fluxes of these flavors at energies below the critical energy and higher fluxes above .",
    "having determined the effects of the evolving density profile upon the neutrino mixing we are now in a position to examine the actual neutrino signal within a detector .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : pfcp ] , the actual neutrino flux of a particular flavor through a detector differs from that emitted from the neutrinosphere . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "if the neutrinos propagate through the outer layers of the sn adiabatically then the survival probabilities @xmath259 and @xmath260 are found by setting @xmath261 in equations ( [ eq : ppbarnh ] ) and ( [ eq : ppbarih ] ) . for the normal hierarchy @xmath262 and @xmath263 : for the inverse hierarchy @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "using the value of @xmath266 we used to calculate @xmath175 and @xmath267 based upon the solar mixing parameters , we see that for the normal hierarchy the amount of the emitted @xmath268 flux present in the electron neutrino flux at a detector here on earth is minuscule . similarly we see that for an inverted hierarchy the amount of the emitted electron antineutrino flux present in any detected electron antineutrino flux is equally small .",
    "thus if the mass hierarchy is normal , @xmath269 is not too small , and the neutrino propagation adiabatic then the electron neutrino detectors on earth will essentially be detecting the emitted @xmath270 and @xmath271 flux . or",

    ", it will be very difficult to reconstruct the the @xmath268 or @xmath254 spectrum that was originally emitted from the proto - neutron star .",
    "the evolution of the density profile changes this conclusion . depending upon the scenario ,",
    "either @xmath259 ( for a normal hierarchy ) or @xmath260 ( for an inverted hierarchy ) will change with time and so the proportions of the emitted fluxes present in the fluxes at earth will also change .",
    "note that @xmath259 and @xmath260 do not both evolve with time within in the same scenario ; one will stay constant .",
    "this means there is a potential to separate the time evolution of the emitted flux from the neutrinosphere from the evolution of the density profile through which the neutrinos propagate .",

    "<S> using these results we demonstrate the time variation of the neutrino crossing probabilities due to changes in the msw neutrino transformations as the star explodes by using the s - matrix - monte carlo - approach to neutrino propagation . after adopting spectra for the neutrinos emitted from the proto - neutron star we calculate for a galactic supernova </S>",
