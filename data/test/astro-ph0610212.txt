    "standard star formation modes are thought to break down near a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , raising the question of whether or not star formation near a smbh is possible , and if so , through what mechanism @xcite .",
    "our own galaxy provides us with a unique opportunity to study individual stars in the presence of a smbh , namely , sgr  a*. direct observations of massive , and therefore young , stars close to sgr  a * indicate that there has been recent star formation at the galactic center @xcite .",
    "gcirs  16sw ( hereafter irs16sw ) is a variable source near the galactic center ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , j2000.0 ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the source is regularly variable and suggested that it could be a binary star with very massive components .",
    "@xcite confirmed the period of the object , but argued that the source was more likely a pulsating variable .",
    "recently , however , @xcite reported spectroscopic observations of irs16sw that showed radial velocity variations consistent with a binary composed of two massive stars",
    ".    prompted by the convincing nature of the radial velocity variations seen by @xcite we have re - analyzed the data presented by @xcite as well as additional data from the same observing campaign .",
    "we find that the original data reduction process was seriously flawed .",
    "in particular , the color variation , light - curve asymmetry , and sign of the brightness variations that @xcite  presented are artifacts of the data reduction process .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the re - analysis of the @xcite  data .",
    "we find that there is no color change in irs16sw over its variations and that the shape of the light curve is consistent with an eclipsing binary system .",
    "the new results are consistent with @xcite and confirm that irs16sw is a binary composed of two massive stars . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we describe the observations and present the data , in  [ sec : analysis ] we describe the best - fit model to the light - curve , and in  [ sec : conc ] we discuss and summarize the results .",
    "observations of the galactic center in the @xmath0 ( 1.6@xmath7 m ) and @xmath1 ( 2.2@xmath7 m ) bands were made at the cerro - tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio)/yale 1-m telescope using the facility optical / infrared imager ( andicam ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "andicam has a pixel scale of @xmath8  pix@xmath9 on a @xmath10 array .",
    "both @xmath0- and @xmath1-band images were taken in the 2001 and 2002 observing seasons ; @xmath0-band data were also obtained in 2000 .",
    "( the @xcite analysis includes only the 2001 data . ) the observing campaign consists of every usable night from utc 2000 august 13 ( hjd 2451769.5 ) through utc 2000 october 14 ( hjd 2451831.5 ) , utc 2001 may 20 ( hjd 2452049.5 ) through utc 2001 november 3 ( hjd 2452216.5 ) , and utc 2002 june 9 ( hjd 2452434.5 ) through utc 2002 september 25 ( hjd 2452542.5 ) .",
    "each night , a set of seven slightly offset images were obtained and then combined and trimmed to form a final nightly image .",
    "the @xmath0-band images consist of 30  s exposures , and it took about four minutes to obtain the group of seven images ; the @xmath1-band images consist of 10  s exposures and took about two minutes to obtain .    the final @xmath11 pixel images , corresponding to a field of view of @xmath12 arcseconds , are approximately centered on the galactic center .",
    "after image quality cuts were made , there are a total of 144 @xmath0-band and 137 @xmath1-band images .",
    "the seeing ranges from @xmath13 to @xmath14 full - width half maximum ; in general , the @xmath0-band images are of higher quality ( typical seeing @xmath15 ) than the @xmath1-band ( with typical seeing @xmath16 ) .",
    "because the field is crowded , we reduced the data using the isis difference image analysis package @xcite .",
    "this analysis revealed a sign error in the original @xcite reduction ; irs16sw is clearly an eclipsing binary .",
    "because irs16sw is subject to significant blending ",
    "there are roughly half a dozen sources in the @xcite catalog within about one arcsecond of irs16sw  we calibrated our light - curves with the @xcite data as presented by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite @xmath1-band photometry gives a mean magnitude of 0.2  mag higher than the @xcite mean , and includes two more seasons of data .",
    "@xcite  found a variability amplitude of 0.55  mag ; using daophot photometry to scale the isis fluxes , we find an amplitude of @xmath17  mag in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) .",
    "this substantial amplitude difference is indicative of significant blending in our data .",
    "we used the period of 19.45  days reported by @xcite and @xcite to scale our @xmath1-band light - curve to have the same mean magnitude and amplitude as the @xcite  data .",
    "there were 110 nights for which data were obtained in both the @xmath0- and @xmath1-bands , providing contemporaneous measurements of the @xmath18 color . using the daophot photometry , we find a constant @xmath18 color with an rms of 0.05  mag ; this color does not vary with time , phase , @xmath0- , or @xmath1-band magnitude , as shown in figure  [ fig : color ] .",
    "lacking properly calibrated @xmath0-band data , we scaled the similarly blended @xmath0-band data to have the same amplitude and mean magnitude as the @xmath1-band data .",
    "these scaled light - curves form the basis of our analysis ; table  [ tbl : data ] gives the final scaled time - series photometry .",
    "we simultaneously fit the 144 @xmath0-band and 184 @xmath1-band points ( including the @xcite  @xmath1-band points , except for two noisy points at hjd 2498704 and 2499908 ) using the october 2005 version of the wilson - devinney ( wd ) code @xcite in the overcontact mode ( mode 3 ) .",
    "we fixed @xmath19  k as estimated by @xcite and used the square - root limb darkening law , taking the values of the limb darkening coefficients from @xcite for a lte atlas9 @xcite stellar atmosphere model with @xmath20  k , @xmath21 ( cgs ) , turbulent velocity of 2  @xmath22 and solar metallicity .",
    "we fixed gravity brightening exponents and albedos to unity from theoretical values for stars at such temperatures .",
    "we assumed equal masses , circular orbits , and synchronous rotation , fitting for 7 parameters : the period @xmath23 , time of primary eclipse @xmath24 , inclination @xmath25 , @xmath26 , the luminosity of the primary in each band ( @xmath27 ) and the surface potential ( @xmath28 , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  1 ) ) .",
    "we defined convergence to be when the corrections for all adjusted parameters were smaller than their respective standard or statistical errors after three consecutive iterations .",
    "the best fit parameters are shown in table  [ tbl : wd ] .",
    "the ephemeris is @xmath29    a good fit required that the stars overfill their limiting roche lobes , which justifies using the overcontact mode of wd .",
    "@xcite adopted the largest filling factor allowed by nightfall ( 1.3 ) ; we calculate a larger fill - out factor ( as defined by @xcite ) of @xmath30 .",
    "the critical surface potentials for the inner and outer surfaces under the above assumptions are @xmath31 and @xmath32 . assuming different values for the mass ratio @xmath33 also produced good fits",
    ". however , a photometric mass ratio is not well constrained by our photometry ; therefore , we did not attempt to solve for it .",
    "the inclination we derive is @xmath34@xmath35 , in agreement with @xcite ; however , if there is still unaccounted for blending , then the inclination angle could be larger .    in figures  [ fig : lch ] and [ fig : lck ]",
    "we show the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band light curve model fit for irs16sw .",
    "the @xcite data are plotted with unfilled symbols in figure  [ fig : lck ] .",
    "error bars for our data are set to 0.04  mag , corresponding to the typical variation seen for a constant star of similar magnitude ( peeples et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the fact that the data are fit well under the assumption of circular orbits is an indication that this assumption is sound ; these data give no evidence for an eccentric orbit .",
    "the eccentricity of @xmath36 found by @xcite is derived from their radial velocity curve , which tends to yield nonzero eccentricities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the circularization time for a system with these physical characteristices ( discussed below ) is only tens of thousands of years @xcite , making it unlikely that we are observing irs16sw pre - circularization .    from the definition of @xmath37 ,",
    "wd calculates the following best fit fractional radii for both stars in units of the orbital separation : the polar radius , @xmath38 ; the radius in the plane of revolution and perpendicular to the line connecting the stars centers , @xmath39 , and the radius in the direction of l2 , @xmath40 . the orbital separation of @xcite , @xmath41 , yields physical radii of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the wd visualization for this system is shown in figure  [ fig : peanut ] .",
    "using kepler s law , @xcite find @xmath45 , placing the components of irs16sw among the most massive stars known . until recently ,",
    "the most massive stars measured in binaries were r136 - 38 in the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath46 , * ? ? ? * ) and wr  22 ( @xmath47 , @xcite , @xcite ) , an evolved star in our galaxy . the current heavyweight champion is a wolf - rayet binary , wr  20a ( 82 & 83 @xmath48 , @xcite , @xcite ) , in the young galactic cluster westerlund  2 .",
    "the luminosity of irs16sw poses a problem . using a radius of @xmath49 ( the mean radius given by wd for an orbital separation of @xmath50 ) and an effective temperature of @xmath51  k @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the luminosity @xmath52 of each component as @xmath53 .",
    "the non - sphericity of irs16sw will only drive this luminosity higher . for comparison ,",
    "the eddington luminosity of a @xmath54 star is @xmath55 .",
    "it is highly unlikely that each component of irs16sw has been radiating stably at nearly their eddington luminosities for eleven years @xcite ; the combined photometry of @xcite and this work span 19922002 .",
    "assuming the orbital separation as calculated by @xcite is correct ( if it is smaller , then @xmath56 will be even larger ) , this calculation implies that the temperature of @xcite is an over - estimate .",
    "a change in the assumed @xmath57 affects the wd model parameters ; specifically , a decrease in @xmath57 by a few thousand degrees kelvin will decrease the inclination angle @xmath25 , and thus increase the masses of the stars , by more than the formal @xmath58 uncertainties given by wd .    a radial velocity curve for the secondary is necessary to determine the value of the mass ratio @xmath33 .",
    "it remains a puzzle as to why irs16sw does not appear to be a double - line spectroscopic binary .",
    "it is readily apparent from the depths of the eclipses that the two stars have near - equal fluxes and from the depth ratio that they have near - equal surface brightnesses , yet @xcite see only one set of spectroscopic lines .",
    "however , since the spectral features used by @xcite are wind lines , with strong characteristic p  cygni profiles @xcite , differences in wind strength or small differences in the effective temperatures of the stars could easily conspire to make detection of the second set of lines difficult .",
    "we confirm that gcirs  16sw is a massive eclipsing binary with both stars overflowing their roche lobes .",
    "we find a refined orbital period of @xmath59  days and an inclination of 71@xmath35  with an assumed mass ratio of 1 , supporting the findings by @xcite that the masses of the two stars are both @xmath4 .",
    "the projected distance between irs16sw and sgr  a * is 0.05  pc @xmath60  au ( assuming a distance to the galactic center of 7.6  kpc , @xcite ) ; in fact , irs16sw is part of a moving group that is likely bound to sgr  a * @xcite . as the lifetime of @xmath54 stars is @xmath61  myr @xcite , these observations are strong evidence that irs16sw was formed within 0.1  pc of sgr  a * despite the tidal shear from the black hole which creates problems in star formation models .",
