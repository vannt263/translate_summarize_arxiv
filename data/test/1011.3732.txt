    "similarly , this transition has also been observed in a phase qubit coupled coherently to a two level fluctuator in the tunnel barrier of the josephson junction comprising the qubit @xcite and in molecular spectroscopy of two nearby molecules @xcite .",
    "it becomes visible only at the center of the avoided level crossing , again a manifestation of the symmetry properties of the system .",
    "the rate of the corresponding two - photon transition @xcite @xmath51 is given by a sum over the intermediate states @xmath52 .",
    "off the avoided crossing the qubits are effectively decoupled . in this case",
    "the intermediate states are @xmath53 .",

    "good qualitative agreement over a wide frequency range between the dispersive model and experimental data is obtained when taking spurious resonances of the coplanar waveguide in addition to the coplanar waveguide modes into account .",
    "hence , measurements of the transverse inter - qubit coupling can be employed to detect and investigate spurious global coupling channels between distant qubits , complementary to measurements of single qubit spectra used to detect spurious local resonances @xcite .",
    "how many higher harmonic modes to include in the theory , i.  e. where to set a high - frequency cut - off , can , however , not be decided on the basis of current measurements .",
    "in addition , we have observed dark states and enhanced two - photon absorption at the avoided level crossing in spectroscopic measurements .",
    "these characteristic features are based on the relation between the symmetry of the drive and the singlet and triplet states formed by the coupled qubits , which also explains the dark state at either the lower or higher energy branch .",
    "these symmetries also affect decay processes of singlet and triplet states and , together with the non - trivial environment formed by the microwave resonator , dissipative dynamics of separable and entangled states can be studied .",
    "the exchange coupling can also be useful for building two - qubit gates when fast flux - pulses are applied to tune the qubits into resonance . in the context of quantum information processing , the resulting swap gate forms a universal two - qubit gate with short operation times .",
