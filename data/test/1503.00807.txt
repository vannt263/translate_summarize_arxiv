    "the gaseous component of protoplanetary disks is crucial for understanding the planet formation process because it affects the structures and evolution of the disk via chemical reactions .",
    "theoretical studies have predicted that protoplanetary disks have multiple layers in their vertical direction due to stellar radiation .",
    "these include a relatively cool midplane , in which most of the molecules are depleted onto grains , a molecular - rich intermediate layer , and a hot surface layer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the physical environment differs among layers , gas phase abundances also vary significantly",
    "atomic carbon ( c ) is considered to be abundant in the disk surface where far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons drive the energy balance and gas chemistry , i.e. , the photon dominated region ( pdr ) .",
    "theoretical studies predict that in the pdr , fuv photons with energies less than the ionization energy of hydrogen ( 13.6 ev ) dissociate molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide ( co ) and ionize c to yield ionized carbon ( c@xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "when significant attenuation is achieved , a thin h / h@xmath9 transition layer should appear , beyond which hydrogen molecules dominate . because the ionization energy of c is 11.6 ev ,",
    "c@xmath8 is dominant at the lower density regions of the pdr .",
    "deeper to the pdr , the carbon - ionizing radiation is attenuated , and co forms via various chemical reactions . as a result , for the uniform pdr",
    ", c exists in a thin layer sandwiched between the c@xmath8 and co layers .    because photoevaporation at the disk surface is believed to govern the gas dispersal @xcite , observations of c are crucial for understanding disk dissipation .",
    "moreover , the observations of c are also important in terms of dust evolution in the disk because it affects the chemistry as a result of changes in the uv radiation field propagation and thus the intensity of the c line @xcite .",
    "however , detection of the submillimeter fine structure c lines has not been reported for protoplanetary disks thus far .",
    "although a few studies have attempted to detect the emission lines of c from protoplanetary disks around intermediate - mass stars , only upper limits have been obtained @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of [ c  i ] @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0p@xmath2 and @xmath10co @xmath3=43 observations with the band 8 qualification model receiver mounted on the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) , and report the first detection of [ c  i ] emission from a protoplanetary disk .",
    "we estimate the optical depth of the emission to derive the column density of c , and discuss possible evolutionary trends in the total mass of atomic c.",
    "we performed [ c  i ] @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0p@xmath2 ( 492.161 ghz ) and co @xmath1143 ( 461.041 ghz ) observations toward three classical t tauri stars ( ttss ) , , , and , in november 2010 using the aste .",
    "target information is listed in table [ tab : info ] . in addition , we made [ c  i ] observations toward two protostars ( pss ) in taurus , l1551 irs 5 and hl tau , to check the consistency of the observational data .",
    "we also used these data as a reference of the [ c  i ] intensity during the ps phase of star formation .",
    "the observations were taken with an alma band 8 ( 400500 ghz ) qualification model heterodyne receiver ( band 8 qm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the aste .",
    "the band 8 qm uses sideband separating receivers that detect two orthogonal polarizations and down - convert the sideband - separated intermediate frequency signals to 48 ghz .",
    "the half power beam width ( hpbw ) was @xmath12 and the main beam efficiency @xmath13 was estimated to be 45% from observations of jupiter . for the backend , we used mac , a 1024 channel digital auto - correlator , which has a band width of 128 mhz and a resolution of 125 khz , corresponding to 78 and 0.076 km s@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the position switch method was employed and a single spectrum toward the source position was obtained for each target . because our tts targets are well known to be less affected by surrounding clouds , we selected off positions near the targets to effectively remove atmospheric fluctuations ; 28 , 15 , and 1 arcmin from the stellar positions of dm tau , lkca 15 , and tw hya , respectively . for the pss , we employed an off position of ( @xmath15 , @xmath16)=(4@xmath17 32@xmath18 6@xmath190 , 17@xmath20 48@xmath21 51@xmath220 ) , which was determined to avoid the co @xmath1110 emission of the l1551 cloud @xcite .",
    "the telescope pointing calibration was performed every 1.52 hours by observing o - cet and irc+10216 in the co @xmath1143 emission line , and the resulting pointing accuracy was @xmath233 . any time variation in intensity scale was checked by observing part of the orion horse - head nebula ( position a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) two or three times daily and was found to be less than @xmath2410% .",
    "the [ c  i ] data were obtained under good sky conditions ( @xmath25 ) , whereas @xmath260.060.10 for the co observations .",
    "the single sideband system noise temperatures were typically 2100 k and 3100 k for [ c  i ] and co , respectively .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) version 3.3.0 software suite , in addition to its asap modules .",
    "it should be noted that we reduced only one polarization dataset because of a beam alignment problem during the observations .",
    "bad data were removed by the _",
    "sdflag _ task , baseline fitting and subtraction of the baseline from the spectra were performed with the _ sdbaseline _ task , and the data sets were combined in each source with the _ sdaverage _ task .",

    "accordingly , the @xmath7(c ) values of the t tauri star targets are one order of magnitude smaller than those of the pss . these results can be attributed to the lack of dense envelopes around the ttss .",

    "the peak velocity and full width half maximum are consistent with those of the disk in molecular lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because of the modest upper energy of the ground state atomic c fine structure line ( @xmath54 k ) , the [ c  i ] emission is likely to be weighted toward the emission from the outer most part of the disk due to beam dilution",
    "in fact , the detected [ c  i ] emission shows a single - peaked profile near the systemic velocity , suggesting that the emission may dominate at the region where the rotation velocity is small , i.e. , the outer part of the disk if keplerian rotation applies .",
    "in addition , the fact that the total mass of c is one order of magnitude smaller than those of the pss ( table [ tab : quantity_ci ] ) supports the disk origin of the [ c  i ] emission .",
    "however , the actual nature of the [ c  i ] emission of dm tau remains unclear due to the large hpbw of the telescope .",
    "high - resolution observations are required to reveal the detailed spatial distribution of the [ c  i ] emission over the disk .",
    "the estimated [ c  i ] intensity of dm tau is consistent with theoretical models of protoplanetary disk chemistry .",
    "@xcite , for example , calculated the [ c  i ] line intensity of a t tauri star with a massive disk of 0.07 @xmath55 through a self - consistent treatment of the pdr near the disk surface .",
    "the resultant peak intensity is expected to be @xmath560.1 k in @xmath57 after correcting for the aste beam size and the distance to the source , which is comparable to our observed intensity .",
    "the higher intensities of the pss than those of the ttss suggest that the atomic carbon line originates mainly from the envelopes .",
    "because the velocity width of the [ c  i ] emission is much narrower than that of the wing emission of a molecular outflow ( @xmath58 km s@xmath14 ) , the high velocity outflow is unlikely to affect the [ c  i ] emission @xcite .",
    "there is a possibility of a low velocity cavity wall swept up by the outflow .",
    "high - resolution [ c  i ] observations are required to separate the envelope from such a low velocity entrainment component .",
    "we introduce the total mass ratio of atomic c to dust grains , @xmath7(c)/@xmath7(dust)@xmath59 ) , to investigate the evolutional variation of m(c ) .",
    "the dust mass , which is generally estimated by optically thin ( sub-)millimeter continuum observations , reflects the total gas mass of the system if the gas - to - dust ratio is constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 is an indicator of a fraction of c with respect to the total amount of gas , which is described as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the gas - to - dust ratio , and @xmath63 is the fractional abundance of c with respect to h@xmath9 . it is important to state that , especially for a protoplanetary disk , the atomic c and the dust grains trace distinct vertical layers of the disk ; the atomic c presumably exists in the disk near - surface layers while the dust grains are mainly at the disk midplane .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 practically indicates the mass of c near the pdr with respect to the total mass .",
    "we compiled @xmath7(dust ) from previous studies , as listed in table [ tab : info ] .",
    "all @xmath7(dust ) data , except that for tw hya , were calculated from the total masses in @xcite , who measured ( sub-)millimeter flux densities with single dish telescopes .",
    "their beam sizes were typically @xmath561015@xmath64 , which is comparable to that of our [ c  i ] observations .",
    "these authors estimated the total ( gas+dust ) disk mass by a simple disk model with power - law density and temperature profiles under an assumed gas - to - dust ratio of 100 . in table",
    "[ tab : info ] , we show the dust mass after correcting for the assumed gas - to - dust ratio . for tw hya , we took the mass estimate from @xcite , who also used a similar simple disk model to estimate the disk mass .",
    "although their observations were made with an interferometer , the flux density of the entire disk was correctly recovered because the disk size is comparable to the detectable scale mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the derived @xmath60 is listed in table [ tab : quantity_ci ] . a clear difference in @xmath60 is apparent between the ttss and pss ; @xmath60 is typically an order of @xmath65 or less for the ttss , whereas the pss show @xmath66 , on average . it should be noted that these results are not significantly affected by the difference in the assumed value of @xmath37 . if we use @xmath6750 k for the pss , which is the same value as in the ttss , we obtain @xmath68 , on average , a value still significantly higher than that for the tts values .",
    "when @xmath6710 k , a typical value in molecular cloud cores , the difference was more noticeable .",
    "as defined above , the decrement of @xmath60 can be interpreted by either a reduced @xmath63 or @xmath62 .",
    "the former case means that @xmath69(c ) decreases as star formation progresses .",
    "the chemical lifetime of c has been theoretically predicted to drop substantially with increments in the gas density @xcite . because the gas density significantly increases from a tenuous protostellar envelope to a dense disk near a tts",
    ", a reduction in @xmath63 is expected at the tts stage .",
    "in fact , the typical density at the disk midplane is estimated to be @xmath70 @xmath71 at 100 au if we assume the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite , whereas the typical density of the pss is @xmath72 @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "if the reduced @xmath62 is the case , the gas in the disk must be depleted to a low level of @xmath73 to explain the @xmath60 decrement of at least one order of magnitude .",
    "however , such a high depletion of overall gas is not expected to occur in the disk , as discussed in  [ sec:4 - 3 ] .",
    "only upper limits were obtained for the [ c  i ] emission from lkca 15 and tw hya , despite the fact that they also have disks as massive as that of dm tau .",
    "one possible explanation is that overall gas depletion with disk evolution leads to a depletion of c. since all the targets are in the evolutional stage of a so - called transitional disk , their disks are expected to be evolved with respect to a filled disk @xcite .",
    "moreover , their advanced stellar ages imply that the disks of lkca 15 and tw hya are older than the dm tau disk .",
    "the actual gas mass is difficult to directly estimate because of the large optical depths of molecular lines .",
    "some modeling efforts by using co data indicate a lower gas - to - dust ratio with respect to the standard interstellar value @xcite . however , as mentioned in  [ sec:4 - 2 ] , the gas mass estimation for tw hya by an hd line emission , which is believed to be a good tracer of gas mass , indicates that the disk is massive so that the gas - to - dust ratio is comparable to the standard interstellar value @xcite . taking into account the fact that the disk model with a nominal gas - to - dust ratio of 100 reproduces well the observed intensity @xcite , an overall gas depletion is unlikely the case .",
    "an alternative is the depletion of volatiles such as c - containing species at the surface with disk evolution .",
    "such a time - dependent sink mechanism of c is proposed based on the observational data of hd and co isotopologue lines @xcite .",
