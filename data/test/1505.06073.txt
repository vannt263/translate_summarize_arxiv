    "statistical models of transmitters locations aim to provide tools to understand real network deployment . for telecommunication companies ,",
    "the _ a priori _ knowledge of the distribution of the antenna locations helps to predict and manage the costs of a network deployment .",
    "such models also provide mathematical tractable methods to estimate the coverage probability of a given network .",
    "these results would also interest telecommunication regulators and public health authorities , since electromagnetic exposure has become a worldwide issue .",
    "the first model introduced in radio networks was the regular hexagonal deterministic network .",
    "although the regular lattice of cells gives an approximation of the cellular concept , it fails to catch the proper reality of network deployment .",
    "it proves also to be an optimistic bound in terms of interference estimation @xcite .",
    "the random nature of the parameters involved in defining a proper coverage strategy makes it difficult to use a deterministic and regular model .",
    "stochastic geometry ideas , especially about random point processes -i.e .",
    "poisson point processes ( ppp ) , matrn hard - core point processes , ginibre point process ( gpp ) and @xmath0-ginibre point process ( @xmath0-gpp)- were then widely explored in the wireless communication literature .",
    "pioneer works in this field were realized by baccelli et al . on ppp @xcite .",
    "many results were then derived , such as the coverage probability in respect of the sinr .",
    "last developments of ppp models also include modelling of heterogeneous ( @xmath1-tier ) networks @xcite .",
    "however , positions of the base stations in a ppp deployed network are uncorrelated with one another",
    ". therefore clusters of points may occur .",
    "mean inter - site distance of such configurations is thus smaller than what happens in reality . as a result ,",
    "ppp models generate more interference than that of a real network .",
    "the articles of andrews et al .",
    "@xcite and nakata et al .",
    "@xcite show that the ppp provide with the most pessimistic prediction of outage probability compared with other repulsive models .",
    "spatial correlations between base stations locations exist , since they have to be separated from one another to maximize coverage and minimize inter - site interferences .",
    "to take into account these effects , repulsive ( or regular ) models were introduced in the literature .",
    "a simple approach is to transform a ppp into a repulsive point process by thinning .",
    "such processes are called matrn hard - core point processes .",
    "interferences for such deployed networks were investigated in @xcite but hard - core models proved to be difficult to manipulate since the outage probability can not be analytically deduced .",
    "soft - core processes then rose community s interest . among them , gpp and @xmath0-gpp ( two determinantal point processes ) were investigated in the wireless communication field .",
    "they were at first introduced by shirai et al .",
    "@xcite in quantum physics to model fermion interactions .",
    "works of miyoshi et al.@xcite and deng et al .",
    "@xcite have derived coverage probability in respect of the sinr for both gpp and @xmath0-gpp models .    in this paper",
    ", we show that base station distribution for an operator and for a technology can be fitted with a @xmath0-gpp distribution in the paris area .",
    "the distribution of all base stations of all operators can be fitted with a ppp .",
    "our main contribution lies in the theoretical justification of this phenomenon .",
    "we prove that the superposition of different @xmath0-gpps converges in distribution to a ppp process .",
    "finally we draw conclusions on the coverage - capacity trade - off made by different operators .",
    "qualitative results are derived from the inferred values of @xmath0 and the intensity @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 can give information on the dimensioning strategy adopted by the operator , while @xmath0 give insights on the coverage .",
    "other existing papers on antenna deployment models mainly consider the computation of the sinr and coverage probability for a wide set of point processes .",
    "we are instead interested in validating the @xmath0-gpp model and the ppp superposition model with real data on a dense urban area .",
    "such a case study is made possible because french frequency regulator ( anfr ) provides location in an open access database @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we define mathematically the @xmath0-gpp and introduce the convergence in distribution theorem for a superposition of @xmath0-gpp . in section iii ,",
    "we give the method used to fit the @xmath3-gpp model with the actual data .",
    "a qualitative interpretation of the deployment strategies is then realized from inferred @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we recall the definition of the @xmath0-gpp . we also introduce the theorem @xmath0-gpp convergence theorem .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the complex plane .",
    "let @xmath5 be a realisation of a certain point process .",
    "let @xmath6 , be @xmath1-tuples of distinct pairwise elements of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a borel set and @xmath8 be any borel function .",
    "the @xmath1-th joint density function of a point process is defined by : @xmath9    let @xmath0 be a real number in @xmath100,1]$ ] , let @xmath2 , a strictly positive real number be the intensity of a point process and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0-gpp is a determinantal point process that can be defined by its correlation functions .    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a kernel such as @xmath14 : @xmath15 with the respect of the lebesgue measure .",
    "a @xmath0-gpp can also be obtained by thinning and rescaling a gpp .",
    "each point of the gpp is kept independently with probability @xmath0 , then a rescaling of ratio @xmath16 is applied in order to maintain the original intensity . if @xmath17 , the @xmath18-gpp is equal to the gpp .",
    "for @xmath0 tending to zero , the thinning increases the randomness of the process , and then the kernel @xmath19 tends to a diagonal matrix .",
    "correlation between points disappears .",
    "the laplace transform of a @xmath0-gpp is given for all @xmath20 by @xmath21 , where the determinant is the one of carleman - fredholm .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath0-gpp laplace transform converges then to the one of a ppp when @xmath0 goes to zero .",
    "one of the main novelties in this paper is the study of the superposition of multiple @xmath0-gpp .",
    "we give the key convergence theorem for the @xmath0-gpp .",
    "+ let @xmath22 be point processes in a metric space @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the space of all locally finite subsets ( configurations ) in @xmath23 .",
    "we now introduce the @xmath0-gpp superposition convergence theorem .",

    "this theorem is proven in appendix [ a1 ]    hypotheses ( i ) and ( ii ) of th.[theo:1 ] are quite restrictive because the intensities of each @xmath0-gpp are dependent of @xmath36 . however , in practice , we mainly work with finite families of @xmath0-gpp",
    ". therefore , we can choose the value of the @xmath37 such that they match the real values of the intensity of each @xmath0-gpp .",
    "in this section we introduce the fitting method that is used to obtain the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we also present the results from the fitting of each deployment and operator in paris , france .      in order to fit the real deployment to the @xmath0-gpp model",
    ", we introduce the @xmath38 function that characterize any point process .",
    "this function is a summary statistic based on inter - point distances .",
    "general information about summary statistics can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath39 be any location in the plane @xmath4 , and @xmath40 be a realization of a @xmath0-gpp .",
    "@xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the contact distribution function and the nearest - neighbor distance distribution function .",
    "the @xmath38-function characterizes the repulsiveness or attractiveness of a point process . if the @xmath38-function is bigger than one , the point process is repulsive , otherwise , it is attractive . by definition of a ppp , @xmath44 in the case of the @xmath0-gpp ,",
    "the @xmath38-function is always bigger than one on its definition domain .",
    "this confirms that the @xmath0-gpp is a repulsive point process .",
    "it characterizes the @xmath0-gpp and its expression is proved in @xcite .",
    "-function is fitted on the points within the rectangular window.,width=332 ]    thanks to r language and the spatstat package @xcite , the estimate of the @xmath38-function is derived from the raw data . since we consider only a finite set of antennas , edge - effect might appear on the @xmath38-function estimate",
    ". we then have to keep a subset of the data to perform the estimation .",
    "figure [ figure:1 ] gives the window we considered for extracting data in paris , france .",
    "it covers about 60% of the city and its shape is chosen to match the geographical borders .",
    "the values of the @xmath38-function estimate are computed for @xmath45 . above @xmath46 ,",
    "the estimation is not relevant due to the edge - effect .",
    "@xmath38 is then directly fitted on the estimate and the parameter @xmath0 is deduced .",
    "an example of fitting is given in figure [ figure:2 ] .",
    "it is clear that the point process formed by the base stations locations is repulsive and fits well the theoretical model .",
    "therefore , it outfits the ppp model , because the @xmath38-function a ppp is equal to one for all @xmath47 . in the next paragraph we present the results we obtained on raw data .",

    ", operators reused and shared some existing 2 g sites .",
    "therefore , we consider that classifying the base station sites per operator is more relevant than classifying them by technologies .",
    "table [ table:2 ] summaries these results .",
    "as expected , previous conclusions still hold as values of @xmath0 are stable between the two tables",
    ". we also notice that free , as a newcomer ( 2012 ) , has a small amount of traffic to deal with , and therefore has deployed less antennas than its competitors .",
    "data analysis also shows that the superposition of all sites is tending to a ppp as @xmath0 is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the ppp model still holds as an indicator of electromagnetic exposure of cellular networks .",
    "in this paper , we successfully show that @xmath0-gpp is a realistic model for base station distribution .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is inferred by using statistical tools on real data .",
    "qualitative results on network deployment are then derived .",
    "we also prove theoretically that the superposition of multiple @xmath0-gpps converges in distribution to a ppp justifying observations made on real deployments .",
    "this will have greater implications in modelling multi - tiers networks .",
