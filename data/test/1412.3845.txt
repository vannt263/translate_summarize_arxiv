    "the first generation stars , i.e. , population iii ( pop iii ) stars with zero metallicity , form out of primordial material left over from the big bang . they are believed to produce a significant amount of energy in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and to serve as the main sources to re - ionize the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the confirmation and analysis of pop iii stars or pop iii hosting high - redshift galaxies are among the most crucial goals to studies of the origin and evolution of galaxies in the early universe .    in recent years , a number of galaxy candidates at @xmath14 have been found , mainly due to ambitious near - infrared ( nir ) imaging surveys with greater depths and larger fields of view ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the biggest ground - based telescopes ,",
    "significant progress has also been made in spectroscopically confirming ly@xmath15 emission from galaxies at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , the fraction of galaxy candidates at @xmath17 that have ly@xmath15 emission is still very small , mainly because a rising igm neutral fraction to suppress the ly@xmath15 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , sensitive mm / sub - mm facilities like the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) have allowed co and [ cii ] to serve as possible tracers of metallicity and to address the optical bias in star formation rate ( sfr ) measurements for galaxies at @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "direct detections of pop iii signatures in high redshift galaxies , however , remain a major challenge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical investigations suggest that pop iii stars have a high characteristic mass , and short life spans on the order of a few million years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "feedback from the first stars will metal - enrich the local primordial interstellar medium ( ism ) and quench further pop iii star formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , pop iii stars should only be dominant in very young galaxies at high redshift .",
    "on average , younger galaxies tend to be less massive than more mature systems at given redshift , and thus they are intrinsically fainter in the continuum bands , making the direct detection very challenging with today s telescopes .",
    "@xcite suggest that , at @xmath18 , pop - iii dominated ( @xmath19 of total luminosity ) galaxies are extremely faint ( @xmath20 ) , which is below current detection limits .",
    "the he ii @xmath211640 line from high redshift galaxies has been long suggested to depend strongly on both the imf and the stellar metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hard ionizing radiation , particularly photons that ionize helium , is greatly enhanced by the high surface temperature of pop iii stars .",
    "therefore , the resulting strong recombined he ii @xmath0 line is a direct footprint of pop iii stars",
    ". moreover , the he ii @xmath211640 line is much less complicated to model and interpret , compared to the ly@xmath15 recombination line @xcite .",
    "also , he ii @xmath0 photons pass more easily through the partially neutral igm at high redshift than ly@xmath15 photons @xcite . using the model of @xcite ,",
    "one expects to detect strong he ii @xmath211640 emission in @xmath22 spectroscopically - comfirmed galaxies if @xmath23 of the sfr is contributed by pop iii stars with a top - heavy imf .    in the past few years",
    ", a few observations have probed pop iii signatures in high - redshift galaxies by looking for strong he ii emission @xcite . these studies have reported nondetections , constraining the pop iii star formation rate ( hereafter sfr@xmath5 ) to less than a few m@xmath24 yr@xmath9 .",
    "note the narrow he ii line ( fwhm @xmath10 a few hundred km s@xmath9 ) is one of the pop iii star signatures , which is distinguished from broad he ii emission from agn @xcite .",
    "the line width measurement through spectroscopy is required to unambiguously confirm the he ii from pop iii stars .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath10 10% of galaxies at @xmath25 with i@xmath26 show he ii emission , with rest - frame equivalent widths ( ew ) @xmath10 @xmath27  , and argue that some of the galaxies with narrow he ii lines are compatible with the predictions of a pop iii scenario .",
    "however , the ews of these he ii emission lines are not exceptionally high compared with those from some other astrophysical objects , so the he ii emission also might be interpreted as metal - poor nebular he ii emission .",
    "more metal - poor galactic environments could be expected at higher redshifts .",
    "it is thus important to search for secure pop iii signatures in the highest redshift galaxies . at z @xmath28 7 ,",
    "the he ii @xmath0 line is redshifted into the j - band .",
    "strong near - infrared sky lines make it challenging to conduct ground - based deep observations .",
    "the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on hst has a high throughput , and does not suffer a strong ir background from the atmosphere .",

    "11 orbits ( @xmath10 a 30,800 sec of integration ) are allocated in f132n to probe the he ii emission .",
    "a 4-orbit integration were allocated to measure the continuum through the f125w and f160w filters , with 2 orbits for each broadband filter .",
    "the broadband imaging is used to perform an accurate continuum subtraction in the narrowband , as well as to measure the unobscured sfr and galaxy morphology .",
    "our observations are designed to detect he ii emission at the @xmath40 level if @xmath23 of the star formation in the galaxy is contributed by pop iii stars with a salpeter imf with 50 @xmath41 m / m@xmath37 @xmath41 500 .",
