    "young massive star clusters ( ymcs ) are among the main objects resulting from violent star - forming episodes triggered by galaxy collisions , mergers , and close encounters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "they are also referred to as ` young populous clusters , ' a term first coined by @xcite , who used it to describe 23 clusters containing bright , blue stars in the large magellanic cloud . in @xcite , the ` young ' aspect is demonstrated by the fact that all clusters have main sequences that extend to absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath8 , while ` populous ' describes their richness ( stellar membership ) .",
    "however , ymcs are also observed in quiescent galaxies @xcite and in the disks of isolated spirals , although higher cluster - formation efficiencies are associated with environments exhibiting high star - formation rates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it has become clear that , in many ways , ymcs resemble young versions of the old globular clusters ( gcs ) associated with all large galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "ymcs are seemingly absent in the milky way ; possibly the best example of a galactic ymc is westerlund 1 , a heavily reddened cluster with an age and mass of 45 myr @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite , respectively .",
    "since the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite , evolutionary population synthesis modeling has become a powerful tool to interpret integrated spectrophotometric observations of galaxies and their components , such as star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of star clusters is usually modeled by means of the simple stellar population ( ssp ) approximation .",
    "an ssp is defined as a single generation of coeval stars formed from the same progenitor molecular cloud ( thus implying a single metallicity ) , and governed by a given stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "age and metallicity are two basic star cluster parameters .",
    "the most direct method to determine a cluster s age is by employing main - sequence photometry , since the absolute magnitude of the main - sequence turnoff is predominantly affected by age ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , until recently ( cf .",
    "* ) , this method was only applied to the star clusters in the milky way and its satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite estimated the age of an m31 gc using extremely deep images observed with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "s advanced camera for surveys .",
    "generally , the ages of extragalactic star clusters are determined by comparing their observed spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) and/or spectroscopy with the predictions of ssp models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , ssp models assume that cluster imfs are fully populated , i.e. , that clusters contain infinite numbers of stars with a continuous distribution of stellar masses , and that all evolutionary stages are well sampled .",
    "real clusters , however , contain a finite number of stars .",
    "therefore , a disagreement between the observed cluster colors and theoretical colors derived from ssp models may become apparent ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "other limitations inherent to ssp models arise from our poor understanding of some advanced stellar evolutionary stages , such as the supergiant and the asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) phases ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    located at a distance of @xmath10 kpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath11 mag @xcite , m31 is the nearest and largest spiral galaxy in the local group of galaxies .",
    "it has been the subject of many gc studies and surveys , dating back to the early study of @xcite .",
    "based on previous publications @xcite , @xcite compiled the first large m31 gc catalog , containing @xmath12 photometric data of approximately 300 gc candidates . over the past decades ,",
    "several major catalogs of m31 gcs and gc candidates have been published , including major efforts by the bologna group @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "to ascertain their properties , @xcite performed an imaging survey of 20 blccs in the disk of m31 using the _ hst _ s wide field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) .",

    "vdb0-b195d was first detected by @xcite .",
    "its color is extremely blue ( e.g. , @xmath15 mag ; * ? ? ?",

    "he determined an integrated stellar spectral type equivalent to a0 , which implies that the cluster contains massive stars .",
    "in addition , vdb0-b195d is particularly extended and most previous photometric studies did not include the full extent of the object s light distribution ( see for details * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we will provide an overview of previous studies that included the cluster in  2.1 .",

    "combined with photometry in optical broad - band @xmath4 and near - infrared @xmath5 filters from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) taken from @xcite , we obtained the sed of vdb0-b195d in 22 filters , covering the wavelengh range from 3000 to 20,000  .    in this paper , we describe the details of the observations and our approach to the data reduction in  2 . in  3 , we determine the age and mass of vdb0-b195d by comparing observational seds with population synthesis models .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results and provide a summary in  4 .",

    "b195d was given a low level of confidence ( class d ) of being a genuine cluster ( classes a and b were assigned very high and high levels of confidence , respectively ) .",
    "it was only recently independently confirmed to be a single object .",
    "@xcite presented a new catalog containing 670 likely star clusters , stars , possible stars , and galaxies in the field of m31 , all with updated high - quality coordinates accurate to @xmath17 , based on images from either the local group galaxies survey ( lggs ) @xcite or the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "they use the designation vdb0-b195d , associated with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( j2000.0 ) , which are the coordinates we adopt in this paper .",
    "independently , @xcite studied the properties of vdb0-b195d in detail based on their _ hst_/wfpc2 imaging survey of young massive gcs in m31 .",
    "they initially selected vdb0-b195d as two ymcs in m31 , but their wfpc2 images showed unequivocally that these two sample objects are , in fact , the same cluster .",
    "in addition , the _ hst _ images clearly confirmed that vdb0-b195d is a real cluster .",
    "however , it is difficult to establish whether it is more similar to ordinary open clusters , similar to those in the disk of the milky way , than to ymcs that may evolve to become disk gcs ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "spectral observations of vdb0-b195d were obtained by @xcite  yielding classification spectra and the object s radial velocity  and @xcite , who used them for determination of its radial velocity and metallicity .",
    "observations of the ymc vdb0-b195d were obtained with the batc 60/90 cm schmidt telescope located at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatory of china ( naoc ) .",
    "this telescope is equipped with 15 intermediate - band filters covering the optical wavelength range from 3000 to 10,000  .",
    "the filter system was specifically designed to avoid contamination by the brightest and most variable night - sky emission lines .",
    "descriptions of the batc photometric system can be found in @xcite . before february 2006 ,",
    "a ford aerospace 2k@xmath202k thick ccd camera was installed , with a pixel size of 15 @xmath21 m and a field of view of @xmath22 , yielding a resolution of @xmath23 pixel@xmath24 . since february 2006",
    ", a new e2v 4k@xmath204k thinned ccd with a pixel size of 12 @xmath21 m has been in operation , featuring a resolution of @xmath25 pixel@xmath24 .",
    "the blue quantum efficiency of the new , thinned ccd is 92.2% at 4000   , which is much higher than for the old , thick device ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "a field including vdb0-b195d in the @xmath26@xmath27 filters was observed with the thinned ccd , and in @xmath28@xmath29 bands with the thick ccd .",
    "1 shows a finding chart of vdb0-b195d in the batc @xmath30 band ( centered at 5795  ) , obtained with the naoc 60/90 cm schmidt telescope .",
    "we adopt an aperture with a radius of @xmath31 ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) for the integrated photometry discussed in this paper .",
    "the batc survey team obtained 61 images of vdb0-b195d in 15 batc filters between january 2004 and november 2006 .",
    "@xcite performed the data reduction of these images , which formed part of their m31 - 7 field .",
    "table 1 contains the observation log , including the batc filter names , the central wavelength and bandwidth of each filter , the number of images observed through each filter , and the total observing time per filter .",
    "multiple images through the same filter were combined to improve image quality ( i.e. , increase the signal - to - noise ratio and remove spurious signal ) .",
    "we determined the intermediate - band magnitudes of vdb0-b195d on the combined images using a standard aperture photometry approach , i.e. , the phot routine in daophot @xcite .",
    "calibration of the magnitude zero level in the batc photometric system is similar to that of the spectrophotometric ab magnitude system . for flux calibration ,",
    "the oke - gunn @xcite primary flux standard stars hd 19445 , hd 84937 , bd + 26@xmath322606 , and bd + 17@xmath324708 were observed during photometric nights @xcite .",
    "vdb0-b195d is located in the m31 - 7 field of @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux of the m31 - 7 field was calibrated based on secondary standard transformations using the m31 - 1 field , which was calibrated , in turn , by the four oke - gunn primary flux standard stars by @xcite .",
    "since vdb0-b195d is an extended object , an appropriate aperture size must be adopted to determine its total luminosity .",
    "the ( radial ) photometric asymptotic growth curve , in all batc bands , flattens out at a radius of @xmath33 .",
    "inspection ensured that this aperture is adequate for photometry , i.e. , vdb0-b195d does not show any obvious signal beyond this radius .",
    "in addition , this aperture is nearly the same as that adopted by @xcite to determine the cluster s photometry in the @xmath4 bands , based on the m31 imaging survey of @xcite ( see  2.4 below ) .",
    "therefore , we use an aperture with @xmath34 for integrated photometry , i.e. , @xmath35  pixels for the 2k@xmath202k thick ccd camera , and @xmath36  pixels for the 4k@xmath204k thinned ccd camera . vdb0-b195d is projected onto the disk of m31 , where the background is bright and fluctuates , potentially as a function of distance from the cluster center . to avoid contamination from background fluctuations , we adopted annuli for background subtraction spanning between 10 and 15 pixels for the 2k@xmath202k thick ccd camera , and from 13 to 20 pixels for the 4@xmath204k thinned ccd camera , both corresponding to @xmath3726@xmath38 . while these annuli are spatially as close as possible to the region dominated by cluster light ( so that any differences in background flux are minimized ) , they are wide enough to average out any expected background fluctuations .",
    "the calibrated photometry of vdb0-b195d in 15 filters is summarized in column ( 6 ) of table 1 , in conjunction with the @xmath39 magnitude uncertainties , which include uncertainties from the calibration errors of both the m31 - 1 field standard stars ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ` the secondary standard stars ' in common between the m31 - 1 and m31 - 7 fields used for calculation of the mean magnitude offsets between the standard and instrumental magnitudes ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as those resulting from our daophot application .",
    "four independent sets of photometric data exist for vdb0-b195d . @xcite",
    "obtained @xmath12 photometry using observations of the 200-inch hale telescope , @xcite performed @xmath40 photometry based on photographic plates observed with the 152 cm ritchey - chrtien @xmath41/8 telescope of the university of bologna in loiano , @xcite obtained @xmath12 photometry for vdb0-b195d using observations with the university of hawaii s 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea using the @xmath41/10 secondary and coronene - coated @xmath42 gec ccd , and @xcite performed @xmath12 photometry based on photo - electric observations with the 2.6 m shain telescope of the crimean astrophysical observatory .",
    "in addition , in the revised bologna catalogue ( rbc ) of m31 gcs published by @xcite , the photometric data of vdb0-b195d in optical bands are based on @xcite and @xcite , and transformed to the reference system of @xcite by applying offsets derived from objects in common between the relevant catalog and the data set of @xcite . in the rbc , vdb0-b195d was regarded as two objects .",
    "we list these photometric data in table 2 for comparison .",
    "note that , in the latest rbc incarnation ( version 3.5 , updated on 27 march 2008 ) , vdb0-b195d is included as a single object .",
    "@xcite also determined 2mass @xmath5 photometric magnitudes for vdb0-b195d ( transformed to the cit photometric system ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we have included in table 3 .",
    "in addition , @xcite realized that vdb0-b195d is a particularly extended object and that it is possible that the photometry of @xcite ( compiled in the rbc ) was obtained with apertures that were not large enough to include all of its flux .",
    "therefore , they redetermined its photometric values in the @xmath4 bands based on the m31 imaging survey of @xcite using an aperture with @xmath43 , which are also listed in table 3 .    from a comparison of the values in tables 2 and 3 ,",
    "it is clear that the magnitudes of @xcite are brighter , while the results of the three other references are consistent .",
    "the magnitudes determined by @xcite are much brighter , however , because of their careful inclusion of all of the cluster s flux .",
    "to compare our photometric results with previously published values , we transformed the magnitudes of vdb0-b195d in the batc intermediate bands to broad - band @xmath0-equivalent photometry based on the relationships obtained by @xcite .",
    "these are also listed in table 3 , and the uncertainties include those originating from the transformation based on the relationships of @xcite and their calibration errors ( column 5 of their table 3 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the result of the comparison . in general ,",
    "the other photometric data are fainter than ours and those of @xcite .",
    "fig . 2 and table 3 show that our new @xmath1 magnitudes agree with the results of @xcite , and that the @xmath2 magnitude obtained in this paper is 0.32 mag brighter than that of @xcite . considering the photometric errors of both @xcite and our current study , these two @xmath2-band photometric results are consistent within @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we should keep in mind that , although the @xmath1 magnitudes obtained in this paper are consistent with the results of @xcite within @xmath39 , the disagreement in @xmath2 magnitudes at this level is understandable .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the original photometry in the present paper was obtained in the proprietary batc filters and transformed to the @xmath0 system using transformation equations .",
    "@xcite determined these conversions based on the broad - band @xmath0 magnitudes of 48 stars from @xcite and @xcite in the landolt sa95 field , and their photometric data in the 15 batc intermediate - band filters .",
    "in addition , the central wavelengths and bandwidths of the batc and @xmath0 systems differ .",
    "in fact , a similar significant disagreement of @xmath2-band photometric data for some m31 gcs was reported by @xcite , citing similar arguments .",
    "to determine the age and mass of vdb0-b195d , we compared its sed with theoretical stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the sed consists of photometric data in the 15 batc intermediate bands obtained in this paper and optical broad - band @xmath4 and 2mass near - infrared @xmath44 data from @xcite , listed in table 3 .",
    "we used the galev ssp models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for our comparisons .",
    "the galev ssps are based on the padova stellar isochrones , with the most recent versions using the updated @xcite isochrones ( which include the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant - branch phase ) , and a @xcite stellar imf with lower- and upper - mass limits of 0.10 and between 50 and 70 @xmath45 , respectively , depending on metallicity .",
    "the full set of models spans the wavelength range from 91 to 160 @xmath21 m .",
    "these models cover ages from @xmath46 to @xmath47 yr , with an age resolution of 4 myr for ages up to 2.35 gyr , and 20 myr for greater ages .",
    "the galev ssp models include five initial metallicities , @xmath48 ( solar metallicity ) , and 0.05 .    since our observational data consist of integrated luminosities through the set of batc filters , we convolved the galev ssp seds with the batc intermediate- , optical broad - band @xmath4 , and 2mass filter - response curves to obtain synthetic optical and near - infrared photometry for comparison .",
    "the synthetic @xmath49 filter magnitude can be computed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the theoretical sed and @xmath52 the response curve of the @xmath49 filter of the batc , @xmath4 , and 2mass photometric systems . here",
    ", @xmath51 varies with age and metallicity . since",
    "the observed magnitudes in the @xmath4 and 2mass photometric systems are given in the vega system , we transformed them to the ab system for our fits .      to obtain the intrinsic sed of vdb0-b195d",
    ", its photometry must be dereddened . to date , only @xcite obtained reddening values for vdb0-b195d .",
    "they compared the observed cmd with theoretical isochrones and determined @xmath53 mag .",
    "@xcite were unable to derive the cluster s reddening value because of the presence of a foreground field star , so they adopted @xmath54 mag ( external rms error ) , equivalent to the mean reddening of the young clusters in m31 . in this paper , we therefore adopt the reddening value from @xcite .    in addition , cluster seds are affected by age and metallicity effects .",
    "therefore , we can only accurately constrain a cluster s age if the metallicity is known .",
    "@xcite found that the cmd of vdb0-b195d , based on their _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 observations , is best reproduced by the solar - metallicity models of @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt solar metallicity for vdb0-b195d .      the lowest - luminosity limit ( lll ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that it is meaningless to compare a cluster with population synthesis models to obtain its age and mass if its integrated luminosity is lower than the luminosity of the most luminous star included in the model for the relevant age .",
    "the lll method states that clusters fainter than this limit can not be analyzed using standard procedures such as @xmath55 minimization of the observed values with respect to the mean ssp models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "below the lll , cluster ages and masses can not be obtained self - consistently . to take into account the effects on the integrated luminosities of statistically sampling the stellar imf ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , we used the theoretical padova isochrones at http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd ( cmd2.2 ) .",
    "this interactive web interface provides isochrones for a number of photometric systems , including optical broad - band , 2mass , and the batc data used here .",
    "we obtained the solar - metallicity ( @xmath56 ) isochrones of @xcite , as recommended by cmd2.2 , based on the @xcite imf so as to match the imf selection for our age and mass determinations of vdb0-b195d in  3.4 ( see  3.1 for details ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the lll values as a function of age for the different filters used in this paper .",
    "these luminosities are obtained by identifying the most luminous star on each isochrone for the relevant passband .",
    "the gray area shows the cluster s absolute luminosity , assuming a distance modulus of @xmath57 mag ( 785 kpc ) for m31 @xcite .",
    "the upper luminosity limit has been corrected for extinction , based on a reddening value of @xmath58 mag .",
    "the interstellar extinction curve , @xmath59 , is taken from @xcite , @xmath60 .",
    "we see that vdb0-b195d does not lie below the lll in any of the passbands used here .",
    "this means that , in general , vdb0-b195d can host the most luminous star that would be present theoretically for the given age of the cluster .      in the previous section , the lll test proves that the luminosity of vdb0 - 195d is higher than the luminosity of its brightest star expected for a given cluster age , i.e. , that using ssp models is not completely meaningless .",
    "in addition , the bright absolute magnitude of vdb0 - 195d allows us to consider a possibility that the cluster is massive enough and imf sampling effects should not strongly impact the fitting results .",
    "so we will determine the cluster s age and mass estimates based on direct comparisons with ssp mean values in this section .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that this approach is a compromise .",
    "in fact , the fitting results ( fig . 4 and table 5 ) show probable problem even for relative massive clusters .",
    "we use a @xmath55 minimization test to determine which galev ssp models are most compatible with the observed seds , @xmath61 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the integrated magnitude in the @xmath49 filter of a theoretical ssp at age @xmath63 ( for solar metallicity ) , @xmath64 is the intrinsic , integrated magnitude , and @xmath65 is the magnitude uncertainty , defined as @xmath66 here , @xmath67 is the observational uncertainty from column ( 6 ) of table 1 and column ( 2 ) of table 3 , @xmath68 is the uncertainty associated with the model itself , @xmath69 is the uncertainty in the reddening value , and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is taken from @xcite , @xmath60 , and @xmath72 is the uncertainty in the distance modulus , for the @xmath49 filter . @xcite",
    "estimated the uncertainty associated with the term @xmath73 by comparing the colors obtained from different stellar evolutionary tracks and spectral libraries .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath74 mag .",
    "@xcite pointed out that vdb0-b195d is a particularly extended object and that the photometric measurements of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite did not include all of its flux .",
    "therefore , we adopt the photometry of @xcite to fit the observed sed with theoretical ssps for our age determination .",
    "the fit yielding the minimum @xmath55 value ( @xmath75 ) was adopted as the best fit and we adopted the corresponding age value , @xmath6  myr .",
    "in addition , our best - fitting age estimate of @xmath76 myr results from using the ( redder ) @xmath77@xmath29 and @xmath78 photometry ; using only the blue part of the cluster s sed ( @xmath79@xmath80 , where any effects caused by stochasticity may be smaller ) yields an age of @xmath81 myr . the uncertainty was estimated using confidence limits . if @xmath82 , the resulting age is within the 68.3% probability range ; here , @xmath83 is the number of free parameters , i.e. , the number of observational data points minus the number of parameters used in the theoretical model .",
    "therefore , the accepted age range is derived from those fits that have @xmath84 .",
    "the best reduced-@xmath55defined as @xmath85and age are listed in table 4 .",
    "the best fit to the sed of vdb0-b195d is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where we display the intrinsic cluster sed ( symbols with error bars ) , as well as the integrated sed ( open circles ) and spectrum of the best - fitting model . from fig .",
    "4 , we note that the observational data in the @xmath86 , @xmath28 , @xmath87 , and @xmath29 batc filters and in the @xmath88 band do not match the best - fitting model very well ( the difference is approximately 0.3 mag ) .",
    "photometric uncertainties in these filters may cause some differences , although this might not be the main reason for the discrepancy .",
    "as we know , observational star clusters seds are affected by age , metallicity and reddening .",
    "if the reddening value and metallicity adopted in this paper are not problematic , discrepancy between our observations and the best - fitting model may reflect the difficulty in achieving an appropriate ( but formal ) fit of an sed of a single , real cluster by ssp models .",
    "however , as we will see below , the reddening value adopted in this paper may be bigger than the actual reddening of vdb0-b195d .",
    "in addition , the differences between the photometric data and the model in fig . 4 show a somewhat systematic behavior with wavelength : in bluer passbands the cluster seems to be more luminous than predicted by the model , while in redder passbands it is fainter than the corresponding model predictions .",
    "a blue excess and red deficiency in the observed sed with respect to the model predictions may indicate a shortage of red giants ( rgs ) , which can occur when the cluster is either younger or less massive ( or both ) than the corresponding best - fitting model suggests .",
    "in other words , imf discreteness may play a role : due to a relatively longer main - sequence ( ms ) phase and shorter rg phase , a random young cluster is typically bluer than predicted by ssp models . at the same time , we find that the reddening value adopted affects the fitting result greatly .",
    "in fact , the best fit to the sed of vdb0-b195d improves a great deal when adopting a smaller reddening value such as @xmath89 : @xmath90 ; the resulting age ( @xmath91 myr ) is nearly the same as one ( @xmath6 myr ) obtained with @xmath92 .",
    "we next determined the mass of vdb0-b195d .",
    "the galev models include absolute magnitudes ( in the vega system ) in 77 filters for ssps of @xmath93 , including 66 filters of the _ hst _ , johnson @xmath0 ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cousins @xmath94 ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath95 @xcite systems .",
    "the difference between the intrinsic absolute magnitudes and those given by the model provides a direct measurement of the cluster mass , in units of @xmath93 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that this is only correct for cluster masses above @xmath93 .",
    "we estimated the mass of vdb0-b195d using magnitudes in all of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands . therefore , we transformed the 2mass @xmath5 magnitudes to the photometric system of @xcite using the equations given by @xcite",
    ". the resulting mass determinations for vdb0-b195d are listed in table 5 with their @xmath39 uncertainties including contributions from uncertainties in extinction and distance modulus . from table 5",
    ", we see that the mass of vdb0-b195d obtained based on the magnitudes in different filters is very different .",
    "( the highest mass obtained , based on the @xmath2-band magnitude , is @xmath96 more massive than that obtained using the @xmath97 magnitude . ) in addition , the mass estimates differ systematically with filters . provided that vdb0-b195d is massive enough to be fitted by ssp models , a systematic trend of masses based on different passbands may indicate a problem with reddening value adopted for the cluster .",
    "if the actual reddening is smaller than the adopted value , the actual luminosity would be overestimated .",
    "this effect is small in redder filters but strong in bluer filters . as discussed in age estimation",
    ", a smaller reddening value can improve the fitting result greatly .",
    "in fact , a smaller reddening value can reduce the mass discrepancies based on the magnitudes in different filters .",
    "when we adopted @xmath89 , the mass of vdb0-b195d obtained based on the magnitudes in different filters is the same within 1@xmath98 .",
    "we list these estimates in table 7 . from table 5 , we know that the mass of vdb0-b195d obtained in paper is between @xmath99 when the reddening value is adopted to be @xmath100 .",
    "vdb0-b195d was previously shown to be a massive cluster based on _ hst_/wfpc2 observations .",
    "its color is extremely blue and it is very bright , particularly in blue bands . in addition , vdb0-b195d is an extended object , and most previous photometric measurements did not include its full flux distribution ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    in this paper",
    ", we obtained the cluster s sed in the 15 batc intermediate - band filters .",
    "we subsequently determined its age and mass by comparing our multicolor photometry with theoretical stellar population synthesis models .",
    "our multicolor photometric data consist of 15 intermediate - band filters obtained in this paper , and broad - band @xmath4 and 2mass @xmath5 from @xcite , covering a wavelength range from 3000 to 20,000   .",
    "our results show that vdb0-b195d is a genuine ymc in m31 .",
    "to understand the real nature of the blccs , @xcite performed an _",
    "hst _ imaging survey of 20 blccs in m31 s disk . as a test case , @xcite presented details of the data - reduction pipeline that will be applied to all survey data and describe its application to vdb0-b195d .",
    "they estimated the object s age , by comparison of the observed cmd with theoretical isochrones from @xcite , at @xmath101 myr .",
    "in addition , they constrained realistic upper and lower limits to the cluster s age , independent of the adopted metallicity , within the relatively narrow range from 12 to 63 myr . using maraston s ssp models of solar metallicity @xcite , @xcite and @xcite imfs , and photometric values in the @xmath102 and 2mass @xmath103 ,",
    "@xmath104 , and @xmath88 bands , @xcite concluded that the mass of vdb0-b195d is @xmath105 , with their best estimates in the range @xmath106 .",
    "@xcite presented an updated catalog of 1300 objects in m31 , including spectroscopic and imaging surveys , based on images from either the lggs or the dss and spectra taken with the hectospec fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "they derived ages and reddening values for 140 young clusters by comparing their observed spectra with model spectra from the starburst99 ssp suite @xcite .",
    "the results show that these clusters are less than 2 gyr old , while most have ages between @xmath107 and @xmath108 yr ( the age of vdb0-b195d they derive is @xmath109 ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite also estimated the masses of these young clusters using @xmath102-band photometry and model mass - to - light ratios @xcite corresponding to the derived spectroscopic ages .",
    "this resulted in masses ranging from @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "the mass of vdb0-b195d obtained by @xcite is @xmath112 ( no uncertainty quoted ) .",
    "we compare the various age and mass estimates of vdb0-b195d in table 6 .",
    "our newly obtained age is older than the estimates of both @xcite and @xcite , while the mass obtained in this paper is higher than the estimate of @xcite and consistent with the determination of @xcite .",
    "however , our results are in agreement with those of both @xcite and @xcite within @xmath113 .",
    "the age and mass obtained in this paper confirms that vdb0-b195d is genuinely a ymc in m31 .    as we know",
    ", ssp models describe a very special case of a continuous distribution of stellar mass ( or light ) along isochrones .",
    "this is well approximated by clusters with masses larger than @xmath93 .",
    "also , for cluster masses of about @xmath114 , ssp models can probably still be applied since a systematic difference between ssp models and observations should , on average , be smaller than 0.05 mag for clusters older than 10 myr ( see fig . 3 in piskunov et al .",
    "however , from the results of this paper , we may conclude that , probably , a formal fitting of ssp models to observed seds can not be used without caution even for relatively massive ( or apparently massive ) clusters , and it is highly doubtful that this approach can be applied in a routine work providing accurate cluster parameters .",
    "the relative accuracy of 10% for age and 20% found for the mass of vdb0-b195d seems to be rather formal and not very confident .",
    "in addition , observational star clusters seds are affected by reddening , an effect that is also difficult to separate from the combined effects of age and metallicity ( calzetti 1997 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1997 ; origlia et al .",
    "only the metallicity and reddening are derived accurately ( and , ideally , independently ) , these degeneracies are largely ( if not entirely ) reduced , and ages can then also be estimated accurately based on a comparison of multicolor photometry spanning a significant wavelength range ( de grijs et al . 2003b",
    "; anders et al . 2004 ) with theoretical stellar population synthesis models .",
    "it is true that the discrepancy between our observations and the best - fitting model is great , and the mass of vdb0-b195d obtained based on the magnitudes in different filters is very different .",
    "however , when we adopt a smaller reddening value , the results improve greatly .",
    "so , we conclude that the actual reddening value of vdb0-b195d may be smaller than @xmath92 .",
