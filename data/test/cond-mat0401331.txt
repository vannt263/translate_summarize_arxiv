    "boson - fermion attractions enhance the overlap between the two species , favoring in principle a boson - mediated fermion pairing @xcite , and ultimately lead to the collapse of the cloud as the boson - fermion coupling strength overcomes the fermi pressure . collapse has been observed experimentally in the @xmath2rb-@xmath3k mixture as a sudden disappearance of the fermion cloud when the number of bosons , and hence the coupling between the two species , is increased @xcite . the equilibrium properties and the phase diagram of a mixture with attractive interactions",

    "in contrast , the bb spectra contain in the same limit several weak peaks at higher frequencies above the pure @xmath1 mode of the bosons , owing to the boson - boson interactions . for @xmath75",
    "the rpa spectra are very complex , from the lifting of degeneracy in the discrete - level structure which is due to the interactions with the bosons .",
    "the fermionic peaks can be recognized as broad fragmented contributions of largest height in the fermionic spectral functions , while the bosonic peaks are usually isolated and are most marked in the bosonic spectra @xcite .    quite interestingly ,",

    "the frequency of these two peaks tends to decrease with increasing @xmath43 , similarly to what is found for the same modes in the collisional regime .",

    "in summary , we have used the equations of generalized hydrodynamics to study the collective modes of trapped boson - fermion mixtures with mutual attractive interactions driving the mixture towards the collapse instability .",
    "we have focused on two specific systems of experimental interest , for which we have chosen two different routes to collapse .    in both cases",
    "we find that the collective spectra show a frequency softening of a family of modes of bosonic nature as a signature of the incipient collapse .",
    "this softening becomes most pronounced in a very narrow region of parameters near collapse .",
    "a second effect of increasing the attractive coupling between the two species is a blue shift of the modes of fermionic origin , which becomes more evident for large numbers of bosons and reflects the compression of the fermionic cloud from the interactions with the bosons .",
    "a comparison of the hydrodynamic spectra with the spectra calculated in the collisionless regime within the random - phase approximation suggests that both the blue shift of the `` fermionic '' modes and the softening of the `` bosonic '' modes are general features of the dynamics of the mixture . by comparing the height of the peaks in the bosonic and fermionic spectral functions",
    "we also conclude that the two families of modes can be most efficiently excited by applying the driving fields separately on the species .",
    "our analysis has been restricted to the linear regime , neglecting nonlinear and beyond - mean - field effects which may start to play a role close to collapse .",
