    "recent developments in 2d electronic spectroscopy ( 2des ) of molecular aggregates have demonstrated the presence of coherent dynamics in the electronic degrees of freedom ( dof ) , known as electronic coherence , as opposed to the expected incoherent hopping dynamics .",
    "2des was first used in the fleming group to measure long - lived oscillations in the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) photosynthetic pigment - protein complex , which reveals the presence of long - lived electronic coherence @xcite .",
    "this has led to a heated debate about its importance to the efficiency of the excitonic energy transfer in photosynthesis in general . since then , long - lived coherence has been reported in many other systems @xcite .",
    "the term quantum coherence , generally used to describe the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix in the exciton basis , can be associated with several physical phenomena .",
    "it is particularly important here to distinguish between a _",
    "static coherence _ that remains constant for long times and corresponds to stationary effects in equilibrium states or non - equilibrium steady states ( e.g. , localization and entanglement with the bath ) , and a _ dynamical coherence _",
    ", which is a transient effect associated with the time - evolution of the superposition of eigen states .",
    "the latter is related to the recently discovered quantum beats in 2des measurements , which can be quantified as transient oscillations in the coherence term .",
    "the issue of sunlight - induced coherence refers to the dynamic coherence associated with the quantum beats ; whereas the entanglement with the phonon or photon bath leads to static coherence associated with non - canonical thermal distributions .",
    "one of the important questions in this discussion is whether electronic coherent dynamics can be initiated by natural sunlight @xcite . in 2des or pump - probe experiments ,",
    "molecules are excited by ultra - short femtosecond laser pulses which lead to a pure quantum state  generally in the form of a superposition of several locally excited states . on the other hand ,",
    "natural thermal light is incoherent : in the semi - classical picture , it can be described as uncorrelated noise that leads to an excitation of populations , but not necessarily coherence . in the quantum picture , it was argued that the arrival of photons does not have to be localized at a particular time nor have a well - defined phase  the thermal light behaves more like a dissipative quantum bath at high temperature with a very short coherence time ( @xmath1 . although there have been many models of the incoherent light excitation @xcite , the exact quantum description of the light , as well as a thorough analysis of its properties over a broad range of parameters , is still not available .",
    "this article aims to fill this gap .",
    "we use the hierarchical equations of motion ( heom ) @xcite as a non - perturbative description of both the phonon bath and photon radiation .",
    "we further introduce a decay channel , which defines an observation window for the induced exciton dynamics . the drude - lorentz spectral density assumed by",
    "the heom differs from the black - body spectrum ; however , in contrast to the classical approach , the heom correctly describes temperature effects and all the relevant quantum effects and allows us to examine the dependence of the induced dynamics on the coherence of the radiation field .    in the first part",
    ", we analyze the dynamics of a closed system pumped by incoherent light . the amount of dynamical coherence ( i.e , the amplitude of oscillations ) generated under sunlight pumping is constant , inversely proportional to the exciton energy gap , but decreases if normalized by the linearly growing exciton populations .",
    "we analyze the amount of dynamic coherence for different coherence times of the radiation and show that for very incoherent radiation , which is the case relevant for the natural sunlight , the white - noise model ( wnm ) provides a reliable description of the optical excitation .",
    "open quantum systems allow the additional dephasing mechanism , which depends on the detailed properties of the system - bath coupling .",
    "our analysis of the closed system aims to demonstrate that the presence of dynamical coherence is not excluded by the fact that solar light is incoherent , provided the additional dephasing of the electronic coherence from the phonon bath is sufficiently slow , as observed in many biological systems .",
    "further analysis of the open system reveals the phonon - induced static coherence , which appears as the long time limit after the dynamic coherence is suppressed by the phonon noise .    in the second part",
    ", we include a decay channel which sets a time - scale for experimental observation on the individual molecule level .",
    "physically , the decay channel can be interpreted as trapping at the reaction center , fluorescence emission , or non - radiative decay  @xcite .",
    "the density matrix formalism is a general tool to evaluate experimental results in the framework of dissipative quantum dynamics .",
    "however , it does not necessarily tell us about the state of individual molecules , which is an issue closely related to the measurement problem in single molecule experiments .",
    "the statistical interpretation of the density matrix formalism offers a mechanism in which the pure quantum state of individual molecules can survive for long times , and the observed loss of coherence is attributed to ensemble averaging or time averaging , which results in cancelation of phase coherence in states with different quantum phases .",
    "this type of decoherence often applies to dynamical coherence .",
    "in contrast , because of the coupling to phonons , the coherence is lost even on the level of individual molecules after the trace over the bath is performed .",
    "this type of decoherence mainly applies to static coherence .",
    "we can not differentiate these two types of coherence based on the density matrix description but can distinct them on the single molecule level , which will be further discussed in a future publication .",
    "for example , in ensemble measurements , there is not a particular event to set time zero in our experiment , and one thus has to be careful about the initial condition  @xcite .",
    "we try to avoid these interpretational issues by introducing a decay channel , which introduces a natural time - scale for energy transfer and establish the non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "then , the contribution of light - induced dynamical coherence to light - harvesting energy transfer is determined by the ratio of the dephasing time and decay time , and may not play a dominant role in light - harvesting systems , such as fmo or lh2 .     to the ground state .",

    "the system of interest is a molecular dimer in contact with sunlight and two independent phonon baths , which represent both vibrational dof of the molecules and the nuclear dof of the surrounding environment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system - schema ] ) .",
    "this model captures the essential physics of delocalized exciton states and coherent exciton dynamics relevant for light - harvesting systems .",
    "the molecular dimer system has been extensively studied in quantum information , quantum optics , and frster energy transfer theory  @xcite .",
    "each molecule , denoted by an index @xmath3 , is either in its electronic ground state @xmath4 or its electronic excited states @xmath5 ( i.e. , excitons ) . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the composite states @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we remove the @xmath10-state from our model since its influence is negligible due to its high energy .",
    "then , the molecular dimer can be described by the system hamiltonian @xmath11 where the energies of states @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are denoted @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath2 denotes the exciton resonance - coupling .",
    "the two - level - system hamiltonian in the excited state manifold can be diagonalized in the excitonic basis consisting of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . throughout this paper",

    "we use the over - damped harmonic bath egcf @xcite , i.e. , the drude - lorentz spectral density , which is paramertized by the radiation temperature @xmath40 , cutoff frequency @xmath41 and reorganization energy @xmath42 ( see appendix a ) . in the weak excitation regime , the excited state density matrix is proportional to @xmath42 , which can now be taken a normalization constant and needs not be specified . as this point",
    ", we have introduced the system hamiltonian @xmath43 and radiation - system interaction hamiltonian @xmath44 , and thus have completely defined a closed dimer system pumped by sunlight .",
    "light - harvesting complexes are embedded in the protein environment and therefore are open systems coupled to phonon baths .",
    "this coupling destroys the dynamic coherence and is described as  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the interaction strength between the molecule and its phonon bath .",
    "similar to the photon bath , we use the drude - lorentz phonon spectral density and define the egcf as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a linear function of phonon operators expressed in the interaction picture with respect to the phonon bath . for simplicity , the phonon baths coupled to the two molecules share the same parameters : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in the range of @xmath52 .",
    "to calculate photon - coupling and phonon - coupling , we use the hierarchical equation of motion ( heom ) , which are developed for the debye - lorentz spectral density .",
    "details of heom can be found in the appendix b. because of the high - temperature and extremely short coherence time of the sunlight , the white noise description of the excitation by solar radiation is reliable , where the radiation field is treated classically .",
    "hence , in absence of the exciton - phonon interaction , we have derived an analytical solution based on the haken - strobl model @xcite to describe the pumping by the sunlight .",
    "we present this white - noise model ( wnm ) in the following .",
    "the full quantum treatment of the incoherent light in the form of heom is computationally expensive .",
    "if the coherence time of the solar radiation is shorter than all other time - scales of the system dynamics , including the resonance coupling , the phonon bath time - scale , and the dephasing time , which is typical in photosynthesis , then the white - noise model ( wnm ) should be well applicable for the description of the radiation . in this model ,",
    "the energy gap correlation function ( egcf ) is expressed in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a parameter representing coupling of the electric field to the given exciton transition .",
    "the quantum dynamics under this classical white noise is known as the haken - strobl model , which is exactly solvable in some cases , including the v - shape three - level system with a trap ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can generalize the classical noise to quantum noise by evaluating the redfield pumping rates given as    [ eq : whitenoisesolutionrates ] @xmath55    where @xmath56 denote eigenstate energies and @xmath57 . in the weak field regime , @xmath58 ,",
    "the pumping creates no more than one excitation at any given time such that @xmath59 .",
