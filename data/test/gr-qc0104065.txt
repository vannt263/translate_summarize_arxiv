    "the classical cosmology based on the equations of general relativity involving the principles of thermodynamics , hydrodynamics , the plasma theory and the field theory comes across a number of conceptual difficulties known as the problems of standard big - bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "these are the problems of singularity , size , age , flatness , total entropy and total mass of the universe , large - scale structure , dark matter , isotropy of the cosmic background radiation and others .",
    "the various models were proposed for the solution of these problems .",
    "the inflationary model @xcite is the most popular one .",
    "there are alternative approaches which use the idea that in the early universe the fundamental constants ( velocity of light , gravitational constant , fine - structure constant ) had the values different from the modern @xcite .",
    "the observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) indicate that our universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "this conclusion which appeared as partly unexpected for the cosmologists a few years ago nowadays practically does not called in question @xcite .",
    "the concept of a dark energy was proposed for the explanation of this phenomenon @xcite and the modern investigations in this field are directed toward filling of this idea with concrete contents @xcite .",
    "the presence of the cosmological problems points to incompleteness of our knowledge about the universe .",
    "it is generally accepted that the conclusions of classical theory of gravity can not be extrapolated to the very early epoch . at the planck",
    "scales one must take into account the quantum effects of both matter and gravitational fields .",
    "there can not be any doubt that our universe today contains the structural elements which bear the traces of comprehensive quantum processes in preceding epochs .",
    "the small cosmic microwave background anisotropy and observed large - scale structure of the universe @xcite can be given as necessary examples ( see below ) .",
    "the application of basic ideas underlying quantum theory to a system of gravitational and matter fields runs into difficulties of a fundamental character which do not depend on the choice of a specific model .",
    "the problem of separation of true degrees of freedom under the construction of quantum gravity becomes of fundamental importance @xcite .",
    "it is commonly thought that the main reason behind such difficulties is that there is no natural way to define a spacetime event in general covariant theories @xcite . at the present time",
    "these difficulties are not overcome in the most advanced versions of quantum gravity .",
    "also the quantum gravity can not rely on experimental data @xcite .",
    "therefore it is appropriate to construct the consistent quantum theory within the framework of the simple ( toy ) exactly soluble cosmological model .",
    "as it is well known the model of a homogeneous , isotropic universe ( friedmann - robertson - walker model ) describes good enough the general properties of our universe . in this paper",
    "we study the model of quantum universe proposed in @xcite .",
    "it does not meet with the problems mentioned above and comes to the frw model with positive spatial curvature within the limits of large quantum numbers .    in section 2",
    "we propose the method of removing ambiguities in specifying the time variable in the frw model by means of modification of the action functional and find the solutions of obtained classical field equations .",
    "the section 3 is devoted to the quantum theory for a system of gravitational and matter fields . here",
    "we formulate the equation which is an analog of the schrdinger equation and turns into the wheeler - dewitt one for the minisuperspace model in special case .",
    "we concentrate our attention on study of the quantum universe which can be found in a region that is accessible to a classical motion inside the effective barrier formed by the interaction of the fields .",
    "we discuss the properties of the wave function of the universe and study the universe in low - lying and highly exited quasistationary states on the basis of exact solution of proposed quantum equation . in this section",
    "we calculate the proper dimension of the nonhomogeneities of matter density and the amplitude of the fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation temperature in highly exited state of the universe and propose a new possible quantum mechanism of their origin .",
    "the results are compared with the observed parameters of our universe .",
    "the flatness of the universe and the large value of the entropy today receive their natural explanation .",
    "the observed accelerated expansion emerges as a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum nature of the universe .    throughout the paper the notation _ universe _ ( with capital letter u ) relates to our universe , while _ universe _",

    "the energy density will be measured in units @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 plays the role of a lagrange multiplier , and the variation @xmath18 leads to the constraint equation @xmath19 .",
    "the structure of the constraint is such that true dynamical degrees of freedom can not be singled out explicitly . in the model being considered , this difficulty is reflected in that the choice of the time variable is ambiguous ( the problem of time ) . for the choice of the time coordinate to be unambiguous",
    ", the model must be supplemented with a coordinate condition .",
    "when the coordinate condition is added to the field equations , their solution can be found for chosen time variable .",
    "however , this method of removing ambiguities in specifying the time variable does not solve the problem of a quantum description .",
    "therefore we shall use another approach and remove the above ambiguity with the aid of a coordinate condition imposed prior to varying the action functional .",

    "( @xmath36 is the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field . )    from the analysis of the einstein equations for this model it follows that inclusion of the coordinate condition ( [ 3 ] ) in the action functional leads to the origin of the additional energy - momentum tensor in these equations @xmath37 that can be interpreted as the energy - momentum tensor of radiation . in the ordinary units @xmath28 is measured in @xmath38 .",
    "the choice of radiation as the matter reference frame is natural for the case in which relativistic matter ( electromagnetic radiation , neutrino radiation , etc . ) is dominant at the early stage of universe evolution . if our universe were described by the model specified by action functional ( [ 4 ] )",
    ", it would be possible to relate the above radiation at the present era to cosmic microwave background .",
    "a feature peculiar to the model in question is that it involves a barrier in the variable @xmath10 described by the function @xmath39 .",
    "this barrier is formed by the interaction of the scalar and gravitational fields .",
    "it exists for any form of the positive definite scalar - field potential @xmath40 and becomes impenetrable on the side of small @xmath10 in the limit @xmath41 . in general case ( @xmath42 ) there are two regions accessible to a classical motion : inside the barrier ( @xmath43 ) and outside the barrier ( @xmath44 ) , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the turning points ( @xmath47 ) specified by the condition @xmath48 .",

    "the solution to equation ( [ 6 ] ) can be refined by taking into account a slow variation of the field @xmath35 with the aid of the equation @xmath56 where @xmath54 stands for a potential term .",
    "the solutions of the equation ( [ 91 ] ) which determine the scalar field dynamics were studied in the inflationary models @xcite .",

    "we concentrate our attention on study of the properties of the universe which is characterized by the nonzero values of @xmath28 ( and @xmath54 ) at the initial instant of time and can be found in a region that is accessible to a classical motion inside the barrier .",
    "the evolution of the universe depends on the initial distribution of the classical field @xmath0 and its subsequent behavior as a function of time .",
    "the solutions of the equation ( [ 91 ] ) for @xmath80 give evidence that the @xmath0 decreases with time @xcite . from equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , it follows that the inequality @xmath81 holds in the expanding universe .",
    "if @xmath71 decreases with time , @xmath54 can increase .",

    "it indicates that @xmath82 should increase in the evolution process .",
    "this increase can be explained by a considerable redistribution of energy between the scalar field and radiation at the initial stage of universe existence .",
    "quantum theory is able to account for this phenomenon in a natural way as spontaneous transition from one quantum state of the universe to another ( see below ) .",
    "let us estimate the size of the classical universe in the region @xmath43 taking into account that the parameter @xmath54 can take different values .",
    "such universe by definition can not tunnel through the barrier into the region @xmath44 and by this reason will evolve in time remaining inside the barrier . assuming for simplicity that the universe has expanded according to the law @xmath91^{1/2}$ ] for two instants of time @xmath92 and @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94 where subscripts denote that the corresponding values are given for the values @xmath95 at the instants of time @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "the accelerated expansion is described by the negative values of the deceleration parameter @xmath295 in order to agree the experimental data with the theory it was proposed the concept of the dark energy which is nearly smoothly distributed in space .",
    "this dark energy component must have negative pressure that overcomes the gravitational self - attraction of matter and causes the accelerated expansion of the universe .",

    "when the field @xmath35 descends to a minimum of the potential @xmath40 and begins to oscillate about this minimum , it appears to be a source of the particles of some averaged matter filling the visible volume of the universe , which has linear dimensions on the order of @xmath348 .",
