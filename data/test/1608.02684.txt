    "in either case , a clear peak persists at the nn distance of 2.91   , indicating that rather significant ferromagnetic correlations among nn spins exist at least up to 300  k.    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpdfscale](b ) , we display the temperature dependence of the refined mpdf scale factor for two models : the long - range ferromagnetic model for fits up to 10    ( blue squares ) , and a model containing only the nn spins for fits up to 4    ( red circles , multiplied by 1/2 for clarity ) .",
    "the longer - range model shows a significant upturn around 180  k on cooling in an order - parameter - like fashion , as expected for the development of long - range magnetic order . on the other hand ,",
    "the scale factor for the nn model remains quite large at all temperatures and shows only a modest increase below 180  k , indicating that the nn ferromagnetic correlations remain relatively strong at all temperature measured .",
    "the three main findings introduced in this paper are ( 1 ) the observation of a response in the atomic structure around ; ( 2 ) the existence of very a short - range , symmetry - lowering structural distortion present in both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases ; and ( 3 ) a robust ferromagnetic coupling between nn mn spins persisting up to 300  k , with ferromagnetic correlations for more distant neighbors disappearing above . with regard to the average structure ,",
    "the kink in the tetragonal lattice parameters around the magnetic ordering temperature is consistent with the well - known phenomenon of volume magnetostriction observed in other ferromagnets such as nickel or iron . by extrapolating the linear trend of the volume above 250  k for the ( 0.3 , 0.15 ) sample , we can estimate the magnetostriction quantity @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the difference between the observed and extrapolated volume , to be approximately @xmath43 at .",
    "this has the same sign and order of magnitude as ferromagnetic nickel,@xcite indicating relatively strong magnetoelastic coupling in .    with regard to the local orthorhombic structure",
    ", its robust presence in the doped samples and absence in the parent compound bazn@xmath6as@xmath6 compound suggests that the impurity atoms induce local lattice distortions .",
    "the distorted structure involves significant displacements of the zn / mn and as atoms , suggesting that the mn impurities play a more important role in the local distortion than the k impurities .",
    "indeed , mn impurities are known to cause local distortions of the mnas@xmath21 tetrahedra in other dfs systems such as ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n .  @xcite our results indicate that the mnas@xmath21 tetrahedra in  are likewise distorted locally , with the mnas@xmath21 tetrahedra undergoing an overall expansion .",
    "steric effects associated with the different sizes of the zn and mn ions may contribute to this local distortion . to investigate this possibility , we calculated the bond valence sums ( bvs s ) for the zn@xmath5 and mn@xmath5 ions using the refined atomic positions from the average tetragonal model and the local orthorhombic model .",
    "for the ( 0.3 , 0.15 ) sample at 300  k , the zn bvs s are 1.64 and 1.59 for the tetragonal and orthorhombic models , respectively ; for mn , the bvs s are 2.27 and 2.20 .",
    "the significant difference between the zn and mn bvs s indeed suggests that different local environments would be expected around zn and mn ions .",
    "a plausible interpretation is that the structure relaxes locally around the mn and zn atoms such that the mn - as and zn - as bonds can approach their ideal lengths  @xcite . for mn , which has a slightly larger atomic radius than zn , this results in a net expansion of the mnas@xmath21 tetrahedra relative to the znas@xmath21 tetrahedra , albeit in an asymmetrical fashion .",
    "after periodic averaging ( i.e. in the crystallographic picture ) , the refined lattice parameters and bond lengths converge to some average value intermediate between the shorter zn - as bonds and the longer mn - as bonds , with slightly enlarged atomic displacement parameters .",
    "the different local bonding environments of zn and mn likely contribute to the observed local symmetry lowering .    to check for the possibility of phase segregation into zn - rich and mn - rich regions , we performed fits with a two - phase model , one phase solely with zn and one solely with mn .",
    "this two - phase model yielded an equally good fit as the single - phase orthorhombic model when restricted to 6    and below , but for fits performed over longer @xmath19-ranges , the single - phase tetragonal model fit just as well or better , suggesting that there is no tendency for zn and mn segregation on length scales longer than approximately 5   .",
    "this is consistent with previous neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation data , which also found no evidence for an inhomogeneous distribution of mn ions .",
    "we now discuss the mpdf results , which revealed a strong ferromagnetic peak at the mn - mn nn distance and somewhat weaker ferromagnetic peaks at higher @xmath19 for the doped compounds , while the compound with no k content displayed no mpdf signal .",
    "the relatively weak longer - range mpdf signal in the doped samples is not necessarily surprising , considering that even the high - resolution , low - noise neutron diffraction measurements reported earlier  @xcite detected no signature of the ferromagnetic order that was seen by  @xcite .",
    "the present mpdf findings may help reconcile the apparent inconsistency of the previous neutron and  results ; as a probe of local magnetism ,  is sensitive to even very short - range magnetic correlations such as the strong nn correlations revealed by mpdf , while standard analysis of magnetic bragg peaks is only applicable to long - range magnetic order and is insensitive to short - range correlations .",
    "the persistence of the nn mpdf signal above , which is in contrast to the disappearance of the  signal above , suggests a change in time scale of the magnetic correlations : above , the correlations fluctuate on shorter time scales that render them invisible to  but still observable in the diffuse neutron diffraction signal and mpdf .",
    "the presence of robust ferromagnetic correlations between nn spins suggested by the neutron data is in contrast to the two first - principles studies performed on this system ,  @xcite which both predict antiferromagnetic coupling of nn spins due to short - range superexchange between neighboring mn spins mediated by the as anions .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the mn ions exist in a highly asymmetrical local environment , with significantly different bond lengths and angles formed by the neighboring as anions .",
    "this could reduce the efficiency of the antiferromagnetic superexchange and allow the hole - mediated ferromagnetic exchange or some other mechanism to dominate instead .",
    "to our knowledge , the previous studies assumed the long - range tetragonal structure reported previously ,  @xcite and so would not have included any of the possible effects of the lower local symmetry reported in the present paper .",
    "a calculation of the magnetic interactions given the local distortion revealed by the pdf data is beyond the scope of this paper but would be a worthwhile endeavor .",
    "the theoretical studies further suggest that the as anions could also become spin - polarized .",
    "@xcite however , the expectation is that the as magnetic moments would be very small compared to the mn spins .",
    "since the magnitude of the mpdf contribution of a pair of spins is proportional to the product of the two spins , contributions from as moments would be difficult to detect in the mpdf data .",
    "an experimental fact that may be difficult to reconcile with the picture of ferromagnetically coupled nn spins is that the saturated net magnetic moment tends to be @xmath231 - 2  @xmath7 per mn , significantly smaller than would be expected from a full contribution of all the @xmath11 spins .",
    "the formation of antiferromagnetic nn pairs has often been invoked to explain this discrepancy , with which the claim of ferromagnetic nn spin pairs is clearly not consistent . on the other hand , there are other mechanisms that could also reduce the local moment size .",
    "for instance , it is known from recent x - ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy that the mn 3@xmath44 orbitals strongly hybridize with the as 4@xmath10 orbitals , which can also significantly reduce the local moment .",
    "in addition , local structural distortions in ( ga , mn)as have been predicted to reduce the mn moment ,  @xcite which could also be the case for the local distortion in .",
    "some combination of these and other effects may explain the observed reduced ferromagnetic moment while remaining consistent with our observation of significant mn nn ferromagnetic coupling .",
    "nevertheless , this puzzling situation requires further investigation .",
    "we have performed pdf analysis of x - ray and neutron total scattering measurements conducted on several compositions of . the atomic pdf analysis revealed that the average crystallographic structure retains its tetragonal structure at all temperatures , but the unit cell volume shows an anomaly at the ferromagnetic ordering temperature , consistent with volume magnetostriction .",
    "in addition , a well - defined local orthorhombic distortion with asymmetric displacements of the as and zn / mn atoms exists on a very short length scale of @xmath0   . on cooling , the orthorhombic distortion gradually relaxes back to the average tetragonal structure , although the local environment of the zn / mn and as sites remains distorted .",
    "the neutron pdf data are consistent with this local orthorhombic distortion and also indicate robust short - range , ferromagnetic alignment of nn mn spins along the @xmath1 axis that persists well above , along with somewhat weaker ferromagnetic correlations among further mn neighbors that increase below the expected magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "the existence of a lower - symmetry local structure and ferromagnetic ( rather than antiferromagnetic ) coupling of nn mn spins are both unexpected results that may have significant implications for the mechanism of ferromagnetism in this system .",
