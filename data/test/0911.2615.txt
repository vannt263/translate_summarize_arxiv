    "many important phenomena occurring in first order phase transformations , such as nucleation and growth , are controlled by interfacial properties . in the theory of solidification ,",
    "one such property is the solid - liquid interfacial free energy @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter controls the barrier for nucleation of a solid in an undercooled liquid and the transitions between planar , cellular and dendritic growth regimes in metals , which in turn governs their final microstructure @xcite . despite its importance for both theoretical models and practical applications , accurate data for the value of @xmath0are",
    "not known even for the case of simple elements .",
    "there are indeed few experimental techniques aimed at measuring this quantity ( for a comprehensive review see ref.@xcite ) and their application is complicated by the very strict control on all experimental parameters that must be achieved to obtain accurate data .",
    "one such method for example involves recovering @xmath0indirectly from nucleation - rate measurements @xcite . in this case ,",
    "large uncertainties in the measured values arise from the possible occurrence of heterogeneous nucleation from very low - concentration impurities .",
    "reliable theoretical values would therefore be very useful .",
    "several methods have been developed to calculate @xmath0from _ in - silico _ experiments with molecular dynamics , where complete control of the `` experimental '' variables is achievable .",
    "these methods are the capillary fluctuation method ( cfm ) @xcite , different sorts of so - called `` cleaving '' methods ( cm ) @xcite and a classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) approach @xcite . in cfms the fluctuation spectrum of the interface height is related to the interfacial stiffness @xmath1 ( where the second derivative is taken with respect to an angle @xmath2 defining the crystallographic orientation of the surface ) through which @xmath0can be recovered by calculating @xmath3 for different interface orientations and fitting the results to an expansion of @xmath0 in kubic harmonics @xcite . in cms ,",
    "as the name suggests , bulk solid and liquid phases are separately cleaved and the different phases are joined to form an interface . in this way , @xmath0is recovered by measuring the work done during the process .",
    "finally , in the cnt approach , crystalline nuclei of different sizes are inserted into a supercooled liquid and some orientational average of @xmath0is recovered by measuring the radius of the critical nucleus @xmath4 and inserting its value in the classical nucleation theory equation relating @xmath4 and @xmath0(see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , page 46 ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the literature for details of these calculations .",
    "successful applications of the aforementioned methods have been reported for model systems such as hard spheres @xcite and lennard - jones potentials @xcite as well as more realistic semiempirical and quantum - mechanical @xcite based embedded atom @xcite and stillinger - weber @xcite potentials .",
    "the cfm and cnt are derived with macroscale approximations and thus require large simulation supercells of about @xmath5 atoms to be applicable and give accurate results .",
    "cleavage methods require somewhat smaller supercells ( @xmath6 atoms ) but are prone to the error introduced if the sequence of simulations is not completely reversible .",
    "a dramatic example would be the complete solidification of the liquid while joining it to the solid due to a large relative fluctuation in the position of the interface @xcite .",
    "the simulation supercell must contain a relatively large area of interface in order to avoid the occurrence of these events .",
    "moreover , to compute @xmath0accurately and efficiently , one has to use a cleaving potential which mimics accurately the interactions between the system s particles @xcite .",
    "this must be built in an _ ad hoc _",
    "way for every system and can become cumbersome when complex many - body interactions have to be taken into account such as for example in _ ab - initio_-based calculations .",
    "these shortcomings become particularly troublesome if one consider that interface free energies are very sensitive to the details of the empirical potential ; for instance , different parameterizations of eam potentials yield values of @xmath0which vary by as much as 30% @xcite . in order to capture the complex bonding and the unusual local environments present at the solid - liquid interface , and to capture accurately the anisotropy of crystalline surface energies",
    ", one must consider more sophisticated models , which reproduce more closely the first - principles total energy .    in the present paper ,",
    "we discuss a novel technique to compute @xmath0which aims at being robust , efficient and transferable , and which is a promising candidate to extend the scope of interfacial energy calculations to more complex potentials than previously treated .",
    "briefly , our method reconstructs a coarse - grained free energy surface ( fes ) using metadynamics@xcite .",
    "such a fes maps out the transition from a single phase to the space of configurations where two phases coexist .",
    "the minimum difference in gibbs free energy between these two regions at the solid - liquid equilibrium temperature is an excess free energy @xmath7 , which is equivalent to the interface free energy @xmath0multiplied by the area @xmath8 of the interface . +",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the thermodynamic basis and the details of the method . in section iii",
    "we describe the computational details of our simulations . in section",
    "iv we show our results for a simple lennard - jones system and critically discuss them in comparison with other available methods .",
    "we also speculate on the possibility of implementing this approach together with _",
    "ab - initio _ molecular dynamics .",
    "finally , we summarize our main results .",
    "we consider a homogeneous solid or liquid system of @xmath9 atoms , located in a periodically repeated supercell within an infinite system , at a pressure @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 .",
    "its gibbs free energy @xmath12 can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the chemical potential of atoms in the solid ( liquid ) phase . at the melting temperature @xmath15 ,",
    "the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal @xmath16    there exists a second state of the same system at the melting temperature , in which solid and liquid phases coexist , separated by macroscopically planar interfaces that are naturally fluctuating on the atomic scale . since the chemical potential in the solid and liquid bulk phases at @xmath15 is identical , one can write the overall gibbs free energy as @xmath17 where an excess energy term associated with the interface has been introduced . such a term will be extensive with respect to the area of the interface , and we can write it as the product of the surface area @xmath8 and an interface free energy @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath18 .    the most direct approach to the computation of @xmath0is clearly to calculate the free - energy difference between the bulk phases and the configurations in which planar interfaces are present , as described by eqs .",
    "[ eq : gibbs - bulk ] and  [ eq : gibbs - interface ] respectively .",
    "we will obtain this free - energy difference by means of metadynamics simulations , as described in the next section .",
    "the use of metadynamics for reconstructing free - energy landscapes has been the subject of many papers and we refer the reader to the excellent review by laio and gervasio and references therein @xcite , while we only briefly sketch the main ideas here .",
    "metadynamics is a simulation technique based on non - equilibrium molecular dynamics , which is designed to reconstruct a coarse - grained free energy surface ( fes ) in the space of one or more collective variables @xmath19 that describe the state of the system .",
    "metadynamics reconstructs the fes by adding a bias potential in the form of a gaussian centered at a specific point in the collective variable ( cv ) space each time that point is visited .",
    "the mathematical form of the bias potentials is given by    @xmath20    which in the discrete version needed to implement the algorithm for computations becomes @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the inverse of the frequency of deposition of the gaussians , and @xmath23 is the number of gaussians accumulated up to time @xmath24 in the simulation .",
    "@xmath25 is the deposition rate of the gaussian functions and @xmath26 their width .    ) , during a metadynamics simulation in a one - dimensional collective variable space .",
    "we show the underlying fes @xmath27 and the bias accumulated at chosen times ( arbitrary units ) . for a sufficiently long simulation , @xmath28 , so that one can obtain an accurate estimate of the free - energy surface simply by taking the negative of the bias .",
    "[ fig : metadyn ] ]    the bias discourages the trajectory from remaining indefinitely in the same region of the cv space , effectively pushing the system towards the lowest - lying free - energy barrier .",
    "once all the relevant free energy minima have been levelled by the bias ( see figure  [ fig : metadyn ] ) , the system becomes completely diffusive and wanders freely through all the possible states .    at this stage of the simulation",
    "the accumulated bias is equal to the negative of the free energy of the real system plus an additive constant ( for a detailed analysis see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , there are two limitations in this original form of metadynamics .",
    "first of all it is not clear when a metadynamics simulation should be stopped , i.e. when the bias has effectively compensated the underlying free energy .",
    "moreover , even at this point , the effective fes will have a residual roughness of the order of the height of each individual gaussian ( @xmath29 in equation [ eq : v - meta - discreet ] ) . in order to resolve these issues , the so - called `` well - tempered '' metadynamics method",
    "@xcite has been proposed recently by barducci _",
    "et al . _ , and we use this specific type of metadynamics in our simulations .",
    "the idea behind well - tempered metadynamics is to gradually reduce the height of the deposited gaussians , at a rate determined by the magnitude of the bias already present .",
    "the expression analogous to  ( [ eq : v - meta - continuous ] ) reads @xmath30 the parameter @xmath31 controls how quickly the deposition rate is reduced . once the simulation approaches convergence",
    ", the collective variables space will be sampled with a probability distribution corresponding to an artificial temperature @xmath32@xcite .",
    "hence , the final bias accumulated during a single simulation converges to @xmath33 the true free energy can be recovered inverting equation  ( [ eq : welltempered2 ] ) .    as in any free - energy calculation based on the mapping of the configurations of the system to a coarse - grained collective - variable space ,",
    "the definition of cvs that can effectively distinguish between relevant states , and describe reliably the natural transformation path is the first , and most important step .",
    "the primary requirement is to distinguish the solid phase from the liquid . with this aim ,",
    "we define for every atom an order parameter @xmath34 , which depends on the relative position of its neighbors .",
    "the definition of @xmath34 @xmath35 contains an angular term @xmath36 to distinguish the different environments , and some radial cutoff functions @xmath37 which are useful to guarantee that @xmath34 is a continuous function of all its arguments .",
    "note that the weighted sum of @xmath36 is normalized over the total coordination , so that @xmath34 is relatively insensitive to fluctuations of the density .",
    "as defined in equation [ eq : c - alpha ] .",
    "the function is shown as a polar plot , centered on an _ fcc _ lattice .",
    "@xmath36 has well - defined peaks in the directions of the nearest neighbors . ]",
    "we define the angular function @xmath36 as a combination of polynomials in cartesian coordinates , symmetry adapted to the cubic point group : @xmath38\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathbf{x}\\right|^8 } \\end{split } \\label{eq : c - alpha}\\ ] ] we have chosen eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - alpha ] ) rather than more traditional parameters such as the so - called @xmath39 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , for a number of reasons : @xmath36 has well - defined peaks for an _ fcc _ environment ( see figure  [ fig : c - alpha ] ) , it is not rotationally invariant ( and will therefore enforce an orientation of the crystal consistent with the periodic boundaries ) and it is relatively cheap to compute .",
    "it would possible to construct a different form of @xmath40 if one wanted to deal with a different crystal structure , and one simply has to rotate the function in order to specify a different crystallographic orientation of the surface .",
    "the application of a specialised , orientation - dependent order parameter is a key ingredient of our approach .",
    "the radial cutoff is defined as @xmath41 & r_1<r < r_0\\\\ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 . the polynomial part in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - r ] ) is simply a third order polynomial satisfying the constraints of continuity of @xmath43 and its first derivative at @xmath44 and @xmath45 . + in order to study the formation of a solid - liquid interface , one must then distinguish configurations where the supercell is completely solid , completely liquid , or partially solid and partially liquid : in the latter case , at least two parallel interfaces will be present . for this purpose",
    "we divide the supercell , centered at the origin , into two regions : we assign to region a those atoms having @xmath46 , and to region b all the others ( see figure  [ fig : z - weight ] ) .",
    "note that we take @xmath47 to be about one fourth of the supercell length along @xmath48 , and we keep it constant irrespective of the fluctuations of the supercell s size .",
    "this choice is not troublesome as long as the averages are properly normalized , so that the value of the cvs is independent of the number of atoms contained in each of the regions .",
    "again , in order to obtain smoothly - varying cvs , we introduce a weight function .",
    "we use the same functional form introduced for the radial cutoff ; namely , @xmath49 , setting @xmath50 , @xmath51 in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : c - r ] ) .",
    "we finally define our cvs @xmath52 and @xmath53 by averaging the order parameters of the atoms located within region @xmath8 and @xmath54 , respectively : @xmath55/\\sum_i \\left[1-c_z(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\right ]   \\end{split } \\label{eq : sasb}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 this scaling has been chosen so that @xmath57 in a homogeneous liquid and @xmath58 in a perfect _ fcc _ solid .",
    "in order to evaluate our method , we decided to perform the metadynamics calculations with a truncated lennard - jones potential , in the form used by broughton and gilmer @xcite .",
    "such a simple potential is inexpensive and thoroughly studied , yet it can capture many of the relevant physical phenomena occurring in real systems .",
    "its solid - liquid transition , an important ingredient of our approach , has been recently studied by mastny and de pablo @xcite through a modified wang - landau sampling technique @xcite .",
    "therefore , this system is ideal for a systematic study with our method , comparing it with other techniques and benchmarking its performance as a function of the parameters of the simulation .",
    "we will use lennard - jones units throughout the paper .",
    "the zero pressure coexistence temperature for this system has been recently recalculated and we take it to be @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "details of the phase diagram can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we performed our simulations with a range of supercell sizes from @xmath60 _ fcc _ unit cells ( 384 atoms ) to @xmath61 ( 6480 atoms ) .",
    "the supercells were oriented with _ fcc _",
    "@xmath62 $ ] cell vectors parallel to the axes , with the longest side parallel to @xmath48 , and were rescaled to a volume consistent with the equilibrium density of the solid at the coexistence temperature .",
    "atomic positions were then equilibrated at @xmath15 by performing a short molecular dynamics simulation in the canonical ( nvt ) ensemble .",
    "this procedure was adopted in order to generate the starting configurations for the subsequent metadynamics simulations , which we perform instead in the isothermal - isobaric ( npt ) ensemble .",
    "the timestep for the integration of the equations of motion , performed with a velocity verlet algorithm @xcite , was @xmath63 .",
    "this choice gave negligible drift of the conserved quantity in all our simulations .    in order to perform constant pressure simulations , variable - cell dynamics",
    "is implemented using a langevin - piston barostat@xcite and a friction of @xmath64  ps@xmath65 .",
    "the presence of an interface calls for particular attention when performing constant - pressure simulations . in particular",
    ", one has to deal with the change in density that occurs when a portion of the supercell melts , at the same time considering fluctuations in the @xmath66-plane .",
    "if the @xmath66-plane parameters of the supercell are fixed , the fluctuations in the solid will be frustrated ; on the other hand , if those parameters are left free to vary , one will witness a spurious shrinking of the dimensions in the @xmath66-plane due to surface tension whenever an interface is present . in both cases",
    "one can in principle observe a strain - related free energy contribution .",
    "however , this problem would disappear in the thermodynamic limit , hence one can just make the choice that is more computationally convenient , and consider the resulting error as another finite - size effect , which can be controlled by comparing the results with different supercell sizes .",
    "we decided to let only the @xmath48 component free to fluctuate . in this way",
    ", the change of volume occurring as the fraction of liquid and solid phases changes can be accommodated , and even in case of complete melting the @xmath66 dimensions remain commensurate with a strain - free solid , which makes it simpler for the system to freeze again into a defect - free solid .",
    "temperature control is extremely important in metadynamics simulations , since the increase of the biasing potential creates a continuous supply of energy to the system , which must nevertheless be held close to equilibrium in order to sample the free energy correctly .",
    "a strong local thermostat is needed , but at the same time one must avoid overdamping , which drastically reduces the diffusion coefficient and hence the sampling of slow , collective modes .",
    "we therefore use a colored - noise thermostat  @xcite fitted to provide efficient sampling over a broad range of frequencies , corresponding to vibrational periods between @xmath67 and @xmath68 lennard - jones time units .",
    "the metadynamics we used for the different simulations are reported in table  [ tab : meta_parameters ] .",
    "this table also includes data for a number of tests using a single cv , which we describe later .",
    "we performed tests with other choices of these parameters spanning about an order of magnitude and no statistically significant changes were observed in the calculated value of @xmath0 .",
    "the values reported , however , resulted in the best statistical uncertainty in the final free - energy estimate.the simulations were performed using the dl_poly code ( version 2.18 , @xcite ) , patched to perform metadynamics using the plumed@xcite cross - platform plugin , which greatly reduces the implementation burden by providing a convenient framework for introducing new collective variables . +    .",
    "metadynamics parameters for different simulations ( 1 and 2 dimensional ) and different supercell sizes .",
    "@xmath31 has been chosen such that @xmath69 for every size .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of @xmath70 suffices for this purpose .",
    "@xmath22 was chosen so as to observe the first solid - liquid transition at about half of the total simulation time , and @xmath26 was set to @xmath71 , which is of the order of the thermal fluctuations of the cvs in an unbiased simulation .",
    "[ tab : meta_parameters ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      with the aid of table  [ tab : gammasl_vs_size ] we can now discuss the relative merits of our technique .",
    "first of all it can be seen that our calculated value for the ( 100 ) surface is very close to the ones calculated by cfm(@xmath72 ) and cm ( @xmath73 in ref.@xcite and @xmath74 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "although we can not make such a direct comparison with cnt ( because only an averaged value for @xmath0 , @xmath75 for all possible orientations is given ) we point out that their value of @xmath76 is much lower than ours .",
    "the anisotropy in @xmath0accounts for part of the difference , as the ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces have a lower @xmath0@xcite , but we suggest that the anisotropy is too small to account for all of it . the fact that the value calculated by cnt is much lower than both ours and that of the cfm and cm may also be due to the curvature and temperature dependence of @xmath0 ; cnt is the only method dealing with curved interfaces at temperature below the equilibrium @xmath15 , as noted in @xcite .",
    "we also point out here that we do not neglect the @xmath77 term as done in the first version of the cm approach@xcite , but we still recover a free energy higher than that calculated by cnt .",
    "this should rule out the possibility , as supposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that relaxations in volume during the formation of the interface could be another explanation for the discrepancies in @xmath0 .    in part",
    ", the existence of a small discrepancy between results of cm , cfm and the present work , which rely on similar thermodynamic assumptions , can be explained in terms of differences in the technical details of the calculations .",
    "for instance , in some of the cm calculations temperature - control has been implemented by a non - standard velocity - rescaling method , which might affect the accuracy of sampling of the canonical ensemble . in the present work we have tried to highlight all the possible sources of statistical and systematic error , to facilitate further comparison . in any case , the discrepancy between different numerical approaches is negligible when compared to the errors affecting experiments , which can give results differing by as much as 300% ( see e.g. ref @xcite ) . hence , any of the aforementioned techniques can be extremely valuable in assisting the interpretation of experimental data and the development of new materials .",
    "the small system size required for our simulations will be a particular advantage , since system size is by far the biggest limitation in applying more sophisticated potentials .",
    "we obtain reliable results with system sizes as small as about @xmath78 atoms , more than two order of magnitude smaller than required by both cfms and cnt .",
    "cms require a few thousand atoms , so the advantage is less impressive .",
    "however , we remark that the lower bound attainable by cm is most likely set by the need to mitigate hysteresis effects , while with our metadynamics approach this is not an issue , and the limiting factor here will be the kind of interactions between interfaces that are inevitable in all total energy calculations based on periodic boundary conditions .    in view of the large experimental inaccuracies in the measure of @xmath0(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) even simple empirical potentials would already lead to a quantitative improvement of the knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "we are applying our method to some of these cases and the results will be published in a future paper .",
    "nevertheless , it may be that the accuracy or information given by a self - consistent electronic structure method is desired for the interfacial free energy calculation , in which case our approach would still be a promising candidate . with high performance computers , simulating a few hundred atoms for several hundred picoseconds is within the reach of present , widely used molecular dynamics methods employing so - called _ ab initio _",
    "( electronic density functional ) techniques for the calculation of interatomic forces .",
    "this would probably result in better predictive power and smaller overall errors despite the possibility of mild finite - size effects .    with a view to performing calculations with more sophisticated potentials ,",
    "metadynamics offers a further advantage over the other techniques",
    ". one could implement a process of iterative refining , whereby one performs a sequential set of calculations with potentials of increasing sophistication and computational cost , in order to reduce the burden of levelling the fes .",
    "in fact , the major features of the fes can be captured by the use of very simple potentials reproducing the nearest neighbour bonding in the real material .",
    "this first level fes , @xmath79 , could then be used as the initial bias for a second metadynamics run , to be performed with a more accurate ( and expensive ) potential . at this stage",
    ", one will have the much easier task of correcting the discrepancy between @xmath79 and the fes of the new potential , @xmath80 .",
    "this scheme could be repeated with increasingly accurate potentials .",
    "in the present paper we have presented a novel approach to the calculation of the solid - liquid interface free energy @xmath0 , and discussed its application to the calculation of @xmath0for the @xmath81 surface of a lennard - jones solid in contact with its liquid .",
    "our method is based on the definition of a new order parameter , which is designed to identify _ fcc_-ordering of atoms in the orientation of choice , compatible with the periodic boundary conditions , and uses metadynamics simulations to estimate free - energy differences between the bulk phases and configurations where macroscopically flat interfaces are present .",
    "we obtain results for @xmath0 in good agreement with previously proposed methods .",
    "moreover , our technique offers several advantages compared to previous approaches discussed in the literature .",
    "it requires fewer atoms than those methods based on macroscale approximations , such as measuring capillary fluctuations or the critical nucleation radius , while being less affected by hysteresis than cleavage methods , since the interface is created and destroyed several times during each simulation as equiprobable sampling of the free energy surface is approached .",
    "we discuss at length the different sources of error , and how they can be controlled .",
    "in particular , we show that our approach is effective even for supercells containing fewer than 1000 atoms , with finite - size errors whose importance can be gauged easily . for this reason",
    ", we speculate that it would be possible to perform an _ ab initio _ calculation of @xmath0 , at the level of electronic density functional theory . to this end",
    ", we suggest that an iterative refinement scheme , which starts with a biased free - energy surface computed from a semi - empirical potential , could be a helpful starting point for obtaining converged results within reasonable computational time .",
    "we plan to attempt these calculations in the near future , after having further validated our method by comparison with experiments in the case of a simple metal for which we expect empirical potentials to be adequate .",
