    "the x - ray emission properties of non - accreting neutron stars are today known to be extremely diverse .",
    "there are multiple classes of neutron stars identified  rotation - powered pulsars ( rpps ) , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , thermally emitting isolated neutron stars , central compact objects  to name a few ( see kaspi 2010 , for a review ) , with the basis for classification of a given neutron star into these different classes often being its x - ray emission properties .",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are now well established as being extremely variable in the x - ray range , showing a wide variety of often dramatic bursting behavior during active periods , in addition to lower - level flux and profile variability during periods of relative quiescence ( see woods & thompson 2006 , kaspi 2007 , mereghetti 2008 , and rea & esposito 2011 , for reviews ) .",
    "this variability is ascribed to activity both within the stellar interior as well as in the magnetosphere , both owing ultimately to the decay of these objects extremely high magnetic fields ( @xmath5  g ) , particularly in the context of the now widely accepted magnetar model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , two recent results have lowered the estimated dipolar field strength necessary for magnetar - like activity to well below @xmath6 g ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the young rpp psr  j1846@xmath00258  with @xmath7 g experienced a magnetar - like outburst in 2006 @xcite , while the sgr  0418 + 5729 , discovered via an outburst in 2009 , has an upper limit on its dipole field of @xmath8 g @xcite .",
    "thus , the smallest possible @xmath9 field needed to power a magnetar - like outburst is not currently known .",
    "these recent discoveries highlight the fact that the link between magnetars and rpps is poorly understood .",
    "in particular , it suggests that the x - ray emission of some rpps may be more variable than previously thought .",
    "indeed , a study by @xcite argues that bursting behavior may be generically possible in all rpps , only more common in those that are young and with high @xmath9 .",
    "systematic examinations of the x - ray variability properties of rpps in order to look for other examples of bursting behavior or flux changes has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining a well sampled data set with a single , well calibrated instrument over a long time span .",
    "rotation - powered pulsars are generally too faint for detection with all - sky monitors .",
    "psr b1509@xmath058 is a young , energetic pulsar that was discovered with the _ einstein _ satellite @xcite .",

    "psr b1509@xmath058 presents an excellent opportunity for a systematic , long - term study of a rpp s x - ray emission properties , since it has been observed regularly since 1996 with the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ as a timing calibration source . here",
    "we present a search of 14.7 yr of _ rxte _ data of psr  b1509@xmath058  for pulsed flux variations , pulse profile variations , and magnetar - like bursts .",

    "we use these new data to refine the measurements of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and further quantify the variability of @xmath17 .",

    "we downloaded 290 archival _",
    "rxte _  observations of psr  b1509@xmath058   from the heasarc archive .",
    "all data were collected in the goodxenon mode , which records the arrival time ( 1 @xmath21s resolution ) and energy ( 256 channel resolution ) of each unrejected event .",

    "details for each are included in the following sections .",
    "our timing analysis of psr  b1509@xmath058  follows the common phase - coherent approach , in which we account for each rotation of the pulsar .",

    "in order to produce pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) , we extracted photons from all three xenon layers of each pcu in the 2    30kev energy range ( or 4",
    "  72 channel range ) .",
    "data from the individual pcus were merged and binned at 1/1024s resolution .",
    "the time series were reduced to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter using the known position from radio interferometry ( j2000 ra = @xmath25  @xmath26@xmath27 , dec @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the jpl de200 solar system ephemeris .    when more than one observation occurred in a 24-hr period , we combined the data from multiple observations into a single time series in order to produce better toas and having smaller uncertainties .",
    "each time series was folded with 64 phase bins using an initial ephemeris from @xcite .",
    "resulting pulse profiles were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise - ratio template .",
    "we implemented a fourier domain filter by using six harmonics in the cross - correlation procedure .",
    "cross - correlation produces an average toa for each observation with a typical uncertainty of @xmath310.5ms .",
    "toas were fitted phase coherently with the pulse timing software package ; timing residuals and refined spin parameters are produced as output .",
    "spin parameters for all 14.7yr of x - ray data are given in table  [ table : coherent ] .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : resids ] shows timing residuals with pulse frequency , @xmath22 , frequency derivative , @xmath23 , and second frequency derivative , @xmath24 , fitted .",
    "no sudden jumps were found during the phase connection process , nor were any cusps identified in the timing residuals , indicating that no glitches occurred during the time spanned by the _ rxte _",
    "the middle panel shows residuals with @xmath14 also fitted .",
    "psr  b1509@xmath058  is one of two pulsars with deterministic measurements of @xmath24 and @xmath14 @xcite , however , after the removal of all deterministic parameters , significant structure remains in the timing residuals , as is visible in the middle panel .",
    "this can be attributed to timing noise , a low - frequency or `` red '' noise process that is a common but poorly understood phenomenon in pulsars ( and previously discussed in detail for this pulsar in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . has the capability to fit up to 12 frequency derivatives ; the results of this fit are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : resids ] .",
    "the presence of timing noise is known to contaminate measurements of higher order spin parameters such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 and complicates the proper estimation of uncertainties .",
    "one method of measuring determinsitic parameters and estimating their true uncertainites in the presence of timing noise is discussed in the following section .",
    "one method of finding reliable values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the presence of timing noise is to use a piece - wise approach , deemed `` partially coherent '' timing analysis .",
    "the data are broken into subsets , each of which is fitted phase - coherently with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "for each subset , we require that no structure be visible in the resulting timing residuals . the amount of data included in each subset is determined only by this requirement , so is allowed to vary . on average , the time span in a subset",
    "is @xmath31500days .",
    "the date ranges spanned by these subsets and the resulting ephemerides are given in table  [ table : partial ] ( and are used for our pulsed flux analysis , see section  [ sec : flux ] ) . in order to better sample the available data , we created additional subsets that overlapped the original subsets by @xmath32 .",
    "overlapping subsets are useful since short coherent timing solutions produce fitted parameters dominated by the end points ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : partial ] shows all measurements of @xmath24 both from the current analysis , as well as previous measurements determined using the same method but from both radio and x - ray timing data reported in @xcite .",
    "we performed a weighted least squares fit to measure @xmath14 and a bootstrap error analysis to better estimate the uncertainties , since the data are known to be contaminated with red noise leading to formal uncertainties that underestimate the true uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this analysis results in @xmath33s@xmath34 , in agreement with the previously reported value of @xmath35s@xmath34 , based on 21.3yr rather than 28.4yr of data , but calculated in the same way .",
    "a value of @xmath14 can be used to find a measurement of the `` second '' braking index , @xmath18 , via @xmath36 .",
    "this parameter , a higher order analog to the braking index , @xmath17 , provides a unique test of pulsar spin - down models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the above value of @xmath14 corresponds to a value of @xmath37 , smaller than the value from 21.3yr of data reported in @xcite of @xmath38 , but not significantly so .",
    "we used the same timing solutions to calculate @xmath17 for each data subset as shown in figure  [ fig : braking ] .",
    "the weighted average value , with the uncertainty calculated from a bootstrap analysis is @xmath3 , smaller than the previously reported value of @xmath39 at the 1.6@xmath1 level . in order to look for a linear change in @xmath17 over the entire 28.4yr of observations",
    ", we performed a weighted linear least squares fit to the data .",
    "this results in a slope of @xmath40 , which is consistent with no secular change in @xmath17 at the @xmath41 level .",
    "while the long - term @xmath17 is relatively stable , short - term variability is visible as scatter in the individual measurements , which can most likely be attributed to timing noise , since no discrete jumps in @xmath22 , i.e. glitches , were found .",
    "this amounts to a maximum variation from the average value of @xmath42 , and a root - mean - square variation from the mean of 3.5% .",
    "because of the large scatter in the measurement of @xmath24 near mjd  55000 , which is significantly larger than the mean , we further verified that no glitch occurred in this time period .",
    "in order to determine the pulsed flux of psr  b1509@xmath058  at each epoch , for each observation , we created a phase resolved spectrum with 8 phase bins , for each pcu .",
    "each observation was folded with the software package using the appropriate short coherent ephemeris described in section  [ sec : partial ] and listed in table  [ table : partial ] .",
    "we used these short ephemerides instead of the global solution in part because can take a maximum of two frequency derivatives for an input ephemeris . for psr  b1509@xmath058 ,",
    "using the global two - derivative ephemeris produces very poor pulse profiles because of the effect of the deterministic @xmath14 and timing noise , whereas the profiles produced from short ephemerides are consistently good .",
    "a phase - averaged spectrum was also created in order to build a response matrix for each pcu . for each observation ,",
    "we combined phase - resolved spectra and response matrices for all pcus that were on for @xmath43 of the observation .    from each combined phase - resolved spectrum",
    ", we created a pulse profile with 8 phase bins in the 250kev energy range .",
    "the minimum bin of each profile was used to set the background level , and was subtracted from all bins of the phase - resolved profile .",
    "after background subtraction , we combined the spectra for all phase bins into a single spectrum and fitted the result using . for each observation",
    ", we used a simple power - law model with a fixed spectral index of @xmath44 and fixed @xmath45@xmath46 @xcite , fitting only for the flux .",
    "the resulting fit @xmath47 values showed that this model fit all of our data well .    for short exposure times",
    ", there is an observed anti - correlation between the measured pulsed flux and the source exposure time .",
    "this is a statistical effect present for all sources and disappears when sufficient counts are detected , i.e. for longer exposure times . while one might expect that the uncertainties on pulsed flux measurements would simply increase for short exposures , in addition , the measured pulsed flux is biased upwards .",
    "this arises from poissonian variations , which lead to the minimum bin being biased downward when there are few total counts , thus to an under - estimate of the background and an over - estimate of the pulsed flux .",
    "because the number of active pcus changes from observation to observation , for convenience , we define an `` effective '' observation time of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of pcus on during an observation and @xmath50 is the on - source time . we compared the measured flux values to @xmath51 and found a small bias to be present .",
    "this bias was eliminated by excluding all observations having @xmath52ks , which amounts to 34% of the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : flux ] shows all measurements of the pulsed component of the flux of psr  b1509@xmath058  for observations with @xmath53ks .",
    "vertical lines delimit each of the _ rxte _  epochs ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 3a , 4 ) and the losses of the propane layers in pcu0 ( also referred to as epoch 5 ) and pcu1 .",
    "we verified that there are no significant correlations between the pulsed flux and any of the gain changes or propane layer loss events .",
    "we also measured the pulsed count rate for each observation and note that correlations exist between the pulsed count rate and gain changes and propane layer losses .",
    "in addition , the pulsed count rate decreases gradually by @xmath3110% over the lifetime of _ rxte _ , associated with the long - term degredation of the pca . for these reasons , we report only the pulsed flux values , despite somewhat larger uncertainties .",
    "we note that psr  b1509@xmath058  is listed as a calibration source for _ rxte _  but has only been used as a timing calibrator and not a flux calibration source .",
    "the weighted average 250kev absorbed pulsed flux for all 14.7yr is @xmath54erg@xmath46s@xmath11 , with a @xmath47 value of 52.4 for 150 degrees of freedom .",
    "a weighted linear least - squares fit to the pulsed flux values @xmath55 gives @xmath56erg@xmath46s@xmath11day@xmath11 , that is , consistent with having no linear trend at the 1.9@xmath1 level .",
    "the maximum variation of the pulsed flux of a single observation from the average corresponds to a variability of ( 10@xmath576)% . at the 3@xmath1 level , we can rule out changes on day - to - week time scales of greater than 28% from the average pulsed flux value .",
    "we also studied the flux stability on monthly and yearly time scales by creating weighted averages of individual flux measurements .",
    "average flux values for each _ rxte _  cycle are shown on figure  [ fig : flux ] as filled circles ( colored red in the online version ) on monthly time scales , at the 3@xmath1 level , we rule out variation from the average larger than 20% , while on yearly time scales , the 3@xmath1 upper limit on variability is 21% .",
    "in order to search for variability in the x - ray pulse profile of psr  b1509@xmath058 , we folded each 230kev time series ( as described for the timing analysis in section  [ sec : timing ] ) with the appropriate ephemeris given in table  [ table : partial ] .",
    "previous studies have examined the pulse profile as a function of energy in detail and found that the pulse shape does not change appreciably in the _ rxte _  energy range @xcite , hence we do not repeat this analysis here and concentrate instead on the possibility of the profile changing with time .",
    "first , we analyzed the profiles for individual observations in order to search for variability on time scales of days to months ( i.e. the range of time spans between individual observations ) .",
    "we created a template profile by summing all aligned pulse profiles , shown in figure  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "we subtracted a dc offset from both the individual profiles and template , then normalized the template to each individual profile , subtracted them and found the residuals between the two profiles .",
    "we calculated the reduced @xmath47 of the resulting residuals and in each case , we see no evidence for pulse profile variability . to quantify the lack of profile changes , we calculated the root - mean - square of the profile residuals as a percentage of the number of counts in each dc - offset subtracted profile and found a 3@xmath1 upper limit on variations of 2.1@xmath58 .",
    "next , we created a single profile for each _ rxte _  observing cycle ( spanning @xmath311-yr each ) . in order to check whether there were any small - scale changes in the pulse profile , we compared each profile against the previously described template profile . repeating",
    "the analysis described above , again we found no evidence for variability .",
    "for the yearly profiles , we found a 3@xmath1 upper limit on profile changes of less than 0.1% .",
    "we also compared the profile from each of the 14 _ rxte _  cycles with that of the previous and subsequent cycle profiles .",
    "we normalized each profile and then created residuals between pairs of profiles .",
    "we then performed a @xmath47 test on each set of residuals . in every case ,",
    "@xmath59 , i.e. we detected no evidence of long term changes in the pulse profile . in order to have maximum sensitivity to changes on the longest possible time scales , we also repeated the analysis by comparing the cycle 1 profile with the cycle 14 profile .",
    "again , we found that @xmath59 .",
    "to search for magnetar - like x - ray bursts from psr  b1509@xmath058 , for each observation we created a time series for each active pcu from goodxenon data , selecting events in the 2    20kev range and from all three detection layers ( the same energy range as selected for similar searches for x - ray bursts from axps , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this was repeated several times with different time resolutions , specifically for 15.625ms , 31.25ms , 62.5ms and 125ms , to provide sensitivity to bursts on a hierarchy of time scales .",
    "the procedure used here was based on that described in @xcite .    by this algorithm ,",
    "bursts are identified by comparing the count rate in the i@xmath60 bin to the average count rate .",
    "because the background rate of the pca typically varies over a single observation , we calculated a local mean around the i@xmath60 bin .",
    "we then compared the count rate in the i@xmath60 bin to the local average .",
    "if the count rate in a single bin was larger than the local average , the probability of such a count rate occuring by chance was calculated .",
    "then the probability of the count rate in the corresponding bin in the other active pcus was also calculated ( whether or not the count rate in that bin was greater than the local average ) .",
    "if a pcu was off during the bin of interest , its probability was set to 1 .",
    "we then found the total probability that a burst was observed . if the total probability of an event was @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is the total number of time bins searched ) , it was flagged as a burst .",
    "we searched a total of 751ks of _ rxte _  data using the above described process and found no x - ray bursts from the direction of psr  b1509@xmath058 .",
    "unlike the axps , psr  b1509@xmath058  has a bright pwn which contributes a large unpulsed background to the 1@xmath63 field - of - view of the pca .",
    "because of this larger background , the sensitivity to axp - like x - ray bursts could be significantly smaller than for the axps .",
    "thus , in order to determine the fluence of bursts that would have been detectable in these data , we added simulated bursts to real _ rxte _  time series of psr  b1509@xmath058 .",
    "each simulated burst was confined to a single time bin and spread between the operational pcus .",
    "we added many bursts to each time series , each separated by sufficient time that only one burst would ever be included in a calculation of the running mean .",
    "many bursts were added to each time series in order to include the effect of the variation of the background count rate , largely owing to the variable particle background during the _ rxte _  orbit .",
    "we repeated this analysis for each time resolution searched .",
    "unsurprisingly , we found that the minimum burst fluence required to detect 100% of the simulated bursts is a function of both the number of operational pcus and width of the time bins .    in terms of detected burst count rates ,",
    "the smallest detectable bursts are similar to the smallest bursts detected from the axp  1e  2259 + 586 in its large 2002 outburst @xcite .",
    "for example , for 31.25ms time resolution , 100% of simulated bursts are detected if the burst consisted of 8 or more counts per pcu or more than 25 counts / burst total ( i.e. at least 25 counts per 31.35ms time bin ) . in order to quantify this in terms of burst fluences , we assumed a burst spectrum of a simple power law with spectral index of @xmath64 , as measured for the 80 bursts found from the axp 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite . for 62.5ms time resolutions",
    ", we found that burst fluences of @xmath65erg@xmath46 ( 220kev ) would have been detected , an order of magnitude less than the smallest burst fluence detected from psr  j1846@xmath00258  in its 2006 outburst @xcite .",
    "detectable burst rates and fluences for all searched time resolutions are given in table  [ table : bursts ] , and are valid in the absence of instrumental flares .",
    "thus , we can confidently exclude the possibility that axp - like x - ray bursts with fluences larger than the limits given in table  [ table : bursts ] were present in the _ rxte _  psr  b1509@xmath058data .",
    "we searched for several types of x - ray variability from the young , high-@xmath9 field pulsar psr  b1509@xmath058  and found that the pulsar is stable in each way studied .",
    "this establishes a baseline for the quiescent pulsed flux of psr  b1509@xmath058  in case of a future magnetar - like outburst .",
    "we establish a 3@xmath1 upper limit on pulsed flux variations of less than 28% from the average , ruling out pulsed flux changes similar to those seen in the magnetars and psr  j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "for example , during the 2006 outburst of psr  j1846@xmath00258 , the 260kev pulsed flux as measured with _",
    "rxte_increased by a factor of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the burst search algorithm that has successfully discovered x - ray bursts from several axps and psr  j1846@xmath00258  did not reveal any bursts from the direction of psr  b1509@xmath058 .",
    "we searched 751ks of _",
    "rxte_observations for x - ray bursts , implying that the burst rate must be less than one burst per 751ks .",
    "this is less than the burst rate for psr  j1846@xmath00258 , where 5 x - ray bursts have been observed , implying a burst rate of one per 407ks @xcite .",
    "_ bona fide _ axps have a wide range of observed burst rates , from @xmath67 burst per @xmath31700ks in 1rxs j170849.0@xmath0400910 , up to 1 burst per @xmath3130ks for 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "finally , a study of the x - ray pulse profile of psr  b1509@xmath058  shows no significant variability on time scales of days to years .",
    "variations in individual pulse profiles are constrained to be less than 2.1% from the average profile at the 3@xmath1 level .",
    "together , these results confirm the hypothesis that rpps can have stable x - ray properties on both short- and long - term time scales .",
    "previous studies have shown a correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the soft x - ray band for magnetospheric emission from rpps and their nebular emission @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as a constant value of the conversion of spin - down luminosity into x - ray luminosity , @xmath70 , for all rpps .",
    "establishing a similar correlation between pulsed x - ray luminosity and @xmath68 would be interesting , and implicitly requires @xmath69 to be stable .",
    "prior to this study of psr  b1509@xmath058 , the long - term stability of @xmath69 had not been well established for any pulsar , largely owing to systematic uncertainties when comparing results from different telescopes . here",
    ", we show that @xmath69 can be steady on day - to - year - long time scales for rpps .",
    "this confirms the initial hypothesis , and stands in stark contrast to the magnetars , where @xmath69 varies dramatically .",
    "recent studies have shown that radio emission variability is more common in pulsars than previously thought ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , the radio emission variability seen in the `` intermittent '' pulsars @xcite appears to be associated with large - scale magnetospheric variations .",
    "if such a mechanism were active in psr  b1509@xmath058 , variations in @xmath69 would be expected , and should be visible in our data , along with variations in the x - ray pulse profile . because high - energy pulsar emission is more closely associated with the outer magnetosphere , naively , one might expect more dramatic variations in the x - ray regime than in the energetically unimportant radio regime .",
    "so far this can not be confirmed , because none of the `` intermittent '' pulsars have detectable magnetospheric x - ray pulsations , and no variations in the x - ray pulse profile of psr  b1509@xmath058  were detected here .",
    "interestingly , two high @xmath9-field rpps , psr  j1846@xmath00258  and j1119@xmath06127 , have shown unusual radiative behavior near the time of a rotational glitch , in the x - ray and radio regimes , respectively @xcite .",
    "given this apparent propensity for pulsars with higher - than - average @xmath9-fields to display radiative variability and psr  b1509@xmath058 s relatively large magnetic field of @xmath71 g , future observations of both the radio and x - ray emission properties of psr  b1509@xmath058  may show unusual behavior , particular in the case of a glitch .      the exact relationship between the estimated dipole field strength and the ability and/or frequency of a neutron star to exhibit magnetar activity remains to be established .",
    "however , there is now a wide range of dipole @xmath9 estimates in neutron stars exhibiting magnetar outbursts .",
    "@xcite suggest that all neutron stars may exhibit the type of x - ray outbursts typically associated with magnetars , but that the frequency of events is highly dependent on both the age and the magnetic field strength of the source .",
    "for very young neutron stars ( @xmath22kyr ) , outbursts may be observed roughly yearly for @xmath72 g , but only every 50100yr for @xmath73 g .",
    "thus for neutron stars with @xmath74 g , such as psr  b1509@xmath058  and psr  j1846@xmath00258 , outbursts should be less frequent than once per century .",
    "this implies that the observation of an outburst from psr  j1846@xmath00258  was relatively unlikely given that it has only been observed for @xmath3111yr , and that the lack of magnetic activity from psr  b1509@xmath058  is not surprising .",
    "ongoing observations of many high-@xmath9 radio pulsars should increase the chances of further observations of magnetar - like bursts from rpps .",
    "we presented an extention of the timing solution of psr  b1509@xmath058  from 21.3yr @xcite to 28.4yr .",
    "we found a braking index of @xmath75 , which is 1.6@xmath1 from the value based on 21.3yr of data .",
    "the scatter in short measurements of @xmath24 , and therefore in @xmath17 , is visible in both figures  [ fig : partial ] and [ fig : braking ] , and is typical of timing noise in young pulsars .",
    "we observed that the root - mean - square variation in @xmath17 is @xmath76 , larger than the variations observed in the crab pulsar of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we note that there is evidence for timing noise , but no evidence for a glitch , in contrast to the suggestion made by @xcite that timing noise in pulsars with characteristic ages less than @xmath78yr is entirely because of unmodeled glitch recovery .",
    "however , it remains possible that psr  b1509@xmath058  experiences very small glitches that can not be distinguished from timing noise given the current data .",
    "because no glitches were found in the latest 7.1yr of timing data , this extends the time without a detected glitch for psr  b1509@xmath058  to 28.4yr .",
    "while the youngest pulsars ( @xmath79kyr ) tend to have smaller and fewer glitches than somewhat older pulsars ( @xmath80kyr ) , psr  b1509@xmath058  is extreme in its lack of glitches .",
    "for example , the similarly aged crab pulsar has had 24 glitches in 42 yr of observations , psr b0540@xmath069 has had one glitch in 7.6yr , and psr j1119@xmath06127 has had 3 glitches in 12yr @xcite .",
    "a higher order analog to the braking index ( @xmath81 ) , is the `` second braking index '' , which can be predicted from a measurement of @xmath17 to be @xmath82 and measured with a value of @xmath14 to be @xmath83 .",
    "timing noise and glitches prevent a measurement of @xmath17 for most pulsars .",
    "a measurement of @xmath18 is even more rare ",
    "significant measurements have only been made for the crab pulsar and psr  b1509@xmath058  @xcite . if the standard spin - down model ( @xmath84 ) is an accurate description of the spin down of the pulsar , then @xmath85 . by contrast",
    ", @xmath86 and @xmath87 implies that @xmath88 and a measurement of @xmath18 different from @xmath89 provides constraints on the functional form of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "using the full span of available data of 28.4yr , we found @xmath91s@xmath34 , which is within 1@xmath1 from the previously reported value based on 21.3yr of data .",
    "for the current measurements of @xmath17 and @xmath14 , we find that @xmath92 and @xmath4 , which differ at the 2.3@xmath1 level ( see table  [ table : coherent ] for all rotational parameters ) .",
    "if uncertainties continue to decrease at the same rate as over the last 7.1yr since the previous measurement , and the measured value of @xmath18 remains stable , with another @xmath316yr of timing observations , the uncertainties should be small enough that @xmath18 would differ from @xmath89 at the 3@xmath1 level .",
    "if this proves to be the case and the two values are inconsistent , this would present challenges to the standard model of pulsar spin - down ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "analyzing 14.7yr of _ rxte _  data , we found no evidence of variability in the x - ray emission of psr  b1509@xmath058 .",
    "we have placed limits on possible changes in the pulsed flux , profile variability , and burst rate from psr  b1509@xmath058 .",
    "this indicates that it is indeed possible , as typically assumed , for the x - ray emission properties of rpps to be stable on day to decade long time scales .",
    "several rpps have dipole @xmath9 estimates close to , or larger than , magnetar - strength fields .",
    "these rpps are typically referred to as the high @xmath9-field pulsars .",
    "the link between these and magnetars is not well understood and is under investigation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these pulsars , along with psr  j1846@xmath00258 , are possibly related to the transient magnetars @xcite , such as xte  1810@xmath0197 which experience long periods of quiescence , followed by magnetar activity @xcite .",
    "if the internal @xmath9 field of a neutron star can be much larger than the observed external field responsible for the spin - down ( as suggested for sgr  0418 + 5729 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then it becomes difficult to predict which pulsars may experience a future magnetar - like outburst . indeed",
    ", long - term monitoring observations of psr  j1846@xmath00258  showed that a sudden and dramatic ( though temporary ) change from a pulsar to a magnetar is possible .",
    "thus x - ray monitoring of pulsars such as that performed with _",
