    "we have performed two kinds of nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "the first kind is aimed at calculating the best possible short - range potential by first perturbatively estimating the correlation energy of each molecular configuration excited from the ground state configuration .",
    "if the estimate falls below a threshold this configuration is not included in the configuration interaction procedure .",
    "this truncation of the configurations is necessary because inclusion of all configurations in the configuration interaction procedure is not computationally possible .",
