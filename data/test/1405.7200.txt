    "sonic crystals , defined as periodic distributions of sound scatterers in a fluid or air background , have been proposed as structures for attenuating and filtering sound waves because of their acoustic bandgaps@xcite .",
    "their refractive properties , which were studied in the pioneering work of kock and harvey@xcite back in 1949 , were later revisited and expanded by cervera and coworkers@xcite .",
    "these authors developed an acoustic lens for airborne sound by using a cluster of rigid rods with external lenticular shape .",
    "the lensing behavior was understood to result from the effective properties of the cluster that , at low frequencies , behaves like a homogeneous fluid with some given effective mass density and bulk modulus .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that sonic crystals , with hexagonal and square symmetries , behaves like isotropic fluids whose effective parameters simply depend on the lattice filling fraction@xcite .",
    "research on sonic crystals below the homogenization limit has been boosted in recent years due to the possibility of using them as artificial structures with extreme homogenized properties , referred to as acoustic metamaterials , behaving as broadband anisotropic fluids , or metafluids @xcite . moreover ,",
    "acoustic metamaterials or metafluids with mass anisotropy are receiving increasing attention due to the extraordinary acoustic devices predicted from transformation acoustics , like acoustic cloaks and acoustic hyperlenses , which require anisotropic fluids as the principal ingredient@xcite .",
    "several designs and a few experimental demonstrations of acoustic metamaterials with dynamical mass anisotropy have been reported in the last few years@xcite , which make use of a nonresonant microstructure to create the desired anisotropy .    in most applications ,",
    "acoustic metamaterials have been envisioned using ideal materials , with the presence of losses seen as a hinderance to the design . however , acoustic waves in fluids such as air or water have inherent losses which arise from thermal and viscous effects , and can be particularly pronounced for small structures such as those encountered in metamaterial applications . furthermore ,",
    "for sound absorber applications , these losses can be significant , and are in fact necessary to achieving the goal of absorbing the acoustic energy .",
    "a recent study analyzed the homogenized properties of periodically distributed elastic cylinders embedded in a viscous fluid@xcite , however the analysis was constrained by the condition of low filling fractions , where the sound absorbing effects are not significant unless the frequencies are very high , or the structures are very small .",
    "recently , there has been interest in using the losses within an acoustic metamaterial to provide an enhancement in the absorption , using resonant structures such as membranes and mass - spring - damper systems @xcite .",
    "however , such resonant absorption mechanisms are inherently narrowband , and thus there is a need for nonresonant high loss structures in achieving broadband acoustic metamaterial absorbers .",
    "sonic crystals consisting of rigid rods arranged in a hexagonal lattice with a large filling fraction have been recently employed to dissipate broadband acoustic energy at the core of an omni - directional sound absorber , also known as an _ _ acoustic black hole__@xcite , though the authors did not examine the physical mechanisms of the observed lossy behavior .    in this work",
    ", the use of lossy sonic crystals with high filling fractions will be examined to demonstrate its applicability for sound absorbers , and how acoustic metamaterials with complex - valued effective material properties can be created and implemented , allowing for anisotropy in both the sound absorption characteristics and the effective properties . to accurately understand the behavior of these structures in a realizable experimental configuration ,",
    "confining structures are needed which modify the effective properties , due to the thermal and viscous boundary layer effects within the sonic crystal lattice .",
    "these confined sonic crystal arrangements are found to exhibit an increase in the losses due to the increase in the effective viscosity and a decrease in the bulk modulus due to a change from adiabatic to nearly isothermal conditions within the homogenized sonic crystal .",
    "the behavior of these confined sonic crystal structures is formulated theoretically , and is demonstrated experimentally in an acoustic impedance tube .",
    "although the confining structure experimentally examined is due to the testing apparatus , the theoretical formulation is more general , and demonstrates the use of confined sonic crystals to facilitate the design and realization of soft acoustic metamaterials @xcite , enabling better acoustic absorbers through improved impedance matching and enhanced acoustic and absorption properties .",
    "the work performed here is described as follows . in section  [ sec : theoryanalysissc2d ] , the theoretical formulations and parametric characterization of two - dimensional ( 2d ) sonic crystals with thermovisous losses are presented and verified with numerical simulations .",
    "the properties of these lossy sonic crystals in a complex - valued anisotropic acoustic metafluid are then formulated in section  [ sec : anisoinertia2d ] .",
    "theoretical formulations for confined sonic crystals are developed in section  [ sec : confinedtheorysc ] and the experimental results are described in section  [ sec : experiment ] , followed by a summary of the findings in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for thermoviscous fluids , the properties of the sonic crystal are dependent on the size of the thermal and viscous boundary layers relative to that of the cylinder and lattice dimensions .",
    "in particular , an expression for the effective homogenized properties is sought for a lattice of cylinders which are non - interacting , both fluid dynamically ( i.e. boundary layers which do not touch ) and acoustically ( neglecting multiple scattering effects ) .",
    "extensive work has been performed on the topic of porous media , and detailed models have been developed to describe such systems .",
    "the specific formulations in each case depend on the configuration of the microstructure .",
    "two - dimensional sonic crystals , which consist of parallel cylinders in a structured lattice , represent an idealized arrangement of a fibrous porous media , and previous work on such fibrous porous materials can provide a basis for development of a model for lossy sonic crystals . a theoretical formulation for 2d lossy sonic crystals is presented in section  [ sec : theorysc2d ] , from which a nondimensional parameter space is developed and discussed in section  [ sec : paramspace2d ] .",

    "effrhosheath])([eq : effbulkmodsheathlip ] ) it can be observed that the sheath and the sheath lip will increase the measured effective density . for the bulk modulus ,",
    "the sheath itself will lead to an increase due to the increase in the specific acoustic impedance , though the presence of the sheath lip acts to reduce the effective bulk modulus .",
    "although which factor dominates depends on the precise thicknesses of the sheath and sheath lip , it is clear from equation  ( [ eq : effbulkmodsheathlip ] ) that the observable effective bulk modulus resulting from the sheath lip will depend on the relative magnitude of the effective bulk modulus of the sonic crystal compared with that of the ambient air .",
    "thus , the presence of the sheath lip will be amplified as the filling fraction increase , and therefore one would expect this effect to dominate at higher filling fractions , where @xmath85 .",
    "to verify the theoretical model for confined sonic crystals , several samples were fabricated and experimentally tested using a standard circular cross - section acoustic impedance tube .",
    "the inner diameter of the impedance tube is 3.5 cm , and the end of the tube is terminated with fiber glass insulation to provide an anechoic termination .",
    "noise is generated and transmitted using a electromechanical driver , and measured using 0.50 inch ( 1.27 cm ) diameter g.r.a.s .",
    "condenser microphones .",
    "the microphones are arranged in a standard 4-microphone configuration@xcite , allowing for the magnitude and phase of both the reflection and transmission pressure coefficients to be directly determined using a transfer - matrix method @xcite , from which the complex impedance and wavenumber were obtained for the range 3002000 hz .",
    "these values correspond to the same effective properties described for the theoretical model given by equations  ( [ eq : zeff ] ) and ( [ eq : kleff ] ) .      the sonic crystal samples were created using a commercial 3d printer out of abs plastic for several different configurations , which are listed in table  [ tab : sampleabc ] and cover a wide range of filling fractions .",
    "the three sonic crystal samples described in table  [ tab : sampleabc ] , consisting of a single uniform arrangement with constant lattice parameter , were constructed to verify the results of the modeling of the confined sonic crystals , based on the formulations presented in section  [ sec : confinedtheorysc ] . a photograph of a sample mounted in the impedance tube is shown in fig .  [ fig : imptubesc ] .",
    "in this figure , the thin plastic sheath surrounding the sonic crystal of the test sample can be seen , which was necessary for structural support to ensure the cylinders remained properly aligned .",

    "[ fig : modelcomp2d ] ) , and second including the modifications for the confined sonic crystal with the effective thermal properties and isothermal boundary conditions for the dynamic compressibility described by equations  ( [ eq : c_highff ] ) , ( [ eq : effvisccyl ] ) , and ( [ eq : h_bar ] ) . for the real and imaginary parts of the density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scdata3d](a ) and ( b ) , there is excellent agree between both models and the experimental results , with only a slight deviation observed with the unconfined 2d sonic crystal model at the highest filling fraction ( sample a ) . for the complex sound speed and bulk modulus shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scdata3d](c)(f ) , there is a much more significant difference between the modeled results , resulting from the different thermal boundary conditions used to derive the expressions for the dynamic compressibility , and thus the bulk modulus . in particular , it is observed that the 2d sonic crystal model , which was in excellent agreement with the 2d results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelcomp2d ] , yields a bulk modulus which has a significantly higher real part , with a correspondingly lower imaginary part , than the experimental data .",
    "this trend is also observed in the sound speed data as well .",
    "however , the theoretical formulation with the modifications for the confined sonic crystal correctly accounts for this decrease in the bulk modulus and increase in the losses ( characterized by the imaginary part of the properties ) , and is in excellent agreement with the experimental results for the entire range of filling fractions examined .",
    "mm , for the anisotropic acoustic metamaterial configuration illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisolatticegeom ] . ]      for the realization of the acoustic metamaterial with complex anisotropic inertia , two samples were constructed using the arrangement illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisolatticegeom](a ) and ( b ) to demonstrate the anisotropy in the normal and perpendicular directions , respectively . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisolatticegeom ] , these samples consist of two sets of alternating sonic crystal layers , containing a high filling fraction layer ( dark ) and low filling fraction ( light ) . the same experimental setup was used to test these acoustic metamaterial samples , the results for which are presented in fig .",

    "for comparison , theoretical results using equations  ( [ eq : zeff ] ) and ( [ eq : kleff ] ) to calculate the effective properties of the structure , with the homogenized layer properties based on those for confined sonic crystals ( corresponding to the theoretical results presented for sample a and c in fig .  [ fig : scdata3d ] ) . upon examination of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisoinertiadata3d ] , excellent agreement is observed between the theoretical and experimental results .",
    "this corresponds to an accurate description of both the real and imaginary parts of each effective property , for each orientation .",
    "the anisotropic inertia for this acoustic metamaterial is observed in the data through the significantly different values in the real and imaginary parts of the effective density for the normal and perpendicular orientations .",
    "these trends are precisely captured by the theoretical results , for the complex values of the density , sound speed and bulk modulus .",
    "in this work , we present theoretical and experimental results for the consideration of thermal and viscous losses on the performance of sonic crystals , with filling fractions much larger than traditional porous absorbers . due to the ordered microstructure",
    ", expressions for the complex effective parameters of sonic crystals can be written with no unknown or empirical coefficients .",
    "in addition , it is shown that they can be completely characterized by only the filling fraction and normalized boundary layer thickness . from these results ,",
    "parametric plots are developed and examined , and highlight desirable characteristics for the enhancement of sound absorption , including loss factors near unity and low bulk moduli .",
    "the effects of a confining structure around a sonic crystal lattice is examined theoretically and experimentally , with the results showing excellent agreement over a wide range of filling fractions and frequencies .",
    "a formulation for acoustic metamaterials with complex - valued effective material properties is presented , making use of these confined sonic crystal properties , which is also in excellent agreement with the theoretical model .",
    "although only a relatively simple configuration was examined , the anisotropic acoustic metamaterial and confined sonic crystal formulations discussed and developed here have the potential for more complicated designs , enabling the construction of effective fluid sound absorbers that have anisotropy in both the material properties and absorption characteristics , as well as the potential for creating soft acoustic metamaterials with enhanced sound absorption performance .",
