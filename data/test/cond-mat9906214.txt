    "since the discovery of bose - einstein condensation in magnetically trapped bose gases , the study of the low - energy collective excitations has attracted a big interest both from experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "mean field theory has proven to be a good framework to study static , dynamic and thermodynamic properties of these trapped gases . in particular , it provides predictions of the frequencies of collective excitations that very well agree with the observed ones .",
    "recently @xcite the energy shifts and damping rates of these low - lying collective excitations have been measured as a function of temperature . however",
    ", these phenomena have not yet been completely understood theoretically .    in this paper",
    "we study the influence of thermal excitations on collective oscillations of the condensate in the collisionless regime .",
    "previous papers on this subject has been devoted mainly to calculation of the landau damping by means of perturbation theory . in refs.@xcite",
    "only the uniform system has been considered , whereas in refs.@xcite landau damping in trapped bose gases has also been studied but using the semiclassical approximation for thermal excitations and the hydrodynamic approximation for collective oscillations .",
    "an important point of refs.@xcite is that the authors discuss the possible chaotic behavior of the excitations in an anisotropic trap .",
    "the frequency shift has also been studied for a trapped condensate in the collisionless regime in ref.@xcite .    in the present work we study the interaction between collective and thermal excitations using the gross - pitaevskii equation and perturbation theory .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric traps , since in this case the spectrum of excitations is easily calculated , avoiding the use of further approximations .",
    "even though the case of anisotropic traps can be significantly different in the final results , a detailed investigation of spherical traps is instructive .",
    "we explore , in particular , the properties of monopole oscillations by studying the temperature - induced resonances that occur in the condensate when an external perturbation of the trapping frequency is applied and , also , the landau damping associated with the interaction with thermally excited states .",

    "iv we introduce the linear response function formalism and calculate the response function of the condensate when a small perturbation of the trapping frequency is applied .",
    "we derive analytic equations for the response function at zero temperature and treat perturbatively the contribution of the elementary excitations , which is related to landau damping . in sec .",

    "the choice here of a spherical trap has two different reasons .",
    "first , it greatly reduces the numerical effort and will allow us to study the interaction of oscillations with elementary excitations without any further approximations .",
    "second , the energy spectrum of the excitations in such a trap is well resolved yielding to the appearance of well - separated resonances . in anisotropic traps , conversely , the spectrum of excitations is much denser",

    "the main reason for these `` strong transitions '' is that the temperature occupation factor for these low - lying levels is large .",

    "the relative strenght of the response function ( @xmath216 ) at @xmath208 depends not only on the damping coefficient @xmath209 but also on @xmath217 .",
    "it means that one mode @xmath208 will be easier to excite , i.e. , the strength of the response will be bigger , when it is close to the frequency of the monopole .",
    "note also that the resonance strength increases with temperature through @xmath209 .    from table 1 one can see that the biggest resonance occurs at @xmath218 which is resoluble from the monopole frequency @xmath219 and has a large enough relative strength to be observed .",
    "it means that , tuning the perturbation frequency @xmath91 to this value , a fluctuation of the fractional amplitude of oscillations can be observed .    in figure 3",
    "we have plotted the frequency dependence of the real part of response function @xmath220 calculated according to equation ( [ alpha-1b ] ) for @xmath206 .",
    "the response function is given in arbitrary units , and frequency is in units of @xmath196 .",
    "the dashed line shows the monopole resonance at @xmath153 , whereas the other divergences of @xmath83 correspond to the temperature - induced resonances at @xmath208 . from this figure",
    "one can see that the thermal induced resonances are quite distinct one from the other and from the monopole one .",
    "therefore , temperature - induced resonances could be observed in experiments with good enough frequency resolution and good accuracy in the measurement of the radius fluctuations .",
    "we would like to stress that the phenomenon we have discussed is related to quite delicate features of interaction between elementary excitations , and therefore , its observation would give rich information about properties of bose - einstein condensed gases at finite temperature .      from fig .",
    "1 one can see that the weak background transitions @xmath154 have , generally speaking , very small frequency separation . to estimate this distance quantitatively",
    "let us renominate the resonances by an index @xmath42 in the order of increasing value of @xmath91 .",
    "then , one can define the average distance between resonances @xmath221 according to : @xmath222 in a small interval around the collective oscillation @xmath223 , we sum up all the transition frequencies allowed by the monopole selection rules and find the following values for the average distance between two consecutive transition frequencies : @xmath224 and @xmath225 for @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath226 , respectively .",
    "it is hopeless , of course , to try to resolve these resonances . actually , there are reasons to believe that these resonances are smoothed and overlapped .",
    "first of all , because a real trap can not be exactly isotropic .",
    "it means that levels with different @xmath179 have slightly different energies , only levels with @xmath227 are exactly degenerated .",
    "therefore , each energy level with a given @xmath178 will be splitted on @xmath228 closer sublevels making more dense the energy spectrum .",
    "furthermore , all excitations at finite temperature have associated a finite life time .",
    "excitations with @xmath229 which are the ones that mainly contribute in the `` background '' transitions , have the shortest life time .",
    "this can be accounted for phenomenologically by assuming that these levels have a finite lorentzian width @xmath230 .",
    "that is , instead of delta functions in the equation for the damping rate ( [ damping2 ] ) , we will consider a lorentzian distribution centered at @xmath154 with a fixed width @xmath231 : @xmath232 $ ] . in this case",
    "the damping rate becomes a smooth function of @xmath233 and its value when @xmath234 defines the landau damping of the monopole oscillations . at conditions @xmath235",
    "the damping rate will have only a weak dependence on the exact value of @xmath230 . in figure 4",
    "we plot the the dimensionless damping rate @xmath236 as a function of the lorentzian width @xmath230 ( in units of @xmath196 ) for @xmath237 at different temperatures .",
    "the summation in ( [ damping2 ] ) has been done over all resonances excluding of course the  strong resonances \" presented in figures 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath230-dependence is weak indeed in the interval @xmath238 and @xmath239 can be reliable extrapolated from this interval to the value @xmath240 .",
    "we take as landau damping this extrapolated value of @xmath239 .",
    "one can estimate the accuracy of this extrapolation procedure to be of the order of 10 % according to the change of @xmath239 over this interval . in figure 5",
    "we plot the damping rate versus @xmath241 for @xmath206 and @xmath207 atoms in the condensate .",
    "as expected , landau damping increases with temperature since the number of excitations available at thermal equilibrium is larger when @xmath104 increases .",
    "one can distinguish two different regimes in fig .",
    "5 one at very low @xmath104 ( @xmath242 ) and the other at higher @xmath104 .",
    "the behaviour of the damping rate becomes linear at relatively small temperature ( @xmath243 ) in comparison to the homogeneous system @xcite where this regime occurs at @xmath244 .",
    "moreover , the damping rate increases for larger number of condensed atoms because the density of states available to the system also increases . it is interesting to note that the order of magnitude of the damping rate is the same as the one previously estimated for an uniform gas @xcite and for anisotropic traps @xcite .",
    "we have considered the monopole oscillation of a bose - condensed dilute atomic gas in an isotropic trap .",
    "first of all , we have calculated the normal modes of the condensate by solving the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation within bogoliubov theory @xcite and then we have used the formalism developed in ref.@xcite to calculate the matrix elements associated with the transitions between excited states allowed by the monopole selection rules . within a first order perturbation theory",
    "we have studied the landau damping of collective modes due to the coupling with thermal excited levels .",
    "we have developed the response function formalism to study the fluctuations of the system due to an external perturbation .",
    "the contribution of the elementary excitations has been introduced also perturbatively as in the calculation of the damping strength , and we have derived analytic equations for the response function at zero temperature and at low temperature regime .",
    "we have seen that when the condensate oscillates with the monopole mode and a small perturbation to the trap frequency is applied , one can excite new resonances at the transition frequencies .",
    "these thermal - induced resonances are coupled with the monopole due to interaction effects .",
    "one can not exclude _ a priori _ the possibility to observe such resonances also in anisotropic traps .",
    "this problem deserves further investigation .",
    "observation of these resonances would give important and unique information about the interaction between elementary excitations in bose - einstein condensed gases .",
