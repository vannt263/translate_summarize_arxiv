    "supersymmetry is the most popular framework for addressing the stability of the electroweak scale . especially after the discovery of a higgs boson on july 4th , 2012 , the precise mechanism for , or the lack thereof , stabilizing the mass of the higgs boson has become one of the most outstanding theoretical issues .",
    "so far experimental searches for any new particles beyond the standard model have returned null results .",
    "direct search limits for various colored supersymmetric particles such as the gluino and the first two generation scalar quarks , or squarks , have reached the tev regime at the end of the 7/8 tev run at the lhc .",
    "the only exception is the third generation squarks , which tend to decay to third generation quarks such as the tops and the bottoms and , as a result , have much weaker direct search limits in the vicinity of 500 gev .",
    "third generation squarks , in particular the stops , play a special role in cancelling the quadratic divergences in the higgs mass from the top quark .",
    "absence of fine - tuning in the higgs mass requires the stops to be below 1 tev and , as such , the lhc will be able to either discover the stops or put strong constraints on so - called `` natural supersymmetry , '' where stops are below 1 tev , by the end of the 14 tev run .",
    "in other words , experimental searches for light stops have become the litmus test for naturalness in supersymmetry .    at the lhc stops",

    ". moreover , atlas and cms made different choices of polarizations which would lead to different acceptance rates of the possible signals @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , current searches did not optimize between the top and the chargino channels by utilizing the different decay kinematics , using instead the same selection cuts for both .    although the possibility of polarized tops in stop decays has long been studied in the literature @xcite , the corresponding issue of chargino polarization seems to have received little attention @xcite . in this brief note",
    "we compute the energy and angular spectra of the charged lepton in the chargino decay channel of the stop .",
    "much like the charged lepton in the top decays could be used as the spin - analyzer of the top spin @xcite , the charged lepton in the chargino channel could serve as the spin - analyzer of the chargino .",
    "in addition to calculating the lepton spectra , we also study the impact of polarizations on several laboratory frame observables , including those employed in selecting signal events in current searches .",
    "furthermore , two simple observables , the opening angle between the charged lepton and the @xmath3 quark and the energy of the @xmath3 quark , are proposed to allow for possible separation of the chargino channel from the top channel in stop decays .",

    "we also performed parton - level monte carlo simulations to study impacts of polarizations on kinematic variables in the laboratory frame at the lhc .",
    "we found that the selection efficiencies in the top channel could be affected significantly by the polarization , while the corresponding effect in the chargino channel is less significant .",
    "in addition , we proposed two variables in the laboratory frame , @xmath95 and @xmath92 , to optimize the searches in the chargino versus the top channels .",
    "our results suggest simulations including full detect effects and relevant backgrounds are warranted and should be undertaken .",
