    "the period of enlightenment was a time when spanish physics , which had been lagging behind the level of the rest of europe , was able to recover . however , the political events of the end of the 18th - century , the war of independence , and then the reign of fernando vii ruined the panorama of spanish science .",
    "history was sadly to repeat itself with the spanish civil war of 1936 , which brought to nothing the efforts of physicists and mathematicians of the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries to regain the time lost during the reign of fernando vii until the `` generation of 98 '' .",
    "part of the disastrous situation during the 19th - century can be traced back to the legislation and curricular plans of spain s universities .",
    "the faculty of exact , physical , and natural sciences was not created until 1857 , with the ley ( law ) moyano .",
    "physics had been relegated to a minor faculty , that of arts , as preparation for the major faculties , and formed part of the `` philosophical institutions '' which were studied in the following order : i. history of philosophy and elements of mathematics ; ii .",
    "logic and metaphysics ; iii .",
    "general physics ; iv . special physics .",
    "all was in a latin which had become progressively less suited to teaching , so that enlightened reformers always attempted to publish textbooks in spanish .",
    "physics texts in latin were still being imposed on students even up to the time of the absolutist period of fernando vii @xcite .",
    "after the death of fernando vii , an ordinance regulating printing was promulgated in 1834 which allowed a certain freedom in publication , in particular in scientific publishing .",
    "one of the consequences of the centralization of curricular plans , such as the plan pidal , was the impulse given to the production of textbooks associated with the new programs of study .",
    "they were original productions as well as translations of foreign authors , and formed the beginning of a national scientific output which was to be of greater or lesser quality according to each particular case .",
    "the study plans usually counselled the use of certain textbooks which most closely approached the spirit of the courses .",
    "the procedure consisted in appointing committees to decide on the most suitable texts which then put forward a number of them to be chosen from .    in the meantime",
    ", europe was seeing a major change in vision towards atomism thanks to such personalities as herapath , waterston , clausius , van der waals , maxwell , and boltzmann @xcite .",
    "imponderable fluids had been abandoned as the explanation of physical phenomena , and mechanics , heat , electromagnetism , and optics had been unified by the concept of energy .",
    "teaching was based on a program of mechanical explanations @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present communication is to analyze the impact of modern ideas concerning energy and the constitution of matter on the textbooks of 19th - century spain .",
    "we have examined 45 works on general physics at secondary and university education levels , with publication dates from the mid 19th - century to the early 20th - century .",
    "one of the first things that struck us was the great similarity between the books of different authors . with centralism",
    ", teachers were encouraged to write their own textbooks and , indeed , were rewarded for doing so . at the same time , the administration s goal was for teaching to be uniform nationwide .",
    "the result was that textbooks were written essentially with the ministerio de fomento s ( ministry of development ) official program as the table of contents , and that the texts served solely to expound known science and in no way to serve as the basis for further research .",
    "there were those who , being interested in science teaching , protested about the policy concerning textbooks .",
    "representative of them was eduardo lozano y ponce de len . under the pseudonym l. opando y uceda , lozano published `` programas y libros de texto '' ( programs and textbooks ) in _ revista de la sociedad de profesores de ciencias _",
    "@xcite , and under the pseudonym `` un extremeo '' the same article in the journal _ el magisterio extremeo _ ( _ the extremean schoolmaster _ ) @xcite . in this same journal and on the same theme ,",
    "ildefonso fernndez snchez published another critical article @xcite . in his writings",
    "lozano asked for the programs to have reference strictly to the subject matter to be dealt with and not to the methods to be used , and that the programs should include suggestions of the books that were best suited to the subject , but without the obligation of following them .",
    "the immediate consequence of that educational policy was that the different editions of textbooks seemed rather to be reprintings : textbook `` immutability '' from one edition to another was astonishing .",
    "let us take two cases as example .",
    "the _ trait lmentaire de physique _ ( _ elementary treatise on physics _ ) by a. ganot was used in many spanish and european institutes ( secondary education ) and universities . the first spanish language edition dates from 1853 . the 18th spanish edition was printed in 1923 , and",
    "even as late as 1945 an edition was published in san sebastin @xcite . in all this time",
    "there were only small modifications made with respect to the first french edition .",
    "an even more extreme example , since it was a work with even more antiquated ways of putting the material than ganot , was the textbook of @xcite . the 2nd edition dates from 1851 @xcite and the 10th edition from 1870 @xcite . in these twenty years and eight new editions the work remained without a single significant change , notwithstanding the archaic ways of setting forth the subject matter of the first editions .",
    "a third example is less disappointing : _ elementos de fsica _ ( _ elements of physics _ ) by enrique iglesias ejarque .",
    "the first edition of 1897 @xcite has quite a modern manner of exposition .",
    "nevertheless , while the following editions introduce small amounts of additional material into the text , there are never any significant changes .",
    "the 8th edition dates from 1924 @xcite and the last that we can find a reference to is the 10th edition in 1933 .",
    "clearly one may conclude that physics textbooks had quite a long effective lifetime .",
    "while there was a certain degree of difficulty in introducing new material into the textbooks , the great problem was to eliminate content which was included by tradition even though it was antiquated .",
    "the case of eduardo snchez pardo , the translator of ganot s work , is significant . in the prologue to that",
    "popularly used book :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the editor d. crlos bailly - baillire being for his part desirous that our public in general , and the pupils of our institutes and faculties in particular , follow science in her latest advances , charged us with the translation of the latest edition of the cited treatise on physics . on taking on this commitment , with the object that the spanish edition be more complete , we judged it convenient , corresponding thereby also to the wishes of the editor , to conserve certain theories , the exposition of various experiments , and the description of some of the instruments or apparatus that had figured in earlier editions of the forementioned work , and that in the latest edition had been totally or partially suppressed .",

    "works that are halfway between textbook and simple program of the curriculum abound .",

    "as clear examples we could cite , amongst several works , the _ resumen de fsica y nociones de qumica _ ( _ a summary of physics and notions of chemistry _ ) @xcite , and _ definiciones , principios y leyes de la fsica _ ( _ definitions , principles , and laws of physics _ ) @xcite . hence , for most students learning was not meaningful but purely memorization .",
    "together with the lack of practical classes , this may have been one of the causes of spanish physics slow rate of development during the 19th - century .",
    "in order to analyze what we understand to have been the introduction of modern physics into spanish textbooks , we asked ourselves the following questions relative to the works that we consulted :    1 .",
    "[ q1]are imponderable fluids studied in the textbook ? 2 .",
    "[ q2 ] is the term caloric used to refer to heat ?",
    "3 .   [ q3]does the concept of energy appear in a general form ?",
    "[ q4]does the mechanical theory of heat appear ?",
    "[ q5]does the kinetic theory of gases appear ?",
    "affirmative responses to the first two questions would indicate traditionalism , and to the last three , modernity .",
    "we would classify a textbook as modern if questions [ q3 ] and [ q4 ] are answered affirmatively .",
    "if the kinetic theory of gases appears as well ( question 5 ) , then we would consider the textbook to be quite complete",
    ". table [ tablei ] lists the responses to these questions for the 19th - century textbooks to which we had access .",
    "the works are ordered by publication date . when the edition is not given , reference is to the first edition .",
    "most of the works consulted belong to the library of the real sociedad econmica de amigos del pas in badajoz ( spain ) . while not exhaustive , the sample is significant , since students of the city of badajoz in the 19th - century were prepared in this centre for the entrance examinations of the schools of engineering ( high - level technical degree courses , rather than purely engineering in the english language sense ) or military academies .    .",
    "responses to the five questions posed in the text , according to the different works consulted . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some comments are necessary concerning table [ tablei ] .",
    "the books that were published in spain in the 1840s studied imponderable fluids , and dealt neither with energy , nor with the mechanical theory of heat , nor with the kinetic theory of gases .",
    "this situation was natural since these concepts were only being developed in europe at this time .",
    "however some foreign authors already did not study imponderable fluids ( neither did they use the term caloric to refer to heat ) , and their spanish translations set an example for such fluids to be abandoned .",
    "this was the case with the textbook of deguin , translated by venancio gonzlez @xcite . the translator would write his own textbook later @xcite , and despite going through numerous editions , would never abandon imponderable fluids .",
    "another textbook of a french author is @xcite , translated by florencio martn castro , although here imponderable fluids were still being studied in the original .",
    "the handbook of @xcite presents physics as a science of nature in general , including subjects such as geology and geography .",
    "this was the concept of physics that existed in europe at the beginning of the century . on the positive side , the mechanical ideal which was at the base of the development of physics in the 19th - century did indeed",
    "have a reflection in spanish textbooks .",

    "although it studied imponderable fluids , the term caloric was not used , and neither energy , nor the mechanical theory of heat , nor the kinetics of gases appear in the text .",
    "the other textbook that we consulted is that of @xcite .",
    "although imponderable fluids are studied and the term caloric is used , the author briefly explains the theory of ondulations ( as the mechanical theory of heat was first known ) , and says of that theory that `` it is the one which today seems more correct '' ( p. 173 ) .",

    "the textbooks of spanish authors of the 1860s were still studying imponderable fluids .",
    "they were also still using the term caloric to refer to heat , except for the editions of @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) , as we noted before .",
    "one french - authored textbook , @xcite , did not study imponderable fluids or use the term caloric , but then neither did it use the energy concept or the theories we are looking for . the same was the case with the textbook of @xcite , commented on above .",
    "a possible reason for these to be missing is that the translator , ramn de la sagra , used the 7th french edition .",
    "the note of modernity is found in the textbook of @xcite , in which there appears an idea concerning the mechanical theory of heat , namely the hypothesis of ondulations , although for didactic purposes the theory of emissions ( caloric ) was preferred .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the evolution of the responses to the questions that we formulated , according to the data listed in table [ tablei ] .",
    "spain s educational policies in the 19th - century encouraged a great similarity between the general physics textbooks of different authors , although there were voices such as that of eduardo lozano y ponce de len , in discord with this policy .",
    "this situation led to the differences between the successive editions of a textbook being minimal , and as a result , the effective lifetime of these textbooks was extremely long .",
    "a noteworthy example is the spanish translation of the work of a. ganot  the 1st edition was published in 1853 and the last we know of was 1945 .",
    "likewise , there were difficulties in rooting out the antiquated content of physics textbooks .",
    "in many of them , modern and old theories shared the pages .",
    "a significant example was the case of eduardo snchez pardo , who amplified his translation @xcite with elements of old editions that had been discarded from consideration in new foreign editions .",
    "the result was to help make the recovery of spanish physics was a very slow process .    with respect to the term caloric , it was used in the spain of this period with different acceptations : as an imponderable fluid responsible for thermal phenomena ( its original meaning ) , as a synonym for heat ( the latter being understood according to the mechanical theory of heat ) , and as the cause of the phenomena of heat , whatever their nature .    also , during the analysis of the sources that were available , we found the orientation towards examination preparation to be excessive in the textbooks that we consulted .",
    "some are a simple cookbook of laws and physical phenomena that the students would have to learn if they were to pass their examination .",
    "hence , no interest was aroused in reflecting on content or in carrying out experiments in practical classes .",
    "certain textbooks shamelessly encouraged totally memoristic learning , so that content was not applied to new situations and was readily forgotten .",
    "another fact revealed by the analysis of the textbooks was the speed with which the mechanical theory of heat gained acceptance .",
    "this theory had become quite usual in many of the spanish physics textbooks well before the concept of energy had begun to be treated in a general form . while this fact seems disconcerting from today s viewpoint , it must be pointed out that both the mechanical theory of heat and the second law of thermodynamics had been proposed before the law of conservation of energy was generally accepted .",
    "the introduction of the kinetic theory into 19th - century spain occurred from approximately the 1870s onwards . in the 1880s",
    ", the theory already appears more developed in one of the textbooks that we consulted .",
    "this was the work of @xcite , which stands out for its mechanistic deductions of mariotte s law and avogadro s law .",
    "the topics dealt with concerning the kinetic theory in the textbooks that we consulted were : generalities of the theory , kinetic interpretation of pressure , molecular velocities , mean free path , height of the atmosphere , and the van der waals equation .",
    "lastly it should be remarked that we found no original contribution to kinetic theory in these spanish works of the end of the 19th - century .",
