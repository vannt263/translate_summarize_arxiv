    "quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in multicomponent systems has attracted a lot of attention since the seminal work by halperin @xcite .",
    "these components could be the spins of electrons when the zeeman coupling is very small or layer indices in multi - layered system .",
    "in particular , spin - polarized bilayer quantum hall ( blqh ) systems at total filling factor @xmath5 have been under enormous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations over the last decade .",
    "when the interlayer separation @xmath6 is sufficiently large , the bilayer system decouples into two separate compressible @xmath7 layers . however , when @xmath6 is sufficiently small , in the absence of interlayer tunneling , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition into a novel spontaneous interlayer coherent incompressible phase @xcite .    by treating the two layer indices as two pseudo - spin indices , girvin , macdonald and collaborators @xcite mapped the bilayer system into a easy plane quantum ferromagnet ( epqfm ) .",
    "they achieved the mapping by projecting the hamiltonian of the blqh onto the lowest landau level ( lll ) and then using subsequent hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation and gradient expansion ( called lll+hf in the following ) .",
    "they explored many rich and interesting physical phenomena in this system .",
    "the low energy excitations above the ground state is given by an effective @xmath8 dimensional @xmath9 model .",
    "in addition to the goldstone mode , there are also 4 flavors of topological defects called `` merons '' which carry fractional charges @xmath10 and also have @xmath11 vorticity .",
    "they have logarithmic divergent self energies and are bound into pairs at low temperature .",
    "the lowest energy excitations carry charge @xmath12 which are a meron pair with opposite vorticity and the same charge .",
    "there is a finite temperature kosterlize - thouless ( kt ) phase transition at @xmath13 where bound states of the 4 flavors of merons are broken into free merons .",
    "unfortunately , this transition has not been observed so far .",
    "the epqfm approach is a microscopic one which takes care of lll projection from the very beginning .",
    "however , the charge sector was explicitly projected out , the connection and coupling between the charge sector which displays fractional quantum hall effect and the spin sector which displays interlayer phase coherence was not obvious in the epqfm approach .    in @xcite , i used and extended both mutual composite fermion ( mcf ) and composite boson ( cb ) approaches to study both balanced and imbalanced blqh and made critical comparisons between the two approaches .",
    "i identified several serious problems with the mcf approach and then developed a simple cb approach which naturally avoids all these problems suffered in the mcf approach .",
    "i found the cb approach is superior to mcf approach in the blqh with broken symmetry .",
    "the functional form of the spin sector of the cb theory is the same as the epqfm .",
    "it also has the advantage to treat charged excitations and the collective order parameter fluctuations in the pseudo - spin sector on the same footing , therefore can spell out the spin - charge connections explicitly . from this spin - charge connection",
    ", we are able to classify all the possible excitations in the blqh in a systematic way .",
    "the cb theory may also be applied to study the incoherent disordered insulating side and the quantum phase transitions between different ground states @xcite . using the cb approach",
    ", i also studied several interesting phenomena specific to im - balanced blqh .",
    "just like any chern - simon theory , the cb theory in blqh has its own limitations : it is hard to incorporate the lll projection ( see however @xcite ) , some parameters can only be taken as phenomilogical parameters to be fitted into the microscopic lll+hf calculations or experimental data .",
    "it is an effective low energy theory , so special care is needed to capture some physics at microscopic length scales    in this paper , we use both mcf approach and the cb approach developed in @xcite to study spin polarized trilayer quantum hall ( tlqh ) systems at total filling factor @xmath14 .",
    "we also supplement the two approaches by wavefunction approach .",
    "tlqh is interesting from both experimental and theoretical sides . on the experimental side ,",
    "tlqh systems have been fabricated in high mobility electron systems in the experimental group led by shayegan @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , because the three layers play the roles of three flavors .",
    "the excitons in blqh is the pairing of particle in one layer and the hole in the other .",
    "this pairing structure in blqh is similar to the cooper pairing in bcs superconductors up to a particle - hole transformation . while the excitons in tlqh is not obvious , because so far there is no analog of three flavors superconductors yet",
    ". it would be interesting to understand the structures of the excitons and all the possible excitations in tlqh . as shown in this paper , due to the particular structure pattern of the excitons , there are two _ coupled",
    "_ goldstone modes in the tlqh ( see eqn.[tun3 ] ) . in the presence of interlayer tunnelings ( with or without in - plane magnetic field ) ,",
    "the interference between the two gapless modes may also lead to many new phenomena which can not be seen in blqh .",
    "there are at least two well defined regimes for tlqh .",
    "( i ) interlayer coherent regime : when the distance @xmath6 bewteen the two adjcent layers is sufficiently small , then all the three layers are strongly correlated .",
    "( ii ) weakly - coupled regime : when @xmath6 is sufficiently large , then all the three layers are are weakly coupled .",
    "depending on the distance @xmath6 , there could be many other possible regimes .",
    "in this paper , we focus on regime ( i ) which is the interlayer coherent regime .",
    "the system in the interlayer coherent regime ( i ) was discussed in @xcite in lll+ hf approach , two goldstone modes are found . here , we study the regime ( i ) in detail from both mcf and cb approaches and also stress the broken symmetry state in terms of @xmath4 algebra .",
    "consider a tri - layer system with @xmath15 electrons in layer 1 ( the bottom layer ) , layer 2 ( the middle layer ) and layer 3 ( the top layer ) respectively in the presence of magnetic field @xmath16 .",
    "we assume equal interlayer distance @xmath6 between adjacent layers , the total filling factor is @xmath5 and the spin is completely polarized .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath17 is @xmath18 where electrons have bare mass @xmath19 and carry charge @xmath20 ; @xmath21 are electron operators and normal ordered electron densities on the three layers .",
    "the intralayer interactions are @xmath22 , while interlayer interaction is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dielectric constant .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss mcf approach to tlqh and point out its weakness . in section iii , we discuss cb approach and derive an effective action involving the charge and the two goldstone modes .",
    "we also derive a dual action of the cb approach and make critical comparisons between this dual action and the mcf action .",
    "we classify all the possible excitations and discuss possible 2-body and 3-body bound states and associated kosterlize - thouless transitions . in section iv , we will outline several salient features of correlated interlayer tunnelings with or without in - plane magnetic field in tlqh .",
    "we reach conclusions in the final section . at appropriate places in the paper , we point out the limitations of the cb approach .",

    "mcf in each layer feel effective magnetic field @xmath45 , therefore fill exactly one mcf landau level .",
    "the energy gaps are simply the cyclotron gaps of the mcf landau levels @xmath46 .",
    "adding three different source gauge potentials @xmath47 to the three layers in eqn.[original ] , integrating out the mcf @xmath48 first , then the mutual cs gauge fields , we can calculate the resistivity tensor by kubo formula .",
    "we find that both hall resistivity and two hall drag resistivities are @xmath1 .",
    "this means if one drives current in one layer , the hall resistivities in all the three layers are quantized at @xmath1 , while the longitudinal resistivities in all the three layers vanish .",
    "this is the hallmark of interlayer coherent quantum hall states .    in the following ,",
    "we confine to balanced case @xmath49 , imbalanced case can be discussed along the similar line developed in @xcite .",
    "let s look at the charge of quasi - particles created by mcf field operators @xmath50 .",
    "if we insert one electron at one of the layers , say layer 1 , from the singular gauge transformation in eqn.[sing ] , we can see this is equivalent to insert one mcf in layer 1 , at the same time , insert one flux quantum at layer 2 and another one at layer 3 directly above the position where we inserted the electron .",
    "the inserted flux quantum at layer 2 and layer 3 are in the opposite direction to the external magnetic field , therefore promote one mcf in layer 2 and one in layer 3 to the second mcf landau level in layer 2 and layer 3 respectively . because inserting one electron leads to three mcfs in each layer",
    ", we conclude the charge of each mcf is -1/3 .",
