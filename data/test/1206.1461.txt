    "simple broadband microwave interconnects are key components for arrays of focal plane heterodyne radiometers . here",
    "we report on an investigation of transmission line arrays printed on flexible circuit board substrates , part of a program to develop and assess components for a scalable millimeter - wave focal plane radiometer@xcite . for tens of focal plane elements ,",
    "microwave intermediate frequency signals can be routed on individual semi - rigid coaxial cables , but this approach becomes cumbersome for large focal plane arrays .",
    "here we report on an alternative interconnect : microstripline on a polyimide ( kapton@xcite ) flex circuit substrate . a number of papers@xcite , among others , report microwave characterization of flex substrates , but none that we are aware of report cryogenic properties .    of the well - developed planar transmission line structures , we choose microstripline because of its mechanical simplicity , its relatively low electrical loss , and because it requires the least metal of common planar transmission lines .",
    "the last item is an important consideration for transmission lines between components at different temperatures . in spite of copper s high thermal conductivity , the small metallic cross - section of planar lines results in a total heat flow along a flex circuit comparable to that through the much larger cross - sections of stainless steel and steel in standard cryogenic coaxial cable . with strength carried by the kapton substrate , and high - frequency fields confined to a thin layer near the conductor surfaces by the skin effect , very thin conductors are practical for the lines .",
    "the thinnest standard copper cladding on kapton is 0.5 oz .  per square foot , or 0.7mil ( 0.0007 in , @xmath0 m ) thick .",
    "calculated microstrip / coax heat flow ratios for typical thermal conductivities@xcite along an 8-circuit evaluation structure ( 8 parallel 11 mil strips on an 850 mil wide ground plane ) divided by that along 8 stainless - steel 085 coaxial cables are 0.66 for 297k77k end temperatures , and 2.9 for 77k20k . for microstriplines",
    "most of the thermal path is in the ground plane , so we investigated a patterned ground plane that reduced the amount of metal .",
    "we report measurements on two test structures .",
    "the first included microwave resonators to evaluate materials properties at 297 and 77k ( room temperature and liquid nitrogen ) .",
    "the second was a set of 8 parallel microstrip lines to evaluate multiple - line performance over two ground plane patterns .",
    "both structures were on dupont pyralux ap-8555r stock , which has 0.5oz / ft@xmath1 rolled@xcite copper bonded to both sides of 5mil thick polyimide substrate material .",
    "although thinner substrates are available , we chose 5mil mostly because of fabrication tolerances : with this thickness , the microstrip lines are 11mils wide , and a 10% width fabrication error still produces a line with an impedance close to @xmath2 . as secondary considerations ,",
    "electrical loss drops with increasing strip width , and an 11mil width is suitable for solder contact between sma connector pins and the strip .",
    "most flex circuits have a thin dielectric coverlay to protect the traces , but the adhesive has high electrical loss at microwave frequencies@xcite , so the test structures had no coverlays .",
    "a commercial firm fabricated transmission line test structures on a 1.5inch by 4.1 in substrate with a full ground plane on one side and three microstrip transmission lines across the short dimension on the other side .",
    "two of the lines had perpendicular shunt open stubs to make tee resonators , with stub lengths 3.000 and 0.550inch long .",
    "johnson 142 - 0701 - 851 edge connectors with 10mil diameter pins made contact with the lines and ground pads to either side of the line .",
    "gold plating ( 5@xmath3 in of gold on 100@xmath3 in nickel ) kept the traces from oxidizing while allowing wire bond and solder connections .",
    "the substrate shrinks little between room temperature and 77k while remaining flexible .",
    "there was no apparent bending or other thermally induced stress between the substrate and fully metalized ground plane when the test structure was immersed in liquid nitrogen .",
    "we corrected for resonator length change with cooling by measuring the length of the test substrate at room temperature and when immersed with a stainless steel scale in a shallow tray filled with liquid nitrogen ; the length change on cooling was only 5mil on the scale . after correcting for the scale s own fractional length contraction from 29377k@xcite we derived a substrate fractional length contraction of @xmath4 between 297 and 77k . at 77k ,",
    "the 3inch resonator was shorter by 13mils .",
    "all resonator measurements were in vacuum with the substrate attached to the cold plate of a small liquid nitrogen cryostat . a copper radiation shield attached to the cold plate and lined with",
    "microwave absorber covered the substrate to block infrared radiation that would otherwise heat the substrate .",
    "comparison of warm transmission with and without the copper cover showed that the cover did not affect microwave transmission .",
    "conformable 085 coaxial cables , 8 in long , connected the test structure to hermetic sma feedthroughs passing through the cryostat wall ; 3db attenuators between the cables and feedthroughs helped reduce residual standing waves .",
    "we made measurements of the resonators and the through on the test structure at 297 and 77k with an agilent 8722d vector network analyzer , sampling 201 points from 50mhz to 20ghz .    dividing the test structure s resonator transmission ( @xmath5 ) by that of the through line removed cable , attenuator , and connector losses , giving a clean measurement of the tee resonator alone .",
    "we used microwave office@xcite ( mwo ) for this division and to fit for substrate dielectric constant and loss tangent by comparing the derived values of @xmath5 to those from mwo s parametric models ( which include finite - element electromagnetic calculations for the discontinuities at the tee ) and optimization function .",
    "the topmost lines in figure  [ fig : fitplot ] display the cold measurement and the mwo model fit for the 3 in resonator .",
    "plots of the residuals between the two , as well as the residual for the warm measurements , shows that the models are good representations at both temperatures .",
    "structure at higher frequencies is common to both warm and cold resonators and is probably due to different connector mismatches in the resonator and through lines .",
    "the overall agreement between measurement and theory indicates that the materials parameters we derive are valid to at least 20ghz .    ,",
    "width=288 ]    table  [ tab : table ] summarizes derived electrical properties .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath6 changed by a negligible amount between room temperature and 77k ; a representative value for microwave frequencies is @xmath7 .",
    "there is a weak dependence on the fit frequency range , 0.05ghz to @xmath8 , for @xmath6 , which is just visible in plots for different frequencies .",
    "both dielectric and metalization losses contribute to overall loss , but the fits were insensitive to losses in the metal , parametrized by conductivity @xmath9 relative to gold , and we used a value of @xmath10 .",
    "loss in the dielectric drops by a factor of approximately two on cooling , from @xmath11 to 0.007 .",
    ".dielectric constants @xmath6 and loss tangents @xmath12 derived from resonator measurements at 297 and 77k , with fitting from 0.05ghz to @xmath8 .",
    "the change in @xmath6 with frequency shows a small amount of frequency dependence .",
    "the change in @xmath6 with temperature is negligible for most purposes .",
    "loss has a clear temperature dependence , however , with @xmath12 dropping by a factor of @xmath13 on cooling .",

    "we directly assessed the performance of microwave interconnects with a structure with eight parallel microstrip transmission lines with strip widths of 11mil on 100mil centers ( gaps between lines equal to 8.1 times the strip widths ) .",
    "the minimum line length was 8.5 in , and the maximum was 11.7 in .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : parallellines ] , four of the lines were over a solid ground plane , and the other four were over a patterned ground plane with reduced thermal conductivity .",
    "the patterning was a solid plane 55mils wide below each 11mil - wide line , providing termination for most of the field lines , with 10mil - wide cross - strips on 80mil centers tying the grounds together across the width of the structure .",
    "the cross - strips must have spacing with distance well below a quarter of the shortest wavelength to avoid resonances between the lines , and @xmath14 or closer to reduce structure in @xmath15 . with a pattern of relatively narrow ground planes under the lines , joined by thin cross - connects , the calculated heat flow along the structure is a factor of three lower than a solid ground plane .",
    "broader ground strips under the lines would reduce cross talk at the cost of higher thermal conductivity .",
    "reducing line widths on a thinner substrate is an additional attractive solution at low temperatures , where the electrical loss is lower , although fabrication tolerances may become critical .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] shows the transmission loss and cross - coupling for the 10.6inch lines over the two ground planes .",
    "cross - coupling in this plot is to a nearest - neighbor line with 8.2inches of parallel run ; the nearest neighbor on the other side has 8.8inches of parallel run .",
    "the transmission loss is only slightly higher for the patterned ground plane , but the cross talk is substantially higher : the far - out field lines carry little power but are responsible for cross - coupling , and are poorly terminated on the strips between the transmission lines .",
    "transmission loss for this structure with a solid ground plane is closely 0.076db / ghz / in .",
    "a model fit over 0.05ghz12ghz gives @xmath16 , slightly higher than the fit to the room - temperature resonator data , @xmath11 .",
    "loss from cross - coupling between lines is present and is accurately predicted by coupled - line microstrip theory .",
    "modeling for other spacings shows cross - talk decreases with increasing spacing and frequency , but has periodic maxima with line length , as expected for a forward - coupled pair of lines@xcite : mwo calculations yield 20db maxima for gaps of 6.5 time the strip widths , and 30db for 12 times the strip widths . for comparison ,",
    "standard 085 semi - rigid cryogenic coaxial cable ( stainless steel outer jacket , teflon insulation , silver - plated steel wire center conductor ) has a loss of about 0.0125db / ghz / in and essentially infinite isolation , but with little possibility for mass connection .",
