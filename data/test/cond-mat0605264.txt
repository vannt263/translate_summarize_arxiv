    "the quantum mechanical spin degree of freedom is now widely exploited to control current transport in electronic devices .",
    "for instance , the readout of magnetic hard disks is based on the spin - valve effect , i.e. the tunability of a conductance through the relative orientation of some ferromagnetic polarizations @xcite . however , realizing spin injection in mesoscopic conductors would allow to implement further functionalities , like e.g. a gate control of the spin valve effect @xcite .",
    "importantly , electronic interaction effects can occur in mesoscopic structures , due to the electronic confinement .",
    "this raises the fundamental question of the interplay between spin - dependent transport and electronic interactions .    upon scattering on the interface between a ferromagnet ( f ) and a non - magnetic material , electrons with spin",
    "parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization of f can pick up different phase shifts , because they are affected by different scattering potentials .",
    "this _ spin - dependence _ of interfacial phase shifts ( sdips ) can modify significantly the behavior of mesoscopic circuits .",
    "first , when a mesoscopic conductor is connected to several f leads with non collinear polarizations , the sdips produces an interfacial precession of spins which can modify current transport in the device @xcite . secondly , in collinear configurations , precession effects are not relevant , but",
    "the sdips can modify mesoscopic coherence effects .",
    "for instance , in superconducting / ferromagnetic hybrid circuits , the sdips introduces a phase shift between electron and holes correlated by andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "references and have identified signatures of this effect in the experiments of refs . and , respectively . in principle , normal systems in collinear configurations can also be affected by the sdips . indeed , from ref .",
    ", the sdips should produce a spin - splitting of the resonant states in a ballistic interactionless wire contacted with collinearly polarized ferromagnetic leads .",
    "however , this has not been confirmed experimentally yet @xcite .     and @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetic polarizations @xmath6 and @xmath7 of leads @xmath8 and @xmath5 can be parallel ( configuration p ) or antiparallel ( configuration ap ) .",
    "the element m is capacitively coupled to a gate voltage source @xmath1 . ]    recently , ref .",
    "has reported current measurements in a single wall carbon nanotube ( swnt ) connected to two ferromagnetic leads with collinear polarizations .",
    "the asymmetries observed in the magnetoresistance ( @xmath0 ) of the swnt versus gate voltage are strikingly similar to those predicted by ref . for an interactionless wire subject to the sdips@xcite . however ,",
    "the swnt of ref . showed a quantum dot behavior with strong coulomb blockade effects , as demonstrated in a great number of experiments with non - magnetic leads ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one important question is how interaction effects modify the scheme proposed by ref . .",
    "the problem of the effects of interactions on the transport properties of a central region connected to ferromagnetic contacts has already been considered in various regimes , like e.g. the coulomb blockade regime@xcite , the kondo regime@xcite , the luttinger liquid regime@xcite and the marginal fermi liquid regime@xcite .",

    "*  * * we use an anderson model to study the @xmath0 of the circuit above the kondo temperature , but beyond the sequential tunneling limit .",
    "the sdips is taken into account through an effective spin - splitting of the dot energy levels .",
    "this splitting makes easier negative @xmath0 effects .",
    "when it is strong enough , it can even lead to a giant @xmath0 with a sign oscillating with the dot gate voltage @xmath1 , similarly to what has been found in the non - interacting case . in the non - interacting case , assuming that the properties of the contact are constant with energy and that the sdips is too weak to split the conductance peaks , one finds that the @xmath4 pattern is similar for all conductance peaks .",
    "in contrast , the effect of the sdips depends on the occupation of the dot in the interacting case .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction with the data of ref . because , in the @xmath3range presented in this ref .",

    "2-c and fig . 2-e , plotted for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the left [ right ] conductance peak",
    "is shifted to the right [ left ] from @xmath34 to @xmath15 because it mainly comes from the transport of up [ down ] spins  in the @xmath34  case ( this can be seen from the average occupations of the levels versus @xmath1 in fig .",

    "[ figure2 ] , @xmath0 becomes negative for certain values of gate voltage .",

    "if @xmath33 is strong enough , it can even produce a giant @xmath0 effect with its sign tunable with @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]-f ) .",
    "moreover , because of the opposite shifts of the two consecutive conductance peaks for @xmath13 with respect to those for @xmath118 , the positive - and - then - negative profile of mr corresponding to one conductance peak is generally followed by the negative - and - then - positive profile near the next conductance peak ( approximately mirror symmetric ) . note that a sign change @xmath119 will not modify this behavior for the low values of polarizations considered here , because the spin with lower[higher ] orbital energy will dominate in the left [ right ] peak of @xmath36 .",
    "we now compare the results of this section with the experimental data of ref . .",
    "like many coulomb blockade devices , the circuit studied in this experiment suffered from low frequency @xmath1-noise , which can be attributed to charge fluctuators located in the vicinity of the device .",
    "a strong gate voltage offset jump occurred at @xmath120 , and the data before and after this jump do not necessarily correspond to the filling of consecutive levels .",

    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "these data display almost 2 regular @xmath4 oscillations , which can not be understood with the 1-orbital model .",
    "indeed , as explained above , in this model , the two conductance peaks of @xmath123 are shifted in opposite directions by @xmath33 . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath4 variations corresponding to these two peaks can not be similar for parameters consistent with the experiment .",
    "we have shown here curves for @xmath52 , but a finite @xmath124 would not modify this result . using values of @xmath112 larger than in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] would not help either .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have considered in this section the one - orbital case . in reality , there are more than one orbital levels on a quantum dot .",
    "as long as these levels are sufficiently well separated from each other ( roughly , by an orbital energy difference larger than the hund - rule exchange energy ) , the two conductance peaks associated to a given level will occur consecutively in @xmath23 and will thus be described qualitatively like above@xcite .",
    "in particular , the two peaks will be shifted in opposite directions by @xmath125 ; the first peak to lower values of @xmath1 and the second peak to higher values .",
    "therefore , this limit should not allow to obtain two consecutive conductance peaks with analogue @xmath126  patterns .",
    "on the contrary , if two ( or more ) levels are nearly degenerate , it is possible that the orbital levels of the quantum dot are not filled one by one while increasing @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , consecutive conductance peaks may exhibit a qualitatively different behavior compared with the one - orbital case . to examine this effect",
    ", we will consider in next section the extreme case of a quantum dot with a twofold orbital degeneracy .",
    "we will see that the discrepancy between the theory and the data can be resolved by using this model .    before concluding this section",
    ", we make a remark on another possible contribution to the spin splitting of the conductance peaks .",
    "even though so far we have mainly considered the contribution from the sdips , in principle , virtual particle exchange processes with the spin - polarized leads can also renormalize the energy levels through the @xmath127 terms of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath104 terms are not negligible in general . for example , in fig .",
    "[ figure2]-a , they globally shift the position of the conductance peaks in @xmath36 by about @xmath128  of @xmath129 .",
    "nevertheless ,  for the low values of polarizations @xmath112  and the temperatures used here , the level spin - splitting produced by the @xmath104 terms is much weaker than this global shift and can not compete with the finite values of @xmath33 considered in this article .",
    "in order to improve the understanding of ref . , we  now take into account the @xmath130-@xmath131 orbital degeneracy commonly observed@xcite in swnts , by considering a two - orbitals model i.e. hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "interestingly , su(4 ) kondo effect involving the orbital and spin degrees of freedom was observed in swnts with the @xmath130-@xmath131 degeneracy @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , in this system , the orbital quantum number is conserved during higher order tunnel events , probably because the electrons of the nanotube quantum dot are coupled to the nanotube section underneath the contacts , where they dwell for some time before moving into the metal . for simplicity",

    "we now discuss the value of @xmath196 found for the above fit .",
    "this corresponds to a magnetic field of about @xmath197 , which is too strong to be attributed to stray fields from the ferromagnetic electrodes ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "this is in favor of generalizing the sdips concept to swnts quantum dots circuits , i.e. considering that the energy levels of the dot are spin - split because the confinement potential created by the ferromagnetic electrodes is spin - dependent . for comparison ,",
    "we have estimated @xmath98 in the non - interacting theory@xcite , using realistic parameters i.e leads with a fermi energy @xmath198   and a density of states polarized by @xmath199 , and a nanotube with fermi wavevector @xmath200  @xmath201 , fermi velocity@xcite @xmath202  @xmath203 , length @xmath204   like in ref . , and density of states @xmath205 .",

    "figure  [ figure4 ] shows examples of @xmath184  curves plotted for a finite @xmath124 . using @xmath186  ( green dashed curve ) enhances the fit of the @xmath184  at peak 2 whereas @xmath185  ( blue dot - dashed curve ) enhances the fit of the @xmath184  at peak 3 .",
    "interestingly , with the non - interacting model , assuming the most simple situation in which @xmath214  has the same sign for the two leads , one finds @xmath215 ,  which is in agreement with the values used here .",
    "the fact that the best fit for the @xmath184  patterns at peaks 2 and 3 correspond to different values of @xmath216  might be due to a gate dependence of the sdips .",
    "this is indeed possible since the potential profile of the interfaces between the wire and the leads can vary with @xmath1 .",
    "we now comment briefly on the data taken for @xmath217v .",
    "it is not sure that the data shown before and after @xmath120v correspond to the filling of consecutive levels because of the gate voltage jump which occured at this value of @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the mr curve corresponding to @xmath217v is rather consistent with the theory shown in fig .",
    "this suggests that these data really correspond to peak 1 . at this stage",
    ", it is important to point out that other orbital levels not taken into account in our calculation should slightly modify the conductance peaks 1 and 4 .",
    "the discrepancy between the theory and the data for @xmath217v could be explained by the effect of the other orbitals . for the data at @xmath218v ,",
    "our fit is more quantitative since we have used peaks 2 and 3 of the theory .    in principle",
    ", the modelisation of the orbital levels in swnts can be refined by taking into account an exchange energy @xmath219  which favors spin alignment , an excess coulomb energy @xmath220  related to the double occupation of the same orbital , and a subband mismatch @xmath221  ( see ref . ) .",
    "in practice , @xmath220  is rather small but @xmath219  and @xmath222  can be of the same order as @xmath150 .",
    "two different regimes of parameters can occur in practice . if @xmath223 , two electrons with opposite spins will fill consecutively the same energy level while @xmath1 increases ( see refs . ) , and the behavior of the device should thus be analogue to the non - degenerate multi - orbital case evoked at the end of section [ sec : single - level ] .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath224 , peaks 1 and 2 [ 3 and 4 ] will correspond in majority to the same spin direction , as observed experimentally by . in this case , the effect of @xmath225  should be qualitatively the same as described in the present section .",
    "we expect that the weights of k and k in peaks 1 and 2 differ due to @xmath226 ,  but this should not change the way in which @xmath33  shifts the conductance peaks from @xmath34  to @xmath15 .    in future experiments",
    ", it would be interesting to obtain continuous data on a larger @xmath1-range , in order to check that the shape of the @xmath126 pattern depends on the occupation of the dot .",
    "this would also allow to study the gate voltage dependence of @xmath33 .",
    "it would also be interesting to engineer contacts with ferromagnetic insulators or highly polarized ferromagnets in order to observe the sdips - induced giant @xmath184 effect .",
    "note that although we have considered here the limit @xmath227 , a strong enough sdips should also affect the behavior of the quantum dot in the sequential tunneling limit @xmath228 , through an analogous mechanism .",
    "using an anderson model , we have studied the behavior of a quantum dot connected to ferromagnetic leads through spin - active interfaces .",
    "the spin activity of the interfaces makes easier negative magnetoresistance ( @xmath0 ) effects and can even lead to a giant @xmath0 with a sign oscillating with the gate voltage of the dot . due to coulomb blockade",
    ", the @xmath0 versus gate voltage pattern can not be identical for all conductance peaks .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to account for the @xmath0 data measured by ref . in single - wall carbon nanotubes by taking into account the @xmath9 orbital degeneracy commonly observed in those systems .",
