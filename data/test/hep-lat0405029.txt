    "under ordinary laboratory conditions quarks and gluons , the fundamental constituents of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , are bound into hadrons . however , as the temperature or density is increased , the forces among quarks and gluons weaken , and one expects to find a phase transition or crossover to a new state of matter , a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the plasma was a dominant state of matter in the early development of the universe , and a primary objective of current relativistic heavy ion collision experiments is to observe the plasma and determine its properties .",
    "the behavior of strongly interacting matter in the vicinity of the phase transition or crossover is inherently a strong coupling problem , which at present can only be addressed from first principles through lattice gauge theory calculations . among the issues that can uniquely be addressed by lattice calculations",
    "are the nature of the transition and the temperature at which it occurs , the properties of the plasma , including strange quark content , and the equation of state  @xcite",
    ".    in this paper we report on a study of the phase diagram of high temperature qcd with three flavors of quarks using improved gauge and quark actions  @xcite .",
    "most lattice studies of high temperature qcd have included only the up and down quarks , but the inclusion of the strange quark is an important feature of our work  @xcite . from chiral models",
    "it is expected that with two flavors of quarks there is no phase transition at all for physical values of the up and down quark masses ; however , a strange quark could induce a first order transition , or move a second order critical point closer to physical quark masses  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the production of strangeness is expected to be an important signal for the plasma in heavy ion experiments .",
    "we are considering two cases in our study : 1 ) all three quarks have the same mass @xmath6 ; and 2 ) the two lightest mass quarks have equal mass @xmath7 , while the mass of the third quark is fixed at approximately that of the strange quark @xmath4 .",
    "we refer to these cases as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . for @xmath8",
    "we have worked with quark masses in the range @xmath10 , while for @xmath9 we have carried out simulations with @xmath11 .",
    "we have monitored standard thermodynamic quantities such as the plaquette , the polyakov loop , the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility . for the quark masses we have studied to date",
    ", we find rapid crossovers , which sharpen as the quark mass is reduced , rather than a _ bona fide _ phase transition .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier work  @xcite .",
    "we have also measured the quark number susceptibilities , which provide excellent signals for the crossover , and which are directly related to event - by - event fluctuations in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the data indicate that our results for these susceptibilities are quite close to their continuum values .",
    "our simulations are carried out with a one - loop symanzik improved gauge action  @xcite and the asqtad quark action  @xcite .",
    "both the gauge and quark actions have all lattice artifacts removed through order @xmath12 at tree level , where @xmath13 is the lattice spacing , and are tadpole improved .",
    "thus , the leading order finite lattice spacing artifacts are of order @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we and others have used this action over the last few years to perform a wide variety of zero - temperature calculations  @xcite .",
    "it has a number of features that make it particularly well suited for high temperature studies .",
    "the asqtad action has considerably better dispersion relations for free quarks than the standard kogut - susskind and wilson actions  @xcite , which markedly decreases lattice artifacts above the transition .",
    "this is also true of the p4 action used by the bielefeld group in its studies of high temperature qcd  @xcite .",
    "the improvement in dispersion relations is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : epqfig ] , where we plot the energy , pressure and quark number susceptibility for free massless quarks as a function of lattice spacing .",
    "the asqtad action exhibits excellent scaling properties in the lattice spacing  @xcite , which accelerates the approach to the continuum limit .",
    "finally , taste symmetry breaking is much smaller for the asqtad action , than for the conventional kogut - susskind action .",
    "our spectrum studies with the asqtad action indicate that for lattices with eight to ten time slices , the kaon is heavier than the heaviest non - goldstone pion in the neighborhood of the finite temperature transition or crossover , a condition which requires much smaller lattice spacings with the conventional kogut - susskind action .",
    "it is , of course , difficult to study the effects of the strange quark on the transition if this condition is not fulfilled .",
    "we have used the refreshed hybrid molecular dynamics r  algorithm  @xcite to generate gauge configurations . in integrating the molecular dynamics equations of motion",
    "we used a time step @xmath16 equal to the smaller of 0.02 and @xmath17 .",
    "the momenta conjugate to the gauge fields were refreshed every molecular dynamics time unit , which consisted of @xmath18 time steps . in the vicinity of the crossover we generated 2,000 equilibrated molecular dynamics time units at each value of the gauge coupling and quark masses we studied .",
    "the runs well above and below the crossover were shorter .",
    "measurements of standard thermodynamics quantities were made after each time unit , and gauge configurations were saved every five time units for separate measurements of the quark number and @xmath19 susceptibilities .",
    "ten random sources were used in the measurements of @xmath19 made at the end of each time unit , and 100 random sources were used in the calculations of the susceptibilities .",
    "the values of the chiral order parameter obtained in these two measurements agreed to within statistics .",
    "we have attempted to vary the temperature while keeping all other physical quantities constant . to this end , for the @xmath8 study we have performed a set of spectrum calculations at lattice spacings @xmath20  fm and 0.18  fm with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we determine the lattice spacing from the static @xmath25 potential , and express it and other dimensionful quantities in terms of @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 .",
    "using results from the 1s-2s and 1p-1s splitting in the @xmath28 spectrum  @xcite , we have found @xmath29  fm in the continuum and chiral limits  @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath4 from the requirement that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an `` unmixed '' pseudoscalar meson made of an @xmath32 and @xmath33 quark .",
    "we would like to carry out our thermodynamics studies with three equal mass quarks for @xmath34 fixed , but this quantity will , of course , vary slightly with lattice spacing if we keep @xmath35 fixed .",
    "so , at @xmath36  fm we perform linear interpolations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the quark mass to determine the precise values of @xmath6 for which @xmath34 will take on the values found at @xmath20  fm .",
    "then to determine the values of @xmath39 , @xmath13 and @xmath40 for thermodynamics studies with other values of @xmath13 , we perform interpolations or extrapolations with a form due to allton , inspired by asymptotic freedom  @xcite .",
    "we first define    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the universal beta - function coefficients for massless three - flavor qcd , and @xmath44 is the bare lattice coupling .",
    "@xmath45 is basically @xmath46 .",

    "the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined from the measured values of @xmath51 at @xmath36 and 0.125  fm .",
    "a similar interpolation formula is used to determine the lattice quark mass along the line of fixed @xmath34 ,    @xmath52 .",

    "however , use of the more sophisticated formulae became critical for points outside the anchors .",
    "our approach for thermodynamics studies with @xmath56 is quite similar . in this case",
    "we wish to vary the temperature keeping both @xmath57 and @xmath34 fixed .",
    "we have carried out spectrum studies at @xmath20 and 0.18  fm for light quark masses @xmath58 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath59 , and at @xmath60  fm with @xmath61 , @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath59 all with the mass of the heavy quark fixed close to @xmath4  @xcite . the strange quark mass was determined from the spectrum calculations with three equal mass quarks . in our spectrum",
    "runs at @xmath20  fm  @xcite we found that @xmath62 varied by less than 2% and @xmath38 by less than 1% for @xmath63 , and the heavy quark mass held fixed at @xmath4 .",
    "so , the neglect of the dependence of @xmath62 and @xmath38 on @xmath7 is well justified . in these studies we performed linear interpolations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 at @xmath36  fm to determine the values of @xmath7 for which @xmath66 takes on the values found at @xmath20  fm .",
    "then , for other values of @xmath13 we interpolate or extrapolate @xmath51 using eq.([eq : interpa ] ) , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 using eq.([eq : interpm ] ) .",
    "we again determine the values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 from the spectrum runs at @xmath20  fm and 0.18  fm . for @xmath61 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath59 , where we have spectrum data at @xmath71  fm",
    ", we can add @xmath72 terms to the right hand sides of eqs.([eq : interpa ] ) and  ( [ eq : interpm ] ) .",
    "these added terms make only a few percent difference in the lattice spacing and quark masses extrapolated to @xmath73 , giving us confidence in the interpolations and extrapolations used in our study .",
