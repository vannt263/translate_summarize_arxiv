    "however , previous lbms are just solvers of traditional hydrodynamic equations , such as navier - stokes ( ns ) equations . to obtain a deeper insight into both the hne and tne effects that are beyond the description of traditional hydrodynamic models , we resort to the lattice boltzmann kinetic method which is also named discrete boltzmann method ( dbm ) @xcite . in 2016 , via the dbm , lai et al .",

    "those non - equilibrium manifestations are weakened , and the early reducing trend is particularly suppressed and even eliminated .",
    "hence , with increasing reynolds number , the three tendencies may be reduced to two ones ( increasing and decreasing tendencies ) in the whole process . for all cases , the non - equilibrium manifestations approach to zero when the mixing between media reaches saturation finally .",
    "the physical reasons for the manifestations in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] are similar to those in fig .",

    "[ fig06 ] , although the results of @xmath205 are qualitatively similar to @xmath208 , the former is an order of magnitude smaller than the latter .",
    "the physical reason needs to be studied in future .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , the invariants ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath209 ) of the tensor @xmath210 have behaviours quite similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] ( not shown here ) .",
    "in addition , since non - equilibrium manifestations are obvious for sharp physical gradients @xcite , the initial non - equilibrium manifestations enhance with reducing initial interface width @xmath149 .      compared with the lbm / dbm for single component systems , this model has the capability of investigating entropy of mixing , @xmath211 in thermodynamics , the entropy of mixing is a portion of the total entropy .",
    "it increases when several separate parts of components are mixed without chemical reaction before the establishment of a new thermodynamic equilibrium state in a closed system .",

    "it can be found that the area for @xmath212 enlarges as the material interface widens and lengthens with time . to have a quantitative study",
    ", we calculate @xmath213 where the integral is extended over the whole region .",
    "figure [ fig08 ] depicts the entropy of mixing @xmath213 ( a ) and its growth rate ( b ) in the three runs of rt instability .",
    "it is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] ( a ) that the entropy of mixing increases monotonously as the two miscible media mix in the evolution of rt instability . in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] ( b ) , the growth rate of entropy of mixing shows decreasing , increasing , and then decreasing trends in three different stages . for large reynolds number , the reducing growth rate in the early stage is particularly suppressed and even eliminated because of the slow diffusion .",
    "physically , there are competitive mechanisms between the decreasing values of gradients particle number density and increasing area of material interface in the mixing process .",
    "initially , the values of gradients are large , and the diffusion between the two media is quick . in the mixing process , the decreasing values of gradients make the mixing slow , while the increasing contact area between the two media makes the mixing quick . finally , the mixing becomes slow again when the mixing starts to saturate .    in the initial stage , from @xmath178",
    "to about @xmath214 , both the entropy of mixing and its growth rate are higher for large viscosity ( low reynolds number ) than for small viscosity ( high reynolds number ) .",
    "afterwards , the rates in the three runs complete with each other .",
    "finally , the entropies of mixing in the three runs coincide with each other and all the growth rates approach zero when the media are adequately mixed . physically , the growth rate is high and the diffusion is fast when the viscosity of the two media is high .",
    "and the viscosity dominates in the early stage .",
    "in addition , for large viscosity , the diffusion process is fast , and the physical gradients are smoothed quickly which makes the mixing slow .",
    "furthermore , for large viscosity , the evolution of rt instability becomes slow in the later stage , and the growth rate of the contact area reduces , which decreases the mixing growth rate .",
    "a dbm is proposed for a system containing two components in a gravitational field .",
    "the two components , which can have different specific heat ratios , are described by two coupled discrete boltzmann equations .",
    "the discrete equilibrium distribution functions are calculated from the hydrodynamic velocity and temperature of the whole system , and the density of each species .",
    "two types of force term , which are equivalent at the level of the first order accuracy , are introduced to describe the gravitational effects .",
    "the discrete velocities for the two discrete boltzmann equations are independent .",
    "this flexibility can be used to improve the numerical robustness .",
    "this model is validated and verified both theoretically and numerically .",
    "theoretically , the ns equations can be obtained from this model via the chapman - enskog multiscale analysis .",
    "numerically , the dbm results are consistent with the exact solutions in the simulation of free fall .    in this work ,",
    "the dbm is used to investigate the non - equilibrium rt instability at three reynolds numbers .",
    "we prove the global effects of thermodynamic non - equilibrium manifestations , including the  fluctuation of translational energies \" and  non - organized energy flux \" , in the computational space . for low reynolds number ,",
    "those non - equilibrium manifestations show decreasing , increasing , and then decreasing trends . for high reynolds number",
    ", they are weakened , and the early reducing trend is particularly suppressed and even eliminated . it is interesting to find that the growth rate of the entropy of mixing demonstrates behaviors similar to the global effects of those non - equilibrium manifestations .",
    "this is because there are competitive effects on the non - equilibrium manifestations and the growth of the entropy of mixing in the process : ( i ) the increasing material interface enhances them ; ( ii ) the reducing physical gradients weaken them ; ( iii ) the fast diffusion enlarges them ; ( iv ) the large viscosity suppresses the growth of material interface .",
    "apart from its capability of an ns model describing the fluid flows , the dbm can also be used to probe more details of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic non - equilibrium manifestations .",
    "and we introduce some significant invariants of tensors of those non - equilibrium manifestations .",
