    "the presence and location of corotation resonances in barred spiral galaxies is important for several reasons .",
    "first , resonances are required by density wave theory , so their existence would be evidence that supports the theory .",
    "second , the corotation resonance of a bar is related to the ability to transfer angular momentum outwards , or material inwards .",
    "this is the main process that drives the secular evolution of a galaxy .",
    "also , resonances can scatter stellar orbits and cause disk heating . finally , the corotation radius of barred galaxies is related to the bar pattern speed .",
    "fast bars may indicate low concentration central dark matter halos due to decreased dynamical friction ( debbatista & sellwood 2000 ) .",
    "current methods of measuring corotation resonance ( cr ) radii and/or bar pattern speeds , e.g. , computer simulations ( rautiainen et al .  2008 ; treuthardt et al .",
    "2012 ) , the tremaine - weinberg method ( tremaine & weinberg 1984 ; hereafter tw ) , etc . , require extensive computer and telescope time , the presence of specific morphological features , or other limiting factors . the tw method directly measures the bar pattern speed , but it requires a lot of telescope time .",
    "also , it is only useful on galaxies where the bar major axis and galaxy major axis are offset by 45@xmath9 , or as close to 45@xmath9 as possible .",
    "this severely limits the number of galaxies you can analyze with the tw method .",
    "therefore , other methods have been found to estimate the bar pattern speed , such as the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 , which estimates the relative bar pattern speed .",
    "@xmath5 is defined as the bar corotation radius divided by the bar radius , @xmath10 .",
    "when finding the relative bar pattern speed , the focus is on determining the radius of the bar s corotation resonance . rather than make use of tw , it would be beneficial to have a faster , cheaper , but reliable method for determining corotation resonance radii and relative bar pattern speeds .",
    "puerari & dottori ( 1997 ; hereafter pd ) present such a method . in this study , we use the pd method to measure the cr radii and relative bar pattern speed of 15 barred spiral galaxies that already have cr measurements elsewhere in the literature .    resonances are predicted by density wave theory , which was originally proposed by lin & shu ( 1964 ) .",
    "further developments of the theory have led to the modal theory of spiral structure ( e.g. , bertin et al .",
    "1989a , b ; bertin 1993 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) . in these models ,",
    "the spiral density wave has a pattern speed which is independent of the orbital speeds of stars and gas in the disk .",
    "if the relative velocities between the gas and the density wave are supersonic , a shock front may be formed ( roberts 1969 ; binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "the shock compresses the gas , which after a time delay leads to star formation on the side of the arm opposite the shock front ( seigar & james 2002 ) .    when observed in",
    "the near - infrared , about two - thirds of all disk galaxies seem to have a bar - like structure with their own pattern speeds ( seigar et al .",
    "1998 ; eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ; hernandez et al .",
    "2005 ) . in barred - spiral galaxies",
    ", the bar forcing influences the spiral arm amplitudes .",
    "specifically , salo et al .  ( 2010 ) found a strong correlation between the local tangential bar torque , @xmath11 , and the local spiral arm amplitude , @xmath12 , out to 1.5 bar lengths .",
    "this suggests that the inner portions of spiral arms may be either a continuation of the bar mode or they are driven by bar forcing itself .",
    "further out , the spirals are most likely independent modes , and the disk pattern speed becomes the dominant factor . the radius where the angular velocity of the stars is equal to a pattern speed is called a corotation radius . according to contopoulos ( 1980 ) , the radius of the bar can not be larger than its corotation radius , or the bar would not be self - sustaining ( i.e. , it simply would not exist ) .",
    "note that buta & zhang ( 2009 ) find some bars that are larger than their cr radii , but this is considered controversial .",
    "beckman & cepa ( 1990 ) showed that azimuthal color profiles of galaxies can be a useful tool in studying spiral galaxies .",
    "phase shifts in the profiles of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 band can highlight star - forming regions in galaxies .",
    "pd expanded on the findings of beckman & cepa ( 1990 ) by showing that phase crossings of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands indicate a corotation radius .",
    "the motion of the spiral density wave creates a shock front inducing star formation .",
    "because new stars are bluer than older stars , the side of the spiral arm with the shock front should be bluer .",
    "inside corotation the material speed is greater than the bar pattern speed .",
    "this means that the inner edge of the spiral pattern is bluer than the outer edge .",
    "this is because gas clouds enter the density wave and create a shock front as they enter .",
    "bright , blue , newly formed stars then appear downstream of this shock . outside corotation",
    "the bar pattern speed is faster and the color of the two sides switch . at corotation",
    "the bar pattern speed and material speed are equal . at this radius the shock wave switches sides .",
    "we refer the reader to pd ( their figure 1 ) to see how the shock front would switch sides at the cr .",
    "pd describes the photometric method for determining corotation radius and included two example galaxies , ngc 7479 and ngc 1832 .",
    "aguerri , beckman & prieto ( 1998 ) reported the cr , determined by using the pd method , for 10 galaxies . during the next decade , references were made to the pd method ( e.g. , aguerri et al .",
    "2000 ; rautiainen , salo & laurikainen 2008 ) but its usage was absent from the literature .",
    "martnez - garca et al .",
    "( 2009a ) reported their results on the relationship between color gradients and pattern speed .",
    "they found that 10 out of the 13 barred and non - barred spiral galaxies in their sample showed color gradients that matched the theoretical predictions .",
    "martnez - garca et al .",
    "( 2009b ) describe the effect non - circular motions have on the azimuthal color gradient .",
    "the initial assumptions for the formation of a color gradient involved the collision of a spiral density wave and the disc material , whose orbital velocities decrease with radial distance .",
    "martnez - garca et al .",
    "( 2009b ) showed that legitimate color gradients could form in galaxies even if the disc material moved in non - circular orbits .    finally , martnez - garca & puerari ( 2014 ) reported results using the pd method on 9 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "instead of using optical wavebands , they used hi , co , 24-@xmath15 m , and fuv wavebands .",
    "they were able to find phase shifts .",
    "as noted in previous work by martnez - garc et al .  ( 2009a ) , color gradients are common in spiral arms .",
    "although the gradients do not always occur across a large enough radial range to be sufficient for finding resonance locations , martnez - garca & gonzlez - lpezlira ( 2013 ) found that at least 50% of their studied objects did have a sizeable region of color gradients in the spiral arms .",
    "martnez - garca & puerari ( 2014 ) showed that the phase shifts discovered in two arm spirals are different for the two arms .",
    "however , they were looking for the spiral arm pattern speed . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the bar pattern speed , which occurs very near the end of the bar which is more symmetrical in nature .    an alternative theory of spiral structure , particularly in barred galaxies ,",
    "is refered to as manifold theory ( romero - gmez et al .",
    "2006 ; romero - gmez et al .",
    "2007 , athanassoula et al .",
    "2009a , b ; athanassoula et al . 2010 ) .",
    "these authors studied the orbits of individual particles .",
    "athanassoula summarizes one of the differences between manifold and spiral density wave theory as : `` in density wave theory , the arms are loci of density maxima .",
    "particles should thus traverse the arms , but stay longer in the arm than in the interarm region ( lin & shu 1964 ) .",
    "this is totally different from our manifold theory , where spiral arms should be a bundle of orbits guided by the manifolds , so that particles should move along the arms rather than across them '' ( athanassoula 2012 ) .",
    "if the stars or particles travel along the arms instead of across them , then any age gradients or color gradients should also be along the arms instead of across them .",
    "therefore , if we could show many examples of age gradients across spiral arms , this would favor density wave theory over manifold theory .    as well as the pd method ,",
    "multiple methods for finding the @xmath16 have been developed .",
    "a few example methods are listed below .",
    "* morphological , e.g. , rings ( patsis et al .  2003 ) : the rings of galaxies can be related to resonances locations .",
    "the nuclear , inner , and outer rings can be linked to the inner lindblad resonance , inner ultraharmonic resonances , and outer lindblad resonances . *",
    "computer modeling , e.g. , sticky - particle ( rautianien et al .",
    "2008 ; treuthardt et al .",
    "2012 ) or hydrodynamics ( lin , yuan & buta 2008 ) : virtual particles are used to simulate the response of gas clouds in a gravitational potential . * phase shift between potential and density ( zhang & buta 2007 ) : a method for determining the corotation radii and pattern speed of galactic density waves using the azimuthal phase shift between the potential and density wave patterns .    in this paper",
    ", we use the results of our pd analysis and compare them to the latter two methods described above .",
    "we do not make any comparisons with the first method , since the method has large uncertainties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the dataset and methods used ; section 3 presents the corotation radii that we have determined ; section 4 presents and discusses our results ; and in section 5 we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "[ efigi ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     two of the 57 galaxies had 3 major phase crossings .",
    "all three crossings are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the third phase crossing might correspond to the spiral arm pattern speed ( cepa & beckman 1990 , their figure 1 ) .",
    "the pixel scale ( in @xmath17/pixel ) for pgc 37091 is 0.32 .",
    "the difference between cr2 and cr is @xmath18 pixels or @xmath19 and the difference between cr3 and cr is @xmath20 .",
    "the pixel scale for pgc 42575 is 0.51 .",
    "the difference between cr2 and cr is @xmath21 pixels or @xmath22 .",
    "however cr3 is separated from cr by @xmath23 .      for sticky - particle simulations a near - infrared image",
    "is used to derive a gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "then `` sticky '' particles , i.e. , particles that lose energy in collisions , are used to model the response of the cold gas component of the galaxy to the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "the dynamical parameters of the computer simulation are varied until the simulated galaxy s morphology , such as rings and arm curvature , matches the real galaxy image ( e.g. , rautiainen et al .",
    "2008 ; treuthardt et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "the spiral arms are matched by comparing their location , pitch angle , and extent .",
    "using this method the pattern speed that fits the outer parts of the galaxy might be different from the pattern speed for the fit for the inner parts .",
    "a possible explanation for this difference is that different galaxy morphological features may have different pattern speeds ( i.e. , a bar may have a different pattern speed when compared to spiral arms ; see e.g. , sellwood & sparke 1988 ) .",
    "when rautiainen et al . encountered multiple fits , they chose the lowest relative pattern speed to represent the bar s pattern speed ( rautiainen et al .",
    "2008 ) .    to validate the pd method ,",
    "a sample of barred spiral galaxies , with previously determined relative bar pattern speeds , @xmath5 , were chosen from the efigi dataset .",
    "the sample galaxies were selected because their @xmath5 were also determined using computer simulations in a study by rautiainen et al .",
    "these authors used virtual particles to simulate the response of gas molecules in a gravitational potential for 38 barred spiral galaxies .",
    "ten of these galaxies were included in the efigi dataset .",
    "we applied the pd method to the ten common galaxies and found the results to be consistent with the values reported by rautiainen et al .",
    "the results for these 10 galaxies are shown in figure 5 .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the relative bar pattern speed of 9 of the 10 sample galaxies studied using the pd method are consistent ( within the 1-@xmath24 errors ) with the results obtained by the computer simulations of rautiainen et al .",
    "the galaxy without consistent results is pgc 35676 ( ngc 3726 ) .",
    "however the values for this galaxy with their uncertainties , @xmath25 for the pd method and @xmath26 using computer modeling , nearly overlap , and they definitely overlap within the 2-@xmath24 errors ( the quoted errors are 1-@xmath24 ) , so one could argue that , even for ngc 3726 , the bar pattern speed determined here , and that determined by rautiainen et al.(2008 ) , are consistent .",
    "note that in table 2 , we include the calculated pixel scale ( in @xmath17/pixel ) and the @xmath27 and @xmath16 in both pixels and arcseconds .",
    "since the relative bar pattern speed , @xmath5 , is a dimensionless parameter , the choice of units for @xmath27 and @xmath16 are not that important .",
    "we feel that this information is useful for readers who wish to use efigi data in the future .",
    "figure 5 shows a bar corotation radius for pgc 35676 at @xmath28 pixels , the first phase crossing after the end of the bar .",
    "if our identified bar length of @xmath29 pixels is multiplied by the relative bar pattern speed found using computer modeling , @xmath30 , the corotation radius , @xmath31 pixels .",
    "visual inspection of pgc 35676 in figure 5 shows another phase crossing at @xmath32 pixels .",
    "it is possible the pattern speed reported by rautiainen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) refers to a different corotation or resonance location .",
    "the potential - density phase - shift method uses near - infrared images to infer the gravitational potential and density of a galaxy .",
    "the potential and density spirals are azimuthally shifted from each other .",
    "the locations where the phase shift changes , signals a corotation radius . for an s - shaped spiral or bar ,",
    "the sign convention is to `` assume the phase shift is positive when the potential lags the density pattern in the direction of galactic rotation '' ( zhang & buta 2007 ; hereafter zb07 ) .    in buta & zhang ( 2009 ; hereafter bz09 ) , the corotation radii were determined using the potential - density phase - shift method .",
    "then , relative bar pattern speeds for 101 galaxies were calculated from their corotation radii , using the bar radii derived by laurikainen et al .",
    "the results include `` super - fast '' bars , i.e. , bars with @xmath33 ( bz09 ) .",
    "this is controversial as a bar with a pattern speed @xmath33 should not be self - consistent , and therefore , should not be long - lived ( contopoulos 1980 ) .",
    "we were able to determine corotation radii and relative bar pattern speeds for 17 of the galaxies from the bz09 sample ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this includes all ten of the galaxies from figure 5 that had measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath16 from the rautiainen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) study .",
    "generally , the results using the pd method are inconsistent with the zb07 method .",
    "however uncertainties were not included in the bz09 results .",
    "it is possible that a calculation of those uncertainties would show the two methods to actually be consistent with each other .",
    "additionally , because of the controversial `` super - fast '' bars derived from the method used by bz09 , their results are in conflict with the popular view of self - sustaining bars ( contopolous 1980 ) .",
    "the relative bar pattern speeds from bz09 are included in table 2 .",
    "figure 6 shows results from the pd method for the 7 galaxies that were not included the rautiainen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) method .",
    "figure 7 shows the phase crossings and information for which cr radii could be determined using the pd method for the 40 remaining galaxies .    within the quoted errors , all 57 of the galaxies in our sample have relative bar pattern speeds of @xmath34 or greater",
    "this is consistent with the results of contopoulos ( 1980 ) , who find that the radius of a bar can not be larger than its cr radius , or the bar would not be self sustaining ( i.e. , it would not exist ) .    as can be seen from the values of the relative bar pattern speed , @xmath5 , in both table 2 and figure 2 , 34 out of 57 galaxies have `` fast '' bars with @xmath35 . from the results of debattista & sellwood ( 2000 )",
    ", we would expect this to indicate that these galaxies have dark matter halos with a low navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) concentration parameter , @xmath36 .",
    "this is due to reduced dynamical friction between the bar and the halo .    in seeming contradiction to this conclusion ,",
    "athanassoula ( 2014 ) showed via @xmath37-body+sph simulation models that galaxies with submaximal disks have widely differing values of @xmath5 , ranging from fast to slow , when only slow bars are expected . from these results",
    ", she argues that @xmath5 does not indicate a constraint of the halo density .",
    "recently , sellwood & debattista ( 2014 ) have argued that athanassoula s simulations ( 2014 ) do in fact agree with the conclusion that maximum disks models have @xmath38 .",
    "her models with varied gas fractions , but similar mass distributions initially , should not all experience the same dynamical friction .",
    "instead , the rearrangement of mass in the early evolution of a galaxy makes gas - rich disks more maximal .",
    "this leads to less dynamical friction between the forming bar and the halo , giving a lower measured value of @xmath5 .",
    "the net result of these arguments allows us to conclude that low nfw concentrations exist in 34 out of 57 galaxies in our sample due to their fast bars .",
    "we have applied the photometric pd method for determining cr radii and relative bar pattern speeds to a sample of 57 galaxies . of these galaxies ,",
    "17 had cr radii that had been determined via other methods in the literature .",
    "for these 17 galaxies , we obtain results that are generally consistent with those found using the sticky - particle simulation method ( rautiainen et al .",
    "our results appear to be inconsistent with the more controversial phase density method used by bz09 .",
    "it should be noted that the phase density method is controversial , primarily because bz09 have used it to determine that some bars are `` super - fast '' , and ( as explained above ) , this should not be possible ( contopoulos 1980 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to find any galaxies in the efigi catalogue for which the bar pattern speed had been determined using the tw method . the tw method is generally considered the best approach for determining bar speeds , since it is the only method which measures bar speed directly . nevertheless , there is an indication that sticky - article modeling and tw measurements produce similar results within the errors ( treuthardt et al.2009 ) .",
    "our comparison of the pd method with the sticky - particle simulation ( rautiainen et al .",
    "2008 ) method shows very promising results .    using the dynamical results of debattista & sellwood ( 2000 )",
    ", we argue that most of the galaxies in our sample ( 34 out of 57 ) have `` fast '' bars .",
    "this would indicate a low nfw concentration .",
    "finally , our results have implications on models that explain the nature of spiral structure in disk galaxies .",
    "generally , resonances ( including the cr ) are expected from any type of spiral density wave .",
    "this could be a quasi - stationary density wave ( e.g. , lin & shu 1964 ; bertin et al .",
    "1989a , b ; bertin 1993 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) , or even swing amplification ( e.g. , toomre 1981 ; fuchs 2001 ) . however , the color gradients we find across spiral arms appear inconsistent with the predictions of manifold theory ( romero - gomez et al .  2006 , 2007 ;",
    "athanassoula et al .  2009a , b , 2010 ; athanassoula 2012 ) .",
    "in manifold theory , particles ( i.e. , gas or stars ) flow along the manifold ( the spiral arm ) , rather than across it .",
    "it is the flow of gas across a density wave that leads to the color changes we see across spiral arms .",
    "the color gradients we find in our sample of 57 galaxies , suggest that manifold theory is not in operation in these objects .",
    "it should be noted that the sample of 57 galaxies that we have studied here was drawn from a parent sample of 100 galaxies . in the parent sample",
    ", we found phase profiles for 18 galaxies that were erratic or noisy .",
    "as there was no clear phase crossing for these 18 objects , this could be evidence that supports manifold theory in these particular galaxies .",
    "we therefore suggest that , while density wave theories explain spiral structure in most disk galaxies , there are some that may be better explained with manifold theory .",
    "however , it is clear that larger datasets need to be studied in order to come to any solid conclusions .",

    "<S> in this paper , we apply a method identified by puerari & dottori to find the corotation radii ( cr ) in spiral galaxies . we apply our method to 57 galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> 17 of which have already have their cr locations determined using other methods . </S>",
    "<S> the method we adopted entails taking fourier transforms along radial cuts in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 wavebands and comparing the phase angles as a function of radius between them . </S>",
    "<S> the radius at which the phase angles cross indicates the location of the corotation radius . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculated the relative bar pattern speed , @xmath5 , and classified the bar as `` fast '' , where @xmath6 , slow , where @xmath7 , or intermediate , where the errors on @xmath5 are consistent with the bar being `` slow '' or `` fast '' . </S>",
    "<S> for the 17 galaxies that had their cr locations previously measured , we found that our results were consistent with the values of @xmath5 obtained by the computer simulations of rautiainen , salo & laurikainen . </S>",
    "<S> for the larger sample , our results indicate that 34 out of 57 galaxies ( @xmath860% ) have fast bars . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these results in the context of its implications for dark matter concentrations in disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss these results in the context of different models for spiral structure in disk galaxies .    </S>",
