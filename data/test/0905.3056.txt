    "neutrino mass generation in the standard model is likely to come from a basic dimension - five operator that violates lepton number  @xcite .",
    "little is known about the ultimate origin of this operator , including the nature of the underlying mechanism , its characteristic scale and/or flavor structure .",
    "correspondingly , it has many possible realizations involving the exchange of scalar and/or fermions at the tree and/or radiative level  @xcite .    in a broad class of models",
    "the exchange of heavy gauge singlet fermions induces neutrino masses via what is now called type - i seesaw  @xcite .",
    "an attractive mechanism called inverse seesaw has long been proposed as an alternative to the simplest type - i seesaw  @xcite ( for other extended seesaw schemes see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the left - handed sm neutrinos @xmath1 in the inverse seesaw model ones introduces two 21 singlets @xmath2 . in the basis",
    "@xmath3 the effective neutrino mass matrix is @xmath4 that can be simply justified by assuming a @xmath5 global lepton number symmetry .",
    "neutrinos get masses only when @xmath5 is broken .",
    "the latter can be arranged to take place at a low scale , for example through the @xmath6 mass term in the mass matrix given below , @xmath7 after @xmath5 breaking the effective light neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath8 so that , when @xmath9 is small , @xmath10 is also small , even when @xmath11 lies at the electroweak or tev scale . in other words ,",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses follows naturally since as @xmath12 the lepton number becomes a good symmetry  @xcite without need for superheavy physics .",
    "the smallness of the parameter @xmath9 may also arise dynamically in sypersymmetric models and/or spontaneously in a majoron - like scheme with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a 21 singlet @xcite . in the latter case , for sufficiently low values of @xmath15 there may be majoron emission effects in neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite .",
    "recently another alternative seesaw scheme called linear seesaw has been suggested from @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "here we consider a simpler variant of this model based just on the framework of the 21 gauge structure . in the basis @xmath3",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix is @xmath17 here the lepton number is broken by the @xmath18 term , and the effective light neutrino mass is given by @xmath19    in addition to indications of non - vanishing neutrino mass , neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite indicate a puzzling structure  @xcite of the elements of the lepton mixing matrix , at variance with the quark mixing angles .    in this paper",
    "we consider the possibility of predicting lepton mixing angles from first principles , in the framework of the inverse or linear seesaw mechanisms to generate light neutrino masses .",
    "an attractive phenomenological ansatz for leptons mixing  @xcite is the tribimaximal ( tbm ) one @xmath20 which is equivalent to the following values for the lepton mixing angles : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , providing a good first approximation to the values indicated by current neutrino oscillation data .    below we give two simple @xmath0 flavor symmetry realizations of the tbm lepton mixing pattern within the above seesaw schemes .",
    "for example , for the inverse seesaw case possible schemes are summarized in table  [ tab0 ] .",
    ".possible tbm inverse seesaw schemes . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the invariant lagrangian is @xmath24 where the couplings are given as in eq .",
    "( [ ass2 ] ) .",
    "after the scalar fields take vevs obeying the alignment conditions given in eqs.([phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) , the resulting yukawa couplings are given by ( [ ass2 ] ) and therefore the light neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by tbm in the basis where charged leptons are diagonal as explained above .",
    "the light neutrino eigenvalues are given by @xmath25",
    "above we have introduced two very simple models based respectively on inverse and linear seesaw mechanisms . due to the assumed flavor symmetry",
    "they are highly restrictive . by construction , the lepton mixing matrix in both models",
    "is predicted to be tribimaximal and neutrino phenomenology is effectively described by just three mass parameters and a phase .",
    "two of them are the neutrino squared - mass splittings well - determined in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the other mass parameter characterizes the absolute neutrino mass scale which will be probled in tritium and neutrinoless double beta decay searches , as well as cosmology .",
    "as we have noted already , there is no cp violation in neutrino oscillations , and only one majorana phase remains and affects the predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay ( see below ) .",
    "* neutrinoless double beta decay *    despite their similarity , one can distinguish these models phenomenologically since eqs([inv ] ) and ( [ lin ] ) give rise to different neutrino mass spectra and this implies different expectations for neutrinoless double beta decay , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbd ] ( similar predictions have been made within a4-symmetric type - i seesaw models , as shown , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .     as a function of the lightest neutrino mass for",
    "inverse seesaw ( red ) and linear seesaw ( blue ) .",
    "the cyan and purple bands represent respectively the generic regions allowed by current data with lepton mixing angles fixed to be the tri - bimaximal values . for references to experiments see @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0%,height=245 ]    one sees that , in contrast to the inverse seesaw , in the linear seesaw case there is a lower bound on the neutrinoless double beta decay rate despite the fact that we have a normal neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "in contrast , the effect of the majorana phase in the inverse seesaw can cause full cancellation in the decay rate .",
    "* lepton flavor violating decays *    in the inverse and linear seesaw models studied here , the neutrino mass matrix is a @xmath26 symmetric matrix , see eqs([minv ] ) and ( [ mlin ] ) .",
    "this is diagonalized by a corresponding unitary matrix @xmath27 of the same dimension , @xmath28 , leading to three light majorana eigenstates @xmath29 with @xmath30 and six heavy ones @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the effective charged current weak interaction is characterized by a rectangular lepton mixing matrix @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath30 denote the left - handed charged leptons and @xmath35 the neutrals .",
    "the contribution to the decay @xmath36 arises at one loop ( see for instance @xcite ) from the exchanges of the six heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath31 which couple subdominantly to the charged leptons .    the well - known one loop contribution to this branching ratio",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 we note that , thanks to the admixture of the tev states in the charged current weak interaction , this branching ratio can be sizeable even in the absence of supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "similar results hold for a class of lfv processes , including nuclear mu - e conversion  @xcite .",
    "as already noted , the rates for mu - e conversion and @xmath39 are strongly correlated in this model .",
    "these are the most stringently constrained lfv decays .",
    "the simplicity of their mass matrices , which are expressed in terms of very few parameters , makes the current models especially restrictive and this has an impact in the expected pattern of lfv decays .",
    "in contrast to the general case considered in @xcite , here we can easily display the dependence of the @xmath40 branching ratio on the new physics scale represented by the parameters @xmath41 tev and the parameters @xmath9 or @xmath42 characterizing the low - scale violation of lepton number , since both are simply proportional to the identity matrix in flavor space .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : megbr ] .     versus the lepton",
    "number violation scale : @xmath9 for the inverse seesaw ( red color ) , and @xmath42 for the linear seesaw ( blue color ) . in both cases",

    "this can be seen easily as follows .",
    "recall that we have only three mass parameters , two of which are determined by solar and atmospheric splittings , while the third is related to the overall scale of neutrino mass .",
    "the ratio @xmath47 is well determined by neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .    for the inverse seesaw case we have from eq.([eigiss ] )",
    "@xmath48 then @xmath49 where @xmath50 .    as mentioned ,",
    "the main contributions to the lfv processes are those involving the heavy singlet neutrinos",
    ". then the relevant elements of the lepton mixing matrix are @xmath51 , and as a result the @xmath52 matrix of eq .",
    "( [ def : g ] ) is characterized by only two parameters , @xmath53 and for inverse seesaw one finds : @xmath54 taking ratios of branching ratios , prefactors cancel and one finds , for example for @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the solution of the eq.([altin ] )    a similar procedure can be carried out for the linear seesaw , using eq.([eiglin ] ) for the light neutrino mass eigenvalues .",
    "one finds @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the solution of the equation @xmath59 as a result of eqs .",
    "( [ brin ] ) and ( [ brl ] ) we obtain the predictions illustrated in fig .",

    "given the current bounds on @xmath63 we have b(@xmath64 ) @xmath65 placing a tremendous challenge for the search for lepton flavor violating tau decays for testing the prediction given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    before closing this section",
    "let us also mention that the tev neutral heavy leptons are potentially accessible directly in accelerator experiments , see , for example , ref .",
    "the inverse and linear seesaw mechanisms provide very interesting alternative scenarios to the type - i seesaw since the scale of the new fermions leading to neutrino mass can lie at the tev scale , potentially accessible at the lhc . in this paper",
    "we have given two models based on the @xmath0 discrete flavor symmetry and realizing the successful tri - bimaximal ansatz for lepton mixing .",
    "we have introduced several higgs doublets transforming as triplet and singlet representations of @xmath0 .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath0 is spontaneously broken to @xmath66 in the charged lepton sector and into @xmath67 in the neutrino sector which yields the tbm lepton mixing pattern .",
    "both models are highly predictive as they effectively depend only on three mass parameters and one majorana phase , implying no cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "in contrast to the inverse seesaw , the linear seesaw leads to a lower bound for neutrinoless double beta decay .    among their other phenomenological features ,",
    "the mixing of heavy neutrinos in the charged electroweak current leads to various lepton flavor violating decays such as @xmath36 and @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast to standard type - i seesaw , here these rates can be sizeable even in the absence of supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , the tbm mixing pattern leads to specific predictions for lfv decays as illustrated , for example , in fig .",
    "however , within our particular @xmath0 symmetry realizations , the tbm pattern also implies that b(@xmath69 ) @xmath70 , well below current experimental sensitivities .    as a final comment ,",
    "we have only described in this paper results that follow from exact symmetry realizations of the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern .",
    "it is possible , however , that the symmetry leading to tbm holds only at some high unification scale and deviations are induced .",
    "possible radiative effects have been considered for example , in the framework of supergravity models in ref .",
    "for example , in the presence of supersymmetry , broken by soft breaking terms that do not respect our flavor symmetry , one would have potentially important corrections that might enhance tau - violating processes with respect to the predictions presented here . finally , let us also mention that , as already noted in @xcite generic inverse and linear seesaw models may be embedded in an @xmath16 framework .",
    "the non - abelian flavor structure may be incorporated in these models in order to generate the tbm pattern discussed here , along the lines considered in refs .",
