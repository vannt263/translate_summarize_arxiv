    "in previous papers ( kato 2004 , 2008a ) , we proposed a resonant excitation mechanism of disk oscillations in deformed disks .",
    "the purpose is to propose an excitation mechanism of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in neutron - star and black - hole x - ray binaries ( e.g. , kato and fukue 2007 , kato 2008b ) . in this resonant excitation model of disk oscillations ,",
    "a deformation of disks from an axially - symmetric equilibrium state is essential .",
    "the deformation to be considered is a warp or an eccentric deformation of disks in the equatorial plane .",
    "an outline of the model is as follows .",
    "a non - linear coupling between a disk oscillation ( hereafter we call it the original oscillation ) and a deformed part of the disks ( warp or eccentric deformation ) brings about some forced disk oscillations ( we call them intermediate oscillations ) .",
    "the intermediate oscillations make a resonant coupling with the unperturbed disk at particular radii of the disk . after this resonant coupling , the intermediate oscillations feedback to the original oscillation by a nonlinear coupling with the deformed part of the disk . since this nonlinear feedback process involves a resonance , the original oscillation is amplified or dampened .",
    "kato ( 2004 , 2008a ) examined this nonlinear feedback processes , and derived an excitation criterion and growth ( damping ) rate of the resonant oscillations .",
    "it is of importance to note that in keplerian disks this resonant excitation process works only when the disks are general relativistic .",
    "that is , a non - monotonic radial distribution of epicyclic frequency is necessary for appearance of resonance and for trapping of oscillations .    in these studies",
    "the intermediate disk oscillations were assumed to be local near to the resonant radius in the sense that their radial wavelength is shorter than the characteristic radial length of disks .",
    "that is , the radial derivative , @xmath0 , operated to the wave quantities was taken to be @xmath1 .",
    "further , @xmath2 was assumed to be constant .",
    "this treatment of @xmath3 const .",
    ", however , was inadequate around the resonant point .",
    "if this inadequate treatment is properly corrected , we find that unlike in the previous papers , the resonant point is not the place where a local dispersion relation of the intermediate oscillations is satisfied with a constant @xmath2 , but the radii of lindblad resonance for intermediate oscillations ( when resonance occurs by horizontal motions ) or the radii where the intermediate oscillations are trapped in the vertical direction ( when resonance occurs by vertical motions ) .    in this paper , we modify the analyses in our previous papers so that the above - mentioned inadequate treatment is corrected .",
    "we apply the mathematical techniques used by meyer - vernet and sicardy ( 1987 ) in their study of resonant disk - satellite interaction .",
    "the results show that the stability criterion derived in the previous papers are unchanged .",
    "the expression for growth rate obtained in the previous papers is found to be still applicable , but in this paper the expression is changed in a form more suitable to numerical calculations .",
    "we first summarize in section 2 the basic equations and relations necessary to the study of the present resonant excitation problem , although they are given in the previous papers . in section 3 ,",
    "the stability criterion and growth rate are derived to the case of pressure - less disks as it is instructive , and to the case of disks with pressure in section 4 .",
    "the final section is devoted to a brief discussion on a meaning of the instability criterion .",
    "we briefly summarize here basic equations and relations [ see kato ( 2008a ) for details ] that are necessary in the subsequent sections .      in the present problem ,",
    "the general relativity is essential . for simplicity ,",
    "however , formulation in this paper is done in the framework of a pseudo - newtonian using the gravitational potential introduced by paczy ' nski and wiita ( 1980 ) , assuming that the central object has no rotation .",

    "derivation of a detailed expression for @xmath16 is boring , because of the presence of many terms .",
    "however , after lengthy manipulations we can summarize them into a relatively simple form in the case of @xmath17 : @xmath18 using cartesican cordinates .",
    "when @xmath19 , some terms should be added on the right - hand side , which are shown in equation ( 82 ) of kato ( 2008a ) .",
    "an important characteristics of @xmath16 is that we have commutative relations ( kato 2008a ) for an arbitrary set of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 : @xmath23 as shown later , the presence of these commutative relations is the reason why we have a simple stability criterion . we suppose that this commutative relation is a general property of conservative systems .",
    "we now assume that the disks are deformed from an axisymmetric steady state by some external or internal cause .",
    "the deformation is assumed , for simplicity , to be time - independent , and has the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath24 .",
    "the lagrangian displacement associated with the deformation , @xmath25 , is denoted by , @xmath5 [ see equation ( [ wave ] ) ] , and @xmath26 [ see equation ( [ intermediate ] ) ] are expressed in complex forms .",

    "a plane - symmetric one - armed spiral deformation is one of another possible candidates that can excite disk oscillations . in both cases we have @xmath29 .",
    "our purpose here is to examine how the behavior of disk oscillations are affected by the disk deformation .",

    "in this paper we have derived a stability criterion on resonant excitation of disk oscillations in a deformed disk .",
    "deformation of disks that can lead to excitation of disk oscillations are a warp and an eccentric deformation of disk plane , i.e. , @xmath331 , although this is not discussed in this paper ( see kato 2004 , 2008a ) . in previous papers ( kato 2004 , 2008a ) , the above resonant excitation problem was examined and a condition of excitation of disk oscillations was derived . from mathematical point of view , however , the treatment of disk oscillations around the resonant point was not suitable in the previous papers . in this paper , we corrected the inadequate points .",
    "the results of the correction show that the stability condition and the growth rate derived in the previous papers are kept qualitatively unchanged . in this paper , however , the growth rate of oscillations is written in a form applicable more easily to numerical calculations of growth rate .    in disks with pressure ,",
    "the resonant region is widened by pressure effects . based on arguments by meyer - vernet and sicardy ( 1987 )",
    ", we showed in section 4 that the half - width of the resonant region is @xmath332 ( or @xmath333 ) , which is shorter than @xmath69 but longer than @xmath77 .",
    "the coupling terms comes from nonlinear products of original oscillation , @xmath334 , and disk deformation , @xmath335 .",
    "if the disk deformation is assumed to be global , the scale of spatial variation of the coupling terms is mainly governed by the spatial behavior of the original oscillation , @xmath334 .",
    "hence , in general , the width of resonant region is comparable with the wavelength of the original oscillations and may not be narrow enough to regard the coupling terms @xmath125 s as constant in the region .",
    "hence , in section 4 , we examined two limiting cases where i ) the coupling terms are constant in the resonant region and ii ) they vary sinusoidally in the region . analyses in section 4",
    "show that in these two limiting cases there are no essential differences in growth rate , especially no difference in the criterion of stability . to examine what happens in intermediate cases of the above two limiting ones ,",
    "however , numerical calculations will be needed .",
    "it is noted that the case where the coupling terms , @xmath203 , are roughly constant in the resonant region is realized when resonance occurs near to the boundary between the propagation and evanescent regions of the the original oscillations .",
    "this is because near to the boundary , the radial wavelength of the oscillations is long .",
    "applications of the present disk oscillation model to high - frequency qpos by kato and fukue ( 2006 ) and kato ( 2008a ) are concerned in such cases .",
    "the another limiting case where the coupling terms vary in the radial direction will be realized when resonance occurs in the propagation region far apart from the boundary between the propagation and evanescent regions .",
    "there are two kinds of resonances , i.e. , horizontal and vertical resonances . in both resonances ,",
    "the condition of excitation of oscillations is that the wave energy of the original oscillation , @xmath146 , and @xmath178 at the resonant radius have the opposite signs , i.e. , @xmath336 . for the resonance to occur efficiently",
    ", the resonant radius must be within the region where both original and intermediate oscillations exists predominantly .",
    "hence , it will be reasonable to suppose that the sign of @xmath177 roughly represents the sign of the energy of the intermediate oscillation .",
    "[ notice that the sign of wave energy of the intermediate oscillation is determined by the sign of @xmath178 in the region where the wave exists predominantly , see equations ( [ 5.28 ] ) and ( [ 5.29 ] ) ] . in other words , the condition of @xmath337 is roughly equal to the condition that the original and intermediate oscillations have energies of the opposite signs .",
    "this instability criterion thus can be understand as a result of energy exchange between the original and intermediate oscillations at the resonant point ( ferreira and ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "the resonant instability condition , i.e. , @xmath338 , however , is not exactly equal to the condition of both oscillaions ( original and intermediate one ) having the opposite signs .",
    "this suggests that the energy exchange at the resonant point is not only between the above two oscillations , but the disk rotation also plays a part and gains or losses its energy . in the case of @xmath339 , the original oscillation is damped . roughly speaking ,",
    "in this case , both oscillations ( original and intermediate ones ) have the same signs in their wave energy .",
    "hence , in this case , the main energy flow will be between disk rotation and the oscillations so that the oscillations are damped .",
    "it is noticed that in vertical resonance we always have @xmath339 in the case where a resonant radius can appear in disk plane and the oscillations are always damped ( see kato 2004 , 2008a ) .",
    "finally , it is noted that the present resonant excitation mechanism has been applied to quasi - periodic oscillations observed in black - hole and neutron - star x - ray binaries , for example , by kato and fukue ( 2006 ) , kato ( 2008a ) and kato et al ."
