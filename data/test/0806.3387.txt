    "in recent years the spin - boson model @xcite ",
    "@xcite has experienced a strong revival , as it is well suited to describe dissipative and decoherence effects on the dynamics of a two - level system ( tls ) or qubit coupled to a bath .",
    "crucial for the effects of the environment on the dynamics of the tls is the shape of the spectral density of the harmonic bath .",
    "it is common to assume an ohmic spectral density , which is linear in the continuous bath modes . in this work we concentrate on a so - called structured bath ,",
    "for which the spectral density is ohmic at low frequencies but exhibits a lorenztian - shaped peak at a certain frequency @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a spin - boson model with such an effective spectral density can be exactly mapped on the model of a tls which is coupled to a single harmonic oscillator ( ho ) of frequency @xmath0 , where the latter feels the influence of an ohmic bath.due to its wide applicability the tls - oscillator system has been object of intense research along the years .",
    "so it reflects for example the physics of single atoms with a large electric dipole moment coupled to the microwave photons of a cavity @xcite , or quantum dots in photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "more recently the model has received quite some attention in the field of quantum computation , where two - level systems are used to implement the two logical states of a qubit .",
    "we will especially focus on the solid - state implementation of such systems . here , two prominent realizations of a qubit - oscillator system are the cooper - pair box ( cpb ) @xcite  @xcite coupled to a transmission line resonantor @xcite  @xcite and the josephson flux qubit @xcite read out by a dc - squid @xcite  @xcite .",
    "inspired by experiments with real atoms interacting with a cavity mode , one speaks for the cpb case of circuit quantum electrodynamics , as now the cpb plays the role of an artificial atom and the waveguide acts as a cavity . from such a setup one expects a huge step towards the realization of a quantum computer , as the transmission line resonator can be used to couple qubits together @xcite , store the information of qubits or to provide non - demolition read - out schemes @xcite . concerning the flux qubit",
    ", the read - out usually happens through a damped dc - squid , which is inductively coupled to the qubit .",
    "however , through the squid enviromental noise is transferred to the qubit leading to decoherence and dissipation within its dynamics .",
    "the effect of this noise on the qubit depends very much on the strength @xmath1 of the coupling between qubit and squid and one faces a conflicting situation . on the one hand one",
    "wants a strong coupling for a good read - out resolution . on the other hand",
    "the coupling should be minimized to keep the negative effects of the environment as small as possible . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the qubit - squid system can be described by a spin - boson model with an effective spectral density @xmath2 exhibting a peak at the plasma frequency @xmath0 of the squid . applying the above mentioned mapping an equivalent point of view",
    "is to consider the squid as an lc - circuit coupled to the ohmic bath and model it as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "a detailed description of a nondestructive read - out scheme is e.g. given in @xcite .",
    "the spin - boson model can be formally solved using e.g. real - time path integral methods @xcite . however , in order to get closed - form analytical results , approximations must be invoked .",
    "a quite common one is the so - called weak coupling approximation ( wca ) , which is perturbative in the bath spectral density @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that for strong qubit - ho coupling @xmath1 and for small detuning @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the qubit energy splitting , such an approximation breaks down @xcite , as coherent exchange processes between tls and oscillator are disregared .",
    "for an unbiased qubit the non - interacting blip approximation ( niba ) used in @xcite @xcite circumvents this problem as it is non - perturbative in the coupling @xmath1 and therefore takes correctly into account the influence of the oscillator on the tls .",
    "moreover , it allows an analytic treatment of the dynamics .",
    "however , the niba is known to break down for a biased qubit at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "another approach , which treats the system non - perturbatively in the bath is the flow - equation renormalization method @xcite , where the spin - boson hamiltonian is diagonalized using infinitesimal unitary transformations .",
    "however , whithin this approach analytical solutions are difficult to find .",
    "recently a polaron transformation was used by huang to obtain analytically the population dynamics and confirm the shiba s relation for an unbiased tls @xcite.in the case in which the qubit and the ho are considered as the central quantum system being coupled to an ohmic bath , the numerical , ab - initio quasiadiabatic propagator path - integral ( quapi ) method @xcite is a nice tool as it enables to cover both the resonant regime , where the oscillator frequency is close to the qubit energy splitting , and the dispersive regime with the oscillator being far detuned from the qubit @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be applied to a biased as well as to an unbiased tls and therefore be used as a testbed for analytical results . for qubits",
    "being operated at the degeneracy point , which means an unbiased tls , very often a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is applied @xcite , which is expected to be valid for small detuning and yields as starting point the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this model was first used to study a two - state atom interacting with a single , close to resonance cavity mode of the electromagnetic field and predicts e.g. the repeated revival and collapse of rabi oscillations within the atomic excitation probability . by condsidering the tls - ho system in the representation of displaced ho states , brito were able to truncate the infinite hilbert space of this system without loosing the effects of the ho on the tls dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , so far none of these works could provide an analytical expression for the dynamics of the dissipative qubit being valid for zero as well as non - zero detuning and for both a biased and unbiased tls . in this work an analytic expression for the dissipative qubit s dynamics which includes the effects of a finite detuning and of a static bias is derived . specifically , starting from the qubit - ho perspective , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the non - dissipative tls - ho system are found approximately using van - vleck perturbation theory up to second order in the coupling @xmath1 .",
    "notice that no rotating wave approximation is required .",
    "dissipation effects are then evaluated by solving a born - markov master equation for the reduced density matrix in the system s eigenbasis .",
    "the structure of the work is as follows .",
    "the dissipative tls - ho hamiltonian and the main dynamical quantities are introduced in . inspired by the work of goorden @xcite , we demonstrate in how the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the non - dissipative hamiltonian can be found approximately using van - vleck perturbation theory @xcite . in this way we can provide an analytical formula for the non - dissipative dynamics whichs takes into account the full hilbert space of the qubit - ho system . after that , we show how for low temperatures ( @xmath5 ) this infinite hilbert space can be truncated and discuss the relevant contributions of the ho to the dynamics . in the influence of the environment",
    "is investigated , by looking at solutions of the bloch - redfield equations .",
    "specifically , analytical expressions fo the tls dynamics are obtained and compared with numerical solutions .",
    "the main physical features of the coupled tls - ho system are discussed in . to illustrate the effects of counter - rotating terms in the hamiltonian of the qubit - ho system , which are neglected performing a rwa",
    ", we compare in our calculations to results obtained from the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "in this section we introduce the hamiltonian for a qubit coupled through a harmonic oscillator to a thermal bath . further , a formula for the population difference between the qubit s two logical states is derived .      to set up the model we consider the hamiltonian of a qubit - ho system , @xmath6 , which is coupled to an environmental bath , @xmath7 , by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 , so that the total hamiltonian becomes @xmath9 the hamiltonian , @xmath10 consists of @xmath11 the hamiltonian of the tls / qubit and the harmonic oscillator , and the interaction term @xmath12 the hamiltonian of the tls",
    "is given in the subspace @xmath13 , corresponding to a clockwise or counterclockwise current in the superconducting loop of a three - junction josephson qubit or more generally to the qubit s two logical states . in the case of a superconducting flux - qubit ,",
    "the energy bias @xmath14 can be tuned by an applied external flux , @xmath15 , and is zero at the so - called degeneracy point .",
    "the tunnelling amplitude is described by @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    "the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 are eigenstates of @xmath20 , whereas at the degeneracy point those eigenstates are a symmetric and antisymmetric superposition of the two logical states .",
    "further , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the annihilation and creation operator for the ho with frequency @xmath0 , and @xmath1 characterizes the coupling strength .",
    "we also introduce the energy splitting @xmath23 between the groundstate @xmath24 and the excited state @xmath25 of the tls . using the transformation @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ", we obtain the hamiltonian of the tls in the this basis : @xmath29 .",
    "the states @xmath19 and @xmath18 become in the energy basis @xmath30 the hamiltonian @xmath31 is diagonal in the eigenbasis @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the occupation number : @xmath34 . for the eigenbasis of the combined hamiltonian @xmath35 we write",
    "@xmath36 following caldeira and leggett @xcite , we model the environmental influences originating from the circuitry surrounding the qubit and the oscillator as a bath of harmonic oscillators being coupled bilinearly to the ho .",
    "thus , the environment is described by @xmath37 and the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath38 the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the creation and destruction operator , respectively , for the @xmath41 bath oscillator , @xmath42 is its frequency and @xmath43 gives the coupling strength .",
    "the whole bath can be described by its spectral density , which we consider to be ohmic : @xmath44 in @xcite it is shown that the above model is equivalent to that of a tls being coupled directly to a harmonic bath including the single oscillator of frequency @xmath0 ; i.e. , a spin - boson model @xcite with a peaked effective spectral density , @xmath45 the relation between @xmath46 and the coupling parameter @xmath1 between the qubit and the ho is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this second perspective is suitable for calculating the dynamics of the qubit using a path - integral approach , as it was done for example in @xcite for the case of an unbiased qubit ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the approach in @xcite , however , being based on the niba @xcite , is not suitable to investigate the low temperature dynamics of a biased tls .",
    "thus , in this manuscript we will consider the tls and the single oscillator as central quantum system and solve the bloch - redfield master equations for the density matrix of this system , which are valid also for the case of a biased tls .",
    "the main goal of this work is to determine the dynamics @xmath49 of the qubit .",
    "that means , we wish to calculate the population difference @xmath50 between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states of the qubit .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the tls , @xmath53 is found after tracing out the oscillator and bath degrees of freedom from the total density matrix @xmath54 . in turn",
    "@xmath55 is the reduced density matrix of the qubit - ho system .",
    "how to calculate this density matrix will be shown later .",
    "after some algebra , illustrated in more detail in [ apppt ] , we arrive at an expression for @xmath49 , given in terms of diagonal and off - diagonal elements of @xmath56 in the tls - ho eigenbasis @xmath57 .",
    "it reads @xmath58 where @xmath59   + 2 \\sin \\theta { \\langle j { \\rm g}|n\\rangle } { \\langle j { \\rm e}|n\\rangle } \\right\\ } \\rho_{n n}(t ) \\label{p0},\\\\    \\fl p_{nm}(t ) = 2 \\sum_j \\biggl\\ { \\cos \\theta \\biggl[{\\langle j { \\rm g}|n\\rangle } { \\langle m|j { \\rm g}\\rangle } - { \\langle j { \\rm e}|n\\rangle } { \\langle m|j { \\rm e}\\rangle }     \\biggr ] \\nonumber\\\\       + \\sin \\theta \\biggl[{\\langle j { \\rm e}|n\\rangle } { \\langle m|j { \\rm g}\\rangle } + { \\langle j { \\rm e}|m\\rangle } { \\langle n|j { \\rm g}\\rangle }     \\biggr ] \\biggr\\ } \\re \\ { \\rho_{nm}(t ) \\ } \\label{pnm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 . how to determine the eigenstates of @xmath6 is described in the next section .",
    "in this section we show how to find the eigenvalues of the unperturbed qubit - ho hamiltonian @xmath6 approximately by using van - vleck perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the idea is to take advantage of the degenerate or doublet structure of the energy spectrum of the uncoupled ( @xmath61 ) tls - ho system near resonance , e.g. at @xmath62 .",
    "then , as long as the perturbation is small compared to the energy separation of the different doublets , the full hamiltonian will exhibit a similar spectrum of bundled energy levels .",
    "the eigenenergies of the uncoupled tls - ho system are immediately found by applying the hamiltonian @xmath63 on the eigenstates in : @xmath64 the dashed lines in show the energy spectrum corresponding to vs. the oscillator frequency @xmath0 for the five lowest eigenstates . except for",
    "the groundstate , @xmath65 , the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 are degenerate in the resonant case @xmath68 .",
    "close to resonance the spectrum exhibits a doublet structure . with the coupling",
    "being switched on , the full hamiltonian @xmath69 reads @xmath70 in the basis @xmath71 . in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath72 we consider @xmath73 as a small perturbation , which is resonable as long as @xmath74 . applying van - vleck perturbation theory we construct an effective hamiltonian , @xmath75 having the same eigenvalues as @xmath76 but no matrix elements connecting states which are far off from degeneracy . thus , @xmath77 will be block - diagonal with all quasi - degenerate energy levels being in one common block . as in our case",
    "always two states are nearly degenerate , each block of @xmath78 builds a two - by - two matrix .",
    "this can be easily diagonalized in order to determine the eigenstates .",
    "following @xcite we calculate the transformation matrix @xmath79 up to second order in @xmath1 .",
    "the general formulas for both an arbitrary hamiltonian and @xmath76 are given in [ appvanvleck ] .",
    "the only surviving matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian , apart from the ones being of zeroth order in @xmath1 , are @xmath80 and @xmath81 . \\label{heff2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath82 has the matrix structure @xmath83 where the section shown corresponds to the basis states @xmath84 and @xmath85 . from this form",
    "it is easy to calculate the eigenstates and eigenenergies .",
    "the groundstate @xmath86 , which is an eigenstate of @xmath87 , has the eigenenergy @xmath88 the other eigenstates of @xmath87 are , @xmath89 , @xmath90 corresponding to the eigenenergies @xmath91\\\\                               = \\hbar \\left [ ( j+\\frac{1}{2 } ) \\omega + w_1 + w_0 \\mp   \\frac{1}{2 } \\sqrt{\\delta_j^2 + 4(j+1 ) |\\delta|^2 } \\right ] , } \\ ] ] @xmath92 by construction these are also eigenenergies of @xmath93 . using the transformation ( [ vanvlecktrafo ] ) we get the eigenvectors of @xmath93 as @xmath94 the energy spectrum of @xmath93 is shown in for the case of an unbiased tls ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "we want to emphasize that our findings are also valid for the more general case @xmath96 . at resonance , where the spectrum for the uncoupled case is degenerated ,",
    "avoided crossings can be seen .",
    "the gap between two formerly degenerated levels for @xmath97 is @xmath98 which is as predicted by the jaynes - cumming model @xcite .    as we will show in ,",
    "the second order correction @xmath99 in , whichleads to a shift in the resonance frequency , is a result of the counter - rotating terms in @xmath93 .",
    "as such it can be interpreted as a bloch - siegert shift @xcite .      with the coupling to the bath being turned off ,",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix of the qubit - ho system is given by @xmath100 and consequently @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "with that becomes @xmath103 where we defined @xmath104 . from we notice that the dynamics of the qubit is characterized by an infinite number of oscillation frequencies rather than showing rabi oscillations with a single distinct frequency .",
    "this is clearly a consequence of the coupling of the ho to the tls .",
    "further we assume that at @xmath105 the qubit starts in the state @xmath51 and that the occupation numbers of the ho are boltzmann distributed , so that @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the partition function of the oscillator and @xmath108 denotes the inverse temperature of the system . in the tls - ho eigenbasis",
    "this becomes @xmath109\\\\                \\times   \\left [ \\cos \\left ( \\frac{\\theta}{2 } \\right ) { \\langle j{\\rm g}|m\\rangle } + \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\theta}{2 } \\right ) { \\langle j { \\rm e}|m\\rangle } \\right].}\\ ] ]      with we found a formula which describes using the approximate eigenenergies and eigenstates in and the non - dissipative dynamics up to second order in @xmath1 , thereby taking into account all oscillator levels .",
    "thus , we still have to deal with an infinite hilbert space .",
    "typically experiments , see e.g. in @xcite , run in a temperature regime for which @xmath110 . considering the exponential function in we assume the higher oscillator levels to be only sparsely populated and the maximum value of the sum in is truncated to @xmath111 . nevertheless , states @xmath112 with @xmath113 still play a role in the dynamics . in fact , due to the van - vleck transformation @xmath114 , for example the state @xmath115\\ ] ] yields nonvanishing contributions to the matrix elements @xmath116 and @xmath117 occurring in due to the fact that the energy eigenstates of the coupled tls - ho system are made of linear combinations which involve also these states .",
    "using together with one finds that coefficients @xmath118 with @xmath119 are of higher than second order in @xmath1 .",
    "the same is valid for @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "thus , those terms play no role in our calculation of @xmath49 . furthermore",
    ", @xmath124 neglecting also these contributions we find that @xmath125 for @xmath126 . in the end it will be sufficient to concentrate on eigenstates of @xmath93 up to @xmath127 .",
    "this trunctation leaves us with ten possible oscillation frequencies @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    as an example",
    "we calculate the dynamics of an unbiased tls ( @xmath95 ) . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 vanish due to symmetry , so that @xmath136 additionally as a benchmark we consider the mostly studied resonant case , where @xmath137 .",
    "in this case we find with the transitions frequencies @xmath138 the dynamical quantity @xmath49 and its fourier transform are shown in .",
    "one clearly sees the influence of the coupling to the ho on the dynamics of the tls . instead of rabi oscillations with a single frequency",
    ", @xmath49 oscillates with six different frequencies , which are in the fourier spectrum symmetrically located around the point @xmath139 . among those frequencies @xmath140 and @xmath141 are dominating .",
    "they correspond to transitions between the first or second energy level of the qubit - ho system and its groundstate and their weight is almost equal . to summarize , one notices that due to the coupling with the oscillator additional frequencies are induced into the qubit dynamics .",
    "theoretically , the number of those frequencies is infinite . at low temperatures , however , transitions between the lower energy levels of the system are clearly dominating . again , for simplicity we have shown here the case of an unbiased tls . for @xmath96",
    "the behaviour is similar only that in the fourier spectrum the weight difference of the two dominating peaks will be more pronounced .",
    "in the preceding section we neglected the influence of the bath on the qubit - ho system . yet , in order to model a realistic situation , we have to pay attention to environmental influences , as they lead to decoherence and dissipation in the dynamics of the qubit , which is harmful for quantum computing application .",
    "thus , we will now consider the full hamiltonian @xmath142 .",
    "as shown in , we need for the calculation of the population difference @xmath49 the density matrix @xmath56 of the qubit - ho system . starting from the liouville equation of motion for the full density matrix @xmath143 of @xmath142 , @xmath144,\\ ] ] where the index stands for the interaction picture and following @xcite",

    "first , we consider our system and the bath to be initially ( at @xmath105 ) uncorrelated ; i.e. , @xmath149 with @xmath150 and @xmath151 the partition function of the bath .",
    "further , with the bath consisting of infinite degrees of freedom , we assume the effects of the interaction with the qubit - ho system to dissipate away quickly , such that the bath remains in thermal equilibrium for all times @xmath152 : @xmath153 besides , an initial slip term which occurs due to the sudden coupling of the system to the bath is neglected @xcite . and",
    "as last approximation the lamb - shift of the oscillation frequencies @xmath128 was not taken into account @xcite .      in @xmath154 describes matrix elements of the operator @xmath155 in the qubit - ho eigenbasis . by use of , and those states were expressed in the basis @xmath156 , and we will also calculate the oscillator matrix elements in this basis . for that purpose the operator @xmath157 is defined .",
    "four different situations can be distinguished .",
    "there are matrix elements were neither the oscillator nor the qubit state are changed , namely @xmath158 and @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "we see that those elements are independent of @xmath161 , the occupation number of the oscillator .",
    "next , we look at the case where a single quantum is emitted or absorbed from the oscillator and get @xmath162 and @xmath163 with @xmath164 for a transition within the qubit we have @xmath165 . and finally , if the qubit and the oscillator state are changed simultaneously , one obtains @xmath166 and @xmath167 , @xmath168 comparing the magnitude of the transition terms , we notice that those consisting in changes of the oscillator occupation only are the dominant ones , as they have a part which is of zeroth order in @xmath1 . further , for the case in which the qubit is operated at the degeneracy point @xmath169 and @xmath170 vanish . with those results we can calculate the matrix elements @xmath154 .",
    "they are given in [ apposcillatormatrixelements ] .",
    "like in we assume the system to be operated at low temperatures and thus take as highest qubit - ho state the eigenstate @xmath127 . for determination of @xmath49 the formulas of can be used .",
    "unlike in the non - dissipative case @xmath56 is not given anymore by the simple expression .",
    "rather we have to solve a system of coupled differential equations , namely . to do this analytically we will follow three different approaches and compare them finally to the numerical solution of .",
    "we start by introducing @xmath171 which yields the set of differential equations for @xmath172 @xmath173      as a first approach we make the full secular approximation ; i.e. , we neglect fast rotating terms in and keep only contributions where @xmath174 vanishes . in this way the off - diagonal elements of @xmath175 are decoupled from the diagonal ones so that @xmath176 the equation for the off - diagonal elements is then @xmath177 which becomes with @xmath178 as through the fsa the oscillatory motion of the dynamics is separated from the relaxation one we can divide into two parts , @xmath179 where @xmath180 describes the relaxation and @xmath181 the dephasing parts of the dynamics . with the latter takes the form @xmath182 with the dephasing rates @xmath183 .",
    "expressions for the dephasing coefficients @xmath184 can be found in [ ratecoeff ] and the initial conditions @xmath185 are given by .",
    "the diagonal elements are more difficult to obtain , as one has to solve a system of coupled differential equations , . calculating the corresponding rate coefficients of this system for the five lowest eigenstates ,",
    "we find that there are only eight independent ones , namely @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "they are given by @xmath194 where @xmath161 and @xmath195 adopt the above values .",

    "the remaining rate coefficients are combinations of the above .",

    "@xmath251 and @xmath252 are a mixture of contributions decaying with @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "similar to our findings for the relaxation rate , also here the smallest eigenvalue will dominate the dephasing behaviour . from the right graph in",
    "we find that this is @xmath255 .",
    "comparing it with the dephasing rates we got using the fsa , left graph in , we see that for negative detuning ( @xmath256 ) the rate @xmath257 approximates @xmath258 , whereas for positive detuning ( @xmath259 ) this is done by @xmath260 . in the fsa @xmath261 and",
    "@xmath262 correspond to the frequencies @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively . in the psa",
    "the frequency @xmath263 is given by @xmath264 for @xmath256 and @xmath265 for @xmath259 .",
    "hence , for negative detuning oscillations with frequency @xmath141 will dominate the dynamics , while those with @xmath140 will almost vanish . for positive detuning",
    "it is the other way round . in and",
    "this behaviour is reflected by the coefficients @xmath266 and @xmath267 . around resonance ( @xmath268 )",
    "the psa tells us by and that the dephasing rates and frequencies are a mixture of @xmath262 and @xmath261 or @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively . from the left graph in one",
    "notices further that the fsa rate @xmath261 grows linearly with @xmath0 for positive detuning .",
    "however , as the weight of the corresponding frequency @xmath141 will be almost zero , @xmath261 will give no relevant contribution to @xmath269 in this regime but the dephasing will rather be associated to the fsa rate @xmath262 .",
    "hence , out of resonance the fsa will still fairly well describe the dynamics of @xmath49 . comparing the expressions for @xmath270 and @xmath271 given in [ ratecoeff ] by and with the approximative expressions for the relaxation rate at positive and negative detuning",
    ", we see that for zero bias ( @xmath272 ) the psa dephasing rate is equal to @xmath273 . for a biased system an additional term",
    "is added depending on the spectral density of the bath at @xmath274 .",
    "in we compare the three analytical solutions described above to the numerical solution of the master equation for the case of an unbiased tls being at resonance with the oscillator . concerning both the dynamics of @xmath49 and its fourier spectrum we see a good agreement between the different solutions .",
    "the one being closest to the numerical solution is the psa solution .",
    "we also want to mention that going to stronger damping @xmath275 , the fsa results start to show deviations from the numerical solution . here , one should use the psa only .",
    "however , for the parameter regime used in the following , we will mainly apply due to its simple , analytical form .",
    "having solved the master equation analytically and numerically we can examine the dynamics of the system and its fourier transform for different situations .",
    "first , we will look at a qubit operated at the degeneracy point ( @xmath48 ) being in and out of resonance with the oscillator .",
    "then , we will concentrate on the biased qubit in the same regime of parameters .      for unbiased qubits",
    "we can compare our predictions with the analytical results obtained in @xcite by starting from a spin - boson model with the effective spectral density . in @xcite",
    "a so - called weak damping approximation ( wda ) based on the non - interacting blip approximation ( niba ) is applied .",
    "the wda allows a non - perturbative treatment of the coupling between the tls and ho and hence can reproduce the occurence of two dominating frequencies as expected e.g. from exact quapi calculations @xcite .",
    "the niba , and hence the wda , however , become not reliable for a biased tls .",
    "we find that the overall agreement between our approach and the wda is very good .",
    "however , in the wda solution the frequencies are slightly shifted compared to the ones obtained from our master equation .",
    "this may result from the perturbative expansion we have performed with respect to @xmath1 by applying the van - vleck perturbation theory .",
    "first , we look at the resonant case shown in .    in agreement with previous works @xcite , we find that the dynamics is dominated by two frequencies corresponding to @xmath140 and @xmath141 with separation being approximately @xmath276 .",
    "the weight of the latter is a bit larger .",
    "the reason for the bigger weight is that at resonance ( @xmath222 ) the qubit - ho eigenstate @xmath277 is not a symmetric superposition of the states @xmath278 and @xmath279 unlike it is predicted by the janyes - cummings model ( cf e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that the two unequal peaks have indeed been experimentally observed in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "4b therein ) . considering the states",
    "@xmath280 and @xmath281 in and , one already sees that for a symmetric superposition of these states we need that @xmath282 vanishes or that @xmath283^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] ( cf . ) . besides , in order to get the qubit - ho eigenstates one still has to perform the van - vleck transformation , which adds contributions to @xmath216 and @xmath217 from states corresponding to oscillator levels higher than @xmath111 .",
    "thus , our system behaves for @xmath284 as being negatively detuned , which means that the peak belonging to the higher frequency dominates , as we will show below .",
    "slightly increasing @xmath0 will give a stronger weight to the peak at @xmath140 .",
    "this effect is not very pronounced for the non - dissipative dynamics of the unbiased qubit ( ) , as there the two frequencies are still almost equally weighted .",
    "looking however at the fourier transform of the dissipative dynamics , one notices that the relaxation rate also contributes to the weight of the peaks with a prefactor @xmath285 . as for a negative detuned system",
    "@xmath262 is slightly bigger than @xmath261 , the difference between the two peaks becomes more clear in the dissipative case . for @xmath96 the effect can already be noticed in the non - dissipative case.next , we consider in the case of negative detuning , where @xmath286 .",
    "no matter which approach one is looking at , clearly the frequency @xmath141 is dominating .",
    "furthermore , paying attention to the timescale of the dynamics , one notices that the relaxation time is _ enhanced _ compared to the one we found for the resonant system .",
    "this behaviour was already explained by the formula for the relaxation rate .",
    "again , the numerical and the solution obtained by using the long - time ansatz in agree quite well with each other , whereas the amplitude of the oscillation with frequency @xmath141 is stronger in the wda approach .    also remarkable is the fact that looking at the fourier transform in one sees in the inset already small contributions of the higher oscillator levels .",
    "the transitions corresponding to @xmath287 and @xmath288 give raise to small additional peaks , while the contributions of @xmath289 and @xmath290 are negatively weighted and cause dips .",
    "the wda approach does not show this additional contributions .",
    "they are , however , confirmed by the numerical quapi calculations in @xcite ( see figure 2 therein ) .    in the case of positive detuning ( @xmath291 ) shown in",
    "we find a quite good agreement between all three approaches . also for postive detuning the relaxation time is enhanced compared to the resonant case .",
    "contrary to the negatively detuned situation the additional peaks have vanished .",
    "besides , now the frequency @xmath140 is dominating the dynamics .",
    "this behaviour , namely that for negative detuning @xmath141 and for positive detuning @xmath140 is dominating , was already found in @xcite .",
    "we will briefly explain how one can explain this observation physically .    for this",
    "we look at . for a detuned system ( @xmath292 ) the qubit - ho eigenstates are not symmetric superpositions of the states @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "they rather asymptotically approach the eigenstates of the uncoupled qubit - ho hamiltonian . in",
    "we see that for a negatively detuned system ( line a ) the qubit - ho eigenstate @xmath295 approaches the state @xmath296 , whereas the main contribution to the state @xmath297 will come from the state @xmath298 . from the left diagram in",
    "we see that the state @xmath217 is energetically higher than the state @xmath216 . however , due to the boltzmann distributed occupation of the oscillator , the state @xmath299 will be more populated than the state @xmath300 and consequently also @xmath217 will exhibit a larger population than @xmath216 , as the latter only feels a small contribution from the state @xmath299 .",
    "thus , transitions from @xmath217 to the groundstate are more likely to occur than those from @xmath216 to the groundstate .",
    "this explains the dominance of @xmath141 in and . in this case",
    "the frequency @xmath301 and @xmath302 . as far as not excluded by selection rules , minor peaks from transitions to the levels lying in between can be also seen.for positive detuning ( line c in ) @xmath295 approaches @xmath298 , while @xmath297 is close to @xmath296 . from the right graph in",
    "we see that the state @xmath216 , being lowest in energy apart from the groundstate , is now also more probable to be occupied than @xmath217 . therefore , as confirmed by and , the frequency @xmath140 is dominating whereas @xmath141 is represented only by a small peak in the fourier spectrum",
    ". furthermore , as there are no additional energy levels between the state @xmath216 , which is most probably to be populated , and the ground level , other transitions than those corresponding to @xmath140 or @xmath141 are very unlikely to occur . in the dip corresponding to @xmath303 appears only very faintly .",
    "we will now examine a qubit being operated at finite bias .",
    "we consider the case @xmath304 . for negative",
    "bias - offset the behaviour is analogous .",
    "again three different situations are taken into account : the qubit being in resonance with the oscillator ( @xmath305 ) , negative ( @xmath306 ) and positive ( @xmath307 ) detuning.for the resonant case ( @xmath222 ) depicted in we see a similiar behaviour as for the unbiased qubit . again",
    "two frequencies , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , are dominating the dynamics .",
    "left to the peak at @xmath140 a small dip can be found in the fourier spectrum .",
    "this corresponds to the transition @xmath303 .",
    "for infinite time the dynamics relaxes to an equilibrium value which is nonzero in contrast to the unbiased case .",
    "this can be seen in the fourier spectrum through a relaxation peak at @xmath308 .",
    "the peak arises because of the term @xmath309 in .",
    "the first part of this sum gives rise to the negative shift of this peak .",
    "the reason that for the analytical solution the peak is not as strongly shifted as for the numerical one is technical : in order to plot the delta function in we gave it a finite width , which surpresses the negative contribution of the first term in . like for the unbiased qubit",
    "the highest energy level playing a role for the dynamics is @xmath310 ; i.e. , only the ground and first excited level of the oscillator are of importance .    in the dynamics and its fourier transform for a negatively detuned qubit - oscillator system with @xmath96 are shown .",
    "like for the unbiased case detuning gives raise to longer relaxation times for the qubit .",
    "also in agreement with the unbiased case is the dominance of the frequency @xmath141 .",
    "we see that for small @xmath152 the long - time solution slightly overestimates the maxima of the oscillations and underestimats its minima .",
    "furthermore , we get here the unphysical situation that the maximum of the third oscillation in @xmath49 exceeds the value of one .",
    "the reason for that behaviour is that , by construction , we underestimate with the relaxation at short times . as for certain paramteres",
    "the term @xmath311 in can become negative , it increases too fast towards the equilibrium and gives thus raise to the observed deviations in the short time behaviour . on a longer timescale both graphs agree quite well .    for the case of positive detuning ( @xmath259 ) , which is presented in ,",
    "the upward shift of the dynamics obtained from and compared to the numerical graph of @xmath49 at small times is even stronger . to visualize that it is not a failure of the fsa approach we show in and additionally the analytical fsa solution of and calculated in .",
    "the latter agrees very well with the numerical solution . at long time - scales and for the fourier spectrum",
    "all three approaches match with each other very well.to conclude this paragraph we want to mention that all the results found both for the unbiased and the biased qubit confirm the numerical quapi results in @xcite .",
    "so far we have always considered the qubit for certain values of @xmath14 and finite or zero detuning . in this section ,",
    "we fix the oscillator frequency at @xmath284 .",
    "that means that an unbiased qubit will be at resonance with the oscillator .",
    "changing the bias to positive or negative values will always lead to negative detuning , as @xmath312 .",
    "shows a density plot of the fourier transform of the symmetrized correlation function against the bias of the qubit and the fourier frequency @xmath313 .",
    "we consider this correlation function rather than @xmath49 , as it is symmetric in the bias @xmath14 .",
    "the symmetrized correlation function is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath314 where @xmath315 .",
    "expressed in terms of the population difference @xmath49 this becomes , @xmath316 with @xmath317 and @xmath318 being symmetric and antisymmetric in @xmath14 and @xmath319 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath320 is defined as @xmath321 considering now we see that for any bias the spectrum is dominated by two frequencies , namely @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "detuning the system @xmath141 gets more and more important , as we could already observe in the two previous sections for the positively detuned systems .",
    "furthermore , the peaks are shifted to higher frequency values and at @xmath322 the relaxation peak occurs .",
    "we want to compare these results to a circuit qed experiment performed by wallraff @xcite .",
    "there the qubit is realized by a cooper pair box , which is coupled to a superconducting transmission line resonator .",
    "the properties of the system are determined by probing the resonator spectroscopically .",
    "the amplitude of a microwave probe beam transmitted through the resonator is measured versus the probe frequency and the gate charge of the cooper pair box ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) . via the gate charge",
    "the qubit can be detuned in situ from the degeneracy point .",
    "the frequency of the resonator is chosen in such a way that it is in resonance with a qubit being operated at the degeneracy point .",
    "for the resonant case two dominating frequencies , being almost equally weighted and symmetrically positioned around the cavity frequency , are observed .",
    "going away from the degeneracy point the system becomes detuned and the frequency of the cavity dominates .",
    "the behaviour we observe in is similar .",
    "however , as we are looking at the dynamics of the qubit , it corresponds to a spectroscopic measurement on the tls rather than on the oscillator .",
    "as explained above the two lowest excited states of the coupled tls - ho system , namely @xmath216 and @xmath217 , evolve from an almost symmetric superposition of basis states @xmath323 at resonance @xmath324 to the states @xmath325 and @xmath326 ( cf the left graph in ) . for @xmath327 the two peaks of the rabi splitting",
    "are observed . for @xmath96 , which means negative detuning in this case , the peak with the lower frequency corresponding to @xmath140 approaches more and more the frequency @xmath0 of the oscillator , as the state @xmath216 becomes @xmath325 for large detuning and then @xmath328 .",
    "furthermore , the transition peak at @xmath140 gets weaker as also the occupation probability of @xmath216 decreases . at @xmath329",
    "the symmetrized correlation function vanishes at @xmath140 and increases again for higher values of @xmath330 . here , the amplitude @xmath331 in @xmath49 changes its sign .",
    "in contrast the peak at @xmath141 becomes stronger with the detuning and approaches more and more the qubit splitting energy @xmath332 , as @xmath217 approaches @xmath299 and then @xmath333 .",
    "additionally , looking at the logarithmic plot one sees around @xmath334 a peak appearing , which corresponds to the frequency @xmath303 and is forbidden at @xmath95 . for large detuning",
    "it arises from transitions from @xmath299 to @xmath325 and therefore has the value @xmath335 .",
    "the amplitude of this peak is very small compared to the peaks at @xmath140 and @xmath141 and is not resolved in the experiment of wallraff .",
    "van - vleck perturbation theory enabled us to find approximately the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the full hamiltonian of the tls - ho system without performing a rotating - wave approximation . using those eigenstates and eigenenergies in a born - markov master equation we could calculate the dynamics of such a system under the influence of an environmental bath . in the following",
    "we will show how the results change if we neglect counter - rotating terms in the tls - ho hamiltonian for @xmath95 .",
    "for this we rewrite the interaction part in as @xmath336 where we identified with @xmath337 and @xmath338 a rotating and counter - rotating part of @xmath339 , respectively , and introduced the two - level transition operators @xmath340 . neglecting the counter - rotating part @xmath338 in @xmath93 leads to the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath341",
    "this hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly and its eigenstate and eigenvalues can for example be found in @xcite . in order to see the effect of not taking into account the counter - rotating terms we diagonalize @xmath342 using van - vleck perturbation theory .",
    "looking at the formula fo the effective hamiltonian in [ appvanvleck ] and keeping in mind that we set @xmath14 to zero , we see that the second order contributions in @xmath1 vanish neglecting @xmath338 ; i.e. , @xmath343 , @xmath344 are zero in . considering further the transformation matrix @xmath79 , equations and in [ appvanvleck ] show that @xmath345 for @xmath346 .",
    "thus , with we find that _ for the jaynes - cummings model @xmath347 is identical to @xmath342 _ and therefore the eigenstates of @xmath347 are simultaneously eigenstates of @xmath342 .",
    "consequently , one can determine from  the eigenstates and eigenenergies of @xmath342 .",

    "we truncated the hilbert space and found that transition processes between the groundstate and the two first excited energy levels of the qubit - ho system dominate the dynamics ( ) . in the influence of the bath was taken into account by solving the born - markov master equation for the density matrix of the qubit - ho system . to do this",
    "analytically we considered two variants of the secular approximation : first , in , the full secular approximation ( fsa ) , where all fast oscillating terms are neglected , and second , in , the partial secular approximation , where attention was paid to the fact that the first two excited energy levels are almost degenerate . using an ansatz for the long time dynamics in , we could provide a general expression for the relaxation and dephasing rates of the qubit , showing that the relaxation time can be enhanced by detuning the oscillator into the off - resonant regime . it was found that all three approaches agree quite well with the numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "the dynamics of both a biased and an unbiased qubit were intesively studied for zero and finite detuning in .",
    "the results agree qualitatively with the numerical findings within the ab - initio quapi approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a good agreement with the results of the weak damping approximation performed in @xcite for a symmetric spin - boson model was found .",
    "besides , we saw that at resonance ( @xmath222 ) the first two excited qubit oscillator states are not a symmetric or antisymmetric superposition of the states @xmath401 and @xmath325 , as predicted by the jaynes - cummings model , and thus could give an explanation for the differently weighted peaks of @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the fourier spectrum of the dynamics .",
    "we further could explain the dominance of frequency @xmath141 in the case of negative detuning @xmath402 and of frequency @xmath140 for positive detuning , respectively .",
    "moreover , we showed that for large negative detuning @xmath141 approaches the energy splitting @xmath403 of the qubit , whereas @xmath140 approximates the oscillator frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour agrees nicely with spectroscopic experiments performed on a circuit qed architecture @xcite .",
    "in we compared our results for an unbiased system to the ones obtained starting with the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "we visualize the effects of the counter - rotating terms in the bloch - siegert shift of the resonance frequency and in contributions of states with larger oscillator number to the tls dynamics . apart from this",
    "the jaynes - cummings model and our approach agree quite well for the non - dissipative case .",
    "also for the dissipative case at resonance an initial rwa represents a good approximation to our starting hamiltonian and seems to be favourable as it is analytically exactly diagonalizable . for detuned systems , however , we find discrepancies concerning relaxation and dephasing times and a rwa becomes less appropriate to give precise results .",
    "thus , we think that our approach represents an improvement as it is valid in a wider parameter range avoiding an initial rotating wave approximation . to our knowledge it provides for the first time analytical results for the dynamics of an unbiased _ and _ biased qubit coupled to a structured environment being valid both in the resonant _ and _ off - resonant regime .",
