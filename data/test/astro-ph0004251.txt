    "due to the special status of   for astrophysics and cosmology , much work has been devoted to the search for this isotope in metal - poor stars ever since the first detection in by smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this interest is threefold : _",
    "i ) _ the presence of  in the envelope of halo stars severely limits the possible depletion of , and thus allows a more accurate determination of the primordial  abundance ( ryan et al .",
    "@xcite ; asplund & carlsson @xcite ) ; _ ii ) _  abundances",
    "provide an additional test of theories for the production of the light elements ( li , be and b ) by cosmic ray processes ; _ iii ) _ since  is an even more fragile nuclei than it is a sensitive probe of possible mixing events during the stellar life .",
    "to date  is claimed to have been detected in two metal - poor halo stars , and , and two metal - poor disk stars , and ( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ; hobbs & thorburn @xcite ; cayrel et al .",
    "@xcite ; nissen et al .",
    "clearly , an observational test of models for the formation and evolution of  and for the depletion of  in stellar envelopes requires a much larger set of  data spanning a large metallicity range . with the advent of high - resolution spectrographs on 8m - class telescopes this is now becoming feasible .",
    "the determinations of  abundances are based on the increased width and asymmetry of the  670.8 nm doublet introduced by the isotope shift ( 0.16  = 7.1 ) of .",
    "since the line is not resolved , the derived  abundance depends on the adopted stellar line broadening as estimated from other spectral lines . until now",
    "all such analyses have relied on 1d hydrostatic model atmospheres which can not predict the inherent line asymmetries introduced by the convective motions in the atmosphere and thus is a potential source of uncertainty .",
    "an attractive alternative is provided by the new generation of 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres ( e.g. stein & nordlund @xcite ; asplund et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) which self - consistently compute the time - dependent convective velocity fields and thus are able to predict the convective line asymmetries .    in the present _ letter",
    "_ we analyze a high resolution , very high @xmath1 spectrum of the metal - poor halo star obtained during the commissioning of uves on vlt / kueyen using both 1d and 3d model atmospheres .",
    "thereby we also investigate the ability of uves to provide high quality spectra as needed in many astrophysical studies .",
    "the metal - poor star ( ) was chosen as one of the targets for the first commissioning of uves , the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( dodorico & kaper , @xcite ) on the eso vlt ut2 ( kueyen ) telescope .",
    "the aim was to test if uves can supply high quality spectra suitable for a determination of the lithium isotope ratio in stars  one of the most demanding problems in observational stellar astrophysics .",
    "being situated at the turnoff point for halo stars in the hr diagram , is very similar to ; hence , one would expect the li isotope ratio to be about the same , i.e. @xmath3[6]{li}/\\element[][7]{li}}\\simeq 0.06 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , g271 - 162 represents a group of about 50 halo turnoff stars with @xmath5 that are too faint to be searched for  using high resolution spectrographs at 4 m class telescopes . with uves it should be possible to reach these stars and hence to increase the sample of stars with  determinations by an order of magnitude .",
    "four spectra of were obtained on october 11 - 13 , 1999 , with exposure times ranging from 30 to 60min .",
    "the width of the entrance slit was set at 0.3 arcsec to get a resolution close to 120000 .",
    "an image slicer is foreseen for this high resolution mode of uves , but was not available during the first commissioning run . instead",
    ", the star was continuously moved along the slit within @xmath6 arcsec corresponding to approximately 50 pixels on the ccds .",
    "this widening of the echelle orders is essential in obtaining very high s / n .",
    "the lack of the image slicer made the efficiency of uves critically dependent on the seeing , but it is noted that on one night with excellent seeing on paranal ( 0.35 arcsec ) the efficiency of uves was as high as could be expected in the image slicer mode for average seeing conditions .    the red arm of uves was applied with the two ccds ( eev @xmath7 and mit - ll @xmath7 ) covering the spectral regions 610 - 705 and 715 - 810 nm in 14 and 10 echelle orders , respectively .",
    "cross disperser # 3 was chosen to provide ample space ( @xmath8 pixels ) between the orders for accurate measurement of the background .",
    "the spectra have been reduced using standard iraf tasks for order definition , background subtraction , ff division , extraction of orders , wavelength calibration and continuum normalization .",
    "the spectrum of a bright b - type star , , was observed and used to remove telluric lines present in some spectral regions .",
    "after correction for radial velocity shifts the four spectra were combined to one .",
    "[ f : lik ] shows the very high @xmath1 and resolution obtained .",
    "the wavelength calibration is based on 30 - 40 thorium lines per echelle order , and the rms of a 2-dimensional 4th order polynomial fit between pixel and wavelength space is 1.1m .",
    "in addition , the th lines can be used to check the resolution ; the instrument profile is well approximated with a gaussian and no asymmetry is seen .",
    "the resolution as measured from the fwhm of the th lines varies , however , along a given spectral order from about 100000 to 120000 .",
    "thanks to the large number of th lines available , the variation could be mapped and the actual instrumental resolution for a given stellar line determined and applied in connection with the spectrum synthesis .",
    "it is noted that this problem of resolution variations has been fixed during the second commissioning run of uves .",
    "the analysis of the  feature ( equivalent width 29.0m ) has been carried out using both 1d hydrostatic ( asplund et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 3d hydrodynamical lte model atmospheres ( asplund et al .",
    "@xcite ) . according to strmgren photometry the stellar parameters of are @xmath9k and @xmath10}}= -2.15\\pm 0.2 $ ] while the uncertain hipparcos parallax suggests @xmath11 .",
    "closely resembles for which the ir flux method ( irfm ) , the hipparcos parallax and stellar spectroscopy imply @xmath12k , @xmath13 and @xmath10}}= -2.25\\pm0.2 $ ] , which we therefore also adopt for .",
    "it should be emphasized though that the exact choice of parameters does not influence significantly the lithium _ isotope ratio _",
    "determinations although it does of course affect the _ absolute _ abundances .    when applying 1d model atmospheres to spectral synthesis additional line broadening besides the instrumental broadening is required .",
    "this broadening , which is mainly due to macroturbulence , was approximated by a gaussian function and determined from a @xmath14 fit of five unblended lines ( 612.2 , 616.2 , 623.0 , 643.9 , and 769.9 nm ) , all of similar strength as the 670.8 nm line . in the case of the 769.9 nm resonance line the hyperfine structure and isotopic shift between  and",
    "were taken into account although the effect turned out to be rather negligible .",
    "a more sophisticated broadening like a radial - tangential profile did not improve the agreement with the observed profiles .",
    "in contrast , in hydrodynamical model atmospheres the self - consistent convective motions account for all of the line broadening except for the unknown rotational velocity  of the star .",
    "this parameter was determined by fitting a disk - integration of the angle - dependent theoretical 3d line profiles to the observed profiles of the ,  and  lines .",
    "the comparison between theoretical and observed profiles was quantified using a @xmath14 analysis in an analogous way to previous investigations ( nissen et al .",
    "the @xmath14 was computed through @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the observed spectral point , @xmath17 the synthesis and @xmath18 as estimated in two adjacent continuum windows to the lines . when estimating the fwhm of the gaussian broadening ( 1d ) and  ( 3d ) , the abundance and the wavelength zeropoint of the observed spectrum were allowed to vary to optimize the fit ( figs .",
    "[ f : ca1d ] and [ f : ca3d ] ) .",
    "the most probable value corresponds to the minimum of @xmath14 and @xmath19 and 9 represent the 1- , 2- and 3@xmath20 confidence limits of the determinations .",
    "these broadening parameters were subsequently used in a similar @xmath14 analysis of the 670.8 nm line .",
    "the free parameters in the comparison between the predicted and observed profile were , besides the  fraction , the total li abundance and the wavelength zeropoint of the observed profile .",
    "it is emphasized that for each value of /  the other free parameters are optimized to get the smallest possible value of @xmath14 .    the 1d analysis of the",
    ",  and  lines implies a @xmath21of the stellar line broadening function .",
    "however , the detailed agreement with the observations are far from perfect ( fig . [",
    "f : ca1d ] ) . in particular , the distinct red asymmetry of all lines similar to the solar case ( e.g. asplund et al .",
    "@xcite ) is not accounted for .",
    "the result of the @xmath14 analysis of the 670.8 nm doublet suggests a possible detection of : @xmath3[6]{li}/\\element[][7]{li}}= 0.02\\pm0.01 $ ] ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit , is satisfactory close to 1 .",
    "the temperature inhomogeneities and velocity fields in the 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres introduce characteristic line asymmetries , which for the sun perfectly describe the observed asymmetries even on an absolute wavelength scale ( asplund et al .",
    "the existence of the predicted line asymmetries in the 3d analysis vastly improves the agreement with the observed profiles for ( fig .",
    "[ f : ca3d ] ) ; other lines show similarly encouraging correspondence .",
    "this provides additional support for the realism of the 3d model when describing the real stellar photosphere , as well as giving a higher degree of confidence in the estimate of the lithium isotope ratio .",
    "the stellar rotation was determined to be @xmath24 , which in turn implies @xmath3[6]{li}/\\element[][7]{li}}= 0.02\\pm0.01 $ ] ( @xmath4 ) according to fig [ f : chi3d ] , the same result as in the 1d analysis .",
    "again , the minimum @xmath25 is close to 1 as it should .",
    "both the 1d and 3d analyses suggest a possible detection of  in at the level of @xmath3[6]{li}/\\element[][7]{li}}\\ = 0.02\\pm0.01 $ ] .",
    "given the remaining uncertainties in the determination of the stellar line broadening ( e.g. nlte effects ) the detection should , however , be considered preliminary .",
    "the similarity between the 1d and 3d results and the excellent agreement between the observed and predicted profiles in 3d , could be interpreted as support for a positive detection though .",
    "it also lends added confidence to previous detections of  in metal - poor stars based on 1d investigations ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "@xcite ; nissen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . evidently , the convective line asymmetries are rather negligible compared to the isotopic shift of the  doublet",
    ".    regardless of whether  has been detected in or not , the /  ratio appears in any case to be smaller than in for which a weighted average of the results of hobbs & thorburn ( @xcite ) , smith et al .",

    "( @xcite ) is @xmath3[6]{li}/\\element[][7]{li}}= 0.059 \\pm 0.016 \\,\\ , ( 1\\sigma)$ ] .",
    "this is quite puzzling , because the two stars have almost identical parameters according to the @xmath26-@xmath27 photometry of schuster & nissen ( @xcite ) .",
    "table 1 lists the measured indices for the three halo stars with  measurements after correction for a small reddening of g271 - 162 , @xmath28 , as derived from the the @xmath27 - @xmath29 calibration of schuster & nissen ( @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite ) in excellent agreement with the values in table 2 , whereas has not been measured .",
    "the absolute magnitude of from the hipparcos parallax ( esa , @xcite ) is @xmath31 in good agreement with the photometric value within the quoted errors .",
    "for the two other stars the relative error of the hipparcos parallax is far too large to estimate @xmath30 with any reasonable accuracy .",
    "finally , a preliminary abundance analysis shows that and have the same metal abundances within @xmath32  dex .",

    "[ f : hr ] shows the location of the three stars in the  diagram . clearly , and have nearly the same mass .",
    "this makes it difficult to explain the lower  abundance in as a depletion effect and raises the interesting question of a possible intrinsic scatter of /  in the ism at a given metallicity . in this connection",
    "we note that some models for the formation of the light elements by cosmic ray processes in the early galaxy predict a scatter of one order of magnitude in the abundance of , be and b relative to fe , e.g. the bimodal superbubble model of parizot & drury ( @xcite ) and the supernovae - driven chemical evolution model for the galactic halo by suzuki et al .",
