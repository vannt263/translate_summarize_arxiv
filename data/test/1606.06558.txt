    "one of the alternative theory to standard model of general relativity is conformal gravity ( cg ) , which is able to solve some problems of einstein gravity .",
    "thus it is worth investigating this theory in more detail .",
    "cg ( see @xcite and references therein ) can produce a linear terms which explain galactic rotation curve without considering dark matter , and it confirms newtonian gravity in solar system . also it explains the accelerated expansion of the universe without dark energy .",
    "this theory is in four dimensions and the action of cg consists of the weyl tensor , @xmath2 .",
    "the conformal transformation is @xmath3 , which sensitive to the angle , but not to distances .",
    "study of the orbits of test particles and light rays in conformal spacetimes help to understand the physical properties of conformal field equations . on the other hand",
    ", the motion of matter and light can be used to classify a given spacetime , and to highlight its characteristics . using the analytic solutions of the geodesic equation",
    ", we obtain some information about the spacetime properties of the black holes @xcite . in 1931",
    "hagihara @xcite , solved the geodesic equation in a schwarzschild spacetime using applied of the elliptic weierstrass function .",
    "the solutions for kerr and kerr - newman space times have the same mathematical structure @xcite and can be solved analogously .",
    "the mathematical method which is used to solve the equations of motion in schwarzschild ( anti ) de sitter spacetime , is the hyper elliptic functions .",
    "these functions are based on the solution of the jacobi inversion problem . @xcite .",
    "also these methods are applicabied for other spacetime such as , reissner - nordstrom and reissner - nordstrom -(anti)-de sitter @xcite and spinning black ring spacetimes @xcite . moreover , this analytically method are used for some spacetimes such as @xmath4 gravity , btz , gmghs black holes , cylindrically symmetric conformal and ( rotating ) black string-(anti- ) de sitter in refs .",

    ", we study geodesic equations for spherically symmetric in the vicinity of blackhole in conformal gravity . in cg ,",
    "some investigations predicate that the only null geodesics are physically meaningful in the theory of conformal gravity @xcite .",
    "but , there are some different descriptions on applicability of geodesic solution in this theory , such as , free fall of elementary particles or packets of gravitational energy of geons which is proposed by wheeler @xcite .",
