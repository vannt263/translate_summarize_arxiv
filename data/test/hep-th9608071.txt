    "calculations of the casimir energy in spherically symmetric situations have attracted the interest of physicists for well over forty years now .",
    "this is not strange , since in many contexts the inclusion of quantum fluctuations about semi - classical configurations turns out to be essential .",
    "historically a first far reaching idea involving vacuum energies originated with casimir himself .",
    "he proposed that the force stabilizing a classical electron model arises from the zero - point energy of the electromagnetic field within and without a perfectly conducting spherical shell @xcite .",
    "having found an attractive force between parallel plates due to the vacuum energy @xcite , the hope was that the same would occur for the spherically symmetric situation .",
    "unfortunately , as boyer @xcite first showed , for this geometry the stress is repulsive @xcite .",
    "nowadays it is known that the casimir energy depends strongly on the geometry of the space - time and on the boundary conditions imposed .",
    "this is still a very active field of research because a satisfactory understanding of the behaviour has not yet been found . for a number of results obtained in the last five years",
    "see for instance @xcite-@xcite .",
    "more recently the zero - point energy has got considerable attention in the context of the bag model @xcite-@xcite and chiral bag model @xcite-@xcite . in those models",
    "the quarks and gluons are free inside the bag , but are absolutely confined to the interior of the bag .",
    "the sum of the mesonic , valence quark and vacuum quark contributions to the baryonic number have been found to be independent of the bag radius and of the pion field strength , being the vacuum quark contributions which are analogue to the casimir effect in qed essential in the calculation of baryonic observables .",
    "the issue of regularization is certainly non - trivial . under some circumstances ,",
    "different regularization procedures can yield different results and real physical problems arise in the calculation of quark vacuum contributions to some barionic observables , as the energy itself .    for massless fermions",
    "the zero - point energy was considered in @xcite .",
    "the massless fermionic field inside and outside the spherical bag was analysed in @xcite . in the last case ,",
    "a cancellation of divergences between the inner and outer spaces occurs and finite zero - point energies are found . considering only the inner space ,",
    "divergences appear and it is necessary to introduce contact terms and perform a renormalization of their coupling .",
    "results for the massive fermionic fields contain new ultraviolet - divergent terms in addition to those occurring in the massless case , as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "further considerations , especially on the renormalization procedure necessary in order to carry out these calculations , and on its precise interpretation , can be found in @xcite .    in nearly all of the mentioned works",
    "the authors have used a green s function approach in order to calculate the zero - point energy .",
    "an exception is ref .",
    "@xcite , where , in the general setting of an ultrastatic spacetime with or without boundaries , a systematic procedure which makes use of zeta function regularization was developed . in this approach , a knowledge of the zeta function of the operator associated with the field equation together with ( eventually ) some appropriate boundary conditions is needed .",
    "recently , a detailed description of how to obtain the zeta function for a massive scalar field inside a ball satisfying dirichlet or robin boundary conditions has been given by some of the authors @xcite of the present work . an analytical continuation to the whole complex plane has been obtained and then applied to find an arbitrary number of heat - kernel coefficients . in the ensuing refs .",
    "@xcite the functional determinant has been considered too and , furthermore , the method has been also applied to spinors @xcite and p - forms @xcite . for an alternative approach involving scalars and spinors",
    "see also the developments in @xcite .",
    "all the above considerations yield purely analytical and quite explicit formulas . in order to actually obtain values for the casimir energy , however , a numerical integration had to be performed .",
    "this has been done in different cases , in particular for the massless scalar and electromagnetic fields @xcite , partly reobtaining previous results .    here",
    "we will consider the massive scalar field inside and outside the bag , separately .",
    "we will discuss in detail the renormalization procedure which is necessary to apply in this situation and , specifically , the differences occurring with respect to the case when one assumes that the field occupies the whole space .",
    "the final result for the zero - point energy contains several constants which experience renormalization and whose physical values can be determined only experimentally .",
    "however , for the massive field as is clear from dimensional grounds non - trivial finite parts which depend on an adimensional variable involving the mass are present , and we will , in this case , be able to find here for the first time the complete , renormalized zero - point energy .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect .  2 we describe in detail the models considered and the regularization and renormalization procedure employed . in sect .",
    "3 we summarize briefly the formulas that are needed in the subsequent study of the zeta function of the problem at hand .",
    "we shall start with the scalar field inside the ball .",
    "some additional considerations are necessary because the representation given in the previous articles @xcite was only applicable when the mass of the field is @xmath0 . here",
    "we will derive formulas which are valid for arbitrary mass and very useful for numerical evaluations .",
    "all divergences and finite parts of the zero - point energy are calculated and its renormalization is performed with some care . the explicit dependence of the finite part in the mass is determined numerically .",
    "afterwards , the exterior space is considered and a corresponding analysis is performed for this situation . adding up both contributions , we see clearly how the divergences cancel among themselves as well as the influence of this cancellation on the compulsory renormalization process .",
    "4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the appendices contain some hints and technical details that are used in the derivation of the zeta function for the non - zero mass case .",
    "the physical system that we will consider consists of two parts :    1 .   a classical system consisting of a spherical surface ( ` bag ' ) of radius @xmath1 .",
    "its energy reads : e_class = p v + s + f r + k + , [ n1 ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the volume and surface , respectively .",
    "this energy is determined by the parameters @xmath4 pressure , @xmath5 surface tension , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 which do not have special names .",
    "2 .   a quantum field @xmath9 obeying the equation ( + m^2)(x ) = 0 , as well as boundary conditions on the surface .",
    "we choose dirichlet boundary conditions for simplicity .",
    "the quantum field has a ground state energy e_0 = 1 2 _ ( k ) _",
    "( k ) ^1/2 , [ n30 ] where the @xmath10 s are the one - particle energies with the quantum number @xmath7 .    for this system we shall consider three models , which will behave in a different way .",
    "these models consist of the classical part given by the surface and    * the quantum field in the interior of the surface , * the quantum field in the exterior of the surface , * the quantum field in both regions together ,    respectively .",
    "the ground state energy is divergent and we shall regularize it by e_0 = 1 2 _ ( k ) _ ( k ) ^1/2 -s ^2s .s>2 .",
    "[ n3 ] the one particle energies are determined by the eigenvalue equation ( -+m^2 ) _ ( k ) ( x ) = _ ( k ) _ ( k ) ( x)[1 ] with dirichlet boundary conditions on the surface _ ( k ) ( x)_| _",
    "@xmath11 is obvious : @xmath12 , @xmath13 ,   @xmath14 .    for the calculations we use the corresponding zeta",
    "function : ( s)=_(k ) _",
    "( k)^-s.in the interior region , we have _ ( int ) ( s)=_l=0^_n=0^(2l+1 ) _",
    "( l , m , n)^-s .",
    "[ intzeta ] for the exterior zeta function @xmath15 we must take into account that the radial quantum number is continuous .",
    "we have to subtract the minkowski space contribution .",
    "this procedure is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) and need not be repeated here .    in the case of the third model we have simply to add the interior and the exterior zeta functions , namely _ ( total ) ( s)= _ ( int ) ( s)+ _ ( ext ) ( s).[z3 ] thus , in any case the regularized ground state energy is given by e_0^(mod ) = _ ( mod ) ( s- )  ^2s , where @xmath16 means the model : @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the divergent contributions of the ground state energy can be found most easily using standard heat kernel expansion k ( t ) = _ ( k ) e^-_(k ) t ~ ( 1 4t)^3/2 e^-tm^2 _ j=0,1/2,1, ...",

    "the corresponding contributions to the energy read : e_0(div ) & = & - b_0 ( 1 s+ -1 2 + ) -b_1/2 + & & + b_1 ( 1 s+ - 1 + ) + m 16 ^ 3/2b_3/2[n7 ] + & & -1 32 ^ 2 b_2 ( 1 s+ - 2 + ) .the heat kernel coefficients are well known ( see for instance @xcite ) and are , for the interior region , b^(int)_0 = 4 3 r^3,b^(int)_1/2 = -2 ^ 3/2 r , b^(int)_1 = 8 3 r , b^(int)_3/2 = -1 6 ^3/2 , b^(int)_2 = r.in the exterior region , we have : b^(ext)_i & = & b^(ext)_i , i= , , ... , + b^(ext)_i & = & - b^(ext)_i , i=0,1,2 , ... [ cancel ] .    in order to perform the renormalization we choose as general scheme the following : all contributions of the heat kernel coefficients which can lead to divergences in some regularization have to be subtracted by means of a renormalization of the corresponding parameters in the classical part of the system .",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "the zeta functional regularization used here leaves the contributions of coefficients with half integer number finite in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "this is a specific feature of this regularization and often much appreciated .",
    "however , in other regularizations , as for example the proper time cutoff @xcite , these contributions are divergent .",
    "thus , we have in each of the first two models five divergent contributions . in the third model",
    "we note that , in accordance with ( [ z3 ] ) , @xmath23 and due to the known cancellation of divergent contributions , which is in fact due to ( [ cancel ] ) , only two of them remain .    as physical system we consider the classical part and the ground state energy of the quantum field together and write for the complete energy e = e_(class)+e_0 . in this context",
    "the renormalization can be achieved by shifting the parameters in @xmath24 by an amount which cancels the divergent contributions and removes completely the contribution of the corresponding heat kernel coefficients . in the first two models we have : p & & p ( 1 s -1 2 + ) , + , + f & & f ( 1 s - 1 + ) , k k - m 96 , [ n8 ] + h & & h1 630 ( 1 s - 2 + ) , where the upper sign corresponds to the first model and the lower sign to the second .",
    "in the third model there are only two contributions , which are divergent in some regularizations , and the renormalization reads : + , kk- .",
    "[ n8a ] within the zeta functional regularization this is a finite renormalization .",
    "after the subtraction of these contributions from @xmath25 we denote it by @xmath26 and the complete energy becomes e = e_(class)+e_0^(ren ) . within our renormalization scheme",
    ", we have defined a unique renormalized groundstate energy @xmath27 .",
    "often , the renormalization arbitrariness is removed by imposing some normalization conditions . in this case",
    "a natural candidate would be the requirement , that @xmath27 vanishes for @xmath28 .",
    "this is fulfilled in our case .",
    "however , this requirement does not fix completely the renormalization in the first two models because a finite renormalization of @xmath8 is still possible .",
    "with respect to this renormalization there is a qualitative difference between the first two and the third model . in the latter one some divergences have been cancelled when adding up the contributions from the interior and exterior regions .",
    "the corresponding terms in the classical energy do not need to be renormalized .",
    "in general , as mentioned in @xcite and much earlier in connection with the renormalization of qed , those contributions which need a renormalization are not of quantum nature but have to be present in the classical part of the system and are to be determined from outside ( like the electron mass and charge in qed ) or by the dynamics of the classical part .",
    "for example , in the bag model one has to look for a minimum of the complete energy while varying these parameters .",
    "the contributions which do not need renormalization , like the one resulting from @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 in the third model , may be absent in the classical part and can be considered as pure quantum contributions . in this sense",
    "the third model contains only two classical parameters ( @xmath32 and @xmath7 ) .    having in mind that only the complete energy has a physical meaning ,",
    "a change of the normalization conditions , respectively a finite renormalization , would be equivalent to a change of the classical parameters and should not influence issues like that of finding a minimum of the complete energy by varying the parameters of the classical part .",
    "special remarks are in order for the case of a massless quantum field .",
    "there only contributions from @xmath31 remain ( one performs the limit @xmath33 in the regularized expressions , the @xmath20 s are proportional to @xmath34 ) . in the third model",
    "these contributions are finite and can be considered as pure quantum corrections .",
    "they yield , together with the finite contributions ( cf . the quantity @xmath35 in the next section ) , the known @xmath36 contributions to the casimir energy for a sphere and a massless field with various boundary conditions .",
    "however , in the models ( i ) and ( ii ) the @xmath31 contribution is divergent and the corresponding @xmath36 term in the energy must be considered as a classical contribution .",
    "thus , in these cases the ground state energy for a massless field can be removed by a finite renormalization and the energy of the system remains formally the classical one . in that sense",
    "there is no casimir effect .",
    "the same is true in the presence of a thick spherical shell ( interior and exterior region are separated by a finite distance with no quantum field ) , because here no cancellation between interior and exterior modes occurs .",
    "similar remarks hold not only for a spherical bag but also for an arbitrarily shaped bag . for the infinitely thin bag a cancellation between interior and exterior modes",
    "does occur , while if it has a finite thickness this is not true anymore .",
    "first we consider the interior case .",
    "as it is easily seen from equation ( [ n3 ] ) , the task that remains for the evaluation of the zero - point energy is to perform a convenient analytical treatment of the zeta function ( [ intzeta ] ) .",
    "a precise way to obtain an analytic continuation of @xmath37 to @xmath38 has been described in @xcite in detail , what allows us to be brief here .",
    "we may write the zeta function for the interior space in the form _ ( int ) ( s ) = n_(int)(s ) + _ i=-1 ^ 3 a_i ( s),[4 ] where the @xmath39 s are the contributions of the first five terms of the uniform asymptotic expansion of the modified bessel functions as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 fixed .",
    "it is sufficient to subtract these five contributions in order to absorb all possible divergent contributions",
    ". a higher number of subtractions is possible in order to speed up the convergence of the remaining numerical expressions .",
    "we have called @xmath35 the zeta function where all these asymptotic terms have been subtracted : n_(int)(s)&= & _ l=0^ ( 2l+1 ) _ mr/^dx ^-s   + & & , where we have set @xmath43 , and @xmath44 $ ] . in this formula",
    "the parameter @xmath45 can be put equal to @xmath46 under the integration and summation signs .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath47 is the remaining numerical task .",
    "the polynomials @xmath48 are d_1 ( t ) & = & _ a=0 ^ 1 x_1,a t^1 + 2a1 8 t -5 24t^3 , + d_2 ( t ) & = & _ a=0 ^ 2 x_2,a t^2 + 2a1 16 t^2 -3 8 t^4 + 5 16 t^6,[6 ] + d_3 ( t ) & = & _ a=0 ^ 3",
    "x_3,a t^3 + 2a t^3 - t^5 + t^7 -t^9 , and , in terms of their coefficients , @xmath49 , the functions @xmath50 are given by a_-1 ( s ) & = & _ j=0^(mr)^2j_h ( 2j+2s -2;1/2 ) , + a_0 ( s ) & = & -_j=0^(mr)^2j(s+j ) _ h ( 2j+2s-1;1/2),[7 ] + a_i ( s ) & = & -_j=0^(mr)^2j _ h ( -1+i+2j+2s;1/2 ) + & & _ a=0^ix_i , a .it is easy to see that the above series are convergent for @xmath51 .",
    "alternative representations valid for arbitrary values of @xmath52 are derived in app .",
    "a. using the above formulas , or alternatively , the formulas given in the appendix , one can perform the renomalization and calculate the renormalized ground state energy numerically .",
    "the result for the ground state energy is shown in fig . 1 for @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 on the radius for fixed mass is depicted in fig .",
    "it is seen that there is a maximimum for @xmath56 .",
    "for very small values of the argument @xmath57 , the figure diverges to @xmath58 , whereas for large values , the function goes to zero . in fig .",
    "2 we have restricted the domain around the aforementioned maximum .    the zero - point energy in the exterior of the spherical bag can be calculated in a much similar manner .",
    "indeed , only a few changes are necessary . subtracting the minkowski space zeta function from the zeta function associated with the field outside the bag",

    "as is clear , one just needs to substitute the bessel function @xmath59 for @xmath60 . the asymptotic contributions ,",
    "as compared with those for the interior space , get an alternating sign coming from the asymptotics of the bessel function @xmath61 , which exhibit this sign , as compared with those of the function @xmath60 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by construction , @xmath62 is finite at @xmath38 .",
    "the results for @xmath63 are given in app .",
    "a. they are the same as in the previous case . again , the renormalized ground state energy can be calculated .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "it is apparent that the slope is always negative and that the plot always gives positive values .",
    "it is clear that , had we plotted the same quantity in units of the mass , a curve with both these properties would have been obtained too . in particular , it would not have a maximum as the one observed for the interior case .    in the case of the third model ,",
    "i.e. , for the quantum field extending to both regions altogether , we just have to add the two results above . as is shown in fig .",
    "4 , there is an interval where the slope is positive . this would seem to leave open the possibility that a plot in units of the mass could exhibit a maximum .",
    "we have carefully investigated this possibility but the answer is negative . in other words ,",
    "such alternative plot is always monotonically decreasing .",
    "in this paper we have developed a systematic approach to the calculation of the casimir energy of a massive field in the presence of a spherical bag .",
    "the models corresponding to the quantum field confined to the interior and to the exterior space of the bag , respectively , have been discussed separately , and the differences in the renormalization of these models with respect to the case where the field is present in the whole space have been investigated in detail .",
    "figures 1 - 4 show the quantum contribution to the renormalized ground state energy .",
    "this quantum ground state energy of the interior region exhibits a maximum for variable radius and fixed mass , as is clear from fig .",
    ", we may say that if the bag is small enough , the quantum part of the vacuum energy induces an attractive force which is partly a result of our renormalization prescription by which the energy is normalized to zero in the infinite mass limit .",
    "this is the physically correct choice and , in order to deal with it , treatment of the massive case is necessary .",
    "the appearance of attractive forces in this kind of situation is not new , however , and has been found also when dealing with spinors @xcite and with the electromagnetic field on a dielectric cylinder @xcite .",
    "robin boundary conditions can be treated in complete analogy , as has been described in detail in refs . @xcite-@xcite .",
    "also the interior and exterior regions can be considered separately , and adding up the contributions coming from each region the same cancellation of divergences appear .",
    "the ground state energy of the electromagnetic field is the sum of the ground state energy of two scalar fields satisfying , respectively , dirichlet boundary conditions and robin boundary conditions ( te and tm modes ) .",
    "the @xmath64 heat kernel coefficient has opposite sign for dirichlet and robin boundary conditions , what leads to a partial cancellation of divergences between the te and tm modes .",
    "doing the same kind of calculation than the one presented here and taking the massless limit , previous results are reobtained @xcite , what provides a further check of the procedure .    along the same lines",
    ", it would be interesting to perform the calculations for higher spin fields and to apply the results to realistic physical models , as the mit bag model for instance .",
    "furthermore , in complete analogy , the case of two spherical shells can be treated with our method .",
    "also , the influence of dielectric media can be considered for the case of an electromagnetic field .",
