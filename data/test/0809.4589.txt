    "the increasing predictive power of these models is beginning to drive even more challenging observations . on the other hand , the precision and accuracy with which the most basic planet properties such as the mass and radius can be determined is currently limited by our knowledge of the properties of the host stars .",
    "significant uncertainties remain in the stellar mass and radius determinations of many systems . in some cases",
    "this is due to poorly determined photospheric properties ( mainly temperature and metallicity ) , and in others to a lack of an accurate luminosity estimate .",

    "recent improvements in the analysis techniques have the potential to increase the accuracy of the stellar and planetary parameters significantly , especially for the large majority without a direct distance estimate .",

    "have recently reanalyzed a large subset of the known transiting planets , incorporating these improvements and applying a uniform methodology to all systems .    in the present work we focus on two of the recently discovered transiting systems , @xcite and @xcite , which lack accurate estimates for the photospheric properties of the parent stars and as a result have more uncertain stellar and planetary parameters . to improve upon these properties , we present new radial - velocity and photometric observations of",
    "with which we refine both the light curve solution and the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "we also carry out a reanalysis of existing photometry utilizing a technique which treats stellar limb darkening using adjustable parameters .",
    "we perform the first detailed spectroscopic determination of the photospheric properties of both stars , and we make use of the constraint on the stellar density mentioned above to infer more accurate values for the stellar and planetary masses and radii . our paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : obs ] we summarize the observations . in  [ sec : atmpar ] we present our effective temperature and metallicity determinations , along with several consistency checks aimed at establishing the accuracy of the temperatures . in  [ sec : orb ] we report an updated spectroscopic orbital solution for , and the light curve solutions for both systems are discussed in  [ lcanalysis ] .",
    "section[sec : physics ] then describes our determination of the stellar masses and radii , which in turn lead to refined values for the planetary parameters over those reported in the discovery papers .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : summ ] by providing a summary of our results and by discussing whether the properties of the host stars give any useful clues on the origin of the strongly contrasting densities of their close - in gas giant planets , particularly in comparison with the other known transiting planet systems .",

    "the top panel indicates excellent agreement between the two ; the linear fit has a slope of 1.011 .",
    "there are no significant correlations with the line strength ( see middle panel ) : the fractional difference between ews measured by the two methods has a probability of no correlation of 0.1 .",
    "finally , the histogram in the bottom panel shows there is no appreciable systematic difference between the methods .",
    "the mean difference and scatter are only 0.67 m and 2.6 m , respectively , which are smaller than found by @xcite from a similar comparison between feros , harps and uves spectra .",
    "consequently , the results of the abundance analysis with moog using ews measured with ares are virtually identical to those presented earlier .    following @xcite we also synthesized a number of unblended lines in the template spectra of both and , and determined projected rotational velocities of @xmath35 @xmath29  and @xmath36 @xmath29 , respectively .    our new determinations of the atmospheric parameters for the parent stars of and are generally in good agreement with the values reported by @xcite and @xcite , the main difference being that those authors assumed [ fe / h ] = 0.0 in their studies , whereas we find significant departures from solar metallicity in both stars .",
    "we describe here additional estimates of the effective temperature for and that serve to test the accuracy of our determinations above .",
    "both planet host stars were observed spectroscopically with the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) digital speedometer @xcite as part of the regular follow - up after the discovery of photometric signals suggesting transits .",
    "these observations cover 45    in a single echelle order centered at 5187   , and have @xmath38 .",
    "while this resolving power is moderately high , the snrs of the spectra are low , ranging from 7 to 13 per resolution element of 8.5  @xmath29  for the 13 exposures of , and snrs of 1113 for the 7 exposures of .",
    "nevertheless , useful information on the stellar properties can be extracted from these spectra as described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , the observed spectra are cross - correlated against a library of synthetic spectra based on kurucz model atmospheres ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , calculated over a wide range of values of @xmath37 , @xmath15 , [ fe / h ] , and rotational velocity @xmath39 . the combination of parameters yielding the highest correlation averaged over all exposures is adopted as a representation of the properties of the star . due to the narrow wavelength range and limited snrs ,",
    "the first three of the above properties are typically strongly correlated and are difficult to determine simultaneously . given these constraints , in the discovery papers we initially held the metallicity fixed at the solar value for both stars .",
    "for , which our keck spectroscopy indicates is slightly metal - poor , we repeated the above determination using a fixed metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath40 , and interpolated @xmath37 and @xmath15 to the precise composition from table  [ star_tres3 ] .",
    "we obtained @xmath41  k and @xmath42 , where the uncertainties include contributions both from the error in the adopted [ fe / h ] and the internal errors .",
    "the temperature as well as the surface gravity are consistent with the keck determinations , within the uncertainties .",
    "similarly for we repeated the determinations for [ fe / h ] @xmath43 , given the metal - rich composition indicated by the keck spectroscopy , and interpolated to the intermediate value from table  [ star_tres4 ] .",
    "the results are @xmath44  k and @xmath45 , which are once again in good agreement with the more reliable estimate from keck .",
    "while the temperature determinations discussed so far are implicitly based on the _ strength _ of the spectral lines , @xcite have demonstrated that highly precise information can also be extracted using the _ ratio _ of the depths of two spectral lines having different sensitivity to temperature .",
    "however , rather than yielding absolute temperatures , this technique in its original formulation only measures changes in temperature , albeit with extremely high precision often reaching a few kelvin ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "absolute temperatures can still be obtained with recourse to external color - temperature calibrations , since line - depth ratios ( ldrs ) are usually strongly correlated with the color index of the star .",
    "the accuracy of such @xmath37 determinations is then limited by the calibrations themselves .",
    "@xcite have presented ldr-@xmath37 calibrations based on 26 carefully selected lines of fe , v , sc , si , and ni in the spectral interval 61906280   , grouped into 16 line pairs .",
    "these calibrations are valid for stars with temperatures between @xmath163800  k and @xmath166000  k , so unfortunately the technique is not applicable to . for we measured all 26 lines in our high - snr keck template spectrum , and adopted the @xcite calibrations appropriate for stars with rotational velocities of 10  @xmath29  ( very close to the @xmath46 value reported by @xcite and obtained also in this work ) .",
    "the temperature scale of these relations relies on a transformation between @xmath47 and @xmath37 by @xcite , which makes use of a mixture of dwarf and giant temperatures obtained by many different methods and does not account for differences in metallicity .",
    "for the present work we have preferred to use more sophisticated color - temperature relations such as those by @xcite and @xcite , which account not only for luminosity class but include also metallicity terms , and are based on effective temperatures derived homogeneously by the infrared flux method .",
    "the conversion from the ldr - based @xmath37 inferred from the @xcite relations back to an average color for the star using the @xcite prescription gives @xmath48 .",
    "our two preferred color - temperature relations mentioned above then yield a weighted average temperature of @xmath49  k for , in which the uncertainty includes observational errors propagated from the ldr measurements as well as the scatter of the calibrations .",
    "this result is consistent with our more direct estimate in  [ sec : keck ] .",
    "as is well known , the wings of the @xmath51 line ( but not its core , formed higher up in the atmosphere under non - lte conditions ) are very sensitive to @xmath24 variations , but are relatively insensitive to changes in @xmath15 and [ fe / h ] ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this allows for a useful consistency check on our @xmath24 estimates above . we compared the observed h@xmath50 line profiles in our keck template spectra of and against synthetic profiles for solar - metallicity dwarfs ( [ fe / h ] = 0.0 , @xmath52 ) from the kurucz database .",
    "the results of this exercise are displayed in figure  [ halpha ] , in which 10    regions centered on h@xmath50 are shown for each star together with four calculated profiles for different values of @xmath24 . in both cases the temperatures one would infer from these comparisons agree well with the estimates reported in table  [ star_tres3 ] and table  [ star_tres4 ] .",
    "an additional check on the effective temperatures is available from the multi - color photometry for and .",
    "measurements in johnson @xmath53 , cousins @xmath54 , and 2mass @xmath55 were used to derive seven color indices for , and nine for when considering also the @xmath56 and @xmath57 measurements from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite .",
    "the calibrations by @xcite and @xcite then yielded weighted average temperatures of @xmath58  k and @xmath59  k for and , respectively , ignoring extinction and adopting [ fe / h ] in each case as determined in  [ sec : keck ] .",
    "the uncertainties include photometric errors and metallicity errors , as well as the scatter of the calibrations , but exclude unquantified systematic errors in the calibrations themselves .",
    "these temperatures are 260  k and 65  k cooler than our spectroscopic determinations above .",
    "they can be reconciled with the values in  [ sec : keck ] if we assume the presence of reddening , and correct each of the indices . for the required value of @xmath60 is hardly significant ( @xmath61 mag ) , but for we obtain @xmath62 mag . ,",
    "in which the ldr - based @xmath47 color is significantly bluer than the measured value of @xmath63 @xcite . ] for comparison , the reddening maps of @xcite and @xcite indicate a _",
    "total _ reddening along the line of sight to each star of only @xmath64 mag , and similar results are obtained from the model of galactic dust distribution by  @xcite .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the small value we infer for , but it is much smaller than our estimate for .",
    "possible explanations include patchy interstellar material combined with the relatively coarse resolution of these maps ( a few arc minutes for * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or perhaps the presence of circumstellar material in .",
    "the reliability of age indicators for stars older than 12  gyr , such as chromospheric activity and lithium ( li ) abundance , as well as their interagreement , have been the subject of much debate in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the difficulties are due to many factors , including ( but not limited to ) non - trivial correlations between chromospheric activity , rotation , mass , and age , limited availability of activity estimates averaged over entire stellar activity cycles  that range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "these correspond to ages of @xmath67  gyr and @xmath16 2.5  gyr , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] , insufficient understanding of the temporal evolution of li depletion due to the complex interplay between various processes ( e.g. , convection , mixing , diffusion , mass loss ) , and non - negligible differences in the observed behavior of chromospheric activity and li depletion as a function of mass , age , and chemical abundance between stars in young and old clusters , and in the field .",
    "we have nonetheless attempted to use the activity indicator and the lithium abundance as measured in our hires spectra of and to provide independent constraints for comparison with the formal age estimates determined below from evolutionary models ( see  [ sec : physics ] ) , as well as to search for possible peculiarities of these two planet hosts compared to other samples of stars with and without planets .",

    "clear emission is seen in the core of the line of , but not in . following the procedure outlined in @xcite we measured the chromospheric emission ratio @xmath68 , corrected for the photospheric contribution , from the h and k lines in each of our spectra .",
    "we obtained @xmath69 and @xmath70 for and , respectively .",
    "thus appears moderately active , while is quite the opposite .",
    "the resulting chromospheric age estimates , using the relations summarized in @xcite , are @xmath71 gyr for and @xmath72 gyr for .    in figure  [ licomp ]",
    "we show the results of the spectral synthesis of a 10    region centered on the li  @xmath736707.8 line , using the atmospheric parameters derived from the fe - line analysis and the line list of @xcite .",
    "the two panels display the comparison between the observed spectra and three synthetic spectra , each differing only in the assumed li abundance .",
    "neither star shows a measurable li line , and we can only place upper limits of @xmath74 and @xmath75 for and , respectively . by comparison with average li abundance curves as a function of effective temperature for clusters of different ages @xcite , one would infer a rather old age for of @xmath76 gyr , nominally inconsistent with the estimate above from the activity index . based on its li the object appears decidedly older than hyades stars of the same @xmath24 , and this argument",
    "is corroborated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by the small @xmath46 we measure ( see table  [ star_tres3 ] ) . for",
    ", the age inferred from the @xcite relations is @xmath77 gyr , which is in qualitative agreement with the absence of significant chromospheric activity as well as with the inferred value of the surface gravity ( see table  [ star_tres4 ] ) , which indicates the star is somewhat evolved .",
    "the measured li abundance for is in line with values determined by @xcite for a sub - sample of nearby planet hosts with the same @xmath24 , while appears more depleted than other planet hosts of similar @xmath24 , @xmath78 , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "we discuss briefly in  [ sec : summ ] some implications of these findings in the broader context of the existence of chemical peculiarities in planet hosts in comparison with stars without detected planets .    from the measurements in this section we conclude that the above results are consistent with the notion that neither star is very young ( @xmath79 12 gyr ) , that is likely to be of intermediate age ( @xmath163  gyr ) , and that appears older and more evolved .",
    "using the radial velocities presented in  [ sec : rvs ] we have updated the orbital solution given by @xcite , adopting the improved ephemeris described below in  [ ttv ] .",
    "a keplerian circular orbit was adjusted to the data , and the results may be seen in table  [ tab : par_tres3 ] and are shown graphically in figure  [ specorb_tres3_4 ] . as found also by @xcite , the solution gives a scatter that is larger than expected from the internal velocity errors .",
    "this is most likely due to velocity `` jitter '' associated with chromospheric activity . if we model this as excess scatter to be added quadratically to the internal errors , we find that the amount of jitter required to produce a reduced @xmath80 value near unity is @xmath1618.5  @xmath81 .",
    "external estimates of the jitter for can be made on the basis of the spectral type , the measured value of @xmath82  @xmath29 , and the activity index @xmath83 , and vary considerably but generally range from about 5 to 20  @xmath81@xcite .",
    "these estimates are thus consistent with our findings . nevertheless , as a test we also modeled the data with an eccentric orbit but did not obtain much improvement , and the result for the eccentricity was not significantly different from zero ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "in particular , these do not appear to be significantly affected by the specific choice of the ld law , while fixing the ld coefficients to their theoretical values seems to result in significantly smaller uncertainties in the fitted parameters with respect to the case in which the ld coefficients are also adjusted during the fitting procedure .",
    "the above results were obtained keeping all ld coefficients fixed .",
    "we decided to investigate the effect of fitting for the ld coefficients in the following way .",

    "the results for the system parameters in this case were @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 . for",
    ", we obtained @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .    in both cases ,",
    "the agreement between the system parameters derived keeping the ld coefficients fixed and those when the ld coefficients are part of the solution was excellent , with only a slight increase in the estimated uncertainties for the latter case . indeed , as already noted by @xcite , fixing the ld coefficients at their theoretically predicted values does not appear to significantly bias the results .",
    "however , in the interest of providing more conservative error estimates , we believe that , for the purpose of the analysis of high - quality light - curves such as the ones presented in this paper , a procedure that treats ld coefficients as adjustable parameters is preferable . based on the above considerations , for both and we elected to include in table  [ tab : par_tres3 ] and table  [ tab : par_tres4 ] the values of the systems parameters obtained from the light - curve analysis in the case in which the linear ld coefficient was allowed to float .",
    "we note that this approach provides a departure from the @xcite analysis .",
    "the revised spectroscopic determinations of @xmath37 and [ fe / h ] , along with the new spectroscopic orbital solution for and the light curve fits presented above , allow us to refine the determination of the stellar and planetary properties for both systems . to establish the properties of the parent stars we rely on stellar evolution models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we make explicit use of the constraint on the stellar density provided by the light - curve quantity @xmath135 , as described by @xcite .",
    "the procedure follows closely that given in the previous citation .",
    "briefly , we seek the best match ( in a @xmath80 sense ) between the measured \\{@xmath37 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath135 } and points on a finely interpolated grid of isochrones spanning a wide range of metallicities and ages .",
    "two minor improvements in this procedure , described in more detail by @xcite , have to do with the weighting of each point sampled along the isochrones according to the distance in @xmath37-[fe / h]-@xmath135 space compared to the observed values , and an additional weighting according to the likelihood that the star is in a particular evolutionary state .",
    "the latter effect is accounted for by multiplying the first weight by the expected number density of stars at each location in the h - r diagram , according to an adopted initial mass function ( which in this case is simply a power law with a salpeter index ) .",
    "the impact of these weighting factors is generally minor .",
    "the results for the stellar properties of and are presented in table[star_tres3 ] and table[star_tres4 ] . the distance estimate to accounts for interstellar extinction ( @xmath136 mag ) , as described in ",
    "[ sec : phot_teff ] .",
    "for both stars the surface gravity inferred from the models is typically much more accurate than the spectroscopic gravity determination , showing the power of the constraint on the luminosity and size of the star afforded by @xmath135 .",
    "the results for both and supersede those given recently by @xcite because of the new photometry and radial velocities contributed here in the former case , and the new light - curve solutions for both systems .",
    "the evolutionary ages for the two stars are qualitatively consistent with our conclusions from  [ sec : age ] , but are somewhat more uncertain in the case of . finally , using the distance estimates inferred in this work , the ucac2 proper motion components  @xcite reported by  @xcite and  @xcite , and the mean radial velocity values @xmath137",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath138  @xmath29 as measured with the cfa digital speedometers , we obtain galactic space motion vectors [ @xmath139 , @xmath19 , @xmath140 = [ + 27.3 , + 6.7 , + 33.0 ]  @xmath29 and [ @xmath139 , @xmath19 , @xmath140 = [ @xmath14143.9 , @xmath14139.1 , @xmath1416.9 ]  @xmath29 for and , respectively ( where @xmath139 is taken to be positive toward the galactic anticenter ) .",
    "we collect these results along with the other properties derived previously in table  [ star_tres3 ] and table  [ star_tres4 ] .",
    "the planet parameters follow from the stellar properties and the results of the transit light curve and spectroscopic orbits , and are presented in table[tab : par_tres3 ] and table[tab : par_tres4 ] . for , our planetary mass and radius are significantly larger compared with the determinations in the discovery paper and in @xcite .",
    "this is due in part to the increased mass and radius for the parent star , but also to the larger radius ratio based on the new photometry .",
    "our detailed spectroscopic analyses of and have yielded accurate values of the atmospheric properties ( @xmath24 and [ fe / h ] ) , which are critical for establishing the fundamental properties of the hosts . the accuracy of the temperatures is supported by a number of independent checks ( low - resolution spectroscopy , line - depth ratios , h@xmath50 line profiles , color - temperature calibrations ) that gives us confidence that the inferred stellar properties are reliable .",
    "we find that is a main - sequence g dwarf with a metallicity about 1.5 times lower than the sun s , not a very common occurence among exoplanets hosts .",
    "is a somewhat evolved late f star that is nearing the end of its main - sequence phase , and is slightly enhanced in its iron content with respect to the solar abundance .",
    "the agreement we find between age indicators for and based on measurements of the activity levels , the lithium abundances , and rotation , and the evolutionary age inferred from the models is fair , although , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : age ] , the reliability of empirical age estimates for stars that are not young ( @xmath142 gyr ) is somewhat questionable .",
    "the model estimates themselves are not without their problems .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude the stars are 13 gyr old .",
    "neither star stands out as peculiar when compared with other planet hosts with similar physical properties . in the small @xmath46 value and the fact that we can only place an upper limit on the li abundance",
    "are consistent with the notion that planet hosts with @xmath24 similar to the sun appear to rotate more slowly and are more li - depleted than stars without detected planets . as pointed out recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , this evidence suggests that a planet - forming disk may induce additional rotational braking , leading to enhanced mixing in the stellar envelope , which in turn accelerates the destruction of lithium .",
    ", on the other hand , does not seem consistent with the claim by @xcite that hotter planet hosts with @xmath143  k have higher li abundances , possibly due to self - enrichment processes .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind , however , that these discrepancies may not be significant given the large spread in the li abundance for field stars with the temperature and mass of ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "new investigations on these issues are clearly needed based on uniform analyses of large samples of planet hosts and statistically significant , well - defined control samples of stars without detected planets .",
    "new radial - velocity measurements for presented here have enabled us to revise the spectroscopic orbit for that system .",
    "we detect no indication of any longer - term variations in the radial velocities that might suggest the presence of another body in the system .",
    "however , the small number of observations and their limited time span of only 6 months emphasize the need for continued doppler monitoring of this and other transiting planet systems to investigate the possibility of additional companions . in stark contrast to the considerable ground - based and space - based efforts invested in studying in great detail the atmospheric properties of many of these objects , which have undoubtedly led to tremendous insights into their structure , formation , and evolution , the amount of radial - velocity data available for transiting planets is meager , and often does not go beyond the handful of observations published in the discovery papers .",
    "interest in the radial velocities seems to be quickly lost .",
    "it should be pointed out that the frequency of close - in giant planets ( @xmath144 day ) with additional massive planets in outer orbits ( up to the detection limit of today s doppler surveys , @xmath145 au ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is about 12% ( 8 out of 70 systems discovered via rv methods ) , and it would therefore be wise to continue the velocity monitoring of some of the transiting systems .",
    "if additional planets in a transiting system were detected , they might also be found to undergo transits , and such a discovery would allow us to constrain structural models for gas giants akin to jupiter or saturn , and open exciting opportunities for additional investigations with present ( _ spitzer _ ) and upcoming ( jwst ) space - borne observatories .    accurate stellar properties for and have been derived here following the approach described in @xcite and @xcite , comparing the spectroscopically determined @xmath24 and [ fe / h ] values along with the photometrically measured @xmath6 with current stellar evolution models .",
    "these properties have in turn allowed us to refine the determination of the mass and radius of the planets .",
    "in particular , we confirm that is the planet with the largest radius among the currently known transiting hot jupiters .",
    "recently , winn et al . ( 2008a ) derived upper limits on the albedo of tres-3 based on the nondetection of occultations observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "our findings are relevant to this study in two ways .",
    "firstly , they strengthen the case for a circular orbit , which is important because if the orbit is eccentric then it would be possible that winn et al .",
    "( 2008a ) did not observe tres-3 at the actual times of occultations and that their data place no constraint on the albedo .",
    "secondly , our revised light - curve parameters are relevant because the upper limit on the geometric albedo ( @xmath146 ) was inferred from the measured upper limit on the planet - to - star flux ratio ( @xmath147 ) according to      our revised value of @xmath149 therefore leads to revised upper limits on the geometric albedo of tres-3 .",
    "however , this revision turns out to be minor : the new value of @xmath149 is only 1.5% larger than the value used by winn et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "the upper limits on the geometric albedo become weaker by about 3% . at 99% confidence ,",
    "the revised upper limits are 0.31 , 0.64 , and 1.10 in @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152band , respectively .",
    "there is a large spread in the observed radii and densities for transiting planets of comparable mass placed at similar orbital distance from stars of very similar properties ( @xmath24 , @xmath15 , [ fe / h ] , and age ) .",
    "for example , if we consider along with 5 other transiting planet hosts ( excluding ) with similar characteristics ( hd  149026 , hd  209458 , ogle - tr-56 , ogle - tr-132 , and wasp-1 ) , the nominal masses of the attending planets vary by a factor of @xmath153 , but reported densities vary by a factor of @xmath154 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many theoretical mechanisms have been proposed to inflate the radius of a strongly irradiated planet , such as additional sources of internal heating due to stellar insolation @xcite , tidal heating due to non - zero eccentricity caused by gravitational interaction with an outer companion @xcite or by rotational obliquity @xcite , elevated interior opacity due to enhanced atmospheric metallicity @xcite , or varying core masses @xcite .",
    "none of these appear capable of explaining the observed spread in density in a natural way ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    of the 6 stars",
    "just mentioned , all are more metal - rich than the sun , except for hd  209458 , which has [ fe / h ] close to solar .",
    "some of the above models @xcite predict a positive correlation between the inferred planetary core mass and the host star s metallicity , as in the framework of the core - accretion model of giant planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this idea assumes [ fe / h ] closely tracks the metallicity of the protoplanetary disk , so that more metal - rich stars should be orbited by more metal - rich planets , with a larger heavy - element content .",
    "however , among these 6 systems only one planet ( hd  149026b ) has an inferred core mass significantly larger than zero , and four of the other planets have measured radii so large that the cores are likely to be insignificant .",
    "in fact , even in the absence of a core the observed radii can not be reproduced by the models , with being the extreme case .",
    "interestingly , over 40% of the transiting planets reported in table  5 of @xcite do not appear to require any core at all to explain their sizes ( according to the models of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "taking all this into consideration , the claimed evidence for a core mass  metallicity correlation could indeed be seen as supporting the more widely accepted scenario of formation by core accretion , but from the indications above it may also be that a significant fraction of these objects formed in a different way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    given the evidence collected so far , we suggest that simply connecting the host star s characteristics to the structural properties of transiting planets may in fact be an over - simplification .",
    "we conclude by stressing the importance of refining our understanding of the complex interplay between the disk environment and a forming giant planet , and its evolutionary history after envelope accretion , which might turn out to be more directly responsible for its final structure and composition than the metal content of the parent star .    as gratefully acknowledges the kepler mission for partial support under nasa cooperative agreement ncc 2 - 1390 .",
