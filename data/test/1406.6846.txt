    "there is growing evidence from nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , resonant x - ray scattering and diffraction @xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite that charge ordered states play an important role in underdoped cuprates .",
    "in particular , a charge - modulated state with 4 incommensurate wave vectors along the crystalline axes was detected in ybco and in bi - based single and double layer compounds .",
    "resonant elastic x - ray scattering showed that the charge order emerges just below the opening of the pseudogap @xcite in underdoped bi2201 @xcite .",
    "the formation of the pseudogap , fermi pockets , the appearance of quantum oscillations @xcite and of charge order may thus be intimately related in these systems .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to characterize charge ordered states in interacting systems independently of the strength of the interaction .",
    "furthermore , the implications of point group and time reversal symmetries as well as the hermiticity of the hamiltonian for the order parameter ( op ) will be taken into account in greater detail than in previous treatments .",
    "the microscopic form of the charge op in cuprates is not clear at present . to illustrate this",
    "let us consider the following model hamiltonian for electrons on a square lattice which generally is believed to be relevant for cuprates @xcite , @xmath5 @xmath6 denotes the hopping amplitude of electrons between the lattice site @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath11 spin indices and repeated spin indices are always summed over .",
    "the second and third terms in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) describe antiferromagnetic and coulomb interactions between electrons on neighboring sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 with coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "if double occupancies of sites are excluded eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) represents the well - known @xmath0-@xmath1 model for @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) give rise to two kinds of charge ops . a hartree - like contraction of the third term yields an op proportional to @xmath14 describing the charge on the site @xmath7 .",
    "it may vary from site to site and represents a conventional charge density wave ( cdw ) state .",
    "the exchange contractions of the second and third term in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) yield an op proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nearest neighbor sites .",
    "this state may be called a nonlocal cdw or a bond - order wave ( bow ) state @xcite where the cdw acquires an internal degree of freedom because the electron and hole occupy different sites .",
    "it has been shown that in the large n limit of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( which corresponds to enforcing the constraint of no double occupancies of sites only globally ) the phase diagram consists in the underdoped regime of incommensurate bow states ( at zero doping of the staggered flux phase @xcite as a special case ) @xcite . at the same time the conventional cdw op is zero showing that both kinds of charge order are independent from each other .",
    "more recently the bow state has been studied theoretically in more detail @xcite .",
    "also models with more than one band @xcite or more complex ops @xcite have been considered .",
    "recently a microscopic form for the op in underdoped ybco and bi2201 was proposed @xcite based on experimental data from resonant x - ray scattering .    throughout the paper",
    "we will assume that the temperature is below the transition temperature to the bow state .",
    "the ops are then in general nonzero and their symmetry properties can be studied .",
    "we will classify possible ops for bow states by exploiting point - group and time reversal symmetries as well as the hermiticity of @xmath16 . in the appendix",
    "it is shown that possible ops for the ground state are basis functions for representations of @xmath17 .",
    "if the ground state is non - degenerate in the sense that it does not contain two linearly independent ops the representation is irreducible . if the ground state is degenerate and satifies a two dimensional representation this representation may be irreducible or reducible . in the latter case",
    "it is composed of two ops with different symmetries and the degeneracy is not a consequence of symmetry but of coupling constants . in the following",
    "we will confine our discussion to ops which form irreducible representations of @xmath17 and exlude accidential degeneracies , additional instabilities or induced higher harmonics @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for the ops will be given for bow states with four wave vectors of the form @xmath18 and the form @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "from eq . ( [ h ] ) follows that the bow op has the form of a coupling constant times the matrix element @xmath21 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nearest neighbors . to simplify the nomenclature we will call the modulated part of @xmath21 op in the following . after a fourier",
    "transform we obtain , @xmath22 @xmath23 is the vector from the origin to the lattice site @xmath7 .",

    "( [ f ] ) and represent our set of order parameters . if umklapp terms are included the sum over @xmath30 may not only include primary instability vectors of the normal state but higher harmonics with wave vectors @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an integer .",
    "they form new stars and cause deviations from the plane - wave limit of the op . because these higher harmonics are important only near the transition to the commensurate phase we will neglect them in the following and restrict ourselves to the plane - wave limit .",
    "the symmetry group of the square lattice is @xmath17 . using the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite let us denote one of the 8 symmetry transformations by @xmath33 .",
    "its action on the order parameter in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the 2x2 matrix representing @xmath33 in the two - dimensional direct space .",
    "after a fourier transformation with respect to @xmath23 we find that @xmath29 transforms under @xmath33 into @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 belong to the star of wave vectors and to nearest neighbor bonds , respectively .",
    "this means that the set of functions @xmath39 forms basis functions for a ( reducible ) representation of @xmath17 . decomposing this reducible representation into irreducible parts the basis function of one of the irreducible representations describes the op of the state corresponding to the global minimum of the free energy .",
    "one important feature is that in general both @xmath30 and @xmath27 are transformed under @xmath33 at the same time and not independently from each other .",
    "this is a crucial point in our approach .",
    "further general properties of the functions @xmath40 are related to time reversal and the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "the operator @xmath41 for time reversal is defined in real space by @xmath42 where the star means conjugate complex .",

    "@xcite applying the frobenius - schur test @xcite to the point group @xmath17 shows that including @xmath41 in the set of symmetry transformations can not produce additional degeneracies of irreducible representations .",
    "thus it is convenient to construct first basis functions for irreducible representations of the point group and then to check their behavior under time reversal .",
    "in the following we will first consider the case with 4 wave vectors along the diagonals , i.e. , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 lies between 0 and @xmath54 .",
    "the four bond directions are denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to see that the following 8 functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 yield a reducible representation of @xmath17 .",

    "considering @xmath17 and applying its n=8 transformations @xmath212 to @xmath211 we denote by @xmath213 the transformations which lead to linearly independent functions @xmath214 .",
    "the functions @xmath215 can be written as linear combinations of the functions @xmath216 . denoting the n point group operators by @xmath217 , we can write @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a matrix with d rows and n columns . applying @xmath220 to @xmath216 gives @xmath221 @xmath222 denotes the column of @xmath223 which corresponds to the point group transformation @xmath224 . for",

    "( [ an1 ] ) and ( [ an2 ] ) establish that the matrices @xmath226 together with the basis functions @xmath216 form a representation of @xmath17 .    assuming that no accidential degeneracy of the ground state is present the set of functions @xmath233 form a basis for the degenerate ops of the ground state .",
    "if @xmath234 there is only one linearly independent op describing the ground state .",
    "moreover , this op must form a basis function for a one - dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath17 .",
    "thus if the ground state is non - degenerate its op must be one of the basis functions belonging to irreducible one - dimensional representations discussed in sections iii and iv .",
    "in the case @xmath235 there are two linearly independent ops describing the degenerate ground state .",
    "they form a two - dimensional representation of @xmath17 .",
    "the two basis functions have the same free energy because they transform into each other by symmetry operations of the point group . determining the trace of the associated representation matrices",
    "@xmath236 there are two cases possible .",
    "the representation is irreducible and the two basis functions transform according to the @xmath4 representation . or , the representation is reducible and a superposition of two different one - dimensional representations . in this case",
    "the free energy of the two - dimensional reducible representation may be lower or higher than that of the irreducible representations .",
    "this means that the case is not excluded that a two - fold degenerate ground state transforms according to a reducible and not an irreducible representation .    in order to illustrate the above statements we consider a simple free energy model without bond degrees of freedom and two real ops , @xmath237 @xmath238 @xmath239 and @xmath240 are wave vectors of equal length along the @xmath241 and @xmath242 axis , respectively . forming the combinations @xmath243",

    "note that the prefactor @xmath249 is the same for both order parameters though the latter have different symmetries . in the usual terminology",
    "this corresponds to an accidential degeneracy . in our case",
    "this degeneracy is caused by the fact that the diverging susceptibilities in the normal state at @xmath252 and @xmath253 are related by point group operations .",
    "there is only one @xmath251 for both symmetries @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "below @xmath251 the ops @xmath244 and @xmath245 will become finite and in general be also different due to the anharmonic terms in @xmath104 .    solving the extremal equations for @xmath104 yields the following solutions : @xmath254 @xmath255 @xmath256 the free energy eq .",

    "it is convenient to take this degeneracy tacitly into account and to consider only half of the above solutions .",
    "calculating also the corresponding free energies we find that ( a ) represents a basis function @xmath245 of length @xmath260 for a @xmath3 representation with energy @xmath261 .",
    "similarly , ( b ) represents a basis function of length @xmath262 for a @xmath2 representation with energy @xmath263 .",

    "the two basis functions yield a reducible two - dimensional representation containing both @xmath2 and @xmath3 symmetries .",

    "2 is always below 1 .",
    "thus the solution ( a ) has in this region the lowest free energy and describes the stable state .",
    "it is non - degenerate and its basis function belongs to an irreducible representation of @xmath3 symmetry . for @xmath273 the curve in fig .",
    "2 is larger or equal to one . as a result solution ( c ) has the lowest free energy in this interval and describes a degenerate ground state .",
    "it is given by a two - dimensional reducible representation which consists both of @xmath2 and @xmath3 components .",
    "our calculation shows that this two - dimensional reducible representation may have a lower free energy than the @xmath2 and @xmath3 components .",
    "our calculation also demonstrates that the same basis functions may describe a degenerate or a non - degenerate ground state depending on the values of the coupling constants .",
    "this means that the degeneracy of a ground state described by a reducible two - dimensional representation is not enforced by symmetry as in the case of irreducible representations but depends in general on the values of the coupling constants .",
