    "successful development of the van der waals ( vdw ) heterostructures  @xcite based on stacking of two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals and graphene layers ( gls ) promises a significant progress in infrared ( ir ) and terahertz ( thz ) optoelectronics  @xcite .",
    "the unique properties of gls provide an opportunity to create new effective photodetectors operating in a wide range of photon energies   @xcite . supplementing their design by the band structure engineering using 2d - materials for the barrier layers opens up new prospects in further enhancement of the detector performance . recently ,",
    "new ir and thz detectors using gl - vdw heterostructures were proposed and evaluated : + ( i ) thz photodetectors based on a double - gl structure , in which the _ intraband _ inter - gl resonant transitions are assisted by ir or thz photons  @xcite .",
    "the resonant nature of such transitions , in which the electron momentum is conserved  @xcite , promotes their elevated probability and , hence , the elevated quantum efficiency .",
    "these photodetectors require inclined radiation incidence or a radiation coupler ( grating structure ) ; + ( ii ) thz and ir photodetectors based on the gl - vdw heterostructures using the photon - assisted _ interband _ transitions between the neighboring gls  @xcite ; + ( iii ) thz detectors based on the gl - vdw heterostructures operating as hot - electron bolometers using the effect of the emission from gls of the electrons , heated by the thz radiation , due to the _ intraband _ ( drude ) absorptions in gls  @xcite .        in this paper , we propose and evaluate the ir photodetectors based on the gl - vdw heterostructures with different numbers of the active undoped gls placed between the emitter and collector and separated by the inter - gl barriers ( glips ) .",
    "these photodetectors are using the _ interband _ photoexcitation of the electrons in gls from the valence band states to the exited states slightly below or higher than the barrier edge . the photoexcited electrons transfer ( by tunneling through the barrier top or directly ) to the continuum states above the barrier and propagate through the barrier layers .",
    "the gl - vdw double - gl photoconductive device with the emitter and collector gls separated by the barrier and using a similar mechanism was recently proposed  @xcite fabricated and measured  @xcite . however , as we demonstrate below , the insertion of the inner gls , which provides the extra electron photoemission and capture , can lead to a dramatic increase in the glip responsivity .",
    "this is due to the photocurrent gain associated with the redistribution of the electric field in the heterostructure and leading to amplification of the electron injection from the emitter .",
    "thus the glips in some sense resemble quantum - well infrared photodetectors ( qwips ) typically using iii - v materials and extensively studied , fabricated , and used in applications during two decades  @xcite .",
    "such a similarity is due to the propagation of the photoexcited electrons over the barriers with their fraction being captured back to the bound states ( in gls and qws , respectively ) . a relatively low capture probability results in the elevated values of the detector responsivity .",
    "apart from this , in both glips and qwips the detector detectivity increases with an increasing number of gls and qws ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference between the glips and qwips is in the use of the interband ( in glips ) and intraband ( in qwips ) transitions .",
    "this allows eliminating the grating structures required in the n - qwips for radiation coupling . in realistic glips with a relatively large conduction band off - set",
    ", the proper electron photoexcitation requires higher photon energies @xmath0 than in qwips .",
    "this implies that the glips might generally operate at shorter radiation wavelengths than the qwips .",
    "however , modifying the shape of the barriers by doping of the inter - gl layers , one can achieve an effective electron photoescape at fairly low photon energies ( in far - ir range ) . as shown in  @xcite",
    ", the probability of the electron capture into the gls can be much smaller than that for the qws  ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) since doping of the qws in the qwips leads to the inclusion of the electron - electron scattering mechanism of the capture .",
    "smaller capture efficiency is beneficial for a higher detector responsivity  @xcite ( see also ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of the gl doping promotes lower electron emission of the thermalized electrons than that in the doped qws and , hence , leads to a smaller dark current . finally , the probability of the electron photoexcitation from the gls is substantially higher than from the qws .",
    "these glip features ( the sensitivity to the normally incident radiation and higher photoexcitation and lower capture probabilities ) provide potential advantages of the glips over the qwips and some other photodetectors .",
    "the photodetectors based on gl - vdw heterostructures with the tunneling transparent inter - gl barrier layers considered recently  @xcite and the glips with relatively thick layers studied in the present paper are analogous .",
    "however their operation principles are quite different : the photo - stimulated cascade tunneling between gls in  @xcite and the photoexcitation of electrons to the continuum states and propagation in glips . in the latter device , only a small fraction of the propagating electrons can be captured to the gls .",
    "such a distinction results in different spectral properties and other detector characteristics . in particular , in the glips under consideration ,",
    "the photoexcitation probability can be much larger than the probability of the inter - gl photo - stimulated transfer .",
    "this is due to the diminished wave function overlap in the neighboring gls  @xcite .",
    "apart from this , the glips considered here and the hot - electron glips using the bolometric mechanism  @xcite are characterized by a rather low capture probability of electrons in the continuum states  @xcite .",
    "this promotes high values of the detector responsivity  @xcite this is in contrast with the detection mechanism associated with the cascade inter - gl photo - stimulated tunneling .",
    "the spectral ranges of the photodetectors using the inter - gl photo - stimulated cascade transfer  20 and the electron heating  @xcite from one side and the spectral range of the glip operation can be essentially different .",
    "one important feature of the glips is that their operation do not require the mutual alignment of the gls .",
    "various device models used for studies of the vertical electron transport in qws ( and gls ) introduce the concept of an `` ideal '' emitter ( which provides as many injected electrons as the bulk of the structure `` requires '' ) . in the framework of this concept ,",
    "the electric - field distributions are assumed to be uniform . a more accurate consideration of the transport phenomena in such structures ( including glips ) in the dark conditions and under irradiation accounts for the self - consistent electric field distributions and the nonideality of the emitter  @xcite .",
    "this paper uses this more accurate approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe the possible glip device structures and the glip operation principle .",
    "section  3 deals with the device mathematical model .",
    "the latter includes the equation for the self - consistent electric potential and the equations governing the electron balance in the gls . in the latter equation , the electron capture into the gls is described phenomenologically invoking the concept of the capture parameter  @xcite ( see , also ,  @xcite . in section  4 , we derive the dark current in the glips as a function of the structural parameters and the applied voltage using the model described in sec .  3 . in section  5",
    ", we calculate the photocurrent ( the variation of the current under the incident radiation ) . the expressions obtained in sections  4 and 5 are then used in sec .  6 for the derivation of the glip detector responsivity , photoelectric gain , and detectivity . in section  6",
    ", we compare the glips with some other ir photodetectors . in the conclusion section ,",
    "we draw the main results of the paper . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss some simplifications of the main model .",
    "we consider the glips based on the gl heterostructure which consists of the @xmath1 inner gls clad between the @xmath2 barrier layers with the top and bottom contact gls .",
    "the conduction band offsets between the emitter gl and the barrier layer , @xmath3 , as well as between the inner gls and the barrier layers between them , @xmath4 , are smaller than the pertinent offsets in the valence band .",
    "generally , the materials of the emitter barrier layer and of other barrier layers can be different , so that @xmath5 .    the top and bottom gls",
    "are assumed to be doped to provide their sufficiently high lateral conductivity .",
    "these extreme gls serve as the tunneling emitter ( injecting electrons into the gl - heterostructure bulk ) and the collector , respectively .",
    "the top and bottom gls are supplied with contacts between which the bias voltage @xmath6 is applied .",
    "we consider the gl heterostructures with either the n - type or p - type doping of both the emitter and collector gls and undoped inner gls and the barrier layers , i.e. , the heterostructures with different types of the emitter and collector can also be treated in the framework of our model .",
    "the applied voltage in such heterostructures , stimulates the electron tunneling through the barriers with triangular tops .",
    "the thermalized electrons tunneling from the gls and the electrons excited by the incident ir radiation propagate over the barriers .",
    "figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) show schematically the glips based on gl - vdw heterostructures considered in  @xcite and their band diagrams .",
    "figure 1(c ) corresponds to the glips with the bound - to - continuum tunneling and photon - assisted transitions considered in the present work .",
    "figure  2 shows the band diagrams of the glip ( with the structure of figure  1(c ) ) using the interband intra - gl photoexcitation with the sequential tunneling of the photoexcited electrons ( a ) in dark conditions and ( b ) under the strong ir irradiation at the sufficiently high bias voltage ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the electron charge and @xmath9 is the temperature in the energy units ) .",
    "the applied voltage induces the extra carriers of the opposite signs and changes the electron fermi energies in the emitter and collector gls .",
    "the electron fermi energies , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in these gls ( at their equal doping ) are different : @xmath12 and @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the fermi energy in the extreme gls at their donor ( upper sign for the n - type contact gls ) or acceptor ( for the p - type contact gls ) density equal to @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the planck constant , @xmath17  cm / s is the electron and hole velocity in gls , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the bias voltage can to some extent affect the emitter injection characteristics decreasing the electron activation energy in the emitter @xmath20 ( see the appendix ) .    to enhance the electron collection by the collector",
    ", the bottom gl can be replaced by a doped multiple - gl or by a thick wider band - gap doped collector region . in principle , the glips with the n - type emitters can be supplied with p - type collectors and vice versa .",
    "the operation of the glips with the device structure and the band diagrams corresponding to figures  1(c ) and 2 considered below is associated with the following .",
    "the incoming ir photons generate the electron - hole pairs ( due to the photon absorption and the vertical interband transitions ) in each gl . depending on the ratio @xmath21 $ ] , the photogenerated electrons appear in the continuum states above the barriers directly ( if @xmath22 ) or via the intermediate excited state with the energy @xmath23 with respect to the dirac point following the electron tunneling through the triangular barrier top  @xcite [ see figure  2(b ) ] . upon the photoexcitation to the states over the barriers ,",
    "the electrons propagate toward the collector . during the electron transport over the barrier ,",
    "a fraction of the propagating electrons is captured into the gls .",
    "since we consider devices with the barriers , in which the conduction band off - set @xmath4 and the quantity @xmath24 are smaller than the valence band off - set , the escape of the photogenerated holes from the gls can be neglected .",
    "the glip barriers in the devices under consideration can be made of the van der waals structures with the inse , ws@xmath25 , and other barrier layer materials  @xcite .",
    "the poisson equation governing the electric potential distribution @xmath26 in the direction perpendicular to the gl plane ( the @xmath27direction ) and the equations governing the electron balance in each gl at the steady - state irradiation are presented in the following form :    @xmath28    @xmath29    here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the 2d densities of electrons and holes in the inner gls with the index @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 corresponding to the emitter and collector gls , respectively ) , @xmath35 is the density of the electron current across gls , @xmath36 is the capture efficiency for the electrons crossing the @xmath37gl  @xcite , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the rates of the tunneling emission of the thermalized electrons and the tunneling emission of the electrons photoexcited ( photogenerated ) from the gl valence band in the @xmath37th gl , @xmath40 is the probability of the interband photon absorption in gls , ( @xmath41 is the fine structure constant , where @xmath42 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath43 is the barrier material refraction index ) , @xmath44 is the probability of the photoexcited electrons tunneling escape from the @xmath37th gl to the continuum states above the inter - gl barriers , @xmath45 is the ir radiation intensity ( photon flux inside the heterostructure ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the thickness of the inter - gl barrier layer and its dielectric constant , respectively , and @xmath48 is the dirac delta function ( which reflects narrow localization of the electron and hole charges in the gls ) , in contrast to qwips using the intraband transitions , the photoexcitation rate in glips is virtually independent of @xmath49 . both thermalized electron tunneling rate @xmath38 and the escape probability of the photoexcited electrons @xmath44 from the @xmath50-th gl ( and , hence , the photoemission rate ) can markedly , namely , exponentially increase with the electric field in the barrier under this gl @xmath51 .",
    "the escape probability of the photoexcited electrons is also determined by the effective energy of the photoexcited electron @xmath52 .",
    "although the parameter @xmath36 characterizing the capture into the @xmath50-th gl depends , to some extent , on the local electric field , this dependence is much weaker than the field - dependence of the tunneling from the gls . in reality , @xmath36 is most likely to be a functional of the electric - field spatial distribution  @xcite .",

    "the comparison of glips and qwips ( based , in particular , on ingaas / algaas and other heterostructures with the n - type qws ) intended for the operation in mid- and near ir ranges , shows that glips can exhibit the following advantages : ( i ) sensitivity to normally incident radiation ( no radiations coupling structures are needed ; ( ii ) higher probability of the photo - assisted escape from the gl bound states to the continuum states above the barriers due to a relatively large universal constant @xmath222 .",
    "( compare with @xmath223 for a gaas qw with the typical electron density @xmath224  @xmath225  @xcite ) ; smaller capture efficiency of the electrons propagating over the barriers the into the gls ( up to the orders of magnitude - compare the data from  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "these advantages imply that the glip responsivity can exceed that of qwips .",
    "since the modulation bandwidths of both glip and qwips is determined by the vertical electron transport across the barrier layers , one might assume that these bandwidths are can close to each other .",
    "as follows from equation  ( 21 ) and equation  ( 4 ) from  @xcite , the responsivity , @xmath201 , of a glip and the responsivity , @xmath226 of a lateral gl - photodiode ( glpd ) with a lateral p - i - n junction , are ( at @xmath75 ) approximately equal to    @xmath227    respectively .",
    "hence ,    @xmath228    since , the capture efficiency @xmath56 can be very small , the above ratio can exceed unity .",

    "the glip , double - gl glip , and utc - pd response at relatively high modulation frequency is affected by the electron transit across this region .",
    "one can assume that the electron transit time in utc - pds can be somewhat shorter than in the glips because of better transport properties of the drift region materials in the former devices .",
    "however , the delay in the escape of the photoexcited electrons from the emitter limited by their diffusion ( or in the best case , by the drift in the built - in electric field ) across the heavily doped emitter layer , can be the main factor limiting the utc - pd modulation bandwidths .",
    "this implies that the glips ( without such a delay in the emitter gl ) can exhibit a high - speed performance close to that of the utc - pds and , hence , compete with the latter .",

    "the glips exploit the interband electron transitions between the valence band in the gls and the continuum states in the conduction band of the barrier materials .",
    "the glips should be able to operate in different ranges of the ir spectrum depending on the values of the conduction band offset between the gl and the barrier layer material .",
    "we showed that due to small capture probability of the excited electrons into the gls together with a relatively strong interband photon absorption , the glips can exhibit elevated photoelectric gain and responsivity .",
    "an increase in the number of gls in the glip heterostructure can provide relatively high values of the glip detectivity . among other glip advantages",

    "we set the escape frequency equal to @xmath231 and @xmath232 for the thermalized and photoexcited electrons respectively .",

    "the fit is not so ideal but can be considered as reasonable somewhat affecting the shape of the glip spectral characteristics only at @xmath219 .",
    "the inverse relaxation time assumed to be primarily determined by the electron - electron scattering , so @xmath239 as functions of @xmath69 in the undoped gls ( @xmath62 ) and doped emitter gl ( @xmath240  mev ) at @xmath241 and @xmath91  k are gls shown in figure  7 by the dotted lines .",
    "these curves were obtained by calculating the imaginary part of the electron rpa self - energy  @xcite . as follows from figure  7 , in the most interesting actual range of @xmath242 the order - of magnitude estimates yields @xmath243  s and @xmath244 .",
    "the latter characteristic times are markedly smaller that the characteristic time of the spontaneous emission of optical phonons @xmath83 for both the intraband and interband electron transitions .",

    "it is worth mention that if the capture efficiency @xmath36 is a sufficiently strong function of @xmath249 , the monotonic electric - field spatial distributions can become unstable against the perturbation with the length @xmath250",
    "@xcite . such an instability can lead to quasi - chaotic spatio - temporal electric field variations , which eventually result in the formation of stable quasi - periodic electric - field distributions  @xcite .",
    "the electric field in the emitter barrier induces extra electrons in the emitter gl and , hence , leads to an enhancement in the electron fermi level or the hole fermi level if this gl is donor or acceptor doped , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the parameter @xmath165 can markedly depend on @xmath173 ( decreasing with increasing @xmath173 ) somewhat affecting the current - voltage characteristics .",

    "thus , at not too large voltages and emitter electric fields , the injection ( from the contact ) of the extra electrons in the emitter gl does not affect the shape of the current - voltage characteristics , but leads to a replacement of the quantity @xmath61 by @xmath264 .",
    "if the emitter barrier layer has the thickness @xmath265 different from @xmath46 , equation ( 6 ) should be modified .",
    "the ir irradiation can somewhat reinforce the thermionic electron emission from the emitter gl due to heating high - density 2d electron plasma in the doped emitter gl ( see  @xcite ; this effect was disregarded in section 5 ) .",
    "the electron photoexcitation can lead to a heating of the carriers in the emitter gl slightly modifying the injection properties of the emitter .",
    "however , in the regimes considered above , the emitter properties weakly affect the glip characteristics , particularly , for the multiple gl devices  ( @xmath266 ) . this mechanism as well as the photoemission from the emitter gl can be crucial for the double - gl glips without the inner gls ( i.e. , with n=0 )  @xcite .",
    "the operation principle of the double - gl glips is similar to that used in the uni - travelling - carrier photodiodes ( utc - pds )  @xcite .",
    "but such glips , being potentially interesting , do not exhibit the effect of photoelectric gain , which can substantially increase the responsivity .",
    "the bolometric mechanism associated with the electron heating due to the drude absorption can be efficient at the relatively low radiation frequencies in the gl devices with all of the gls doped  @xcite ( not considered here ) .      the evaluation of the glip dynamic response to transient ir radiation requires a substantial generalization of our model .",
    "it will be done elsewhere .",
    "here we refrain to a qualitative reasoning .",
    "the dynamic operation of the glips under consideration is determined by following characteristic times : the electron transit time across the glip @xmath267 , the time of the gls charging by the injected current due to the electron capture @xmath268 and the time of emptying of the gls by the electron photoexcitation from the gls @xmath269 .",
    "the transit time can be estimated as @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the average electron velocity across the barrier layers .",
    "the latter can be set to be equal to the electron saturation velocity @xmath272 .",
    "the characteristic times @xmath268 and @xmath269 decrease with an increasing dc component of the incident ir radiation intensity . at small capture parameters , even at fairly strong irradiation , @xmath273 .    at the modulation frequencies of the incident ir radiation @xmath274 ,",
    "the glip responsivity is well described by the above formulas [ e.g. , by equation  ( 28 ) ] . in this modulation frequency range ,",
    "the responsivity is about @xmath275 and virtually independent of the number of the gls @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the range @xmath276 , the electron capture does not manage to provide the gl recharging . as a result , the electric field @xmath173 and",
    "the current injected from the emitter gl do not follow the temporal variations of the ir radiation .",
    "this implies that the mechanism of the photoelectric gain is effectively switch - off .",
    "this leads to smaller values of the responsivity , which dependence on both @xmath56 and @xmath1 is rather complex . at higher modulation frequencies @xmath277 , the responsivity markedly drops with increasing frequency @xmath278 . the electron transit time @xmath267 limits the glip modulation bandwidths . setting @xmath279  cm / s and @xmath280  nm",
