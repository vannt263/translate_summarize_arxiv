    "searching for new materials with nontrivial topological properties is a forefront research field of condensed matter physics . following the theoretical prediction and experimental discovery of two - dimensional and three - dimensional topological insulators @xcite ,",
    "the fully - gapped topological insulators and topological superconductors have been classified according to their symmetries @xcite .",
    "one focus of recent research is on a class of materials with discrete degeneracy points in the band structure @xcite .",
    "these dirac and weyl semimetals are analogies or generalizations of graphene , which is a prototypical two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac semimetal @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) weyl semimetals realize the chiral anomaly which results in several novel transport properties , including the anomalous hall effect and the chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "the interest in 3d weyl semimetal is soon extended to 2d dirac and weyl semimetals @xcite and 3d dirac and weyl superconductors @xcite .",
    "the 2d weyl superconductor , which is also a member of this new family of materials characterized by the presence of weyl fermions , has however till now received very little attention .",
    "this is partly because of the difficulty in realizing such a phase . on one hand ,",
    "accidental band degeneracy is known to be very unlikely in 2d @xcite . in a superconductor , at least one particle band and one hole band ( which are related to each other by charge conjugation )",
    "cross each other and thus invert in a certain region of the wave vector space , which makes possible the occurrence of nodal points as the parts of the crossing curve between the particle and hole bands that are not gapped out .",
    "however , by opening a full gap the superconductor can usually gain more condensation energy and so naturally occurring nodal superconductors are rare . on the other hand , the realization of weyl nodes requires non - degenerate fermi surface .",
    "this requires the breaking of at least one of the time - reversal symmetry and the inversion symmetry @xcite . while the former requires the persistence of magnetic order in the superconducting phase , the latter point to noncentrosymmetric materials . in bulk materials ,",
    "the competition with other symmetry breaking tendencies makes the superconducting phase less favored as compared to the simple time - reversal invariant and inversion symmetric materials .",
    "therefore , the 2d weyl superconductor appears to be the most elusive member of the weyl materials .    in this work",
    ", we propose that a 2d weyl superconductor can be created in a very inclusive system , a heterostructure consisting of a half - metal ( hm ) with rashba spin - orbital coupling ( rsoc ) and a spin - singlet superconductor .",
    "the combination of a single nondegenerate fermi surface @xcite , the transmutation between spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairing by the rsoc @xcite , and the possible existence of nodes in the order parameter of the spin - singlet pairing , make the hm layer of the proposed heterostructure a unique platform to realize the 2d weyl superconductor .",
    "an important tunability of the system , sketched in fig.1 , is the orientation of magnetization of the hm .",
    "earlier , the heterostructure with an @xmath1-wave superconductor was found to give a 2d weyl superconductivity phase ( swsc ) when the spontaneous magnetization of the hm lies along a mirror symmetric direction within the film plane @xcite . in the heterostructure with a @xmath0-wave superconductor ( such as the cuprates ) , on the other hand , a 2d weyl superconductor ( dwsc ) is realized for an arbitrary magnetization orientation ( the case with purely out - of - plane magnetization was also studied by sato and fujimoto in a slightly different setting @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk and edge state spectra and their evolution with the magnetization direction show distinct differences from those for the swsc .",
    "for example , besides the type - i weyl nodes which are realized in swsc , we also find type - ii weyl nodes in a dwsc . in weyl",
    "semimetal , type - i and type - ii weyl nodes are defined separately as weyl point with a point - like fermi surface and weyl point appearing at the contact of electron and hole pockets @xcite . here , we define type - i and type - ii weyl nodes in a superconductor analogously .",
    "namely , for type - i weyl node the constant energy surface ( not necessarily the fermi surface ) crossing the weyl point spans a single point , whereas for type - ii weyl node the constant energy surface crossing the weyl point forms an electron - like and a hole - like quasiparticle ` fermi surface ' and connect to each other at the weyl point .",
    "the transition between type - i and type - ii weyl nodes is achieved in a dwsc by varying the direction of the spontaneous magnetization of the hm .",
    "in addition , for a general magnetization orientation , the state studied consists simultaneously of normal and superfluid components . in terms of the zero - energy quasiparticle spectrum",
    ", the varying magnetization orientation drives the system to go through a series of lifshitz transitions , which is usually encountered in a metal in the normal phase @xcite .",
    "it is also shown to be qualitatively different from all known types of pairings , including the bcs pairing @xcite , the fflo pairing @xcite , and the breached pairing state ( sarma phase ) @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the model and parameters for the proposed heterostructure . in sec .",
    "iii , we report the energy spectra of the system .",
    "these include the energy spectra for bulk and a strip of the system , the spectral functions and density of states for the two edges of a strip , the clarification of the nature of proximity - induced superconducting state , and the lifshitz transitions in the quasiparticle spectrum . the transition between type - i and type - ii weyl nodes is also studied in this section .",

    "iv , we study the symmetry and topological properties of the system . in sec .",
    "v , we show the energy spectra for the heterostructure with the hm replaced by an ordinary ferromagnetic material having a partially polarized fermi surface .",

    "in contrast to @xmath30 and @xmath29 which both have well - defined zero - energy edge states , the zero - energy edge states for @xmath31 merge with the bulk weyl nodes and therefore have vanishing weight on the edge . this explains the finite dos at @xmath142 for @xmath30 and @xmath29 @xcite and the vanishing zero - energy dos for @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the edge states for @xmath30 are distorted and have two finite - energy critical points with zero slope [ figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) ] .",
    "they in turn give the two low - energy van hove singularities in fig.6(a ) .",
    "the two low - energy van hove singularities in fig.6(f ) are also related to the presence of finite - energy critical points with zero slope in the edge states , as is clear from figs.5(a ) and 5(b ) .",
    "the second feature is the existence of a critical angle at which the edge states on one edge becomes completely ( the @xmath1-wave case ) or partly ( the two @xmath0-wave cases ) flat . in this aspect ,",
    "the results for @xmath30 are similar to those for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a nearly flat portion in the edge state dispersion shown in figs .",
    "4(d ) and 4(f ) manifest as a prominent zero - energy dos peak in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) . for @xmath31 ,",
    "a portion of the edge state dispersion for one edge also becomes flat at the transition point from the type - i weyl node to the type - ii weyl node , which would also give a zero - energy van hove singularity in the dos . from figs .",
    "3(h ) and 5(e ) , @xmath127 is very close to but slightly smaller than this transition point .",
    "correspondingly , we get in fig.6(h ) a not fully developed zero - energy van hove singularity .",
    "in addition , the van hove singularity for @xmath31 occurs on the opposite edge as compared to those for @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "this is understood from the fact that , for the edge states close to @xmath117 on the same edge ( e.g. , the left edge with @xmath136 ) and at @xmath100 , their velocity for @xmath31 is opposite in sign to those for @xmath30 and @xmath29 .      here , we summarize the main differences between the energy spectra of the heterostructures with @xmath0-wave form factors [ @xmath30 and @xmath31 ] and those for the heterostructure with @xmath1-wave form factor [ @xmath29 ] @xcite .    for the @xmath1-wave case , there are three different phases as we change the direction of the magnetization , the fully - gapped phase , the phase without a full gap but has a ubiquitous local gap , and the swsc phase with a pair of nodes between the two low - energy quasiparticle bands when the magnetization lies along an in - plane direction . for both @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the @xmath0-wave cases ,",

    "finally , in the breached pairing state , the pairing gap between _ two _ bands of unequal fermi momenta opens at nonzero energy . for our system , in the presence of an in - plane component of the exchange field and away from @xmath117 , the pairing gap between the @xmath67 and @xmath66 bands also opens at nonzero energy and is similar to the breached pairing state .",

    "this is relevant since ferromagnetic materials with partially polarized fermi surface is more commonly found than hm .",
    "this problem is also relevant if we turn our attention from the hm layer to the layer of spin - singlet superconductor .",
    "it is clear that the same model can be used to describe this layer .",
    "the only qualitative difference is just in the magnitude of the exchange field , since the proximity - induced exchange field in the @xmath0-wave superconductor is in general not large enough to split completely one spin component off the fermi surface .",
    "consider a ferromagnetic metal with a fermi surface consisting of two sheets with opposite spin - polarization and different volumes .",
    "the two sheets with opposite spin polarizations would naturally be separated from each other . replacing the hm in the heterostructure studied above with such a partially polarized ferromagnet",
    ", we can expect to apply the previous analyses separately to each spin component .",
    "as such , we can expect to get two sets of low - energy effective models with similar properties but related separately to the two spin - split bands .",
    "in particular , for each band , there will be a pair of counter - propagating chiral majorana edge states .",
    "it is then interesting to ask whether or not the two sets of chiral edge modes are always separated from each other . or , in cases where they coexist in some parameter ranges , how would they interact with each other .",

    "( b ) and ( c ) are spectral functions on the left ( @xmath136 ) and right ( @xmath137 ) edges of the strip for @xmath100 .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath94 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 .",
    "the darker the color , the larger the spectral weight.,title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=472 ]    to answer the above question , we have studied the changes in the properties of the weyl superconductivity phase brought by increasing the chemical potential so that it crosses both of the two spin - polarized subbands of the ferromagnet . as shown in fig.9(a ) are the spectral functions for the edge layers ( results for the two edges are the same ) of a strip for @xmath29 and @xmath68 , namely the @xmath1wsc . while on one hand the edge modes for the two spin species keep largely independent of each other , a hybridization gap opens at ( @xmath117 , @xmath142 ) .",
    "besides , because the fermi sheets of the two spin channels open gaps independently , the edge modes in the non - overlapping regions of the pairing gaps of the two pin - split bands will be masked by the bulk states of the opposite - spin band .",
    "overall , the chiral edge modes appear in _ three disconnected _ regions of the local energy gap of the energy spectrum . in fig.10",
    ", we show the spectral functions on the two edges of a strip of the @xmath0wsc at @xmath100 for @xmath30 [ 10(a ) and 10(b ) ] and @xmath31 [ 10(c ) and 10(d ) ] .",
    "the results for @xmath29 at @xmath100 are shown as figs.9(b ) and 9(c ) . for @xmath30 ,",
    "we observe similar coexistence of two chiral edge states and the opening of a hybridization gap at ( @xmath117 , @xmath142 ) between the two edge states belonging separately to the two spin - subbands . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the two copies of edge states simply superimpose together and no hybridization gap opens . in ref.@xcite , it was pointed out that the topological phase with a single majorana edge state can be obtained for vanishingly small exchange field when the chemical potential is at the band bottom ( @xmath219 ) . while that case still has a single band crossing the chemical potential , our present case has two bands contributing to the fermi surface . from the numerical results in fig.10 and comparing it with fig.9 for the @xmath1-wave case , we see that while the edge states exist when the fermi surface consists of two sheets , there is a pair of counter - propagating edge modes on each edge which usually hybridize and open a gap .",
    "the physical picture for the @xmath0-wave case is therefore of no essential difference from the @xmath1-wave case as regards the number of edge states and their hybridization .",
    "since there are even number of edge states on each edge , they are not topologically protected .",
    "this is consistent with the pfaffian @xmath154 invariant defined in eq.(20 ) , which gives the topologically trivial result of @xmath220 for the present set of parameters .",
    "the phase on the superconductor side of the heterostructure is therefore topologically trivial .",
    "topologically nontrivial physics are located in the hm layer .",
    "[ fig10 ]   ( a , b ) and @xmath31 ( c , d ) . the angle is taken as @xmath100 .",
    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath218 .",
    "darker color means larger spectral function.,title=\"fig:\",width=321,height=264 ]",
    "in summary , we have predicted the realization of two - dimensional weyl superconductivity phases in a heterostructure consisting of a half - metal ( or a highly spin - polarized ferromagnet ) clamped in between an insulating substrate and a spin - singlet superconductor .",
    "when the superconductor has @xmath0-wave symmetry ( with a symmetry factor of @xmath221 or @xmath222 ) , the two - dimensional weyl superconductivity phase is realized for an arbitrary magnetization direction in the half - metal .",
    "quasiparticle energy spectra are studied which exhibit interesting variations with the direction of the magnetization . in particular , we have predicted the transition between type - i and type - ii weyl nodes by changing the magnetization orientation .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the phase with the magnetization orientation is unveiled through the lifshitz transitions in the zero - energy quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the phases are shown to be qualitatively different from several well - known types of pairings .",
    "we characterize the topology of phases by the pfaffian @xmath154 invariant and the zak phase .",

    "l.h . would also like to acknowledge the support from the china scholarship council .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed at the center of advanced computing and data systems at the university of houston .",
    "in this section , we perform an analysis on the weyl nodes that are supported in the present system defined by fig . 1 and eq.(3 ) of the main text . in particular ,",
    "as fig.3 has shown the transition from type - i weyl node to type - ii weyl node , it is interesting to investigate the possibility of realizing type - ii weyl nodes in other cases . from the analysis presented below",
    ", the type - ii weyl nodes found in fig.3 for @xmath31 are the only cases where type - ii weyl nodes can be realized in the proposed system .",
    "we also point out the possibility of realizing semi - weyl nodes .    the low - energy effective model for a single weyl node can be written generally in terms of the relative momenta @xmath223 as @xcite @xmath224 where @xmath225 is a label for the specific weyl node under consideration",
    ", @xmath226 is the second - order unit matrix .",

    "otherwise , the weyl node is type - i .    for the heterostructure with @xmath1-wave superconductor , the weyl superconductivity phase ( @xmath1wsc ) appears only when the magnetization lies along in - plane directions ( @xmath68 and @xmath231 ) .",
    "from the low - energy effective model of the weyl nodes for @xmath68 @xcite , the weyl nodes can become type - ii only when the strength of the rsoc ( @xmath15 ) is of the same order of magnitude as the hopping amplitude @xmath12 . since this is unrealistic",
    ", the weyl nodes in the @xmath1wsc can only be type - i .    for the @xmath0wsc with @xmath30 ,",
    "the two weyl nodes emerging for in - plane magnetization are qualitatively the same as the weyl nodes for @xmath1wsc .",
    "following the same analysis as above , they can only be type - i for realistic model parameters .",
    "the remaining four weyl nodes exist for all @xmath3 angles .",

    "@xmath240 , on the other hand gives a velocity of the same order as @xmath12 along @xmath239 . as a result ,",
    "the four weyl nodes @xmath241 ( @xmath47 , @xmath233 ) are type - i for realistic model parameters and all @xmath3 values .    for the @xmath0wsc with @xmath31 ,",
    "there are always four weyl nodes located approximately at @xmath242 ( @xmath47 , @xmath233 ) .",
    "to simplify notation , we introduce the following abbreviations : @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 . for a general @xmath3 , the effective low - energy model for the weyl nodes",

    "note that @xmath254 , the effective model for the two weyl nodes @xmath255 becomes @xmath256 @xmath257 @xmath258 and @xmath259 . from the above effective model , the two weyl nodes at @xmath255",
    "can only be type - ii when @xmath15 is of the same order as @xmath12 , which is unrealistic in the present setting .",
    "an interesting critical case for these two nodes is when the coefficient of @xmath260 in eq.(a12 ) becomes zero . when this happens , the linear in @xmath260 term vanishes , we have to add the term quadratic in @xmath260 .",
    "the nodes thus become linear in @xmath239 but quadratic in @xmath260 , and is thus semi - weyl @xcite . in a hm with large magnetic anisotropy energy , this critical point corresponding to a general @xmath3 angle should be very difficult to attain . if the magnetic anisotropy energy is small so that we can tune @xmath3 through the full @xmath194 range , it is still possible to turn the two weyl nodes at @xmath255 to be semi - weyl .",
