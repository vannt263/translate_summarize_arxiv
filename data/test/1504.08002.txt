    "massive stars are rare in the universe , due both to the low  mass favored imf @xcite and their short life times .",
    "however , their high luminosities and mass  loss rates make them important to the ecology of the universe .",
    "underpinning this understanding is the observational determination of intrinsic stellar parameters for the most massive stars .",
    "however , this is not a simple proposition ; except in rare cases where the distance is known reliably , it requires a detached , non - interacting binary system .",
    "we are aided by the fact that the binary fraction of o stars is nearly unity at birth , though this degrades some as the stars evolve ( e.g. mergers and dynamical interactions : @xcite ) .",
    "still , there are only @xmath3 50 o - star binaries in the milky way and magellanic clouds which meet these criteria and for which individual stellar characteristics have been established @xcite .",
    "this number may increase in the future owing to advances in interferometry , enabling one to determine stellar masses in systems such as hd 150136 ( o3 - 3.5 v((f*))+o5.5 - 6 v((f))+o6.5 - 7 v((f ) ) , @xcite , @xcite ) . right now",
    ", the small number of systems spanning the o spectral type makes calibrating models difficult , but an excellent effort to determine stellar parameters as a function of spectral type was made by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the problem of determining fundamental parameters becomes significantly worse for evolved o stars .",
    "it is extremely important to understand what effect leaving the main sequence has on the fundamental parameters of the star .",
    "however , there are currently only three such systems for which well - constrained masses have been derived , through the use of long baseline interferometry : @xmath4 ori a ( o9.2 ibvar nwk+o9.5 ii - iii(n ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , hd 193322 ( o9.5vnn+o8.5iii+b2.5v , @xcite ) and my ser ( o7.5 iii + o9.5 iii+(o9.5-b0)iii  i , @xcite ) . while increasing the total number of massive star systems with well known parameters is worthwhile , it is difficult as the number of candidate o stars is quite small .",
    "a much more realistic goal is finding a non - interacting example system with minimal mass loss which can be used as a template for understanding the evolution of o stars .",
    "mintaka ( @xmath0 ori ) , the westernmost belt star of orion , by virtue of its proximity ( @xmath5 pc , @xcite ) and brightness ( @xmath6 , @xcite ) , as well as encompassing the detached binary system aa , is an excellent choice .",
    "the @xmath0 ori system has been known to contain multiple components for well over 100 years @xcite .",

    "they worked under the assumption that since the tertiary component contributed @xmath3 25% of the total light ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , significantly more than the secondary , its presence might be able to explain the apparent discrepancy .",
    "they found that motion of the primary in combination with a wide tertiary component with spectral lines broader than that of the primary gave the false impression of orbital motion of the secondary .",

    "we initiated a professional - amateur campaign in order to obtain a large number of high - quality optical spectra simultaneous with our _ most _ and _ chandra _ campaigns .",
    "this resulted in more than 300 moderate resolution ( @xmath11 ) spectra obtained over the 3 week period .",
    "the spectra were reduced by standard techniques utilizing bias , dark , and flat field images .",
    "wavelength calibration was accomplished through comparison with emission - lamp spectra taken before and/or after the object spectra .",
    "our main goal was originally to monitor the h@xmath12 line for wind variability and correlate any such emission with the x - ray spectra ( paper i , paper ii ) while simultaneously obtaining a measure of the orbital motion from the 6678 transition .",
    "however , no significant h@xmath12 variability was seen , except for the radial velocity changes related to the orbital motion of aa1 .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath12 could be diluted by wind emission , making rv measurements questionable . due to both the telluric absorption lines around h@xmath12 and the potential for wind emission , we focused on the he i 6678 transition for our radial velocity measurements .",
    "details of the telescopes and spectrographs used are given in table [ table : speclog ] .",
    "a typical s / n for any observation is @xmath3 100150 .",
    "the spectroscopic treatment of @xmath0 ori a from m10 and h02 are not in agreement .",
    "the m10 analysis assumed a tertiary contribution that was subtracted off , and left a single - lined binary , while the h02 analysis found evidence of the tertiary after iterating to remove first the primary and then the secondary spectrum from the combined one .",
    "the resulting masses are highly discrepant , with m10 assuming a standard mass based on spectral type of @xmath13 , while h02 found @xmath14 .",
    "treatment of the tertiary may lead to severe errors in the inferred stellar parameters .",
    "paper iv presents a quantitative photospheric and wind model for each of the three stars in the @xmath0 ori a system .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite show that the tertiary orbits the binary aa very slowly with a period of several hundred years , although the uncertainties in the tertiary s orbit are very large .",
    "as the period is so long , we expect no measurable kinematic motion in the tertiary component during one month of observations .",
    "therefore , if we take the model of the tertiary spectrum from the models of paper iv , then we can subtract its contribution a priori from the spectra in order to best constrain the binary properties of aa1,2 .",
    "this is similar to what was done by m10 .",
    "if the tertiary is not taken into account , then our results are in agreement with h02 .",
    "however , the optical spectrum consists of @xmath3 25 % contribution from the tertiary ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , so even with our s / n @xmath3 100150 , this contribution should always be seen in our spectra .",
    "we convolved the calculated spectrum of the tertiary to the resolution of our data , and can immediately see that it is the likely source of excess absorption . in figure",
    "[ tert_oplot ] , we show two example profiles of the he i 6678 line ( with large red and blue shifts from the primary s orbital motion ) along with the weighted contribution of the tertiary s spectrum calculated by paper iv . for the redshifted spectrum , we see that the red edge of the profile has an excess of absorption that matches the theoretical spectrum of the tertiary quite well . on the blue edge of the profiles , blending with he",
    "ii 6683 becomes more problematic .",
    "while the tertiary seems to reproduce some of the absorption , most of blue excess comes from the primary star s he ii line .",
    "after we subtracted the weighted contribution from the tertiary star , we cross correlated our observations against the model of the primary calculated by paper iv . from these velocities we calculated a single - lined orbit with the period derived by m10 , as the length of our data sets was insufficient for determining a more precise period .",
    "most velocities had uncertainties on the order of @xmath15 km s@xmath16 from this determination .",
    "data for all the velocities obtained are given in table 4 .",
    "we examined the residuals after removing the primary star s spectrum ( both through shift - and - add and from model subtraction using the spectrum calculated by paper iv ) .",
    "we found no residuals due to the secondary in the data at this point .",
    "this is consistent with the observational results of m10 as well as the results of the modeling of paper iv . in particular",
    ", the modeling results predict that only @xmath17 of the light in this wavelength region comes from the secondary , so the noise associated with the weak features would dominate , as the individual spectra have a signal - to - noise on the order 100150 on average . in order to reliably see the secondary with a s /",
    "n of 50 , we suspect that the combined spectrum of the three component stars needs to have a s / n @xmath18 1000 .",
    "a complete solution for a binary system requires a substantial amount of information . in general",
    ", it requires an eclipsing light curve and two radial velocity curves . despite being studied numerous times",
    ", no one has been able to reliably determine all three of these quantities for @xmath0 ori aa .",
    "this is primarily due to the faintness of the secondary with respect to both the primary and the tertiary . despite the lack of a secondary rv curve , data have two significant advantages over the previous works of h02 and m10 : high precision photometry along with simultaneous spectroscopy .",
    "since there is known apsidal motion in this system ( see section 5 ) having all photometry and spectra taken all within a month timespan mitigates this issue .      for simulation and fitting of the @xmath0 ori system we used the alpha release of phoebe 2.0 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , an engine capable of simulating stars , binaries , and concurrent observational data .",
    "unlike the original phoebe , this is not built directly on the work @xcite and has been rewritten to take into account many second - order effects .",
    "this is especially relevant when dealing with spaced - based data .    before this system was fit ,",
    "some initial processing was required . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : full - lc ] , the light curve of @xmath0 ori is composed of an eclipsing light curve with second order variations superimposed .",
    "these underlying variations can not be easily or completely removed ( see section 6 ) so we must lessen their effects in order to get a more accurate representation of the binary variability .",
    "this can be done by first phasing on the binary period , which requires a precise ephemeris for the system .",
    "since our data span only 3 weeks ( about 3.5 orbits ) , the period determined by m10 is much more precise than what we are able to obtain , so we adopt their value @xmath19 d. for @xmath20 and @xmath21 we adopted our own derived values . for @xmath21 we determined a value from fits to the radial velocity curve of @xmath22 hjd .",
    "for @xmath20 we are actually able to obtain a value from o - c calculations of @xmath23 hjd .",
    "we should note that these numbers offer no specific improvement in the associated error over those derived in m10 , and in the case of @xmath20 the error is slightly worse .",
    "however , unlike m10 our method for determining @xmath20 is independent of the binary fit .",
    "this is important as second order stellar effects ( unknown in previous works ) make determinations from the binary fit less reliable .",
    "in addition , apsidal motion is significant in this system , and we did not want it to affect our results .    using the revised ephemeris ,",
    "the data were phased and then binned to provide a mild smoothing , which yields a template for the binary variations . in this template ,",
    "the error is much smaller than the size of the points .",
    "however , incomplete removal of the secondary variations leads to scatter at the milli - mag level ( see fig . [ phlc ] ) .",
    "ori phased on the orbital period .",
    "it is then binned to 0.0125 in phase to smooth out remaining secondary variations .",
    "the bottom x - axis is phased to time of minimum light and the top is phased to periastron . ]    in addition , modeling of stars and binary systems requires the presence of realistic atmosphere models .",
    "unfortunately , the kurucz atmosphere tables are the only ones which have been incorporated into phoebe 2.0 at this stage and they are insufficient for o stars .",
    "therefore , our best option is to use blackbody atmosphere models . in some cases",
    "this would not be adequate , but for o stars we sample the rayleigh ",
    "jeans tail at optical wavelengths , making the differences from a blackbody minimal . in our specific case",
    ", a comparison with non - lte models calculated for the components of the system indicates a deviation of @xmath24% in the integrated flux across the _ most _ bandpass ( paper iv ) .",
    "therefore , this assumption will not significantly affect our solution as all three stars have similar temperatures and deviations from a blackbody .    ) . in the bottom panels",
    "are the o - c residuals for the corresponding light and radial velocity curves .",
    "the intrinsic stellar variations that we are unable to completely remove are the main source of error .",
    "only one model is plotted as the differences are nearly impossible to distinguish at this scale . ]",
    "phoebe 2.0 has several built  in fitting routines , but for the purposes of this project we decided to use the monte carlo markov chain method ( mcmc ) .",
    "the specific implementation used by phoebe 2.0 is emcee @xcite , an affine invariant mcmc ensemble sampler based on @xcite .",
    "while this routine requires a good initial fit to converge to a solution in a reasonable number of iterations , it gives the most comprehensive analysis of both the fit and the parameter correlations .",
    "mcmc also has become a standard in the fitting of photometric time series ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . for a more general overview of this technique ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "however , this fitting method is not particularly useful without a full complement of constraints .",
    "since we have no secondary rv curve , we must put an extra constraint on the mass .",
    "we know the spectral type of the primary star quite well and can make a reasonable assumption that the mass is @xmath25 @xcite , further supported by non - lte modeling of the system by paper iv .",
    "unfortunately , as there are several viable sets of parameters , the fit was unable to converge to a single minimum .",
    "therefore , we divided this mass range further into three separate ranges : low mass primary ( 21 - 24 @xmath7 ; lm ) , medium mass primary ( 24 - 27 @xmath7 ; mm ) , and high mass primary ( 27 - 29 @xmath7 ; hm ) .",
    "these mass ranges were chosen based on previous results , as the system would converge to one of three possible solutions , with one falling in each bin .    for each possible solution we iterated at least 800 times .",
    "while this may seem insufficient to converge to a true solution , we were not starting from a random point in the parameter space .",
    "parameters were adjusted so that the overall shape and amplitude were consistent with the observed light curve and rv curve before beginning mcmc . indeed , after about 200 iterations the log probability function defining our goodness of fit is virtually constant .    a representation of the quality of these fits for the lm model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bin - fit ] with the upper panels showing the phoebe fit to the light curve ( left ) and rv curve ( right ) .",
    "the lower panels show the corresponding residuals . while there are differences between the three models ,",
    "they are impossible to distinguish on this scale and so only the lm model is shown .",
    "the only motivation for this model over the others is that its primary mass agrees best with what is derived from apsidal motion ( see section 5 ) .",
    "one can see a comparison of the light curve residuals of each of these models in fig .",
    "[ fig : res - comp ] .",
    "this figure demonstrates the differences inherent in the residuals of each model .",
    "these differences are small but still significant , especially within the eclipses .",
    "however , it is impossible to determine quantitatively which solution is best as the standard deviation of the residuals for each fit are the same to within @xmath26 .",
    "it should also be noted that phoebe 2.0 is still undergoing rigorous testing , so while our models seem reasonable , we also simulated our solutions with the original phoebe @xcite to ensure that the results were consistent .",
    "table [ table : bin - fit ] shows the complete solutions for each model as well as comparisons to previous solutions by h02 and m10 .",
    "while the spurious detection of the secondary rv biases the h02 results , there is good agreement between our work and that of m10 .",
    "one point to note is the improvement made to the inclination angle . while each of the previous works had fits at substantially different inclinations from 67@xmath27 - 81@xmath27",
    ", our work shows that this inclination is quite firmly centered at 76@xmath28 regardless of the fit .",
    "in addition all of the orbital parameters are well constrained .",
    "it is very difficult to say if the high , low , or medium mass fit is the best .",
    "the probability function is virtually identical for the three fits , and the only noticeable differences are those for the masses and radii of the primary and secondary . in both the rv and light curve solutions",
    "the residuals are due more to the accuracy of the points than in any differences in the model ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bin - fit ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : res - comp ] ) .",
    "therefore , we must allow for a family of solutions until we are able to retrieve a secondary rv curve . with no clear way to select a best fit model",
    ", we adopt the lm fit throughout this paper when we need to apply a model .",
    "in close binaries such as @xmath0 ori aa , the deformations of the stars in the elliptical orbit cause the longitude of periastron ( @xmath29 ) to precess with time , which is referred to as apsidal motion .",
    "the amount of this precession depends on the mass , internal structure of the stars , and the orbital eccentricity . @xcite and @xcite made assumptions for structure constants of massive stars and then used the measurements of apsidal motion to calculate stellar masses .",
    "@xmath0 ori a has been studied extensively for more than a century and shows signs of significant apsidal motion .",
    "the work of @xcite compiled all determinations of the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "this is combined with more recent studies of h02 and m10 along with our own work to retrieve orbital information spanning over 100 years .",
    "we use these derived orbital elements to calculate the apsidal motion , @xmath30 , using a weighted linear least - squares fit to @xmath29 as a function of time .",
    "the results shown in figure [ apsidal ] present a reasonable fit to the measurements and provide a value of @xmath31     ori",
    ". a weighted linear fit to the published values ( @xcite , h02 , m10 ) yields a measurement of @xmath31 ]    with this measurement of the apsidal advance , we can make some assumptions about the internal structure constants of the primary star .",
    "this relies heavily on the age of the system .",
    "the age of @xmath0 ori is likely best constrained by the study of @xcite who find @xmath0 ori aa1 to be the brightest star in a small cluster .",
    "their study involved deep imaging to understand low - mass stars , and their color - magnitude diagrams imply an age of @xmath24 myr . in order to continue with the calculation",
    "we adopt our orbital parameters from  4.1 . combining these and the models of @xcite",
    ", we obtained the results shown in fig .",
    "[ apsmass ] , which give the stellar mass as a function of age for our derived apsidal motion . with an age of 5 myr",
    ", we see that the derived mass of the primary is @xmath33 .",
    "this value agrees with the spectral  type / mass @xcite and our low mass model ( table [ table : bin - fit ] ) .",
    "@xcite estimate the age of the cluster containing @xmath0 ori , to be 5 myr , corresponding to a mass of @xmath33 consistent with our low mass model .",
    "the different lines represent the model determinations with the extremes of the apsidal motion from the errors ( fig .",
    "[ apsidal ] ) . ]",
    "it is clear from fig . [",
    "fig : full - lc ] that the dominant signal in the light curve comes from binarity .",
    "it is also apparent from the non - phase - locked variations that additional signals are present in @xmath0 ori a. the presence of such variation is not completely unexpected as @xcite reported spectral variability in this system .",
    "however , the variation timescales seen in fig.[fig : full - lc ] are much longer than the @xmath3 4h periodicities they report .        before addressing this variation , we first bin our light curve with the _ most _ orbital period ( 0.074 d ) .",
    "this allows us to mitigate the problem of light scattered into the _ most _ optics ( mainly due to the bright earth ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we ignore variability on time scales shorter than a single orbit .",
    "once this is done , we must remove the eclipsing binary signal .",
    "this variability has already been analyzed in the previous section , and hinders our ability to study the additional variations present .",
    "there are two options available for removal of the binary signal .",
    "we could use the binary template derived earlier ( see fig .",
    "[ phlc ] ) or the lm model fit to this template .",
    "the decision of which binary light curve to use is not obvious , so the analysis was done using both subtractions .",
    "the results are largely the same , and we chose the lm model fit subtraction as the amplitude of the significant peaks was higher and there were slightly more significant frequencies .",
    "this choice is supported by the agreement between the subsequent analysis and the full light curve ( see fig .  [",

    "a common method for finding and classifying periodic signals is known as pre - whitening . in this method peaks",
    "are detected in the fourier transform and then a sinusoid with the corresponding period , amplitude , and phase is subtracted from the light curve .",
    "this is repeated , and a combination of sinusoids representing each frequency are fitted and removed until there are no more significant peaks present .",
    "this method only works if the signals are sinusoidal ( or mostly sinusoidal ) and in the case of @xmath0 ori a , this is not obvious .",

    "the parameters associated with each frequency are given in table [ table : ft - peaks ] .",
    "the fit of these frequencies to the residuals , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resids - lc ] ( black line ) , does a reasonable job of fitting the variations .",
    "while @xcite attribute the variability they find to non - radial pulsations , we see no significant variability in the spectrum around 4 hrs ( 6 c / d ) .        one possible explanation of extra periods is the presence of rotational modulation through starspots .",
    "while this is rarely considered in massive stars , the models of @xcite lend some credibility to this idea .",
    "moreover , the work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show evidence for the occurrence of this phenomenon among o stars .",
    "if rotational modulation is the root cause of the variation , then the largest frequencies would occur near the rotation period of the star .",
    "the vast majority of the remaining peaks could be explained as spurious signals due to the variable nature of star spots ( e.g. lifetimes and number ) as explored extensively by @xcite for the o7.5 iii(n)((f ) ) star @xmath36 per . in our case",
    "the period of the largest amplitude signal is 4.61 d. if we assume this this is the rotation period of @xmath0 ori aa1 , then combined with the @xmath37 ( paper iv ) and the assumption of alignment between the orbital and rotation axis , this yields a radius of @xmath38 for the primary aa1 .",
    "this is smaller than the value found in our models ( see tab . [",
    "fig : bin - fit ] ) and closer to that of a luminosity class iii star @xcite as opposed to class ii which @xmath0 ori aa1 is known to be .",
    "however , it is unclear what the uncertainty in radius would be in the models of @xcite and so this peak remains roughly consistent with rotational modulation .",
    "indeed , the phase folded light curves of the two strongest frequencies ( see fig . [ fig : period - lcs ] ) show evidence of non - sinusoidal behavior . this could be a consequence of a highly non - sinusoidal signal such as rotational modulation .        while this hypothesis is plausible , similar variations can also be caused by pulsations . while rotational modulation would result in a forest of peaks that show no clear relationship to each other @xcite",
    ", pulsations should show evidence of coherent spacings .",
    "all the periodicities we observe are several hours to days long , therefore they would fall in the g - mode regime for all three massive stars seen in this system @xcite .",
    "these modes have the unique quality that when they have the same @xmath39 number they are equally spaced in period .",
    "further explanation can be found in any asteroseismology review ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "now , we can check for period spacings by creating an echelle diagram where the period of each variation is phased modulo a given spacing and plotted .",
    "equally spaced periods will lie roughly along a vertical line .",
    "the echelle diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : echelle ] shows that at least half of the frequencies share a common period spacing .",
    "the results of this analysis provide evidence for pulsations , but this evidence is no more convincing than the idea of rotational modulation .",
    "however , there also appear spacings in the frequency domain .",
    "curiously , 10 of the 13 frequencies show a spacing at two or 3 times the orbital frequency ( see tab . [",
    "table : spacings ] ) .",
    "this spacing suggests that there are tidal interactions associated with these signals .",
    "this is not unprecented as the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite also show some evidence of effects caused by tidal forces in massive binaries .",
    "this variability , though , is unlikely to arise from tidally excited oscillations , which occur at integer harmonics of the orbital frequency ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , in contrast to the oscillations we observe .",
    "however , frequency spacing at multiples of the orbital frequency has been seen in several other close binary stars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and indicates that the pulsations are tidally  influenced . \"",
    "similar to the papers cited above we speculate that the frequency spacing at multiples of the orbital frequency may arise from non - linear interactions between stellar oscillation modes and tidally excited oscillations .",
    "moreover , we interpret the frequency spacing as evidence that the observed variability is generated by stellar oscillations rather than by magnetic activity or rotational modulation .",
    "the main caveat to this hypothesis is that our frequency resolution is limited to 0.047 d@xmath16 due to the short span ( 3 weeks ) of the observations .",
    "this means that there are several spacings that could have been deemed significant .",
    "for instance @xmath40 and @xmath41 would both , within error , fit the same spacing because of how close the two peaks are in frequency .",
    "when this happens , we choose the peak that resulted in a spacing closest to a multiple of the orbital frequency . additionally , the two frequencies which do not appear in tab .",
    "[ table : spacings ] , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are actually split by the orbital frequency .",
    "however , since the uncertainty is half the actual spacing , we choose not to include it . despite these issues , this frequency spacing is pervasive , appearing strongly between nearly every significant peak .",
    "while there is still uncertainty in this claim , it can be lifted with the addition of longer time baseline observations .",
    "another problem is that even if these are tidally  influenced \" oscillations , they still do not completely account for all the variation in this system .",
    "it is possible that these discrepancies could be due to amplitude modulation , though the ratio of period versus observation length makes this unlikely .",
    "it is also possible that there is also rotation modulation in this system from one of the components , just at a lower level than the pulsations .",
    "it is worth noting that the nature of the significant periodicities found in the lowest frequency range of the _ most _ data set is uncertain and could be a result of red noise. normally , this noise could be modeled and removed using autoregressive moving average techniques .",
    "however , our data is not stationary which is a requirement for this type of modeling .",
    "attempts at making the data stationary disrupt the relevant signals ; not only in our data , but also in the synthetic data using combinations of purely sinusoidal signals .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to determine unequivocally the root cause of this variation without the addition of longer baseline photometric data ( see section 8) .",
    "the system @xmath44 ori a remains an ideal candidate to define the intrinsic parameters of evolved o stars .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the primary , @xmath0 ori aa1 , appear consistent with models from paper iv as well as the results from modeling of the apsidal motion .",
    "our analysis removes ambiguity in the derived stellar parameters and makes the primary more consistent with stellar models , without having to appeal to non - conservative mass loss or mass transfer that might play a role in the evolution of a close binary like @xmath0 ori aa .    despite these consistencies ,",
    "@xmath0 ori aa has a rather larger eccentricity of @xmath45 , which is unusual for a close o - star binary system with a moderate age of @xmath3 5 myrs .",
    "in such a situation , circularization of the orbit should already have occurred .",
    "we can check this using the procedure outlined in @xcite with one key assumption : knowledge of the stellar structure constant @xmath46 .",
    "this constant , which is dependent on the interior composition and structure of the star , requires extensive effort to calculate precisely , but can be approximated by the fractional core radius to the eighth power .",
    "we have no evolutionary models for @xmath0 ori aa so we have no way to calculate or estimate @xmath46 directly .",
    "we do know from @xcite that @xmath46 tends to increase as a function of mass , so we will take the value of @xmath47 which is that of a 15 @xmath7 luminosity class v star .",
    "we choose this value as this is the largest mass star for which a value of @xmath46 was derived .",
    "this is clearly an underestimate of @xmath46 which is ameliorated slightly by the fact that @xmath0 ori aa is a slightly expanded luminosity class ii star ( implying a smaller fractional core radius ) .",
    "it is also clear based on the inverse dependence of the circularization time with @xmath46 that the value we obtain will be a maximum .",
    "a quick calculation reveals a circularization timescale of @xmath48myr , which is well short of the age estimate that has been derived for this system .",
    "this result shows that our knowledge of this system is incomplete and could indicate that our assumed primary mass is incorrect .",
    "however , this discrepancy could also be caused by incorrect age calculations , strong interactions with the tertiary component , or issues with our knowledge of stellar structure in massive stars . at the same time",
    ", there is currently no evidence which strongly supports any of these hypotheses , so we are confident in the assumptions made .    the most intriguing aspect of this system is the pronounced second order variations in its light curve .",
    "such variations have never been seen before in this system , and the frequency spacings seem suggestive of tidally induced pulsations .",
    "if confirmed , this would be an important discovery as these modes have been seen rarely if ever in massive stars .",
    "this could lead to asteroseismic modeling and increase our understanding of the interiors of both massive stars in binaries , and massive stars as a whole , especially considering the extremely high fraction of these stars in binaries @xcite .",
    "while we have made significant progress towards understanding this system , it is clear that we are not at the level we need to be .",
    "our ultimate goal is for @xmath0 ori to be a test for both evolutionary and structural models of massive stars . for this objective to be realized",
    ", we must determine fundamental parameters to high precision .",
    "for this reason it is imperative that we identify the presence of the secondary component within the spectrum .",
    "in addition , we must improve our frequency resolution within the fourier spectrum .",
    "this will require a long time - series of high - precision photometry . as a result",
    ", we could identify with confidence the source of the variation , which could possibly allow for asteroseismic modeling .",
    "a secondary consequence of this would be an improved binary light curve with significantly reduced scatter from which to model our system .",
    "this would also lead to improved values of fundamental parameters , and place constraints on the apsidal advance of the system .",
    "this analysis to understand @xmath0 ori , in conjunction with papers i , ii , and iv , has highlighted the need to obtain the spectral characteristics and rv curve of @xmath0 ori aa2 .",
    "we will use both the _ hubble space telescope _ and _ gemini - north _ to obtain high - resolution spectra of the binary at opposite quadratures while spatially separating the tertiary and observing its spectrum .",
    "these observations are scheduled for the upcoming observing season , and we also plan to obtain higher signal - to - noise optical spectroscopy from the observatoire de mont mgantic",
    ". these observations will provide excellent constraints on the modeling of the system and reveal any unusual spectroscopic variability seen in the tertiary star .",
    "this will provide more constraints on the photometric variability seen with _",
    "most _ .    a better characterization of this variability as well as the binary parameters requires access to long time baseline photometry , which _ most _ is not able to provide",
    ". the _ brite - constellation _ project , however , is designed to provide 6 months of continuous coverage in both blue and red filters @xcite . _",
    "brite - constellation _ began initial data acquisition of the orion constellation in october of 2013 . since this was the initial data taken , the full 6 months of continuous coverage was not achieved .",
    "however , there are nearly three continuous months of data in both filters .",
    "these data should be released to the collaboration in early 2015 .",
    "in addition , a second run with _",
    "brite - constellation _ began in oct .",
    "2014 that should provide a full 6-month time - series .",
