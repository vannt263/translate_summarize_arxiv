    "percolation is a simple phase transition that can occur in a great many systems that exhibit branched network structure@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that one occupies , at random , either the components of the system ( often sites on a lattice ) or the links between the components ( bonds between sites ) .",
    "as the occupation probability per site ( or bond ) increases , clusters of connected elements form and grow .",
    "when the occupation probability exceeds a critical value @xmath0 , there is a cluster that spans the length of the system ( or wraps , in simulations with convenient periodic boundary conditions ) , from one side to the other . in the context of a lattice",
    ", one could envision the percolating cluster as being a continuous object that touches both sides of the system .",
    "percolation theory has applications in a great many contexts , ranging from materials science topics such as gelation or transport in porous media , to societally relevant contexts such as disease propagation and forest fires .",
    "the percolation threshold is only known exactly for special classes of lattices , all in 2d@xcite . for most systems one must use monte carlo simulations to compute @xmath0@xcite .",
    "one determines @xmath0 in simulations by occupying sites ( or bonds ) one - at - a - time in a random order , stopping when the occupation of one more site ( or bond ) results in the formation of a wrapping cluster .",
    "different random orders give percolation at different site occupation fractions , and after a large number of lattices have been simulated one obtains a sigmoidal plot of percolation probability ( _ i.e .",
    "_ probability of a wrapping cluster forming ) _ vs. _",
    "site occupation probability ( figure [ fig : rlschematic ] ) .",
    "the percolation threshold is the point on the plot at which the wrapping probability rises rapidly from zero to one .        despite the paucity of exact results ,",
    "analytical formulas have been proposed to provide approximate predictions ( of varying accuracy ) for @xmath0 on different lattices , _ e.g.  _ @xcite .",
    "one physically intuitive approximation for the percolation threshold is a power - law relation , noted by galam and mauger , between coordination number @xmath1 and percolation threshold @xmath0@xcite .",
    "power - law behavior is ubiquitous in critical phenomena , and the power - law relation is known to give reasonably accurate predictions of @xmath0 for many lattices with @xmath2 in 2 , 3 , and sometimes higher dimensions .",
    "recently , it has also been shown to give fairly accurate predictions of @xmath0 for @xmath1 as low as 3 in 3d@xcite .",
    "the power - law relation has been shown to be problematic in regards to its predictive power and accuracy@xcite .",
    "for instance , lattices are grouped by galam and mauger into 3 different universality classes , but the theory provides no criterion for determining which class a lattice should belong to . moreover , there are many situations in which two lattices have the same coordination number and dimensionality , but due to differences in higher - order aspects of structure their percolation thresholds differ , _ e.g.  _ the triangular and octagonal lattices in 2d ( which have the same site percolation threshold but different bond percolation thresholds ) @xcite , or the body - centered cubic and stacked triangular lattices in 3d@xcite .",
    "the power - law scaling formula also lacks a number of other properties that would be desirable in any accurate and widely - applicable predictor of percolation thresholds@xcite . despite these problems ,",
    "the power - law formula of galam and mauger remains of some interest because it shows a common ( if not universal ) trend of approximately power - law behavior in a phase transition .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this power - law scaling of @xmath0 continues to hold for @xmath3 .",
    "while it is impossible to construct an interesting lattice in which _ all _ of the sites have @xmath3 ( it would just be a linear chain ) , one can still construct very interesting lattices in which _ some _ of the sites have @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e.  _ some dangling atoms , analogous to the role of singly - bonded hydrogen in a macromolecule , but from a percolation standpoint such lattices are uninteresting .",
    "the occupation of a @xmath5 site can not connect two clusters to form a single cluster that wraps around the system , and thus it can be eliminated from the model without affecting any conclusions concerning connectivity and transport .",
    "] , and others have @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath4 sites can make the lattice analogous to some oxides , with 2-coordinated sites ( analogous to oxygen atoms ) joining together exactly 2 other sites .",
    "unfortunately , the conjectured power - law relation can not remain valid when the average coordination number gets sufficiently close to 2 .",
    "the power - law formula is : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 for site percolation on 2d kagom lattices and regular lattices in 3 or more dimensions , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 for simple 2d lattices ( _ e.g .  _",
    "square , honeycomb , and triangular ) . for @xmath4 and @xmath12",
    "it predicts @xmath13 , when it should obviously be @xmath14 for @xmath4 ( which corresponds to a 1d chain ) .",
    "given that this relationship can not remain valid for @xmath1 arbitrarily close to 2 , but that it does work ( to within @xmath15 ) for @xmath16@xcite , it is reasonable to explore other low-@xmath1 cases to determine the accuracy of the power - law scaling relation .",
    "the introduction of 2-coordinated sites along the bonds of a lattice is equivalent to introducing a mixed site - bond problem , in which sites are occupied with probability @xmath17 and bonds are occupied with probability @xmath18@xcite . if we place a single oxygen atom ( 2-coordinated site ) along each bond , and treat the 2-coordinated sites the same as the other sites ( _ i.e .  _",
    "occupy them with the same probability as other sites ) , we have a site - bond problem with @xmath19 .",
    "physically , one could visualize this problem as corresponding to an oxide , in which the two - coordinated sites correspond to oxygen atoms and the higher - coordinated sites correspond to atoms of higher valence .",
    "alternately , if one wished to visualize these problems in terms of communications networks or similar phenomena , the 2-coordinated sites would correspond to possible points of failure in connections between network nodes . if we introduce additional 2-coordinated sites ( _ i.e .",
    "_ more than one per bond ) and continue to treat them on an even footing with the other sites we have a problem with @xmath20 .",
    "this equivalence between a problem with low coordination number and a site - bond percolation problem enables us to use existing results for site - bond percolation to probe site percolation on lattices with @xmath3 .",
    "however , setting up a lattice with average coordination number less than 3 and finding its percolation threshold is not sufficient for understanding the behavior of @xmath0 at low @xmath1 .",
    "we also need a proper quantitative measure of average coordination number on that lattice .",
    "there are a number of plausible approaches that one could take .",
    "intuitively , one could compute the average number of atoms per site , an approach based on the structure of the lattice .",
    "alternately , one could compute the average number of available bonds between high - coordinated sites , an approach based on the connectivity of the lattice at a particular occupation fraction , and one that we will show to be useful in this work .    to illustrate the difference between these measures ,",
    "consider the lattice in figure [ fig : zeff ] .",
    "it is a square oxide structure , with a 3-atom basis outlined in red .",
    "the average coordination number per site is easy to compute .",
    "there are 2 atoms with 2 neighbors apiece , and there is 1 atom with 4 neighbors .",
    "the average coordination number is thus @xmath21 .",
    "however , forming a cluster that wraps around the system requires linking 4-coordinated sites to one another . if we occupy sites with probability @xmath22 , and treat the 4-coordinated sites on the same basis as 2-coordinated sites ( _ i.e .",
    "_ occupy each type of site with the same probability ) then the average number of sites occupied between the 4-coordinated sites is @xmath23 , and thus each 4-coordinated site has connections to ( on average ) @xmath23 other sites ( which may or may not be occupied ) . more generally , if we start with a lattice on which each site has coordination number @xmath24 , introduce ( possibly multiple ) 2-coordinated sites along some or all of the bonds , and occupy those sites in such a way that there is a probability @xmath18 of having an unbroken bond between the @xmath25-coordinated sites , the average number of accessible neighbors per @xmath25-coordinated site will be @xmath26 .",
    "we will show here that choosing the later measure ( number of bonds between high - coordinated sites ) leads to a more robust scaling between percolation threshold and coordination number for lattices with mixed coordination numbers .",
    "in what follows we will study lattices with low coordination number in two different ways : first , we will use monte carlo simulations to compute site percolation thresholds on three oxide - type lattices with average coordination number less than 3 : the sio@xmath27 lattice ( a diamond lattice with 2-coordinated oxygen atoms along the bonds ) and two 3-coordinated lattices ( ( 10,3)-a and ( 10,3)-b@xcite ) with 2-coordinated oxygen atoms introduced along their bonds . as a check on the scaling behavior of @xmath0 at low coordination number we will also study a  cubic oxide \" with average coordination number 3 .",
    "we will show that the percolation thresholds of these lattices are consistent ( to better than @xmath28 , and in 2 cases to better than @xmath29 ) with the power law conjectured by galam and mauger if average coordination number is defined in terms of the average number of bonds between high - coordinated sites rather than the average number of neighbors per site .",
    "second , using existing data on site - bond percolation problems@xcite , we will map mixed site - bond problems onto pure site percolation problems with low coordination numbers and show that power - law scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath1 again holds if the average coordination number is measured by the average number of bonds per high - coordinated site . based on these results , we conjecture that power - law scaling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 holds if one defines @xmath1 in terms of available links between higher - coordinated sites , leading to an implicit formula for @xmath0 that incorporates aspects of lattice structure beyond dimensionality and average coordination number .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the four lattices that we are studying here : silicon dioxide , ( 10,3)-a oxide , ( 10,3)-b oxide , and cubic oxide .",
    "we will describe the structure of these lattices in their most symmetric forms , so that the reader can visualize them in plausible physical realizations .",
    "however , as in our previous work@xcite , for computational purposes we deformed the bond orientations so that the lattices could be mapped onto cubic grids , albeit with fewer than six bonds to each site .",
    "percolation thresholds are governed only by the presence of the bonds , not their orientations .",
    "deforming the lattice in a way that preserves the connections between sites does not change its percolation threshold , but leads to greater convenience in enumerating sites . the process of this deformation for ( 10,3)-a and ( 10,3)-b can be seen in greater detail in our previous work .",
    "the silicon dioxide lattice is based on the diamond lattice , which is a face centered cubic lattice whose primitive cell consists of two lattice points .",
    "each site is connected to four others in a tetrahedral pattern@xcite .",
    "the silicon dioxide lattice is a diamond lattice in which each bond between tetrahedrally coordinated sites has been replaced by a 2-coordinated site .",
    "the average coordination number per site on this lattice is @xmath30 .      the ( 10,3)-a lattice is part of a larger family of 3-coordinated lattices .",
    "the lattices in this family go by a number of names , but perhaps the most exhaustive exploration of this family of lattices was by wells , who coined the name ( 10,3)@xcite . the 3 reflects the 3-fold coordination of the sites .",
    "the number 10 reflects the fact that if one were to make a circuit on the lattice , traveling site - by - site and visiting no site more than once before the return to the starting point , the shortest path would be a 10-gon .",
    "the -a reflects the fact that there are 7 lattices in this family , named alphabetically : ( 10,3)-a , ( 10,3)-b , _ etc . _  in its most symmetric realization , the ( 10,3)-a lattice is a bcc lattice with a 4-atom basis , each site having three neighbors .",
    "this lattice is of interest for a number of reasons , including the fact that there are real materials with this structure ( _ e.g",
    ".  _ block copolymers@xcite , molecular magnets@xcite , and even butterfly wings@xcite ) .",
    "additionally , it has unusually high symmetry , possessing a property known as  strong isotropy\"@xcite , shared with only one other 3d lattice ( diamond ) .",
    "the structure of ( 10,3)-a is illustrated in our previous paper on this subject@xcite .    the oxide form that we will study for this lattice is one in which a 2-coordinated site is inserted between each 3-coordinated site . if we denote the 2-coordinated sites as o ( for oxygen ) and the 3-coordinated sites as x , the stoichiometric formula of this structure is x@xmath27o@xmath31 , but it is important to note that this is _ not _ the typical structure of a group iii oxide ( _ e.g .  _",
    "the most common form of aluminum oxide has a coordination number higher than 3@xcite ) . for our purposes here , ( 10,3)-a oxide is of interest for being a convenient lattice with a low coordination number",
    ". for each pair of 3-coordinated sites there are 3 2-coordinated sites , giving an average coordination number of @xmath32 .",
    "we illustrate it figure [ fig:103aox ] , with bond orientations deformed to fit the lattice onto a cubic grid for convenience in enumerating sites .          the ( 10,3)-b lattice is similar to ( 10,3)-a , in that the shortest circuit that returns to a site is a 10-gon , and that the primitive cell has four atoms .",
    "the effective coordination number of the oxide is again 2.4 .",
    "however , the lattice contains an extra structural degree of freedom .",
    "even if all bond angles are 120 degrees , and all bonds are equal length ( _ i.e .  _ a highly symmetric realization of the lattice ) , we can continuously deform the lattice in a manner that uniformly changes the spacing between planes without altering any bond lengths or angles . in the maximally symmetric case ,",
    "the lattice is body - centered tetragonal with a four - atom basis . if , however , we compress the lattice to decrease the spacing between planes , it begins to look like a 3d generalization of a honeycomb lattice , being a stacking of interwoven honeycomb planes . for this reason , the (",
    "10,3)-b lattice has been referred to as the  hyper honeycomb \" lattice , and has attracted some interest in the study of spin systems@xcite .",
    "we will consider an oxide form which , again , has a 2-coordinated site along each bond .",
    "we illustrate it figure [ fig:103box ] , with bond orientations deformed to fit the lattice onto a cubic grid for convenience in enumerating sites .",
    "cubic oxide is a simple cubic lattice ( 6-coordinated sites ) with 2-coordinated oxygen sites along the bonds between the 6-coordinated sites .",
    "there are 6 oxygen sites bonded to each 6-coordinated site .",
    "the oxygen sites are shared between 2 neighbors , so the stoichiometric formula is xo@xmath31 and the average coordination number is @xmath33 .",
    "while we have studied the case of @xmath16 in our previous work on 3-coordinated lattices , this case was included to see if there are significant differences between a homogeneous lattice ( all sites the same coordination number ) and an oxide with a different underlying structure but the same average coordination number .",
    "we determined @xmath0 with the algorithm of newman and ziff@xcite .",
    "we described our implementation in previous work@xcite . in brief",
    ", the newman - ziff algorithm occupies sites or bonds on a lattice in a random order .",
    "when a new site ( or bond ) is occupied , the program checks to see if it borders an existing cluster of sites ( or bonds ) .",
    "if so , it joins that cluster . if the new site ( or bond ) bridges two existing clusters , the clusters are merged . finally ,",
    "if the occupation of a new site ( or bond ) joins two parts of an existing cluster and causes them to wrap completely around , then percolation has occurred , and the program moves on to randomly occupy sites or bonds on a new , fresh lattice . by repeating this process @xmath34 times , one can get the fraction @xmath35 of lattices of linear dimension @xmath36 ( _ i.e .",

    "we multiply the probability of that occupation number occurring ( from the binomial distribution ) by the wrapping probability for that occupation number .",
    "the plot of @xmath41 has a steep rise at the percolation threshold @xmath0 , and one could obtain a reasonable estimate of @xmath0 simply by looking for the point on the graph with the steepest slope .",
    "however , one can obtain a higher precision estimate by comparing plots of @xmath41 for several different values of the linear dimension @xmath36 .",
    "the percolation threshold is the point at which the wrapping probability crosses over from 0 to 1 , and the width of this cross - over region gets smaller as @xmath36 increases .",

    "the measures we considered here for average coordination number are not the only possible approaches .",
    "galam and mauger proposed that one could define an effective coordination number as the value of @xmath1 that minimizes the sum of the errors in the site and bond percolation thresholds ( with errors defined as the difference between the actual percolation threshold and the predictions of power - law scaling ) .",
    "however , this is an after - the - fact definition of effective coordination number , requiring knowledge of the true percolation threshold .",
    "one can not derive this effective coordination number from a direct examination of lattice geometry , but only from already knowing the percolation threshold .",
    "our approach , in which we define @xmath76 as the effective coordination number at the percolation threshold , can be used to obtain a prediction of @xmath0 without _ a priori _ knowledge of the percolation threshold .",
    "if one uses power - law scaling , one gets an implicit formula for an oxide s site percolation threshold @xmath0 : @xmath77 this equation can be solved for @xmath0 , as long as one knows @xmath25 , @xmath73 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "we can generalize this procedure . consider a more complicated lattice , such as the octagonal lattice ( figure [ fig : octagonal ] ) with site percolation threshold @xmath78 ( because it is fully triangulated ) @xcite .",
    "we consider the octagonal lattice because ( 1 ) its combination of site and bond@xcite percolation thresholds make it a plausible candidate for being in the same universality class as the kagom  lattice@xcite and ( 2 ) its structure of mixed coordination numbers is more complex than the oxides considered above , but is nonetheless simple to study .",
    "let us assume that formation of a percolating cluster is dominated by the 8-coordinated sites , and that the 4-coordinated sites primarily serve to facilitate links between 8-coordinated sites .",
    "each 8-coordinated site has direct bonds to 4 other 8-coordinated sites , as well as 4 4-coordinated sites .",
    "occupation of these other 4-coordinated sites is not the only way to reach other 8-coordinated sites , but we can begin by trying to  average out \" the 4-coordinated sites , modeling this in a manner analogous a site - problem .    in our approximation , where we replace 4-coordinated sites with bonds , at the percolation",
    "threshold @xmath79 of the 4-coordinated neighbors will be occupied and permit access to 8-coordinated neighbors .",
    "additionally , there are direct bonds to 4 other 8-coordinated sites .",
    "the average coordination number is thus @xmath80 .",
    "if we assume the power - law scaling relation to hold , we get : @xmath81 this is an implicit equation for @xmath0 .",
    "more importantly , it was derived by taking into account features of the lattice beyond nearest neighbors , addressing one of the common criticisms of the galam - mauger power law . if we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : octagonal ] ) numerically we get that the site percolation threshold is @xmath82 .",
    "this is reasonably close to the exact site percolation threshold of @xmath83 , but still not resounding agreement .",
    "however , when we use this prediction of the site percolation threshold to compute an effective coordination number ( @xmath84 ) and then use that in galam and mauger s formula for the bond percolation threshold , we get the prediction @xmath85 , which agrees with the bond percolation threshold determined from monte carlo simulations ( @xmath86 ) to @xmath87 .",
    "while our inclusion of the octagonal lattice in the same universality class as kagom  is just conjecture , the site bond results for octagonal in figure [ fig:3dzeff ] follow the same trend as kagome and the 3d lattices , suggesting that its inclusion in this conjectured universality class is a hypothesis worthy of further study .",
    "of course , our approach to  averaging out \" lower - coordinated sites is _ ad hoc _ and gives no obvious prescription for more general lattices .",
    "we only present it as the beginning of an idea that might be generalized to more complicated lattices : treating the higher - coordinated sites as the key players in the formation of a percolating cluster , and the lower - coordinated sites as providing an average number of bonds between the higher - coordinated sites . by removing the lower - coordinated sites from explicit consideration ,",
    "one is removing the shortest length scales from the analysis , bringing in ideas analogous to renormalization group calculations .",
    "however , renormalization treatments of percolation do not assume compliance with an empirical power law derived from monte carlo simulation results , unlike our use of the galam mauger formula",
    ". nonetheless , power laws are closely related to the idea of scale invariance , raising the question of whether our approach to oxides and the octagonal lattice might have connections to renormalization ideas .",
    "however , given that there are demonstrated examples of lattices for which our approach does _ not _ support a power - law relationship between site percolation threshold and average coordination number , a more rigorous exploration of these ideas would have to provide some criterion for identifying the lattices that can be treated by this approach .",
    "criteria that relate lattice topology to properties of percolating clusters seem especially promising for further insight@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a conjectured power - law relationship between site percolation threshold and average coordination number holds for a number of lattices with average coordination number less than 3 .",
    "these lattices are closely analogous to oxide materials .",
    "the quantitative accuracy of the power - law scaling relationship depends on how the average coordination number is defined and measured , with better agreement when we define average coordination number as the average number of available bonds between higher - coordinated sites .",
    "when we apply that definition of average coordination number to site - bond percolation problems , we find that existing simulation results are roughly consistent with the power - law scaling conjecture for site percolation .",
    "more interestingly , this approach turns the power - law scaling formula into an implicit formula for @xmath0 , one that can ( in some cases ) take into account next - nearest neighbors .",
    "finally , although there are some key cases in which our approach fails to give good agreement between simulation results and the conjectured power - law scaling behavior , the relevant lattices are those that had previously been conjectured to fall into a distinct universality class . while there are still significant problems with the power - law scaling formula and the conjectured universality classes , our results suggest that a re - examination is merited , to see if there are ways to refine these conjectures to take into account additional features of the lattice structure and refine estimates of percolation thresholds .",
