    "statistical mechanics , be it for classical or quantum many - body systems , relies on the reasonable assumption that all microstates of a system in equilibrium are equally likely to be realized . in order to be correctly described by a statistical ensemble , a system must therefore be either coupled to an infinite thermal bath , or ( if isolated ) effectively display some form of ergodicity as per the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis @xcite , thereby allowing it to forget its initial state by ` relaxing ' towards a well - defined equilibrium state independent of the starting conditions .",
    "the existence of these relaxation processes is not usually questioned , but their precise mechanisms occur in a generally unspecified manner . for individual systems , classical mechanics distinguishes integrable and non - integrable cases , the former possibly having stable quasiperiodic orbits protected by the kam theorem @xcite , and therefore showing no true ergodicity . for non - integrable cases , ergodicity is taken for granted as a consequence of chaotic dynamics .    in the quantum case , the question of equilibration has been the subject of many recent works , focusing in particular on the time evolution of a system after a quantum quench , at which a global parameter in the hamiltonian is suddenly changed @xcite - @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to releasing a prepared state and letting it evolve unitarily in time according to the hamiltonian after the quench .",
    "such situations , some of which are experimentally realizable , lead to many interesting theoretical questions . under what circumstances is there a well - defined state at large times ( _ i.e. _ what , if anything , remains of the initial conditions for given quench situations ) ? can a general theory of relaxation based purely on the details of quantum dephasing be formulated ?",
    "are there different classes of systems ( _ e.g. _ integrable versus non - integrable , finite versus infinite , gapped versus gapless ) having different generic behaviour ? what remains of the usefulness of",
    "commonly used quasiparticle bases to understand the dynamics after the quench ?",
    "clearly , much progress remains to be done in order to have a full understanding of all these issues .",
    "it is our purpose here to consider a well - defined situation , which can be handled to a sufficient degree of exactness to provide some partial but reliable insights into some of these questions .",
    "the approach we will consider is based on the use of exact wavefunctions for the heisenberg magnet , and therefore exploits the integrability of this system . on the one hand , this renders some of our results non - generic . on the other hand , we are able to provide hard facts for finite as well as infinite systems , gapped versus gapless , and exclude some possible scenarios . since the theoretical understanding of the nonequilibrium dynamics of strongly - correlated systems is still in its infancy",
    ", such example cases will hopefully provide worthwhile reference points for later developments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first define our nonequilibrium problem , and present the tools we will use to study it .",
    "we then discuss in section 3 the set of eigenstates we use to obtain quantitative results .",
    "section 4 considers the work probability distribution resulting from the quench for various system parameters . in section 5 , we study relaxation dynamics by concentrating on the loschmidt echo , which we compute . after a few words on the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "we offer a discussion of our results and present our conclusions . all technical details for the computations",
    "are relegated to a series of appendices , which can safely be skipped by the reader only interested in the final results and conclusions . on the other hand",
    ", these appendices explain all calculations in sufficient detail to be reproduced by the specialist reader .",
    "we consider an isolated spin chain of @xmath2 sites , each occupied by a local spin-@xmath0 degree of freedom . for definiteness , we put the spins on a ring and impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the thought experiment we perform consists in preparing the quantum state of the system at @xmath3 as @xmath4 this state thus contains a magnetic domain wall between sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and another ( anti- ) domain wall between sites @xmath2 and @xmath7 ( in view of the periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "this state can be prepared in different ways : we can view it as being created by an ising model with an appropriate position - dependent field , or as resulting from a sudden polarizing pulse applied on a section of an initially fully polarized chain . for times",
    "@xmath8 , we let this state evolve unitarily in time under the antiferromagnetic xxz hamiltonian @xmath9.\\ ] ] note that the hamiltonian is rescaled by a factor of @xmath10 as compared to how it usually appears in the literature , in order the have a well - defined ising limit ( @xmath11 ) . for @xmath1",
    "the spectrum of this theory is gapped , while for @xmath12 the system is in the quantum critical regime .",
    "we consider the case when the system is antiferromagnetic ( i.e. @xmath13 ) . in order to simplify the expressions and without loss of generality we put @xmath14 throughout the paper .",
    "the initial domain wall state ( [ domainwallstate ] ) is not an eigenstate of the xxz hamiltonian away from the ising limit @xmath15 . on the other hand , for any fixed value of @xmath16 , the exact eigenstates of this model form a basis in the hilbert space on which we can at least in principle decompose the initial domain - wall state to arbitrary accuracy . given this decomposition , the solution of the schrdinger equation becomes straightforward , and we obtain the exact time - dependent wavefunction after the quench as the linear decomposition @xmath17 eigenstates of @xmath18 at fixed total magnetization , and the complex amplitudes @xmath19 represent the overlaps ( vector of the quench matrix ) between the starting state and the exact eigenfunctions . since we always work with normalized wavefunctions , the coefficients @xmath19 should by definition satisfy the constraint @xmath20 this constraint will constitute an important sum rule , allowing to quantify the accuracy of our results by assessing how faithfully the resulting wavefunction is reproduced .    all the complexity of the problem is therefore hidden in two places .",
    "first , wavefunctions @xmath21 and their energy @xmath22 must be known .",
    "this is standardly handled by the bethe ansatz ( see references @xcite - @xcite and references therein ; we provide a summary of the necessary details in appendices a and b ) .",
    "second , the overlaps @xmath19 must also be known .",
    "this is a problem of much greater complexity , which in the present situation finds its solution in the framework of the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "the derivation of these overlaps is given in appendices c and d. note that similar overlaps ( quench matrix entries ) were also recently calculated using the algebraic bethe ansatz for the case of the interaction - quenched richardson model @xcite . here",
    ", we also obtain these overlaps using integrability , but using a different method based on the explicit structure of the solutions to the bethe equations .    despite being in possession of these two fundamental building blocks ,",
    "one major difficulty remains .",
    "since the hilbert space is exponentially large in system size @xmath2 , the summation in ( [ timeevolphi ] ) is difficult to handle , and must in practice be truncated in order to reach sizes sufficiently large to allow the discrimination between finite- and infinite - size behaviour",
    ". we will show in the next section that this truncation is possible in the situation we consider .",
    "in particular , this puts us in position to study the long - time average of observables according to any prescription desired , a common one being @xmath23 and to make reliable observations on the relaxation / thermalization of the prepared state .",
    "the time evolution of this domain wall state has been studied in similar settings . for gapless spin chains this type of quench",
    "is studied in @xcite .",
    "an exact analysis has been carried out for the xx - chain in @xcite .",
    "the short time regime for the xxz chain is studied using tdmrg in @xcite , and an exact diagonalization was performed for the gapped xxz chain with open boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we here offer a complement to these studies , consisting in results from integrability .",
    "the space of eigenstates of the xxz chain is spanned by bethe wavefunctions , each described by a set of rapidity parameters @xmath24 obtained as solution to the bethe equations .",
    "bethe wavefunctions are generically quite complicated objects , and can contain both unbound and bound magnons .",
    "we refer the reader to the standard literature @xcite as well as to our appendices for the basic detail . in summary ,",
    "solutions of the bethe ansatz equations can be classified using strings ( see appendix [ a : bae ] for a discussion ) .",
    "an @xmath25string in a set of @xmath26 complex rapidities sharing the same real part and invariant under complex conjugation .",
    "these strings can be interpreted as bound states of ` mass ' @xmath26 . in the ising - limit",
    "it can be shown that an @xmath26-string corresponds to @xmath26 adjacent down spins . from a perturbative analysis , we expect at large anisotropy @xmath16 a well - defined hierarchy of states in terms of the importance of their overlap with the domain wall state . this hierarchy is presented in table [ tab : hierarchy ] .",
    "the most important states are those consisting of a single @xmath27string , which occupy a dispersionless line in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "they are followed by successively more complicated partitionings of the @xmath5 rapidities into more and more individual bound or unbound states , each partitioning representing a whole continuum of excitations .",
    "the number of particles in the state is defined here to be the number of elements in the partitioning . from a perturbative analysis",
    "it can be easily shown that for sufficiently large @xmath5 the system is insensitive to small changes of @xmath5 ( _ i.e. _ , of how distant the domain and anti - domain walls are from each other ) .",
    "this allows us to perform the calculation with an @xmath5 slightly below @xmath28 without loss of generality .",
    "the reason for this choice is that for these values the string hypothesis is better satisfied for the majority of string states .",
    ".the hierarchy of states , in order of importance of contributions to the normalization sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) .",
    "each partitioning of @xmath5 rapidities into strings leads to an independent excitation class , only the few shown here being of relevance to the current setup .",

    "in this work we studied the relaxation dynamics of the gapped xxz chain after a quench from an initial domain wall state . the techniques that were used are based on the algebraic bethe ansatz for a finite chain .",
    "some of the results were extended to the thermodynamic limit . the key ingredient for studying this quench was deriving a numerically efficient expression for the overlap between the initial state and eigenstates of the xxz hamiltonian .",
    "overlaps for different ising states as initial state could be computed following the same logic , however in the general case of a finite density of domain walls this will become an intractable combinatorial problem .",
    "since the energies of the relevant part of the spectrum are intensive a good comparison with the thermodynamic limit is possible .",
    "one important result is that the bandwidth of the @xmath27strings is nonzero for finite systems allowing the long time average of the loschmidt echo going to zero , something that does not happen in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence we conclude that the limits @xmath29 and @xmath30 do not commute , which was also pointed out in @xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit we derived a lower bound for the infinite time average of the loschmidt echo and argue that this bound is the exact value .",
    "this led us to the most important conclusion of this paper , namely that the system for this quench will not thermalize .",
    "the reason why the system does not thermalize can be explained from its spectrum , and does not directly rely on the fact that the system is integrable .",
    "imagine for instance a gapped system with lowest ( or highest ) band having zero bandwidth in the thermodynamic limit , such as a system with macroscopically - degenerate ground states .",
    "consider a quench such that @xmath31 lies right between the lowest ( or highest ) energy band and the next one .",
    "a lower bound for the overlap @xmath32 of the lowest band can then be obtained by simple reasoning .",
    "let @xmath33 be the energy of the lowest energy band of zero bandwidth .",
    "we denote the band gap by @xmath34 .",
    "the expectation value of the initial hamiltonian is @xmath35 .",
    "we then choose @xmath36 .",
    "in this case we can obtain a lower bound for the total overlap of the @xmath33 states .",
    "@xmath37 from which follows the lower bound @xmath38 in other words , such a quench must occupy the lowest ( resp .",
    "highest ) dispersionless band with @xmath39 amplitude .",
    "since these states are dispersionless and separated from other states by a band gap , they can not dephase , and therefore can not effectively relax .",
    "the large - time asymptotic state will therefore always maintain memory of the ground state occupation amplitude of this band , which is a quench - dependent quantity .",
    "note that such situations trivially can not show eigenstate thermalization according to the arguments of @xcite , in which such circumstances were argued to be non - generic and therefore not treated .",
    "the condition used for deriving this lower bound is quite strong . in figure",
    "[ fig : spectrum_overlaps ] one can see that for @xmath40 that @xmath31 does not lie in the gap anymore , but the overlaps of the @xmath27string are still substantially big .",
    "one can also question whether the condition of an isolated peak is essential . from the work probability distribution",
    "it is clear that the contributions of states made up of different strings can be distinguished .",
    "simply looking at energy levels is therefore insufficient to assess the presence or absence of relaxation , and one must also take into account the values of the wavefunction overlaps . if we consider for example @xmath26 strings with a diverging length in the thermodynamic limit , they all will become coherent .",
    "although they are embedded in a continuum , we can reasonably expect a non - zero height peak of zero width in @xmath41 , which again will prevent thermalization .    in the case of evolution under a gapless hamiltonian",
    ", our method loses its efficiency , since all overlaps scale to zero and the number of states to take into account grows accordingly , preventing an efficient truncation of the sum in [ timeevolphi ] .",
    "the absence of a gap thus opens the door to dephasing involving arbitrarily complex excitation continua , in correspondence with anderson s orthogonality catastrophe principle .",
    "therefore it is expected that @xmath42 in this case , and the possibility of thermalization remains , although it can not be quantified here .",
    "the presence of a gap is thus determinantal to the long - time asymptotics of dynamics after the quench release of the domain wall state , but is not very sensitive to system size for large enough systems .",
    "to summarize we considered a quench starting from a domain wall state under the time evolution of the gapped xxz chain .",
    "we observed that the long time behavior can not be described by a statistical ensemble .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the spectrum is gapped , and does not directly rely on the fact that the system is integrable .",
    "furthermore we were able to assess finite size effects by considering both results for the finite and infinite systems .",
    "general conclusions for the long time behavior of the xxz model after quench can not however be drawn from the results presented here .",
    "for instance , the two quasi - degenerate ground states of the xxz chain we are dealing with are separated from all other states by the gap , so one might expect a similar effect if one would perform a quench starting from the nel state . however , the low energies are extensive in contrast with the high energy excitations which are intensive .",
    "the effect of the gap is much less pronounced and one might at least expect that the staggered magnetization will vanish for all @xmath1 , in correspondence with the results of @xcite . in future work",
    ", we will consider this kind of initial state as well as the time evolution of more elaborate observables .",
    "in the algebraic bethe ansatz the eigenstates are completely characterized by a set of rapidities @xmath43 , solutions to the bethe equations .",
    "these solutions can be either real or complex .",
    "the complex solutions typically come in groups , invariant under complex conjugation , which represent bound states . at a small density of down spins or large anisotropy @xmath16",
    ", most solutions take the form of so - called strings , in which a number of rapidities share a real centre while the imaginary parts are equally spaced according to the so - called string hypothesis .",
    "an @xmath25string takes the form :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is a deviation .",
    "when the string hypothesis holds ( i.e. when all deviations @xmath46 are sufficiently small ) the bethe equations can be rewritten as equations for the real parts of the rapidities only , yielding the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations @xcite . the logarithmic version of the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations for @xmath1 is given by @xmath47 with the dispersion and scattering kernels @xmath48 @xmath49 solutions of the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations can be classified by the set of quantum numbers @xmath50 , which are integers ( half - odd integers ) if @xmath51 is odd ( even ) . the partitioning into strings satisfies the constraint @xmath52 .",
    "the energy of an @xmath25string @xmath53 is @xmath54 the total energy and momentum of an eigenstate containing strings are given by @xmath55 @xmath56 for finite @xmath57 and large @xmath26 the energy @xmath58 becomes dispersionless .",
    "an @xmath25string can be interpreted as a magnon bound state with a mass proportional to @xmath26 .      in the thermodynamic limit @xmath59 the band structure",
    "is easily obtained from . for a given string configuration @xmath60",
    "one can define : @xmath61 by putting all @xmath53 to @xmath62 .",
    "similarly one can define @xmath63 by putting all @xmath53 to @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath27string is a special case since it has a vanishing bandwidth in the limit @xmath65 . in the ising limit ( @xmath66 )",
    "the energy of a state made of @xmath67 different strings is @xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds in the ising language to a state made of @xmath67 distinct blocks of down spins and clarifies the bound states interpretation in this limit .",
    "in order to evaluate the spectrum numerically a correspondence between quantum numbers and rapidities is needed . for the isotropic chain @xmath69",
    "every set of quantum numbers corresponds to a unique solution of the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations .",
    "a complete classification of solutions in terms of quantum numbers was given in @xcite .",
    "for the case of the xxz chain with @xmath70 this classification in not known in general . for solutions with only real solutions this was done in @xcite . here",
    "we generalize the result to string solutions .",
    "note that a genuine proof that the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations produce the right number of eigenstates for @xmath1 remains to be found .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that @xmath72 if @xmath73 .",
    "equal rapidities do not yield proper bethe wavefunctions , and we therefore only need to consider sets of distinct quantum numbers . in the parameterization chosen in the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations all rapidities are restricted to an interval of width @xmath74 , i.e. for all strings of given length @xmath26 we have : @xmath75 . from this requirement and",
    "assuming that the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations are monotonic in @xmath76 it follows that : @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "we call @xmath71 the bandwidth of the quantum numbers @xmath79 .      since @xmath81",
    "as far as the wavefunctions are concerned , there is no one - to - one mapping of quantum numbers and wavefunctions .",
    "namely , the shift @xmath82 leaves the wavefunction invariant although the quantum numbers in the bethe - gaudin - takahashi equations change . for every string length @xmath26",
    "we can define a transformation : @xmath83 with : @xmath84 from this transformation we see that @xmath85 . for every string length @xmath26",
    "there are @xmath86 bands of quantum numbers which can not be transformed into each other by @xmath87 , whereas in the xxx case there is only one such band for every string length .",
    "if we restrict to only one string length it follows that the number of choices for the quantum numbers @xmath88 in a single band is : @xmath89 . in case of @xmath80",
    "bands the number of solutions is : @xmath90      to find the minimal set of quantum numbers one should first determine using @xmath87 the bandwidth @xmath71 and the number of bands @xmath80 for every string length @xmath26 .",
    "however , the transformation @xmath87 not only affects the quantum numbers of length @xmath26 but also all the others . to take this effect into account one",
    "should also consider transformations of the form @xmath91 , leading to additional state exclusions .",
    "in general these are very difficult to determine . the explicit classification for two string types is given below .",
    "we consider @xmath67 @xmath25strings and @xmath92 @xmath93strings such that : @xmath94 .",
    "the bandwidths of the two sets of quantum numbers are : @xmath95 the number of bands are @xmath96 and @xmath97 . to take care of the degeneracies coming from different string sectors we consider the transformation : @xmath98 this turns out to be the only extra transformation one needs to consider .",
    "define : @xmath99 . from the conditions : @xmath100 and @xmath101 follows that we have to exclude : @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the total number of unique solutions for this case is @xmath104",

    "the norm of a bethe state in case of strings is given by @xcite : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is called the reduced gaudin matrix : @xmath122 an extremely useful formula is slavnov s expression for the scalar product between an eigenstate @xmath123 ( represented by a set of rapidities @xmath124 that satisfy the bethe equations ) and an arbitrary state @xmath125 ( without restrictions on @xmath126 ) @xcite : @xmath127 with @xmath128      the initial state can be written in the algebraic bethe ansatz language using the inverse mapping @xcite : @xmath129 making use of @xmath130 and @xmath131 we can write the state as : @xmath132 which is a normalized state . the overlap between an eigenstate for finite @xmath16 and the initial state @xmath133 can be computed using slavnov s theorem for the scalar product . in the case",
