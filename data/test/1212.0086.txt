    "<S> complex potential and non - hermitian hopping amplitude are building blocks of a non - hermitian quantum network . </S>",
    "<S> appropriate configuration , such as @xmath0-symmetric distribution , can lead to a full real spectrum . to investigate the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon , we study the phase diagrams of a semi - infinite non - hermitian systems . </S>",
    "<S> they consist of finite non - hermitian clusters and semi - infinite leads . based on the analysis of the solutions of the concrete systems </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that they can have full real spectra without any requirements on the symmetry and the wave function within the leads becomes unidirectional plane waves at the exceptional point . </S>",
    "<S> this universal dynamical behavior is demonstrated as the persistent emission and reflectionless absorption of wave packets in the typical non - hermitian systems containing the complex on - site potentials and non - hermitian hopping amplitudes . </S>"
