    "any conceivable theory of structure formation in the universe predicts statistical properties of observable quantities .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the present inhomogeneity of the universe is inevitably statistical .",
    "however , what kind of statistics is useful is not obvious , since we can invent infinite number of statistics to be analyzed .",
    "whether we can adopt better statistical descriptions is of great importance in this sense .",
    "each statistic has both advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the power spectrum , for example , can fully characterize the random gaussian fields , while it does not contain any information on the non - gaussianity , which contains significant information in the gravitational instability theory . among various statistical quantities",
    ", there is a promising class of statistics which utilizes smoothed cosmic fields .",
    "the smoothed field has less noisy property than the actual ( unsmoothed , or raw ) cosmic fields , such as galaxy distributions , temperature fluctuations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , shear fields of the gravitational lensing , and so forth .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of such statistics is the variance @xmath0 of smoothed density contrast @xmath1 , which is a function of smoothing length @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , higher - order cumulants @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are also simple statistics .",
    "the density probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath5 , which in principle can be constructed from the hierarchy of cumulants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is an another example of popular statistics of smoothed cosmic fields .",
    "rather recently , more complex statistics of smoothed cosmic fields have become popular in cosmology , such as the genus statistic @xcite , density peak statistics @xcite , area , length , level - crossing statistics @xcite , minkowski functionals @xcite , etc .",
    "these statistics provide assuring characterizations of the clustering pattern that can not be perceived only by the hierarchy of cumulants or by the pdf .",
    "the genus statistic is a powerful measure of the morphology in the 3-dimensional @xcite , and 2-dimensional @xcite clustering of galaxies and clusters , and also of the pattern of temperature fluctuations of cmb radiation @xcite .",
    "the peak statistics of the 3-dimensional density field are frequently used in connection with the statistics of the collapsing object @xcite , while the peak statistics of the cmb fluctuations @xcite and of the weak lensing fields @xcite are suitable for constraining cosmological models .",
    "the area , length , and level - crossing statistics directly quantify the amount of contour surfaces @xcite .",
    "the minkowski functionals @xcite , which are closely related to the above statistics , are also applied to smoothed cosmic fields @xcite .",
    "these statistics of smoothed density fields are considered as powerful descriptors of the statistical information of the universe .",
    "it is therefore essential to establish theoretical predictions of the behavior of such statistics so that we can effectively and ideally analyze the data of our universe .",
    "recent developments of the perturbation theory ( for review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in calculating the variance , the cumulants , and the pdf are remarkable .",
    "the perturbation theory becomes more and more useful because the recent developments of observations enable us to have widely covered sample volume of the universe , which can minimize undesirable strongly nonlinear effects which we do not understand well .",
    "the direct comparison of the theoretical predictions of the perturbation theory with the actual data is a promising field of research in this sense . in the case of top - hat smoothing function",
    ", @xcite and @xcite used the tree - level ( i.e. , lowest - order ) perturbation theory to obtain the third- and forth - order cumulants , i.e. , the skewness and the kurtosis .",
    "the same quantities with gaussian smoothing are calculated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quite cleverly , @xcite took advantage of special properties of the top - hat smoothing function , and succeeded to obtain full hierarchy of higher order moments in the tree - level perturbation theory .",
    "he also obtained the pdf from this hierarchy of cumulants , which remarkably describes the nonlinear behavior of the gravitational instability in numerical simulations . beyond the tree - level calculation ,",
    "the perturbation theory with loop - corrections has been also developed @xcite .",
    "because of the simplicity of the statistics , calculating the variance , the cumulants and the pdf were primarily the playground of perturbation - theorists .",
    "the evaluation of other statistics by the perturbation theory is less trivial .",
    "a quite useful technique is the edgeworth expansion , which was first applied to cosmology in calculating the pdf from seeds perturbations by @xcite , and from non - linear perturbation theory by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the analytic expression of the genus statistics in the perturbation theory is derived by @xcite , whose technique corresponds to multivariate version of the edgeworth expansion . in some literatures",
    "the edgeworth expansion is used in connecting the statistics and dynamics of the universe @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a comprehensive description of the formalism by which the perturbative evaluation is possible for wide range of non - trivial statistics of smoothed cosmic fields in general .    since the number of spatial dimensions of our universe is three , the statistics of large - scale cosmic fields are defined in either one- , two- , or three - dimensional space .",
    "for example , the space of the density field in a redshift map of galaxies or quasars is three - dimensional .",
    "a projected galaxy map on the sky , a shear field of gravitational lensing , and temperature fluctuations of cmb on the sky are fields in two - dimensional space .",
    "the absorption lines of quasar spectra and pencil - beam surveys of galaxies define fields in one - dimensional space .",
    "thus it is useful to develop our statistical method in @xmath6-dimensions for generality .",
    "as illustrative examples of applications of our method , we calculate level - crossing statistic ( or equivalently length and area statistics ) , genus statistics , density - extrema statistics and minkowski functionals . as cosmic fields ,",
    "we consider density and velocity fields in three dimensions , the projected density field of galaxies in two dimensions . the basic formalism and results of the second order theory",
    "are presented in this paper .",
    "we will give results of the third order theory in a future paper , which are technically more involved .",
    "the primary purpose of the present paper is to fully describe the basic formalism for the statistics of smoothed cosmic fields in perturbation theory .",
    "applications of the second order theory to popular statistics and cosmic fields are systematically presented .",
    "thus , this paper is in some way a mixture of the new results and comprehensive review of the old results .",
    "the major new results in this paper are :    * explicit formulas of the lowest non - gaussian correction in various smoothed cosmic fields in @xmath6-dimensions , including all the minkowski functionals .",
    "they are presented as functions of both density threshold and rescaled threshold by volume - fraction . *",
    "relations among several statistics of the smoothed field are clarified .",
    "* derivatives of skewness parameter of the velocity field and projected 2d field are derived in second order perturbation theory of gravitational instability theory .",
    "especially , skewness parameters with gaussian smoothing are detailed .",
    "these quantities are particularly important to perturbatively evaluate the statistics of smoothed field .",
    "* genus curve against the scaled threshold in perturbation theory is discussed and a theory - motivated new asymmetry parameter in genus curve is introduced .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way .",
    " [ sec2 ] and  [ sec3 ] are carrying out a mathematical exercise of expressing high - order terms in terms of skewness parameters ; the physics of gravity only enters once one actually calculates the skewness parameters in  [ sec4 ] . thus ",

    "we consider a cosmic random field @xmath7 which represents any field constructed from observable quantities of the universe , such as three - dimensional density field , velocity field , or two - dimensional projected density field , shear or convergence field of weak lensing , temperature fluctuations of cmb , etc .",
    "the coordinates @xmath8 can be either three- , two- , or one - dimensions .",
    "we assume the field @xmath9 is already smoothed by a smoothing function @xmath10 with smoothing length @xmath2 which cuts the high frequency fluctuations which suffer strongly nonlinear effects : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dimension of the space @xmath8 , and @xmath13 is a raw , unsmoothed field .",
    "two of the most popular 3d smoothing functions are the tophat smoothing function @xmath14 and the gaussian smoothing function @xmath15 we also assume that the mean value of the field @xmath9 is zero , and that the existence the variance @xmath16 : @xmath17 it is convenient to introduce a normalized field @xmath18 which has a unit variance as follows : @xmath19      the statistics of a smoothed cosmic field we are interested in are the functions of the field @xmath18 and its spatial derivatives as we will see in the following sections .",

    "only the value of the field and of the derivatives on a single point is considered , but in general , more than two points can be considered .",
    "the set @xmath25 forms multivariate random fields , which is denoted as an @xmath26-dimensional vector @xmath27 in the following .",
    "the dimension @xmath26 is the total number of derivatives which appear in the definition of the statistics we are interested in .",
    "the statistical information is described by the multivariate pdf , @xmath28 .",
    "the fourier transform of the pdf is the partition function : @xmath29 at this point , the cumulant expansion theorem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is very useful .",
    "this theorem states that @xmath30 is the generating function of the cumulants , @xmath31 : @xmath32 it follows from @xmath33 that @xmath34 , and first several cumulants are given by @xmath35 and so forth . from equations ( [ eq1 - 6 ] ) and ( [ eq1 - 7a ] ) , the partition function is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an @xmath38 matrix whose components are given by @xmath39 .",
    "on the other hand , the equation ( [ eq1 - 5 ] ) is inverted as @xmath40 substituting @xmath41 in the last term of equation ( [ eq1 - 8 ] ) , the distribution function of equation ( [ eq1 - 9 ] ) can be transformed in a form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the multivariate gaussian distribution function characterized by the correlation matrix @xmath37 .",
    "any statistical quantity of a smoothed cosmic field is expressed by an average @xmath44 of a certain function @xmath45 as we will see in the following sections .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ eq1 - 10 ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the averaging by the gaussian distribution function of equation ( [ eq1 - 11b ] ) .",
    "this form , equation ( [ eq1 - 12b ] ) , is useful when the deviation from the gaussian distribution is not large . in principle",
    ", this equation reduces the general statistical averaging procedure to gaussian integrations .",
    "however , it contains the infinite series , thus we have to truncate this expression by some criteria . in most cases of interest ,",
    "the weakly nonlinear evolution of cosmic fields satisfy @xmath48 , as we will see in   [ sec4 ] .",
    "when this relation holds , we can expand the distribution function to arbitrary order in @xmath49 . in the following ,",
    "we assume this relation , and introduce the normalized cumulants : @xmath50 which are assumed to be of order one in terms of @xmath49 . in this case , the equation ( [ eq1 - 12b ] ) is expanded as , up to @xmath51 , @xmath52 { \\sigma_0}^2     + { \\cal o}({\\sigma_0}^3 ) , \\label{eq1 - 13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the notation , @xmath53 etc .",
    "the calculation of the factors @xmath54 is performed for individual statistic which gives the explicit form of the function @xmath55 .      in the expansion of equation ( [ eq1 - 13 ] )",
    ", we need to calculate the gaussian average of derivatives of the function @xmath55 : @xmath56 in most cases , the evaluation is analytically feasible because only gaussian integration is needed . for the evaluation of such integration , we need the correlation matrix @xmath37 . throughout this paper , we consider statistically homogeneous , and isotropic fields , in which case , the correlation matrix @xmath37 is simplified because of the symmetry .",
    "in fact , the correlation matrix takes the following forms : @xmath57 where @xmath58 etc . and we define the following quantities : @xmath59 in most cases of interest , the derivatives of order higher than two do not appear in the definition of the statistics , so we do not give explicit form of those correlations .    in the following , we use the notation @xmath60 and @xmath61 following @xcite . as is often the case , when the second order derivatives @xmath62 appears in @xmath55 as simple polynomials , the following transform is particularly useful : @xmath63 this transform erase the correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath64 , and the non - zero correlations are only @xmath65 where @xmath66 the gaussian integration is straightforward if the function @xmath55 is expressed by polynomials of @xmath64 .",
    "if the function @xmath55 is more complicated in which @xmath62 are not simply given by polynomials , it is useful to completely diagonalize the correlation matrix @xmath37 of equations ( [ eq1 - 13 - 2a])([eq1 - 13 - 2a ] ) .",

    "the @xmath546-value per degrees of freedom reduces to only 1.03 ( private communication with w. n. colley & d. h. weinberg ) .",

    "this fact is empirically known by the analyses of numerical simulations @xcite . the reason for this reduction is mathematically due to the closeness of the values of skewness parameters @xmath87 , ( @xmath523 ) , since all the terms of the nonlinear corrections in equations ( [ eq2 - 207a])([eq2 - 207c ] ) depend only on @xmath239 ( @xmath547 ) . for the hierarchical model of equation ( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) , they are exactly zero , that means there is not any ( second order ) nonlinear correction for the hierarchical model .",

    "although their variation of smoothing length is rather limited , their plots ensures the slight meat - ball shift predicted by the perturbation theory can definitely be observed .",

    "<S> we formulate a general method for perturbative evaluations of statistics of smoothed cosmic fields , and provide useful formulas in application of the perturbation theory to various statistics . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism is an extensive generalization of the method used by @xcite who derived a weakly nonlinear formula of the genus statistic in a 3d density field . after describing the general method </S>",
    "<S> , we apply the formalism to a series of statistics , including genus statistics , level - crossing statistics , minkowski functionals , and a density extrema statistic , regardless of the dimensions in which each statistic is defined . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the minkowski functionals and other geometrical statistics is clarified . </S>",
    "<S> these statistics can be applied to several cosmic fields , including 3d density field , 3d velocity field , 2d projected density field , and so forth . </S>",
    "<S> the results are detailed for second order theory of the formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the bias is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of smoothed cosmic fields as functions of rescaled threshold by volume - fraction are discussed in the framework of second - order perturbation theory . in cdm - like models , </S>",
    "<S> their functional deviations from linear predictions plotted against the rescaled threshold are generally much smaller than that plotted against the direct threshold . </S>",
    "<S> there is still slight meat - ball shift against rescaled threshold , which is characterized by asymmetry in depths of troughs in the genus curve . </S>",
    "<S> a theory - motivated asymmetry factor in genus curve is proposed . </S>"
