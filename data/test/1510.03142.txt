    "sec : ftqc ] ) , however it may require more feedforward operations than gate teleportation .",
    "the effects of photon losses should be also considered for the implementations of quantum computing .",
    "a logically encoded qubit with @xmath3 photons may be affected by losses during the in - line process , resulting in the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolved ] ) , which contains some logical errors . when performing gate teleportation for the hadamard and cz gate operations , the success probability of bell measurement is also deteriorated by photon losses .",
    "here we assume that the resource channels @xmath156 and @xmath161 are prepared at off - line and immediately used such that only the input qubits are subjected to losses .",
    "in this case , the bell measurement fails with rate @xmath162 when @xmath135 photons are lost in the qubit .",
    "thus , we can calculate the success probability of the gate teleportation with loss rate @xmath124 as @xmath163 where @xmath133 represents the binomial coefficient .",
    "it becomes @xmath164 when there is no loss @xmath144 , and @xmath165 for @xmath146 .",
    "it is higher than the one obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ktimesfail ] ) as we assumed here that loss occurs only at the input qubit modes ( no loss at the channel states ) .    during the computation process",
    ", several errors are caused by photon losses .",
    "some of the errors are detectable by measurements during the gate operations , which are called `` locatable '' @xcite , while other errors propagates and can only be corrected by an error correction code .",
    "this latter kind are called `` unlocatable '' . as we can see in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolved ] ) , losses occur with the rate @xmath166 in quantum memory or gate operations . if any single photon is lost , the logical qubit experiences a pauli @xmath139 error with probability @xmath140 . the loss errors in quantum memory as well as deterministic operations such as",
    "the pauli @xmath167 or arbitrary @xmath139 rotation , are unlocatable . on the other hand ,",
    "the errors in hadamard or cz gates caused by losses are in fact immediately detectable by missing photons at the detectors during the logical bell measurement . moreover , as the gate teleportation scheme is used here , missing photons in the input qubit are compensated at the output qubit as far as the teleportation succeeds .",
    ".[tab : table1]fault - tolerant noise thresholds ( @xmath124 ) for different numbers of photons in a logical qubit ( @xmath3 ) using the seven - qubit steane code and the telecorrection protocol @xcite .",
    "the highest threshold is obtained when @xmath149 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to build arbitrary large - scale quantum computers , it should be justified that they can be implemented with tolerance to small errors , so - called fault - tolerance @xcite . for this",
    ", the amount of noise per operation with appropriate error corrections should be below a fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "we thus carried out numerical simulations to obtain the threshold for our scheme with a given loss rate @xmath124 .",
    "we here employ the seven qubit steane code @xcite with several levels of concatenation based on the circuit - based telecorrection @xcite , in order to directly compare its performance with previous other schemes employing the same correction code and circuit @xcite .",
    "note that the steane code can correct arbitrary logical or unlocatable errors , but for the purpose of this calculation we assume that the other errors are negligible compared to the loss errors .",
    "we will employ the modified telecorrection circuit composed of cz , hadamard , @xmath168 state , and @xmath167-basis measurement @xcite .",
    "let us define the error model for our approach as follows : when hadamard or cz gates fail , the output qubit is assumed to experience depolarization , which can be modeled by a random pauli operation , _",
    "i.e. _ pauli @xmath139 and @xmath167 operation independently act on the logical qubit with the equal probability @xmath140 .",
    "for the other loss errors in quantum memory or gate operations , pauli @xmath139 operation is applied to the qubit with probability @xmath140 .",
    "we use this error model for the lowest level of concatenation , while the same error models described in ref .",
    "@xcite is used for higher levels of concatenation .",
    "based on this approach , we performed a series of monte carlo simulation ( using c++ ) to obtain the corrected error rates for a range of @xmath124 with different @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting corrected error rates in a lower level are used for the error rates for the elements used in next level of error correction .",
    "if the error rates tend to zero in the limit of many levels of concatenation , it is guaranteed that in principle the fault - tolerant quantum computation is possible with those certain @xmath124 and @xmath3 .    in this way",
    ", the noise thresholds of our scheme with different @xmath3 are obtained as shown in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "interestingly , the largest threshold is obtained when the logical qubit is encoded with four photons ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "note that a further increase of @xmath3 lowers the threshold , which may be due to unlocatable errors becoming dominant for larger @xmath3 encoding .",
    "let us then compare the result with those obtained by other schemes .",
    "the threshold obtained by our scheme ( @xmath169 ) is much higher than those for coherent - state qubits ( @xmath170 ) @xcite and optical hybrid qubits ( @xmath171 ) @xcite . on the other hand , it is almost equivalent to the one using parity states encoding with entangled photons @xcite .",
    "even much higher thresholds may be attainable by employing recently proposed topological error codes @xcite , which will be a possible future work .",
    "the number of resources required for one round of error correction is another important factor to analyze the scalability of quantum computation .",
    "one can estimate the resource requirements of the telecorrection scheme by the following estimation .",
    "the total number of operations in one round of telecorrection is about 1,000 @xcite and the element operations are used with the following fractions @xcite : memory 0.284 , hadamard 0.098 , cz 0.343 , diagonal state 0.164 , and x - basis measurement 0.111 .",
    "if we assume that the number @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 of resources are consumed to prepare the hadamard , cz gate , and the diagonal state , respectively , and none for the others . then , the total resource requirements for one round of error corrections is obtained by @xmath175 in fact , it depends on the form of the required entangled states and the efficiency of their generation methods . in our scheme , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : ugo ] , the entangled states @xmath156 and @xmath161 are used as the channel for gate teleportation to realize hadamard and cz gate , respectively . if we assume conditional generation of @xmath156 and @xmath161 from entangled photon pairs _",
    "e.g. _ using the fusion gate operation @xcite , the resource cost increases exponentially with increasing @xmath3 the number of photon in a logical qubit . on the other hand ,",
    "any on - demand or efficient generation scheme for such multiphoton entanglement will be able to reduce dramatically the resource requirements .",
    "recently , such multiphoton entanglement has been experimentally produced @xcite .",
    "for example , ghz entanglement up to eight photons @xcite and cluster states up to eight photons @xcite have been successfully generated .",
    "several on - demand generation schemes were proposed theoretically @xcite and are expected to be realized , e.g. , based on semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "we have presented a detailed scheme for nearly deterministic bell measurement using multiphoton entanglement and linear optics proposed in ref .",
    "the limitation that only two of four bell states can be identified by the standard bell measurement , @xmath19 , is overcome by the ghz type of multiphoton entanglement and @xmath3 times of @xmath19 measurements , where @xmath3 is the number of photons in a logical qubit .",
    "the logical bell measurement is performed through @xmath3 times of @xmath19 measurements , and it fails only when none of those @xmath3 times of @xmath19 measurements succeeds .",
    "therefore , the success probability of the logical bell measurement is given as @xmath4 , which rapidly approaches to unity as @xmath3 increases .",
    "we have compared the efficiency of our scheme with those of other previous schemes proposed to improve the success probabilities of bell measurement based on linear optics ; several schemes were proposed based on single photon qubits @xcite or other optical qubits such as coherent state @xcite and optical hybrid qubits @xcite .",
    "we showed that our scheme outperforms other schemes employing single photon qubits , with respect to the attained success probability in terms of the average number of photons used in the process .",
    "although the scheme using coherent state or optical hybrid qubits achieves higher success probability than ours by consuming the same number of photons on average , a considerable advantage of our scheme over all the other schemes is that it does not require photon number resolving detections but only photon on - off detection suffices .",
    "we have demonstrated that our scheme can be effectively used for the implementation of quantum teleportation and all - optical quantum computation .",
    "the success probability of quantum teleportation increases rapidly to unity as increasing @xmath3 the number of photons in the qubit and channel states .",
    "we showed that in our approach fault - tolerant quantum computation is possible under photon losses .",
    "it is remarkable that the highest noise - threshold is obtained with four - photon encoded qubits and eight - photon entangled channels that are accessible within current technologies @xcite .",
    "for example , 8 photon ghz entangled states have been recently generated successfully in optics laboratories @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our bell measurement scheme can be implemented via either spatially or temporally distributed and independent @xmath3 times @xmath19 measurements .",
    "such an experiment may be considered not only with spatially separated @xmath3-mode entangled states but also with temporal mode entanglement as done in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a temporally",
    "distributed implementation , only one standard bell - measurement device illustrated in fig.[fig : scheme](a ) @xcite will be sufficient to perform independent @xmath3 times of @xmath19 measurements for a logical bell measurement .",
    "we finally note that our idea for a distributed bell measurement scheme , in principle , is not limited to photonic qubits but can be applied to any multipartite systems with other physical degrees of freedom .",
    "our works reveals the possibility of using multipartite entanglement for efficient quantum communication and computation .",
    "we would like to note that the comparison in our paper with other schemes @xcite does not rule out their own advantages for the implementation of bell measurement with linear optics .",
