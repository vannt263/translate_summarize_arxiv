    "lanthanum manganite ( lamno@xmath0 ) is a distorted perovskite material whose electronic and magnetic properties have potential technological use in a variety of applications such as pseudo - capacitors , batteries , and spintronics @xcite .",
    "electron - electron correlation and lattice distortion effects are among the main drivers behind the appearance of these properties @xcite , which depend on a number of parameters such as pressure , doping , and temperature .",
    "of particular interest is the onset of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) that can appear upon application of a large hydrostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "this pressure induces a phase separated ( ps ) state characterized by the coexistence of different magnetic and structural domains .",
    "the ps state along with half - metallic character have been suggested by several authors to be key for optimizing the cmr state in manganites @xcite .",
    "cmr is a phenomena characterized by large changes in electrical resistance in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "hole - doped lamno@xmath0 compounds ( la@xmath3a@xmath4mno@xmath0 , where a = ca , sr , ba ) feature the largest reported cmr effect , which is several orders of magnitude larger than that of other systems @xcite . in these materials ,",
    "cmr can be observed either at the phase transition from a ferromagnetic ( fm ) half - metallic state to paramagnetic ( pm ) insulating state or in the melting of the charge - orbital ordered state @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of cmr in the stoichiometric lamno@xmath0 under 32 gpa of hydrostatic pressure @xcite demonstrates the possibility of obtaining this effect in the ordered lamno@xmath0 compound .",
    "however , the cmr effect reported in this experiment was significantly reduced , probably because the system was not in a half - metallic state . the half - metallic domains necessary for achieving the optimal effect",
    "are predicted to occur at very high hydrostatic pressures , in excess of 100 gpa @xcite , clearly showing the need to devise alternative strategies that would require more manageable applied strains .    in this paper ,",
    "we show that the pressure needed to obtain a fm half - metallic state is reduced by an order of magnitude when the pressure is applied along a single axis ( uniaxial ) .",
    "we also show that the mechanism associated with the insulator - to - metal ( imt ) , structural , and magnetic phase transitions observed in this system are mainly controlled by a particular jahn - teller ( jt ) mode , as previously highlighted @xcite .",
    "this identification of a particular phonon - type mode , provides a clear strategy for tuning properties in other systems where such structural distortions exist .    in its ground - state , lamno@xmath0 forms a pbnm orthorhombic structure with an a - type antiferromagnetic ( a - afm ) insulator character ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the crystal structure contains tilted and rotated mno@xmath5 octahedra along with cooperative jt instabilities characterized by two short ( @xmath6 = 1.903 ) , two long ( @xmath7 = 2.184 ) , and two medium ( @xmath8 = 1.957 ) mn - o bond distances @xcite .",
    "these distortions lift the degeneracy of the singly occupied e@xmath9 orbital and stabilize the system into an orbital - ordered state @xcite .",
    "hole - doping or raising the temperature produce a @xmath2 structure with fm half - metallic character @xcite and small volume decrease of 2 - 4@xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , applying 32 gpa of hydrostatic pressure drives the system to a fm metal ( but not a half - metal ) with a significantly reduced cmr behavior  in comparison to the hole - doped manganites  and with an associated 14@xmath10 decrease in volume leaving the pbnm crystal structure unchanged @xcite .",
    "dft calculations have shown that the highly desired half - metallic state can be obtained in the _ pseudo - cubic _ structure by applying hydrostatic pressures @xmath11 100 gpa @xcite with an associated drastic reduction in volume of @xmath1 35@xmath10 .",
    "as we will show , these large pressures and volume reductions can be significantly reduced by the application of uniaxial pressure while maintaining a fm half - metallic _ pseudo - cubic _ phase .    in our previous work on lamno@xmath0 @xcite , we established that the q2 jt mode plays a dominant role in the transition from the low - t afm insulating state to the high - t fm half - metallic state with the q3 mode playing a secondary role .",
    "in addition , we observe a 2.9@xmath10 reduction of the @xmath12 lattice parameter and an expansion of both @xmath13 ( 0.8@xmath10 ) and @xmath14 ( 2.8@xmath10 ) lattice parameters that produces a modest @xmath1 2.6@xmath10 reduction in volume .",
    "combining these two key pieces of information leads to the hypothesis that by applying uniaxial pressure along the @xmath12 lattice direction ( [ 010 ] ) the pressure needed for obtaining the @xmath2 fm half - metallic state can be significantly reduced .",
    "specifically , our simulations show there exists strong competition between the fm and afm magnetic states for a range of uniaxial pressure values that could indicate the emergence of a possible phase coexistence , and hence , the likely realization of cmr at considerably lower pressure .",
    "the manifestation of fm half - metallic character with the possibility of a cmr state at relevant technological pressures in the stoichiometric lamno@xmath0 compound could have a significant impact on spintronic applications .    unlike the system under high pressure , which lowers its free - energy by creating interfaces ( domains , etc . ) , it is unclear whether such a ps state exists at low pressure .",
    "we will address this particular aspect and highlight the possible coexistence of magnetic and structural features that occur for a specific range of uniaxial pressure near the phase transition .",
    "the application of compressive uniaxial strain has been investigated for a large variety of materials , with the goal of tuning and optimizing the electronic and magnetic properties @xcite , but only a few studies on lamno@xmath0 have been reported to - date .",
    "these studies were focused on providing an interpretation of experiments on epitaxially grown lamno@xmath0 @xcite and therefore , only applied small uniaxial strains of the order of 2@xmath10 or less were considered .",
    "it should be mentioned that biaxial in - plane strains have also been applied with the same purpose in a strain range of up to @xmath15 4@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "note that larger strains will not allow high quality epitaxial growth and therefore , have not been studied .",
    "moreover , all reported strain - engineering studies on lamno@xmath0 were not able to see the possibility of using strain to obtain a half - metallic state .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first time any research has been undertaken to investigate the uniaxial compressive strain and find that @xmath1 5@xmath10 of compressive strain along the [ 010 ] direction is needed to obtain a pseudo - cubic fm half - metallic state in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the small afm - fm energy differences obtained over 4@xmath10 show the emergence of a possible phase coexistence , that along with the half - metallic character , may lead to the realization of a cmr effect .",
    "the possibility of forming a half - metallic state under uniaxial pressure is appealing since , under uniaxial pressure , both the @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattice parameters can relax to allow for a much smaller reduction in volume .",
    "in contrast , hydrostatic pressure is applied uniformly in all directions and leads to a large volume change .",
    "similarly , one would expect a larger reduction in volume when applying biaxial strain , since the area in the plane where the pressure is applied is reduced , allowing only one direction to relax and/or reconstruct .",
    "weather the ps state can be formed , what type of ps state is obtained , and if this structure is well - suited for the manifestation of cmr effect are open questions that remain to be addressed . in this work ,",
    "we identify a range of values for the @xmath12 lattice parameters where afm - fm energy differences are significantly small ( < 20 mev ) .",
    "these small magnetic energy differences suggest the possibility of a phase coexistence that may support a ps state .",
    "if this situation can be achieved then it may lead to the realization of a cmr state with optimal transport properties .",
    "we used the replicated - data version of the crystal14 computational package @xcite .",
    "crystal14 is a first - principles electronic structure software package that employs atom - centered gaussian - type orbital ( gto ) basis sets to build the bloch functions to expand the one - electron crystalline orbitals @xcite .",
    "gtos have the advantage of being a local basis set with minimal overlap with neighboring gto s .",
    "this property provides a high degree of computational performance for calculating the hartree - fock exchange ( hfx ) .",
    "the numerical cost scales at a rate between _ n@xmath16-n@xmath17 _ , whereas plane - waves based methods scale as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of atoms making up the system .",
    "this significant improvement in computational performance allows for the simulation of large - scale systems using hybrid dft functionals .",
    "this is an important improvement since the accurate description of the electron - electron correlation in lamno@xmath0 can not be achieved with local or semi - local functionals .",
    "a pbe hybrid functional @xcite based on a mixing of 10@xmath10 hfx with 90@xmath10 pbe exchange potential ( pbe-10 ) has been employed for all calculations .",
    "this particular functional has been shown to accurately capture a range of electron - electron correlation effects governing the physics of lamno@xmath0 systems .",
    "this includes the a - afm insulating ground - state to the high temperature fm half - metallic state @xcite . to confirm the broad applicability of this hybrid functional , we first established that it reproduces the imt observed for an hydrostatic pressure ( see appendix ) .",
    "all - electron gto s were used for all atoms comprising the lamno@xmath0 system . for mn ,",
    "the 6 - 411d41 g atomic basis set generated by towler _",
    "was used @xcite .",
    "this basis includes 1s , 4sp , and 2d contractions .",
    "for the o we used the 8 - 411d basis set constructed by cor @xcite .",
    "it contains 1s , 3sp and 1d orbital contractions . for la , the 61111sp-631d basis set with 1s , 6sp , and 3d contractions",
    "was obtained from the crystal14 repository @xcite with the addition of two 4f electron shells to better account for the la - o and mn - o covalency induced by the octahedral rotations found in this system @xcite . for our calculations",
    "a 8 @xmath20 8 @xmath20 8 monkhorst - pack mesh @xcite was utilized to generate a 170 k - points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "tolerances of 10@xmath21 ( itol1 , itol2 , itol3 , and itol4 , using notations from ref . ) and 10@xmath22 ( itol5 ) were used for the bielectronic coulomb and hf exchange series integrals .",
    "these settings were found to ensure a convergence of 0.001 ev . the total energy convergence threshold between geometry optimization steps",
    "was set to 10@xmath23 ha .",
    "to study the electronic structure and magnetic properties of lamno@xmath0 under uniaxial pressure along the @xmath12 axis , we performed constrained geometry relaxation where we fixed the @xmath12 lattice parameter and relaxed the @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattice parameters and all atomic coordinates . manually changing the @xmath12 lattice parameter allows for the investigation of different compressive strains applied parallel to the [ 010 ] direction . the convergence criterion on gradient components and nuclear displacements",
    "was set to 0.0003 ha / bohr and 0.0012 bohr respectively .",
    "we study the competition between different magnetic orderings as a function of @xmath12 lattice parameter ( subsection a ) and provide the structural ( subsection b ) , magnetic and electronic ( subsection c ) properties of lamno@xmath0 under uniaxial compressive strain along the [ 010 ] direction .",
    "we demonstrate that at a critical value of @xmath12 = 5.52 , all these properties undergo a simultaneous phase transition due to the strong interplay among electronic , structural , and magnetic interactions .",
    "finally , we quantify the uniaxial pressure needed to achieve this transition ( subsection d ) .",
    "[ [ a .- competition - between - different - magnetic - phases - under - uniaxial - compressive - strain ] ] a. competition between different magnetic phases under uniaxial compressive strain ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    to determine the relative stability between all possible magnetic states as a function of compressive strain along [ 010 ] direction , we performed simulations on the three possible afm spin orderings : a - afm , c - afm , and g - afm . figure 2 displays the energy of these possible afm configurations and the fm magnetic ordering relative to the a - afm state as a function of decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "fm and a - afm magnetic phases exhibit the lowest energy for all considered compressive strains between @xmath24@xmath25 = 0 and 7@xmath10 . within this range of strains ,",
    "g - afm and c - afm stabilize at a much higher energy ( over 200 mev ) corresponding to a temperature of over 2300 k. thus , we will omit further analysis of these magnetic phases and the notation a - afm and afm will be used interchangeably from this point on .    we observe that the total energy difference between the afm and fm states ( defined as _ @xmath26e = e@xmath27-e@xmath28 _ ) decreases with decreasing @xmath12 . at a critical value of @xmath29 , a magnetic phase transition from afm to fm state occurs , which corresponds to a compressive strain of @xmath24@xmath25 = 5@xmath10 ( marked by the symbol `` x '' on fig .",
    "additional increases in compression strain further stabilizes the fm phase .",
    "the relatively small difference between the afm and fm states in a narrow range of @xmath12 values near the transition suggests the possible presence of a particular state characterized by the existence of different magnetic domains . as we will show later , this phase transition is accompanied by an imt and a significant reduction of the jt distortions , especially the q2 mode , which is very sensitive to the in - plane lattice parameters .      turning to the structural properties as a function of uniaxial compressive strain",
    ", we studied the evolution of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattice parameters as a function of decreasing @xmath12 as shown in fig . 3a . for small values of compressive strain in the range of @xmath24@xmath25",
    "= 0 to @xmath1 4@xmath10 ( from @xmath12 = 5.81 to 5.55 ) , we observe a progressive linear expansion of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameters with @xmath14 increasing slightly more than @xmath13 .",
    "this indicates a slight anisotropic compressive effect on the lamno@xmath0 structure .",
    "when the compressive strain is increased further , small instabilities break the linearity at a value of @xmath24@xmath25 @xmath1 4 - 5@xmath10 . at @xmath12 = 5.52",

    "sharp contraction of @xmath14 and expansion of @xmath13 are observed with a corresponding small volume increase .",
    "this uniaxial strain produces nearly equal @xmath13 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14/@xmath30 parameters , which indicates the transition from an orthorhombic to a @xmath2 structure .",
    "this structural transformation is accompanied by an afm insulator to fm half - metal phase transition ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    q2 and q3 are the two jt distortions that play a major part in the lamno@xmath0 phase transition ( fig .",
    "q2 is an in - plane distortion mode while q3 represents an octahedral stretching mode @xcite .",
    "these modes are responsible for splitting the mn 3d - e@xmath9 levels , which is necessary for obtaining an afm insulating state .",
    "while q3 shows a similar evolution for both afm and fm states as a function of @xmath12 , q2 displays marked differences between the two magnetic states . in the afm phase",
    ", q2 has a nearly linear behavior with a negative slope while the fm phase displays significant non - linear structure with an abrupt change at the structural transition . in other words ,",
