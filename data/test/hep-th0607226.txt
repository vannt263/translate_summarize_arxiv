    "inflation offers a simple solution to the shortcomings of the standard hot big bang model .",
    "in addition , its predictions about the initial density perturbations , leading to the observed structure formation , are in a remarkable agreement with measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies . among the various inflationary models ,",
    "one should select the ones which lead to a better agreement with data , with the additional requirement that such models should be naturally built within a fundamental theoretical framework . in spite of its enormous success",
    ", inflation remains still a paradigm in search of a model .    despite the elegance of chaotic inflation  @xcite",
    ", this simple model faces a fine tuning problem .",
    "consistency , between predictions for the amplitude of cmb temperature anisotropies and measurements , requires a tiny coupling constant . to avoid this problem ,",
    "linde  @xcite has proposed hybrid inflation , a model of inflation based on einstein gravity , but driven by a false vacuum . in this model ,",
    "the inflaton field rolls while another scalar field remains trapped in a false vacuum state .",
    "the false vacuum becomes unstable when the magnitude of the inflaton field falls below some critical value , leading to a phase transition to the true vacuum .",
    "the energy density is dominated by the false vacuum energy density so that the phase transition signals the end of hybrid inflation .",
    "the phase transition at the end of inflation leads to topological defect formation  @xcite .",
    "theoretically motivated inflationary models can be built in a context of supersymmetry ( susy ) and supergravity ( sugra ) theories .",
    "@xmath1 supersymmetric models contain complex scalar fields , which often have flat directions in their potential , thus offering natural candidates for inflationary models . in this framework , hybrid inflation ( driven by the f - terms or the d - terms ) are the most standard models .",
    "such inflationary models lead generically to cosmic string formation at the end of the inflationary era .",
    "cosmic strings in supersymmetric theories may have new properties , as compared to their non - supersymmetric counterparts ; we do not address this issue here .",
    "a gauge symmetry can be broken spontaneously in @xmath1 globally supersymmetric theories , either by adding f - terms to the superpotential or , in the abelian case , by introducing fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) d - terms .",
    "the higgs mechanism leads generically  @xcite to abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) strings . depending whether they were formed at the end of f- or d - term inflation",
    "they are called f - term or d - term strings , respectively . f - term inflation is potentially plagued with the @xmath0-problem , while d - term inflation avoids it .",
    "this problem arises from the presence of large corrections ( of the order of the hubble parameter during inflation ) to the inflaton mass , which spoil the required flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "d - term inflation can be successfully implemented in the framework of sugra , while in addition , it can be easily accommodated within string theory models .    in the simplest models of d - term inflation within sugra , in which the constant fi term gets compensated by a single complex scalar field at the end of the inflationary era , the d - term strings formed at the end of inflation are topologically stable , since @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the vacuum manifold of the broken u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "our study concerns such models .",
    "however , they have been proposed  @xcite models where d - term strings can become unstable . for example",
    ", one can introduce additional matter multiplets so as to obtain a non - trivial global symmetry such as su(2 ) , leading to a simply connected vacuum manifold and the production of semi - local strings .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested  @xcite that the waterfall higgs fields are non - trivially charged under some other gauge symmetries @xmath4 , such that the vacuum manifold , @xmath5/ u(1)$ ] , is simply connected , leading to the formation of semi - local strings .",
    "d - term inflation requires the existence of a non - zero constant fi term , which can be added to the lagrangian only in the presence of a u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "this extra u(1 ) symmetry can be of a different origin .",
    "some models have been suggested for field - dependent fi terms , arising in the presence of a chiral superfield @xmath6 shifting under u(1 ) . the imaginary part of the scalar part of the chiral superfield plays the rle of an axion , and cancels the chiral anomaly by shifting under the u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "such a u(1 ) symmetry is called _ anomalous _ , or _ pseudo - anomalous _ since the total anomaly vanishes . here",
    "the fi term depends on the real part of the chiral superfield . in supersymmetry ,",
    "models with anomalous fi terms have been developed  @xcite within heterotic string theory . in a cosmological setup",
    "one has first to assume the stabilisation of the chiral superfield @xmath6 ; the rle of @xmath6 may be played by any modulus ( a dilaton or any volume modulus ) .",
    "only if this assumption holds the dilaton - dependent d - term can be considered as a constant fi term . however , the issue of dilaton and moduli stabilisation in the heterotic string theory is far from being resolved .",
    "it is still not clear how to derive constant fi terms from string or m - theory and only field - dependent d - terms have been identified .",
    "as we will discuss , in absence of constant fi terms , local supersymmetry requires the superpotential to be invariant under the u(1)-gauged symmetry .    in the context of theories with large extra dimensions , brane",
    "inflation occurs in a similar way as hybrid inflation within supergravity , leading to cosmic string - like objects . in string theories ,",
    "d - brane @xmath7-anti - brane annihilation leads generically to the production of lower dimensional d - branes , with d3- and d1-branes , which are d - strings , being predominant  @xcite in iib string theories . to illustrate brane",
    "inflation let us consider  @xcite a d@xmath8-@xmath9 system in iib string theory .",
    "six of the spatial dimensions are compactified on a torus , while the branes move relatively to each other in some directions . as the two branes approach",
    ", the open string modes between the branes develop a tachyon , thus an instability .",
    "brane inflation  @xcite ends by a phase transition mediated by open string tachyons .",
    "since the tachyonic vacuum has a non - trivial @xmath10 homotopy group , one concludes that there must exist stable tachyonic string solutions with @xmath11 co - dimensions ; they are stable bps ( bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ) d@xmath12-branes .",
    "since all dimensions are compact these daughter branes are seen as one - dimensional objects for a four - dimensional observer ; they are the d - strings .",
    "the d - strings ( d1-branes ) have been identified  @xcite in the low - energy supergravity with the d - term strings .",
    "the justification for this conjecture is that only d - term strings remain bps states in @xmath13 supergravity . in supergravity",
    ", f - term strings break all the supersymmetries , whereas the d - term strings preserve half of it .",
    "an interesting and successful brane inflationary model is the d3/d7 one  @xcite , which has also an effective description as a d - term inflationary model .",
    "the flat direction of the inflaton potential is associated with the shift symmetry , which protects the inflaton field from acquiring a large mass that would spoil the required flatness of the potential . in its original version",
    "this model leads to the formation of topologically stable ano bps strings . in a later developed version  @xcite of the d3/d7 model , where in terms of an effective gauge theory the model has a local u(1 ) gauge symmetry and a global su(2 ) symmetry , semi - local strings are formed .",
    "such strings can unwind without any cost of potential energy . in what follows we concentrate on inflationary models leading to the formation of topologically stable strings .",
    "strings formed at the end of an inflationary era , contribute  @xcite in the spectrum of temperature anisotropies ; their contribution is heavily constrained from cmb data .",
    "compatibility between cmb measurements and theoretical predictions constrain  @xcite the parameters space ( mass scales and couplings ) of the inflationary models .",
    "these constraints have been obtained  @xcite for d - term inflation within minimal sugra . here",
    ", we would like to investigate whether the constraints on the parameters space are a result of our choice of minimal supergravity , or whether they are a generic outcome of d - term hybrid inflation .",
    "we will therefore examine d - term inflation originated by different choices of the khler potential .",
    "the main motivation being that a minimal khler potential can be considered as a peculiar and unmotivated choice  @xcite .",
    "we base our study in a formulation of supergravity constructed from superconformal theory , since the standard formulation may be insufficient in the presence of constant fayet - iliopoulos terms  @xcite .    to be able to constrain the parameters space of the models we should know the power spectrum of a cosmic strings network and the allowed upper limit on the cosmic string contribution to the measured temperature anisotropy spectrum .",
    "the upper limit imposed on the cosmic string contribution to the cmb data depends on the numerical simulation employed in order to calculate the cosmic string power spectrum .",
    "the upper limit found in the literature  @xcite is @xmath14 or @xmath15 , depending on the simulation , with @xmath16 confidence level .",
    "there are some uncertainties in these results due to the cosmic string evolution codes they are based on was found using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the velocity - dependent one - scale model for the string evolution .",
    "this approach is certainly not the best .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath15 was found using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ; however recently the authors have corrected  @xcite a mistake in their code , which has not been taken into account in ref .",

    "note that none of the existing simulations take into account a non trivial microstructure of the cosmic strings formed : however they have been shown to be superconducting in supersymmetric abelian symmetry breaking through f- or d - terms  @xcite .",
    "we plan the rest of the paper as follows : in section ii we address hybrid d - term inflation , first within the standard formulation of supergravity , and subsequently within the effective supergravity theory built upon superconformal field theory . in the rest of the paper we focus on the second approach .",
