    "the recent experimental data have shown that the current universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite . considering",
    "the universe filled with a barotropic perfect fluid which corresponds to the dark energy component , its equation of state @xmath2 is required for cosmic acceleration , where @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the density and pressure , respectively .",
    "recently observations suggest that the equation of state lies in a narrow strip around @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath6 corresponds to a cosmological constant @xmath7 and @xmath8 is allowed . a specific form of the dark energy corresponding to the phantom field was proposed to realize the possibility of late - time acceleration with @xmath8 @xcite , while the quitom model has @xmath9 crossing @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the peculiar property of the phantom dark energy is the violation of the dominant energy condition ( dec ) , so that the energy density and curvature may grow to infinity in a finite time , which is referred to a big rip singularity @xcite .",
    "observations related to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large - scale structure ( lss ) support that the universe is very close to spatially flat geometry @xcite . at the present time our universe is dominated by dark energy with the fraction @xmath11 .",
    "the most accessible component of the universe is baryonic matter which amounts to only 4.6% .",
    "the main remaining part that is non - baryonic and non - luminous is believed to be the so - called dark matter responsible for @xmath12 .",
    "the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are considered one of the main candidates for cold dark matter which is dust - like with equation of state @xmath13 . a dark matter",
    "halo , demonstrated by its gravitational effect on a spiral galaxy s rotation curve , dominates the mass of a galaxy and can stretch up to be larger than 50 kpc from the center of a galaxy .",
    "the presence of the interaction between the dark matter and dark energy field may modify the distribution of dark matter in a galaxy . a homogeneous scalar field with",
    "negative kinetic energy has been used to model the phantom energy ( with @xmath14 ) and then to study the cosmological evolution @xcite , where the scalar field varies only with time but does not change spatially . however , for a galaxy due to the gravitational instabilities the phantom field may not be spatially homogeneous . some works related to the inhomogeneous dark energy properties have been completed @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in the static solution of the einstein equations that can describe the dark matter halo with the existence of the supermassive black hole at its center and the background of the spatially inhomogeneous phantom field .",
    "we adopt the standard assumption that the dark matter halo consists of the wimps with @xmath13 .",
    "we find that an approximate solution of the metric exists for describing this galactic halo scenario when we take the metric functions to be satisfied with @xmath15 .",
    "in general , several static and spherically symmetric exact solutions of einstein equations are obtained in terms of the parameter @xmath16 , defined by @xmath17 , for which some related works can be found in refs .",
    "we also obtain the approximate solution for the spatially inhomogeneous phantom field in a galaxy .",
    "our result indicates that the corresponding exponential potential of the phantom field is relevant to the stage of structure formation .",
    "we further study the stability of the space - time structure for the galaxy .",
    "since the phantom dark energy field can cause the quantum instability of the vacuum at high frequencies , we therefore treat it as an effective theory valid at low energy , i.e. , we add a cutoff in the momentum integral @xcite .",
    "the stringent limit for the cutoff is @xmath18 mev , which was obtained from the diffuse gamma ray background @xcite .",
    "we compute the accretion rate of the phantom particles into the black hole . since the infalling phantom particles have a total negative energy , the black hole mass diminishes in the process .",
    "on the other hand , due to the conservation of the angular momentum of the individual wimps and their tiny interaction rate , the capture cross section for dark matter particles by the supermassive black hole is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , the dark matter that we consider here is quite stable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] , we consider the pressless massive dark matter ( wimp ) directly or indirectly interacting with a phantom field which is associated with the acceleration of the universe .",
    "we solve the einstein equations with the condition @xmath15 , and the approximate solution is then obtained . as a byproduct , we will show that the exact solutions can be extended to some typical limits which are related to schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrom and schwarzschild - de sitter / anti - de sitter solutions , respectively .",
    "we calculate the distribution function of the phantom field and its potential in the region of the galactic halo . in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] , we will examine if the spatially inhomogeneous phantom field can stably survive with the existence of supermassive black hole at the center .",
    "considering the spherically symmetric space with a supermassive black hole at the center , we first semiclassically calculate the klein - gordon equation of a @xmath1-wave phantom particle that is excited from the background field .",
    "we obtain the absorption probability of the infalling phantom particle into the central black hole and further show that the absorptive cross section is approximately the area of the horizon .",
    "we show that the accretion rate of the phantom particle , which is accompanied by the decreasing rate of the black hole mass could be small enough , so that the space structure of a galaxy is stable compared with the life of the universe . in sec . [",
    "sec : stability ] , we consider a toy model of phantom particles coupled to massive dark matter , and show that both the dark matter and _ low frequency _ phantom densities can be quasi - stable for a sufficiently small coupling constant .",
    "finally we give the summary in sec .",

    "this condition is satisfied with the exact solutions , like the schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrom and de sitter / anti - de sitter solutions . for the static situation ,",
    "the einstein equations read @xmath26 where the energy - momentum tensor corresponds to the massive dark matter in the background of the phantom field , @xmath27 and a _ prime _ denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath28 . in the spherical coordinate ,",

    "we discuss the obtained exact solutions in some typical limits .",
    "in addition to the present case of the galactic dark matter interacting with the phantom field , the following ones can be satisfied with the relation @xmath44 .",

    "for the several observed cases , the rotational stars with radius @xmath55 in a spiral galaxy , where @xmath56 denotes the radius of a typical halo in a galaxy , are moving in circular orbits with _ nearly _ constant tangential speed @xmath57 which roughly ranges from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "for the region with @xmath60 , the dark matter may become very dilute .",

    "note that the form of @xmath66 is model independent but @xmath67 is not @xcite .",
    "because @xmath68 is a tiny magnitude , we can approximate the metric function in the form @xmath69    on the other hand , we focus on our solution with @xmath70 but @xmath71 , for which the galaxy has a supermassive black hole of the schwarzschild radius @xmath72 at its center and is predominated by the massive dark matter ( wimps ) in the phantom dark energy background . in the following",
    ", we will further exhibit that if we put a test particle in such a galaxy , it is possible to find a solution for which the test particle moves in circular orbit with nearly constant tangential speed consistent with the result given in eq .",

    "the wimps ( dark matter ) are quite stable owing to the conservation of the angular momentum of the individual particles and the tiny interaction among them , so that the capture cross section for dark matter particles by the supermassive black hole is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , to study the stability of the space - time structure for the galaxy , we compute the accretion rate of the excited phantom particles into the black hole . if the non - relativistic dark matter can be long lived enough compared with the age of the universe , in the following , we will estimate the absorption probability , absorption cross section , and the accretion rate of the phantom excitation wave into the black hole . at low energies ,",
