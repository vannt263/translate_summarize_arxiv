    "high energy physics experiments in recent years have confirmed the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) , a renormalizable , chiral gauge theory based on the group @xmath3 . in particular ,",
    "the low energy dynamics of fermions and gauge bosons of the theory have been tested with great accuracy .",
    "the origin of masses of these fundamental particles , however , remains a mystery . in the sm ,",
    "masses arise through the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar field doublet , which spontaneously breaks the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry @xmath4 . a physical , neutral scalar field , the so called higgs field , appears in the spectrum .",
    "information on the mass of this scalar particle may be obtained through the quantum corrections that it induces to the masses and couplings of the ew gauge bosons .",
    "consistency of the sm predictions with experimental observations is improved for small values of the higgs mass , @xmath5 , close to the current experimental bound , @xmath6  gev  @xcite .",
    "there are several aspects of the mechanism of the origin of mass that demand explanation . on one hand ,",
    "the scale of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is governed by the size of the scalar mass parameter appearing in the higgs field effective potential , and is much smaller than the planck scale , the only known mass scale in nature , besides the dynamical generated qcd scale @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , this scale is associated with a negative value of the squared higgs mass .",
    "there is , however , no dynamical explanation for the origin of the higgs effective potential , or for the associated breakdown of the ew symmetry . finally , the hierarchy of the fermion masses of the different generations remains unexplained .",
    "warped extra dimensions provide a theoretically attractive framework for the solution of the hierarchy problem of the sm .",
    "for one extra spatial dimension as in rs1  @xcite , the curvature @xmath8 in the extra dimension induces a warp factor on the four dimensional metric , which depends on the position in the extra dimension .",
    "the coordinate point , @xmath9 , is associated with a trivial scale factor , leading to natural scales of the order of the planck scale .",
    "the other boundary in the compact dimension , @xmath10 , is associated with natural scales that are smaller by an exponential factor @xmath11 . for natural values of @xmath8 of the order of the planck scale and values of @xmath12 , a higgs field , located at @xmath13",
    "will naturally acquire a vev of the order of the weak scale .",
    "neither the origin of the breakdown of the ew symmetry , nor the hierarchy of fermion masses , however , are explained by these considerations .",
    "the propagation of fermions and gauge fields in the extra dimension enables a possible explanation for the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "indeed , chirality of the fermion zero modes is ensured by imposing an orbifold symmetry @xmath14 .",
    "even fields under this orbifold symmetry acquire zero modes whose masses arise from the vev of the higgs field . for fermion fields , the equations of motion demand that fields of opposite chirality to those having zero modes are odd under the orbifold symmetry and therefore have no zero modes .",
    "finally , localization in the fifth dimension is controlled by a mass parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the variation of @xmath15 by factors of order one induces exponential variations in the overlap of the fermion wave functions with the higgs field wave function and therefore on the induced masses for the fermions  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "third generation left handed chiral quark fields which couple strongly to the higgs are associated with a mass parameter @xmath16 , and therefore their zero - modes are localized towards the so - called infra - red ( ir ) brane at @xmath10 . on the contrary , first and second generation left handed chiral fermions have mass parameters @xmath17 and the zero modes are localized towards the so - called ultraviolet ( uv ) brane at @xmath9 .",
    "gauge - higgs unification models  @xcite provide a solution to the last mysterious aspect of the sm , while leading to a dynamical origin for the higgs field effective potential .",
    "the gauge symmetry of the sm is extended in the bulk and broken at the boundaries .",
    "the higgs is associated with the fifth component of gauge fields in the direction of the broken gauge symmetry .",
    "the gauge bosons associated with the broken symmetry are odd under the orbifold symmetry and the fifth component is guaranteed to be even , leading to the presence of massless scalar fields in the theory , with no potential at tree - level .",
    "the coleman - weinberg higgs potential is then determined by quantum corrections .",
    "for certain values of the fermion mass parameters , this effective potential leads to the higgs field acquiring a non - zero vev and to the proper generation of gauge boson and fermion masses",
    ".    warped extra dimensions have a rich spectrum of four dimensional kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations .",
    "in particular , after ew symmetry breaking , the kk modes of the weak gauge fields mix with the would - be zero modes , inducing important modifications to the masses and couplings of gauge fields at tree - level .",
    "such large modifications would render the theory inconsistent for values of the gauge field s masses at the reach of the lhc  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was realized that these large corrections may be prevented by extending the weak gauge symmetry in the bulk of the extra dimension to incorporate the custodial symmetry : @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a left - right parity symmetry , @xmath19 is necessary to prevent large corrections to the bottom - quark couplings  @xcite .",
    "a gauge extension of the ew sector of the model to @xmath20 provides a framework in which gauge - higgs unification and custodial symmetry are possible .",
    "the higgs potential is fully calculable at one - loop level and a prediction for the higgs boson mass may be obtained .",
    "consistency of the theory at the quantum level , however , demands that the possible large corrections to precision electroweak parameters induced by the fermions of the theory be computed .",
    "it was recently shown that complete consistency may be obtained for certain values of the mass parameters associated with the fermions of the third generation  @xcite , provided the higgs remains light , as is expected in gauge - higgs unification models .    in this work ,",
    "we compute the dynamically generated higgs potential in models similar to the ones previously analyzed in refs .",
    "the higgs potential is calculated by means of a generalization of the framework discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the specifics of our model are complementary to the one discussed in ref .",
    "we find that a consistent breakdown of the ew symmetry , with a dynamical generation of masses of the gauge bosons and the third generation quarks may only be obtained for certain values of the fermion mass bulk parameters .",
    "interestingly enough , these mass parameters are the same as those demanded by consistency with experimental observations at the quantum level  @xcite . moreover , the higgs boson is predicted to be light , with mass @xmath21 in the range to be probed by the tevatron and the lhc in the near future .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our 5-dimensional ( 5d ) model and derive the gauge boson spectral functions .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the @xmath22 gauge boson form factor at low energy , defining its coupling to the higgs field . in section 3",
    "we derive the fermion spectral functions , necessary to compute the loop - induced higgs effective potential and the fermion mass spectrum .",
    "we also compute the top quark form factor at low energy and the associated yukawa coupling .",
    "section 4 deals with the explicit computation of the effective potential . in section 5",
    "we present the numerical analysis of the effective potential for the higgs and the kk spectrum of the theory .",

    "we are interested in a 5d gauge theory with gauge group @xmath0 .",

    "the explicit form of the generators  @xcite are given in appendix a.    our fermions @xmath31 also live in the bulk , and they transform under a representation @xmath32 of @xmath29 .",
    "however , for the moment , we concentrate only on the gauge content of our model .",
    "the phenomenologically required fermionic content will be discussed in detail in section 3 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath65 and @xmath66 also have zero modes which will become massive as soon as the @xmath63 s develop a vev , leading ultimately to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "part of our work consists of obtaining the mass spectrum of the theory in the presence of the vev of @xmath63 .",
    "the higgs forms a bidoublet under @xmath67 , whose doublet component under @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 , with charge 0 under the @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath67 symmetry in principle implies that we can choose any one of the components to be the only non - zero one acquiring a vev .",

    "we will discuss the physical implications of the above limiting case in section 5 .",
    "the sm fermions are embedded in full representations of the bulk gauge group .",

    ", the choice @xmath124 has to be enforced  @xcite .",
    "an economical choice is to let the sm @xmath68 top - bottom doublet arise from a @xmath125 of @xmath0 , where the subscript refers to the @xmath70 charge . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "putting the sm @xmath68 singlet top in the same @xmath29 multiplet as the doublet , without further mixing , is disfavored since for the correct value of the top quark mass this leads to a large negative contribution to the @xmath1 parameter at one loop .",
    "hence we let the right - handed top quark arise from a second @xmath125 of @xmath0 .",
    "the right handed bottom can come from a @xmath126 that allows us to write the bottom yukawa coupling . for simplicity , and because it allows the generation of the ckm mixing matrix , we make the same choice for the first two quark generations .",
    "we therefore introduce in the quark sector three @xmath29 multiplets per generation as follows : @xmath127 @xmath128 where we show the decomposition under @xmath129 , and explicitly write the @xmath130 charges .",

    "we also show the parities on the indicated 4d chirality , where @xmath140 and @xmath141 stands for odd and even parity conditions and the first and second entries in the bracket correspond to the parities in the uv and ir branes respectively .",
    "let us stress that while odd parity is equivalent to a dirichlet boundary condition , the even parity is a linear combination of neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , that is determined via the fermion bulk equations of motion as discussed below .",
    "the boundary conditions for the opposite chirality fermion multiplet can be read off the ones above by a flip in both chirality and boundary condition , @xmath142 for example . in the absence of mixing among multiplets satisfying different boundary conditions ,",
    "the sm fermions arise as the zero - modes of the fields obeying @xmath143 boundary conditions .",
    "the remaining boundary conditions are chosen so that @xmath144 is preserved on the ir brane and so that mass mixing terms , necessary to obtain the sm fermion masses after ew symmetry breaking , can be written on the ir brane .",
    "consistency of the above parity assignments with the original orbifold @xmath145 symmetry at the ir brane will be discussed in appendix b.    as remarked above , the zero - mode fermions can acquire ew symmetry breaking masses through mixing effects .",
