    "glassy systems like spin - glasses and structural glasses below the glass transition temperatures are out of equilibrium even on the macroscopic time scale .",
    "thus , the slow dynamics of glassy systems has been a subject of continuous interest in the past years @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the anomalous dynamical behaviors are characterized by slow relaxation with long time tail and aging phenomena .    among them ,",
    "aging phenomena are the most striking dynamical behaviors as follows : two - time quantities like the correlation functions @xmath2 explicitly depend on the time elapsed after the quench @xmath3 ( the waiting time ) .",
    "if the waiting time @xmath3 is of microscopic time scale , the phenomena are merely transient on the way of relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "however , dependence on the waiting time continues even when @xmath3 is so large that one - time quantities like the magnetization are asymptotically close to time - independent values @xcite .",
    "since these phenomena mean that the dynamics is not stationary , aging is a sign showing that these systems are out of equilibrium even in macroscopic time scale , i.e. several days or weeks .",
    "these aging phenomena appear also in mean - field models of spin - glasses and do not disappear even in the infinite waiting time limit @xcite .",
    "in addition , the phase space of these models decomposes into a large number of areas separated with infinitely high free energy barriers .",
    "thus , glassy systems never reach true equilibrium and hence they are beyond the scope of thermodynamics and equilibrium statistical mechanics . hence , in order to describe thermodynamic properties of glassy systems , out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics based on a dynamical description without the assumption of ergodicity is necessary .    in investigation of such anomalous dynamical behavior of glassy systems",
    ", it was found that aging phenomena have some universal properties .",
    "theoretical analyses have suggested that there are two time regimes characterized by different dynamical properties of the two - time correlation function @xmath2 and the associated linear response function @xmath4 @xcite . in the first time regime where the time difference @xmath5 is short compared to @xmath3 , the dynamics looks stationary and the usual fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) holds . on the other hand , in the second time regime where the time difference is comparable to @xmath3 , aging phenomena occur ,",
    "i.e. @xmath2 depends on @xmath3 apart from dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , it is known that the usual fdt between the correlation @xmath2 and the response function @xmath4 should be modified in a well - defined way which involves the rescaling of the temperature @xcite .",
    "the modification was found to be valid not only for mean - field models but also for other glassy systems : spin - glass models with finite - range interactions @xcite , real spin - glasses @xcite , structural glasses @xcite and a model of phase separation @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is known for some glassy systems that the correlation function @xmath2 obeys the scaling law that it depends on @xmath6 and @xmath3 only through the value of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a system - dependent increasing function of time .",
    "aging of the correlation function and the modification of fdt imply that properties of the work done by modulating an external field in an isothermal process are completely different from properties predicted by traditional thermodynamics .",
    "in addition , the existence of the two time scales implies that thermodynamic properties must strongly depend on experimental time scales .",
    "hence , the experimental time scale dependence of the thermodynamic properties of glassy systems should be investigated to construct out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics for glassy systems .    in order to describe our results precisely , we summarize thermodynamics for an isothermal process .",
    "thermodynamics tells that when one quasistatically changes the external field the work needed for the change is independent of a path of changing the external field .",
    "in addition , the quasistatic work is equal to the change of the helmholtz free energy .",
    "when the process is not quasistatic , the work is larger than the quasistatic work .",
    "this fact is called the principle of the minimum work and is derived from the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we show that the properties described above do not hold in systems with aging .",
    "more precisely , there are two experimental time regimes characterized by different thermal properties .",
    "the first regime is a time - domain where the waiting time is much longer than the time lapse of the process .",
    "we call the time lapse the measurement time . in this regime ,",
    "the principle of the minimum work holds even though a system is out of equilibrium .",
    "more precisely , when the process is not infinitely slow , the work needed for the process is larger than the work for an infinitely slow process .",
    "in addition , value of the work for the infinitely slow process depends only on the initial state and the final state and hence it can play a role of a free energy .",
    "the second regime is the experimental time regime where the length of the measurement time are comparable to that of the waiting time . in this regime , for the single - correlation - scale systems such as @xmath0-spin spherical spin - glasses the work done in an infinitely slow operation depends on the path of changing the field even when the waiting time is infinite .",
    "this property form a striking contrast to the consequence of traditional thermodynamics described above . on the other hand , for the multi - correlation - scale systems such as sherrington - kirkpatrick model ,",
    "the work done in an infinitely slow operation is independent of the path .    in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we describe an isothermal process considered in this paper and introduce the two time regimes which characterize the experimental time scales and play a significant role in this paper . in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , we see that in the first time regime , usual thermodynamic relations hold even though the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "the only difference is that the value of the work in an infinitely slow operation @xmath9 is different from that of the change of the free energy calculated from equilibrium statistical mechanics . in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] , we present general discussion on properties of the work @xmath9 in an infinitely slow operation in the second time regime and derive conditions when @xmath9 depends on the path of changing the external field . in sec .",
    "[ section5 ] , by using the results obtained in the previous section , we show that for the single - correlation - scale systems the work in an infinitely slow operation depends on the path of changing the external field as a consequence of aging .",
    "possibility of observation of this path - dependence is also discussed .",
    "in addition , we show that for the multi - correlation - scale systems @xmath9 is not path - dependent .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ section6 ] , where implications of our results on thermodynamics of glassy systems and experimental protocols to observe quasiequilibrium properties are discussed .",
    "we describe an isothermal process to consider thermodynamic properties when aging occurs . a simple way to observe aging phenomena is through the following field cooling process ( fig .",
    "[ protocol ] ) ; the temperature of the heat bath is decreased in a small field @xmath10 to a sub - critical temperature at time 0 . after a waiting time @xmath11 the field begins to change according to a given time - dependence @xmath12 .",
    "this change of the field continues for a period of @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath11 and the measurement time @xmath13 characterize the experimental time scales .",
    "when the field is so weak that the response is linear , the work @xmath17 done on the sample during the process is given in terms of the response function @xmath4 by @xmath18 where the `` magnetization '' @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 since we are interested in long waiting time behavior , the contribution of the first term of eq .",

    "when only one correlation scale exists apart from the quasiequilibrium regime , it is known that the fdt violation factor is a constant .    in order to clarify the meaning of the time region of the aging regime ( @xmath38 ) , we give an explicit expression of aging of the correlation function as @xmath43 \\equiv   \\hat{c}(\\mu ) , \\label{explicit_expression_aging}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a system - dependent function which characterizes the aging regime and @xmath45 is the time difference @xmath5 .",
