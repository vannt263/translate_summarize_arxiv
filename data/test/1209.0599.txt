    "an active topic of dynamical systems research and an ubiquitous problem is that of _ network reconstruction _ , or inferring information about the structural and dynamical properties of a networked system @xcite .",
    "this problem is motivated by a diverse range of fields where an unknown system can be described by interconnecting subsystems acting between accessible system states . by perturbing the system and measuring these states",
    ", we seek to understand the nature and dynamics of their interactions . in general , this is an underdetermined problem and is further complicated by the fact that not all states may be available for measurement and that there may also be additional , unknown states .",
    "here we focus on noisy lti systems and seek to obtain reliable structural and dynamic information involving the measured states , whilst leaving the hidden states unrestricted .",
    "one prominent example from systems biology is the identification of gene regulatory networks , which describe the interactions between genes via biochemical mechanisms . despite the stochastic and nonlinear nature of biological systems",
    ", a linear - systems description provides an appealing and tractable option .",
    "measurements of the expression levels of individual genes are routinely available ( for example from microarray experiments ) and a number of these are taken as system states .",
    "additional hidden states are required to accurately model the effect of protein and other metabolic interactions , any process with higher than first - order dynamics and any important genes that are not selected as system states .",
    "in such applications , the assumption of full - state measurement may well lead to incorrect conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of published methods to obtain a representative linear model from full state measurements , for example @xcite using linear matrix inequalities , @xcite using a 1-norm residual and @xcite using compressive sensing .",
    "there are many other approaches to network reconstruction , for example bayesian @xcite , information theoretic @xcite and boolean @xcite , in all of which the solution is biased , most commonly towards sparsity , to compensate for the lack of information .",
    "the vice of all these methods is that if the true solution is not sparse , a sparse solution will be obtained anyway .",
    "dynamical structure functions were introduced in @xcite as a means of representing the structure and dynamics of an lti system at a resolution consistent with the number of measured states .",
    "exactly how much additional information is required to reconstruct a network from the system transfer matrix could then be quantified . in particular , without extra information , it is possible to obtain a solution that justifies any prior assumption .",
    "applications of dynamical structure functions include multi - agent systems @xcite in addition to network reconstruction @xcite , where necessary and sufficient conditions were given for exact reconstruction from the transfer matrix .    in @xcite , this approach was made robust to uncertainty in the transfer matrix by obtaining dynamical structure functions that are closest , in some sense , to the data . since the dynamical structure function is no longer unique , it is also necessary to estimate boolean network structure , that is , an unweighted directed graph of causal connections .",
    "the approach taken was to calculate the optimum dynamical structure function for every possible boolean network for a given number of measured states , @xmath0 , then use a model selection technique to select the best estimate .",
    "this approach suffers chiefly from a high computational complexity of @xmath1 , which limits its use to relatively small networks .    here",
    "we present an extension of @xcite that does not require all of the boolean network structures to be considered .",
    "in fact , we obtain a set of @xmath2 candidate structures by judiciously removing links from the fully - connected structure , with complexity in the number of structures that must be considered of @xmath3 .",
    "this set contains one structure for every level of sparsity and hence there is no prior bias towards sparser solutions .",
    "section [ dsfsec ] defines dynamical structure functions and states necessary previous results .",
    "the main result of a polynomial - time reconstruction algorithm is then presented in section [ mainsec ] .",
    "section [ aicsec ] introduces a new model selection procedure .",
    "section [ simsec ] then compares the performance of two variants of the method introduced here with that of @xcite in extensive random simulations . conclusions and an outline of future work are given in section [ concsec ] .",
    "we consider linear time - invariant ( lti ) systems of the following form : @xmath4x \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the full state vector , @xmath6 is the vector of inputs , @xmath7 is the vector of measured states , with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the @xmath10 identity matrix .",
    "that is , we assume that some of the states are directly measured and some are not .",
    "it is also possible to consider a more general form of @xmath11 matrix , as in @xcite . by eliminating the hidden states ,",
    "the dynamical structure function representation can be derived ( see @xcite ) as : @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the laplace transforms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are strictly proper transfer matrices .",
    "the hollow matrix @xmath17 is the _ internal structure _ and dictates direct causal relationships between measured states , which may occur via hidden states .",
    "the matrix @xmath18 is the _ control structure _ and similarly defines the relationships between inputs and measured states that are direct in the sense that they do not occur via any other measured states .",
    "the dynamical structure function is defined as @xmath19 and the boolean dynamical structure is defined as the boolean matrices @xmath20 , @xmath21 that have the same zero elements as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the problem of network reconstruction was cast in @xcite as a two - stage process , whereby the transfer matrix @xmath22 is first obtained from input - output data by standard system identification techniques and the dynamical structure function is then obtained from @xmath22 . here",
    "we state the main results for the second stage of this process .",
    "the dynamical structure function for a given state - space realisation is unique , and related to the transfer matrix , @xmath22 , as follows : @xmath23    whilst every @xmath19 uniquely specifies a @xmath22 , there are many such possible @xmath19s for any given @xmath22 and a dynamical structure function is said to be _ consistent _ with a given transfer matrix if , and only if , there exists a state - space realisation for which the dynamical structure function ( at the considered resolution ) satisfies .",
    "exact reconstruction is therefore possible if , and only if , there is only one @xmath19 that is consistent with @xmath22 , which requires some _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath19 .",
    "corollary [ cor1 ] defines an experimental protocol under which this condition is met .",
    "[ cor1 ] if @xmath22 is full rank and @xmath0 inputs are applied , where there are @xmath0 measured states and each input directly and uniquely affects only one measured state ( such that the matrix @xmath18 can be made diagonal ) , then @xmath19 can be recovered exactly from @xmath22 .",
    "essentially the zero elements of @xmath18 comprise sufficient knowledge to obtain @xmath19 directly from . here",
    "we assume that the conditions of the above corollary have been met , which ensures solution uniqueness when @xmath22 is known perfectly .      in practice",
    ", the transfer matrix @xmath22 will be a noisy estimate of the true transfer matrix , as considered in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the dynamical structure function obtained directly from @xmath22 may not be the best approximation of that of the true system .",
    "the noise is expressed as a perturbation on the true transfer matrix @xmath24 , for example as feedback uncertainty : @xmath25 for some transfer matrix @xmath26 . since @xmath22 will typically admit a fully - connected dynamical structure function , a strategy to estimate the boolean dynamical structure consistent with @xmath27 is required .",
    "consider the @xmath28 boolean dynamical structure function and denote @xmath29 as a dynamical structure function with this boolean structure .",
    "we can relate @xmath22 to a transfer matrix @xmath30 that is consistent with @xmath29 by @xmath31 for some transfer matrix @xmath32 . in this case , becomes : @xmath33 , which can be rearranged as : @xmath34    where @xmath35 and has the same non - diagonal boolean structure as @xmath36 . by minimising some norm of @xmath32 , with respect to @xmath37",
    ", we can obtain the @xmath37 and hence the corresponding dynamical structure function that is consistent with the closest transfer matrix to @xmath22 .",
    "the approach of @xcite was to minimise @xmath38 for every possible boolean @xmath36 ( of which there are @xmath39 since @xmath17 has @xmath40 degrees of freedom ) , then use akaikes information criterion ( aic ) @xcite to select a solution by penalising the number of nonzero elements in @xmath17 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath41 be the set of all @xmath42 that satisfy the constraints of the @xmath28 boolean @xmath42 , and minimise the frobenious norm over @xmath43 of @xmath32 as follows : @xmath44    to obtain a measure of the smallest distance @xmath45 from @xmath22 to @xmath30 .",
    "this choice of norm allows the problem to be cast as a least squares optimisation , and we denote this method @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 apply aic to the set @xmath49 .",
    "hence every boolean structure @xmath50 can be associated with a distance measure @xmath45 from and a dynamic structure @xmath37 , which is the corresponding minimising argument .",
    "the principal problem with this approach is that the computational complexity is dominated by the number of optimisations that must be performed , which can be reduced to @xmath51 by performing the optimisation of the columns of @xmath42 separately .",
    "here we propose an algorithm with polynomial complexity to estimate the dynamical structure function of @xmath27 , under the conditions of corollary [ cor1 ] .",
    "first , an iterative procedure is used to obtain a set @xmath52 , containing boolean internal structures , with one structure ( @xmath53 ) for each level of sparsity ( @xmath54 links ) .",
    "then a model selection procedure is applied to this reduced set to select a single solution .",
    "this method is denoted @xmath55 and defined as follows :    set @xmath56 as the fully - connected structure .",
    "remove one link of @xmath57 at a time to obtain a set of @xmath54 structures with @xmath58 links and calculate @xmath59 for each of these structures .",
    "set @xmath60 as the minimum-@xmath59 structure .",
    "set @xmath61 as the decoupled structure .",
    "apply a model selection procedure to the set @xmath62 .",
    "[ m3_eg ] illustrates this procedure for a @xmath63 example .",
    "the number of structures that must be considered is exactly @xmath64 . by optimising the columns of @xmath42 separately , the overall number of optimisations that must be performed is of the order @xmath3 , and since the complexity of the optimisations is also polynomial , the overall computational complexity is polynomial .",
    "the reasoning behind this approach is that the fully - connected structure is composed of all the links belonging to the true structure plus extra links that afford it a smaller @xmath65 by better modelling the noise .",
    "it is intuitive that if the level of noise is not too high , removing false links should have a smaller effect on @xmath65 than removing true links , in which case all the false links would be removed first and the true structure would be encountered .",
    "in fact , we will show that if the noise is sufficiently small ( in some norm ) then this is always the case .",

    "networks with three measured states and up to three hidden states were considered ; for each of the 64 possible boolean network structures with three measured states , 300 random , stable linear systems were generated . for each test system and for a range of noise variance from @xmath148 , three experimental estimates of @xmath128",
    "were obtained as @xmath149 , where @xmath27 is the true transfer matrix and the elements of @xmath26 were sampled from a zero - mean normal distribution .",
