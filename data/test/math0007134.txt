    "in some of the popular puzzles one is supposed to take a ring off a rope which is usually tangled with the rigid part of the puzzle .",
    "typically , such puzzles possess ingenious solutions which , if considered carefully enough , lead to interesting problems in low - dimensional topology . this phenomenon can be observed in the chinese rings which are shown below . the purpose of the puzzle is to take the loose ring off the rope .",
    "although this puzzle was for a long time a toy of the first author s children , we become seriously interested in it only after l. kauffman pointed to us some interesting mathematical aspects of it , @xcite .",
    "the history of the chinese rings can be found in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to prove that a particular solution of the chinese rings puzzle is the simplest possible , as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "if you have not thought about this puzzle before , then we suggest that you try to solve it now in order to gain an appreciation for this beautiful problem .",
    "do not be discouraged by the initial difficulty in finding a solution .",
    "indeed it is almost impossible to see all the necessary moves to be performed on the rope just by staring at the picture above .",
    "however , it is easy to see that a solution exists : imagine for a moment that the toy is made out of a flexible material and press the longer columns down so that all columns have the same length , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "figure 1 .",
    "now the solution becomes obvious !",
    "since now the rope is completely separated from the columns , it can also be untangled in the original puzzle .",
    "( actually , we need to be sure that the rope is long enough for this theoretical solution to be correct ; this can be confirmed by direct experimentation ) .",
    "the above solution shows how a simple topological idea can yield a beautiful solution to what seems to be a complicated problem .",
    "the same idea shows that the chinese rings can be presented in a somewhat more regular form :    figure 2 .",
    "note that we replaced the rope by another column with an attached ring .",
    "the problem now is to separate the loose ring ( which is assumed to be infinitely elastic ) from the solid part of the puzzle .",
    "the problem addressed in this paper is to find the simplest solution to this puzzle . as we will see soon",
    ", the solution to this problem involves an inductive argument in the number of columns .",
    "for that reason we consider a more general version of the puzzle of fig . 2 composed of an arbitrary number of columns ( all but one with an attached ring at the top ) .",
    "a precise answer to our problem requires an objective measure of the complexity of possible solutions to the puzzle . for that , imagine an arc @xmath0 drawn below with a dashed line , joining the highest column of the toy with the base .",
    "the complexity of a solution for the puzzle is the minimal number of times the elastic ring passes through the arc @xmath1 in the process of that solution .",
    "figure 3 .",
    "the minimal complexity of a solution for the chinese rings with @xmath2 columns presented at fig 3 is @xmath3    this result was conjectured by l. kauffman in @xcite , who wrote :    \" this problem in the topology of the chinese rings is a useful test case for questions that can arise in applications of knot theory to natural structures where there is always a mixture of topology and mechanical / geometrical modeling .",
    "a solution to the ring conjecture will probably involve the discovery of new techniques for understanding topology of graph embeddings in three - dimensional space .",
    "it is fun to be able to take a classical puzzle as fascinating as the chinese rings and find within it a significant topological problem .",
    "let us find the solution ! \"    * habiro moves *  there is a surprising connection between the chinese rings ( known for hundreds of years ) and a very recent theory of vassiliev invariants of knots , @xcite .",
    "k. habiro @xcite proved that two knots can not be distinguished by vassiliev invariants of order @xmath4 if and only if they are related by a sequence of moves ( called habiro moves ) presented below : +   +   +     + note that the habiro move corresponds exactly to the operation of untangling the loose ring in the version of chinese rings presented in figure 3 !",
    "the solution of the puzzle presented at the beginning of the paper requires that we first untangle the rings attached to the columns .",
    "note that as a result of this deformation of the puzzle , the arc @xmath1 will assume the form presented below .",
    "figure 4 .",
    "because we can now remove the ring by passing through the @xmath5 strands of @xmath0 the complexity of this algorithm is obviously at most @xmath3 we are going to show that this is the simplest solution to the chinese rings ; i.e. the complexity of any other solution is not less than @xmath3 for the purpose of the proof we are allowed to relax the conditions of the problem and consider it in a topological setting by allowing arbitrary deformations of the dimensions and the shape of the toy .",
    "moreover we add a point at infinity to the ambient three - space and hence consider the problem in @xmath6 these assumptions make the problem simpler and surely do not increase the complexity of the minimal solution .",
    "the body of the chinese rings with @xmath2 columns ( and with the loose ring excluded ) is a handlebody @xmath7 of genus @xmath8 embedded in the standard way into @xmath6 its complement , @xmath9 is also a handlebody of genus @xmath10 the loose ring is contractible in @xmath9 and this is the reason for which the puzzle has a solution .",
    "the arc @xmath1 assumes a complicated position in @xmath11 which can be deduced from fig .",
    "4 , see fig .",
    "5    figure 5 : complement of the puzzle @xmath12    if we remove the arc @xmath1 from @xmath11 then the loose ring , @xmath13 will no longer be contractible . recall that the complexity of a solution for the puzzle is the minimal number of passes of the ring through @xmath1 necessary for contracting the ring to a point in @xmath14 we need to show that this number is at least @xmath3 unfortunately , the position of the ring @xmath15 in @xmath16 is very complicated ; try to figure it out by yourself to see that , indeed , it is not an easy problem ! in order to avoid this problem we use three tricks : first , we take a dual approach : we fix the ring @xmath15 in @xmath11 and count the number of times the arc @xmath1 has to pass through @xmath15 in order to make @xmath15 contractible in @xmath14 second , we slightly relax the conditions of the puzzle , by assuming that @xmath1 can be deformed by an arbitrary homotopy fixing its endpoints .",
    "we assume that the endpoints of @xmath1 are at some @xmath17 therefore we consider @xmath1 as an element of @xmath18 our intention is to prove that under these relaxed conditions the complexity of the puzzle is at least @xmath3 this will surely imply that the complexity of the puzzle under original assumptions is also at least @xmath3    third , we modify the puzzle by attaching the loose ring to the base of the puzzle by an additional column , and we try to untangle @xmath1 in the modified puzzle .",
    "this seems to be a more difficult problem , but actually it is not .",
    "observe that the modified puzzle is homeomorphic to a handlebody of genus @xmath19 and that its complement is homeomorphic also to a handlebody , @xmath20 notice also that we have an embedding @xmath21 corresponding to the fact that the modified toy differs from the original only by an additional column .",
    "one can prove using van - kampen s theorem that the map @xmath22 induces an isomorphism of the fundamental groups , @xmath23 therefore the additional column does not create any new obstacle for @xmath1 !",
    "( recall that we consider the arc @xmath1 up to homotopy only . )",
    "the benefit of this trick is that the modified puzzle is much easier to solve because it does not have any loose ring .",
    "observe that the arc @xmath1 lies in @xmath24 in the pattern presented in figure 6 .",
    "figure 6 .    denote the loops going around the holes in @xmath24 in the manner presented below by @xmath25 +    figure 7 .",
    "@xmath26 is the free group on generators @xmath27 we want to determine the presentation of the element @xmath28 representing the arc @xmath1 given as in fig .",
    "6 , with say an anti - clock orientation .",
    "the presentations of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are as follows : +    figure 8 : @xmath31 and @xmath32    observe that @xmath33 can be built inductively from @xmath34 by replacing the @xmath2-th hole in @xmath24 by two holes and twisting them @xmath35 see fig 6 .",
    "this operation corresponds to replacing all @xmath36 in the presentation of @xmath34 by @xmath37 therefore @xmath38    note that each such presentation is reduced , i.e. none of the words @xmath34 has a subword of the form @xmath39 indeed , this is true for @xmath40 in general , if this is true for some @xmath2 then it is also true for @xmath41 suppose that @xmath34 is reduced .",
    "the only difference between @xmath34 and @xmath33 is that @xmath42 in @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath43 therefore , @xmath33 can not contain @xmath44 for @xmath45 hence , if @xmath33 was not reduced , it would have to have a reduction in @xmath46 s .",
    "that is , it would have to contain a subword composed of @xmath47 and its inverse .",
    "but this is impossible , since this would mean that @xmath34 contains the subword @xmath48    observe also that the number of appearances of @xmath36 in @xmath34 is @xmath3 this can also be proved by induction : @xmath49 appears once in @xmath50 and @xmath46 appears in @xmath33 twice as many times as @xmath42 in @xmath51    therefore we proved the following    [ 1.1 ] the above inductively defined presentation of @xmath28 is reduced and @xmath36 appears @xmath5 times in it .",
    "recall that we are supposed to count the minimal number of times the the ring @xmath15 has to pass through the arc @xmath1 ( in the original puzzle ) in a process of contracting it to a point .",
    "equivalently , we can calculate the number of times the arc @xmath1 has to pass through the @xmath2-th hole in @xmath24 in order to be placed inside @xmath52 ( in the situation in which the modified puzzle is considered ) .",
    "we claim that this number is at least @xmath3    whenever @xmath1 passes through the @xmath2-th hole , @xmath53 is inserted in a word representing @xmath1 or deleted from it",
    ". intuitively , since @xmath36 appears @xmath5 times in @xmath34 one has to repeat this process @xmath5 times .",
    "this may seem as an obvious fact at first , but after a closer look one can realize that it requires a proof .",
    "we will see in the next section that this problem is a special case of an interesting problem in the combinatorial group theory . in order to finish our proof",
    "we need the following fact .    [ 1.2 ]",
    "if letters @xmath54 form a reduced word @xmath55 then the minimal number of insertions or deletions of conjugates of @xmath36 into a word @xmath56 necessary for transforming @xmath57 into an element of @xmath58 is @xmath59    we will prove the above proposition in the next section .",
    "right now we complete the proof of the main theorem : recall that @xmath34 can be obtained from @xmath60 by replacing all @xmath61 appearing in @xmath60 by @xmath62 therefore , @xmath63 where , by proposition [ 1.1 ] , @xmath64 is reduced and @xmath65 by the last proposition one needs at least @xmath5 insertions of conjugates of @xmath36 into a word representing @xmath34 or deletions of such conjugates from @xmath34 in order to eliminate all appearances of @xmath42 in it .",
    "therefore the arc @xmath1 has to pass at least @xmath5 times through the @xmath2-th hole in @xmath24 in order to be placed inside @xmath66 + * final remark .",
    "* we found the complexity of the chinese rings by the study of the homotopical properties of the arc @xmath1 in a handlebody and by the use of the fundamental group .",
    "one can however consider more sophisticated puzzles , whose solutions require more advanced tools than homotopy theory .",
    "for example in order to show that the arc @xmath1 of fig .",
    "9 can not be contracted to a point ( without crossing changes ) one can use the kauffman bracket skein module of the solid torus [ p ]  an algebraic construction which generalizes the kauffman bracket polynomial , [ k ] .",
    "+    figure 9",
    "the group theoretical problem which we encountered at the end of the proof of the main theorem can be presented in a more general form as follows : consider a free group @xmath67 and a quotient map @xmath68 by an elementary operation on @xmath69 we mean an insertion of a conjugate of @xmath70 into a word representing @xmath71 observe that a deletion of @xmath72 from a word representing @xmath57 can be also realized as an insertion of @xmath73 into this word ( followed by a reduction ) and , therefore , it is also an elementary operation . observe also that two elements @xmath74 have the same image , @xmath75 if and only if they are related by a sequence of elementary operations .",
    "the above problem can be stated in a different form : any @xmath82 can be presented as @xmath83 , and we define @xmath84 to be the minimal number @xmath85 of conjugates of @xmath86 appearing in such a presentation . if @xmath87 then @xmath88          1 .",
    "@xmath92 is a `` norm '' on @xmath93 i.e. ( a ) @xmath94 iff @xmath95 in @xmath96 ( b ) @xmath97 ( c ) @xmath98 2 .",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath90 is a metric on @xmath96 which is finite on @xmath100 for any @xmath101    the proof of ( 1 ) is straightforward .",
    "also , the claim that @xmath90 is a metric on @xmath93 follows immediately form ( 1 ) and the equality @xmath102 therefore we include only the proof of that equality : if @xmath103 then @xmath104 hence we can assume that @xmath105 since @xmath106 where @xmath107 @xmath108 can by transformed into @xmath78 by @xmath85 elementary operations",
    ". therefore , @xmath109    in order to prove the opposite inequality we need the following fact : + if @xmath110 is obtained from @xmath111 by @xmath85 elementary operations then @xmath110 can be presented as @xmath112 we prove this fact by induction .",
    "the statement is true for @xmath113 suppose it is also true for @xmath114 and suppose that @xmath110 is obtained from @xmath111 by @xmath85 elementary operations . by the inductive assumption ,",
    "after @xmath114 operations we get a product of @xmath114 conjugates , @xmath115 the word @xmath110 is obtained by inserting a word @xmath116 into @xmath115 therefore @xmath117 for some @xmath118 such that @xmath119 thus @xmath120 is a product of @xmath85 conjugates .",
    "since @xmath77 is obtained from @xmath78 by @xmath121 elementary operations , @xmath122 may be obtained from @xmath123 also by @xmath121 elementary operations .",
    "therefore , by the fact proved above , @xmath122 can be presented as a product of @xmath121 conjugates of @xmath124 s .",
    "thus @xmath125    notice that problems 1 - 2 generalize the word problem in @xmath126 and that they may be very difficult to solve in general .",
