    "polyelectrolytes ( charged polymers ) are widely used in industrial applications . for example , many colloidal suspensions can be stabilized by the adsorption of polyelectrolytes . in many experiments , the total amount of polymer adsorbed on a surface ( the polymer _ surface excess _ ) is measured as a function of the bulk polymer concentration , ph and/or ionic strength of the bulk solution @xcite .",

    "we use this feature in the next section to obtain simple analytical expressions characterizing the adsorption .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining a simple picture of polyelectrolyte adsorption lies in the existence of several length scales in the problem : ( i ) the edwards correlation length @xmath54 , characterizing the concentration fluctuations of neutral polymer solutions ; ( ii ) the debye - hckel screening length @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the bjerrum length equal to about 7@xmath57   for aqueous solutions at room temperature .",

    "the free energy can be now expressed in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath60 while the exact form of @xmath59 affects only the numerical prefactors .    in principle",

    "the second term accounts for the electrostatic attraction of the polymers to the charged surface .",
    "the third term represents the coulomb repulsion between adsorbed monomers .",
    "indeed , the interaction between two layers with surface charge densities @xmath68 and @xmath69 is proportional to the distance @xmath70 yielding the @xmath71 dependence .",

    "polyelectrolytes the electrostatic interactions are much stronger than the excluded volume ones . neglecting the latter interactions and minimizing the free energy with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath60 gives : @xmath84 and @xmath85 the above expressions are valid as long as ( i ) @xmath65 and ( ii ) the excluded volume term in eq .",

    "@xmath89@xmath57   this limits the salt concentration to @xmath90 0.4 m. the latter condition on the magnitude of the excluded volume term can be shown to be equivalent to @xmath91 .",

    "one of the important features is the decrease in @xmath0 with increasing charge fraction @xmath2 .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : the monomer ",
    "monomer coulomb repulsion scales as @xmath97 , and dominates over the adsorption energy scaling only as @xmath98 .",
    "the opposite case occurs when @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the electrostatic interactions are short ranged with a cut - off @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the free energy then reads : @xmath99 note that @xmath61 enters in the 2nd and 3rd terms .",

    "another interesting observation which can be deduced from eq .",
    "[ scalinggamma2 ] is that @xmath0 is only a function of @xmath107 . indeed , as can be seen in fig .",

    "@xcite have studied the adsorption of heteropolymers made of neutral ( acrylamide ) and cationic monomers ( derived from chloride acrylate ) .",
    "the fractional charge was fixed during the polymerization process and varied from @xmath118 to 1 . since the salt amount in their experiment was quite low : @xmath119 mm corresponding to @xmath120@xmath57 , their experimental range satisfies the low  salt conditions .",
    "indeed , the measured @xmath0 ( table ii in ref .",
    "@xcite ) exhibits a @xmath5 dependence as in eq .",
    "[ scalinggamma1 ] .",
    "shubin and linse @xcite adsorbed another cationic derivative of poly(acrylamide ) on silica .",
    "the fractional charge was fixed at a low value ( @xmath121 ) , while the salt concentration varied from @xmath51 mm to @xmath122 m .",
    "ellipsometry was used to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the adsorbed layer as function of the salt concentration .",
    "this low charge fraction belongs to the left side ( low @xmath2 ) of fig .",
    "the experimental behavior is similar to our predictions as shown in fig .  5 for weak polyelectrolytes .",
    "at low electrolyte concentration ( @xmath123 mm ) , the adsorbed amount is essentially constant and decreases at higher salt concentration ( sr i regime of fig .",
    "similar behavior was obtained both by numerical calculations using the multi  stern layer model @xcite , and in other adsorption experiments of cationic potato starch @xcite .",
    "kawaguchi et al .",
    "@xcite measured the adsorption of a highly charged polyelectrolyte ( pvpp ) on silica surfaces . due to the high ionic strength",

    "@xcite also performed adsorption experiments with highly charged ( @xmath125 ) hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide ) .",
    "the adsorbed amount @xmath0 and the width of the adsorbed layer @xmath1 were found to increase upon addition of salt .",
    "qualitatively , this agrees with our prediction in the sr ii regime .",

    "peyser and ullman @xcite studied the adsorption of pvp on a glass surface as function of the charge fraction for three different salt concentrations .",
    "the system belongs to the right side ( @xmath128 ) of fig .  5 between the low  salt and sr ii regimes .",
    "as expected @xmath0 increases with @xmath3 and decreases with @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to fit the data to a simple scaling law of the form @xmath129 .",
    "our scaling results do not fit very well these experiments which lie in the intermediate regime , between the low  salt and sr ii regimes .    in experiments on annealed polyelectrolytes @xcite ,",
    "the polymer charge can be tuned by the ph of the solution ( eq .  [ phpk ] ) .",
    "the behavior then shifts continuously from the sr i to the sr ii regimes .",
    "for example , blaakmeer et al .",
    "@xcite used polyacrylic acid which is neutral ( no dissociation ) at low ph but becomes negatively charged ( strong dissociation ) at higher ph . as predicted by eq .",
    "[ scalinggamma2 ] ( see also fig .  4b ) , a non - monotonous dependence of @xmath0 on the ph was observed , with a maximum below the pk@xmath130 .",
    "this effect had been already verified by numerical calculations based on the multi  stern layer model @xcite .",
    "a similar maximum in @xmath0 was also observed in adsorption experiments of proteins @xcite and diblock copolymers with varying ratios between the charged and neutral blocks @xcite and may be interpreted using similar considerations .",
    "in this work we use simple arguments to derive scaling laws describing the adsorption of polyelectrolytes on a single charged surface held at a constant potential .",
    "we obtain expressions for the amount of adsorbed polymer @xmath0 and the width @xmath1 of the adsorbed layer , as a function of the fractional charge @xmath2 and the salt concentration @xmath3 . in the low  salt regime",
    "a @xmath5 dependence of @xmath0 is found .",
    "it is supported by our numerical solutions of the profile equations [ pbs ] , [ scfs ] and is in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "this behavior is due to strong coulomb repulsion between adsorbed monomers in the absence of salt .",
    "as @xmath2 decreases , the adsorbed amount increases until the electrostatic attraction becomes weaker than the excluded volume repulsion , at which point , @xmath0 starts to decrease rapidly . at high salt concentrations",
    "we obtain two limiting behaviors : ( i ) for weak polyelectrolytes , @xmath131 , the adsorbed amount increases with the fractional charge and decreases with the salt concentration , @xmath132 , due to the monomer  surface electrostatic attraction .",
    "( ii ) for strong polyelectrolytes , @xmath114 , the adsorbed amount decreases with the fractional charge and increases with the salt concentration , @xmath133 , due to the dominance of the monomer  monomer electrostatic repulsion . between these two regimes",
    "we find that the adsorbed amount reaches a maximum in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "the scaling approach can serve as a starting point for further investigations .",
    "special attention should be directed to the crossover regime where @xmath1 and @xmath61 are of comparable size . at present , it is not clear whether the intermediate regime represents simply a crossover between regimes or is a scaling regime on its own .",
    "another important question addresses the relative importance of attractive versus repulsive forces between two charged surfaces in presence of a polyelectrolyte solution .",
