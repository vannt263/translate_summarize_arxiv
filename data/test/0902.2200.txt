    "there is a great interest in nanoscopic systems , either because of its potential application in nanodevices or as ideal systems to test theories for non - trivial physical problems . in particular , the kondo effect is present in many of these systems , like magnetic impurities on clean noble metal surfaces or quantum corrals @xcite , small clusters on these surfaces @xcite and systems of quantum dots @xcite . in particular , the unitary limit , which consists in the maximum possible conductance through a quantum dot has been reached experimentally @xcite .",

    "the calculation of transport through a mesoscopic ring in which both interference effects and interactions leading to the kondo effect are present is not trivial .",
    "an example of this is a recent debate about the role of interactions in dephasing @xcite . even knowing the exact eigenstates of the ring , there is no simple procedure to calculate the conductance . when the coupling @xmath0 of the ring to the conducting leads is small , using perturbation theory up to second order in @xmath0 , an expression has been derived , which is also exact for any @xmath0 in the non - interacting limit , the jagla - balseiro formula @xcite .",

    "for a ring described by the ionic hubbard model , it has been shown that the conductance through the system is related to the quasiparticle weight @xcite .",
    "the physics of the kondo regime was recovered by mapping the model into an impurity anderson model , but at the cost of losing interference effects .",
    "one of the branches of nanophysics with particular recent interest is spintronics , which consists in developing means of creating and controlling spin polarized currents in nanoscale systems @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient for this purposes is the rashba spin - orbit coupling @xmath5 which is present in quantum wells .",
    "recent experiments in semiconductor mesoscopic rings have shown that the conductance oscillates not only as a function of the applied magnetic field ( aharonov - bohm effect ) but also as a function of the applied electric field @xmath6 perpendicular to the plane of the ring ( aharonov - casher effect ) @xcite . in this effect ,",

    "the main features of the experiment can be understood in a one - electron picture @xcite . however , this picture is inadequate in the presence of strong correlations . in particular ,",
    "the kondo effect can not be described .",
    "the aim of the present work is two - fold : first , to provide a method to calculate the conductance through a ring that is able to capture at the same time the kondo physics and interference effects ; second , to apply the formalism to calculate the conductance through a ring under the action of both , magnetic and electric fields together with rashba spin - orbit coupling @xmath7 . in the second task we stumbled with the difficulty of finding the form of the hubbard model in the presence of @xmath7 , which adequately describes the periodicity with the applied electric field seen in the experiments .",
    "we solved this problem using a non - abelian gauge transformation in the continuum version of the model , which translates the effect of @xmath7 to a change in the boundary conditions .",
    "the main physical result is that the combination of both kondo effect and spin - orbit coupling leads to a strongly spin dependent conductivity that might be used for spin filtering purposes .",

    "to calculate the conductance through an interacting subsystem , it is necessary to obtain some green functions of the whole system , which includes the interacting part both leads @xcite .",
    "an example of an interferometer assembled experimentally with one quantum dot is given in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath8    @xmath9 describes the interacting subsystem ( in the case described below , a hubbard ring with spin - orbit coupling ) .",

    "we label the sites in this region so that site 0 is coupled to the left lead and site 1 to the right one .",
    "the prime in @xmath15 reminds us that the hamiltonian of the subsystem is written in a particular gauge , as described in the next section . note that the phases of all @xmath16 operators can be chosen so that @xmath17 and @xmath0 are real , regardless of the above mentioned gauge .",
    "the zeeman term is neglected here . to reduce the number of parameters",
    ", we have assumed identical left and right leads and the same coupling between any of them and the interacting subsystem .",
    "since @xmath9 describes a finite system , it can be diagonalized exactly .",
    "our general approach to calculate the conductance amounts to a truncation of the hilbert space of @xmath9 , retaining only two neighboring charge configurations , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 particles .",
    "it can be shown that this procedure is valid for small enough @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "however , interference effects , for example the vanishing of the conductance through the ring for certain values of the flux @xcite is a consequence of an _ orbital _ degeneracy of levels for that flux and more states than one kramers doublet should be included in @xmath27 , as we report in section 4 .    in general ,",

    "we have derived an extension of the hubbard model that includes spin - orbit interaction , absorbing it in opposite aharonov - casher phases for spin up and down in an adequately chosen quantization axis , defined by a non - abelian gauge transformation . for a non - interacting system",
