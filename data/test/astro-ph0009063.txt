    "our first classification scheme separates galaxies into emission line and non - emission line objects .",
    "this classification relates well to the early / late morphological type classification ( e.g. biviano et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , in some cases early type galaxies , like sos , can exhibit emission lines features in their spectra . in any case ,",
    "biviano et al . (",
    "1997 ) have shown that less than 4@xmath14 of elliptical or so cluster galaxies have emission lines .",
    "this implies that our spectroscopically  determined `` late type galaxies '' ( see fig .",
    "4 ) are probably free from significant contamination by early type objects .",
    "in other cases , some late type galaxy spectra do not have strong emission lines , however .",
    "moreover , we used blocking filters to obtain the spectra of the cop galaxies ( see adami et al .",
    "2000a ) which significantly reduced the available spectral range .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that we missed emission line features due to this reduced spectral coverage .",
    "our `` early type galaxies '' bin may , therefore , be contaminated by late type objects .",
    "the other classification scheme we used was based on the three - color information ( v , r and i ) we had for most of the galaxies in the sample ( 56 out of 74 ) . once the redshift was known , the spectral energy distribution was constrained and a rough classification between different spectral types was assigned .",
    "we used the frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) colors to classify our galaxies into 4 spectral types .",
    "table 3 gives the v@xmath23i , v@xmath23r and r@xmath23i colors from frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) for the 4 different morphological types we used and for the 4 redshifts of our composite clusters .",
    "we matched the 3 colors of each object with this table .",
    "first , we transformed the v@xmath24i@xmath16 , v@xmath24r@xmath25 and r@xmath26i@xmath16 into the standard johnson system used in frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) .",
    "as in postman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and adami et al ( 2000a ) we applied the following relations for the color transformations :    v@xmath23i = 0.41 + 0.855(v@xmath24i@xmath16)+ 0.012(v@xmath24i@xmath16)@xmath17 ,    v@xmath23r = @xmath230.02+(v@xmath24r@xmath25)@xmath270.056(v@xmath24i@xmath16)+ 0.012(v@xmath24i@xmath16)@xmath17 , and    r@xmath23i = 0.43+(r@xmath26i@xmath16)@xmath230.089(v@xmath24i@xmath16 ) .",
    "each color will , in principle , correspond to a single color - type , but this did not always happen .",
    "we therefore developed a method of using the colors to uniquely determine the galaxy color - type .",
    "first , if all 3 independent color - type determinations derived by the colors did yield the same result , we selected that color - type .",
    "this occurred for 24@xmath14 of the sample .",
    "second , if 2 color - types among the 3 were identical , and if the third color - type was close to these two ( for example , i m is close to scd ) , we selected the two identical color - types ( 50@xmath14 of the sample ) .",
    "third , if 2 color - types among the 3 were identical , but if the third color - type was not close to these two ones ( for example , i m is not close to sbc ) we again selected the two identical color - types ( 5@xmath14 of the sample ) .",
    "fourth , if the 3 color - types were different and close ( for example , e , sbc and scd ) , we selected the mean color - type ( 14@xmath14 of the sample ) . finally , if the 3 color - types were different but not close ( for example , e , sbc and i m ) , we selected the color - type providing the lowest difference with the values of table 3 ( 7@xmath14 of the sample ) .",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath28 bin of frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) was a mix of elliptical and so galaxies , the @xmath29 bin was a mix of sa , sb and sc galaxies , the @xmath30 bin was a mix of sd and sm galaxies and the @xmath31 bin contained only irregular galaxies .",
    "this classification technique is similar to the one used in the cnoc survey ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) , except that we used three colors instead of two , and we assigned a morphological type ( called color - type hereafter ) using the frei @xmath3 gunn ( 1994 ) templates .",
    "the classification estimates with the largest uncertainties are for the last two cases and they constitute only 21@xmath14 of the sample .",
    "the main uncertainties in the color classification scheme came from the uncertainties in the magnitudes .",
    "possible dust obscuration found , for example , in cl0039 + 4713 ( z=0.41 : smail et al .",
    "1999 ) can lead to misclassifications , but we ignored this effect .",
    "we also compare the predicted types of our two classification schemes .",
    "overall , emission line galaxies should be mostly late type galaxies and absorption line galaxies should be mostly early type galaxies .",
    "the direct comparison shows that , on one hand , 100@xmath14 of the emission line galaxies of our sample have a color - type later than sbc ( sbc : 33@xmath14 , scd:42@xmath14 , i m : 25@xmath14 ) .",
    "on the other hand , 14@xmath14 of the non - emission line galaxies have a color - type later than scd ( e : 50@xmath14 , sbc : 36@xmath14 , scd:0@xmath14 , i m : 14@xmath14 ) .",
    "these percentages are well within our expectations ( see above ) and these results give strength to our classification schemes .",
    "however , we must consider this color classification scheme ( red galaxies : early types , blue galaxies : late types ) only as an @xmath32 of the true morphological type .",
    "the spectral assignment is clearly not as reliable as the @xmath33 morphological types obtained , for example , via hst observations by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) or lubin et al .",
    "the morphology and the stellar content of a galaxy can be affected differently by various astrophysical processes and consequently the two tentative classifications by colors or spectral features described in this section must be considered only as an approximation of the morphological types . however , in order to compare our distant cluster with their local counterparts ( enacs ) we needed to establish such a relation between spectral and morphological classifications .      in order to relate the cnoc composite clusters with the rest of our sample ( significantly increasing the number of galaxies )",
    ", we decided to split the cnoc spectral classification into two bins that could be related to our previous classification .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these subsamples as early and late type cnoc galaxies    we assigned the cnoc spectral types 1 , 2 ( elliptical galaxies ) and 3 ( e+a galaxies ) to the early type class .",
    "these are mainly elliptical galaxies because the cnoc type 3 galaxies represent less than 2.5@xmath14 of the sample .",
    "the cnoc types 4 and 5 are assumed to be late type galaxies . in order to compare with the enacs data , we associated this late type bin to the bin sc+sd+sm+irr of adami et al .",
    "as shown in adami et al . ( 1998 ) , there exists both a magnitude and a morphological segregation of galaxies in nearby clusters that agrees with simple dynamical models of cluster formation and evolution .",
    "the bright galaxies have a lower velocity dispersion compared to the fainter ones .",
    "this variation is expected from energy equipartition in clusters .",
    "the elliptical galaxies have a lower velocity dispersion compared to the later morphological types in nearby clusters .",
    "the ratio of these dispersions between the elliptical and the late type spiral galaxies is consistent with a model where the late type spirals are currently falling into the cluster .",
    "we now compare the results of adami et al .",

    "we plot in figures 1 , 2 and 3 the variation of the normalized velocity dispersions versus the absolute magnitude for the 3 distant composite clusters .",

    "1998 ) , our comparison study .",
    "if we assume that the percentage of late type galaxies increases from the inner part to the outer parts of the clusters ( e.g. adami et al .",

    "( 1998 ) and postman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in order to check this point ,",

    "we found in this region , 65@xmath14 red galaxies , 18@xmath14 intermediate galaxies and 17@xmath14 very blue galaxies .",
    "these percentages are in agreement with the work of lubin et al .",
    "the choice of metric aperture is therefore important , and it could be an explanation for why the longer look  back time studies of lubin and postman did not yield evidence for evolution",
    ". it may be that at longer look back times ( z@xmath00.8 ) other effects could lead to a relatively low blue galaxy fraction ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the entire evolutionary process is complicated , however , and it probably also relates to the dynamical state of the clusters as well as its redshift .",
    "for example , wang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed a correlation between cluster ellipticity and blue galaxy fraction , and metevier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that there exist nearby clusters that have bi - modal galaxy or x - ray distributions which have relatively high blue fractions and are yet at low ( @xmath49 ) redshifts .",
    "when we compared the dynamical and the cluster content evolution of our composite clusters between z@xmath00.4 and z@xmath00.48 , the situation is consistent : we both found `` younger '' clusters and a `` younger '' population at higher redshift .",
    "however , the composite clusters from z@xmath00.07 to z@xmath00.4 give the following puzzle : how did the cluster contents evolve in morphological type , while the clusters have not apparently evolved in terms of their dynamical state ?",
    "we now examine this point .",
    "the answer is , it is possible to have the bright galaxies virialize before changing morphological type .",
    "this would explain why our composite nearby and distant clusters have the same distribution of galaxies versus magnitude , but they do not have the same ratio of late to early type galaxies .",
    "we can see this by assuming that galaxies virialize via dynamical friction , which takes 0.1 gyrs for the brightest galaxies for example in our @xmath50 sample and 1 to 1.5 gyrs for the faintest galaxies ( sarazin , 1986 ) .",
    "yet , if galaxy - galaxy interactions cause the galaxies to change morphological type , the galaxies take about 1 gyr to change ( crossing time ) , and clearly the more massive ( brighter ) galaxies can reach a `` relaxed state '' before changing morphological type . without additional assumptions",
    ", however , this scenario runs into a difficulty ; namely , the time between @xmath51 and @xmath50 is about 4 gyrs , and the nearby clusters should have virialized such that the dynamical state of the nearby and distant clusters should not be the same .",
    "a way to deal with this is to assume that clusters are ( not surprisingly ) continually evolving ( e.g. ulmer et al 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "this scenario is clearly not new and has been investigated in details by authors such as oemler ( 1974 ) , melnick @xmath3 sargent ( 1977 ) , dressler ( 1980 ) or whitmore @xmath3 gilmore ( 1991 ) .",
    "however , here , we have a unique case to check this scenario with homogeneously analyzed clusters from z@xmath00 to z@xmath00.5 .",
    "clusters are evolving being fed continuously by the in - fall of field galaxies and groups ( or other clusters ) .",
    "the majority of the infalling field galaxies are late - type . the most recent episode of in - fall could have been such that the relative low mass late type galaxies in the outer regions have been able to evolve into early type galaxies ( @xmath01 gyr ) while yet not virializing ( @xmath01.5 gyr ) .",
    "this leads to the nearby clusters having higher velocity dispersions in their outer portions while , at the same time , having relatively low fractions of late - type galaxies .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with finding a correlation with dynamical age and blue fraction ( wang et al .",
    "it is not completely clear how this hypothesis relates to finding nearby clusters which have bi - modal distributions and appear to have relatively large blue fraction ( metevier et al .",
    "2000 ) . in a high matter density universe",
    ", however , the cluster formation occurs at late epochs ( close to the present time ) and a high density universe could then leads to the production of dynamically young structures until relatively recent epochs .    if we assume the general picture of cluster evolution and formation , we can extrapolate this scenario back in time to place a lower limit on when clusters formed and also suggest what clusters should look like in terms of morphology and dynamical state if we are able to extend studies to redshifts up to @xmath52 . this is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "an interesting question to ask is : when did all these clusters form ?",
    "this epoch depends strongly of the cosmological model ( e.g. oukbir @xmath3 blanchard 1992 and 1997 ) . in a high @xmath53 universe ,",
    "the clusters form later than in a low @xmath53 universe , but they evolve faster . to adress this question , we can use the composite clusters of our sample from z@xmath00.07 to z@xmath00.4 .",
    "these are already , at least partially , relaxed .",
    "we can then assume that the `` formation '' process has occurred at an epoch earlier than z@xmath00.4 .",
    "the clusters of the z@xmath00.48 sample have younger dynamical characteristics and we can assume that they are close to the @xmath54 of their `` first formation '' process , which probably occured around z@xmath00.5 .",
    "now we have to estimate the time needed to form such a cluster to estimate the epoch of the @xmath55 of the formation process .    the surface covered by the clusters of our samples",
    "is a circle of about @xmath01h@xmath7 mpc radius .",
    "the minimal time to form such a cluster is then less than 1 gyear in a violent relaxation process ( 1 crossing time , see sarazin 1986 ) .",
    "adding 1 gyear to z@xmath00.5 gives the epoch of the beginning of the cluster formation , i.e. in a q@xmath8=0 universe @xmath07.2 gyears ( not significantly different from when we use low values of q@xmath8 but different from 0 ) .",
    "we then conclude that the cluster formation process for the clusters of our sample began at z@xmath340.8 .",
    "consistent with this hypothesis are the recent detections of clusters of galaxies at z@xmath00.8 ( in addition to the two quoted in section 4.1 : ms1054 - 03 and 1604 + 4304 ) .",

    "our derived lower limit to the time of cluster formation epoch is consistent with work on finding massive clusters at z = 0.8 or higher .",

    "we must , therefore , conclude ( at the level of statistics we have here ) that it is primarily the outer regions of the clusters that contribute the relatively large blue fractions of distant clusters . although the nearby clusters should have virialized completely , the outer portions of these clusters are not virialized and yet are dominated by red galaxies .",
    "continuous in - fall of relatively numerous , low mass galaxies such that the galaxies have evolved into early type galaxies is just consistent with the time scales involved ( 1gy for relaxation for low mass or faint galaxies and 1.5 gy for virialization ) .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present an analysis of the dynamics and segregation of galaxies in rich clusters from z@xmath00.32 to z@xmath00.48 taken from the cfht optical pdcs ( cop ) survey and from the cnoc survey ( carlberg et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results from the cop survey are based upon the recent observational work of adami et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2000a ) and holden et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2000 ) and use new spectroscopic and photometric data on six clusters selected from the palomar distant cluster survey ( pdcs ; postman et al . 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the cop and cnoc samples to the eso nearby abell cluster survey ( enacs : z@xmath00.07 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our sample shows that the @xmath1 clusters have the same velocity dispersion versus magnitude , morphological type and radius relationships as nearby ( @xmath2 ) abell clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the z@xmath00.48 clusters exhibit , however , departures from these relations . furthermore , there appears to be a higher fraction of late  type ( or bluer , e.g. butcher and oemler , 1984 ) galaxies in the distant clusters compared to the nearby ones .    </S>",
    "<S> the classical scenario in which massive galaxies virialize before they evolve from late into early type explain our observations . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scenario , the clusters of our sample began to form before a redshift of approximately 0.8 and the late  type galaxy population had a continuous infall into the clusters .     </S>",
    "<S> galaxies : clusters : general  cosmology : observations  cosmology : large scale structure of universe </S>"
