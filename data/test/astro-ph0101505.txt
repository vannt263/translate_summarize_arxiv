    "short transient event phenomena like x - ray bursts are known since 1975 ( grindlay et al . 1976 , belian et al . 1976 ) , with a total of @xmath0 burst sources revealed within about one year since the initial discovery .",
    "accretion onto the surface of a weakly magnetized neutron star ( ns ) can give rise to x - ray bursts via unstable nuclear burning , if the system is filled through roche - lobe overflow at transfer rates much lower than the eddington limit of @xmath1  @xmath2/year ( van paradijs et al.,1988 ) .",
    "wind - fed systems can not be x - ray burst sources whereas most persistent x - ray bursters are identified with low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) , being mostly atoll sources .",
    "relevant source properties can be derived from combined burst and persistent emission study ( distance , radius , composition of nuclear fuel etc .",
    ", see lewin et al .",
    "1995 for review ) . in this respect ,",
    "very important are the so - called _ super - eddington _ bursts , in which expansion of the blackbody ( bb ) emitting photosphere occurs up to radii of several tenths of kilometers ( lewin et al .",
    "1993 ) , due to the emission level reaching the eddington luminosity .",
    "the profiles from these bursts tend to flatten at energies above @xmath3  kev and often show a double - peaked structure , each peak being associated with the expansion and contraction phases ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this allows to estimate distances via the determination of the burst peak fluxes , assumed to be at a level of @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 which is the eddington luminosity of a standard 1.4  @xmath2  ns .",
    "recently , x - ray burst research went to a new exciting phase following the the discovery of high time resolution features like khz nearly coherent oscillations in the burst time profiles ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) , present during both the rising and cooling phases and then probably associated to the ns spin period ( strohmayer & markwardt , 1999 ) .",
    "these studies can also give important insight in the understanding of the geometry , structure and composition of the burning layers ( muno et al .",
    ", 2000 ) .    since 1992 , the detection by granat / sigma of hard x - ray emission from a few bursters , namely ks1731 - 260 , gx354 + 0 and 1e1724 - 3045 ( barret & vedrenne 1994 ) and subsequently other batse observations ( barret et al . 1996 ) have established x - ray bursters as a new important class of low luminosity hard x - ray emitters .",
    "a few years after these early 90 observations , the population of x - ray bursters had a substantial increase by means of the _ bepposax _ observation campaigns performed since 1996 with the wide field cameras ( wfc ) .",
    "these allowed to discover 16 new bursters thus increasing the known population by about 30% . among these objects , interesting is the discovery of burst emission from gs  1826 - 238 ( ubertini et al .",
    "1999a ) showing that this source , previously considered as a transient black hole candidate ( bhc ) is instead a persistent , low luminosity source with nearly periodic , extremely regular bursting behaviour .",
    "in this work i report about observations of a sample of these new bursters and discuss their broad band spectral properties , as obtained from target - of - opportunity observations by the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on board _",
    "bepposax_. this is a set of co - aligned telescopes capable of efficient , continuos spectral coverage in the band 0.1 - 220  kev ( boella et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "burst detection is the objective tool to distinguish between bh and ns binaries . in case of ns lmxb transients with sporadic x - ray outbursts , type  i bursts",
    "are often seen when the persistent emission level is above a few percent of the eddington limit , whereas bursting activity is generally absent in quiescent state .",
    "long term monitoring is then essential not also for discovering of new transients , but also for their characterization as ns or bh binaries .",
    "since lmxbs are highly concentrated towards the galactic bulge , a sensitive monitoring of this region can be obtained with pointed observations of wide field instruments . for this purpose ,",
    "a monitoring program is being performed since august 1996 by the _ bepposax_/wfc ( jager et al 1997 ) by means of observations repeated periodically during the spring and fall of each year .",
    "the monitoring itself has a sensitivity of a few mcrab , that is an order of magnitude beyond the capabilities of current all - sky monitors . at the distance of the galactic centre",
    "this sensitivity limit corresponds to a 2 - 10  kev source flux of less than @xmath6  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "this has allowed the discovery of a new population of low luminosity ns transients in the galactic bulge , probably consisting of short period binaries with evolved mass companions ( heise et al .",
    "binary systems harboring weakly magnetized ns are known to be preferentially persistent .",
    "this is possibly related to system thermal stability being induced by x - ray irradiation of the outer disk ( e.g. , king et al .",
    "this condition is more easily found in ns than in black hole binaries , but indeed it may be expected that ns systems with very low accretion rates can be transient ( king 2000 ) .",
    "currently , 9 new faint transients have been discovered by the _ bepposax_/wfc .",
    "most of them have been observed bursting , namely : the 2.5  ms accreting pulsar sax  j1808.4 - 3658 ( int zand et al .",
    "1998a ) , sax  j1748.9 - 2021 in the globular cluster ngc  6440 ( int zand et al .",

    "burst events were also observed from three other sources , for which no persistent emission was detected : sax  j1753.5 - 2349 , sax  j1806.5 - 2215 ( int zand et al .",
    "1998b ) and sax  j1752.3 - 3138",

    "sax  j1819.2 - 2525 ( int zand et al .",
    "2000 ) no bursts were detected so far .",
    "the fact that the majority of these weak transients are ns is reminiscent of the observed behavior in persistent sources , where it is found that low state x - ray bursters are much less luminous than the corresponding low state bh sources ( typically by a factor 10 to 100 , see e.g. barret et al . 2000 ) .    for this work ,",
    "i have selected a sample of x - ray bursters for which broad band spectra were obtained by means of a related _ bepposax _ too program ( see table i ) or by dedicated observations .",
    "this sample contains two weak transients , one recurrent transient ( sax  j1747.0 - 2853 ) and two persistent sources ( gs  1826 - 238 and slx 1735 - 269 ) . in remainder of the paper ,",

    "the source position is consistent with that of a soft x - ray source , rx  j1810.7 - 2609 , revealed by rosat during a follow - up observation performed 15 days later ( greiner et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "on march 11 , i.e. one day after its discovery a strong , super - eddington type  i burst was detected .",
    "this allowed an estimate of the source distance of @xmath3  kpc .",

    "sax j1810.8 - 2609 was observed again by _ bepposax _ about two days after its discovery , using the nfi .",
    "the x - ray spectrum from the source is exceptionally hard for a ns system , as the slope of the high energy power law is 1.96 and there is no visible high energy cutoff ( figure 2 ) . the best fit spectrum , yielding @xmath11=0.99 ( 161 dof ) is obtained as a sum of two components : a blackbody spectrum with a @xmath12  kev temperature , and a hard tail which results from compton up - scattering of soft seed photons , represented by a thermal distribution at @xmath13  kev ( see the referenced paper for details ) .",
    "the presence of the soft blackbody component , with a total flux of @xmath14 erg  s@xmath5  @xmath8 is highly significant , as the estimated chance probability evaluated via f - test is @xmath15 for the model given above .",
    "for this source , a two - component blackbody plus power law gives also a good fit ( @xmath11=0.97 for 163 dof ) but only the former model , which involves thermal comptonization is capable of matching the estimated value of galactic column absorption of @xmath16  @xmath8 .",

    "at higher energies , however , the lack of spatial resolution of the _ bepposax _ collimated instruments leads to source confusion .    under reasonable assumptions and excluding the spectral channels between 10.5 and 32 kev ( see natalucci et al .",

    "however , as a thermal plasma with line emission is present in the galactic centre region ( koyama et al . ,",
