    "the results that would emerge from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are expected to reveal patterns under which the standard model ( sm ) is likely to be modified at the tev scale . at these high energies",
    ", lhc is expected to unveil the mystery of large hierarchy between the electroweak and the planck scales and also produce interesting new physics signals .",
    "two well - studied scenarios of physics beyond the sm at the tev scale are extra dimension theories and supersymmetry , which will be tested at the lhc among many others .",
    "the large extra dimension model , proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite , circumvents the hierarchy problem by exploiting the geometry of extra spatial dimensions to find a mechanism to lower the planck scale .",
    "the tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes as a result of gravity propagating the full @xmath11-dimensions would mediate scattering processes and hence lead to deviations from the sm predictions . at colliders ,",
    "exchange of virtual kk modes or emission of real kk modes give rise to interesting phenomenological signals at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "virtual effects of kk modes lead to the enhancement of the cross section of pair production in processes _ viz . _  di - lepton , di - gauge boson @xmath12 , dijet @xcite in some kinematic regions .",
    "the real emission of kk modes leads to large missing @xmath13 signals _ viz .",
    "_ mono jet , mono photon , mono z boson and mono @xmath14 boson @xcite .",
    "the di - gauge boson final states have been extensively studied in the context of extra dimension models .",
    "the triple gauge boson final state is an interesting new physics signal in some of the beyond sm scenarios @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the neutral triple gauge boson production at the lhc and study how the add model would alter the sm expectation . in the sm ,",
    "the triple gauge boson final state is an important signal as it depends on the 3-point and 4-point couplings among the gauge bosons which is a test of the electroweak theory .",
    "this process in the sm has been studied to leading order ( lo ) @xcite and its extension to the next to leading order ( nlo ) was on the les houches wish list @xcite and has been finally achieved recently @xcite .",
    "the triple gauge boson production processes in the sm are the precise predictions of the electroweak gauge theory and gauge self - couplings .",
    "they are also potential background to many new physics models like supersymmetry and technicolor .",
    "for example , @xmath15 in sm is a background to signals with di - photons and missing transverse energy in gauge mediated super symmetric theories @xcite and @xmath0 production in sm is a background to one photon plus techni - pion @xcite .",
    "processes with three gauge bosons can also come from the add model as gravitons couple directly to gauge bosons of sm . while mono - jet or di - lepton production is more sensitive to parameters of models with extra - dimensions compared to the triple gauge boson production ,",
    "all these processes involve same universal coupling of gravity with the sm particles , and hence can provide equally important information about the model .",
    "moreover , in discriminating physics beyond the sm namely susy or technicolour models using triple gauge boson production , one can not ignore the potential contributions resulting from models with extra dimensions .",
    "in this analysis we consider the process @xmath16 , where we restrict to the neutral gauge bosons @xmath17 and @xmath18 is some hadronic final state .",
    "the following four final states are the subject of this analysis : ( i ) @xmath19 ( ii ) @xmath1 ( iii ) @xmath2 and ( iv ) @xmath20 .",
    "the case where @xmath21 will be part of a different paper @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the analytical calculation of the above mentioned processes with a brief introduction to the add model , section 3 is arranged to present the numerical results of our studies and finally we summarise the results in the last section .",
    "the tev scale colliders like the lhc are suitable for studying the quantum gravity effects in the add model .",
    "this model is defined in such a way that the sm particles are localised on a @xmath22-brane with negligible tension and only gravity can propagate in the full @xmath11 dimensions as it describes the geometry of the full space time .",
    "the extra spatial dimensions @xmath23 can be compactified on a @xmath23-dimensional torus with a common radius @xmath24 of macroscopic size . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective planck scale ( @xmath25 ) in 4 space - time dimensions is related to the fundamental planck scale ( @xmath26 ) in @xmath11 dimensions as follows , @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "although , the sm particles are localised on a @xmath22-brane , they can sense the extra dimensions by their interaction with gravity via the massive kk towers of the graviton .",
    "the corresponding interaction lagrangian is the following , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the energy - momentum tensor of localised sm fields and @xmath32 denotes the massive kk graviton labeled by a @xmath23-dimensional vector @xmath33 with all positive components .",
    "@xmath32 contains one spin-2 state , @xmath34 spin-1 states and @xmath35 spin-0 states , having mass , @xmath36 the zero mode of the kk tower corresponds to the massless graviton in the 4 space - time dimensions .",
    "the effective graviton propagator , after summing over all kk states , can be expressed as , @xmath37 ~~ , \\label{propagator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the invariant mass of the boson pair resulting from the decay of the kk mode and the function @xmath39 is described in @xcite , which depends on the ultra violet cut - off @xmath40 . although the interaction of kk modes with the sm particles is suppressed by the coupling @xmath41 ( eq .  ( [ lagrange ] ) ) , the cumulative effect of summing over large number of accessible kk modes ( eq .  ( [ propagator ] ) ) compensates the suppression , making the effective coupling significant enough to have observable effects .",
    "it is usual practice to set the uv cutoff @xmath42 and simplify the summation of virtual kk modes @xcite to do the phenomenology .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite for this analysis which retains the details of the number of extra dimensions .",
    "the neutral gauge boson final state at the hadron collider @xmath43 at lo comes from the sub process @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath18 is any final state hadron .",
    "the sm diagram for the above process is shown in fig .",
    "[ lo_sm ] with all possible permutations of final states . for the final state with at least two @xmath46s",
    ", the higgs could contribute by coupling to the quarks , but this is negligible in the vanishing quark mass limit . in the case of @xmath3 final state ,",
    "there are additional higgs strahlung diagrams but their contribution is also quite small and vanishes in the large higgs mass limit .",
    "hence , we have not included the processes with the higgs boson .    in the add model , the kk modes couple to @xmath47 bosons , quarks , anti - quarks as well as to quark - antiquark-@xmath47 boson vertex .",
    "the four categories of feynman diagrams that give a @xmath48 final state in add model are shown in fig .",
    "[ lo_bsm ] .",
    "we have used unitary gauge ( @xmath49 ) for z - boson and the feynman gauge ( @xmath50 ) for the photon .    in the sm , the lo process for the production of @xmath0 at hadron colliders results from the annihilation of a quark and an anti - quark . in",
    "the add model , the production mechanism is again from the same initial states but one of the photon comes from either quark or an antiquark and other two photons come from the decay of kk graviton .",
    "the typical feynman diagrams that contribute in the sm and in the add model are shown in fig .",
    "[ lo_sm ] , [ lo_bsm ] .",
    "the feynman rules for the processes with kk graviton can be found in @xcite .",
    "all the expressions for the matrix element squared with proper spin , color sums and averages are obtained using a symbolic program based on form .",
    "the kk graviton propagator in the add model is proportional to @xmath51 , @xmath52 where the invariants are @xmath53 , and @xmath54 can be evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) .",
    "the numerator of the spin-2 propagator @xcite of the kk graviton is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 is the momentum flowing through the propagator .",
    "terms proportional to negative powers of mass of kk mode in @xmath58 do not contribute as they are proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "this provides a useful check on our calculation .",
    "the matrix elements have been checked for gauge invariance .",
    "we performed similar computation for evaluating the parton level subprocesses for @xmath1 , @xmath60 and @xmath3 productions . in the following we list few of the important observations .",
    "for the @xmath1 production , in the limit @xmath61 , we reproduce the matrix elements for @xmath62 process with the changes : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the vector and axial vector couplings of the weak gauge boson respectively , @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the electric charge of the quark flavors . in the case of @xmath60 production ,",
    "we find that the parton level subprocesses in sm and add model are similar to those of the @xmath1 production with the changes @xmath69 . the squared matrix elements for @xmath60 production that come from add model alone are not related to those of @xmath0 production .",
    "the reason is that some of the terms proportional to @xmath70 that appear in the graviton-@xmath46 vertex cancel all the inverse power of @xmath70 present in the @xmath71 boson polarisation sum , giving contributions that have no analogous ones in the @xmath72 process .",
    "however , the expression for sm squared matrix elements of @xmath60 is related to that of @xmath19 process in the sm if we take @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for @xmath3 production , squared matrix elements involving add vertices do not have any relation with those of @xmath19 production for the same reason as @xmath60 production case .",
    "the sm squared matrix elements of this process are related to those for the @xmath19 process in sm with the following replacement number of z - boson with photon in the sm squared matrix element is @xmath76 , which works for all the above three processes for @xmath77 . ] in the limit @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath75 .",
    "the expressions for the squared matrix elements of the processes discussed above are too large to be presented in this paper .",
    "in this section , we present different kinematical distributions for the production of neutral triple gauge bosons .",
    "the predictions are for the lhc at center of mass energy @xmath4 tev .",
    "we have used cteq6l parton densities @xcite . for the strong coupling constant that appears in cteq6l , we use @xmath80 gev and @xmath81 flavors .",
    "we set the factorisation scale @xmath82 for the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath47 and @xmath83 for the invariant mass ( @xmath84 ) distribution of the di - boson pair .",
    "in addition we apply the following cuts on @xmath85 and the rapidity @xmath86 : @xmath87 we also ensure that in general the invariant mass of the di - boson ( _ i.e. _  any two identical bosons among the 3v ) is less than @xmath26 .",
    "we use @xmath88 gev and @xmath89 .",
    "the fine structure constant is taken as @xmath90 .    recently , both cms @xcite and atlas @xcite reported , searches for signatures of extra dimensions in the di - photon mass spectrum at the lhc for 7 tev p p collisions .",
    "the 95 % lower bound on @xmath26 vary between 2.27 - 3.53 tev depending on the number of extra dimensions @xmath91 for atlas and @xmath26 vary between 2.3 - 3.8 tev depending on the number of extra dimensions @xmath92 for cms , both using a fixed @xmath93 factor of about 1.6 @xcite .",
    "hence we have used the phenomenologically viable add model parameters @xmath94 tev and @xmath95 for present study .    for the processes involving more than one photon ,",
    "it is important to isolate photons from each other _ i.e. _  they need to be well separated in phase space so that they can be identified as separate objects in the detector . to do this we consider a cone of radius @xmath96 in the rapidity - azimuthal angle plane @xmath97 and",
    "ensure that the minimum separation between any two photons is taken to be @xmath98 . in the following ,",
    "we describe our findings for the various triple gauge boson production processes .",
    "@xmath19 production : in this case , the three photons in the final states are classified in such a way that @xmath99 .",
    "we have compared our predictions for @xmath100 distribution in the sm against those given in @xcite and found a very good agreement confirming the correct implementation of our analytical results in our numerical code . in the left panel of fig .",
