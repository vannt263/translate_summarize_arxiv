    "single - transverse spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in high - energy collisions with one transversely polarized hadron are important phenomena that have been observed for more than three decades in various physical processes @xcite . in these processes ,",
    "the observed final - state hadrons show an asymmetric distribution in a plane perpendicular to the beam direction when the transversely polarized hadron scatters off an unpolarized hadron ( or a virtual photon ) .",
    "the ssa is defined as @xmath2 , the ratio of the difference and the sum of ( differential ) cross sections when the hadron s spin vector , @xmath3 , is flipped .",
    "recent experimental measurements of ssas in polarized semi - inclusive lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) @xcite and in hadronic collisions @xcite have renewed the theoretical interest in ssas and in understanding their roles in hadron structure and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "although it was realized a long time ago @xcite that perturbative qcd can be used to study the effects of transverse spin , the size of the observed asymmetries came as a surprise and has posed a challenge for researchers in this field @xcite .    within a model calculation @xcite ,",
    "brodsky , hwang , and schmidt showed that the final state interaction in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) can generate a phase required for a nonzero ssa in sidis .",
    "it was later realized that this final state interaction can be factorized into the gauge link of the gauge invariant transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) quark distributions @xcite .",
    "the nonvanishing ssa obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is a consequence of the existence of a naively time - reversal - odd tmd quark distribution , the so - called sivers function @xcite . when applying the same calculation to the drell - yan production of lepton pairs at hadron colliders , the final state interaction in sidis becomes an initial state interaction in drell - yan , and the phase changes sign , which leads to a prediction of a sign change in the ssas between these two processes @xcite .",
    "this nontrivial `` universality '' property associated with the tmd parton distributions is the consequence of gauge interactions in qcd @xcite , and of the qcd factorization theorems for these two processes @xcite .",
    "experimental tests of this prediction will be crucial for our understanding of the origin of ssas in qcd  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed to study the sivers functions by means of a ssa in azimuthal - angular correlations of two jets produced nearly back - to - back at hadron colliders .",
    "measurements of this ssa for dijet production have begun at rhic @xcite , complementing the measurements in sidis .",
    "unlike the sidis or drell - yan process , dijet production at hadron colliders involves both initial and final state interactions that may produce the phase needed for a nonvanishing ssa .",
    "consequently , the sign and the size of the asymmetry will depend on the relative strength of these interactions . following the previous works on sidis and drell - yan , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite developed a systematic approach to describe the role of initial- and final - state interactions in generating ssas in hadronic collisions , and they found that summing all initial / final state interactions into the gauge link of the tmd parton distributions leads to a very complicated functional form of the gauge link .",
    "in particular , the tmd parton distributions studied in dijet correlations in hadronic scattering will have no connection to those in the sidis and drell - yan processes , because their definitions are completely different @xcite .",
    "one then has to question the universality of the tmd parton distributions , and the predictive power of perturbative qcd calculations , which relies on comparing physical observables with the same factorized long - distance physics while having different perturbatively calculable short - distance dynamics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we briefly reported a new result for the ssa in dijet production in hadronic collisions in the twist-3 efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman ( etqs ) approach @xcite .",
    "we considered the spin - dependent cross section , @xmath4 , for the process @xmath5 with the jet momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "when both @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the transverse components of the momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , are much larger than @xmath12 , a nonvanishing @xmath13 can be generated by the etqs mechanism in the collinear factorization approach .",
    "in this framework , the ssas are attributed to the spin - dependent twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions , which correspond to a quantum interference between different partonic scattering amplitudes .",
    "since the incoming partons are approximated to be collinear to the corresponding incoming hadrons in this approach , the momentum imbalance of the two jets is generated by producing a three - parton final - state .",
    "@xcite , we calculated the contribution from initial - state gluon radiation to @xmath13 in the kinematic region where @xmath14 .",
    "we presented the final result for the leading contributions to @xmath13 in the expansion of the partonic scattering in @xmath15 involving a hard @xmath16 subprocess . in this paper",
    ", we will provide the detailed derivations of this result , and we will also present the full contributions from all other partonic subprocesses at the same order .",
    "we find that although both initial - state and final - state interaction lead to a nonvanishing ssa , the final - state interactions give the dominant contributions to @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore expect that the ssa in dijet production will have the same sign as the sivers asymmetry in sidis .",
    "we find that at leading order in the @xmath15 expansion , the perturbatively calculated partonic parts can be further factorized into a single - scale ( @xmath8 ) hard part and perturbatively generated tmd parton distributions with transverse momenta @xmath17 .",
    "we also find that our perturbatively calculated result is equal to the leading - order term in the @xmath18 expansion of the following generalized tmd factorization formula @xcite : @xmath19_c\\ , \\delta^{(2)}(\\vec{k}_{1\\perp}+\\vec{k}_{2\\perp}+ \\vec{\\lambda}_\\perp-\\vec{q}_\\perp ) \\",

    "if we work in a singular gauge , like the light - cone gauge , an additional gauge link at the spatial infinity ( @xmath47 ) will have to be included in order to ensure the gauge invariance of the above definitions @xcite .",
    "we have chosen tmd parton distributions defined in sidis because of the dominance of final - state interactions .",
    "choosing tmd parton distributions defined according to the drell - yan process would change the sign of the partonic hard factors , but not affect the overall sign of the physical cross section .",
    "we note that the various factors in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , apart from being functions of transverse momentum , also depend on the renormalization and factorization scales , and especially on the gluon rapidity cut - off when higher - order corrections are taken into account  .",

    "using the collinear factorization approach , we find that like the spin - dependent case , the leading contribution in the @xmath15 expansion of the perturbatively calculated partonic scatterings can be further factorized into a hard part at a single - scale @xmath8 and perturbatively generated unpolarized tmd parton distributions with transverse momenta @xmath17 .",

    "a key feature of any qcd factorization is that the perturbatively calculated short - distance hard factors should not be sensitive to details of the _ factorized _ long distance physics . in this paper",

    "we find that the hard - scattering factors derived in this model are in fact the same as those derived in the collinear factorization approach , despite of the clear difference in the treatment of the nucleon . both the spin - averaged and the spin - dependent cross sections calculated in this model are therefore consistent with the generalized factorization formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ e4]),([e2 ] ) .    to fully investigate the above factorization formalism",
    ", we would have to consider the contributions from gluon interactions and radiations in all possible regions of the phase space , and to all orders in perturbation theory , which is not what we are trying to do in this paper . instead , as a step to test the above factorization formalism",

    ", we will be able to show how to factorize this gluon into the tmd parton distributions of the incoming nucleons , and to verify the definition of the tmd parton distributions used in the generalized factorization formulas .",
    "our first order calculation at @xmath53 clearly shows the factorization of a hard part at @xmath54 and that the radiation of a collinear gluon can be absorbed into the relevant tmd parton distributions .",

    "one interesting moment is the following : @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the twist-3 matrix element of the quark - gluon correlation function defined in eq .",
    "( [ tf ] ) @xcite .",
    "it is also related to the @xmath260-moment of the tmd quark sivers function , see eq .",
    "( [ e34 ] ) .",
    "an advantage of taking this moment of the asymmetry is that the transverse momentum integrals of the various factors in the factorization formula decouple from each other , without further assumptions for the @xmath260-dependence of the tmd distributions .",
    "in fact , the ssa in the @xmath9 moment of the dijet momentum imbalance is effectively a physical quantity with only a _ single _ large observed scale , @xmath8 .",
    "for such an observable , the conventional collinear factorization is more appropriate . in this case , all partons transverse momentum dependence is integrated into the usual collinear parton distributions .",
    "the hard factors we obtained above for all the partonic channels agree with those given in @xcite , although a very different approach was adopted there . in @xcite , in order to investigate the @xmath9-moment of the single spin asymmetry , the appropriate gauge links were derived and expanded to first order in @xmath261 . since both approaches have included the initial / final state interactions in their formalisms , they should agree with each other at this order .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the asymmetric production of two jets in hadronic collisions . using the collinear factorization approach in perturbative qcd , we calculated both the spin - averaged and the spin - dependent differential cross section for the hadronic production of dijets with momentum imbalance @xmath9 , in a kinematic region where @xmath262 . at the first nonvanishing order ,",
    "the momentum imbalance is generated by radiating a gluon with transverse momentum equal to the imbalance . in the limit when the imbalance @xmath9 is much less than the averaged jet momentum @xmath8 , we derived the leading - power contribution to the cross sections in the @xmath15 expansion when the radiated gluon is nearly parallel to one of the incoming hadrons .",
    "we found that the perturbatively calculated leading contributions to both the spin - averaged and the spin - dependent cross sections can be factorized into a partonic hard part which is a function of @xmath8 , and into perturbatively generated tmd parton distributions at @xmath248 .",
    "our results derived in the collinear factorization approach in the limit @xmath263 reproduce the same factorized expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ e37]),([e39 ] ) that were derived as the leading order terms of the generalized tmd factorization formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ e4]),([e2 ] ) when the observed @xmath9 is solely due to the perturbatively generated tmd parton distribution of one of the incoming hadrons .",
    "the consistency between the results derived in the collinear factorization approach and those derived by expanding the generalized tmd factorization formulas in eqs .  ( [ e4]),([e2 ] ) to the same order naturally leads us to ask if the generalized tmd factorization formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ e4]),([e2 ] ) are actually valid for the hadronic dijet production to all orders in perturbative qcd when @xmath264 , like the tmd factorization formulas for drell - yan and sidis . _ if this were true _ , the consistency that we demonstrated in this paper in the overlap region where @xmath50 would effectively provide a unified picture and treatment for the hadronic dijet production over the full kinematic range of jet momenta : using the tmd factorization formalism when the dijet momentum imbalance is small and the collinear factorization approach when it is large .",
    "this is exactly what was achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite for the drell - yan and sidis processes .",
    "however , as we mentioned at the beginning of sec .",
    "iii , showing the consistency between two factorized formalisms at the leading order when @xmath265 is not sufficient to prove the tmd factorization formula over its full kinematic region .",
    "when we started with the collinear factorization approach to calculate the momentum imbalance of the dijet cross section , we already took as a fact that the long - distance interaction between the hadrons / jets at their mass scales , @xmath266 , are factorized for the given @xmath267 .",
    "that is , our results derived in the limit @xmath265 are valid when @xmath268 ; but , our derivation does not address the issues concerning the factorization of the interactions between the hadrons / jets when @xmath269 or the mass scale of the hadrons / jets involved .",
    "the consistency that we demonstrated here is certainly a necessary condition that needs to be satisfied should the tmd factorization formulas be valid .    for the tmd factorization to be true",
    ", we need to establish two key facts : the partonic hard part at @xmath54 must be insensitive to any physics at the scale @xmath78 , and the tmd parton distributions at the scale @xmath9 should be process independent and universal , or at least , `` quasi''-universal up to a sign change @xcite . in this paper , we also calculated in sec .  ii the partonic hard parts at @xmath57 by using the brodsky - hwang - schmidt model with the proper color factor for the interaction vertices .",
    "we derived the partonic hard parts from the lowest order scattering diagrams and showed that the dynamics of partonic scattering at scale @xmath57 is independent of the model of nucleon that we used in our derivation .",
    "since the ssa can be generated by either initial- or final - state interactions , the color flow of the partonic scattering in the dijet momentum imbalance is very different from that of drell - yan and sidis .",
    "since all poles from the initial- and final - state one gluon interactions contribute to the ssa , and the color factor for each individual scattering diagram is insensitive to the long - distance details of the nucleon because there is only one unique color structure for the active quark - gluon combination at this order , we were able to factor the process - dependent as well as the diagram - specific color factors along with the partonic hard parts , and leave the physics at scale @xmath270 in the tmd parton distributions defined in sidis . by doing that",
    ", we found that the resulting full partonic hard parts are the same as those derived in the collinear factorization approach .",
    "however , for a full tmd factorization , we will have to show that the poles from multiple gluon interactions can be exponentiated into the gauge link that defines the tmd parton distributions , while leaving the same partonic hard parts with the same color factors .",
    "due to the mixture of initial- and final - state interactions and the complications of color flows , this task is very non - trivial and is beyond the scope of this paper .    to better understand the dijet momentum imbalance in hadronic collisions , a number of extensions can be performed based on our results .",
    "first , in this paper , we have only studied the contribution of one gluon radiation collinear to one of the incident hadrons .",
    "this should be extended to other kinematic regions of the gluon .",
    "for example , when the gluon is radiated parallel to the final state jets or hadrons , it is important to see how the corresponding contribution can be accommodated by the jet definition , or be factorized into the fragmentation functions for the hadron , especially in the spin - dependent case . another important kinematic regime is when the radiated gluon becomes soft .",
    "it is very important to see if the resulting contribution can be factorized into a soft factor , as predicted by the tmd factorization formalism .",
    "in addition , in this paper we have only discussed the ssa for dijet correlations , which has sivers - type contributions . for the related di - hadron correlations ,",
    "one expects also the collins mechanism to be important , and it will be interesting to explore it and the factorization properties of the corresponding spin - dependent cross section . the method and procedure used in this paper should provide useful guidance in all these related studies .    we finally note that if the tmd factorization indeed fails , a careful comparison between our results and experimental data as the momentum imbalance @xmath15 decreases could furnish an ideal test of the breaking of factorization and provide new opportunities to explore qcd dynamics .",
