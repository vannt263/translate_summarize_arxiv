    "the origins of the light elements li , be , and b ( libeb ) differ from that of the other nuclides . most elements are formed in stars , but libeb are rapidly consumed by radiative capture reactions in stellar centers and must therefore be synthesized in cooler or more tenuous environments .",
    "it had been generally accepted @xcite that @xmath0li , @xmath4be , @xmath5b , and some @xmath6b were made in the galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) by the interaction of fast gcr protons and @xmath7 particles with interstellar targets of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen ( cno ) or he ( and vice - versa ) ; @xmath8h , @xmath9he , and the primeval abundance of @xmath1li were made in the big bang .",
    "recent measurements of abundances in metal - poor stars formed early in the life of the galaxy challenge the details of the gcr picture .",
    "the abundance of @xmath4be rises linearly with the iron abundance@xcite .",
    "it has been argued ( see @xcite and references therein ) that this means that heavy cosmic rays ( cno ) incident on interstellar hydrogen and helium are responsible for the synthesis of libeb .",
    "others@xcite argue that the original process remains viable . in any case",
    "the @xmath2 reaction plays a major role in production of @xmath10li , particularly if light cosmic rays are responsible for their synthesis@xcite , since the interstellar medium contains little cno in the early galaxy .",
    "recent models @xcite show that @xmath0li is marginally produced in the observed quantity , so that accurate estimates of the li - producing reactions are required for a rigorous test of these models .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath2 cross sections@xcite are not known at high enough energies for such purposes  no data are available for @xmath0li production above 200 mev , although the cosmic ray @xmath7-particle flux remains strong beyond this energy @xcite .",
    "the predicted early - galaxy abundances of @xmath0li can vary significantly ( for example , by a factor of two in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , depending on how the lower energy cross sections are extrapolated to higher energy .    to provide the necessary data , we measured angular distributions of @xmath11 ejectiles from the @xmath12 reaction for alpha energies between 159 and 620 mev , and integrated these distributions to obtain the total production cross sections for masses 6 and 7 .",
    "we find that the cross sections fall rapidly , essentially exponentially , with increasing bombarding energy , becoming small enough that @xmath13 will not contribute significantly to cosmic ray nucleosynthesis at energies above the measured range ( to 620 mev ) .",
    "the cross sections at bombarding energies above 160 mev were expected to be small , leading to potentially severe problems of background scattering and long collection times if a traditional gas cell approach was used , as in previous measurements@xcite . to avoid these problems , we employed two novel techniques : ( 1 ) the detectors were placed inside the target gas volume to eliminate background scattering from target cell walls and windows , and ( 2 ) a telescope system with a wide and continuous acceptance in laboratory scattering angle was used to reduce data collection time .",
    "details of the target , detector telescopes , beam , and angle and acceptance calibrations are given below .",
    "the target was natural helium gas , @xmath1499.99% pure , which filled the nscl 92-inch scattering chamber ; the gas pressure ranged from 370 to 408 torr ( measured to @xmath15 ) and the temperature was 23@xmath16c .",
    "a schematic of the chamber is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the chamber housed a remotely operable turntable on which the detectors were mounted , and the effective target was a cylinder of gas extending approximately 135 cm upstream and 15 cm downstream from the center of the turntable .",
    "the entrance window was a 6.4 @xmath17 m havar foil which was located 150 cm upstream from the turntable center and was partially blocked from view of the detectors by lead shielding .",
    "the chamber was evacuated on several occasions to check background from the entrance foil . only at the most forward laboratory scattering angles ( @xmath18 ) were background subtractions for window scattering necessary , and these subtractions were smaller than 20% of the total observed yield at any angle .",
    "a target ladder was located at the center of the turntable , and held secondary targets used for beam monitoring and calibration : a 47 mg / cm@xmath8 carbon foil , a 0.5 mm diameter `` pinhole , '' a 1 mm diameter vertical steel  needle , \" a 2 mm thick aluminum target with a 20 mm diameter hole , and a scintillator .",
    "this ladder was lowered completely out of the beam path during data collection with the primary ( helium ) target .",
    "beams of @xmath7 particles were provided by the nscl k1200 cyclotron at nominal energies of 160 , 280 , and 620 mev .",
    "the lowest energy was chosen to allow direct comparison with results of @xcite , and the higher energies were chosen to span the region of astrophysical interest .",
    "all beams were fully stripped upon arrival at the scattering chamber . up to @xmath20 mev",
    "is deposited in the entrance foil and target gas prior to the reaction , depending on the initial energy and point of scatter .",
    "the average bombarding energies , accounting for these losses and the 0.2 mev uncertainty in the measured energy , were @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev , and @xmath23 mev .",
    "the beam spot was checked by periodic insertion of two scintillators viewed by tv cameras , located at the turntable center and 170 cm upstream of turntable center .",
    "the beam radius at the turntable was @xmath24 mm and the calculated half - angle divergence @xmath25 .",
    "possible beam halo was monitored by periodically inserting the aluminum  hole \" target and looking for scattered particles ; no significant halo was observed .",
    "the unscattered beam was collected in a vacuum - isolated faraday cup 2 meters downstream from the scattering chamber , and integrated beam current was found with @xmath265% uncertainty using a bic model 1000 current integrator .",
    "two detector telescopes were fixed to the turntable at beam height , one on each side of the beam .",
    "each telescope consisted of a stack of two @xmath27 cm tall @xmath28 @xmath29 cm wide charge - division position - sensitive silicon detectors ( psds ) and one 3 cm thick csi(tl ) scintillator viewed by photodiodes , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in telescope 1 the psds had thicknesses of 320 @xmath17 m ( front ) and 1000 @xmath17 m ( back ) , and were located 300 and 367 mm from the turntable center . in telescope 2 ,",
    "the psds had thicknesses of 300 @xmath17 m ( front ) and 480 @xmath17 m ( back ) , and were located 300 and 363 mm from the turntable center , 80@xmath16 clockwise from telescope 1 .",
    "standard electronics were used for signal amplification and data acquisition .    with",
    "the turntable centered , each telescope viewed a laboratory scattering angle range of 7@xmath1660@xmath16 simultaneously .",
    "five different turntable settings were used during data collection ; at a given scattering angle this provided independent measurements with a variety of solid - angle acceptance conditions .",
    "the turntable settings were centered ( as shown in fig .  1 ) , rotated @xmath30 from the centered position , and rotated @xmath31 .",
    "the smallest laboratory angle observed was @xmath32 , seen only by the telescope rotated closest to the beam for @xmath33 settings .    the telescopes provided distinct particle identification for @xmath34 ejectiles from characteristic @xmath35-@xmath36 signatures in the psds . in some kinematic situations the ejectile penetrated both psds and stopped in the csi(tl ) scintillator ; in this case the energy deposited in the scintillator was also used to aid particle identification .",
    "the mass resolution was about 0.4 amu fwhm , sufficient to distinguish @xmath0li and @xmath1li .",
    "the energy resolution was sufficient to distinguish elastically scattered @xmath37he from @xmath37he produced in inelastic channels such as @xmath37he@xmath38he ( @xmath39mev ) ; however , discrimination between the @xmath37he@xmath40li channel ( @xmath41mev ) and the @xmath37he@xmath42li channel ( @xmath43mev ) was unreliable , particularly at the higher energies .",
    "it was not possible to distinguish the particle - stable first excited state in @xmath1li or @xmath1be ( 0.48 mev and 0.43 mev , respectively ) from the ground state .",
    "the first excited state in @xmath0li ( 2.18 mev ) decays immediately to @xmath44 and does not contribute significantly to @xmath0li production .",
    "the second excited state in @xmath0li ( 3.56 mev ) is particle - stable , but it was not possible to distinguish it from the ground state .",
    "since the primary concern of the present experiment is total production cross sections , these resolution limitations are not important .    for a valid event",
    ", both psds in a telescope must detect the scattered particle . the impact position on each psd",
    "is inferred using standard charge - division techniques ; from these impact positions and the known spacing between the psds it is possible to derive the scattering angle @xmath45 and the scattering position @xmath46 along the beam axis .",
    "the scattering angle is needed for computing the differential cross sections @xmath47 , and the @xmath46 position is needed to exclude particles that may have scattered in the havar entrance foil .",
    "angle calibration is performed by stepping each telescope through a pinhole - collimated @xmath7 beam .",
    "the calibration was tested by reconstructing the tracks of particles scattered from a  needle \" target protruding into the beam and from four @xmath48 m kapton foils that could be inserted at various locations along the beam path .",
    "angular resolution was about 1.2@xmath16 fwhm and was not degraded significantly when the chamber was filled with helium .",
    "differential cross sections are found from the observed yields according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the observed number of particles at the laboratory scattering angle @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the number of incident particles , @xmath53 is the detection system live fraction , and @xmath54 is the target density ( nuclei/@xmath55 ) .",
    "the detector acceptance is denoted by @xmath56 and has units of cm .",
    "@xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the effective solid angle , @xmath59 is the effective length of the target , @xmath60 is the detector efficiency , and @xmath61 is the transmission fraction of scattered particles .",
    "@xmath56 depends primarily on the geometry of the detector and the incident beam .",
    "it is determined by comparing our observed yields of elastically scattered @xmath37he at 160 mev with the laboratory cross sections reported by nadasen _",
    "_ @xcite at a similar energy .",
    "the data of @xcite have better angular resolution than the present experiment , and had to be slightly degraded before the comparison . by solving equation ( 1 ) for @xmath56 in one degree ( laboratory frame ) bins",
    ", we calibrate the acceptance for all angles of interest .",
    "the process is repeated for each of the five turntable settings .    for practical purposes",
    "the @xmath56 calibration is independent of energy and particle species .",
    "energy or species dependence can occur because of transmission losses through the target gas or reactions in the si or csi detectors .",
    "the former is always less than 1% in the kinematic region of interest .",
    "reaction losses in the detectors can cause a loss of a few percent of detector efficiency in the worst cases .",
    "however , losses in the @xmath11 efficiency tend to offset the losses in the efficiency for @xmath37he particles used for calibration , and the net effects are much smaller than the quoted uncertainty .",
    "although different particles have different cutoff angles ( this occurs when the the particle energy is insufficient to penetrate the first psd ) , the cutoff angles are all in the backward c.m .",
    "hemisphere , which is not used in the analysis .",
    "several quality checks were applied to the @xmath56 calibration .",
    "( 1 ) the differential cross sections derived from the five different turntable angles were compared , and were found to be consistent .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath56 was compared with ( somewhat simplified ) monte carlo simulations of the detector geometry and were found to agree within 12% .",
    "( 3 ) our @xmath62 differential cross sections at 160 mev are in excellent agreement with those by glagola , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which lends confidence to our methods .",
    "we estimate a systematic uncertainty of 8% , which is dominated by the absolute uncertainty in the results of ref . @xcite .",
    "the differential and total cross sections were measured for the four reactions @xmath37he@xmath63he , @xmath37he@xmath64li , @xmath37he@xmath65li , and @xmath37he@xmath66be .",
    "because the target and projectile are identical , reaction products are distributed symmetrically about @xmath67 c.m . ; it is then sufficient to determine yields only for @xmath68 .",
    "detector acceptance for events from the backward c.m .",
    "hemisphere was rather low because the low energy ejectiles stopped in the 300 @xmath17 m or 320 @xmath17 m psds .",
    "in all four reactions of interest , the kinematics are `` folded '' so that each laboratory angle corresponds to two c.m .",
    "scattering angles .",
    "for the two - body final states leading to @xmath1li and @xmath1be , it is a simple matter to distinguish between the two c.m.angles , because a larger ejectile energy is always associated with the more forward angle .",
    "there is an added complication for @xmath0li and @xmath0he due to the three - body exit channels @xmath0he@xmath69 and @xmath0li@xmath70 .",
    "we determined a locus of ejectile energies corresponding to 90@xmath16 c.m .",
    ", as a function of laboratory scattering angle , from the kinematics result @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the momentum of @xmath0li and @xmath73 is the velocity of the center of mass ; all quantities are measured in the lab .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "all @xmath0li ejectiles observed with energies above this locus were attributed to the forward c.m .",
    "hemisphere , and those with less energy were attributed to the backward hemisphere .",
    "a similar procedure was used for the @xmath0he data .",
    "one can , in principle , distinguish the @xmath37he@xmath40li reaction from the @xmath37he@xmath74li reaction , as it is restricted to a band labeled  0 mev \" in fig .",
    "this was done in refs.@xcite , but our energy resolution made it impossible ; this is not a limitation for use of these cross sections in calculations of cosmic ray nucleosynthesis .",
    "the differential cross sections ( forward c.m",
    ".  hemisphere only ) for @xmath0li and @xmath0he are shown in fig .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath0li are forward peaked at all three energies .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath0he are also forward peaked and are roughly @xmath75 as large as those for @xmath0li .",
    "it was not possible to measure the cross section for @xmath0he at 620 mev due to background contamination from @xmath9he ejectiles .",
    "we established that the @xmath0he cross section at 620 mev is less than 25% of the cross section for @xmath0li at this energy .",

    "the cross sections for both isotopes are forward - peaked with a minimum at 90@xmath16 c.m . ; they are in excellent agreement with the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite at a similar energy .",
    "the cross sections at 280 mev are two orders of magnitude smaller , approaching the limit of our experimental method , and the minima at 90@xmath16 disappear . at 620 mev",
    "the cross sections were very small : fewer than two dozen possible @xmath1li and @xmath1be events were observed , roughly consistent with background .",
    "an upper limit is obtained at 620 mev .",
    "total cross sections for @xmath76 production were found by extrapolating the differential cross sections to zero degrees , integrating over all laboratory angles corresponding to @xmath77 , and doubling to account for the @xmath78c.m .",
    "the extrapolation to zero degrees is based on a linear fit through the three smallest - angle points ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "the extrapolated cross section @xmath81 typically accounts for @xmath82% of the total cross section , and up to one third of the random uncertainty .",

    "the measured cross sections for @xmath0he and @xmath0li differ from the values of glagola _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite near 160 mev by about a factor of two .",

    "the total cross sections decrease rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "6 are weighted exponential fits through all points shown , and have the functional forms ( with the bombarding energy , @xmath83 , in mev and the slope for @xmath0he taken to be identical to that obtained for @xmath0li ) @xmath84 @xmath85 the exponential falloff is shallower than that suggested by woo _",
    "et al._@xcite , who report fits proportional to @xmath86 for both @xmath0he and @xmath0li .",
    "the difference is understandable because the reanalyzed lower energy data @xcite were not available to woo _",
    "et al._. the interpolated line for @xmath0he lies somewhat above the upper limit from @xcite at 198 mev , but in general the data form a consistent set .",
    "the cross section for @xmath0li at 620 mev lies significantly above the fitted exponential .",
    "total cross sections for @xmath1li and @xmath1be are found by extrapolating the differential cross sections to zero degrees , integrating from @xmath87 in the c.m .",
    "frame , and doubling , as in the @xmath76 analysis .",
    "results are shown in fig .  7 and in table ii along with other measurements from 60 to 600 mev .",
    "our result at 159.3 mev is in excellent agreement with those of glagola @xcite near 160 mev ; an exponential describes the entire data set very well .",
    "our experiment yields a significantly tighter upper bound for the @xmath1be cross section near 600 mev than that given in @xcite , and a new limit for @xmath1li . as expected , since the channels are isospin mirrors , the @xmath1li and @xmath1be cross sections are similar in size and energy dependence .",
    "weighted exponential fits yield : @xmath88 @xmath89 these results are quite similar to that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath90 .    since @xmath0he decays to @xmath0li by @xmath91 emission , with a half - life of about 807 msec , the @xmath37he@xmath63he and @xmath37he@xmath64li reactions are both a source of @xmath0li produced in the cosmic rays .",
    "therefore , the sum of @xmath0li and @xmath0he cross sections at each energy is also given in table i. in cases where @xmath0he measurements are not available , the sum includes an estimate for the @xmath0he contribution , equal to 12% of the @xmath0li cross section ( 103.0 and 619.7 mev ) or equal to the reported upper limit ( 0.2 mb ) for @xmath0he at 198.4 mev .    in fig .",
    "8 we show the mass6 cross sections , the sum of the cross section for @xmath0li and @xmath0he . as was already clear from the fits shown in fig",
    ".  6 , an exponential fit would lie significantly ( about three standard deviations ) below the point at 620 mev .",
    "the fit shown includes an energy independent cross section and describes the data well ; it should be useful for applications .",
    "it would be desirable to use a form that more accurately reflects possible physical processes at high energy , but the data is sufficient to fix only one parameter beyond the low energy exponential ; adding a constant cross section is the simplest choice .",
    "the resulting constant cross section is much smaller than the uncertainty in the low energy cross sections .",
    "the sum of the @xmath37he@xmath65li and @xmath37he@xmath65be cross sections is also given in table ii for each energy .",
    "since @xmath1be decays by electron capture to @xmath1li with a half - life of 53.3 days , these are the relevant cross sections for calculation of @xmath1li production in cosmic rays .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "8 shows the sum of the @xmath1li and @xmath1be cross sections , an exponential fit to the data , and a fit including a constant cross section .",
    "the exponential or exponential - plus - constant cross section forms shown in fig .",
    "8 provide a convenient description of the data for use in applications .",
    "for the total mass-6 and mass-7 yields these are @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94",
    "with these new cross sections for production of @xmath11 by the @xmath2 reaction , it is possible to calculate the amounts of @xmath0li and @xmath1li produced in early - galaxy cosmic rays more accurately .",
    "the need to extrapolate cross sections to high energies is no longer a significant factor in the uncertainty .",
    "because of the smaller cross sections obtained here for mass-6 the the production of @xmath0li will be significantly smaller than would be obtained with cross sections from the the summary of read and viola@xcite .    to illustrate these points , we use",
    "a cosmic ray spectrum peaked around 200 mev / nucleon ( specifically , fig .",
    "2b of ref.@xcite , the curve labeled @xmath95 g / cm@xmath8 .",
    "the product of this spectrum and various cross sections was integrated over energy .",
    "a comparison of results using our cross sections and those of read and viola@xcite is useful , because most calculations of cosmic ray nucleosynthesis have used the read - viola cross sections . both an exponential fit ( not shown ) and the exponential plus background fit ( eq .",
    "7 ) shown in fig .  8 yield about 50% of the @xmath0li obtained using the cross sections of read and viola . for @xmath1li the differences are relatively small , because the reaction cross sections are already quite small by 200 mev , and because upper limits for @xmath1be at higher energies had been reported . for the cosmic ray spectrum employed here ( and using the read - viola cross sections for @xmath96 mev )",
    "the production rates of @xmath1li and @xmath0li are nearly equal , with @xmath1li production larger by about 10% .",
    "detailed calculations of the effects of the new cross sections and the suggested renormalizations of lower energy cross sections@xcite will be reported at a later date @xcite . in general",
    "they will result in a significant reduction of the calculated cosmic ray production of @xmath0li by @xmath2 reactions .",
    "the reduction is dependent on the cosmic ray spectrum and will be largest when it has a large component above 200 mev .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross sections at high energies , that is , the expected limit of the observed exponential behavior , remains an issue .",
    "we are not aware of detailed studies of this phenomenon . in the case of mass-6",
    ", a deviation from exponential behavior is required by the data , and we have assumed a constant value at higher energies . in the case of mass-7 , there is no convincing evidence for such a deviation .",
    "however , given the deviation seen for mass-6 , we have provided for mass-7 , as alternatives , pure exponential and constant - plus - exponential fits to the data . for the cosmic ray spectrum we have chosen , the difference between the two assumptions affects the mass-7 yield at only the 0.4% level .",
    "the production of @xmath0li and @xmath1li by @xmath97 reactions will play a vital role in reaching an understanding of the synthesis of libeb and the nature of the cosmic rays .",
    "the critical questions are whether the @xmath1li observed in old metal - poor stars is that produced in the big bang , or whether big bang @xmath1li has been affected by production in cosmic rays and destruction by stellar processing .",
    "recent data indicate that the amount of li increases with time , presumably an indication of cosmic ray production .",
    "however , our data bear more strongly on the possibility of stellar destruction of @xmath10li .",
    "since @xmath0li is more fragile than @xmath1li , its survival in a star can be used to limit the amount of @xmath1li depletion .    in order to use @xmath0li in this way",
    ", the amount of @xmath0li formed must be estimated from a model for cosmic ray nucleosynthesis ( very little @xmath0li is made in the big bang ) and then compared to its observed abundance . the resulting @xmath0li destruction",
    "might then be used to estimate the amount of @xmath1li destruction and eventually , the primordial abundance of @xmath1li . in recent models ( see for example@xcite ) the production of @xmath0li is marginally sufficient or too small , even assuming none has been destroyed during stellar evolution .",
