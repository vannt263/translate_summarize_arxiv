    "the capital asset pricing model is based on variance as the measure of risk .",
    "however , it has been clear from the outset that this way of measuring risk has a serious drawback : it penalizes high profits in exactly the same way as high losses .",
    "already in his 1959 book  @xcite markowitz suggested semivariance as a substitute for variance .",
    "but although semivariance is wiser than variance as a measure of risk , it is less convenient analytically and for this reason did not find its way to finance .    in 1997",
    ", a fundamentally new way of measuring risk was proposed by artzner , delbaen , eber , and heath  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they introduced the concept of a _ coherent risk measure_. in our opinion , these measures of risk are definitely wiser than the standard ones , i.e. variance and v@r .",
    "these new risk measures have already occupied a considerable part of the modern financial mathematics ( see the literature review in  @xcite ) , and their theory is progressing at an impressive speed .",
    "we believe that within a few decades they will occupy a firm position in practice also .",
    "the theory of coherent risk measures is already termed in some sources the `` third revolution in finance '' ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a coherent risk measure is a function on the random variables of the form @xmath2{0mm}{1mm}}}_{{\\mathsf{q}}\\in{\\mathcal{d}}}{\\mathsf{e}}_{\\mathsf{q}}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a set of probability measures termed _",
    "probabilistic scenarios_. from the financial point of view , @xmath4 is the discounted p&l produced by some portfolio over the unit time period .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is the minimal capital needed for the expected terminal wealth to be positive under each scenario .",
    "the above definition is very general . for practical purposes one needs to select a convenient subclass .",
    "one of the best subclasses of coherent risk measures known so far is _",
    "tail v@r _ defined as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] is a fixed number and @xmath8 is the @xmath9-quantile of  @xmath4 ( one can check that this is indeed a coherent risk measure )",
    ". however , its empirical estimation might be problematic due to the scarcity of tail events . in  @xcite , we proposed a coherent risk measure , which has a very clear meaning and admits a very simple estimation procedure .",
    "we called it _",
    "alpha v@r_. it is a risk measure of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a fixed number and @xmath12 are independent copies of  @xmath4 .",
    "we believe that the family of alpha v@rs ( indexed by  @xmath13 ) is the best one - parameter family of coherent risk measures .",
    "we also introduced in  @xcite the class _ beta v@r _ , which , in our opinion , is the best two - parameter family of coherent risks .",
    "the first basic task of this paper is : _ to build the capm based on coherent risk measures_. the three main results of the capm are :    establishing the sml relation .    finding the form of an agent s optimal portfolio .    finding the market risk premium .",
    "we provide coherent - based counterparts of these results .",
    "rewards and empirical asset pricing . *",
    "a very hot topic in the modern academic finance literature is the relationship between the real - world and the risk - neutral measures .",
    "one trend consists in estimating the real - world measure from the risk - neutral one ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another trend is comparing the real - world and the risk - neutral measures to derive the empirical pricing kernel ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our results on the capm show that , in addition to the real - world measure and the risk - neutral measure , the third measure plays a fundamental role : @xmath14    the notion of an extreme measure was introduced in  @xcite in order to define the coherent risk contribution .",
    "consider a firm measuring its risk by a coherent risk measure  @xmath15 and producing a discounted p&l  @xmath16 over the unit time period .",
    "the corresponding extreme measure is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the set standing in  .",
    "let @xmath4 be the discounted p&l produced by some trade over the same period . as shown in  (",
    "* subsect .",
    "2.5 ) , if @xmath4 is small as compared to  @xmath16 , then @xmath18 it is seen from this relation that the notion of an extreme measure is very useful for the risk measurement purposes . as found in  @xcite , this notion is also very useful for the risk management purposes : we prove that if the desks of a firm are measuring coherent risk contributions rather than outstanding risks and the desks are allowed to trade risk limits between them , then the desks find themselves the globally optimal portfolio .",
    "furthermore , the fair price intervals corresponding to various pricing techniques ( optimality pricing , equilibrium pricing ) considered in  @xcite are expressed through extreme measures ; the solution of the capital allocation problem considered in  @xcite is expressed through extreme measures ; see also our paper  @xcite , where the extreme measure serves as one of the most natural examples of valuation measures .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain the following relationship : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the real - world measure , @xmath21 is the market extreme measure ( i.e. this is the extreme measure corresponding to the change of the market index like s&p  500 ) , @xmath22 is the risk - neutral measure , and @xmath23 is the risk premium for the market portfolio . to be more precise , @xmath22 is a particular representative of the class of risk - neutral measures , which we term the _ contact measure_. it is closely connected with the _ no better choice pricing _ introduced in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsect .",
    "the relationship between @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is illustrated by the following diagram :    ( 150,12)(-14,-4 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 5,0 ) ( 120,0 ) ( 0,0)(1,0)120 ( -1.5,2)@xmath20 ( 3.5,2)@xmath22 ( 118,2)@xmath21    a very important feature here is that @xmath23 is very small , and a powerful lever arises .",
    "the measure @xmath21 admits a simple theoretical representation and an efficient empirical estimation procedure . with this measure",
    ", we thus have a powerful tool for the analysis of the relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "having estimated @xmath21 , we can move along the line @xmath24 this enables us to estimate the expectations of various variables with respect to  @xmath20 , i.e. rewards .",
    "the importance of this descends from the fact that the direct empirical estimation of rewards is known to be virtually impossible ( see the discussion in  @xcite and the 20s example in  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that the expected returns are very small , so that a slight misspecification of the data leads to a significant _ relative _ change in the estimated expected returns .    according to",
    ", the expected discounted profit earned by the @xmath25-th asset is @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the discounted p&l produced by the @xmath25-th asset over the unit time period .",
    "this is , in fact , the coherent - based analog of the sml relation .",
    "the value @xmath23 is very small , so that @xmath28 is a medium size number , and it admits effective empirical estimation procedures ( the above lever at work ! ) .",
    "it is hard to estimate @xmath23 in practice , but for the decision making purposes one typically needs to know the values @xmath29 up to multiplication by a joint constant .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to know only the values @xmath28 . for these values",
    "we provide simple empirical estimation procedures .",
    "another way that we can follow is to move along the line @xmath30 this methodology leads to the following coherent variant of the empirical asset pricing : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the payoff of a contingent claim and @xmath33 is the price of  @xmath32 .",
    "a similar representation is provided for sensitivity coefficients .",
    "the expressions for  @xmath33 and for the sensitivity coefficients admit efficient empirical estimation procedures .    *",

    "[ reap ] , we introduce the extreme measure of the market , describe its relationship with the no better choice pricing , and apply it to estimating rewards as well as to the empirical asset pricing .",
