    "the phenomenon of shear localization during high strain - rate deformations of metals @xcite is a striking instance of material instability in mechanics , that has attracted considerable attention in the mechanics literature ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) as well as a number of mathematical studies ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "material instability is typically associated with ill - posedness of an underlying initial value problem , what has coined the term _ hadamard instability _ for its description in the mechanics literature .",
    "it should however be emphasized that while hadamard instability indicates the catastrophic growth of oscillations around a mean state , what is observed in localization is the orderly albeit extremely fast development of coherent structures : the shear bands .",
    "the latter is a nonlinear phenomenon and a linearized analysis can only serve as a precursor to such behavior .",
    "we work with the simplest model capturing the mechanism of shear band formation , a simple shear motion of a non - newtonian fluid with temperature decreasing viscosity @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 describes the strain - rate sensitivity which typically in these problems satisfies @xmath3 . mathematical studies of , for power law viscosities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , show that the uniform shear is asymptotically stable for @xmath6 @xcite , but indicate unstable response in the complementary region @xmath7 , @xcite .",
    "the mathematical analysis has not so far characterized the precise behavior in the instability region ; however , detailed and resolved numerical studies ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) show that instability is followed by formation of shear bands .",
    "the difficulty is that in order to analyze the unstable regime one needs to account for the combined effect of parabolic regularizations in conjunction to ill - posed initial value problems .",
    "an asymptotic theory for calculating an effective equation for the compound effect is proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the theory of relaxation systems and the chapman - enskog expansion and produces an effective asymptotic equation . for a power law the effective equation changes type from forward to backward parabolic , across the threshold @xmath8 of the parameter space .",
    "the criteria of @xcite are based on asymptotic analysis and as such are formal in nature .",
    "our objective , here , is to develop a mathematical theory for the onset of localisation and the emergence of a nonlinear localized state , thus providing a rigorous justification to the behavior conjectured by the effective equation in @xcite .",
    "we employ the constitutive hypothesis of an _ exponential law _ for the viscosity coefficient , @xmath9 the model for the exponential law admits a special class of solutions describing uniform shearing @xmath10 the graph @xmath11 describing the average stress vs. average strain response is monotonically decreasing , and thus the deformation of uniform shear is characterized by strain softening response .",
    "we set the following goals :    1 .   to study the linearized problem around the uniform shearing solution and to assess the effects of the various parameters of the problem 2 .   to inquire whether there are special solutions of the nonlinear problem that indicate the emergence of localized deformations and formation of shear bands .",
    "since the base solution around which we linearize is time - dependent the linearized analysis necessarily involves analysis of non - autonomous systems and also perturbations have to be compared against the base solution .",
    "we perform a linearization using ideas of relative perturbations @xmath12 leading to linearized system @xmath13 with @xmath14 computed by @xmath15 .",
    "this problem turns out to have the following behavior :    1 .",
    "[ en : introa]for the case without thermal diffusion @xmath16 : + when @xmath17 the high frequency modes grow exponentially fast with the exponent of the order of the frequency what is characteristic of ill - posedness and _ hadamard instability_. + when @xmath2 the modes are still unstable but the rate of growth is bounded independently of the frequency .",
    "in fact , the behavior in that range is characteristic of _ turing instability_. 2 .",
    "the effect of thermal diffusion ( @xmath18 ) for the non - autonomous linearized model can also be assessed : perturbations do grow initially in the early stages of deformation , but over time the effect of the diffusion intensifies and eventually the system gets stabilized . for a quantitative description of the above qualitative statement",
    "we refer to lemmas [ lemdecay ] and [ lembound ] .",
    "in addition , this behavior can also occur for the full solution of the nonlinear problem subject to simple shear boundary conditions as indicated in numerical simulations presented in figure [ mtstb ] .",
    "this type of metastable response was already conjectured ( for a somewhat different model ) in numerical experiments of @xcite .",
    "the linearized analysis presented here offers a theoretical explanation of this interesting behavior .    in the second part of this article we consider the adiabatic variant of the model with exponential constitutive law .",
    "the system is expressed for @xmath19 in the form @xmath20 and is now considered on the whole space @xmath21 . for the system , we construct a class of localizing solutions @xmath22 \\sigma ( x , t ) & = \\sigma_s ( t ) \\frac{1}{\\phi_\\lambda ( t ) }   \\ ,   \\sigma_\\lambda \\big ( \\sqrt{\\lambda } x \\phi_\\lambda ( t ) \\big ) , \\\\[2pt ] \\theta(x , t ) & = \\theta_s(t ) + \\lambda \\tfrac{n+1}{\\alpha } ( \\theta_s(t ) - \\theta_0 ) + \\theta_\\lambda \\big ( \\sqrt{\\lambda } x \\phi_\\lambda ( t ) \\big ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 depends on the parameter @xmath24 , and is determined via the solution @xmath25 of the singular initial value problem , with @xmath26 .",
    "the existence of the solution @xmath25 is established in theorem [ connection ] where most importantly its behavior at the origin and at infinity is made precise .",
    "the emerging solution depends on three parameters : @xmath27 linked to the uniform shear in , a parameter @xmath28 which can be viewed as a length scale of initial data , and a parameter @xmath29 determining the size of the initial profile .    to our knowledge",
    "this is the first instance that the compound effect of hadamard instability and parabolic regularizations is mathematically analyzed in a nonlinear context .",
    "the reader should contrast the nonlinear response captured by the exact solution to the response of the associated linearized problem .",
    "the solutions indicate that the competition among hadamard instability and momentum diffusion in a nonlinear context can lead to a nonlinear coherent structure that localizes in a narrow band ( see theorem [ shearband ] and remark [ rmkbeh ] ) .",
    "by contrast , for a linear model , the combined effect of hadamard instability and parabolicity leads to unstable oscillatory modes growing in amplitude ( see ) .",
    "this justifies the scenario that nonlinearity can kill the oscillations caused by hadamard instability so that the non - uniformity of deformation produced by the instability merges into a single localized zone",
    ". it would be interesting to explore this type of response for other models related to material instability in solid mechanics .",
    "the exposition is organized as follows : section [ secdescription ] presents a description of the problem and the formulation via relative perturbations .",
    "the linearized analysis is presented in section [ stabar ] , first the part that can be done via spectral analysis for autonomous systems , and then the part concerning the effect of thermal diffusion , which is based on energy estimates for a non - autonomous linear system .",
    "detailed asymptotics for the eigenvalues and the connection with hadamard and turing instabilities are presented there .",
    "the presentation of the localized solutions is split in sections [ seclocal]-[seclocalii ] : section [ seclocal ] presents the invariance properties , the _ ansatz _ of localized solutions , and also introduces the relevant auxiliary problem , .",
    "the construction of solutions to the singular initial - value problem , and the proof of their properties is the centerpiece of our analysis and forms the objective of section [ secss ] .",
    "the construction is based on a series of steps , involving desingularization , a nonlinear transformation , and eventually the existence of a heteroclinic orbit via the poincar - bendixson theorem .",
    "the construction of the localized solutions is then effected in section [ seclocalii ] .",
    "in this work we study the onset of localization and formation of shear bands for the model describing shear motions of a non - newtonian fluid with viscosity @xmath30 decreasing with temperature . for concreteness",
    "we take a viscosity satisfying the exponential law and are interested in the range where the rate sensitivity @xmath31 is positive and small .",
    "the model then becomes @xmath32 and describes shear motions between two parallel plates located at @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 the velocity in the shear direction , @xmath36 the shear stress , @xmath37 the temperature , and @xmath38 depicting the strain rate .",
    "the boundary conditions are taken @xmath39 equation reflects prescribed velocities at the boundaries , while manifests that the bounding plates are adiabatic .",
    "note that implies that the stress satisfies @xmath40 and that @xmath41 the initial conditions are @xmath42 throughout the study we will consider two cases : when @xmath43 the process is adiabatic and the resulting model will be the main object of study , as it is the simplest model proposed for studying the phenomenon of formation of shear bands .",
    "the case @xmath18 will also be studied in section [ stabar ] as a paradigm to assess the effect of thermal diffusion .",
    "the problem , , admits a class of special solutions describing uniform shear @xmath44 for the special case of the exponential law , @xmath45 and @xmath46 read @xmath47 these are universal solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ they hold for all values of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 in the model including the limiting elliptic initial value problem when @xmath50 , @xmath43 . the graph @xmath51 is viewed as describing the stress vs. average strain response . as the graph is decreasing ,",
    "it means that there is always softening response in the course of the deformation .",
    "the system has served as a paradigm for the mathematical study of the phenomenon of shear bands ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) occurring during the high strain - rate deformations of metals .",
    "formation of shear bands is a well known material instability that usually leads to rupture , and has received considerable attention in the mechanics literature ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a description of the problem intended for a mathematically oriented reader that is briefly also outlined below .",
    "it was recognized by zener and hollomon @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the effect of the deformation speed is twofold : ( a ) to change the deformation conditions from isothermal to nearly adiabatic ; under nearly adiabatic conditions the combined effect of thermal softening and strain hardening tends to produce net softening response .",
    "( b ) strain rate has an effect _ per se _ and induces momentum diffusion that needs to be included in the constitutive modeling . a theory of thermoviscoplasticity is commonly used to model shear bands and we refer to @xcite for various accounts of the modeling aspects .",
    "the basic mechanism for localization is encoded in the behavior of the following simple system of differential equations @xmath52 ( which is the adiabatic case @xmath43 of ) .",
    "this model is appropriate for a non - newtonian fluid with temperature dependent viscosity , and is also a simplification of the models proposed in @xcite to capture the mechanism for shear band formation in high strain - rate plastic deformations of metals .",
    "the argument - adapted to the language of a temperature dependent fluid - goes as follows : as the fluid gets sheared the dissipation produces heat and elevates the temperature of the fluid",
    ". the viscosity decreases with the elevation of the temperature and the fluid becomes softer and easier to shear .",
    "one eventuality is that the shear deformation distributes uniformly across the material in the same manner as it does for the usual newtonian fluids .",
    "this arrangement is described by the uniform shearing solution .",
    "a second mode of response is suggested when comparing the behavior of the fluid in two spots : one hot and one cold .",
    "since the viscosity is weaker in the hot spot and stronger in the cold spots , the amount of shear generated in the hot spot will be larger than the shear generated in the cold spot and in turn the temperature difference will be intensified .",
    "it is then conceivable that the deformation localizes into a narrow band where the material is considerably hotter ( and weaker ) than the surrounding environment .",
    "the two possibilities are depicted in fig .",
    "[ shearflow ] .",
    "the outcome of the competition of thermal softening and momentum diffusion is captured by the behavior of solutions to .",
    "a series of works analyze the system mostly for power law viscosities @xmath53 these studies show stable response @xcite when @xmath54 , and indicate unstable response @xcite but without characterizing the behavior in the complementary region @xmath55 .",
    "more precisely , in the unstable regime tzavaras @xcite shows that development of shear bands can be induced by stress boundary conditions leading to finite - time blow - up , and that their occurrence is associated with a collapse of stress diffusion across the band . on the other hand , bertsch , peletier and verduyn - lunel",
    "@xcite show that if the problem has global solutions and there is a sufficiently large initial temperature perturbation , then a shear band appears as the asymptotic in time state . careful and detailed numerical investigations @xcite",
    "indicate that instability is widespread in the parameter regime @xmath55 and is typically followed by the development of shear bands .",
    "the behavior in the  instability domain \" is at present poorly understood , especially regarding the precise mechanism of formation of the shear band .",
    "the reason is the response in this regime results from the competition between an ill - posed problem and a parabolic regularization , and little mathematical theory is available to study such effects .",
    "nevertheless , an asymptotic theory similar to the chapman - enskog expansion is used by katsaounis - tzavaras @xcite to calculate an effective equation for the compound effect of thermal softening and strain - rate sensitivity .",
    "the effective equation changes type from forward to backward parabolic across the instability threshold , and thus provides an asymptotic criterion for the onset of localization . in the present work",
    ", we will develop a mathematical framework for studying the competition and for examining the conjecture of @xcite .",
    "our analysis is facilitated by the use of the exponential law inducing special scaling properties on the resulting system of partial differential equations .      in the mechanics literature shear localization",
    "is typically associated with hadamard - instability .",
    "this is easily put on display for , by considering the limiting case @xmath50 and @xmath43 . in the parlance of mechanics",
    ", this corresponds to rate - insensitive deformations and absence of heat conduction , and leads to the system of conservation laws @xmath56 for @xmath57 the wave speeds are both imaginary , @xmath58 , and the linearized initial value problem for is ill - posed .",
    "two questions then emerge :    1 .   to assess the combined effect of the competition between hadamard instability and momentum diffusion and/or heat conduction ( as manifested by small @xmath2 and @xmath18 respectively ) .",
    "while hadamard instability indicates the catastrophic growth of oscillations around a mean state , it does not by itself explain the formation of coherent structures typically observed in localization .",
    "the latter is an outcome of the nonlinear effects and has to be assessed at the level of the nonlinear problem .",
    "the first objective is to develop quantitative criteria for the stability of the uniform shearing solutions .",
    "since the basic solutions are time dependent an issue arises how to define their stability .",
    "following @xcite , we call the uniform shearing solution _ asymptotically stable _ if perturbations of the solution decay faster than the basic solution , and we call it _ unstable _ if they grow faster than the uniform shearing solution",
    ".    it is expedient to introduce a relative perturbation formulation of the problem : for the _ exponential law _ , we introduce the state @xmath59 describing the relative perturbation and defined through the transformation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is given by and satisfies in particular that @xmath62 using and we derive the system satisfied by the relative perturbation @xmath59 in the form @xmath63 \\theta_t - \\kappa \\theta_{xx } & = \\sigma_s ( t )    \\ , \\big ( \\sigma \\ , u -1   \\big ) , \\\\[2pt ] \\sigma & = e^{-\\alpha \\theta } u^n .",

    "in this section we present an analysis of the linearized system . since the uniform shearing solution is time - dependent the linearized analysis will seek to classify the precise growth in - time of perturbations .",
