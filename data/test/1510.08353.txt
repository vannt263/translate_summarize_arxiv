    "the physical mechanisms to set the mass ratios of binary stars is of fundamental astrophysical importance , since more than half of main - sequence , pre - main sequence , and even protostars having masses comparable to the sun are members of binary systems @xcite .",
    "binary stars with the primary masses comparable to the solar mass exhibit a wide , essentially flat distribution of the mass ratios ( @xmath12 ) from @xmath130.1 to 1 @xcite .",
    "the physical processes to reproduce such a flat distribution of the binary mass ratios are , however , still controversial .",
    "protostellar binary systems , precursors of main - sequence binary systems , are often surrounded by disks of molecular gas and dusts , `` circumbinary disks '' ( hereafter cbds ) @xcite .",
    "the radii of these cbds range from @xmath9100 to @xmath7500 au , and these cbds often show inner emission depressions and ringlike structures .",
    "mass accretion from these cbds onto the central protostellar binaries has been considered as one of the key physical processes to set the binary mass ratios .",
    "recent high - resolution observations of the cbds have indeed detected gas flows from cbds to the inner protostellar binaries , while the spatial resolutions are not high enough to disentangle the accretions onto the primaries and secondaries @xcite .",
    "theoretically , bate & bonnell ( 1997 ) and bate ( 2000 ) have shown that from their smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations the majority of circumbinary materials accrete onto the secondary .",
    "high - resolution grid - based simulations by ochi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hanawa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown the opposite results , that is , the primary accretes more than the secondary .",
    "ochi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hanawa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argued that high - resolution simulations to sufficiently resolve the gas motions near the l2 and l3 lagrangian points are essential to properly trace the mass accretion , since accreting gas flows into the binary through these lagrangian points . on the other hand",
    ", latest sph simulations have demonstrated that mass accretion in cbds is a function of gas temperatures , and in the case of the high temperature the primary accretes more than the secondary , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "young et al . ( 2015 ) argued that the difference between the above results can simply be explained by the difference of the adopted gas temperatures in the models .",
    "it has been still controversial to construct a consistent , unified model of mass accretion from cbds onto protostellar binaries .",
    "cbds in protostellar binary systems are considered to be embedded in larger - scale protostellar envelopes , which can replenish the central cbds with fresh materials @xcite .",
    "since the observed masses of cbds around protostellar binaries ( @xmath90.1 @xmath14 ) are much smaller than the masses of the central protostellar binaries @xcite , further supply of materials from the protostellar envelopes to the cbds is essential to significantly change the mass and mass ratios of the protostellar binaries .",
    "if a protostellar envelope keeps supplying materials to the central cbd , further growth of the mass and the mass ratio of the protostellar binary will be expected . on the other hand ,",
    "if the most of the envelope materials are being dissipated , the present mass and mass ratio of the protostellar binary will be close to the final values .",
    "such dissipations of protostellar envelopes through the interactions with the associated outflows or stellar winds have been investigated observationally @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to physics of accretion from cbds onto the protostellar binaries , mass replenishment from the surrounding protostellar envelopes , and the connection between protostellar envelopes and cbds , must be taken into account .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on a protostellar envelope harboring the protostellar binary system l1551 ne .",
    "l1551 ne is a young class i protostellar binary ( @xmath15=91 k , @xmath16=4.2 @xmath17 ; froebrich 2005 ) located to @xmath72@xmath185 northeast of another , brightest protostellar binary l1551 irs 5 in the l1551 region @xcite .",
    "the protostellar binary consists of the northwestern source named `` source a '' , and the southeastern source `` source b '' , with the projected separation of @xmath770 au at a position angle of 300@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "our previous sma observations of l1551 ne have identified a @xmath6300 au scale cbd in keplerian rotation with a central stellar mass of 0.8 @xmath14 @xcite , plus a possible outer infalling component @xcite .",
    "our subsequent alma cycle 0 observation of l1551 ne @xcite , at a spatial resolution that is @xmath71.6 times higher ( in beam area ) and a sensitivity that is @xmath76 times better ( in brightness temperature ) than those attained in our previous sma observations , unveiled substructures of the cbd in the 0.9-mm dust - continuum emission .",
    "the revealed substructures are consistent with our 3-d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic simulation @xcite for the presence of two spiral arms driven by gravitational torques from the central binary system .",
    "the alma data of l1551 ne in the c@xmath0o ( 32 ) line also exhibits the deviations from the keplerian motion in the cbd , consistent with our amr simulation that gravitational torques impart angular momentum along the spiral arms ( driving material outwards ) and extract angular momentum between the spiral arms ( driving infall ) . our theoretical model which reproduces the observed features of the cbd around l1551 ne predicts that secondary accretes more than the primary . since our series of the sma and alma observations of l1551",
    "ne have revealed the cbd + protostellar binary system , the next question is the connection from the protostellar envelope to the cbd , and the mass replenishment from the envelope to the cbd .",
    "we conducted single - dish mapping observations of the protostellar envelope surrounding the protostellar binary system of l1551 ne in the c@xmath0o ( @xmath1=32 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath1=32 ) , cs ( @xmath1=76 ) , and the so ( @xmath3=7@xmath46@xmath5 ) lines with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) 10-m telescope .",
    "the aste mapping data in the c@xmath0o line are combined with our previous sma data in the same line , which have a larger field of view and a shorter spacing than those of the alma data and thus more suitable to study the connection between the extended protostellar envelope and the cbd . in this paper",

    "note that the centroid velocity of the envelope component is offset by @xmath7 - 0.2 km s@xmath8 from that of the cbd , and in our model this offset of the centroid velocity is incorporated .",

    "our aste mapping observations of the l1551 ne region have revealed three distinct gas components ; @xmath51 , env , red1 , and red2 .",
    "env is the component of the protostellar envelope surrounding the protostellar binary system l1551 ne , and exhibits the dispersing gas motion as discussed above .",
    "red1 and 2 are most likely the redshifted outflow components driven from l1551 irs 5 , which are interacting with env .    to discuss the interaction between env and red1 and 2 quantitatively ,",
    "physical parameters of these components were estimated as follows .",
    "first , the moment 0 map of each component was made in the relevant tracers and the velocity ranges listed in table [ comphys ] . as shown above ,",
    "env is most clearly identified in the c@xmath0o ( 32 ) emission , and red2 in the @xmath2co ( 32 ) emission .",
    "we adopt the cs ( 76 ) emission to deduce the physical condition of red1 , because in the cs emission red1 can be identified as a distinct gas component most easily , and the submillimeter cs emission must trace higher - temperature gas associated with outflows .",
    "we also note that it is not straightforward to separate red2 in the 3-dimensional space from the other lower - velocity components .",
    "we here identified red2 as the @xmath2co emission component in the highest redshifted velocity range of 9.47  12.53 km s@xmath8 , since in this velocity range red2 is a distinct , highest redshifted component seen primarily in the @xmath2co emission . after making the moment 0 maps of these distinct components , two - dimensional gaussian fittings to the moment",
    "0 maps were performed to derive the central positions , beam - deconvolved sizes along the major and minor axes , and the total flux . for env a single two - dimensional gaussian fitting to the moment 0",
    "map did not provide a satisfactory fit .",
    "thus , for env two - component , two - dimensional gaussian fitting was performed , and the position was defined as the peak position of the central gaussian component , while the size was defined as the size of the outer gaussian component .",
    "the line widths of these components ( @xmath52 ) were derived from the fwhm values of the relevant spectra toward the central positions . projected flow velocities of red1 and red2 , @xmath53 , were defined as the mean velocity at the center of the components with respect to the velocity of env (= 6.7 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "masses of the components ( @xmath54 ) were derived from the total fluxes , on the assumption of the lte condition , optically - thin emission , and the molecular abundances of @xmath55 = 1.7 @xmath34 10@xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 = 7.7 @xcite , and @xmath58 = 6.8 @xmath34 10@xmath59 @xcite . since the peak brightness temperature ( @xmath60 ) of the c@xmath0o emission toward the protobinary position exceeds @xmath613.4 k",
    ", the excitation temperature ( @xmath62 ) must exceed @xmath109.0 k as @xmath63 must be higher than @xmath64 . on the other hand , to excite the submillimeter cs ( 76 ) emission a gas temperature as high as @xmath760 k is required @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath65 = 10 - 60 k is assumed as a probable range of @xmath65 .",
    "virial masses of the components ( @xmath66 ) were derived as ; @xmath67 where @xmath68 in the above expressions @xmath69 denotes the geometrical mean of the sizes along the major and minor axes of the components , and @xmath70 the effective sound speed of gas .",
    "the isotropic velocity dispersion inside the components is assumed . for red1 and 2 , the sizes ( @xmath74000 au ) are as small as the beam size ( @xmath73200 au ) , and thus the line widths derived from the central spectra represent the average velocity dispersions . for env ,",
    "there is no discernible spatial variation of the c@xmath0o line width as shown in the p - v diagrams ( figures [ collipv ] , [ astepvs ] ) , except for that arising from the central disk .",
    "thus , the assumption of the isotropic velocity dispersion inside these components is probably valid .",
    "momenta ( @xmath71 ) , internal gas energies ( @xmath72 ) , and kinetic energies ( @xmath73 ) of the components were derived as ;    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    table [ comphys ] summarizes these derived physical parameters .",
    "the size ( @xmath720000 au ) and lte mass ( @xmath71 - 3 @xmath14 ) of env are typical of protostellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "the virial mass of env is comparable to or slightly larger than the lte mass plus the central protobinary mass . from the comparison between the virial and lte masses it is not straightforward to ascertain whether env is gravitational bound or not . on the other hand",
    ", the identification of the dispersing gas motion in env implies that env is gravitationally unbound .",
    "the outflow components of red1 and 2 are characterized with their compact sizes ( @xmath94000 au ) and wide line widths ( @xmath712 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the lte masses of the outflow components are likely lower than the corresponding virial masses , although for red1 only the upper limit of the virial mass is obtained .",
    "these results indicate that red1 and 2 are not gravitationally - bound gas condensations , consistent with our interpretation that red1 and 2 are outflowing gas components driven from l1551 irs 5 .",
    "the summed flow momentum of red1 and 2 is comparable to that of the momentum of the dispersing motion in env .",
    "furthermore , the net internal+kinetic energy of these outflow components is also comparable to the internal+kinetic gas energy of env .",
    "these results imply that red1 and 2 can exert significant dynamical impacts on env , and can induce the observed dispersing gas motion of env through the interactions .",
    "our new aste observations and combining the aste data with our previous sma data in l1551 ne have revealed that the protostellar envelope around the keplerian cbd is being dispersed .",
    "the dispersing envelope does not show any rotating gas motion in contrast with the keplerian rotation in the cbd , and the centroid velocity of the envelope is @xmath70.2 km s@xmath8 blueshifted with respect to that of cbd .",
    "these results indicate that the protostellar envelope is kinematically distinct from the central cbd .",
    "the outflow components from l1551 irs 5 , as seen most prominently in the submillimeter cs ( 76 ) line ( red1 ) and the high - velocity redshifted @xmath2co ( 32 ) line ( red2 ) , appear to collide and interact with the protostellar envelope .",
    "the net momentum , and kinetic and internal energy of these outflow components are comparable to those of env , suggesting that the outflow collisions can enforce significant dynamical impacts on the envelope . a natural interpretation of these results is that the protostellar envelope in l1551 ne is being disrupted through the interaction with the outflows driven from l1551 irs 5 .",
    "figure [ scheme ] ( bottom ) shows a schematic , inferred configuration of the l1551 region viewed from the north , in parallel with the scuba 850 @xmath77 dust - continuum image @xcite as a representative projected image onto the sky plane ( top ) . in the scuba image a torus - like continuum feature",
    "connecting the envelopes around l1551 irs 5 and ne is seen as delineated with a dashed green curve .",
    "this feature is drawn schematically in the bottom as the northernmost feature .",
    "since the envelope around l1551 ne is being collided with the redshifted outflow components driven from l1551 irs 5 ( red1 and 2 ) , the location of l1551 ne must be backward with respect to the location of l1551 irs 5 along the line of sight .",
    "as already described the western side of the flattened envelope around l1551 ne is far - side and the eastern side near - side .",
    "thus the blueshifted emission to the east and the redshifted emission to the west are interpreted as the dispersing gas motion in the flattened envelope .",
    "our aste single - dish observations of the @xmath2co ( 32 ) , c@xmath0o ( 32 ) , cs ( 76 ) , and so ( 7@xmath46@xmath5 ) lines , as well as sma and alma observations of the @xmath2co ( 32 ) and c@xmath0o ( 32 ) lines @xcite , do not find any evidence for molecular outflows driven from l1551 ne itself .",
    "on the other hand , previous nir observations of l1551 ne found collimated [ fe ii ] jets driven from source a as well as a reflection nebula with its apex close to the position of source b @xcite .",
    "molecular outflows driven from l1551 ne have also been reported in the @xmath35co ( 32 ; 21 ; 10 ) lines @xcite , although it is not straightforward to disentangle the outflows from l1551 irs 5 and ne because of the close overlaps of the two outflows .",
    "our aste observations show that interactions with the powerful l1551 irs 5 outflows have greater impact on the disruption of the envelope than the outflow driven from l1551 ne itself .",
    "this is in contrast with previous findings of interactions between protostellar envelopes and outflows or stellar winds driven from the sources embedded in the envelopes @xcite .",
    "yokogawa et al . ( 2003 ) have suggested that the interactions with the outflows driven from l1551 irs 5 triggered the star formation in l1551 ne .",
    "we consider , however , that the formation of the protostellar binary system l1551 ne has initiated before the arrival of the irs 5 outflows , because at present the protostellar envelope is kinematically distinct and thus physically detached from the cbd and the protostellar binary system .",
    "the similar binary masses ( @xmath70.8 @xmath14 in l1551 ne and @xmath70.5 @xmath14 in irs 5 ) , envelope masses ( @xmath71 @xmath14 ) , and the bolometric temperatures ( @xmath15 @xmath790 k ) indicate that both l1551 irs 5 and ne were born at a similar age .",
    "after their birth both l1551 ne and irs 5 grow simultaneously . the angular separation between l1551 irs 5 and ne is @xmath72@xmath185 , and assuming the transverse velocity of the outflows driven from l1551 irs 5 is @xmath710 km s@xmath8 @xcite , the transverse time for the irs 5 outflow to reach the l1551 ne location is @xmath710@xmath78 yr .",
    "this time scale is approximately consistent with the estimated age of l1551 ne of 0.65.0@xmath3410@xmath78 yr @xcite .",
    "after the outflows from l1551 irs 5 have arrived at the protostellar envelope around l1551 ne , the outflows start disrupting the envelope through the interactions . the possible infalling motion in the inner envelope found with the sma may be a remnant gas motion before the initiation of the interactions with the irs 5 outflows .",
    "such a remnant infalling gas motion embedded in the dispersing envelope has also been identified in a t - tauri star dg tauri @xcite .",
    "the envelope dispersion via the interactions with the irs 5 outflows will impact the final fates of the protostellar binary system of l1551 ne significantly , as will be discussed in the next subsection .      binary stars with the primary masses comparable to that of the sun show a wide range of the binary mass ratios , and the distribution of the mass ratio ( @xmath12 ) is essentially flat from @xmath130.1 to 1 @xcite .",
    "physical mechanisms to reproduce such a wide range of binary mass ratios have been controversial , and gas accretion in the cbds onto the protostellar binaries has been discussed as a mechanism to set the final binary mass ratios . smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations of circumbinary accretion show that the majority of materials accrete onto the secondary , because the secondary orbits further from the center of mass of the binary and thus sweeps more materials in the cbd than the primary @xcite .",
    "our 3-d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic simulation @xcite to reproduce the alma results of the cbd in l1551 ne also shows that the secondary ( source b ) accretes more than the primary ( source a ) @xcite . on the other hand , high - resolution grid - based simulations by ochi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hanawa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that primaries accrete more than secondaries .",
    "latest sph simulations demonstrate that flows from the secondary to the primary within the roche lobes are a sensitive function of gas temperatures , and in the case of the high temperature the primary accretes more than the secondary , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "our aste observations of an archetypal protostellar binary l1551 ne imply that dispersion of protostellar envelopes , which replenish cbds with fresh materials , also needs to be taken into account as a physical mechanism to set the binary masses and the ratios .",
    "the present masses of sources a and b in l1551 ne are estimated to be @xmath70.67 @xmath14 and @xmath70.13 @xmath14 , respectively , and the mass of the cbd @xmath70.026",
    "@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the mass of the possible infalling component around the cbd is even smaller ( @xmath70.0023 @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , even if all the amount of the material in the cbd plus the infalling component is accreted onto source b , the mass ratio does not change much ( from 0.19 to 0.24 ) .",
    "replenishment of the material to the cbd from the surrounding envelope is required to significantly change the mass and the mass ratio of the protostellar binary system .",
    "our aste observations show that the envelope is being dispersed , however , and that further replenishment of materials from the envelope to the cbd will not be expected",
    ". therefore , even though l1551 ne is a class i protostellar binary associated with the cbd and the protostellar envelope , the mass and the mass ratio have been already close to the final values . physical processes before the start of the envelope dispersion through the interaction with the outflow driven from l1551 irs 5 , such as the fragmentation of the initial pseudo - disk and subsequent accretion from the cbd and the envelope , must be responsible to set the mass and mass ratio of the binary system .",
    "our aste observations of l1551 ne indicate that dispersion of natal envelopes surrounding the protostellar binary systems is one of the key physical phenomena to stop the growth of the binary and to determine the final masses and the mass ratios of the binary .",
    "as described in the last subsection , interactions between protostellar envelopes and outflows , which causes the envelope dissipation , are ubiquitous .",
    "systematic studies of envelope dispersion surrounding the protostellar binaries with various masses and mass ratios will be intriguing to understand the physical mechanism to set the final binary mass ratios and the origin of the wide range of the binary mass ratios .",
    "we have conducted single - dish mapping observations of dense gas around an archetypal protostellar binary l1551 ne in the c@xmath0o ( @xmath1=32 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath1=32 ) , cs ( @xmath1=76 ) , and the so ( @xmath3=7@xmath46@xmath5 ) lines with aste .",
    "we have also combined the aste mapping data in the c@xmath0o line with the interferometric data taken with the sma .",
    "the main results are summarized below :    * all the four molecular lines are detected toward the protostellar position , with multiple and/or non - gaussian spectral shapes .",
    "in particular , the c@xmath0o spectrum consists of a narrow ( @xmath790.7 km s@xmath8 ) component with a central velocity of @xmath806.7 km s@xmath8 and a wide ( @xmath792.2 km s@xmath8 ) component with a central velocity of @xmath806.9 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the wide component originates from the compact circumbinary disk ( cbd ) , while the narrow component from the extended protostellar envelope . *",
    "the c@xmath0o map in l1551 ne primarily traces a @xmath720000-au scale protostellar envelope ( env ) , elongated along the northwest to southeast direction , approximately parallel to the major axis of the central cbd .",
    "velocity channel maps of the c@xmath0o line show that the blueshifted ( @xmath806.26.7 km s@xmath8 ) emission is located to the northeast while the redshifted emission ( @xmath806.7 8.0 km s@xmath8 ) to the southwest ; @xmath51 , a velocity gradient of env along the minor axis , while there is no detectable velocity gradient along the major axis .",
    "the observed velocity gradient in env can be interpreted as a dispersing gas motion .",
    "velocity channel maps of the high - velocity redshifted ( @xmath818.0 km s@xmath8 ) @xmath2co emission show two @xmath94000-au scale redshifted components to the @xmath740@xmath11 southwest of the central protostar ( red1 ) and @xmath720@xmath11 west ( red2 ) .",
    "the submillimeter cs ( 76 ) emission selectively traces red1 , suggesting high - temperature in this high - velocity component .",
    "both red1 and red2 exhibit similar velocity gradients such that the velocities become closer to the systemic velocity of env as the positions become closer to that of env .",
    "these high - velocity redshifted components most likely trace the outflow components driven from the neighboring protostellar source , l1551 irs 5 , which are colliding with env surrounding l1551 ne . *",
    "the combined aste+sma map in the c@xmath0o emission shows that the @xmath6300 au scale cbd and @xmath6700 au scale infalling component found in our previous sma observations are surrounded by env with a slightly blueshifted velocity ( @xmath70.2 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "env does not show any rotational motion but dispersing gas motion with an outward velocity of @xmath70.3 km s@xmath8 in contrast to the inner gas components .",
    "these results indicate that env is kinematically distinct from the inner gas components .",
    "* the net momentum , kinetic and internal energies of the redshifted outflow components driven from l1551 irs 5 are comparable to those of env , suggesting that the outflow collisions can enforce significant dynamical impacts on env .",
    "thus , the dispersing motion in env is likely caused by the interactions with the outflows driven from l1551 irs 5 .",
    "* since env is being dispersed and the inner gas components do not have sufficient materials to alter the mass and mass ratio of the protostellar binary of l1551 ne , the current mass ( @xmath70.8 @xmath14 ) and the mass ratio ( @xmath70.19 ) are close to the final values , even though l1551 ne is a young class i protostellar binary .",
    "our aste+sma observations of l1551 ne suggest that dispersion of natal protostellar envelopes which can replenish the cbds with new materials is one of the important physical mechanisms to set the final binary mass ratios .",
    "the interactions with the outflows from l1551 irs 5 are unlikely to trigger the binary formation in l1551 ne as suggested by previous studies , but suppress the further growth of the protostellar binary system .",

    "<S> we performed mapping observations of the class i protostellar binary system l1551 ne in the c@xmath0o ( @xmath1=32 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath1=32 ) , cs ( @xmath1=76 ) , and so ( @xmath3=7@xmath46@xmath5 ) lines with atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) . the aste c@xmath0o data are combined with our previous sma c@xmath0o data , which show a @xmath6300-au scale keplerian disk around the protostellar binary system . </S>",
    "<S> the c@xmath0o maps show a @xmath720000-au scale protostellar envelope surrounding the central keplerian circumbinary disk . </S>",
    "<S> the envelope exhibits a northeast ( blue ) - southwest ( red ) velocity gradient along the minor axis , which can be interpreted as a dispersing gas motion with an outward velocity of 0.3 km s@xmath8 , while no rotational motion in the envelope is seen . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the envelope , two @xmath94000 au scale , high - velocity ( @xmath101.3 km s@xmath8 ) redshifted @xmath2co and cs emission components are found to @xmath740@xmath11 southwest and @xmath720@xmath11 west of the protostellar binary . </S>",
    "<S> these redshifted components are most likely outflow components driven from the neighboring protostellar source l1551 irs 5 , and are colliding with the envelope in l1551 ne . the net momentum , kinetic and internal energies of the l1551 irs 5 outflow components are comparable to those of the l1551 ne envelope , and the interactions between the outflows and the envelope are likely to cause the dissipation of the envelope and thus suppression of the further growth of the mass and mass ratio of the central protostellar binary in l1551 ne . </S>"
