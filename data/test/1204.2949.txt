    "the main difference is that the solutions obtained here is topological trivial whereas the kink is topological non - trivial solution .",
    "the topological non - triviality means that there exists an integer ( a topological charge ) that does not change by a small deviation of the solution .",
    "usually the topological charge is characterized by the solution behavior at the infinity .",
    "let us emphasize once again that the solutions obtained here are topological trivial and they exist because the corresponding potential has both local and global minima only .",
    "now we would like to discuss the physical interpretation of the obtained solutions .",
    "the interpretation strongly depends on the asymptotic value of the energy densities . in the case of non - zero value",
    "we have the space filled with one bose - einstein condensate @xmath31 and on the background of this condensate there is a spherically symmetric defect ( cavity ) filled with another bose - einstein condensate @xmath32 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of both condensates is different : for @xmath31 condensate the asymptotic value is non - zero but for @xmath32 condensate the asymptotic value is zero . the same is valid for both energy densities .",

    "one can mention that similar solution have been found for a scalar model of a glueball @xcite . in this model",
    "the lagrangian from su(3 ) gauge theory by some manner can be approximated by a lagrangian with two scalar fields .",
    "these two scalar fields approximately describe 2-@xmath0 and 4-@xmath0 green functions ( i.e. the correlation between fields in two or four points in the spacetime ) of su(3 ) gauge fields .",
    "the first scalar field describes a gauge field belonging to subgroup @xmath72 and the second scalar field describes fields belonging to a coset @xmath73 .",
    "the kinetic terms from the initial lagrangian gives rise to kinetic terms for both scalar fields .",
    "the terms like @xmath74 give rise to terms like @xmath75 in corresponding potentials for the scalar fields @xmath76 @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 is the su(3 ) gauge potential .",
    "the difference between the potential and the potential obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the potential is the polynomial of 6-@xmath0 order whereas the potential from @xcite is polynomial of 4-@xmath0 order .",
    "but in both cases corresponding potentials have local and global minima that leads to the existence of a regular solution . in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar construction is considered and following conclusion is made ``  a dilute fermi - dirac droplet will behave very much like a nuclear system . ''    finishing the comparison of obtained here solution with the solution obtained for the scalar model of a glueball we see that there is clear analogy between both solutions .",
    "it allows us to draw interesting and useful analogy between physical objects from high energy physics and bec s physics : ( a ) the defect solution is similar to a cavity on the background of the space filled with a nonzero gluon condensate ; ( b ) the droplet solution is similar to a glueball .",
    "another important feature of the solution obtained here is following : in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that under certain conditions , the system of two bec s has an almost degenerate ground state which is separated from the excited levels by an energy gap .",
    "the atomic ensemble then behaves like a two - level system that could be used to encode a qubit .",
    "the authors have offered the idea of using these two many - body states to encode a qubit and use it for quantum computation .",
    "one can use the defect / droplet obtained here as an elementary element ( quantum gate ) for creating the qubit device offered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally we would like to list the main features of the solutions obtained here :    * the presented defect / droplet solutions exist for two interacting bec s only . *",
    "the solutions exist for special choice of the bec s potential : it should have local and global minimum only .",
    "* the solutions are eigenfunctions for nonlinear differential equations .",
    "consequently some physical parameters must have a well defined values ( external potential , coefficients in front of @xmath79body scattering terms and so on ) . *",
    "the droplet solution without any external trapping potential exists in the case of very strong interaction between atoms of bec only . the droplet solution presented here",
    "does exist if there is a positive four - body scattering term of atoms for one bec .",
    "* the defect solution exists for the standard potential of two interacting bec s but with some special choice external trapping potentials .",
