    "quantum open systems have been a subject of fundamental interest for many years .",
    "problems in this category include those of understanding how the irreversibility of time appears in system dynamics , why macroscopic systems can be treated with classical mechanics instead of quantum mechanics , how wave functions collapse as a result of measurements done with macroscopic instruments , and why and how quantum systems approach a thermal equilibrium state through interaction with their environments.@xcite theories of quantum open systems have also been used to construct models of practical interest , in particular to account for line shapes in epr , nmr@xcite and laser spectra,@xcite to evaluate chemical reaction rates@xcite and electron and charge transfer rates@xcite in chemical physics , and to explore the lifetimes of quantum entanglement states in quantum information theory.@xcite    the phenomena mentioned above arise from the unavoidable interaction of a system with its environment . in the quantum mechanical case ,",
    "dissipative systems are often modeled as main systems coupled to heat - bath degrees of freedom at finite temperature .",
    "this coupling gives rise to thermal fluctuations and dissipation that drive the systems toward the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the heat - bath degrees of freedom are then reduced using such methods as the projection operator method and the path integral method .",
    "the projection operator approach is effective if the interaction between the system and the bath is weak .",
    "if one further assumes that the correlation time of the noise arising from the interaction with the bath is very short ( the markovian assumption ) , equations of motion for the density matrix elements can be derived , and these can be solved numerically .",
    "the most commonly used equations of this kind are the quantum master equations@xcite and the redfield equation.@xcite it has been proven , however , that quantum master equations and the redfield equation do not satisfy the necessary positivity condition.@xcite careful analyses addressing this problem have been carried out by several researchers.@xcite as a method to preserve positivity , the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , which modifies the interaction between the system and the heat bath , has been applied.@xcite however , this may alter the thermal equilibrium state as well as the dynamics of the original total hamiltonian . then , building on these results , it was shown that the violation of the positivity condition results from the markovian assumption . specifically , it was found that even if the dissipation process is markovian , the fluctuation process may not be , because it must satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem.@xcite    the time convolution - less ( tcl ) master equation has a wider range of applicability than the quantum master equations and redfield equation , because it allows the system - bath interaction to be non - perturbative and fluctuation and dissipation to be non - markovian.@xcite in order for a non - perturbative treatment to be possible , however , the system hamiltonian and the bath interactions of the tcl equation must commute.@xcite thus , the tcl equation can not be used to treat many important problems involving molecules , atoms , and spins driven by a time - dependent laser or magnetic field .",
    "in addition , because of the factorized nature of the system - bath interaction , in the case of a non - commuting excitation , the tcl equation can not be used to calculate nonlinear response functions of the system operator involved in the optical multidimensional spectrum.@xcite    path integral monte carlo simulations do not have the limitations of any of the approaches discussed above , and for this reason , they are capable of incorporating imaginary path integrals and unfactorized initial conditions more easily , but this approach is computationally heavy , because the number of paths to be evaluated grows rapidly with time , while sampling fails due to the phase cancellation of wave functions.@xcite much effort has been made to extend the applicability of this method.@xcite because this approach can easily incorporate the semi - classical approximation in the bath , it may have an advantage in the study of polyatomic systems treated in multi - dimensional coordinates , but applications to this point incorporating full quantum dynamics have been limited to relatively small systems .",
    "many of the above - mentioned limitations can be overcome with the hierarchal equations of motion ( heom ) for the reduced density matrix , which are derived by differentiating the reduced density matrix elements defined by path integrals.@xcite this approach was introduced to investigate the connection between the phenomenological stochastic liouville equation and the dynamical hamiltonian theory , and was originally limited to the case in which the spectral distribution function takes the drude form ( i.e. , the ohmic form with a lorentzian cutoff ) and the bath temperature is high.@xcite however , with the inclusion of low temperature corrections terms , this temperature limitation has been eliminated.@xcite in addition , with the extension of the dimension of the hierarchy , this approach is capable of treating a great variety of spectral distribution functions.@xcite this formalism is valuable because it can treat not only strong system - bath coupling but also quantum coherence between the system and bath , which is essential to calculate nonlinear response functions . the system - bath coherence becomes particularly important if the bath interaction is regarded as non - markovian , as was found from nonlinear optical measurements in the late 1980s , when laser technology reached the femto - second time scale , which is much shorter than the noise correlation time of environmental molecules.@xcite the heom approach has been used to study such problems , which include multi - dimensional spectroscopy.@xcite recently , it was shown that system - bath coherence also plays an important role in calculations of quantum measures involving concurrence@xcite and non - markovianity@xcite under multiple external perturbations.@xcite    because the heom approach is computationally heavy , a variety of methods have been developed to study dissipative dynamics in realistic situations .",
    "@xcite it has been applied to the study of multi - dimensional vibrational spectroscopies,@xcite photosynthetic antenna systems,@xcite fermion systems , @xcite quantum ratchets,@xcite resonant tunneling diodes,@xcite and dissociation of tightly bounded electron - hole pairs.@xcite    while the applicability of the heom approach continues to expand , the basic nature of the hierarchy elements has not been thoroughly explored .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of correlated initial equilibrium states in the heom formalism . until this time",
    ", the heom have been derived by assuming a factorized initial state , @xmath0 \\exp[-\\beta \\hat h_b]$ ] , at inverse temperature @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the system and bath hamiltonians , respectively , while the true thermal equilibrium state of the system is given by @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the system - bath interaction .",
    "the difference between the factorized and correlated initial states becomes large for strong @xmath5 .",
    "analysis based on an analytic solution of a brownian oscillator system indicates that even if we start from a factorized initial state , the system reaches the true equilibrium state , @xmath6\\}$ ] , through transient phenomena arising from the factorized initial state , for example phenomena known as initial sweeping.@xcite with the heom approach , we have run the heom program until all of the hierarchy elements reach the steady state and then used these elements as the initial conditions of the correlated thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the accuracy of this method has been confirmed by analyzing multi - dimensional spectra obtained with it.@xcite nevertheless , it would be interesting to derive the heom starting from a correlated initial thermal state in order to obtain an analytically derived expression for the system - bath coherence in the heom formalism .",
    "moreover , with a simple generalization , we can also derive the heom in imaginary time , which corresponds to the inverse temperature .",
    "we show that the imaginary - time heom is convenient for obtaining correlated thermal equilibrium states and the thermodynamic variables of the reduced system .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec . ii we present a model hamiltonian and its influence functional with correlated initial states . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the heom from the density matrix elements using the influence functional formalism with the correlated initial states given in sec .",
    "ii . in sec . iv , we derive the imaginary - time heom , which is convenient for evaluating correlated thermal equilibrium states and the thermodynamic quantities of the system . in sec .",
    "v , to confirm the validity and numerical efficiency of our approach , we report the results of numerical integrations of the heom carried out over real time and imaginary time for a spin - boson system and compare their results .",
    "thermodynamic variables and expectation values for the spin - boson system are also calculated as a demonstration .",
    "section vi is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a situation in which the system interacts with a heat bath that gives rise to dissipation and fluctuation in the system . to illustrate this , let us consider a hamiltonian expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the system , denoted by a , defined by the creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
