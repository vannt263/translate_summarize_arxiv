    "adic , or bratteli - vershik ( bv ) , systems represent all measure - preserving systems on nonatomic probability spaces and all minimal systems on the cantor set . they provide a convenient combinatorial description of the construction of systems by the cutting and stacking method , present tail fields of stochastic processes as the fields of adic - invariant sets , facilitate the study of measure - preserving and topological orbit equivalence , and present important and interesting particular systems for detailed study .",
    "we refer to the introductions of the papers in our references list and the survey @xcite for background and further details .",
    "for adic systems , invariant measures and orbit equivalence depend only on the graph - theoretic structure of the underlying diagram and are independent of the orders assigned to the edges entering each vertex , which determine the adic transformation ; further dynamical properties , such as the spectrum , isomorphism , or joinings , do depend on the particular ordering .",
    "some recent work has investigated how the orderings assigned to the edges can affect the sets of maximal and minimal paths .",
    "bezuglyi , kwiatkowski , and yassawi @xcite studied arbitrary reorderings of adic systems to determine which ones  the  perfect \" orderings  allow the adic transformation to be defined as a homeomorphism .",
    "they showed that when orderings of a diagram of finite rank @xmath1 are chosen uniformly at random , there is a @xmath2 such that almost every ordering has @xmath3 maximal and @xmath3 minimal paths .",
    "medynets @xcite gave an example of a diagram for which no ordering is perfect .",
    "bezuglyi and yassawi @xcite pursue this question beyond the finite rank case and give necessary and sufficient conditions for a diagram to admit a perfect ordering .",
    "janssen , quas , and yassawi @xcite produce a class of systems for which @xmath4 and almost every ordering is imperfect .",
    "it is important to determine when coding the orbits of paths according to the natural partition into cylinder sets determined by the first @xmath0 edges produces an essentially faithful representation of the system as a subshift on a finite alphabet ; for then traditional methods of symbolic dynamics can be applied , and , even if the adic transformation can not be defined as a homeomorphism , nevertheless the corresponding subshift can be studied as a legitimate dynamical system . by ",
    "essential \" we mean that the coding map is one - to - one except on a set of paths that has measure zero for each fully supported adic - invariant probability measure on the system .",
    "this property was proved for the pascal adic with a particular edge ordering ( namely one that is lexicographical from left to right at each vertex ) in @xcite and for a wider class of systems in @xcite . on the other hand , downarowicz and maass @xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that each minimal finite topological rank adic system , namely one that can be represented up to topological conjugacy by an adic system with a bounded number of vertices on each level , with unique maximal and minimal paths , and having all orbits dense , either has a faithful coding by the first @xmath0 edges for some @xmath0 or else is topologically conjugate to an odometer .",
    "this result may be regarded as a generalization of previous work ( see @xcite ) on the relations among stationary adic systems , substitutions , and odometers .",
    "it was extended to aperiodic cantor minimal systems in @xcite .",
    "so far we have been lacking useful tests for when a general adic system allows an essentially faithful representation as a subshift or when it is topologically conjugate to an odometer . here",
    "we show ( theorem [ thm : coding ] ) that for the pascal system every edge ordering allows essentially faithful coding by the first three edges .",
    "further , extending the ideas in @xcite , we show that for every ordering the subshift defined by the coding is topologically weakly mixing ( theorem [ thm : weakmixing ] ) .",
    "we find this somewhat surprising , since the existence of eigenfunctions is highly sensitive to timing .",
    "we also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for an adic system of a fairly general kind to be topologically conjugate to an odometer ( theorem [ uoimpliesodometer ] ) .",
    "( previously , sufficient conditions were known for systems with a bounded number of vertices per level @xcite .",
    "a similar condition has been given independently by durand and yassawi @xcite , and a necessary condition was mentioned in @xcite . )",
    "we use this condition to determine the probability that a random order on a fixed diagram , or an ordered diagram constructed at random in a certain sense , is topologically conjugate to an odometer ( examples [ ex : odometerprob ] and [ ex : odometer2 ] ) .",
    "we also study the subshift that is the closure of the union of the subshifts determined by the pascal adic with all possible orderings : we estimate its complexity , prove that it is not topologically transitive , and show that its only periodic points are the two fixed points . on the other hand ,",
    "the intersection over all orderings consists of just four orbits .",
