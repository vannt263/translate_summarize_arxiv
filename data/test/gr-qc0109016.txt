    "the concept of an apparent horizon is very important to understand the global feature of spacetimes because the formation of an apparent horizon implies the existence of an event horizon outside of it , and a black hole has formed .",
    "hence it is of great interest to investigate the condition for the apparent horizon formation .",
    "but the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an apparent horizon is not precisely understood so far .",
    "although one theorem that gives a sufficient condition for the apparent horizon formation was proved by schoen and yau  @xcite , it can not be applicable to vacuum spaces , and it does not give a necessary condition .",
    "as one possibility to give a necessary and sufficient condition for the black hole formation , there is the hoop conjecture  @xcite .",
    "the conjecture states that for a spacelike hypersurface @xmath0 , a black hole horizon exists if and only if the mass @xmath1 of the system gets compacted into the interior of a closed surface s whose circumference ( hoop ) @xmath2 satisfies the condition @xmath3 its physical meaning is that the mass concentration in all direction is essential for the formation of a horizon , and the ratio @xmath4 is a parameter to judge the horizon formation .",
    "it is meaningful to confirm the hoop conjecture not only because it is interesting theoretically , but also it can be a useful tool to test the formation of a black hole in numerical simulations .",
    "if we want to know whether a black hole has formed , we must solve a differential equation that determines the location of apparent horizons .",
    "if the hoop conjecture is correct , we can judge the black hole formation by calculating the hoop @xmath2 and the mass @xmath1 and then taking their ratio . therefore the hoop conjecture has a possibility to give an easier method to judge the black hole formation .",
    "several tests of the hoop conjecture has been done by various authors .",
    "shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite calculated the gravitational collapse of collisionless gas spheroids numerically .",
    "they found that when a naked singularity appears , the ratio @xmath4 becomes greater than @xmath5 and when an apparent horizon forms , @xmath4 takes a value close to @xmath5 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated an analytic series of the initial data for momentarily static dust spheroids .",
    "their result shows that there does not exist a critical value @xmath4 that gives both the necessary and the sufficient condition for the apparent horizon formation .",
    "nevertheless , they indicated that there exist two characteristic values of @xmath4 ; the larger one gives the necessary condition and the smaller one gives the sufficient condition for the horizon formation .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath4 can still be a useful parameter for the apparent horizon formation .",
    "other tests with momentarily static initial data also show @xmath4 is a parameter for the horizon formation  @xcite , and they support the hoop conjecture .    in this paper , we concentrate on the test of the hoop conjecture using initial data of einstein s equation .",
    "although there are several tests of the hoop conjecture , its validity for non - time - symmetric initial data has not been systematically investigated .",
    "we pay attention to the effect of the motion of gravitational bodies on the apparent horizon formation .",
    "we prepare the initial data of colliding black holes with equal mass and equal linear momentum .",
    "we use the solution obtained by bowen and york  @xcite .",
    "the initial data depends on two parameters : one is a separation @xmath6 of two black holes and the other is a momentum @xmath7 of each black hole . in the momentarily static case",
    ", it is well known that the decrease of the separation @xmath6 of two black holes causes the formation of an apparent horizon that envelopes both black holes .",
    "it is this horizon that we concentrate on in this paper .",
    "we search the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 that lead to the formation of an apparent horizon .    in testing the hoop conjecture",
    ", we must specify the definition of the circumference @xmath2 and the mass @xmath1 . as the circumference @xmath2 of the hoop , chiba _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has proposed the appropriate definition for all @xmath8 surfaces . as the definition of the mass @xmath1",
    ", the adm mass is adopted usually  @xcite .",
    "but intuitively , the formation of an apparent horizon occurs if the mass @xmath1 of the system is concentrated in a sufficiently small region .",
    "the adm mass represents the total energy of the system and we expect that @xmath4 given by the adm mass becomes a good parameter to judge the horizon formation only if the energy of the system is well concentrated in a region enclosed by a some compact surface s on which the circumference @xmath2 is evaluated",
    ". when a lot of energy is distributed outside the surface s , the adm mass does not give a correct gravitational mass contained interior of the surface s and is not suitable for testing the hoop conjecture .    actually , if the adm mass is used , we have some examples that @xmath4 is not a good parameter for the horizon formation .",
    "one example is a charged star  @xcite , for which @xmath4 can take a value close to @xmath9 even if an apparent horizon does not exist .",
    "flanagan  @xcite suggested that one should use `` quasi - local mass '' that extract gravitational energy contained interior of a closed surface , because the energy of electric field distributes outside the surface of a star .",
    "in fact , if we use quasi - local mass , we can show that @xmath4 becomes larger than unity for such an equilibrium star . as one can not uniquely",
    "determine the local energy in general relativity , there are many definitions of quasi - local mass .",
    "we do not know what quasi - local mass is best for the hoop conjecture . in the case of a charged star ,",
    "the definitions of the quasi - local mass due to hawking  @xcite and penrose  @xcite give better results than the adm mass .",
    "another example is the brill wave spacetime  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the gravitational energy can not be localized so much .",
    "if we consider the brill wave with large width , @xmath4 given by the adm mass can not be a good parameter to judge the horizon formation  @xcite .",
    "these two examples indicates that @xmath4 given by the quasi - local mass becomes a good parameter to judge the horizon formation .",
    "for the bowen - york initial data , jansen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed that this space is not a pure black hole system .",
    "they calculated the mass and the scalar invariants of the bowen - york initial data and compared them with those of the boosted schwarzschild black hole initial data .",
    "their result shows that the bowen - york initial data for the moving black hole system contains a junk gravitational field at large distances from black holes .",
    "hence , we expect that @xmath4 with the quasi - local mass can be a better parameter than @xmath4 with the adm mass .    in this paper ,",
    "we calculate @xmath4 using two different definition of the mass : the adm mass and the quasi - local mass . as the quasi - local mass",
    ", we use hawking s quasi - local mass  @xcite because for spherically symmetric spaces , @xmath4 given by the hawking mass has a critical value @xmath10 for the horizon formation ; if @xmath11 , there exists a horizon and if @xmath12 , there is no apparent horizon .",
    "thus @xmath4 given by the hawking mass is a critical parameter for the horizon formation as far as the spherically symmetric cases are concerned . for",
    "axially symmetric cases , we expect that this desirable feature of the hawking mass will hold .",
    "even there is no critical value , we regard @xmath4 as a parameter to judge the horizon formation if there exist two values @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; for @xmath15 , an apparent horizon exists and for @xmath16 , an apparent horizon does not exist .",
    "once @xmath4 are obtained as functions of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we can define two regions in the parameter space @xmath17 : @xmath18 we compare the regions @xmath19 for the adm mass with those for the hawking mass .",
    "if @xmath20 , we can say that @xmath4 with the hawking mass is better than @xmath4 with the adm mass because the former predict wider range of the initial data parameter on the existence of the apparent horizon .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we explain the method of our analysis of the two black hole initial data . in section iii",
