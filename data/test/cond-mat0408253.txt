    "recent years have seen a rapid increase in the interest in finite quantum spin systems , also known as molecular magnets or nanomagnets @xcite .",
    "molecular magnets typically consist of clusters of interacting spins that are magnetically isolated from the other clusters in the molecular solid by nonmagnetic ligands .",
    "formally , molecular magnets are materials in which the ground state has nonzero total spin . here",
    "we generalize this definition to include all systems of largely isolated clusters of interacting quantum spins .",
    "these materials are interesting both as simple model systems for the study of quantum magnetism and because they have possible applications as nanoscale computer memory elements @xcite .",
    "many realizations of finite spin clusters with various ionic spins , ground state spins and geometries have been reported in the literature ; some recent examples with s=1/2 ions are given in table  [ materials ] .",
    "theoretical results for the properties of finite s=1/2 quantum spin systems have appeared in several recent references , primarily in the context of experimental studies of specific materials .",
    "dimer results are reported in several studies of the s=1/2 spin dimer vo(hpo@xmath0)@xmath10.5h@xmath2o ; see for example johnson _",

    "theoretical properties of s=1/2 spin trimers have similarly been given in studies of candidate trimer materials ; see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "rather few general theoretical results have been reported for s=1/2 spin tetramers , since the results are more complicated and there are many more independent geometries and sets of superexchanges .",

    "waldmann @xcite has carried out calcuations of the inelastic neutron structure factor for cyclic heisenberg spin clusters which are quite similar to the results presented here .",
    "this increased level of interest in molecular magnets motivates more detailed theoretical investigation of the properties of finite quantum spin systems . for simple theoretical models such as the heisenberg model ,",
    "clusters that consist of only a few interacting magnetic ions can be treated analytically , and closed - form results can be obtained for many physical observables .",
    "one especially interesting quantity is the inelastic neutron scattering structure factor , which is required for the interpretation of inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering is very well suited to the investigation of magnetic interactions at interatomic scales , since the measured structure factor is sensitive to the local geometry and interactions of the magnetic ions . as this work",
    "is intended in part to facilitate future neutron scattering studies , the evaluation of this structure factor is one of our principal concerns ."
