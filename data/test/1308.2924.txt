    "neutrons are an important background for underground experiments studying neutrino oscillation , dark matter , neutrinoless double beta decay and the like .",
    "majority of the neutron background is created by the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) interaction , where the @xmath0 particles come from the decays of radioisotopes in the vicinity .",
    "neutrons can also be created by interactions of cosmic - ray muons with matter in the underground laboratories .",
    "contrary to neutrons coming from ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , these spallation neutrons have a very broad energy distribution that extends to gev .",
    "they can travel a long distance from the production vertices , and penetrate into the detector without being vetoed . as a result",
    ", they may be captured after thermalization , or interact with the detector materials to create fake signals .    since the spallation process is very complicated , it is highly desirable to investigate experimentally the production properties of the muon - induced spallation neutrons in underground environments .",
    "such studies have been carried out in several underground experiments at different depths , ranging from 20 m.w.e . to 5,200 m.w.e .",
    "the lack of experimental information also compromises the validity of simulation on spallation neutron .",
    "the goal of the aberdeen tunnel experiment in hong kong is to study the production of spallation neutrons by cosmic - ray muons at a vertical depth of 235 m of rock ( 611 m.w.e . ) using a tracking detector for tagging the incoming muons and a neutron detector filled with a liquid scintillator loaded with gadolinium ( gd ) for detecting the spallation neutrons . in this paper",
    ", we present the details of the aberdeen tunnel experiment in section 2 .",
    "we will describe the design and construction features of the muon tracker and the neutron detector . in section 3 ,",
    "calibration of the hodoscopes on the muon tracker and pmts in the neutron detector will be discussed .",
    "the energy scale calibration of the neutron detector will be described .",
    "data acquisition and trigger formation of the detectors will be presented . in section 4 , details of simulations and detector performance will be given .",
    "the underground laboratory ( at 22.23@xmath2n and 114.6@xmath2e ) was constructed inside the aberdeen tunnel in hong kong island in the early 1980s .",
    "the tunnel is a two - tube vehicle tunnel of 1.9-km long .",
    "it lies beneath the saddle - shape valley between two hills of over 400 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1_topo_map_2 ] ) , namely mount cameron on the west and mount nicholson on the east .",
    "the saddle - shape terrain provides a rock overburden of 611 m.w.e . for the laboratory which is located at the mid - point of the tunnel .",
    "it has dimensions of 6.7 m ( l ) @xmath3 3.2 m ( w ) @xmath3 2.2 m ( h ) .",
    "the entrance is in a cross passage connecting the two traffic tubes .",
    "access of the laboratory is only possible when all the traffic are diverted to one of the tubes during tunnel maintenance from 00:00 hr to 05:00 hr , typically two to four times a week .",
    "the major types of rock covering the aberdeen tunnel are granite and vitric tuff ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2_topo_map_3 ] ) . in order to find out their chemical composition ,",
    "rock samples were collected on the surface near the aberdeen tunnel for analysis .",

    "[ fig:2_topo_map_3 ] .",
    "samples of suitable size ( from locations 2 , 3 , 7 and 8) were analyzed by x - ray fluorescence spectroscopy ( xrf ) at the university of hong kong .",

    "determination of their physical properties was done at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory @xcite .",

    "the caen sy1527lc high - voltage power supply mainframe and the caen a1535sn high - voltage supply modules are found to be very sensitive to the dusty environment in the aberdeen tunnel laboratory . in about four months of operation , as demonstrated in fig .",
