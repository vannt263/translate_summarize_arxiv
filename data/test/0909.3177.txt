    "sensitive blank - field mm and submm continuum surveys have discovered hundreds of dusty , star - forming submm galaxies ( smgs ) over the past decade ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "determining their redshift distribution has been much slower , however , because the large dust content of smgs means that they often have only weak ( if any ) counterparts in the rest - frame ultraviolet and optical , making spectroscopic redshift determinations extremely difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the poor spatial resolution of mm / submm continuum surveys ( typically 1119@xmath2 ) means that several potential , faint optical / near - ir counterparts exist .",
    "this requires deep radio or _",
    "mid - ir images to pinpoint the most likely counterpart for optical spectroscopic follow - up observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the largest smg redshift survey published so far was based on radio - identified smgs @xcite , which may bias the redshift distribution since radio emission may remain undetected even in the deepest radio maps for sources at @xmath3 .    a promising alternative route to determine the redshift of an smg is through observations of co emission lines at cm or mm wavelengths .",
    "these lines arise from the molecular gas , the fuel for star formation and can thus be related unambiguously to the submm continuum source .",
    "therefore , these observations do not require any additional multi - wavelength identification and circumvent many of the problems inherent to optical spectroscopy of smgs .",
    "the narrow bandwidth of existing mm receivers , however , placed severe limitations on this approach as it was too time - consuming to search blindly for the co lines in redshift space via multiple frequency tunings . in recent years , a lot of effort has been invested in overcoming this bandwidth limitation at various radio facilities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . with the commissioning of the multi - band heterodyne receiver , emir , at the iram 30 m telescope ,",
    "this situation has greatly improved .",
    "emir s 8-ghz instantaneous , dual - polarization bandwidth in the 3-mm band provides the same spectral coverage as alma .",
    "combined with the large collecting area of the 30 m telescope this allows for blind searches for high - redshift co lines at mm wavelengths .    to demonstrate the capabilities of emir as a ` redshift machine ' , we targeted smmj14009 + 0252 .",
    "this source was discovered by the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) in early 1998 and is one of the brightest smgs discovered to date ( @xmath4mjy , * ? ? ?",
    "despite several attempts , and the availability of an accurate radio position , no spectroscopic redshift could be determined  mainly because of its faintness at near - ir / optical wavelengths . in this letter",
    "we report the results of our blind search for co lines in this smg .",
    "the 3-mm ( e090 ) set - up of emir provides 8ghz of instantaneous , dual - polarization bandwidth .",
    "the entire accessible frequency range , @xmath5ghz , can be covered with five tunings .",
    "this corresponds to 0@xmath6@xmath7@xmath60.4 for co(10 ) and 1.0@xmath6@xmath7@xmath68.7 for the co lines between ( @xmath8 ) and ( 76 ) , with only a small gap at 1.78@xmath6@xmath7@xmath61.98 .",
    "the gap can be covered by 2-mm observations , i.e. emir is a powerful instrument to search for high - redshift ( @xmath7@xmath91 ) co emission .",
    "observations were made in july 2009 during average summer conditions ( @xmath107 mm precipitable water vapor ) .",
    "data were recorded using 16 units of the wideband line multiple autocorrelator ( wilma , 1ghz of bandwidth each ) to cover 8ghz in both polarizations .",
    "wilma provides a spectral resolution of 2mhz which corresponds to 5 - 7  for the 3-mm band .",
    "the observations were done in wobbler - switching mode , with a switching frequency of 1hz and an azimuthal wobbler throw of 100@xmath2 . pointing",
    "was checked frequently on the nearby quasar j1226 + 023 and was found to be stable to within @xmath11 .",
    "calibration was done every 12min using the standard hot / cold - load absorber .",
    "the data were processed with the class software .",
    "we omitted scans with distorted baselines and subtracted only linear baselines from individual spectra .",
    "we first scanned the full 3-mm tuning range of emir with @xmath102hr of observing for each tuning .",
    "the tunings were spaced to provide 500mhz overlap .",
    "excellent receiver noise temperatures across the band ( 35 - 45k ) resulted in typical system temperatures of @xmath10100k .",
    "the resulting spectrum had an r.m.s .",
    "noise level of 0.5mk ( @xmath12mjy ) at a velocity resolution of 200but did not show clear evidence for co line emission .",
    "we then increased the integration time for the lower part ( @xmath6105ghz ) of the 3-mm band until we reached an average r.m.s .",
    "noise level of 0.2mk ( 1.2mjy ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum , shown in fig.[3mm - scan ] , shows a line at @xmath1088ghz .    at this stage",
    "the source redshift was still not determined as it was not clear which co transition was detected in the 3-mm scan .",
    "we therefore used the dual - frequency 3-/2-mm ( e090/e150 ) set - up of emir to search for a second co transition in the 2-mm band and to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the 3-mm line . in this configuration",
    ", each frequency band has an instantaneous , dual - polarization bandwidth of 4ghz .",
    "the 2-mm mixers were tuned to 146.5ghz , under the assumption that the 3-mm line was the co(32 ) transition at @xmath13 . at this frequency",
    "the receiver noise temperature was @xmath1030k , yielding a system temperature of @xmath10120k .",
    "smmj14009 + 0252 was observed in the dual - frequency set - up for @xmath105hr and we clearly detected a second line in the 2-mm band ( see fig.[spectra ] ) .",
    "additional 2-mm data were taken in an attempt to observe a third co line in the 1-mm band ( e150/e230 configuration ) . given the relatively poor observing conditions , the 1-mm data did not yield a meaningful limit .    the beam sizes / antenna gains for the line frequencies at 3 and 2 mm are 28@xmath2/6.0jyk@xmath14 and 15@xmath2/6.5jyk@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we estimate the flux density scale to be accurate to @xmath151015% .",

    ".  noise level ( @xmath16 ) for both spectra is 160@xmath17k ( 1.0mjy ) and 180@xmath17k ( 1.3mjy ) at 3 and 2 mm , respectively .",
    "both lines are detected at high significance ( 9 and 12@xmath18 for the integrated intensities ) .",
    "the line profiles for both lines are very similar and well described by a single gaussian with a fwhm of 470 .",
    "the parameters derived from gaussian fits to both line profiles are given in table  [ colines ] .",
    "the frequencies unambiguously identify the lines as co(32 ) and co(54 ) ( see our discussion below ) . combining the centroids of both lines ,",

    "at first glance the observed frequencies can not only be interpreted as co(32 ) and co(54 ) at @xmath13 but also as co(65 ) and co(109 ) at @xmath38 or even co(98 ) and co(1514 ) at @xmath39 .",
    "the co ladder , however , is not equidistant in frequency which results in small , but significant differences for the frequency separation of the line - pairs as a function of rotational quantum number .",

    "the observed co(54 ) to co(32 ) line ratio ( 0.7 ) implies that the co emission is sub - thermally excited , at least for the co(54 ) line .",
    "this line ratio is identical to that observed for smmj16359 + 6612 @xcite and we employ the large velocity gradient models discussed in that paper to estimate a co(10 ) line luminosity of @xmath46kpc@xmath47 .",
    "this translates into a molecular gas mass of @xmath48 using a standard ulirg conversion factor of 0.8(kpc@xmath47)@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these numbers take the lens magnification of @xmath49 due to the foreground cluster , abell 1835 at @xmath50 , into account @xcite .",
    "the large molecular gas mass is in line with estimates based on the dust continuum measurements .",
    "the 1350- , 850- and 450-observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a compilation of the observed flux densities ) can be described by a dust temperature of @xmath51k ( similar to the kinetic temperature of the co model ) and a gas mass of @xmath52 using the dust model in @xcite and a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the implied far - ir luminosity ( integral between 40 - 120 , @xcite ) of this model is @xmath53 which corresponds to a star - formation rate of @xmath54yr@xmath14 .",
    "these numbers classify smmj14009 + 0252 as a ulirg .",
    "we note , however , that this model underestimates the observed 24-  flux density and additional warmer dust components are required to fit the mid - ir data ( see fig.[dustsed ] ) .",
    "such a multi - component dust model predicts @xmath55 , although the lack of data between 24 and 450  means that the shape of the wien tail of the dust sed is not well constrained . in any case",
    "the estimated far - ir luminosity is far ( @xmath56 ) lower than estimates based on the radio / far - ir correlation @xcite which supports the conclusion of @xcite that smmj14009 + 0252 contains a radio - loud active galactic nucleus .",
