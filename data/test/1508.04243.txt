    "we study a scalar - tensor - vector theory which has been introduced as an alternative to particle dark matter @xcite . this theory is referred as mog ( modified gravity ) in the current literature .",
    "mathematically , mog is complicated than gr in the sense that it postulates more gravitational filed than gr .",
    "in fact , mog is a scalar - tensor - vector theory of gravity , while gr is a tensor theory . in other words , in mog in addition to the metric tensor , there are two scalar fields ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and also a massive proca vector field @xmath2 .",
    "in fact the gravitational constant is variable as is in scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "therefore , the existence of these fields will provide some degrees of freedom which may help to handle the dark matter problem without invoking dark matter particles .",
    "it is worth mentioning that adding non - minimal scalar fields to the effective lagrangian of gravitational filed dates back to brans - dicke theory @xcite . in this theory",
    "the non - minimal scalar filed was introduced in order to incorporate the mach s principle into gr . however , there are also other motivations for adding into play the scalar fields . for example ,",
    "non - minimally coupled terms between scalar fields and geometric quantities , such as the ricci scalar @xmath3 , have to be added to the gravitational action when quantum corrections are taken into account .",
    "also scalar - tensor theories show up as the dimensionally reduced effective theories of higher dimensional theories , such as kaluza - klein theory . for a comprehensive review of the subject ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the existence of the vector fields in the gravitational action has its own long story . in vector - tensor theories , in the form of einstein - ather theories @xcite , there is a lorentz - violating vector field .",
    "the existence of this vector field can dramatically affect the cosmology .",
    "for example , it may leave an imprint on perturbations in the early universe @xcite , and it can even affect the growth rate of structure in the universe . also the vector fields are a simple and natural candidates to explain some certain anomalies in the cosmic microwave background @xcite . for another example of theories containing vector fields , one may refer to tensor - vector - scalar theory ( teves ) @xcite .",
    "teves is a relativistic covariant theory for modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite .",
    "teves has both types of above mentioned fields , i.e. scalar and vector fields .",
    "as we mentioned before , mog is also another example of theories where scalar and vector fields participate in the gravitational sector .",
    "this theory has been applied to explain the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and the mass discrepancy in the galaxy clusters @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been claimed that this theory is in excellent agreement with the rotation curve data for the milky way , while mond does not fit the data @xcite .",
    "in fact , the observed rotation curve data for the milky way extends as far as @xmath4 from the center of the galaxy .",
    "data for such a large distances from the core of the galaxy may provide a critical test of modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "there are some papers in the relevant literature which have studied the consequences of mog at the cosmological scale , for example see @xcite-@xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the astrophysical aspects of this theory has been investigated more extensively than its cosmological consequences . for example , there is no exact cosmological solution for this theory in the literature .",
    "this point motivated us to study the cosmological behavior of this theory by looking for exact solutions for the modified friedmann equations .",
    "to do so , we use the _ noether symmetry approach _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , as every conservation theorem , the noether conservation theorem allows to reduce dynamics of the cosmological model and gives insight into conserved quantities .",
    "this approach has been extensively used in various cosmological models and modified theories of gravity , for example see @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the noether symmetry approach is used in non - minimal scalar - tensor theories and in higher order theories of gravity .",
    "also a general review of the noether symmetry approach can be found in this paper . in the current paper ,",
    "i.e. in the context of mog , there is also a non - minimal scalar field .",
    "we shall see that there are some cosmological exact solutions in mog which correspond to some specific solutions presented in @xcite , for example see subsection [ secnew ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that the _ hojman s conservation theorem _ @xcite has also been used to study the dynamics of cosmological models and to find exact cosmological solutions for them @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in section (",
    "[ 2 ] ) , we briefly review mog s field equations and derive the corresponding modified friedmann equations . in section ( [ 3 ] ) , we derive the point - like lagrangian which is needed for applying the noether symmetry approach .",
    "section ( [ 4 ] ) is devoted to the application of the noether conservation theorem to mog . in this section",
    "we find the explicit form of the generic vector field potential by symmetry issues . in section (",
    "[ 5 ] ) , for the first time in the literature , we find some new exact solutions for mog and discuss their cosmological implications .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "we start with the generic action of mog @xmath5+s_m\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the matter action , @xmath7 is the cosmological constant , @xmath8 is a positive coupling constant , @xmath9 , and the scalar fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to those of the original paper @xcite as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "also @xmath14 is the self - interaction potential for the vector field @xmath15 and can be a function of @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "variation of ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 leads to the following field equations respectively @xcite @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the einstein tensor and @xmath24 is a `` fifth force '' matter current defined as @xmath25 nonzero @xmath24 means that there is a coupling between matter and the proca vector field @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , one can verify that the matter energy - momentum tensor is not conserved and the einstein s equivalence principle is violated @xcite . also , the total energy - momentum tensor is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy - momentum tensor for the ordinary matter , and @xmath28 furthermore , we assume a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor for the ordinary matter .",
    "also we consider the cosmological behavior of mog in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe for which the line element is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cosmic scale factor . now , by inserting this metric to the field equations ( [ mog11])-([mog14 ] ) , and also noting the relation between @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , we find the modified version of the friedmann equations . the _ 0 - 0 _ component of ( [ mog11 ] ) gives @xmath33\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the zeroth covariant component of the vector field and @xmath35 is the total energy density of the matter / radiation . also dot denotes the derivative with respect to time .",
    "the terms inside the bracket can be considered as corrections to the corresponding standard friedmann equation . using the equation of motion of the test particles in mog ( the generalized version of the geodesic equation in metric theories )",
    ", one can find an action for a pressure - less dust .",
    "therefore , it can be shown that @xmath36 ( see @xcite for more detail ) . where @xmath37 is another coupling constant .",
    "although it seems that there are two independent coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath37 , they almost always appear as the combination @xmath38 through the calculations of the physical quantities . also it should be mentioned that because of the _ cosmological principle _",
    ", spatial components of @xmath24 and all components of antisymmetric tensor @xmath39 are zero .",
    "furthermore the _ i - i _ components of ( [ mog11 ] ) takes the following form @xmath40\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the pressure of the cosmic fluid , and we have used equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for terms including @xmath42 .",
    "equation ( [ mog12 ] ) , i.e. the field equation of the vector field , takes the following form @xmath43 therefore the potential @xmath14 should satisfy the following general criterion for all values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 furthermore , equation ( [ mog13 ] ) can be written as @xmath47 and finally equation ( [ mog14 ] ) reads @xmath48 if the generic potential @xmath14 and the equation of state @xmath49 are known , then equations ( [ eq1]),([eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) are five non - linear partial differential equations for five unknown functions @xmath30 , @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the vector field is not `` dynamical '' in the sense that its field equation does not contain any time derivative . in other words ,",
    "the vector field is algebraically related to the energy density @xmath35 .",
    "before starting the noether symmetry approach , we consider the vacuum exact solution ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . in this case",
    "the modified friedman equations can be analytically integrated for a wide range of generic potential @xmath14 .",
    "let us rewrite equations ( [ eq1]),([eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , respectively , as @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath59 .",
    "also it should be mentioned that we have assumed that the proca potential has a general form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are arbitrary functions .",
    "@xmath62 satisfies @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that in the absence of matter / radiation the vector field freezes out at a finite value .",
    "we have assumed models for which the vector field freezes at @xmath65 .",
    "this is the case for original potential of mog , i.e. @xmath66 .    the exact solutions to equations ( [ 91])-([92 ] ) are @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants of integration .",
    "one may consider this solution as a late time solution where the energy density of matter and radiation is zero .",
    "if @xmath75 then we have an accelerated expansion , i.e. @xmath76 . in this case",
    "@xmath50 is an increasing function of time and @xmath44 can be decreasing or increasing .",
    "it is important mentioning that this late time acceleration is not a de sitter universe where the cosmic scale factor grows as @xmath77 .",
    "equations ( [ eq1]),([eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) can also be deduced from a canonical point - like lagrangian @xmath78 . for notational simplicity , in this section",
    "we use @xmath11 and @xmath10 instead of @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the point - like lagrangian @xmath79 is derived from action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "we denote the configuration space by @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 is the corresponding tangent space where the lagrangian @xmath79 is defined . on the other hand ,",
    "the euler - lagrange equation of @xmath79 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 can be @xmath84 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "also the energy equation is @xmath85 therefore combining equations ( [ el ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) , we have five equations which make a complete set of partial differential equations for five unknown functions .    in order to find @xmath79",
    "one must insert the flat frw metric into action ( [ action ] ) and simplify the result using an integration by parts .",
    "note that the ricci scalar curvature takes the form @xmath86 . as a result",
    ", one can easily verify that , in a frw manifold , the lagrangian related to the action ( [ action ] ) takes the point - like form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the proper energy density . where @xmath89 is the matter energy density , and @xmath90 is the radiation energy density .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in general , the mater energy - momentum tensor in mog is not conserved ( see equation a31 in @xcite ) .",
    "however in the case of frw universe we have @xmath91 and consequently one can write @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the current values of the corresponding energy densities",
    ". the current magnitude of the cosmic scale factor has been normalized to unity .",
    "it is interesting that although there is a coupling between matter and the vector field , the energy - momentum tensor of the ordinary matter is conserved .",
    "this is an enormous simplification made by the cosmological principle .",
    "now by writing the euler - lagrange equations ( [ el ] ) for the lagrangian ( [ pl ] ) , one can straightforwardly derive the equations ( [ eq2])-([eq5 ] ) . on the other hand , the energy condition ( [ energy ] )",
    "will give the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "now let us introduce the _ lift vector field _",
    "@xmath96 @xcite .",
    "@xmath96 is an infinitesimal generator of the noether symmetry in the tangent space @xmath97 , and is defined as @xmath98 where the functions @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 depend on the configuration space variables @xmath84 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath103 .",
    "one can straightforwardly show that @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the lie derivative of the lagrangian along the lift vector @xmath96 , and @xmath106 is defined as @xmath107 therefor one may conclude that @xmath106 is a conserved quantity if @xmath108 ( this is the noether s theorem ) .",
    "it is needed to recall that in theories which there is no coupling between matter and the gravitational fields , the right hand side of this criterion is zero . by applying this condition to the lagrangian , the analytic form of the functions @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 will be specified .",
    "in fact , one may simply equate to zero the coefficients of terms like @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and so on in order to find some differential equations for the lift vector s components .",
    "this is a common procedure in the relevant literature of the noether symmetry approach , for example see @xcite-@xcite . applying this procedure to the lagrangian ( [ pl ] ) , we find the following differential equations @xmath112 furthermore , there are some terms in @xmath105 which do not contain any time derivatives of configuration space variables",
    ". the summation of these terms should be separately zero : @xmath113 it is obvious from equations ( [ n1 ] ) that the function @xmath102 can be an arbitrary function of @xmath84 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in other words , the existence of the noether symmetry does not restrict the functional form of @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , one can construct infinite number of symmetry generators for this cosmological model .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , there are nine differential equations in ( [ n1 ] ) which are enough for finding the exact form of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 . after finding this functions and inserting them into ( [ n2 ] ) , we shall find the form of the generic potentials @xmath14 for which the noether symmetry exists . after some straightforward algebraic calculations , one can verify that the general solutions to equation ( [ n1 ] ) are @xmath117 where @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are integration constants .",
    "although the lagrangian ( [ pl ] ) seems complicated , it possesses simple noether symmetry generators .",
    "furthermore , using the second equation in ( [ n3 ] ) , the term containing the cosmological constant @xmath7 vanishes in ( [ n2 ] ) . therefore , equation ( [ n2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath121 in order to find the exact form of the potential @xmath14 it is needed to find the scale factor @xmath30 and the scalar field @xmath10 with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath103 .",
    "to do so , let us first derive the conserved quantity @xmath106 associated to the noether symmetry generator @xmath96 .",
    "we recall that noether s theorem states that every symmetry of the lagrangian implies the existence of a conservation law , and therefore a conserved quantity . using the lagrangian ( [ pl ] ) and equation ( [ n5 ] ) , we find @xmath122 for the sake of simplicity we assume that @xmath123 .",
    "thus one can easily verify that when @xmath124 , we have @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a new integration constant .",
    "when @xmath118 is zero ( i.e. when @xmath101 is constant ) , it is easy to show that @xmath127 substituting these results into equation ( [ n4 ] ) , we find @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a constant and is equal to @xmath130 when @xmath124 and @xmath131 when @xmath118 is zero .",
    "it is important to note that , in principle , one may find the cosmic scale factor as a function of @xmath132 from the field equation of the vector field ( i.e. equation ( [ eq3 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ n7 ] ) is a partial differential equation for potential @xmath133 .",
    "this equation will determine the general form of @xmath14 for which the noether symmetry exists .      in this case",
    "the energy budget consists of the cosmological constant @xmath7 , non - relativistic matter , the scalar fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the vector field @xmath15 . equation ( [ n7 ] ) takes a simple form and can be easily integrated .",
    "the result is @xmath136 where @xmath137 is an arbitrary function of @xmath103 , and we have used @xmath138 .",
    "this potential covers a wide range of potentials .",
    "for example the original potential of mog , i.e. @xmath139 @xcite , lies in this subclass .",
    "another , straightforward example is @xmath140 which in an isotropic and homogeneous space - time takes the form @xmath141 . also , it is obvious that if @xmath119=0 ( or equivalently @xmath142 ) then @xmath14 is a function of the vector field and does not depend on the scalar field @xmath32 .",
    "more importantly , every function of @xmath16 is a solution .      in this case , we rewrite equation ( [ n7 ] ) as follows @xmath145 and the general form of the solution is @xmath146 in which @xmath147 , and @xmath148 is an arbitrary function of @xmath149 .",
    "simple examples of this class of potentials , are @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "now we present some new exact cosmological solutions to mog s modified friedmann equations . also we restrict ourselves to solutions with zero radiation density .",
    "we recall that by setting the noether constant of motion @xmath106 to zero , we found equations ( [ co1 ] ) and ( [ co2 ] ) .",
    "let us rewrite these equations as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a constant .",
    "this is a key equation to derive exact solutions . using this equation we find some solutions for specific potentials introduced in the previous sections as potentials for which the noether symmetry exists .      where @xmath156 is a constant .",
    "we have used a new parameter @xmath83 instead of @xmath129 as @xmath157 .",
    "this model corresponds to a scalar - tensor theory with two scalar fields @xmath44 and @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , since the matter and radiation are absent in the model , there is no source for producing the vector field . with the aid of equation ( [ co3 ] ) and assuming a power - law type solutions for the scalar fields as @xmath158 and @xmath159 , we find the following exact solution @xmath160 where @xmath70 is related to other constants as @xmath161 one can easily show that this solution corresponds to an accelerated expansion ( i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath162 ) if @xmath163 or @xmath164 . in this case , the magnitude of the scalar @xmath50 decreases with time and for @xmath44 increases .",
    "this solution has an interesting feature : the model can be contracting ( i.e. @xmath165 ) while @xmath76 .",
    "this situation happens when @xmath166 or @xmath167 . in this case",
    "@xmath44 is a decreasing function of time and @xmath50 is increasing .",
    "in fact the existence of the scalar fields @xmath44 and @xmath50 can lead to repulsive gravitational force in the early universe .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this potential is the original potential postulated in mog @xcite .",
    "for this model we use equation ( [ co3 ] ) and also assume power - law type solution for @xmath50 and @xmath44 .",
    "one can easily verify the following exact solution @xmath171{{\\frac { 544}{9}}\\,{\\frac { \\pi \\,\\alpha_0 g_n { \\rho_{m0 } } } { { {   \\mu_0}}^{2}{}}}}{t}^{{\\frac { 12}{23}}}\\nonumber\\\\ & g(t)={\\frac { 2312}{207}}\\,\\frac{\\alpha_0 g_n } { { { \\mu_0}}^{2 } } { t}^{-{\\frac { 10}{23}}}\\\\ & \\mu(t)= { \\mu_0}{t}^{-{\\frac { 18}{23}}}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\kappa \\phi_0(t)={\\frac { 9}{34}}\\nonumber\\\\&\\rho_m(t)={\\frac { 9}{544}}\\,\\frac{\\mu_0^{2}}{\\pi\\,\\alpha_0 g_n } { t}^{-{\\frac { 36}{23}}}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath172 is one of the free parameters of mog , and @xmath173 is the gravitational constant .",
    "its observational values is @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "one can easily verify that the condition ( [ criterion ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is obvious that the `` velocity '' of the vector field is zero and field s value remains constant in this matter dominated phase .",
    "also this solution corresponds a decelerating universe .",
    "if we compare this solution with the matter dominated universe in gr ( flat frw space time with @xmath53 ) where @xmath175 , then we see that the scale factor increases slower than the standard friedman model .",
    "thus the matter density also decreases with slower rate .      where @xmath177 is a constant .",
    "with the aid of equation ( [ co3 ] ) , one may easily verify the following solution @xmath178 where @xmath179 can has two values : @xmath180 and @xmath181 , and @xmath70 is related to the other constants as @xmath182 it is worth mentioning that the condition ( [ criterion ] ) holds if @xmath183 . as we see",
    "the vector field is again constant . also , the existence of two different values for @xmath179 shows that our power - law type solutions are not the complete and unique solutions to the cosmological field equations .",
    "for @xmath181 the cosmic scale factor increases linearly with time and so without deceleration , i.e. @xmath184 .",
    "therefore scale factor increases faster than the standard matter dominated friedmann model .",
    "also we recall that in gr , for a matter dominated universe with flat spatial curvature and zero cosmological constant , @xmath185 can not vanishes .",
    "for @xmath180 the scale factor increases as @xmath186 .",
    "therefore the scale factor increases faster than the standard case .",
    "however , unlike the case @xmath181 , we have a negative acceleration ( @xmath187 ) . as a final remark for this solution , we mention that the repulsive nature of the theory is again evident . in other words ,",
    "the combination of the scalar fields and the vector field mog can yield a repulsive gravitational force at the cosmological scale .      where @xmath179 and @xmath189 are real constant , and @xmath190 .",
    "therefore this model is different from those presented in the previous subsections .",
    "again , by using equation ( [ co3 ] ) which was obtained from the conserved quantity of the noether symmetry , we find the following solution @xmath191 where @xmath192 corresponding to @xmath193 and the relations between constants are @xmath194 the criterion ( [ criterion ] ) leads to @xmath195 . if we assume that @xmath183 ( note that @xmath50 is related to the gravitational constant ) , then everything is well defined provided that @xmath196 .",
    "it is interesting that this solution represent a constant acceleration for the cosmic expansion .",
    "we mention again that such a behavior is not achievable in the corresponding standard friedmann model .",
    "as it is clear from equations ( [ es4 ] ) , the scalar field @xmath50 is an increasing function of time , and the scalar field @xmath44 depending on the value of parameter @xmath197 can be an increasing function of time or a decreasing one .",
    "however , the rate of expansion is independent of the behavior of @xmath44 .    it is worth mentioning that @xmath31 is a non - minimal scalar field .",
    "as we have already mentioned , non - minimal scalar - tensor theories have been already investigated using the noether symmetry approach , for example see @xcite . although there is an extra vector field in mog which is coupled to matter distribution , there are some similarities between the exact solutions of these theories .",
    "for example the exact solution presented in this subsection is reminiscent of the exact solution presented in equation ( 6.42 ) in @xcite .      in this case",
    ", we found the solution exact solution : @xmath199 where @xmath200 or @xmath201 and @xmath202{\\,{\\frac { { g_0}\\,\\alpha_0 g_n{\\pi } ^{2}{{\\rho_{m0}}}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{\\mu_0}}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the condition ( [ criterion ] ) is satisfied if @xmath203 and @xmath183 .",
    "for @xmath200 the scale factor decreases as @xmath204 , and so @xmath165 and @xmath76 .",
    "however , for @xmath205 the scale factor grows as @xmath206 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the cosmology of a specific scalar - vector - tensor theory of gravity known as mog using a well - known approach .",
    "we have found the noether symmetry generators and also the conserved quantity associated to the symmetry .",
    "more specifically , this approach helped us to find the explicit form of the vector field potential @xmath14 ( see equations ( [ po1 ] ) and ( [ po2 ] ) ) .",
    "we showed that the original potential postulated in this theory , is one of those potentials for which the noether symmetry exists .",
    "also , using the conserved quantity associated to the noether symmetry , we have found some exact solutions for the modified friedmann equations of mog .",
    "we have found five set of exact solutions and except in one of them , we have not neglected the ordinary matter contribution .",
    "more specifically , our solutions correspond to matter dominated universes . as we mentioned before , power - law type exact solutions",
    "are not necessarily unique .",
    "however , these solutions are very often used in cosmological theories in order to insight into the physical content of them . in the context of mog , there are some interesting features in the exact solutions which may help to understand the cosmological behavior of this theory . for example , the existence of the scalar and vector fields in mog can lead to contracting universe with positive acceleration . in other words , these fields effect can behave like repulsive gravitational force at the cosmological scales . also , there exist some solutions which the `` gravitational constant '' ( the scalar field @xmath50 ) increases with time as well as solutions where @xmath50 is decreasing .",
