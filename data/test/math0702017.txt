    "is nature always looking for optimum for living organisms ?",
    "in particular , are the organs designed to optimize some criterion ?",
    "complete answers to these questions are likely never to be discovered .",
    "nevertheless , assuming that nature proceeds in the most efficient way , can lead to a better understanding of the modeling of an organ and the underlying physical or chemical phenomena .",
    "this is this idea of _ inverse modeling _ that we had in mind when we began this work . roughly speaking",
    ", it can be described by the following steps :    1 .",
    "let us consider a given organ of a living body .",
    "2 .   write a mathematical model which describes the behavior of this organ .",
    "3 .   imagine a ( numerical ) criterion that nature would like to optimize for this organ .",
    "4 .   determine the optimal shape for this criterion and this model .",
    "compare with the real shape(s ) .",
    "if the optimal and the real shapes coincide , we can guess that our model and our criterion are relevant . if they do not",
    ", we must admit that either our criterion or our model ( or the initial guess that nature looks for optimum ) is probably wrong .",
    "we believe that it will often be the choice of the criterion which is not correct .",
    "a possible reason is the complexity of nature .",
    "this complexity indicates that , in general , there is not a unique criterion to optimize but several ones ( which could also be antagonists ) .",
    "the mathematical study ( point 4 in the above procedure ) becomes then much more difficult since one needs to use tools of multi - criteria optimization .    in this paper , we want to follow the above procedure in the case of a dendrite .",
    "we consider a fiber which is sealed at its right end and connected to a soma at its left end .",
    "we use the classical cable equation to describe the electrical potential along the fiber .",
    "what are the criterions that we can consider here ?",
    "of course , we want the dendrite to propagate the best as possible the electrical signal . in other terms",
    ", the attenuation of the signal must be as small as possible .",
    "we are going to consider the two kinds of possible attenuation : * attenuation in time or in space * and we are looking for the shape of a dendrite which minimizes this attenuation . in both cases ,",
    "the optimal shape that we get is a cylinder .",
    "since it is very close to the real shape , at first sight , we can conclude that nature is in accordance with mathematics for this problem and solves a shape optimization problem ! for a general reference in mathematical modeling in neuroscience , we refer to the book of a. scott , @xcite . for a more exhaustive view and an introduction to the beauty of shapes ( and , in particular , optimal shapes ) in nature",
    ", we refer to the classical books of s. hildebrandt and a. tromba , @xcite and a. bejan , @xcite .",
    "let us consider a fiber with a cylindrical symmetry , of length @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 at point @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the difference from rest of the membrane potential at point @xmath2 and time @xmath4 .",
    "the equation satisfied by @xmath3 is similar to the classical cable equation as established by w. rall during the sixties , cf @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "see also , @xcite as the best motivation of the current study .",
    "we consider here the case of a fiber which is sealed at its right end and connected to a soma with surface area @xmath5 at its left end .",
    "let us denote by @xmath6 the axial resistance ( k@xmath7 cm ) , @xmath8 is the membrane capacitance ( @xmath9f/@xmath10 ) , @xmath11 the fiber membrane conductance and @xmath12 the soma membrane conductance ( ms/@xmath10 ) .",
    "we assume that the fiber is initially at rest and that it receives a transient current stimulus @xmath13 at the left .",
    "the parabolic equation satisfied by @xmath14 is then ( see @xcite ) : @xmath15 it is convenient to represent @xmath14 , solution of ( [ 1 ] ) , in terms of eigenfunctions as did s. cox and j. raol in @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18-th eigenfunction associated to the eigenvalue @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is assumed to be non negative .",
    "we choose to normalize the eigenfunctions by @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "of course the eigen - pair @xmath24 strongly depends on the taper @xmath1 so we will often denote it by @xmath25 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ 2 ] ) is not classical since the eigenvalue appears in the boundary condition , see section [ timeattenuation ] for more precisions .",
    "inserting the decomposition ( [ decompsoma ] ) in the equation ( [ 1 ] ) gives an ordinary differential equation satisfied by @xmath26 .",
    "after resolution , we get : @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( see lemma [ lemmasign ] ) and @xmath29 denotes the convolution product of distributions .",
    "we need now to give a precise statement to the optimization problems presented in the introduction . in that purpose",
    ", we have to choose the functions we want to optimize and the class of functions @xmath1 in competition .",
    "let us begin with this last point .",
    "since the fiber must not collapse , it is natural to assume a lower bound for the functions @xmath1 , so we fix a positive constant @xmath30 and we impose : @xmath31,\\quad a(x)\\geq a_0>0\\,.\\ ] ] now the minimal regularity needed for @xmath32 is clearly , according to system ( [ 1 ] ) or ( [ 2 ] ) that the derivative @xmath33 exists ( at least almost everywhere ) and is bounded , so we choose to work in the class of lipschitz continuous functions which is often denoted by @xmath34 . at last",
    ", we also need to put a constraint on the `` cost '' for nature to build a fiber .",
    "it seems reasonable to consider that this cost is proportional to the surface area of the fiber .",
    "this surface area is clearly given by @xmath35 so we can assume a bound , say @xmath36 , on this surface area . to summarize , we consider the class of functions @xmath1 defined by : @xmath37 of course , we need to assume @xmath38 in order that the class @xmath39 be non trivial .    as explained in the introduction , an `` ideal '' dendrite should conduct in the best possible way the electrical information he is supposed to transmit . in other terms , the attenuation of the signal must be minimized .",
    "since the potential @xmath14 depends on the space and the time variable , we can consider both criterions .",
    "let us introduce the transfer function @xmath40 defined by : @xmath41 @xmath42 corresponds to the ratio of the mean values in time of the potential @xmath14 taken at points @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this ratio is always greater than one , see remark [ rem24 ] and is a good indicator of the attenuation of the signal between the two extremities of the dendrite .",
    "so , it is realistic to look for a taper @xmath1 which yields a ratio as close to one as possible : @xmath45      according to expansion ( [ soluv ] ) , the potential @xmath3 goes to 0 when @xmath46 .",
    "more precisely , its asymptotic behavior is described by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the first eigenvalue of ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , as it is classical in such parabolic problems , it seems natural to look for a function @xmath1 which minimizes the exponential rate of decay : @xmath50 the idea of minimizing eigenvalues of such sturm - liouville operators is a long story and goes back at least to m. krein in @xcite , see also @xcite for a review on such problems .",
    "we state in the following theorem the main results of this paper    [ maintheo ]    1 .",
    "the unique minimizer of the eigenvalue @xmath51 in the class @xmath52 is the constant function @xmath53 .",
    "the unique minimizer of the criterion @xmath54 in the class @xmath52 is the constant function @xmath53 .",
    "in other terms , for both criterions , the optimal shape of a dendrite sealed at one end and connected to a soma at the other end is the cylindrical one !    in his thesis and in a foregoing paper , see @xcite , @xcite , the second author studies the case of a dendrite sealed at both ends . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", it changes the boundary conditions in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) which become homogeneous neumann boundary conditions at both extremities .",
    "the result he obtains is the same for the case of attenuation in space , but it is different for the attenuation in time . actually , there is no existence of a minimizer for @xmath49 ( as usual in the neumann case @xmath55 and @xmath49 denotes the first non - zero eigenvalue ) .",
    "moreover , he is able to exhibit minimizing sequences which would produce very strange dendrites !",

    "as explained in @xcite , see also the works of j. walter @xcite and j. ercolano - m .",
    "schechter @xcite , a good way to handle with such case consists in introducing the following inner product : @xmath60 its associated norm @xmath61 and the hilbert space @xmath62 defined as the completion of the space of continuous functions @xmath63)$ ] for this norm .",

    "2nd step : :    we use the change of variable defined by    @xmath91 to transform    the equation satisfied by @xmath92 into a simpler    differential equation .",

    "4th step : :    we conclude .",
    "the parabolic equation is not completely standard in the sense that it contains a dynamical boundary condition at @xmath43 .",

    "<S> what is the optimal shape of a dendrite ? </S>",
    "<S> of course , optimality refers to some particular criterion . in this paper , we look at the case of a dendrite sealed at one end and connected at the other end to a soma . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical potential in the fiber follows the classical cable equations as established by w. rall . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the shape of the dendrite which minimizes either the attenuation in time of the potential or the attenuation in space . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the cylindrical shape is optimal . </S>"
