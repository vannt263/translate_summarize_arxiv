    "these models are one of the classes discovered by gowdy @xcite as a reinterpretation of einstein - rosen waves @xcite .",
    "while their plane symmetry precludes local mixmaster behavior , their nonlinear gravitational wave interactions lead to an interesting phenomenology which forms the subject of this paper .",
    "the gowdy singularity has been conjectured to be asymptotically velocity term dominated ( avtd ) @xcite and has been shown rigorously to be so for the polarized case @xcite .",

    "this should be considered together with the asymptotic expansion developed by grubisi and moncrief ( gm ) @xcite which displays an exponential decay to the avtd limit , applicable in the last episode .",
    "the primary advantage of the gowdy models as a test case for the study of inhomogeneous cosmologies is the existence of variables in which the dynamical equations for the wave amplitudes decouple from the constraints .",

    "we see that the approach to the avtd regime is characterized by repeated alternate interactions of @xmath5 with the two potentials .",

    "examination of ( [ qequations ] ) shows that , when @xmath177 falls below unity and @xmath39 , @xmath179 as required by the avtd limit .",

    "this becomes even more dramatic in fig .",
    "[ qminusp ] which is the same graph for @xmath181 , the site of the apparent discontinuity in @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the magnitude and time evolution of @xmath135 and @xmath144 as well as the initial values of the wave amplitude time derivatives are different at different values of @xmath11 .",
    "this explains the development of complicated small scale spatial structure . from ( [ k1eq ] ) or ( [ k2eq ] ) , one computes the time to the first bounce off @xmath135 or @xmath144 as @xmath182 where @xmath183 or @xmath184 and @xmath185 at @xmath186 .",
    "here @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "evaluation of ( [ k1eq ] ) and ( [ k2eq ] ) at @xmath189 yields an approximate inverse scaling with @xmath102 seen in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "the central peak appears first and is easy to understand . since , initially , @xmath190 , the highest negative velocity occurs at @xmath191 causing the bounce off @xmath135 to occur there first .",
    "@xmath5 then begins to increase at @xmath191 both earlier and faster than at neighboring values of @xmath11 .",
    "more complicated is the next pair of peaks which occur near @xmath192 .",
    "initially , the profile of @xmath5 vs @xmath11 steepens .",
    "however , bounces off @xmath144 will begin to occur .",
    "this causes the tangent to @xmath5 vs @xmath11 to evolve from negative ( positive ) to positive ( negative ) slope for @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) eventually creating a pair of peaks .",
    "the higher the original value of @xmath102 , the greater will be the number of bounces before @xmath144 disappears for good .",
    "ever finer small scale structures are created at @xmath11 values where many bounces occur since @xmath5 will increase for some spatial regions and decrease for others in a manner that changes with time .",
    "as @xmath110 falls below unity , at a given @xmath11 , the bounces , and thus structure formation , will cease there but structure formation will continue in the ever smaller spatial regions where @xmath110 continues to exceed unity .",
    "we see that both potentials @xmath135 and @xmath144 drive the cosmology toward the avtd regime characterized by ( [ avtdeq ] ) as @xmath39 with @xmath195 . this is because @xmath135 appears and influences the dynamics only when and where @xmath132 while @xmath144 does so only for @xmath138 . in the avtd regime , with @xmath196 , both corresponding terms in the wave equation for @xmath5 are exponentially small .",
    "we note that the wave equations ( [ gowdywavep ] ) and ( [ gowdywaveq ] ) provide no other mechanism to drive @xmath112 into the required range if it is not there initially .",
    "recall that the polarized gowdy model can have any value for @xmath112 .",
    "thus we argue that at isolated points ( a set of measure zero in @xmath11 ) where either @xmath99 or @xmath197 is precisely zero , @xmath112 could remain outside the allowed range . in the former case ( say at @xmath198 ) , the consistency equations ( [ peqgm ] ) are satisfied so that one expects the solution at @xmath199 to be like an avtd polarized solution . however , in the latter case ( say at @xmath200 ) , the consistency conditions require @xmath201 as well as @xmath148something one does not expect generically . if @xmath201 at @xmath149 , then the solution is of the avtd large @xmath110 type there . if @xmath202 , the behavior can not be analyzed either numerically or by these analytic methods .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the simulations provide strong support for the conjecture that the gowdy models have a singularity which is avtd except , perhaps , at a set of measure zero .",
    "the existence of this set of measure zero of `` non - generic '' spatial points can be inferred from the simulations since near them the potentials are very flat .",
    "thus , the closer one is to e.g. @xmath199 or @xmath149 defined as above , the longer it will take to drive @xmath112 to the range @xmath203 there .",
    "this manifests itself as a resolution dependence of the simulations of a very specific type . at any value of @xmath12 ( say @xmath204 ) , there is a spatial resolution sufficient to resolve all spiky features .",
    "( this was demonstrated in @xcite . ) but the `` center '' of each spiky feature is the site of a non - generic point .",
    "as one moves away from this point in either direction in @xmath11 , the coefficient of the potential will be larger .",
    "thus the interaction with the potential will occur first at regions away from the center of the feature and move closer to the center as @xmath12 increases .",
    "since the effect of the interaction is to change the sign of either @xmath112 or @xmath205 , the interactions will tend to eliminate the outer part of the spiky feature . thus the spiky feature gets narrower in time until for some @xmath206 ,",
    "the original resolution is no longer adequate .",
    "although , in a peak near @xmath148 , @xmath112 should be @xmath207 , inadequate resolution may act as an effective averaging to give a measured smaller value of @xmath112 .",
    "thus the peak in @xmath110 appears to decrease in amplitude only because , at most @xmath11 values , the interaction with @xmath144 has already occurred .",
    "we note that this effective averaging will give @xmath48 everywhere for some @xmath208 for any fixed spatial resolution . as the spatial resolution",
    "is increased , @xmath208 will also increase since accurate resolution of spiky features can be maintained farther into the simulation and the effective averaging will take longer to come into play . thus the apparent resolution dependence is consistent with the behavior of the potentials @xmath135 and @xmath144 expected near the non - generic points .",
    "several examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ ptau2res][pneg ] . in fig .",
    "[ ptau2res ] , a spiky feature in @xmath112 is shown for three different spatial resolutions at @xmath209 . while the coarsest resolution shows @xmath159 , it also clearly fails to resolve the spiky feature .",
    "the highest resolution both resolves the spiky feature and shows that it has a core where @xmath40 as expected .",
    "a similar spiky feature in @xmath112 is shown in fig .",
    "[ threetaus ] for three different times for the same spatial resolution .",
    "one expects that the clearly resolved spike observed early in the simulation will narrow as @xmath12 increases remaining always @xmath207 at the center of the peak .",
    "this is not observed ( rather one sees the constant @xmath112 behavior expected in the avtd limit ) .",
    "however , one again sees clearly that the spatial resolution which was adequate at @xmath210 has become inadequate at later times and that the properties of the spike are not correctly represented .",
    "[ qnarrow ] shows that the apparent discontinuity in @xmath10 becomes narrower and steeper with time and eventually is not adequately resolved at a given spatial resolution .",
    "one expects @xmath5 to be increasingly negative at the center of this feature since @xmath132 is maintained at that non - generic point . at fixed spatial resolution , we see in fig .",
    "[ pneg ] that the negative region of @xmath5 both narrows and deepens as @xmath12 increases from @xmath211 to @xmath212 as expected .",
    "however , at @xmath213 , the expected behavior is not seen since the depth of the negative region fails to increase .",
    "however , we also see that the spatial resolution has become inadequate .",
    "presumably , adequate spatial resolution would show the narrowness and depth of the negative region suggested by the curvature of @xmath5 vs @xmath11 in the region just outside the core .    in conclusion , the behavior of generic gowdy cosmologies on @xmath0 can be completely understood in terms of the nonlinear interactions between the two polarizations of the gravitational waves .",
    "these act as effective potentials which drive the system to the prediced avtd behavior and then cease to play a role . at the set of measure zero where the potentials are absent",
