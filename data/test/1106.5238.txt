    "dynamical numerical simulations and spectral observations for ( 3200 ) phaethon support ( 2 ) pallas , which is outer main belt asteroids , is the most likely parent body of ( 3200 ) phaethon ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , objects that display cometary activities in the main - belt asteroid ( mba ) region have recently been discovered .",
    "they are classified as main - belt comets ( mbcs ) @xcite ; the mbcs are 133p / elst - pizzaro @xcite , p/2005 u1 @xcite , 176p / linear @xcite , p/2008 r1 ( garrad ) @xcite , p/2010 a2 ( linear ) @xcite , p/2010 r2 ( la sagra ) @xcite , and ( 596 ) scheila ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one possible activation mechanism for mbcs is impacts with small ( e.g. , meter - sized ) objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the other activation mechanisms are rotational - fissions due to the spin - up by yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack ( yorp ) effects @xcite , and thermal influences @xcite .",
    "interesting properties of mbcs are their dynamical origin and possible function as reservoirs for water - ice and organics . a numerical integration by @xcite states that the origin of 133p / elst - pizarro , 176p / linear , and p/2005 u1 ( read ) is concordant with the themis family of asteroids .",
    "compared with all asteroids , the themis family of asteroids includes b - type asteroids at a relatively high population rate .",
    "some b - type asteroids in the themis family seem to have experienced aqueous alterations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( 3200 ) phaethon is also a b - type asteroid and shows the existence of aqueous alteration materials @xcite .",
    "in addition , water - ice and organics are detected on the surface of ( 24 ) themis @xcite and ( 65 ) cybele , which orbits along the outer edge of the main belt @xcite .",
    "the study of comet - asteroid transition objects provides keys to the dynamical origin and evolution of neos , the mutual collisions of small solar system bodies , the material differences between asteroids and comets , and the origin of earth s water .",
    "this study s purpose is to obtain the rotational states , shape model , and rotational color variations for 107p / wilson - harrington ( also know as ( 4015 ) wilson - harrington ; hereafter 107p ) , which is a representative comet - asteroid transition object .",
    "107p was discovered accompanied by a faint cometary tail at palomar observatory in 1949 @xcite .",
    "the object , however , could not be tracked because of insufficient observations to determine an accurate orbit .",
    "later , a near - earth asteroid 1979va (= 4015 ) was discovered .",
    "subsequent observations identified asteroid ( 4015 ) 1979va and 107p as the same object . despite a devoted search , no cometary activity has been detected since the initial observation of 107p ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "107p is an apollo asteroid whose orbital parameters are a = 2.639 au , e = 0.624 , i = 2.785@xmath14 , and the tisserand parameters ( @xmath15 ) = 3.08 . a numerical simulation by @xcite mentions that there is a 4 % chance that 107p has a jfc origin and a 65% chance it has an origin in the outer main - belt region .",
    "taxonomically , it is categorized as a cf - type @xcite . the reflectance spectrum in the region 38006200",
    " is similar to ( 3200 ) phaethon @xcite .",
    "the thermal properties of 107p have been investigated by mid - infrared photometry with nasa s spitzer telescope @xcite .",
    "these observations show that the beaming parameter , the diameter , and the albedo are @xmath16 = 1.39 @xmath17 0.26 , @xmath18 = 3.46 @xmath17 0.32 @xmath19 , and @xmath20 = 0.059 @xmath17 0.011 , respectively . the rotational period of 107p has been reported to be 3.556 @xmath2 and 6.10 @xmath17 0.05 @xmath2 by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite ascribes the difference of the two reports to the noisy data of @xcite because of the weather conditions .",
    "the few days observation in both reports , however , is not enough to determine the correct rotational period .",
    "longer observations are required to derive the correct rotational period and other physical properties .",
    "we hypothesize that 107p migrates to the neo region from the outer main - belt region inhabited by six of seven known mbcs , and impacts with small objects could eject dust and/or expose sub - surface ice that then trigger 107p s cometary activity .",
    "post - mbc , 107p is capable of becoming host to water - ice , organics , and aqueous alteration materials . in this hypothesis",
    ", the impacts influence would be apparent in the rotational states and/or the surface color variations .",
    "we had an opportunity to observe 107p from august 2009 to march 2010 .",
    "our long observation campaigns enable us to derive the rotational states , shape model , and rotational color variations .",
    "furthermore , the orbit of 107p makes it accessible by spacecraft .",

    "we discuss the possibility of tumbling . there were some reports in which asteroid lightcurves indicated tumbling , e.g. , ( 253 ) mathilde @xcite , ( 3288 ) seleucus @xcite , and ( 4179 ) toutatis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite assessed the validity of tumbling for these asteroids based on whether the lightcurves could be approximated with two - dimensional fourier series and the physical model of tumbling could be constructed .",
    "the two - dimensional fourier series is described in the following form    @xmath41\\\\ \\nonumber             & + & \\sum^{m}_{k=1}\\sum^{m}_{j =- m}\\left[c_{jk}\\cos\\left(\\frac{2{\\pi}j}{p_{\\psi}}+\\frac{2{\\pi}k}{p_{\\phi}}\\right)t\\right.\\\\              & + & \\left .",
    "s_{jk}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2{\\pi}j}{p_{\\psi}}+\\frac{2{\\pi}k}{p_{\\phi}}\\right)t\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the order , @xmath43 is the mean reduced light flux , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the fourier coefficients for the linear combination of the two frequencies @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , and @xmath48 is the time . substituting @xmath42 = @xmath49 , @xmath50 = @xmath0 @xmath1 , and @xmath51 = @xmath3 @xmath1 for 107p , we obtain a fitting curve , as shown in fig .",
    "the fitting curve adequately reconstructs the trend of the lightcurve .",
    "however , since the sidereal rotation period and the processing period have a commensurability of 3:1 , the lightcurve can also be reconstructed using the one - dimensional fourier series of sixth order .",
    "as we mentioned in section 3.2 , the physical model is possibly constructed using a lam of @xmath4:@xmath5:@xmath6 = 1.0:1.0:1.6 , ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) or ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , @xmath52 = @xmath11 , @xmath50 = @xmath0 @xmath1 , and @xmath51 = @xmath3 @xmath1 .",
    "although @xcite mentions that a tumbling asteroid generally does not return to the same orientation in any single period , the approximately equal length of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for 107p suggests a negligible change for the nutation angle .",
    "therefore , 107p can return to the same orientation every @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "these circumstances imply that 107p might be a tumbling object .    assuming 107p is a tumbler , external forces are required to trigger the motion .",
    "impacts of small objects , tidal encounters with planets , and yorp effects are suggested by @xcite .",
    "though 107p is a neo , the object did not have an encounter with earth in 1949 . in the case of km - size objects ,",
    "the efficient onset of tumbling by yorp requires a longer timescale than that of collision with small objects @xcite .",
    "therefore , we propose the impact of small objects as a probable cause for tumbling of 107p . the orbital origin of 107p has a high possibility of being from the outer mba region inhabited by mbcs .",
    "one possibility is that the cometary activities of mbcs are caused by impacts of small objects .",
    "we can consider that 107p is originally an object like an mbc and impacts with small objects in the neo region could eject dust and/or expose sub - surface ice that then trigger 107p s cometary activity .",
    "when we suppose that the collisional excitation happened in 1949 , the damping timescale @xcite is expressed as    @xmath53    where @xmath18 is the mean diameter of tumblers in kilometer units and @xmath54 is a constant of about 17 ( uncertain by about a factor of 2.5 ) .",
    "the units of @xmath50 and @xmath55 are hours and billion ( @xmath56 ) of years , respectively .",
    "since the damping timescale of around @xmath57 @xmath58 is long enough , 107p would continue tumbling even if the impact occurred before 1949 .",
    "we describe the situation in which 107p hosts a binary . in order to confirm the existence of a binary",
    ", the detection of mutual eclipse events is required in the lightcurve .",
    "the mutual eclipse events were not detected in the observations of @xcite and @xcite because of the viewing angle , the lower photometric precision , or the absence of the binary .",
    "on the other hand , we detected the around same flux decrease in every 0.50 phase .",
    "therefore , the existence of the binary is conceivable as the other interpretation of the shape model c. if we define the flux decrease around the phase of 0.15 ( or 0.30 , 0.45 ) and 0.65 ( or 0.80 , 0.95 ) in fig .",
    "6 as the primary ( secondary ) eclipse and the secondary ( primary ) eclipse , respectively , the orbital period of the binary is @xmath0 @xmath1 . supposing a circular orbit and negligible mass for the binary , the semi - major axis is described as    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the gravitational constant , @xmath61 is the mass of 107p , and @xmath62 is the orbital period of the binary . for the sake of simplicity , when assuming that 107p is spherical with the diameter of 3.46 @xmath19 @xcite and a typical density of 2 @xmath63 , the semi - major axis is around 3.65 @xmath19 . in the case of the same albedo for 107p and the binary ,",
    "the flux decrease of the total eclipse ( @xmath64 ) satisfies the following relationship @xcite    @xmath65,\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 is the radius of the binary and @xmath67 is the radius of 107p . since the typical flux decrease is @xmath680.05 @xmath69 in fig .",
    "6 , the radius of the binary is around 0.4 @xmath19 . when we assume the orbital plane of 107p accords with the line of sight from an observer , the inclination of the binary as an occulter satisfies    @xmath70    here , @xmath71 is the inclination of the binary for the orbital plane of 107p is less than 36@xmath14 in the 107p system .",
    "if @xmath71 is zero , the eclipse duration is estimated to be @xmath680.05 @xmath1 .",
    "the term is around one - sixth of the orbital period and consistent with the interval of lightcurve peaks of fig .",
    "moreover , the binary hypothesis indicates that the double - peak period of the lightcurve without the eclipse becomes @xmath72 @xmath1 . as we mentioned in section 3.1 , the period of @xmath72 @xmath1 as the sidereal rotation of 107p is not likely .",
    "alternatively , the lightcurve without the eclipse might be a quadruple - peak lightcurve whose period is @xmath0 @xmath1 . though the quadruple - peak lightcurve is rare , the period could compatibly account for all the past reports .",
    "in addition , the situation shows that the sidereal rotation of 107p and the orbital periods of the binary are locked with @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the period of @xmath3 @xmath1 is explained by the period between the egress time of the primary ( secondary ) eclipse and the ingress time of the secondary ( primary ) eclipse .    the promising mechanisms for formation of asteroid binaries are the rotational - fission due to the spin - up by yorp effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , tidal encounter with planets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the escaping ejecta by the collisions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanisms have a lot in common with the cause of tumbling .",
    "fissions and collisions in every mechanism can trigger 107p s cometary activity .",
    "the possible existence of a binary is consistent with the past cometary activity .",
    "this study revealed the physical properties of 107p by a photometric observation campaign .",
    "we detected the lightcurve periodicity to be @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath3 @xmath1 with a commensurability of 3:1 .",
    "the multiband photometry indicates that the taxonomy class of 107p is c - type .",
    "no clear rotational color variations are confirmed on the surface .",
    "we suggested two models to explain the different interpretations of the lightcurve periodicity .",
    "the commensurability reflects tumbling with the sidereal rotation period of @xmath0 @xmath1 and the precession period of @xmath3 @xmath1 .",
    "the shape is a lam of @xmath4:@xmath5:@xmath6 = 1.0:1.0:1.6 . around the same length of @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "shows the nutation angle is approximately constant at @xmath11 .",
    "the direction of total rotational angular momentum is around @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "107p returns to the same orientation every @xmath0 @xmath1 by retrograde motion .",
    "impacts of small objects are suggested as a cause for the tumbling and comet activity .",
    "alternatively , the past comet activity itself is thought to be a cause of the tumbling , like a 1p / halley @xcite .",
    "107p is not a tumbler .",
    "the sidereal rotation period is @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the shape is roughly spherical but slightly hexagonal with a sam of @xmath4:@xmath5:@xmath6 = 1.5:1.0:1.0 .",
    "the pole orientation is around @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the sense of rotation is retrograde .",
    "the lightcurve of commensurability would reflect a discriminative appearance like ( 2867 ) steins , which has been explored by the rosetta spacecraft @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the lightcurve also indicates the possibility of hosting a binary whose orbital period is @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of a binary is also consistent with the past cometary activity .",
    "finally , we describe the mission feasibility for 107p .",
    "the orbit accessible by spacecraft makes 107p a promising target for a sample - return mission .",
    "if 107p is not a tumbling object , the moderate rotational period of @xmath0 @xmath1 would enable us to obtain a sample by the touchdown of a spacecraft , whereas touchdown on 107p would require a difficult maneuver if 107p is a tumbler .",
    "in that case , a multi - fly - by mission that combines with the sample return mission for another target would become a hopeful plan .",
