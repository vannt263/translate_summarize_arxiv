    "the cell formation problem as a part of group technology ( gt ) was introduced by @xcite and @xcite . in the most general formulation",
    "it is designed to reduce production costs by grouping machines and parts into manufacturing cells ( production shops ) .",
    "the goal of such kind of grouping is to set up manufacturing process in a way that maximizes loading of machines within the cells and minimizes movement of parts from one cell to another . in classical formulation",
    "the problem is defined by a binary matrix @xmath0 with @xmath1 rows representing machines and @xmath2 columns representing parts . in this machine - part matrix @xmath3 if part @xmath4 is processed on machine @xmath5 .",
    "the objective is to form production cells , which consist of machines and parts together , optimizing some production metrics such as machine loading and intercell movement .    as an example of input data we will consider the instance of @xcite shown in table  [ table1 ]",
    "this instance consists of 5 machines and 7 parts .",
    "the ones in a machine - part matrix are called _ operations_. in table  [ table2 ] a solution with 2 manufacturing cells is presented .",
    "the first manufacturing cell contains machines @xmath6 , @xmath7 with parts @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the second manufacturing cell contains machines @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12 with parts @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17 .",
    "some parts have to be moved from one cell to another for processing ( e.g. part @xmath17 needs to be processed on machine @xmath6 , so it should be transported from its cell 2 to cell 1 ) . the operations lying outside cells are called _ exceptional elements _ or _ exceptions_. there can be also non - operation elements inside cells ( @xmath18 = 0 ) .",
    "these elements reduce machine load and are called _",
    "voids_. so the goal is to minimize the number of exceptions and the number of voids at the same time .",

    "the majority of them provide heuristic solutions and only a few exact methods have been suggested .",
    "@xcite provided two minpcut exact models based on the well - known k - cut graph partition problem .",
    "the objective function considered in this research is minimization of the exceptional elements number for a fixed number of cells .",
    "unfortunately this objective function does not address the load inside cells .",
    "@xcite presented a mixed - integer linear programming model which maximizes the most popular objective for the cell formation problem - the grouping efficacy , introduced by  @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested to apply dinkelbach algorithm since the grouping efficacy is a fractional objective function .",
    "their model allows solving the cell formation problem only if the number of production cells is predefined .",
    "thus the suggested approach can not guarantee global optimality of the obtained solutions with respect to a variable number of production cells .",
    "in many cases the computational times for this model are quite long or memory limitations are exceeded and the optimal solutions can not be found .",
    "@xcite introduced two approaches for solving the cell formation problem with the grouping efficacy objective .",
    "the first is a mixed - integer linear programming model which is based on a general two - mode clustering formulation with some simplifying assumptions ( e.g. the numbers of clusters by rows and columns are equal ) .",
    "this model looks interesting , but requires too much time to be solved for many even medium - sized instances .",
    "the second approach is a branch - and - bound algorithm combined with a relocation heuristic to obtain an initial solution .",
    "the branch and bound approach is able to solve about two times more problem instances and the computational times are greatly improved as well .",
    "generally it runs fine on well - structured ( with grouping efficacy value @xmath19 0.65 - 0.7 ) medium - sized problems .",
    "two major assumptions are made for both of these approaches : singletons are permitted ( manufacturing cells containing only one machine or one part ) that is quite a common practice ; residual cells are permitted ( cells containing only machines without parts , or only parts without machines ) .",
    "also the number of production cells is predefined for the both approaches , but for some test instances several values for the number of cells are considered in computational experiments .",
    "another model is provided in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "there we present a mixed - integer linear programming formulation for the cell formation problem with a variable number of production cells .",
    "it deals well with small - sized instances , but nevertheless the number of variables and constraints is huge - o(@xmath20 ) .",
    "this does not allow obtaining solutions even for some moderate - sized test instances and in some cases this model runs too slowly .",
    "some authors used biclustering approaches to solve the cell formation problem .",
    "@xcite applied simultaneous clustering for both dimensions ( machines and parts ) and minimized the number of voids plus the number of exceptional elements .",
    "@xcite reduced the cell formation problem to another biclustering problem - bicluster graph editing problem and suggested an exact method and a linear programming model which provides good computational results for the grouping efficacy objective .      in this paper",
    "we develop a fast compact model providing optimal solutions for the cell formation problem with a variable number of manufacturing cells and the grouping efficacy objective . unlike the majority of linear programming models",
    "our model does not contain a direct assignment of machines or parts to cells .",
    "we use machine - machine and part - machine assignments instead of the widely used machine - part - cell assignment .",
    "this leads to a compact and elegant formulation considering only constraints which ensure a block - diagonal structure of solutions .",
    "it allows us to drastically reduce the number of variables and constraints in our mixed integer linear program and obtain globally optimal solutions even for some large - sized problem instances .",
    "computational experiments show that our model outperforms all known exact methods .",
    "we have solved 63 of 67 problem instances to the global optimum with respect to a variable number of production cells .",
    "we have also found several new solutions unknown before .",
    "we would like to highlight that many researchers in the field use the 35 gt instances dataset provided by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately some problem instances in the dataset have inconsistencies with the original papers they are published in .",
    "we made a great work on inspecting all the original sources , comparing and forming the corrected version of this popular dataset .",
    "we have also collected many other problem instances less popular and formed a new dataset .",
    "all these data are free and can be downloaded from our website http:// www.opt-hub.com[http://www.opt-hub.com ] ( you can also upload your own solutions there ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_formulation ]",
    "we provide the formulation of the cell formation problem .",
    "then in section [ sec_model ] we present our new mixed - integer linear programming model .",
    "sections [ sec_datasets ] contains the information about datasetes we used for our experiments and the computational results and comparisons to other exact approaches are given in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "the conclusion is provided in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "[ subsec_contrib ]",
    "cellular manufacturing systems apply are aimed to process similar parts within the same production cell , balance machines workload and minimize parts movement from one cell to another during the production process .",
    "the most popular objective for the cell formation problem is the grouping efficacy introduced by @xcite :    @xmath21 where    @xmath22  the total number of operations ( ones ) in the machine - part matrix ,    @xmath23  the number of operations performed inside cells ,    @xmath24  the number of voids ( zeros inside cells ) .    in comparisson to the other objectives the grouping efficacy function addresses the best block - diagonal structure of the cell formation problem solutions @xcite .    in the literature",
    "several constraints related to the minimal size of a cell could be found .",
    "the following are the three most popular consideratons :    * allowing residual cells ( cells containing only machines or parts ) * allowing singletons ( cells with one machine and several parts or vice versa ) and prohibiting residual cells * allowing only cells with at least 2 machines and 2 parts    the most popular option is allowing singletons and prohibiting residual cells . in this section for the classical formulation",
    "we assume that singletons can appear in solutions and residual cells are prohibited . in our new model and in computational experiments",
    "we consider the first two options .",
    "a straightforward fractional integer programming model for the cell formation problem with the grouping efficacy objective function allowing singletons and prohibiting residual cells is given below .",
    "we use the following notation : @xmath1 is the number of machines , @xmath2 is the number of parts,@xmath18 equals to 1 if machine @xmath5 processes part @xmath4 and @xmath25 is the maximal possible number of production cells . since each production cell has to contain at least one machine and at least one part we set @xmath26 .",
    "+   + decision variables : @xmath27 @xmath28@xmath29 +   + @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    objective function is the grouping efficacy measure where the numerator is the number of ones inside cells ( @xmath23 ) and two sums in the denominator are the total number of ones ( @xmath22 ) and the number of zeros inside cells ( @xmath24 ) respectively . constraints and require that each machine and each part is assigned to exactly one production cell .",
    "the following two inequalities and prohibit residual cells ( without machines or parts ) .",
    "the left part of is the total number of machines assigned to the particular cell ( this sum is not greater then @xmath1 ) and the right part is the total number of parts assigned to that cell ( multiplied by @xmath1 ) .",
    "it means that if we have at least one machine assigned to some cell there should be at least one part assigned to this cell .",
    "this model allows us to have any number of cells in the optimal solution .",
    "for example if optimal solution has only two cells then variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 will be zero for all @xmath36 except only two values of @xmath36 .",
    "in our paper  @xcite we have proposed a mixed - integer linear programming model for the cell formation problem which is very similar to the one described in the previous section .",
    "one of the most important points there was linearization of the grouping efficacy objective .",
    "our previous idea was to linearize the grouping efficacy objective function by fixing the value of denominator @xmath37 and considering a range of all possible numbers of voids @xmath24 .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath24 equals to 0 because generally there can be a solution without any voids .",
    "the upper bound is computed using the following proposition .",
    "the number of voids in the optimal solution satisfies the following inequality : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the grouping efficacy value of any feasible solution .",
    "so if we know a feasible solution we can limit the range of possible values for the number of voids .",
    "unfortunately , the performance of this approach strongly depends on the feasible solution we use for obtaining our bounds . this way solving problem instances where grouping efficacy value is low takes too much computational resources ( since the number of subtasks is too large ) and sometimes we are unable to solve even medium - sized cell formation instances",
    ".    in this paper together with using our new mixed - integer linear model we use another way of linearization  @xcite algorithm . the parametric approach introduced by w.dinkelbach",
    "is one of the most general and popular strategies for fractional programming .",
    "it reduces the solution of a fractional programming problem to the solution of a sequence of simpler problems . if we consider a fractional programming model with the following objective function :    @xmath40    then dinkelbach procedure is the following :    * * step 1 * take some feasible solution @xmath41 , compute @xmath42 and let @xmath43 * * step 2 * solve the original problem with objective function @xmath44 replaced with @xmath45 and let @xmath46 be the optimal solution * * step 3 * if @xmath47 ( or less then some predefined tolerance ) then stop the procedure and return @xmath46 as the optimal solution . else",
    "@xmath48 and goto step 2 .",
    "@xcite have also used dinkelbach approach for linearization of grouping efficacy measure .",
    "although their computational times are quite high and the results are given only for the particular fixed number of production cells .",
    "due to a large number of variables and constraints in three - index model @xcite cplex spends too much computational resources solving even small - sized instances ( we have solved only 14 of 35 problem instances ) .",
    "here we introduce a two - index mixed - integer linear programming model for the cell formation problem .",
    "the key idea of this model is removing machine - part - cell relation as it has been done in many works before .",
    "instead of mapping elements to cells we use a simple fact that machines within the same production cell have the same set of parts assigned to that cell .",
    "the two - index model combines well with the dinkelbach algorithm and shows impressing performance even on large - sized problem instances .",
    "two - index model : @xmath49 @xmath50 + @xmath51 + @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56    technically matrix @xmath57 here can be replaced by the one with part - part relations , however the number of machines in problem instances is usually lower than the number of parts ( for large - sized instances the difference is significant ) . as a result",
    "we have @xmath58 variables from matrix @xmath57 and @xmath59 variables from matrix @xmath60 .",
    "objective function is the grouping efficacy measure linearized using dinkelbach method .",
    "constraints , , set relations between machines and parts to ensure the solution can be transformed into the block - diagonal form ( which means its feasibility ) .",
    "the last two inequalities and are optional and prohibit residual cells .",
    "we start with setting @xmath61 equal to the best known efficacy value for the considered cell formation problem instance .",
    "then we sequentially solve several two - index problems according to the dinkelbach algorithm and update @xmath61 value with the solutions found until our objective function is above 0 .",
    "[ testset_a_problems ]",
    "for our computational experiments we have used two datasets , _ testset a _ and _ testset b_.    * testset a - classic*. the first dataset is a classical 35 gt problem set taken from @xcite .",

    "this dataset is very popular among cell formation researchers and there are lots of computational results obtained by different methods ( heuristics and metaheuristics generally ) . as we highlighted before some problem instances in this dataset have inconsistencies with the original papers they are published in .",
