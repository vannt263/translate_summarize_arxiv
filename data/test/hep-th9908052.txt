    "it is generally expected that in a full description of quantum gravity the geometry of space - time at small scales will not resemble that of a manifold .",
    "the nature of this `` quantum geometry '' is one of the fundamental issues in the search for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "one argument for quantum geometry is that quantum field theories give our best descriptions of microscopic physics , yet they must be regularized in order to yield meaningful predictions .",
    "the trouble being that quantum field theory suffers from ultra - violet divergences due to physical processes occurring at arbitrarily large momenta , or equivalently , arbitrarily small distances .",
    "some fundamental regularization that fixes these divergences can probably be interpreted as a modification of geometry at extremely short distances , perhaps even such that the concept of arbitrarily small distances is meaningless .",
    "another argument extends heisenberg s classic _ gedankenexperiment _ in support of the uncertainty relations .",
    "the observation of structures at very small distances requires radiation of very short wavelength and correspondingly large energy . attempting to observe a sufficiently small structure",
    "would thus require such a high concentration of energy that a black hole would be formed and no observation could be made .",
    "if this is so , then distances below about the plank scale are unobservable  and thus operationally meaningless .    if short distances are meaningless , then perhaps precise locations are as well .",
    "this suggests the possibility of uncertainty relations between position and position , analogous to the standard ones between position and momentum ; this has been argued on physical grounds ( see @xcite , or @xcite for a review ) and from string theory ( see @xcite ) . an uncertainty relation between , say , @xmath4-position and @xmath5-position ,",
    "would mean that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 coordinates do not commute .",
    "since coordinates are just functions on space(-time ) this suggests that the algebra of functions on space might not be commutative ( see @xcite ) . that is the fundamental idea of noncommutative geometry .    in noncommutative geometry ( see @xcite ) , familiar geometric concepts ( metric , measure , bundle , etc . )",
    "are reformulated in an entirely algebraic way .",
    "this allows the generalization of geometry by replacing the algebra of functions on space with a noncommutative algebra .",
    "it may be that such a noncommutative generalization of ordinary geometry can describe the true quantum geometry of space - time .",
    "as i will explain , noncommutativity is no guarantor of regularization ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", i will discuss a specific class of noncommutative geometries which do have the requisite regularization property .",
    "these models are not physically realistic ; they generalize euclidean ( space ) rather than lorentzian ( space - time ) geometry ( a sin shared by lattice models ) and they are not gauge theories .",
    "however , it is plausible that more realistic models may share some of the characteristics of these ones .",
    "although regularization in these geometries is quite manifest , a toolkit for coaxing actual predictions from field theory there has been lacking . my aim here is to present an approximation technique for field theory calculations in this regularization .",
    "this will show the leading order effects of noncommutativity on quantum field theory .",
    "the existing theory of noncommutative geometry ( see @xcite ) is largely inspired by the so - called gelfand theorem . according to this theorem",
    ", there is an exact correspondence between commutative c@xmath6-algebras and locally compact topological spaces . for any locally compact topological space",
    ", the algebra of continuous functions vanishing at @xmath7 is a commutative c@xmath6-algebra , and any commutative c@xmath6-algebra can be realized in this way .",
    "this suggests that c@xmath6-algebras in general should be considered as noncommutative algebras of `` continuous functions '' , and thus that the category of c@xmath6-algebras is the category of noncommutative topologies .",
    "the next step is to go from noncommutative topology to noncommutative geometry ; the most versatile noncommutative version of a riemannian metric is given by a dirac operator .",
    "on an ordinary manifold , taking the commutator of the dirac operator , @xmath8 , with a differentiable function gives @xmath9_- = i\\gamma^jf_j \\mbox.\\ ] ] taking the norm of this gives @xmath10_-\\rvert } = { \\lvert\\nabla f\\rvert}$ ] ; thus , the dirac operator can detect the maximum slope of a function . from this , a construction for the distance between two points can be obtained ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this shows that the dirac operator contains all information of the riemannian metric .",
    "it also knows which functions are differentiable , smooth , lipschitz , etc .",
    "a c@xmath6-algebra with a dirac operator thus constitutes a noncommutative riemannian geometry . using a couple of additional structures",
    ", it is possible to characterize noncommutative riemannian manifolds axiomatically ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is only known how to do this for what amounts to metrics of _ positive definite _ signature .",
    "this does not allow for the noncommutative generalization of space - time .",
    "another problem with these noncommutative manifolds is that they _ do not _ tend to regularize quantum field theory .",
    "a variation of noncommutative geometry that does have this property is matrix geometry ( see @xcite ) . in matrix geometry",
    ", every structure has only finite degrees of freedom .",
    "unfortunately , there is no axiomatic characterization of matrix geometries , as for noncommutative manifolds .",
    "the problem of characterizing noncommutative space - time is daunting ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the trouble is that the analytic properties of the dirac operator which are essential in the positive - definite case are not there in space - time . with everything finite ,",
    "all analytic considerations evaporate in the case of matrix geometry , suggesting that the problem of noncommutative space - time might be solvable once matrix geometry is better understood .",
    "most existing applications of noncommutative geometry to physics have concerned connes - lott models . in these ( with",
    "the question of space - time deferred ) a simple type of noncommutative manifold provides an interesting interpretation of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "in particular , the higgs field and gauge bosons are unified .    here",
    ", i am pursuing a different way of applying noncommutative geometry to physics .",
    "i am following @xcite and exploring the regularization effects of matrix geometry .",

    "as the name suggests , geometric quantization was originally intended as a systematic mathematical procedure for constructing quantum mechanics from classical mechanics .",
    "geometric quantization applies to a symplectic manifold ( originally , phase space ) with some additional structure ( a `` polarization '' ) .",

    ", @xmath25 should be something like the size of the universe  a far larger scale , so @xmath40 must be _ very _ large .",

    "as i have claimed , and the above examples have corroborated , nonplanarity of a feynman diagram tends to decrease its degree of divergence . in the standard regularizations ,",
    "the ultra - violet divergences are associated with the loops in the feynman diagram .",
    "it appears that the divergences when @xmath177 with @xmath162 fixed are associated more closely with the loops in the doubled diagram  index loops , in the terminology of t  hooft @xcite .",
    "the number of index loops is always less than or equal to the number of loops in the original diagram .",
    "although an arbitrary framed feynman diagram , @xmath203 , may not fit into the plane , it will always fit onto some oriented surface .",
    "such a surface , @xmath296 , can be constructed systematically by filling in a 2-cell for each line in the doubled diagram .",
    "it will have the topology of a riemann surface with at least one puncture ; each external leg of @xmath203 ends at a puncture .",
    "our first example , fig .",

    "in fact , @xmath191 is the momentum flowing across @xmath304 .",
    "the other part of the feynman integrand depending on @xmath190 is the product of propagators on the edges of @xmath304 ; each of these has the form @xmath306",

    "the result may have an integrable singularity at @xmath307 ( an infra - red divergence because @xmath176 ) , but is otherwise finite , and falls of exponentially .",
    "this means that integration over @xmath190 does not contribute to the ultra - violet divergence ; moreover , if @xmath191 is also an internal momentum , then integration over @xmath191 will not contribute to the divergence either .",
    "the other important limit is the commutative limit .",
    "this is when @xmath25 is fixed , but @xmath308 and @xmath177 . in light of the deformation approximation",
    ", it appears that the behavior in this limit will be very much like that of the most elementary regularization , a simple momentum cutoff .",
    "for a single , complex scalar field , the general @xmath309-invariant action is s[]:=_,[complex.action]where @xmath310 is some real polynomial , lower bounded on the positive axis .",
    "the standard perturbation theory for this complex scalar field is not much different from that of the real field .",
    "every edge of a feynman diagram is now directed , and each vertex must have an equal number of ingoing and outgoing edges .    the regularized action corresponding to this is a simple generalization of the real case .",

    "this restriction has an interesting interpretation in terms of the doubled diagram .",
    "there are really two types of lines in the doubled diagram , those on the left of a directed edge in the original diagram , and those on the right .",
    "the restriction is simply that left edges only connect to left edges and right to right .",
    "so far , i have only discussed topologically trivial scalar fields .",

    "the inner product on @xmath111 leads to an inner product on @xmath317 ; because of this , for @xmath318 , we can define the product @xmath319 to be an element of @xmath22 .",

    "left lines correspond to @xmath42 ; right lines correspond to @xmath317 .",
    "the complex scalar field really just wanted to be twisted .",
    "there is not much to be said about topologically nontrivial fields in the deformation approximation . from a local perspective ,",
    "a nontrivial vector bundle is just a vector bundle with a fixed background gauge field . in the limit as @xmath176 , this gauge field vanishes .",
    "fermi statistics do not pose any particular obstacle in this regularization scheme .",
    "however , the kinetic terms for fermion action functionals may be more difficult to construct than that for bosons . whereas constructing a cutoff laplacian is elementary on coadjoint orbits",
    ", it is less obvious how to deal with the dirac operator .",
    "even on @xmath1 , there may be trouble .",
    "when the spinor bundle on @xmath1 is quantized by my prescription , the left and right chiral subspaces have different dimensions .",
    "this means that there does not exist a cutoff dirac operator which both anti - commutes with the chirality operator ( @xmath320 ) and has no kernel .",
    "in fact , the difference of the dimensions of the left an right subspaces grows linearly with @xmath40 ; so , if we require the dirac operator to anti - commute with the chirality operator , then the size of the kernel will diverge as @xmath103 .    whether these problems can be circumvented , or whether they are really problems at all , remains to be seen .",
    "in all this i have largely dwelt on the regularization effects of noncommutativity . however ,",
    "if there are effects of noncommutativity which are directly detectable by experiment , then these will probably be tree - level effects .    in field theory on quantized flat space , the phase factors from different framings add up to a sum of cosines of products of momenta .",
