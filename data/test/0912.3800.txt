    "the phases of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at nonzero temperature and density are a subject of continuing interest .",
    "while numerical simulations on the lattice can be of use at nonzero temperature when the quark density is small , standard monte carlo techniques are not of use in cold , dense quark matter .    one expansion which is of utility is to expand in the limit of a large number of colors @xcite .",
    "for cold , dense quark matter  quarks in the fundamental representation , coupled to an @xmath12 gauge theory  this gives a `` quarkyonic '' phase @xcite .",
    "keeping the quark chemical potential , @xmath2 , of order one as the number of color @xmath13 , the free energy for this phase is dominated by that of quarks .",
    "nonetheless , excitations near the fermi surface are confined , perhaps baryonic , whence the name .    in this paper",
    ", we consider chiral symmetry breaking in quarkyonic matter .",
    "we consider a phenomenological model for confinement , taking the timelike component of the gluon propagator to be @xmath14 .",
    "this is valid in coulomb gauge , for a spatial momentum @xmath15 , and corresponds to a potential which rises linearly in coordinate space .",
    "such a propagator was originally suggested by gribov @xcite and zwanziger @xcite . to use such a propagator in cold , dense , quark matter",
    ", it is necessary to assume that gluons are insensitive to screening by quarks .",
    "for this to be true , the number of flavors , @xmath6 , must be @xmath16 , and the chemical potential must satisfy @xmath17 , where @xmath3 is the renormalization mass scale of qcd @xcite .    chiral symmetry breaking in such a model has been studied by glozman and wagenbrunn @xcite and by guo and szczepaniak @xcite , for values of @xmath18 .",
    "we work in the extreme quarkyonic limit , @xmath19 , so that the effects of chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum can be ignored .",
    "it is possible for chiral symmetry breaking to occur at large @xmath2 , since we are , by assumption , in a confined regime .",
    "of course there is no guarantee that our results apply to qcd , where @xmath20 ; nevertheless , there is certainly some range of @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath2 , where it does .",
    "if applicable to qcd , our results are of interest to intermediate densities , where both conventional nuclear physics and perturbative treatments fail .",
    "notably , this may include the astrophysics of neutron stars .    in vacuum",
    ", chiral symmetry breaking occurs through the pairing of a left handed quark with a right handed anti - quark , @xmath21 , and vice versa . this condensate is , of course , spatially uniform , so that the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry does not disturb the lorentz invariance of the vacuum .",
    "now consider the effects of a fermi sea , where there is a net excess of quarks over anti - quarks .",
    "the analogy of the usual condensate is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ qqbar ] .",
    "energetically , it costs essentially zero energy to excite a quark right at the edge of the fermi sea . on the other hand , it costs at least @xmath22 to pull an anti - quark out from deep in the dirac sea .",
    "( remember that we assume that @xmath2 is very large . )",
    "thus the usual condensate can not be formed spontaneously , and anti - quarks will not enter into our analysis henceforth .",
    "there are numerous features which are not captured by the illustration in fig .",
    "[ qqbar ] .",
    "we really should draw not one , but two fermi seas : one for left handed quarks , and one for right handed quarks . to avoid unnecessary duplication , instead",
    "we assume that the quark , denoted by a filled circle , is always left handed , and that the anti - quark , denoted by an open circle , is right handed .",
    "the quark and anti - quark are also assumed to have the same color , so that any condensate is @xmath23 , and survives in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "if the quark has momentum @xmath15 , then the anti - quark , formed by removing a quark with momentum @xmath15 from the dirac sea , has momentum @xmath24 .",
    "thus the quark anti - quark pair has no net momentum , and this condensate is spatially uniform , as in vacuum .    [ 1.0 ] , while its momentum is @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the presence of a fermi sea , though , it is also possible for chiral symmetry to be broken by pairing , say , a ( left - handed ) quark and a ( right - handed ) quark hole . if both the quark and the quark hole are near the edge of the fermi surface , then it costs little energy to excite them , and the energetic penalty paid to excite an antiquark can be avoided .",

    "[ exciton ] is known as an exciton .",
    "naively , we might expect that excitons are suppressed , since the relative momentum between the particle and the hole , @xmath26 , is large .    [ 1.0 ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    however , this is not the only way for quarks and their holes to break the chiral symmetry .",
    "consider pairing a ( left handed ) quark , with momentum @xmath15 , and the hole formed by removing a ( right handed ) quark with the _ opposite _ momentum , @xmath24 , from the fermi sea .",
    "the quark hole then has the same momentum as the quark , @xmath27 , so that the resulting condensate is _ not _ uniform , and has a net momentum @xmath28 ; this is , it varies as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the direction along which the pair moves , @xmath31 .",
    "such condensates do not occur in vacuum , where they would imply the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "though , such non - uniform condensates are common , and known as density waves @xcite ; this is then a chiral density wave .",
    "note that the relative momentum between the quark and its hole is small , so such a condensate may be favored .    [ 1.0 ] , @xmath32.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this paper we show that in the gribov - zwanziger model , that the exciton pairing of fig .",
    "[ exciton ] is not generated , but that the chiral density wave of fig .",

    "again , this is familiar from systems in condensed matter : typically excitons are only created dynamically as resonances , such as by the absorption of light , and usually do not condense .",
    "density waves are common , especially for systems in @xmath8 dimensions @xcite .",
    "we will investigate all dirac and flavor structures , and show which types are preferred .    for completeness , we illustrate the pairing between two quarks which leads to color superconductivity in fig .",
    "[ clr_super ] .",
    "this is pairing between a quark at one edge of the fermi surface , with momentum @xmath27 , and another quark at the other edge , with momentum @xmath24 .",
    "since pairing is between two quarks , the condensate has no net momentum and is spatially uniform .",
    "for this reason , pairing can occur over the entire fermi surface , in a spatially symmetric state .",
    "so far , we have not emphasized the @xmath1 and @xmath6 dependence of pairing , which is not captured by the illustrations in figs .",
    "[ qqbar ] - [ clr_super ] .",
    "the pairing in figs .",
    "[ exciton ] and [ cdw ] is between a quark and a quark hole of the same color , so the condensate is @xmath23 .",
    "further , to the extent that @xmath33 , the condensate is rather insensitive to @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , the diquark pairing of color superconductivity depends upon @xmath1 and @xmath6 in an essential way .",
    "fermi statistics greatly constrains the pairing between two quarks ( or two quark holes ) : it is always anti - symmetric in color , so there are strong relations between the spatial wavefunction , flavor , and chirality . for instance , in case of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , spatially symmetric condensates form by anti - symmetrizing in flavor ; this condensate pairs quarks of the same chirality together , and so does not break the chiral symmetry . on the other hand , for @xmath36 and @xmath35 , the preferred condensate does break the chiral symmetry , through color - flavor locking @xcite .    for more than three colors ,",
    "the gaps for color superconductivity depend sensitively upon which representation one assumes the quarks to lie in .",
    "if the quarks are in the fundamental representation , then since the pairing for color superconductivity is anti - symmetric in the colors of the two quarks , the gap is not a color singlet , and is suppressed at large @xmath1 .",
    "it is also possible , however , to generalize qcd by letting the quarks lie in the two - index , anti - symmetric representation of color @xcite .",
    "this limit is rather different from that which we consider in this paper .",
    "there are @xmath37 quarks in this limit , so that gluons are affected the quarks , and there is no quarkyonic phase .",
    "this is like taking the number of flavors , @xmath6 , to grow with @xmath1 .",
    "in such a limit color superconductivity is not suppressed at large @xmath1 .",
    "it is not clear which of these two limits is most like qcd , with three colors and three light flavors .",
    "we suggest that it is useful to consider all possible limits , and to see what qualitative conclusions might be tested in qcd .",
    "[ 1.0 ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    if a channel for color superconductivity exists , then cooper pairs will form for arbitrarily weak coupling .",
    "thus color superconductivity is always the dominant pairing mechanism at asymptotically large chemical potential .",
    "the essential question is then , how large does the chemical potential have to be for color superconductivity to win out over other pairing mechanisms , such as chiral density waves ?",
    "that chiral density waves @xcite dominate at large @xmath1 was first demonstrated by deryagin , grigoriev , and rubakov @xcite . using a perturbative gluon propagator , @xmath38 in momentum space , they find that chiral density waves form , with a condensate @xmath39 in magnitude , where @xmath40 is the qcd fine structure constant , measured at a scale @xmath41 .",
    "implicitly , the computation assumes that dense quarks form a fermi liquid , so that pairing is from quarks ( and holes ) within @xmath42 of the edge of the fermi sea .",
    "in contrast , quarkyonic matter is not a fermi liquid because of confinement of quarks .",
    "low energy excitations , within @xmath43 of the edge of the fermi sea , interact not through the perturbative gluon propagator , but through the gribov - zwanziger form , @xmath0 . a chiral density wave forms , with the same dirac structure as in perturbation theory . because the relevant momenta for pairing is controlled by a confining potential ,",
    "the quarkyonic condensate for chiral density waves is inevitably @xmath43 in magnitude .",
    "our analysis applies in a regime of intermediate @xmath2 , where the quarkyonic gap is greater in magnitude than the perturbative gap .",
    "we find that for @xmath44 whenever @xmath45 , using @xmath46 .",
    "for the coupling in qcd , this means that @xmath47  gev . at larger values of @xmath41 , @xmath48 . as we discuss at the end of sec .",
    "2.1 , this is a difficult regime to treat , as the effects of both perturbative interactions , and confinement , must be included .",
    "it is known that for a fermi liquid of dense quarks , chiral density waves lose out to color superconductivity except for very large values of the color , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this is because the chiral density waves generated by perturbative interactions are very sensitive to screening by dynamical quarks .    in sharp contrast",
    ", we expect that quarkyonic chiral density waves are much less sensitive to screening by dynamical quarks . at large @xmath1",
    ", dynamical quarks do not affect a quarkyonic phase until asymptotically large values of the chemical potential , @xmath50 .",
    "this power of @xmath51 follows either from considering the debye mass , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or the free energy , as discussed in appendix [ appendixb ] .",
    "as long as there is a quarkyonic phase , and @xmath44 , we expect that quarkyonic chiral density waves dominate .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . for quark and quark hole excitations near the fermi surface , where the magnitude of the transverse momentum @xmath52 , the theory in @xmath7 dimensions reduces to an effective model in @xmath8 dimensions @xcite .",

    "[ 2d_ferm ] we show how in @xmath8 dimensions , through an anomalous redefinition of the quark fields , a theory at nonzero chemical potential can be mapped onto the corresponding theory in vacuum .",
    "the net quark number , present in the theory at @xmath56 , is generated by the axial anomaly , as shown in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "the mapping can then be reversed : knowing results for a gauge theory in @xmath8 dimensions in vacuum , one can read off what happens in a fermi sea , @xmath56 .",
