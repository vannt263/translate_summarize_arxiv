    "the determination of scattering amplitudes between pairs of mesons is an interesting problem in strong qcd .",
    "it is also a complicated problem , because both @xmath14 annihilation to @xmath15-channel resonances and `` nonresonant '' scattering are important effects , and it is often difficult to separate the various contributions .",
    "however by specializing to annihilation - free channels such as i=2 @xmath0 and @xmath16 , i=3/2 k@xmath17 , kn and nn , one may study nonresonant scattering in relative isolation .",
    "the determination of resonance parameters , reaction mechanisms , and many other aspects of hadron physics are complicated by the presence of nonresonant scattering , which is treated as an ( often poorly understood ) initial - state and final - state rescattering effect .",
    "developing an accurate description of nonresonant scattering would help clarify many other aspects of hadron physics .",
    "a further interesting possibility is that sufficiently attractive nonresonant scattering may lead to weakly bound hadron - hadron or multihadron states , as does happen in nuclei and hypernuclei .",
    "we may also find a rich spectrum of meson - meson bound states , the study of which will extend nuclear physics into the largely unexplored field of  mesonic nuclei \" or  molecules \" @xcite .",
    "an understanding of psps , psv and other meson - meson scattering amplitudes is also important for the interpretation of non - qcd processes such as nonleptonic weak decays , since these show evidence of important hadronic final state interactions .",
    "the @xmath18i=1/2 rule is a well known example .",
    "similarly , a recent study of d and d@xmath19 decays to k@xmath20 @xcite found that the dalitz plots are dominated by two - meson isobars , including @xmath21 , k@xmath22 and k@xmath23 , and complex relative amplitudes are required to describe the d@xmath24 dalitz plot . without final state interactions one would expect relatively real couplings to these final states .",
    "one finds a surprising variety of approaches to strong hadron - hadron scattering in the literature .",
    "there are many studies using effective hadronic lagrangians , such as the  chiral perturbation theory \" description of the psps sector .",
    "although this method is convenient because it uses perturbative qft techniques , it is incomplete in that it takes effective lagrangian vertex strengths from the data ; one should be able to calculate these hadronic couplings directly from quark - gluon forces .",
    "second , there are studies that model the low energy hadron - hadron scattering mechanism , which include the apparently dissimilar meson exchange and quark - gluon descriptions of hadronic forces .",
    "meson exchange models are again attractive for their simplicity , since they use perturbative qft techniques to determine scattering amplitudes .",
    "this approach has been elaborated in greatest detail in models of the nn force @xcite , in which a large number of meson exchanges is assumed . with this large parameter space",
    "a good description of this interaction is possible , although there is a concern that one may be parametrizing other scattering mechanisms in addition to @xmath25-channel meson exchange .",
    "alternatively , one may calculate hadron - hadron forces directly from the fundamental quark - gluon interaction , using quark model hadron wavefunctions .",
    "this approach has also seen its most detailed development in studies of the nn interaction @xcite , and is most successful in describing the short - ranged repulsive core .",
    "maltman and isgur @xcite also found a physically reasonable intermediate ranged attraction from a color van der waals effect in the quark - gluon approach , which is _ not _ equivalent to the usual @xmath0 or @xmath26 meson exchange explanation of this force .",
    "the quark description of hadron - hadron interactions is complicated by the combinatorics of matrix elements between quark bound states , but has the advantage that it can easily be extended to a wide range of spin and flavor channels through a simple change of the external hadron wavefunctions .",
    "a third promising approach is to infer hadron scattering amplitudes from lgt .",
    "to date lgt has seen little application to scattering problems because of the difficulty of treating systems that are not in their ground states .",
    "estimates of the i=0 and i=2 @xmath0 scattering lengths have been obtained by exploiting a theoretical relation to finite - size effects @xcite , and more recently very interesting results for nuclear physics potentials in the @xmath27 system were reported @xcite . in future it may be possible to improve hadron scattering models through comparisons with similar `` lgt data '' .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the derivation of meson - meson scattering amplitudes from quark - gluon forces .",
    "we derive meson - meson scattering amplitudes at lowest order in the quark - quark interaction , which leads to a quark interchange model described by `` quark born diagrams '' @xcite .",
    "since the quark - quark interaction is already well established from hadron spectroscopy , our predictions have little parameter freedom .",
    "in previous work we and others ( usually assuming oge hyperfine dominance ) have shown that this approach gives a reasonably accurate description of s - wave scattering in a wide range of channels without @xmath14 annihilation , including i=2 @xmath0 @xcite , i=3/2 k@xmath17@xcite , i=0,1 kn@xcite , i=0,1 bb@xcite ( compared to lgt data ) , and the nn repulsive core @xcite .",
    "this approach has also been applied to @xmath28 @xcite and other reactions relevant to heavy ion collisions , where the experimental low energy cross sections are as yet unclear .",
    "the principal new contribution of this paper is a detailed analytical derivation of the meson - meson scattering amplitudes that follow from the complete quark - quark interaction , including color coulomb , linear scalar confinement , oge spin - spin , oge spin - orbit , oge tensor and linear spin - orbit forces . as a future application of these results , one might hope to clarify the relationship between meson exchange and quark interchange models by a detailed comparison of the spin dependence of hadron - hadron scattering amplitudes , which we expect to be sensitive to the details of the scattering mechanism .    here",
    "we consider both pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( psps ) and pseudoscalar - vector ( psv ) scattering .",
    "the former is a `` standard benchmark '' for meson scattering models , because i=2 @xmath0 low energy scattering has no @xmath15-channel resonances and has been the subject of many experimental phase shift analyses .",
    "although we find reasonable agreement with s - wave i=2 @xmath0 scattering , this channel has no spin degree of freedom , and so can not be used to test the characteristic spin dependences predicted by the quark model s oge and linear scalar confinement forces .",
    "we find in contrast that psv is an excellent theoretical laboratory for the study of spin - dependent forces , as it can accommodate both meson - meson spin - orbit and tensor interactions .",
    "the spin - dependent forces at the meson - meson level are closely related to the corresponding terms in the quark - quark interaction in our approach .",
    "although the study of psv scattering is essentially a theoretical exercise at present , these phase shifts are accessible experimentally , for example through measurement of the relative s and d final state phases in @xmath29 . thus it should be possible to measure psv phase shifts from resonance decays to multiamplitude psv final states .",
    "before we proceed to our detailed results , we note that some work has already appeared on meson - meson scattering in psv systems .",
    "numerical results for many light s - wave psv meson channels were previously reported by swanson @xcite using a similar quark model approach that incorporated oge spin - spin and linear confinement forces .",
    "theoretical results for psv scattering ( @xmath16 in particular ) in a meson exchange model were published by janssen _",
    "_ @xcite and bckmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , assuming @xmath17 , vector and @xmath30 exchange .",
    "since the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 vertex strengths are relatively well established , it was possible to evaluate these scattering amplitudes numerically .",
    "these papers did not consider the exotic i=2 channel , so a direct comparison with our quark model psv results is not possible at present .",
    "we approximate the full hadron - hadron scattering amplitude by a single ( born - order ) matrix element of the quark - quark interaction hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath34 is @xmath35 in color , one must then have quark line rearrangement to have a nonvanishing overlap with two color - singlet mesons in the final state . in @xmath36 scattering",
    "there are four independent born - order diagrams , which we label according to which pair of constituents interacted ; these are  transfer@xmath37 \" ( t1 ) ,  transfer@xmath38 \" ( t2 ) ,  capture@xmath37 \" ( c1 ) and  capture@xmath38 \" ( c2 ) , which are shown in fig.1 . in the special case of identical quarks",
    "_ and _ identical antiquarks , which is relevant here , there is a second set of four  symmetrizing \" diagrams t1@xmath39 c2@xmath40 , which are identical to t1@xmath41c2 except that the quark lines are interchanged rather than the antiquark lines .",
    "the hadron - hadron t - matrix element @xmath42 for each diagram can conveniently be written as an overlap integral of the meson wavefunctions times the underlying quark @xmath42 .",
    "these overlap integrals ( specializing ref.@xcite to the case of equal quark and antiquark masses ) are    @xmath43    the quark @xmath42 has momentum arguments @xmath44 , which are defined in fig.2 . in this paper",
    "we will evaluate these overlap integrals with standard gaussian quark model wavefunctions and the quark @xmath42 for the complete set of oge color coulomb , linear scalar , oge spin - spin , oge and linear scalar confinement spin - orbit and oge tensor interactions .",
    "these interactions are given in app.a .",
    "we specialize the general problem of psps scattering without @xmath14 annihilation to i=2 @xmath0 because many experiments have published phase shift analyses of this channel .",
    "the other @xmath0 channels have large @xmath15-channel @xmath14 annihilation contributions .",
    "the full i=2 @xmath0 born - order t - matrix element is determined by adding the individual contributions of app.b , with psps spin matrix elements given in app.c , part c2 .",
    "there are also flavor and color factors for each diagram and an overall  signature \" phase of @xmath45 , and a second set of  symmetrizing \" diagrams for identical quarks and identical antiquarks , as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "on summing these contributions we find    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is an abbreviation for the confluent hypergeometric ( kummer ) function @xmath48 .",
    "the three separate expressions above are the oge spin - spin , color coulomb and linear confinement contributions respectively .",
    "the @xmath49 terms come from the transfer diagrams , and the remaining , isotropic , terms come from the capture diagrams .",
    "the spin matrix elements of the spin - orbit and tensor terms vanish identically in the psps channel .    since @xmath50 and @xmath51 , one can equivalently write this amplitude as a function of the cm momentum and scattering angle using @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "the bose symmetry required for this @xmath0 scattering amplitude is evident .",
    "we may derive the elastic born - order i=2 @xmath0 phase shifts from eq.([pipit ] ) , using the relation between phase shifts and the t - matrix given in app.d , especially eq.(d17 ) , and the integrals in app.g .",
    "the result we find for the s - wave is @xmath54 where we have introduced @xmath55 .",
    "the total born - order s - wave phase shift is the sum of these three contributions .",
    "this s - wave phase shift is shown in fig.3 with our standard quark model parameter set @xmath56 , @xmath57  gev , @xmath58  gev and @xmath59  gev@xmath60 .",
    "we also use @xmath61  gev throughout .",
    "this confirms that the color coulomb and linear confinement interactions make relatively small contributions to the i=2 @xmath0 s - wave at moderate energies .",
    "the weakly repulsive linear confining interaction in i=2 @xmath0 near threshold was previously found numerically by swanson@xcite .",
    "one might be concerned about the approximation of using sho wavefunctions , especially at higher energy scales where there should be strong short - distance components in the pion wavefunction due to the attractive spin - spin hyperfine interaction . to test the sensitivity to sho wavefunctions we evaluated the i=2 @xmath0 scattering amplitudes and phase shifts numerically using coulomb plus linear plus hyperfine @xmath14 wavefunctions and monte carlo integration of the real space integrals corresponding to the t - matrix integrals ( [ t1def]-[c2def ] ) . as usual",
    "this requires a `` smearing '' of the contact hyperfine term , @xmath62 , to allow solution of the schrdinger equation with an attractive delta - function interaction . in the literature the inverse smearing length is typically taken to be @xmath63  gev .",
    "( a calculation of i=2 @xmath0 scattering with this interaction and @xmath64  gev was reported previously by swanson @xcite . ) with our standard light - quark parameter set @xmath56 , @xmath65  gev@xmath60 and @xmath66  gev , we found that fitting the @xmath67 splitting required a value of @xmath68  gev . to illustrate the dependence of the scattering amplitude on this parameter , in fig.4 we show the i=2 @xmath0 s - wave that follows from our standard quark model set @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71  gev .",
    "clearly the predicted phase shift is rather similar to the sho result of fig.3 , although the effect of short - distance peaking in the @xmath17 wavefunction is evident above @xmath72  gev .",
    "we also show most of the higher statistics experimental results for the i=2 @xmath0 s - wave phase shift in figs.3 and 4 .",
    "the references shown are colton _ et al._@xcite , durusoy _ et al._@xcite ( ope extrapolation , solid ; ope + dp form factor , open , slightly displaced in @xmath73 for visibiity ) , hoogland _ et al._@xcite ( extrapolation b ) , and losty _ et al._@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite found a wide range of results from three different off - shell extrapolations , so we simply quote their fitted scattering length below .",
    "clearly there is already reasonable agreement with the experimental s - wave phase shift at lower energies without fitting the quark model parameters .",
    "the model predicts a rather dramatic extremum in this phase shift near @xmath74  gev , which is unfortunately beyond the limiting invariant mass of most of the experimental studies .",
    "there are some measurements of this phase shift at higher invariant mass with lower accuracy due to durusoy _",
    "et al._@xcite , which are also shown in the figure .",
    "the durusoy _",
    "_ results support our predicted extremum near @xmath74  gev ; indeed , their phase shift above @xmath74  gev appears to fall even more rapidly than we predict .",
    "we have investigated optimal parameter fits of the s - wave phase shift formula eq.(6 ) to the data , but we find that these are rather unstable because the color coulomb and linear confinement contributions are small and are qualitatively similar functions . in any case",
    "the durusoy _",

    "the difficulty of extrapolating experimental phase shifts to threshold has been stressed by morgan and pennington @xcite .",
    "we advocate the use of a  generalized specific heat plot \" of low energy phase shifts for this purpose @xcite .",
    "this plot takes into account the threshold behavior seen in eq.(6 ) , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a relatively slowly varying function of @xmath90 .",
    "thus the threshold behavior is approximately proportional to @xmath91 rather than just @xmath92 , and since @xmath93 is quite small this leads to rapid variation near threshold and makes the linear-@xmath92 extrapolation inaccurate .",
    "we suggest removal of all this dependence by displaying @xmath94 versus @xmath1 .",
    "the intercept in this plot is the scattering length , and the slope at intercept implies the effective range .",
    "this generalized specific heat plot is shown in fig.5 for i=2 @xmath0 scattering .",
    "an extrapolation of the moderate-@xmath92 data can now be seen to be much closer to the theoretical scattering lengths .",
    "the small-@xmath92 dependence of @xmath95 was calculated by donoghue @xcite in a chiral effective lagrangian , which gave the weinberg result at @xmath96 and an @xmath97 correction factor of @xmath98 .",
    "this is just the correction due to an overall factor of @xmath99 , so this predicts a zero slope in @xmath1 for @xmath94 at threshold .    the jlich meson - exchange model @xcite , which is dominated by @xmath25-channel @xmath100 exchange in this process , also predicts rapid variation in @xmath95 near threshold .",

    "we quote separate gaussians for the transfer and capture contributions from each of the three interactions , spin - spin contact , color coulomb and linear hyperfine .",
    "however their predicted phase shift decays more slowly at large momentum , probably due to the use of power law form factors in their vertices .",
    "@xmath102    in ref.@xcite we derived i=2 @xmath0 potentials for the spin - spin contact interaction using the  locality expansion \" method of ref.@xcite .",
    "this gave an identical result for the spin - spin transfer potential , because this amplitude ( before bose symmetrization ) is a function of @xmath25 only .",
    "however for the capture diagrams the mott - massey approach used here gives a different potential , since it is constrained to reproduce the @xmath103 series expansion of the phase shift in eq.(6 ) , but the local approximation is not .",
    "the two capture potentials reproduce the scattering length , but the local approximation gives an incorrect effective range .    the low energy mott - massey i=2 @xmath0 potential is shown in fig.6 for our standard quark model parameters @xmath56 , @xmath65  gev@xmath60 and @xmath66  gev .",
    "the spin - spin hyperfine contribution is dominant over the range shown .",

    "we have also evaluated this d - wave phase shift using coulomb plus linear plus hyperfine wavefunctions .",
    "the result is shown in fig.4 , and is numerically similar to the sho d - wave , eq.(14 ) .    in comparison the experimental d - waves reported by durusoy _",
