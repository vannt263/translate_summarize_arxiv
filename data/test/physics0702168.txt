    "a basic fact of life is competition . in evolution , only the fittest survive ; in the workplace , we compete for professional advancement ; in social events , we compete for attention ; in sports , its very purpose is to excel in competition .",
    "idealized models of social competition have recently been proposed in which the status of each individual is determined by competitive success @xcite . in this spirit",
    ", we introduce a simple `` rate - race '' model that embodies the struggle for advancement in a competitive environment .",
    "because everyone is engaged in the same perpetual rat race , one s relative standing may change slowly or not at all , even though the population as a whole may be advancing . when the competition favors the strong",
    ", the leader runs away from the rest of the population .",
    "as the competition becomes more equitable , in any typical realization of the system , everyone reaches the same fitness and the population become static . when the leader is easily overtaken , the mean fitness undergoes periods of near stasis and explosive advancement that qualitatively mirrors the phenomenon of punctuated evolution @xcite .",
    "empirical motivations for our model come from evolution and from sports . in evolution ,",
    "large - scale species extinctions occur during sudden spurts , with much slower development during the intervening periods @xcite .",
    "these periods of near stasis characterize many sports , where it is not possible to maintain a long - term competitive advantage .",
    "if one finds such a winning strategy , competitors will eventually find a counter - strategy so that any advantage is lost .",
    "conversely , a consistent loser will be replaced by a more competent individual so that losing strategies also do not persist .",
    "a famous example of the latter idea comes from baseball , where the mythic achievement of a .400 hitter , an exceptional player who gets a hit in more than 40% of his turns at bat , occurred multiple times during the early years of the sport25 times from 1871 to 1941 ( last accomplished by the .406 batting average of ted williams of the boston red sox in 1941)but none since then .",
    "an appealing explanation for this phenomenon , proposed by s. j. gould @xcite , is that the increasing competitiveness as the sport has developed makes outliers less likely to occur . to illustrate this point",
    ", gould found that the dispersion in the batting averages of all regular players decreased systematically from 1875 until 1980 , even though year - to - year fluctuations in their mean batting average are larger than the systematic decrease in the dispersion .",
    "thus outliers become rarer and exceptional achievements , such as a season batting average over .400 , or a consecutive - game hitting streak longer than 56 achieved by joe dimaggio also in 1941 , should not recur .    in the next section ,",
    "we define the rat race model and then we analytically determine its dynamical features for a two - agent system in sec .",
    "[ 2c ] . in sec .",
    "[ det ] , we investigate many agents in the framework of an almost deterministic version of the rat race .",
    "simulation results for the evolutionary behavior of the model are given in sec .",

    "in our rat race model , each individual @xmath0 possesses a real - valued fitness @xmath1 , with larger @xmath1 representing higher fitness ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "an individual attempts to improve with respect to the competition by advancing to larger @xmath2 .",
    "advancement events occur one at a time and each individual has the same rate of advancing ; _",
    "i.e. _ , we consider _ serial _ dynamics in which a randomly - selected competitor advances .",
    "the leader , located at @xmath3 , advances by an amount that is drawn from a uniform distribution of width @xmath4 .",
    "that is , the leader is aware only of the next strongest individual and attempts to maintain its lead by advancing by an amount that is of the order of the separation to this nearest neighbor . on the other hand , all other individuals seek to overtake the leader .",
    "the @xmath5 agent , with fitness @xmath1 , moves a distance that is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the fundamental parameter  the `` catch - up '' factor  that quantifies the severity of the competition . when @xmath8 , the leader maintains the lead forever , while for @xmath9 the leader can be overtaken .    .",

    "the @xmath10 particle can advance by an amount that is uniformly distributed in @xmath11.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in the context of competition , it would be more realistic to eliminate laggards and replace them by typical individuals .",
    "however , our model mimics precisely this situation , as a laggard typically moves toward the average fitness .",
    "a lazy population is characterized by a small value of @xmath7 for which the leader maintains the lead on the rest of the pack . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath7 , however , the lead changes often and by large amounts so that the width of the fitness distribution increases after each advancement event . between these two extremes",
    "there is an intermediate regime of stasis where the spread of the pack shrinks to zero and the population stops advancing .",
    "we begin by studying the case of two agents with fitnesses @xmath3 and @xmath12 and gap @xmath13 .",
    "the fitness of the leader increases by an amount that is uniformly distributed in @xmath14 $ ] to try to maintain its lead .",
    "similarly , the laggard advances by a distance that is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath8 the agents always maintain their order , while for @xmath9 lead changes can occur .",
    "we now determine the evolution of the gap length for any @xmath7 .",
    "the gap length undergoes a random multiplicative process because each advancement step leads to a multiplicative change .",
    "thus we expect that the distribution of gap lengths for an ensemble of two - agent systems will have a log - normal form . additionally , over a suitable range for the catch - up factor @xmath7 we also expect large fluctuations between different realizations of the process , as is well - known to occur in random multiplicative processes @xcite .",

[ gap ] ) .",
    "the second term accounts for the creation of a gap of length @xmath16 due to the leader advancing from a previous gap of length @xmath21 ( fig .  [ gap](c ) ) .",

    "employing the same interchange of integration order as illustrated above , the integrals can be evaluated straightforwardly to yield the following closed equations for the moments : @xmath37    for @xmath8 , the first few moments obey : @xmath38 _ etc_. all positive integer moments increase in time for @xmath8 because the leader hops further than the laggard , on average , in every single event .",
    "conversely , for @xmath9 the corresponding moment equations are : @xmath39\\nonumber \\\\ \\dot { \\mathcal{m}_2 } & = &    \\mathcal{m}_2\\left[\\frac{(m-1)^3+m+1}{6m}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ etc_. curiously , different moments can have opposite time dependences . for @xmath8",
    "the laggard trails further and further behind after each step and the average separation grows , while for @xmath40 , overtaking events are so drastic in character that the average separation between the two agents also grows .",
    "conversely , for @xmath41 , the first moment decreases in time . in spite of the differing behaviors for the first moment as a function of @xmath7 , higher moments grow for any @xmath9 ( eq .  ) .    why does this dichotomy between moments of different order arise ?",
    "the source is the multiplicative process that underlies the gap dynamics .",
    "this multiplicativity leads to the very broad _ log - normal _ distribution of gap sizes ( to be derived in the next section ) , for which the time dependence of moments of different order can be quite different @xcite . in a random multiplicative process , extreme realizations with an exponentially small probability , make an exponentially large contribution to the moment of a given order . for @xmath8 or @xmath40",
    ", the interplay between these two extremes leads to a first moment that grows with time when summing over all realizations . in simulations , however , we study only a small fraction of all realizations and thus can observe only the very different _ most probable _ behavior .",
    "the most probable gap @xmath42 ( the geometric average of @xmath16 ) may be obtained by computing @xmath43 , using the same approach that leads from eq .",
    "we thereby find that @xmath44 with @xmath45 setting @xmath46 gives the transition at which the most probable gap length does not change .",
    "again there are two transitions ; from the first line of , the condition @xmath46 gives a transcendental equation for @xmath7 with solution @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , from the second line of , the condition @xmath46 gives the threshold @xmath48 .",
    "the most probable gap length @xmath49 thus increases with time for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , while @xmath49 shrinks to zero in a finite time for @xmath52 .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "& , there exists a range of @xmath7 for which the average gap grows while the most probable gap shrinks .",
    "again , the interplay between exponentially unlikely events that have exponentially large contributions to an observable gives seemingly contradictory results that are natural outcomes of a random multiplicative process @xcite .",
    "we now compute the asymptotic tails of the gap length distribution itself . our approach to determine this distribution is to write the moments of the gap length distribution in eqs .   as a fourier transform and then invert this transform .",
    "thus we write @xmath53}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now define @xmath54 and make an analytic continuation from @xmath55 to @xmath56 to give @xmath57}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the left - hand side is just the fourier transform of @xmath58 . inverting this fourier transform , we obtain @xmath59}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to derive the asymptotic distribution for large @xmath60 , we need the small-@xmath55 behavior of @xmath61 . using , we expand @xmath62 for small @xmath55 and then invert the fourier transform to obtain a gaussian distribution for @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a log - normal distribution for @xmath16 .",
    "the final result is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is given by eq .   and @xmath65 & m < 1 \\\\ \\\\",
    "c - \\frac{m-1}{2m}\\left[2\\ln(m-1 ) - \\ln^2(m-1)\\right ] &   m > 1 , \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 .",
    "we again emphasize that while the distribution of @xmath67 extends over range that grows as @xmath68 , the distribution of @xmath16 itself is extremely broad so that it can not be characterized by any individual moment .",
    "it is not clear how to adapt the theory given above in an analytically - tractable way to treat more than 2 particles .",
    "we therefore introduce an nearly - deterministic version of the model that mimics the advancement steps in the stochastic rat race model by defining the length of each jump to be exactly one half of the total possible range .",
    "we again consider serial dynamics in which one of the competitors , chosen at random , advances .",
    "the order in which competitors are selected is the only source of stochasticity in this version of the model .",
    "there are two possibilities for particle movement , depending on the value of the catch - up factor @xmath7 :    * for @xmath69 , if the leader moves , the gap @xmath70 , while if the laggard moves , the gap @xmath71 , where @xmath72 . * for @xmath40 the laggard overtakes the leader . if the leader moves , again @xmath70 , while if the laggard moves @xmath71 , where @xmath73 .",
    "since either particle is selected with probability 1/2 at each step , after @xmath18 steps the gap could assume any of the values @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( assuming an initial gap length @xmath76 ) .",
    "after @xmath18 steps , the probability of a gap of length @xmath74 is @xmath77    . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the order never changes , while for @xmath40 , the move of the laggard always leads to passing.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it follows that the @xmath10 moment of the gap length is @xmath78^t\\,.\\ ] ] thus , the large - time behavior of the @xmath10 moment depends on the factor @xmath79/2 $ ] . if this factor is greater than @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath81 exceeds @xmath82 $ ] , the @xmath83 moment diverges as @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath85 , the @xmath10 moment vanishes as @xmath84 . for @xmath86 , _ all _ positive moments of the gap size , as well as the most probable gap size , diverge .",
    "the value @xmath87 thus marks the transition from convergent to explosive behavior in the gap size .",
    "notice that this transition value for @xmath81 corresponds to the threshold values @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which agree well with the corresponding thresholds from the stochastic rat race .",
    "we study an @xmath90-particle system , with @xmath91 , with particles located at @xmath1 , with @xmath92 .",
    "the gap between particle @xmath93 and the leader is defined as @xmath94 .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of catch - up factor @xmath40 , so that any non - leader that jumps always overtakes the leader .",
    "this fact allows us to keep track of the ordering of the particles and an exact analysis is then possible . for generality",
    ", we assume the leader jumps a distance @xmath95 ahead ; @xmath96 corresponds to the case analyzed previously , while for @xmath97 the leader is completely lazy and never jumps .",
    "if particle @xmath93 is selected , this results in a re - distribution of the vector @xmath98 of the gap lengths : @xmath99 where @xmath100 @xmath101 the vector , after @xmath18 steps , is the result of the product of @xmath18 matrices , drawn at random from among the @xmath102 . unfortunately",
    ", none of the matrices commute , so we can not deduce the probability distribution of gap sizes as in the scalar case of two particles ( @xmath103 ) . on the other hand , according to the oseledec theorem @xcite ( also known as the multiplicative ergodic theorem ) , the growth of  is determined by the product @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath102 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "more precisely , the product @xmath107 determines the largest lyapunov exponent of the growth of  with @xmath108 .",
    "thus explosive growth results if the product @xmath109 , and stasis results otherwise .",

    "we argue , self - consistently , that for @xmath118 these are also the largest eigenvalues , that is , @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , if that is the case , then the criticality condition dictates @xmath120 . substituting this value into the characteristic equation for @xmath121 we find @xmath122 it follows that @xmath123 ( with the equality being realized in the limit @xmath124 ) .",
    "we can now show that our initial assumption that the remaining eigenvalues of @xmath102 ( @xmath118 ) are not larger than 1 is indeed valid . from the factor in the square brackets of the characteristic equation",
    ", we see that these eigenvalues satisfy @xmath125 the expression on the right - hand side is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath126 , hence if @xmath127 then @xmath128 , in contradiction with  ( [ bc_a>0 ] ) .    for @xmath97 , namely , the case of a lazy leader that never advances as long as it leads , the critical value of the catch - up parameter @xmath81 is no longer exponential in @xmath108 , but rather @xmath129 as can be seen by taking the limit of @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ bc_a>0 ] ) .",
    "for any number of agents , the time dependence of the fitness of each agent exhibits rich behavior . for 2 agents , simulations clearly show a transition between a regime where the leader runs away from the laggard and stasis as @xmath7 passes through a critical value close to @xmath47 .",
    "this stasis continues until a second transition at @xmath130 . for @xmath131",
    ", there is explosive growth , with many lead changes between the two agents .",
    "it bears emphasizing that the observed transitions occur close to the values associated with the most probable gap size , even though the true transitions occur at @xmath132 and @xmath133 , corresponding to the average gap size .",

    "we introduced an idealized social competition model where individuals try to better their fitness ( a real - valued variable ) by advancing relative to the rest of the population : the leader advances to remain ahead of its closest pursuer , while others in the pack advance by a random amount , in proportion to their distance from the leader .",
    "when this proportionality constant is too small or too large , the fitness of all the agents grows explosively during short sporadic bursts .",
    "these explosive regimes are the analog of the rapid growth of new species after massive die - offs in punctuated evolution . between these two extremes",
    "there is a window of stasis , where the spread of the pack shrinks indefinitely and evolution comes to a stop .",
    "here outliers becomes progressively less likely and extreme achievements disappear ; this situation parallels the disappearance of the .400 hitter in baseball mentioned in the introduction .",
    "basic features of the model already arise in the simple limits of just two agents , and in a deterministic model where agents advance by a fixed multiple of their gap to the leader .",
    "these simplified models allow for an exact analysis , yielding specific expressions for the distribution of gaps in the two - agent model , and for the @xmath108-dependence of the threshold parameters that demarcate between the regimes of stasis and explosive growth in the deterministic model .",
    "our simulation results suggest that similar behavior occurs for a general many - agent system .",
    "a full analytical solution of the general many - agent problem seems intractable , however , even in the simplified deterministic version .",
    "thus some basic questions remain unanswered , such as , for example , what is the distribution of agents in the pack in the various regimes of explosive growth , stasis , and at the critical transition points .",
