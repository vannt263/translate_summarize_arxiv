    "the last decade has seen a renewed interest in perturbative quantum field theory ( pqft ) . on the one hand , progress has been achieved on amplitudes with many legs and a low number of loops ( zero or one ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( and the references therein ) . from an experimentalist point of view",
    "these results are vital for the analysis of , e.g. , the lhc - data . on the other hand",
    "the study of many loops with a low number of external legs is important for the understanding of high precision experiments like the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this article focuses on the first aspect of pqft .",
    "because of their immediate relevance for physical predictions one - loop amplitudes have attracted much attention . in the 1960s",
    "it was observed that the complexity of the amplitude saturates when the number of external particles exceeds the dimension of space - time @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in 1965",
    "petersson @xcite found the residue - type reduction formula eq .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) , @xmath4 which reduces the number of propagators @xmath5 in the integral to the space - time dimension @xmath6 at the expense of a pre - factor which is a rational function in the momenta and masses of the particles .",
    "at the same time it was observed that in space - time dimensions two and three the amplitude is given by logarithms of algebraic functions in the momenta and masses @xcite , @xcite . in space - time dimension four",
    "( and five ) one needs dilogarithms to express the amplitude @xcite ( for a modern mathematical account see @xcite ) . only in 1998",
    "it was observed by davydychev and delbourgo that the simplicity of the results can be understood in a geometrical language : the amplitudes are volumes of tetrahedra in  depending on the masses and momenta  spherical or hyperbolic geometries @xcite . in this article",
    "we show that one obtains a unified hyperbolic picture if one works in euclidean instead of lorentzean space - time . for @xmath6 external particles in @xmath6 space - time dimensions one obtains eq .",

    "their vectors span an ( @xmath3)-dimensional tetrahedron ( in three dimensions they are the sides of a triangle ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , in four dimensions they form a cycle of four edges that spans a tetrahedron ) .",
    "this tetrahedron is @xmath8 in the projective hyperbolic model ( where geodesics are straight lines ) .",
    "the location of the sphere at infinity is determined by the masses of the internal particles .",
    "if the particles are massless the sphere at infinity is spanned by the vertices of the ( then ideal ) tetrahedron . with this picture",
    "one can rephrase the above formula entirely in terms of geometrical quantities , basically as the ratio of the hyperbolic over the euclidean volume of @xmath8 , eq .",

[ step5 ] for a precise statement ) . because ideal tetrahedra correspond to massless particles any one - loop amplitude of massive particles in even - dimensional space - time can be expressed in terms of one - loop amplitudes of massless particles ( whose external momenta are algebraic functions of the masses and momenta of the original particles ) .",
    "the aim of this article is to present the above results in a unified geometric framework .",
    "the necessary algebra is organized in 5 elementary steps which are fully explained and elaborated .",
    "we end this article by the short example of a massive two - loop amplitude in two dimensions which shows that beyond the one - loop level polylogarithms are in general replaced by elliptic or even more complicated polylogarithms .",
    "a hyperbolic interpretation of general two loop amplitudes is hence not possible .",

    "this makes the momenta complex and the bloch - wigner dilogarithm is known to give the ( signed ) volume of the ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron which is spanned by the momenta @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 in the half - space model of hyperbolic geometry . in this model the sphere at infinity degenerates to the complex plane spanned by the momenta .",

    "( [ 46 ] ) implies that the hyperbolic interpretation still holds for any quaternionic momenta . in the general case",
    "the momenta @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 span a two - dimensional sphere which defines the sphere at infinity of a three - dimensional hyperbolic space .",
    "in the projective model the edges of the tetrahedron are the straight lines @xmath43 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
