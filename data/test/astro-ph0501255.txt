    "rxj0806.3 + 1527 is a remarkable object discovered during the rosat all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "its soft x - ray flux is @xmath0 100% modulated with a period of 321.54s @xcite .",
    "if this is the orbital period of a double - degenerate close binary system as suggested by @xcite and @xcite it would lie close to the theoretical minimum period of white dwarf binaries and would imply the presence of a he - rich donor star .",
    "the spectral energy distributions in the optical and x - ray windows reveal two distinct components with black body temperatures of @xmath040000k and @xmath0750000k which could be attributed to the donor star or an accretion disk and to an accretion spot on the primary , respectively @xcite . as a crucial test to distinguish between the double - degenerate scenario and competing models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for rxj0806.3 + 1527 we have started an abundance analysis of the optical spectrum presented by @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of rxj0806.3 + 1527 obtained with fors1 at the eso vlt shows a composite of a blue continuum and superimposed emission lines of the heii pickering series and , possibly , the h balmer series . for the spectral analysis",
    ", we utilize a grid of theoretical spectra calculated with an nlte model atmosphere code for white dwarf photospheres with a range of effective temperatures @xmath1 , @xmath2 abundance ratios , and isotropic irradiation @xcite . here",
    ", we present a study of the influence of the three main parameters on the spectrum .      in our models ,",
    "irradiation is treated as black body emission with effective temperature @xmath3k from a spherically symmetric shell around a white dwarf with @xmath4k and an abundance ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the distance between the irradiating source and the photosphere is represented by a free `` illumination '' parameter @xmath6 .",
    "it has been varied from @xmath7 to @xmath8 with a more detailed study in the parameter range which leads to the occurrence of significant emission lines in the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illumination_parameter ] ) . depending on @xmath6 ,",
    "our models produce three phenomenologically different types of spectra :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < , < \" , ]      in order to estimate the chemical composition of rxj0806.3 + 1527 we have calculated models with different @xmath2 abundance ratios between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the irradiation and photospheric temperatures have been fixed at @xmath3k and @xmath4k , respectively , and the illumination parameter has been set to @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abundance_ratio ] ) .    based on our analysis",
    ", we can reject he - deficient atmospheres , @xmath12 , as well as models with strong he overabundances , @xmath13 .",
    "the latter fail to reproduce the observed spectrum , especially around the heii @xmath14",
    "4540  line .",
    "proper fits to the observational data can be obtained with abundances @xmath15 .      as a third parameter",
    ", we varied the effective temperature of the illuminated photosphere in the range @xmath16k @xmath17k with fixed parameters @xmath11 and @xmath5 ( see figure [ fig : effective_temperature ] ) .",
    "our models show that photospheric temperatures between 30000k and 35000k seem to be more realistic than higher temperatures , in agreement with the overall spectral energy distribution of rxj0806.3 + 1527 .",
    "our parameter study has shown that the optical spectrum of rxj0806.3 + 1527 can be quantitatively reproduced with our irradiated white dwarf atmosphere model . the model spectra provide some evidence against a he - white dwarf nature of the donor star implied by the double - degenerate binary scenario .",
    "noting that illumination is the dominant effect in modeling the optical spectrum of rxj0806.3 + 1527 , our approach of an isotropic irradiation of a high - gravity atmosphere may , however , be too simplistic .",
    "further work will be required to investigate models with non - isotropical irradiation and irradiated accretion disks .",
