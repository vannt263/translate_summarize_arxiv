    "we have recently given a combinatorial model for the irreducible characters of a complex semisimple lie group @xmath1 , and , more generally , for the demazure characters @xcite .",
    "this model was defined in the context of the equivariant @xmath2-theory of the generalized flag variety @xmath3 .",
    "our character formulas were derived from a chevalley - type formula in @xmath4 .",
    "our model was based on enumerating certain saturated chains in the bruhat order on the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 .",
    "this enumeration is determined by an alcove path , which is a sequence of adjacent alcoves for the affine weyl group @xmath6 of the langland s dual group @xmath7 .",
    "alcove paths correspond to decompositions of elements in the affine weyl group .",
    "our chevalley - type formula was was expressed in terms of a certain @xmath8-matrix , that is , in terms of a collection of operators satisfying the yang - baxter equation .",
    "this setup allowed us to easily explain the independence of our formulas from the choice of an alcove path .",
    "there are other models for chevalley - type formulas in @xmath4 and for the characters of the irreducible representations of @xmath1 with highest weight @xmath0 , such as the littelmann path model .",
    "littelmann  @xcite showed that the characters can be described by counting certain continuous paths in @xmath9 .",
    "these paths are constructed recursively , by starting with an initial one , and by applying certain root operators . by making specific choices for the initial path",
    ", one can obtain special cases which have more explicit descriptions .",
    "for instance , a straight line initial path leads to the lakshmibai - seshadri paths ( ls paths ) .",
    "these were introduced before littelmann s work , in the context of standard monomial theory  @xcite .",
    "they have a nonrecursive description as weighted chains in the bruhat order on the quotient @xmath10 of the corresponding weyl group @xmath5 modulo the stabilizer @xmath11 of the weight @xmath0 ; therefore , we will use the term ls chains when referring to this description .",
    "ls paths were used by pittie and ram @xcite to derive a @xmath12-chevalley formula .",
    "recently , gaussent and littelmann  @xcite , motivated by the study of mirkovi - vilonen cycles , defined another combinatorial model for the irreducible characters of a complex semisimple lie group .",
    "this model is based on ls - galleries , which are certain sequences of faces of alcoves for the corresponding affine weyl group . according to @xcite , for each ls - gallery there is an associated littelmann path and a saturated chain in the bruhat order on @xmath10 . our alcove path model from  @xcite and ls - galleries , which were developed independently ,",
    "can be related to each other in the case of regular weights .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to extend the model introduced in @xcite from semisimple lie algebras to complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebras . instead of alcove paths ( that make sense only in finite types ) ,",
    "the present paper is based on @xmath0-chains , which are chains of positive roots defined by certain interlacing conditions .",
    "these new objects extend the notion of a reflection ordering @xcite , and have many interesting combinatorial properties , some of which are investigated in this paper .",
    "the extension from the finite to the infinite case is nontrivial since the description in terms of the affine weyl groups and alcoves is no longer available in the latter case .",
    "compared to the geometric approach in @xcite ( involving the equivariant @xmath2-theory of @xmath3 ) , the generalization in this paper is carried out purely in the context of representation theory , and , in this process , new features of our model are added .",
    "for instance , we define root operators in our model , and study their properties .",
    "this allows us to show that our model satisfies the axioms of an admissible system of stembridge @xcite .",
    "thus , we easily derive character formulas , a littlewood - richardson rule for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations , as well as a branching rule . the approach via admissible systems was already applied to ls chains in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) .",
    "stembridge s approach has the advantage of making a part of the proof independent of a particular model for weyl characters , by using a system of axioms for such models .",
    "the root operators in our model define certain colored graph structures which we call semiperfect crystals . in the case of a special @xmath0-chain",
    ", we show that our model gives rise to ls paths ( which are also defined in the kac - moody setup ) via a certain process of passing to the limit .",
    "it then follows that the semiperfect crystals for the special @xmath0-chain coincide with kashiwara s crystals ( called here perfect crystals ) of the corresponding irreducible integrable highest weight modules @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the independence of our model from the choice of a @xmath0-chain was proved in @xcite in the finite case .",
    "hence , in this case , we know that our semiperfect crystals are perfect crystals for any choice of a @xmath0-chain .",
    "we briefly discuss the relationship between our model and the littelmann path model ( in the kac - moody setup ) .",
    "the former is a discrete counterpart of the latter without being simply a translation of it into a different language .",
    "let us explain .",
    "both models are based on certain choices ( of a @xmath0-chain and of an initial path , respectively ) .",
    "however , in its full generality , the path model is a recursive one , as explained above , whereas ours is a nonrecursive one .",
    "the definition of root operators in our model always involves reflecting a single segment in a @xmath0-chain , whereas several segments of a path might be reflected in the path model ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : finite ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we have a generalization of the left - key construction of lascoux - schtzenberger ( relevant to demazure characters , cf .",
    "remark [ lskey ] ) in our model for any choice of a @xmath0-chain , whereas , in the path model , a similar generalization exists only for ls paths .",
    "although ls paths can be derived from our model , as explained above , the two are not equivalent either .",
    "indeed , certain information is lost in the process of passing to the limit , namely the order in which certain hyperplanes are crossed , when a path is deformed into one which passes through the intersection of these hyperplanes .",
    "( in some cases , such as the one related to the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite , the lost information needs to be recovered , but this is done by a nontrivial lift from @xmath10 to @xmath5 ; the @xmath12-chevalley formula in @xcite based on our model obviates this lift . )    the main advantage of our model is related to its combinatorial nature .",
    "this model is computationally efficient because it uses simple labels for the vertices of an irreducible crystal , namely certain finite sets of positive integers ( called admissible subsets ) ; these can be efficiently constructed .",
    "although a @xmath0-chain might be an infinite object , we do not need to store it , since we always work with a finite set of objects ( cf .",
    "remark [ finiteness ] ) .",
    "more precisely , all we need is a procedure for comparing two elements in a @xmath0-chain , namely two pairs , each consisting of a positive root and a nonnegative integer ( see proposition [ constr - lambdachain ] for a simple procedure of this type ) .",
    "let us also note that our model is equally simple for both regular and nonregular highest weights @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , instead of working with chains of cosets in @xmath10 ( as in the case of ls chains ) or with possibly lower dimensional faces of alcoves ( as in the case of ls - galleries ) , we always work with chains in @xmath5 and , in the finite case , with alcoves too . compared to ls chains and ls - galleries",
    ", we also eliminate the need for making extra choices after the initial choice ( of an initial path , of a sequence of alcoves / lower dimensional faces of them , or of a @xmath0-chain ) .",
    "unlike ls - galleries , our model extends to the kac - moody case .",
    "finally , it leads to an extensive generalization of the combinatorics of irreducible characters from lie type @xmath13 ( where the combinatorics is based on young tableaux ) to arbitrary type .",
    "for example , an alcove path analog of schtzenberger s evacuation is given in @xcite .",
    "the study of the combinatorics of our model will be continued in future publications .",
    "let us now present our combinatorial formula for characters . fix a complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebra @xmath14 ; see  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be the associated set of positive real roots .",
    "for a root @xmath16 , let @xmath17 be the corresponding coroot .",
    "let @xmath0 be a dominant integral weight , and let @xmath18 be the associated irreducible representation of @xmath14 with the highest weight @xmath0 .",
    "we define a @xmath0-chain ( of roots ) @xmath19 as a map @xmath20 , @xmath21 , from a totally ordered index set @xmath22 to positive roots , that satisfies the conditions below ; given @xmath23 and @xmath16 , we use the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    1 .   for a root @xmath16 ,",
