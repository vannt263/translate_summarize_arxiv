    "we study here the computation of structures considered as waveguides , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , with symmetries which can be a translation ( a ) , a rotation ( b ) or a periodicity ( c ) .",
    "thus these waveguides can be uniform or periodic .",
    "the vibration of such waveguides has been the topic of much research .",
    "one can find analytical or finite element models of waveguides and people are generally interested by the computation of wave propagations and dispersion curves or by the determination of the frequency response functions .",
    "a first approach considers structures with constant cross sections as the cases a ) and b ) of figure 1 .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite used a wave approach to study the vibrations of structural networks composed of simple uniform beams , and solved for the dynamics of individual elements and of the junctions between elements by analytical methods . the efficiency is greatly improved compared to fe methods as a beam can be modelled using only a single element .",
    "the first numerical approaches were proposed by @xcite to approximate the cross - sectional deformations by finite elements .",
    "the authors of @xcite applied similar ideas to the calculation of wave propagations in rails using a finite element model of the cross - section of a rail .",
    "they then calculated dispersion relations and accelerances .",
    "dispersion relations for elastic waves in helical waveguides were also considered by @xcite .",
    "for general waveguides with a complex cross - section , the displacements in the cross - section can be described by the finite element method while the variation along the axis of symmetry is expressed as a wave function . following these ideas",
    ", @xcite developed the spectral finite element approach .",
    "this leads to efficient computations of dispersion relations and transfer functions but special elements need to be developed for each element type .",
    "this makes the connection with the standard use of the finite element method difficult and does not allow the benefits of powerful existing finite element software to be exploited .",
    "similar techniques were also developed by @xcite for the computation of dispersion relations in damped waveguides .",
    "more general waveguides can be studied by considering periodic structures .",
    "numerous works provided interesting theoretical insights in the behaviour of these structures , see for instance the work of @xcite and the review paper by @xcite .",
    "mead also presented a general theory for wave propagation in periodic systems in @xcite .",
    "he showed that the solution can be decomposed into an equal number of positive and negative - going waves . the approach is mainly based on floquet s principle or the transfer matrix and the objective it to compute propagation constants relating the forces and displacements on the two sides of a cell ( a single period ) and the waves associated to these constants . for complex structures",
    "fe models are used for the computation of the propagation constants and waves .",
    "the final objective is to compute dispersion relations to use them in energetic methods , see @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the general dynamic stiffness matrix for a periodic structure was found from the propagation constants and waves .",
    "it leads to a matrix linking the extreme sides of the structure and allows to compute transfer functions in the structure .",
    "the last approach is purely computational and uses rotational and cyclic symmetries to solve the problem by a decomposition of the displacements in cosine and sine functions .",
    "it is thus possible to find the transfer functions or modal shapes for periodic structures .",
    "a review of the current practises can be found in @xcite .",
    "these methods allow computing the frequency response functions in a number of operations proportional to the number of cells in the structure .",
    "this paper develops this last approach and presents a recursive method to calculate the forced response of structures such as those illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "a section of the waveguide is modelled using conventional fe methods , using a commercial fe package .",
    "the resulting mass , stiffness and damping matrices are then post - processed to give the dynamic stiffness matrix of the cell .",
    "then a recursive method is applied to compute the global dynamic stiffness matrix of the whole waveguide and finally the transfer functions in the structure .",
    "this paper presents a different approach from the previously published paper @xcite .",
    "both papers aim at computing the global dynamic stiffness matrix of a n cells structure .",
    "but in @xcite waves in a period were computed and from these waves the dynamic stiffness matrix of a complete structure was obtained with a computational cost independent of the number of periods in the structure .",
    "however the computation of the waves can be time consuming when the number of dofs in a section is large because this needs the computation of eigenvalues of non symmetric matrices .",
    "on the contrary , in the present approach no wave needs to be computed and the global dynamic stiffness matrix is obtained by products and inverses of matrices with the same dimensions as the dynamic stiffness matrix of a cell .",
    "then , the frequency response functions can be obtained easily without the computation of any wave .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts . in the first part",
    "the recursive method for the finite element analysis of periodic structures is presented . in the second part",
    "two examples consisting in a beam and a plate are described before the conclusion .",
    "consider a periodic structure , as shown in figure [ fig2 ] , which is made of a large number @xmath1 of cells .",
    "we are interested by the computation of the frequency response function for a point force excitation @xmath2 somewhere in the structure and a response @xmath3 at another point .",
    "we propose here an efficient method to compute this function by using a recursive approach to get the dynamic stiffness matrix of different sets of cells .",
    "consider first the case of only one cell .",
    "the discrete dynamic equation of a cell obtained from a fe model at a frequency @xmath4 and for the time dependence @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the stiffness , mass and damping matrices , respectively , @xmath10 is the loading vector and @xmath11 the vector of the degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .",
    "a viscous damping is considered here but the same results could be obtained with other damping models . introducing the dynamic stiffness matrix @xmath12 , decomposing the dofs into boundary @xmath13 and interior @xmath14 dofs as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , and assuming that there are no external forces on the interior nodes , result in the following equation : @xmath15    \\left [      \\begin{array}{c }        \\mathbf{q}_{b}\\\\        \\mathbf{q}_{i }      \\end{array }    \\right ]    =    \\left [      \\begin{array}{c }        \\mathbf{f}_{b}\\\\        \\mathbf{0 }      \\end{array }    \\right ]    \\label{eq02}\\ ] ]    the interior dofs can be eliminated using the second row of equation ( [ eq02 ] ) , which results in @xmath16    the first row of equation ( [ eq02 ] ) becomes @xmath17",
    "it should be noted that only boundary dofs are considered in the following .",
    "the cell is assumed to be meshed with an equal number of nodes on their opposite sides .",
    "the boundary dofs for one cell are decomposed into left @xmath18 and right @xmath19 dofs as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq04 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath20 =    \\left [      \\begin{array}{cc }        \\mathbf{d}_{ll}^{(1 ) } & \\mathbf{d}_{lr}^{(1 ) } \\\\",
