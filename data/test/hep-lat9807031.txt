    "the incorporation of fermionic degrees of freedom in the simulation of lattice qcd is a longstanding problem . at present",
    "the hybrid monte carlo algorithm @xcite is the state of the art algorithm for the simulation of full qcd on the lattice .",
    "most of qcd simulations up to now were performed in the so called quenched approximation where the fermion determinant is approximated by a constant factor .",
    "simulations of 2-flavour qcd on lattices of a size that might just allow a physically meaningful interpretation were performed just recently @xcite .",
    "extremely large autocorrelation times of the topological charge have been observed in hybrid monte carlo simulations of qcd with staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "one might ask whether the small step - size of the hybrid monte carlo creates particular problems in switching the topological sector .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that the topological charge is indeed the slowest mode in the hybrid monte carlo simulation of qcd with wilson fermions .",
    "however the integrated autocorrelation time of the topological charge is only larger by a small factor than that of other quantities .",
    "nevertheless it seems desirable to have a finite step - size updating algorithm as a complement of the hybrid monte carlo .",
    "formally the multi - boson approach of m. lscher @xcite allows for a finite - step - size updating of the gauge - field .",
    "however in the chiral limit the number of bosonic fields has to be increased",
    ". these fields amount to a large `` force '' on the gauge - field and allow only small changes in a single update step .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact the first proposal for a practical qcd algorithm by weingarten and petcher @xcite in 1981 is a finite step - size algorithm . since the update of a single link ( or a fixed small number of links ) requires the evaluation of the inverse of the fermion matrix applied to a vector , the cpu - time required for a full sweep over the lattice increases with @xmath0 even at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for that reason this algorithm and variants of it @xcite ( and many more refs . ) where abandoned when the hybrid monte carlo algorithm @xcite was introduced in 1989 which has a volume dependence like @xmath3 for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we will demonstrate how finite step - size algorithms can be speeded up by a large ( order 100 ) factor .",
    "still progress is needed to overcome the @xmath0 increase of the cpu - time , such that the algorithm becomes an alternative to the hybrid monte carlo algorithm in present day simulations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we will discuss the action to be simulated .",
    "here we shall explain how the hopping parameter expansion can be incorporated into the simulation in an unbiased form .",
    "next we show how the variance of the noisy estimator of the fermion determinant can be reduced .",
    "the major novelty of the simulation is the use of a sequence of approximations of the exact action in a multi - level metropolis scheme ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    "we will present first numerical tests of the methods proposed .",
    "these tests are performed with the two flavour 2d schwinger model with wilson action and two - flavour qcd with wilson action and schrdinger functional boundary conditions . in section 5",
    "we compare our method with related approaches .",
    "finally we give a short outlook on possible improvements of the methods discussed .",
    "in order to perform numerical simulations the grassmann variables in the path - integral formulation of qcd are in general integrated out .",
    "what remains is a boltzmann - factor that only depends on the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "for example in the case of two flavours of mass - degenerate fermions we obtain @xmath4 \\ ; \\exp(-s_g[u ] ) \\ ; { \\mbox{det } } \\ ; m^{\\dag } m \\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 $ ] is the gauge action and @xmath6 the fermion matrix in its non - hermitian form .    for reasonably large lattice sizes",
    "the problem still remains intractable in this form since the evaluation of the determinant requires of the order @xmath7 operations .",
    "a way out of the problem was proposed by weingarten and petcher who use the identity @xmath8 \\mbox{d } [ \\eta^{\\dag } ]   \\exp(-|m^{-1 } \\eta|^2)\\ ] ] to introduce auxiliary bosonic degrees of freedom : @xmath4   \\mbox{d } [ \\eta ] \\mbox{d } [ \\eta^{\\dag } ] \\ ; \\exp(-s_g[u]-|m^{-1 } \\eta|^2 ) \\ ; \\;.\\ ] ] this reduces the calculation of the action to a problem which takes of the order @xmath9 operations at the price of a noisy estimate of the fermion matrix .",
    "note that the hybrid monte carlo is also based on this action .    in the following",
    "we will use the hopping parameter expansion to evaluate part of the fermion determinant non - noisy while the remainder is treated in a similar fashion as weingarten and petcher treat the full fermion matrix .",
    "let us start the discussion with the effective weight for two flavours of degenerate fermions @xmath10 @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 ( in the red - black preconditioned case we have to replace @xmath2 by @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14 can now be written as a taylor series in @xmath2 @xmath15 in the following we use the first @xmath16 terms explicitly as action for our updates of the link variables while the remaining part is dealt with stochastically .",
    "we define @xmath17 or equivalently @xmath18 so we arrive at the action @xmath19 =   s_g[u ] + \\mbox{tr } \\sum_{n=1}^k \\frac{1}{n } \\kappa^n h[u]^n   +    \\mbox{h.c . }",
    "+ |\\tilde m[u]^{-1 } \\eta|^2   \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] in the following section we will give a noise reduced replacement of @xmath20 which will lead to the action which is simulated at the end .",
    "the fermionic determinant can be rewritten as @xmath21 which allows to rewrite each of the factors separately as an integral over auxiliary bosonic variables @xmath22 { \\mbox d } [ \\eta_1^{\\dag } ] ...      { \\mbox d } [ \\eta_r ] { \\mbox d } [ \\eta_r^{\\dag } ]   \\exp(-\\sum_{i=1}^{r } | m^{-1/r } \\eta_i |^2 ) \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] the @xmath23 and @xmath24 are computed as taylor series in @xmath25 .    in the limit @xmath26 the integrand gives , up to a factor that does not depend on the gauge - field , the fermion determinant .",
    "note that for complex @xmath27 in a unit circle around @xmath28 we have @xmath29 this can be easily shown : with @xmath30 we get @xmath31    equilibrium @xmath32 for a given gauge field are given by @xmath33 where the @xmath34 have a gaussian distribution .",
    "hence we obtain for the integrand of eq .",
    "[ noise ] @xmath35 with @xmath36 we arrive at the result @xmath37    finally we arrived at the action ( up to red - black preconditioning ) which is used for the simulations : @xmath38 the parameters that characterise the action are the order of the hopping parameter expansion @xmath16 and the root @xmath39 of the modified fermion matrix @xmath40 .",
    "the novel feature of our updating scheme is that a sequence of approximations @xmath41 of the full action is used .",
    "this sequence of actions is organised such that the actions become better approximations of the full action while at the same time the computational effort to compute them increases .    for the action above the sequence of approximations",
    "is realized in a rather trivial way :    the first approximation is given by the gauge action plus the `` hopping part '' of the fermion action @xmath42 while better approximations are given by the truncation of the taylor series of @xmath43 at a finite order @xmath44 .",
    "hence the sequence of actions is characterised by a sequence of truncation orders @xmath45 where @xmath46 means that the series is truncated at an order such that the sum of the remaining terms is below a given ( small ) bound .",
    "we should note that the auxiliary field @xmath47 can be updated in a global heat - bath step @xmath48 where @xmath49 has a gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore we will update the @xmath50 just once for every update cycle . in the following discussion of the update of the gauge - field @xmath51",
    "we therefore assume a fixed @xmath50 .",
    "let us first discuss the algorithm for the simplest case which is given by @xmath52 .",
    "such two - step decompositions of the action are actually in common use .    for the simplicity of the discussion",
    "we assume @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "first a number of link - updates are performed with cabibbo - marinari @xcite updating or micro - canonical over - relaxation @xcite such that the whole update sequence respects detailed balance with respect to the pure gauge action .",
    "( for a detailed discussion see below . ) this way a proposal @xmath55 for the full action is generated . the proposal @xmath55 is accepted with the probability given by @xmath56 + s_2[u ] ) ] \\ ] ] with @xmath57 and @xmath58+s_2[u ]   =   -|m(u')^{-1 } \\eta|^2   + |m(u)^{-1 } \\eta|^2\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that this algorithm fulfils detailed balance with respect to the action @xmath59 :    for @xmath60 we get :    * case 1 : * @xmath61 \\ge s_2[u]$ ] + for the update of @xmath51 to @xmath55 we obtain @xmath62+s_2[u])\\ ] ] while for the update of @xmath55 to @xmath51 we get @xmath63 taking the ratio and using the fact that @xmath64 satisfies detailed balance with respect to @xmath65 we get @xmath66+s_1[u ] ) \\ ; \\exp(-s_2[u']+s_2[u ] ) = \\exp(-s_2[u']+s_2[u])\\ ] ]    * case 2 : * @xmath61 < s_2[u]$ ] works just analogously .",
    "the generalisation to @xmath67 is done recursively .",
    "given an update algorithm @xmath68 that fulfils detailed balance with respect to an action @xmath69 we construct an algorithm @xmath70 that fulfils detailed balance with respect to the action @xmath71 .",
    "this process is iterated until we reach the exact action of the model .",
    "we use the algorithm @xmath68 that fulfils detailed balance with respect to the action @xmath69 in order to construct a proposal . starting from a configuration @xmath51 we apply the elementary update step of @xmath68 @xmath72 times to obtain the proposal @xmath55 .",
    "the composition of the elementary update steps has to be done in such a way that detailed balance is maintained for the whole sequence .",
    "( a discussion of this point is given below . ) the proposal @xmath55 is then accepted with the probability @xmath73 + s_i[u ] ) ] \\;\\;\\ ] ] with @xmath74 .",
    "next we have to discuss how the updates with the action @xmath65 should look in detail .",
    "the basic building blocks in the case of qcd will be the well known cabibbo - marinari heat - bath update @xcite and the micro - canonical over - relaxation update @xcite .",
    "both algorithms fulfil detailed balance when applied to a single subgroup of a given link - variable .",
    "however one should note that a sequence of ( different ) updating steps which individually satisfy detailed balance , in general does not satisfies detailed balance as a whole .",
    "this statement in particular applies to sweeping through the lattice with cabibbo - marinari or over - relaxation in a given order .    in simulations of the pure gauge theory",
    "this does not pose a problem since the sequence still satisfies the weaker and sufficient condition of stability @xmath75 however the basic building - blocks of our algorithm have to satisfy detailed balance .",
    "the simplest composition that does fulfil detailed balance is to select the link and the sub - group randomly for each link - update .    for performance reasons",
    "however it is desirable to stay with a regular pattern of sweeping through the lattice . as simple way to achieve this is to choose with probability @xmath76 either a given sequence of elementary update steps or with equal probability its exact reverse ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) this symmetrisation restores detailed balance .",
    "let as prove the statement for a sequence of two updates .",
    "the update probability of the symmetrised composite of the two updates @xmath77 and @xmath78 is given by @xmath79    now for any intermediate configuration @xmath55 we have : @xmath80 where we have used that @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfy detailed balance .",
    "since that ratio is identical for any intermediate configuration @xmath55 , the ratio of the integral over the @xmath55 takes the same value as for each of the individual @xmath55 . hence detailed balance is satisfied for the whole sequence .",
    "as first tests of the algorithm proposed above we simulated the 1 + 1-dimensional 2-flavour schwinger model with wilson fermions and 3 + 1-dimensional 2 flavour qcd with wilson fermions and with schrdinger - functional boundary conditions . in both cases we performed most of the simulations at one set of parameters . the sets of parameters where chosen such that we could compare our results with the literature @xcite in the case of the schwinger model are with results obtained within the alpha - collaboration @xcite in the case of qcd .",
    "the aim of this numerical study is to obtain a first impression of the effectiveness of our new proposals compared to the hybrid monte carlo and the multi - boson algorithm . since it is very likely that further substantial improvements of the algorithm can be found we think that it is not the time yet to systematically study the dependence of the performance of the algorithm on all parameters of the theory .",
    "we simulate the two - flavour two dimensional lattice schwinger model with wilson fermions .",
    "the gauge part of the action is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 where the link variables @xmath83 are elements of @xmath84 .",
    "the fermion matrix can be written as @xmath85 the hopping part of the fermion matrix is given by @xmath86 where in two dimensions we choose the @xmath87-matrices as @xmath88 as for other algorithms preconditioning improves the performance of our algorithm considerably .",
    "a simple version of preconditioning is the so called red - black preconditioning .",
    "the sites of the lattice are decomposed in even and odd sites .",
    "then the fermion matrix can be written in the from @xmath89 for the fermion determinant the identity @xmath90 holds .",
    "hence the original problem is reduced by half in the dimension ( of the fermion determinant ) .",
    "the bosonic field @xmath47 which is used for the stochastic estimate of the fermion determinant lives only on even sites",
    ". the red - black preconditioned fermion matrix is given by @xmath91    most of our tests are done for the single parameter set @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this set was chosen to compare our results for wilson loops of various sizes with those recently given by irving and sexton @xcite .",
    "one simulation was performed at @xmath92 and @xmath94 to see the effects of going closer to @xmath95 .    as elementary updates at level 1 we took updates of randomly selected link variables .",
    "these link variables are updated by heat - bath which was implemented by a multi - hit metropolis update . as criterion to stop the taylor series of @xmath96 we used @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the taylor coefficient of the order @xmath44 and @xmath96",
    "is evaluated up to order @xmath44 .      in a first set of numerical experiments we studied the effect of preconditioning and noise reduction on acceptance rates . in order to keep things ( conceptually )",
    "simple we used only a two - step decomposition ( l=2 ) for these studies and made no use of the hopping parameter expansion .    in order to obtain the acceptance rate as a function of the number of link variables that are updated in a single proposal we performed in a single simulation between 200 and 1000 sequences of update - cycles , where in each sequence the number of updated links for one proposal runs from 1 to some maximal number .",
    "the acceptance rates are collected during the run .",
    "the simulations are all performed on a @xmath99 lattice .",
    "we tested the cases of no preconditioning and @xmath53 , and red - black preconditioning in combination with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "our results are given in figure 1 .",
    "we made no effort to compute error - bars .",
    "the errors should be roughly of the size of the fluctuations of the curves .",
    "@xmath102 acceptance is reached for no preconditioning with @xmath53 at about 2 links updated , while for preconditioning with @xmath53 @xmath102 acceptance is obtained for about @xmath103 to @xmath104 links updated .",
    "we should note that this amounts to a performance advantage of preconditioning by a factor of 4 to 5 since the computation of the action requires only half of the operations that are needed in the non - preconditioned case .",
    "with preconditioning and @xmath105 we obtain @xmath102 acceptance with about 9 , 20 and 40 links updated .",
    "since the numerical effort of computing the action grows linearly in @xmath39 there is no direct performance gain by using the roots of the fermion matrix .",
    "however as we will see later it is quite useful that a larger number of links can be updated in one update proposal .",
    "the roots might also allow for a simple version of parallelisation : the application of @xmath106 could be done independently by one processor for each of the @xmath32 .",
    "we should note of course that the acceptance rate as a function of @xmath39 is bounded by the acceptance rate that is obtained with the exactly evaluated fermion determinant .",
    "@xcite however suggests that for lattices of the size that we consider here even for full sweeps over the lattice reasonable acceptance rates are obtained when the fermion determinant is evaluated exactly .",
    "we produced almost independent configurations by updating 6400 links ( which is several times the number of links of the lattice ) in one proposal .",
    "we obtained an acceptance rate of @xmath107 .      in a second set of numerical experiments we studied the inclusion of the hopping parameter expansion to order @xmath108 and @xmath109 . again only a two - step decomposition ( l=2 ) of the action is used .",
    "we performed the test with @xmath53 and @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath53 on the @xmath99 lattice and preconditioning we find @xmath102 acceptance for @xmath109 at about 30 links updated , for @xmath108 at about 13 links updated .",
    "for @xmath54 we found already above 4 to 5 links .",
    "this means that the performance is increased by a factor more than 6 by using the hopping parameter expansion up to the order @xmath109 .    for @xmath110 on the @xmath99 lattice and preconditioning",
    "we find @xmath102 acceptance for @xmath109 at about 95 links updated , for @xmath108 at about 50 links updated .",
    "for @xmath54 we found already above 20 links .",
    "hence the performance of the algorithm is more then doubled when @xmath111 is used instead of @xmath54 and becomes four - fold for @xmath109 .",
    "we did not investigate the inclusion of higher orders of the hopping parameter expansion into the algorithm .",
    "the order @xmath109 is accomplished by a shift of the @xmath1 to @xmath112 .",
    "since higher orders of the hopping parameter expansion require new terms in the gauge - action there will be a trade - off between the evaluation of these terms and a larger number of links that can be updated with action @xmath65 at a given acceptance rate .",
    "finally for @xmath110 , @xmath109 fixed and red - black preconditioning we studied the performance of update cycles with @xmath67 .",
    "the first question that arises is how many levels one should choose and how one should optimise the parameters @xmath113 ( truncation order ) and @xmath114 ( number of updates at level @xmath115 ) of the cycle .    the most direct criterion to judge the quality of an algorithm is the product of the square of the statistical error of the observable that is measured multiplied with the cpu - time needed to obtain the result .",
    "however this criterion requires to perform full simulations for each parameter set to be tested .",
    "therefore one would like to have a more practical method to estimate the performance of a given cycle .",
    "it seems very natural to assume that the autocorrelation times are proportional to the number of links that have been updated within one cycle . on the other hand the major part of the cpu - time",
    "is spent with the multiplication of the off - diagonal part of the fermion matrix @xmath106 on a vector .",
    "both these numbers can be determined with reasonable accuracy from rather short runs ( order 10 cycles ) .",
    "therefore we take the ratio of accepted link - updates divided by the number of @xmath106 times vector applications as performance index ( pi ) of a cycle .",
    "we made a first attempt to perform the optimisation of the cycle - parameters automatically .",
    "we start from a guess for the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the performance index ( pi ) is computed by averaging over 10 or 20 cycles . in a step of the optimisation we propose small random changes of the @xmath113 and @xmath114 to obtain a new proposal @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the pi of the @xmath116 and @xmath117 is computed by averaging over 10 or 20 cycles .",
    "if the pi of the new parameters is larger than the old one , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are replaced by @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "typically we performed 200 steps in this procedure .",
    "fortunately it turns out that the performance does not depend very sharply on the parameters of the cycle .",
    "0.2 cm    .[schwinger16r4p ] _ cycle - parameters for the simulations of the 2d schwinger model at @xmath92 , @xmath93 on a @xmath99 lattice .",
    "for details see the test .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on average a cycle of the update requires 4836(16 ) applications of the off - diagonal part of the fermion matrix .",
    "the 100 measurements are not sufficient to produce reliable estimates of the autocorrelation times and of the statistical error of @xmath118 therefore we only quote the estimated @xmath119 : @xmath120 we conclude that `` block - update '' is more efficient than the `` point - update '' .",
    "our @xmath119 results can be compared with the other two algorithms benchmarked by the alpha collaboration : @xmath121 was obtained as preliminary result by u.wolff with the non - hermitian version of the multi - boson algorithm with re - weighting @xcite and @xmath122 was obtained by k. jansen @xcite with the polynomial hybrid monte carlo algorithm @xcite . in the last case only @xmath106 applications have been counted .",
    "additional costs have not been converted into @xmath119 .",
    "we conclude that for a @xmath123 system we already have reached similar efficiency as the multi - boson and the polynomial hybrid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "however , at least with the present implementation , we have to expect a worse scaling of the efficiency with the lattice size as for the multi - boson and the hybrid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "therefore further progress is needed to obtain a competitive algorithm for lattice sizes that are needed for the calculation for the running coupling or light hardron spectroscopy .",
    "irving and sexton @xcite use approximations of the fermion determinant to simulate the 2d schwinger model and qcd .",
    "they try to approximate the fermion action by adding wilson - loops of different sizes and shapes to the gauge action . among other things they propose to construct an exact algorithm by generating a proposal by using the approximate action .",
    "they have in mind a two - level metropolis scheme .",
    "however also in their context one could think of a sequence of approximations by incorporating more and more wilson loops .    in a recent paper duncan , eichten and thacker @xcite",
    "propose to split the fermion determinant into two parts .",
    "one part is given by the product of the smallest eigenvalues .",
    "they suggest that the remaining part can be expressed in terms of small wilson loops . in their simulation",
    "they approximated the fermion determinant just by the product of the the smallest eigenvalues .",
    "they argue that the remaining part of the the fermion determinant effectively amounts to a @xmath1-shift .    in the same spirit one could simulate with a @xmath40 that corresponds to a moderate order of the hopping - parameter expansion and ignor the small orders of the hopping parameter expansion .",
    "thron , dong , liu and ying @xcite estimate the fermion determinant stochastically .",
    "their method to reduce the noise of their estimator incorporates , as @xmath40 in this paper , the hopping parameter expansion .",
    "there are several directions in which progress could be made",
    ".    first one could try to use higher orders of the hopping - parameter expansion . in the present paper we only considered the hopping parameter expansion up to order @xmath109 .",
    "this leads only to a shift in @xmath1 . at order @xmath124 , in 4 dimensions , wilson loops of three different shapes",
    "these were implemented for example in ref .",
    "@xcite . going to even higher orders",
    ", the number of wilson loops needed grows exponentially in the order .",
    "therefore one has to look for a more efficient method to compute @xmath125 than expressing it in terms of wilson loops",
    ".    one might find noise reduced unbiased estimators of the fermion determinant that are less cpu - intensive than those discussed in section 2.2 of this paper .",
    "finally one might look at approximation schemes different from that discussed in this paper . in this paper",
    "the taylor series of the fermion matrix in @xmath2 is used as the basis of the approximation scheme .",
    "one might construct approximations of the action by truncating @xmath126 in real space , i.e. allowing only non - zero matrix elements @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "the quality of the approximation is then controlled by @xmath129 .",
    "i would like to thank the alpha - collaboration for providing fortran90-code for pure qcd with schrdinger functional boundary conditions ( stefan sint , stefano capitani ) , performance data for the multi - boson and hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( ulli wolff , karl jansen ) and finally for discussions with all participants of the tuesday seminar in our group at humboldt university , klaus pinn and stefano vinti .",
