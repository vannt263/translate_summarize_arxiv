    "in the last decade our knowledge about the evolution of global galaxy properties over a large redshift range has improved considerably . the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , and the 2mass survey",
    "@xcite have provided very large local galaxy samples with spectroscopic and/or photometric information in various passbands .",
    "thanks to these data sets we are now able to assess very accurate local ( @xmath6 ) reference points for many galaxy evolution measurements like the luminosity function , the star formation activity , the spatial clustering of galaxies , the stellar population , the morphology , etc .    in the redshift range between @xmath7 pioneering work has been done in the context of the canada france redshift survey @xcite , the autofib survey @xcite and in the canadian network for observational cosmology survey @xcite .",
    "they provide accurate distances and absolute luminosities by spectroscopic followup of optically selected galaxies , thus being able to probe basic properties of galaxy evolution .",
    "moreover the k20-survey @xcite as well as the munics survey @xcite extend the analysis into the near infrared regime ( for @xmath8 ) .",
    "an important step towards probing the galaxy properties also in the high redshift regime around @xmath9 and @xmath10 was the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they used colour selection to discriminate between low and high redshift galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the so - called lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , mainly starburst galaxies at high redshift ) are selected by means of important features in the uv spectrum of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the next milestones in pushing the limiting magnitude for detectable galaxies to fainter and fainter limits were the space based hubble deep field north ( hdfn ; @xcite ) and hubble deep field south ( hdfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "although of a limited field of view of about @xmath11 only , the depth of the hdfs allowed the detection of galaxies up to a redshift of 5 and even beyond .    in the past years",
    "the space based hdfs were supplemented by many more multi - band photometric surveys like the ntt susi deep field ( ndf ; @xcite ) , the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ; @xcite ) , the william herschel deep field ( whdf ; @xcite ) , the subaru deep field / survey ( sdf ; @xcite ) , the combo-17 survey @xcite , fires @xcite , the fors deep field ( fdf ; @xcite ) , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ) , the ultra deep field ( udf and udf - parallel acs fields ; @xcite ) , the virmos deep survey @xcite , gems @xcite , the keck deep fields @xcite , and the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ; @xcite ) .    with the advent of all these deep multi - band photometric surveys",
    "the photometric redshift technique ( essentially a generalisation of the drop - out technique ) can be used to identify high - redshift galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts are often determined by means of template matching algorithm that applies bayesian statistics and uses semi - empirical template spectra matched to broad - band photometry ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "redshifts of galaxies that are several magnitudes fainter than typical spectroscopic limits can be determined reliably with an accuracy of of 0.02 to 0.1 .    in this context",
    "the cosmos survey ( @xcite ; see also http://www.astro.caltech.edu/cosmos/ for an overview ) combines deep to very - deep multi - waveband information in order to extend the analysis of deep pencil beam surveys to a much bigger volume , thus being able to drastically increase the statistics and detect also very rare objects . for this",
    ", the survey covers an area of about @xmath12 with imaging by space - based telescopes ( hubble , spitzer , galex , xmm , chandra ) as well as large ground based telescopes ( subaru , vla , eso - vlt , ukirt , noao , cfht , and others ) .    in this paper",
    "we combine publicly available u , b , v , r , i , z , and k cosmos data with proprietary imaging in the h band to derive a homogeneous multi - waveband catalogue suitable for deriving accurate photometric redshifts . in section  [ sec : imaging_data ] we give an overview of the near - infrared ( nir ) data acquisition and we describe our 2-pass data reduction pipeline used to derive optimally ( in terms of signal - to - noise for faint sources ) stacked images in section  [ sec : imaging_reduction ] .",
    "we also present nir galaxy number counts and compare them with the literature .",
    "+ in section  [ sec : isel_catalogue ] we present the deep multi - waveband i - band selected catalogue and discuss its properties , whereas the data reduction of the spectroscopic redshifts is described in section  [ sec : spec ] . in section  [ sec : photoz ] we present the photometric redshift catalogue , discuss the accuracy of the latter and show the redshift distribution of the galaxies . in section  [ sec : uvlf ] we derive the redshift evolution of the restframe uv luminosity function and luminosity density at 1500     from our i - selected catalogue before we summarise our findings in section  [ sec : summary_conclusion ] .",
    "we use ab magnitudes and adopt a @xmath13 cosmology throughout the paper with , , and .",
    "our observing strategy was designed to follow - up the publicly available cosmos observations with proprietary imaging in h band .",
    "the whole area is covered by 25 pointings ( 15.4x15.4 each ) to a depth adequate to the public nir data .",
    "the field layout and nomenclature is shown in fig.[fieldnomenclature ] .",
    "the programme was carried out as a joint effort between three large extragalactic survey projects currently being pursued at the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) , on calar alto : alhambra @xcite , manos - wide @xcite and munics - deep ( goranova et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "in addition , as a part of the munics - deep project , in one of the pointings ( 01c ) we have already collected deep js- and k-band data .      the observations in h , js and k bands were carried out using the nir wide - field imager omega2000 , operating at the prime focus of the caha 3.5 m telescope .",
    "omega2000 is equipped with a hawaii-2 hgcdte 2048x2048 array .",
    "the instrument pixel scale is 0.45per pixel , providing a field - of - view of 15.4x 15.4 .    here",
    "we present the h - band observations in 15 pointings ( see fig.[fieldnomenclature ] ) , collected during 11 nights spanned over 3 observing campaigns : december 2004 , february 2005 , and march / april 2005 .",
    "each pointing was observed for a total of at least 3 ksec .",
    "the individual exposure times were 3 sec , on - chip co - added to produce single frames of 60 sec each . except for 05b",
    ", at least 50 such frames ( depending on the weather conditions ) were observed per pointing .",
    "in addition , observations in js and k bands in 01c were collected during 7 night in the observing campaigns november 2003 and february 2006 .",
    "the total exposure time in js - band data was 8.2 ksec with the same individual exposure time scheme as for the h band .",
    "the k-band observations have a total of 7.7 ksec exposure time with individual exposures of 2 sec , co - added internally into single frames of 30 sec each .",
    "all observations were done using dithering pattern consisting of typically 20 positions shifted with respect to one another by 20 .",
    "the consecutive dithering sequences were repeated with the same pattern but with an offset in the origin .",

    "in this paper we present the data acquisition and reduction of nir js , h , and k bands in the cosmos field .",
    "we describe a 2-pass reduction pipeline to reduce nir data .",
    "the 2-pass pipeline is optimised to avoid flat - field errors introduced if the latter are constructed from science exposures .",
    "moreover we present and implement a method to stack images of different quality resulting in an optimal s / n ratio for faint sky dominated point sources .",
    "the js and k band cover an area of about ( 1 patch ) whereas the h band covers about @xmath16 ( 15 patches ) in total .",
    "the 50% completeness limits are 22.67 , @xmath17 , and 21.76 in the js , h , and k band , respectively .",
    "the number counts of all nir bands nicely agree with the number counts taken from literature .",
    "furthermore we present a deep and homogeneous i - band selected multi - waveband catalogue in the cosmos field by combining publicly available u , b , v , r , i , z , and k bands with the h band . the clean catalogue with a formal 50% completeness limit for point sources of @xmath1 comprises about 290  000 galaxies with information in 8 passbands and covers an area of about @xmath0 ( 12 patches ) .",
    "we exclude all objects with corrupted magnitudes in only one of the filters from the catalogue in order to have a catalogue as homogeneous as possible .",
    "photometric redshifts for all objects are derived and a comparison with 162 spectroscopic redshifts in the redshift range @xmath18 shows that the achieved accuracy of the photometric redshifts is with only @xmath3% outliers . please note that in order to break the degeneracy between high redshift and low redshift solutions we included also the galex fuv and nuv filters in the photometric redshift estimation which considerably reduced the number of outliers .",
    "the multi - waveband catalogue including the photometric redshift information is made publicly available .",
    "the data can be downloaded from ` ttp://www.mpe.mpg.de/~gabasc`/cosmos/    we derive absolute uv magnitudes and a comparison in a magnitude - redshift diagram with the fdf shows good agreement .",
    "moreover we investigate the evolution of the luminosity function evaluated in the restframe uv ( 1500   ) .",
    "we find a substantial brightening of m@xmath4 and a decrease of @xmath5 with redshift : from to the characteristic magnitude increases by about 3 magnitudes , whereas the characteristic density decreases by about 80  90% .",
    "we compare the redshift evolution of the uv luminosity density in the cosmos field and the fdf up to a redshift of @xmath19 . below a redshift of @xmath20",
    "the mean uv luminosity density in cosmos is systematically higher by about @xmath21 if compared to the fdf . at @xmath22",
    "both uv luminosity densities agree very well .",
    "it is worth noting the remarkably good agreement between the uv lf as well as the uv ld despite the fact , that the fdf is about 60 times smaller than the cosmos field analysed here .",
