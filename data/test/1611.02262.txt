    "homework is a key element in every undergraduate - level physics course for practicing problem solving .",
    "students commonly have difficulties combining physics concepts with mathematical calculations and selecting among known mathematical tools .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore how students employ mathematics when approaching physics homework problems .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the mathematical tools required in upper - division physics courses , such as evaluating integrals , using differential equations , or choosing appropriate coordinate systems .",
    "although these techniques are covered in mathematics classes , where students can successfully solve problems , many of them still struggle to apply these mathematical concepts to problems in physics .",
    "this is especially true at the upper - division when problems are more complicated and mathematics more tightly entwined with problem solving . in our study , we use the acer ( _ activation  construction  execution  reflection _ ) framework combined with network analytic methods to investigate how upper - division students written work shows their mathematical thinking on typical homework problems @xcite .",
    "the traditional undergraduate classical mechanics class is a textbook based 4 credit hour course with a solid foundation in the basics of theoretical physics .",
    "it is usually taken as the fourth physics course for physics majors and minors in the spring of their second year .",
    "typically , the students are concurrently enrolled in a differential equations course .",
    "the mechanics course under study is a typical exmaple of this course in the us .",
    "the textbook used in this course is _ classical mechanics _ by j. r. taylor @xcite .",
    "the lectures normally cover the first 10 chapters , including topics such as newton s laws of motion , momentum , angular momentum , energy , oscillations , lagrange s equations , two - body central - force problems and rotational motion of rigid bodies .",
    "we collected our data in a traditionally - taught classical mechanics class at a large land grant university .",
    "all homework problems were selected from the textbook and were chosen to encourage students to solve more practice problems . in return , students could earn extra credit towards their final grade .",
    "students were encouraged to work on problems in groups , but , for pedagogical reasons , they were to write their solutions independently .    in spring 2015",
    ", twelve students were enrolled in the class .",
    "they had thirteen weekly homework assignments ( each including 10 - 15 problems ) . a complete solution to each homework problem",
    "was expected to be about half a page long and include diagrams , mathematics and verbal statements .",
    "we scanned students submitted homework for analysis before passing them to the grader .",
    "all students in the course consented to participate in our research study .",
    "several attempts to model physics problem solving break it into discrete steps to be followed in a linear order @xcite . however , unless students are explicitly taught to follow these algorithms , their approaches to problem solving rarely fit these linear models .",
    "in contrast , studies using knowledge - in - pieces frameworks to understand students non - linear problem solving `` in the wild '' ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) rely on the richness of interview or video data to make inferences about student reasoning .",
    "the acer framework bridges the gap between prescriptive problem solving and knowledge - in - pieces @xcite .",
    "it was developed to analyze the use of mathematics in upper - division physics courses .",
    "the acer framework is organized around four components : _ activation _ ( determining the proper mathematical tool ) ; _ construction _ ( making a mathematical model ) ; _ execution _ ( performing mathematical steps ) ; and _ reflection _ ( checking the final solution ) . within each of these four components",
    ", students may perform multiple specific actions that are then detailed using sub - codes .",
    "for example , within construction , a student might choose a coordinate system or set the limits of integration .",
    "in solving a particular problem , a student may freely move among these components in any order , visiting each of them several times with different sub - codes .",
    "naturally , the details of the sub - codes depend on the specific physics topic and problems at hand .",
    "the acer framework was developed using think - aloud interview data on conceptually - rich research - based problems .",
    "these problems are different in character from the more traditional problems in our study .",
    "our data are wholly written accounts with sparse reasoning evidence . within these constraints , we refine our research question : how , if at all , can the modified acer framework be used to analyze written evidence of typical problem solving in a traditional course ?    prior work using acer framework has focused mostly on electricity and magnetism .",
    "we extended the standard sub - codes set to include codes appropriate for mechanics , as well as to cover students errors ( e.g. , mistakes done when taking derivatives , using an incorrect strategy , etc . ) .",
    "we coded students problem solutions , iteratively seeking new content codes and combining proposed codes until our code book covered @xmath0 of student work .",
    "as the code book approached stability eight people participated in inter - rater reliability testing to assure the code book was a valid representation of student problem solving .",
    "when the code book was stable , multiple graders looked at different problems to confirm the reliability of coding .",
    "once two graders coded individual problems and achieved @xmath1 agreement on student work , the code book was established . in this paper , we report on 3 problems selected from homework assignments across all students .",
    "we compare both across students and across problems to find patterns of mathematical tools use within each problem .",
    "to compare patterns in students solutions , we used techniques borrowed from network analysis @xcite . a network graph is a collection of points , called nodes , and a collection of lines connecting these points , called edges .",
    "when the direction of a connection matters , we have a _ directed graph_. in such case an edge from node a to b ( @xmath2 ) means something different than an edge from b to a ( @xmath3 ) . if the direction of a connection does not contain any information about the relation between nodes ( i.e , @xmath4 has the same meaning as @xmath5 ) , a graph is called _",
    "undirected_. a graph can be characterized using various measures , such as node and edge count , diameter or density .",
    "node and edge count correspond to the number of nodes and edges , respectively .",
    "diameter is the longest graph distance between any two nodes in the network and it represents the linear size of a network .",
    "density , on the other hand , is the ratio of the number of existing edges to the number of all possible edges , and can be thought of as a measure of network effectiveness .    to determine the most important nodes in a network",
    ", one can perform centrality analysis . depending on the nature of a network , as well as the category of the `` importance of a node ''",
    "one is interested in , there are multiple centrality measures that can be used .",
    "the most commonly used centralities are degree , betweenness , closeness and eigenvector .",
    "the degree indicates the importance of a node by the number of nodes connected to it , where the larger the degree , the more important the node is .",
    "betweenness counts the number of shortest paths that pass through a given node .",
    "the closeness centrality is the inverse of the sum of distances to all other nodes . finally , the eignevector , is the sum of a node s connections to other nodes weighted by their degrees @xcite .    within this framework ,",
    "in our case nodes represent acer sub - codes and the directed edges represent the order of steps students took to solve a given problem . in particular , we look at the diameter and density of each graph and compare it with these values for an expert solution",
    ". we also analyze the degree and eigenvector centralities as the most appropriate for studying our network .",
    "when looking at the network created from all solutions to a given problem , we weight the edges of the graph by how many times students connected a given two nodes to emphasize which connections between nodes are important . edges with higher weights represent crucial connections within a network .",
    "* problem 1 * a particle of mass @xmath6 is moving on a frictionless horizontal table and is attached to a massless string , whose other end passes through a hole in the table , where i m holding it . initially the particle is moving in a circle of radius @xmath7 with angular velocity @xmath8 , but i now pull the string down through the hole until a length @xmath9 remains between the hole and the particle .",
    "( a. ) what is the particle s angular velocity now ?",
    "( b. ) assuming that i pull the string so slowly that we can approximate the particle s path by circle of slowly shrinking radius , calculate the work i did pulling the string .",
    "( c. ) compare your answer to part ( b. ) with the particle s gain in kinetic energy .",
    "students in this class were not taught an explicit procedure to solve problems .",
    "rather , they were free to solve them any way that they could which gave us the opportunity to gain insight into their reasoning when left to their own devices .",
    "a solution for the sample problem is presented in .",
    "this particular problem was not presented with a diagram .",
    "we expected that in order to visualize the physical system , the students would start with drawing one . in our acer framework ,",
    "that would be represented by codes c1 ( pick a coordinate system ) and c2 ( visualize the problem ) .",
    "this problem has three parts and for all of them we expected students to begin with a general form of an equation , which would be coded as a2 ( use a general form of an equation ) . in part ( b. ) , as they have to do an integration , we expected codes e1 ( do the integration ) , e10 ( evaluate the integration ) and c5 ( set the limits of the integration ) to occur . both ( b. ) and",
    "( c. ) require substitutions from the answer obtained in part ( a. ) , therefore we expected also codes r4 ( does this answer fit in the next part ) and e3 ( make substitutions ) to be used .",
    "as students perform some mathematical operations here , it s obvious to expect codes related to doing algebraic steps as well as doing substitutions , which are e3 and e5",
    ". when we consider the problem as a whole , we expected nodes a2 , c1 , c2 , c5 , e1 , e3 , e5 ( doing algebra ) , e10 , r4 to be dominating codes .    a solution to problem 1 with a response coded according to the modified acer framework . ]",
    "when we used the acer framework alone , we saw codes a2 , c1 , c3 [ use an equation ( specific to the particular problem ) ] , c5 , e1 , e3 , e5 , e10 , r4 as the mostly commonly used , dominant codes . surprisingly , despite the lack of a figure in the problem statement , not all the students started by visualizing the problem .",
    "also , they used both the general form of the equation and the problem related non - general form .",
    "when we applied network analysis ( na ) along with centrality measures to the acer codes , we found that some of the nodes in the network , identified as important by the acer framework , turned out to be not significant when looked at using the na approach . on the other hand ,",
    "network analysis identified nodes as important which were not significant in the acer framework .",
    "network graphs representing two students solutions to the problem presented in ( a. , b. ) , all students responses to this problems merged into a single network ( c. ) and the expert s response to it ( d. ) . ]    shows the problem with a single student s solution coded according to the acer framework . in , the network graph for that student ( fig .",
    "2a ) , one other student ( fig .",
    "2b ) as well as for all students responses combined into single graph ( fig . 2c ) and an expert solution ( fig .",
    "2d ) to this particular problem are presented .",
    "one can see that , while for most part students used procedures which resulted in the same set of acer codes , their solving methods differ ( see fig .",
    "2a and fig .",
    "moreover , the `` all responses '' graph ( fig .",
    "2c ) is much more dense than each individual solution network , suggesting that , even though it was a well structured homework assignment , students took many different approaches to solving it .",
    "presents a summary of the basic descriptives for all networks presented in .",
    "when we look at sizes as measured by the diameter , we see that students networks are smaller than the expert s network .",
    "this was true in general , as the average diameter for the students was ( @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 ) .",
    "the average density of students solutions was ( @xmath13 @xmath11 @xmath14 ) with values for individual student s ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "when we look at centrality measures for this problem , the node e3 has the highest degree , indicating that it most frequently connects other steps in the problem solution .",
    "this is evidence that the mathematical operation of substitution is a crucial element in the solving process for this particular problem .",
    "moreover , almost all the homework problems had multiple parts within the problem and often subsequent parts required a substitution found in a previous section .",
    "when we look at the network created by combining solutions to this problem from all students , we found that the top three nodes for all students are the same as the top nodes for both sample students ( though their order is different ) .",
    "they differ , however , from the expert s solution .",
    "in particular , the component c3 lost its significance in the `` all students '' network .",
    "@lcccc & student a & student b & all students & expert solution + diameter & 6 & 5 & 7 & 7 + density & 0.155 & 0.167 & 0.632 & 0.191 + & c3 and e3 & r4 and e3 & e3 & e3 + & e5 and r4 & c3 & r4 & c3 + & a2 & e5 & e5 & e5 +      comparison between network graphs clearly show that students use two different approaches to solve this problem : 1 ) starting with visualizing the problem followed by either general or non general form of equations ; and 2 ) using general or non general form equations to start the problem , omitting the visualization part .",
    "while this particular problem does not explicitly ask for graphical representation of the physical situation , drawing appropriate diagrams is a useful problem solving strategy @xcite .",
    "students also tend to skip some mathematical steps , even though they are crucial in the solution .",
    "it seems as if some students were trying to solve the problem , but did not have a good grasp of the concepts underlying it . at the same time the expert s solution presents the problem solving process that , for illustrative purposes , includes steps that students might find unnecessary , thus becoming somewhat longer than it needs to be .",
    "thus , it may not be accurate to compare network graph for expert s solution with individual student s network graphs .",
    "comparison between all students and the expert s solution , on the other hand , will give us an idea about what procedures students used but the expert did not and vice versa . when we compare fig . 2c and fig .",
    "2d , we see some additional nodes in the network for all students together that do not appear in the expert s solution",
    ". other than one node in reflection on the final solution most of these nodes belongs to either activation or the construction of the solution . because the approach and the construction of a solution is somewhat person dependent",
    ", we could expect those differences and also the way they reflect on their answer could be different .",
    "we found that there is a dependence on the original problem statement reflected on the network graphs .",
    "in particular , we identified three different types of prompts that suggest to students how they should start the problem :    1 .",
    "the prompt directs students towards the physical system / a diagram as the problem statement asks for an explanation of the physical system .",
    "an example statement looks like `` start with a diagram / free body diagram '' .",
    "2 .   problem statement directs students to think about what bits / equations should they should bring together to get equivalent expression along with the physical system . to do",
    "so students requires physics knowledge along with math steps .",
    "an example statement looks like `` show that / prove that ... with the help of a physical system '' .",
    "3 .   problem statement is straightforward and asks them to perform certain mathematical operations .",
    "an example statement looks like `` take the derivative / solve the above position equation for acceleration '' .    in order to determine whether students take the same approach when working on problems that are structured similarly , we identified three problems that belong to the same category ( the second kind mentioned above ) and we studied networks created by combining solutions to these three problems .",
    "since we compare problems structured similarly , we expect the crucial components of students solutions to be similar across all students .",
    "allowing for some slight variations , the core of the solutions should remain unchanged .",
    "the problems we chose for our analysis include the one discussed in a previous section and thus we expected nodes a2 , c1 , c2 , c3 , c5 , e1 , e3 , e5 , e10 , r4 to be the dominating codes .",
    "@lcccc & student c & student d & student e & all students + diameter & 13 & 11 & 10 & 11 + density & 0.133 & 0.277 & 0.211 & 0.309 + & e5 & e3 & e3 & e5 + & a2 & e5 & c5 & e3 + & c3 & c5 and a2 & e5 & c5 and c3 +    table  [ tabl2 ] shows characteristics of networks created by combining three structurally similar problems for three individual students , as well as of a network representing solutions from all students in the class combined .",
    "it s clear that nodes a2 , c3 , c5 , e3 and e5 are most central for these networks .",
    "as we expected based on the structure similarly , students used general ( a2 ) or non - general ( c3 ) form equation to start the problem .",
    "nodes e3 and e5 again are the key players in the network , but since the problems include integrals , also the node c5 ( setting the integration limits ) becomes a prominent one . by comparing networks across different problems",
    ", we can see whether students are consistent in their approaches to solving problems with similar structure .",
    "it is clear that in all cases , node e5 was the most central node .",
    "also , the four most prominent nodes ( a2 , c3 , e3 , e5 ) are the same for all students and for the merged network , although their order differs slightly .",
    "this alone could suggest that students take similar approaches to solve all three problems and that these approaches are quite similar among students .",
    "network graphs created by combining students solutions to three problems from three individual students ( a.  c. ) and from all students responses merged into a single network ( d. ) . ]    however , when we look at the network representing student s solutions in we can see that the network presented in fig . 3a is significantly different from the other two networks ( fig . 3b and 3c ) . also the network characteristics in reveal that the network for student c has greater diameter and lower density ( less connected graph with more nodes ) , indicating that this student got sidetracked in his solution .",
    "this could not be seen by the acer framework alone , as the significant codes for this students were the same as for students who took more directed approach .",
    "here we compare two problems that falls into type one and type three as classified at the beginning of section [ sec : net_dep ] .",
    "problem 2 belongs to the third type and students are required to perform trivial math procedures .",
    "problem 3 , one the other hand , falls into the first type and required to start with a diagram .",
    "* problem 2 * the shortest path between two points on a curved surface , such as the surface of a sphere , is called a geodesic . to find a geodesic",
    ", one has first to set up an integral that gives the length of a path on the surface in question .",
    "this will always be similar to the integral @xmath17 but may be more complicated ( depending on the nature of the surface ) and may involve different coordinates than @xmath18 and _ y_. to illustrate this , use spherical polar coordinates ( _ r _ , _ @xmath19 _ , _ @xmath20 _ ) to show that the length of a path joining two points on a sphere of radius _ r _ is @xmath21    * problem 3 * consider the pendulum of figure  [ figure4 ] , suspended inside a railroad car that is being forced to accelerate with a constant acceleration @xmath22 .",
    "( a. ) write down the lagrangian for the system and the equation of motion for the angle @xmath20 . use a trick similar to the one used in @xmath23t@xmath24 to write the combination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as a multiple of @xmath27 ( b. )",
    "find the equilibrium angle @xmath20 at which the pendulum can remain fixed ( relative to the car ) as the car accelerates .",
    "use the equation of motion to show that this equilibrium is stable .",
    "what is the frequency of small oscillation about this equilibrium position ?",
    "( commenter : have some kind of header break here ? )    diagram for problem 3 . ]",
    "the size of a network is a measure of the number of nodes within a network .",
    "the network graph discussed in section [ sec : net_dep_sin_stud ] ( problem 1 ) has 16 nodes and 40 edges with 8 strongly connected nodes . the network graph for problem 2 has 14 nodes and 32 edges along with five strongly connected nodes and problem 3 has a network graph with 11 nodes and 31 edges with two strongly connected nodes .",
    "the network graph of problem 1 has a relatively large network size compared to other two problems .",
    "this may be because problem 1 has three sub sections and other two problems have fewer sub sections .",
    "( a. ) : network graph for all responses to problem 2 .",
    "( b. ) : network graph for all responses to problem 3 . ]",
    "network analysis shows that the most central nodes for the network graph ( c  all student responses ) for problem 1 are e3 , r4 , e5 and a2 with a network diameter of 5 .",
    "according to the problem statement , first students have to understand the physical system and then they could use relevant equations to solve the problem .",
    "the network graph clearly shows that the students start with c- codes ( construction ) , where the students do a visual representation and then use the a- codes ( activation ) , where students use appropriate equations . because the problem has three sub sections , students might recall the answer from the previous part and substitute it in next part thus , we get r4 and e3 as most central nodes . the network graph ( a  all students responses ) for problem 2 have e5 , e3 , c5 and e2 as most central nodes along with network diameter 5 .",
    "the phrasing of problem 2 also requires visual representation and the students start with c- codes ( construction ) with a diagram . because we do not have subsections ,",
    "r4 is not a most central node . the problem 3 ( b  all students responses in problem 3 ) network graph has most central nodes e3 , e5 , e2 and a2 with a network diameter of 4 .",
    "clearly some different nodes appear in this network graph compared to previous two problems .",
    "e2 becomes a central node because students were asked to find the equation of motion and students take derivatives . also to show that this equilibrium is stable students use boundary conditions by the c- codes c10 ( state boundary conditions ) and c11 ( apply boundary conditions ) .",
    "comparison between problem statements and the network graphs clearly show that there is a dependence of problem statement on the shape of the network .",
    "the analysis suggests that problems that consist of more sub sections lead to relatively complex network .",
    "the network graphs by all students and by each individual student can be directly used to estimate the students understanding of the subject material . more importantly",
    "the individual network graphs could be used to help or guide the students who might have stuck at a certain step with in the problem solving process .",
    "also , network graphs from both individual and all students together can be used to understand the difficulty level of the problems .",
    "if the students are taking more steps to reach the final answer than expected , there might be a issue with the way the problem statement was written .",
    "thus , the information about students performance revealed by the network graphs could be used to enhance the quality of the homework or quiz problems .",
    "the acer framework to code solutions lays out what steps students take in their solutions .",
    "the network analysis gives the most important nodes within the network . using both acer framework and network analysis",
    ", we can see what are the most important steps within the solution .",
    "network analysis indicates that in most of the analyzed cases , the most important nodes are e3 , e5 , a2 , r4 , and therefore substitution and algebra in general are crucial tools for solving these problems .",
    "most of the homework problems had a few parts within the problem and in these cases students may have had to go back and check the previous solution and then substitute it in the next part .",
    "while many problems have similar central nodes , the exact nodes and their order are different across students and across problems .",
    "the shape of the network graphs varies with different problem statements .",
    "we can conclude , even though these homework problems seem to be well designed , different students have different approaches to start the problem and different patterns in their construction section , in most of the cases , though , the math execution steps are the same . further research is needed to see exactly what properties of problem statements prompt the students to use specific mathematical tools .",
    "nonetheless , network analysis of students problem solutions reveals patterns in their tool use on typical problems .",
    "though our data cover 23 problems overall , they are limited to classical mechanics . to expand our study more broadly across the upper division",
