    "<S> we define and study in detail _ utraslow scaled brownian motion ( usbm ) _ characterised by a time dependent diffusion coefficient of the form @xmath0 . for unconfined motion the mean squared displacement ( msd ) of usbm exhibits an ultraslow , logarithmic growth as function of time , in contrast to the conventional scaled brownian motion . in an harmonic potential </S>",
    "<S> the msd of usbm does not saturate but asymptotically decays inverse - proportionally to time , reflecting the highly non - stationary character of the process . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the process is weakly non - ergodic in the sense that the time averaged msd does not converge to the regular msd even at long times , and for unconfined motion combines a linear lag time dependence with a logarithmic term . </S>",
    "<S> the weakly non - ergodic behaviour is quantified in terms of the ergodicity breaking parameter . the usbm process is also shown to be ageing : observables of the system depend on the time gap between initiation of the test particle and start of the measurement of its motion . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results are shown to agree excellently with extensive computer simulations . </S>"
