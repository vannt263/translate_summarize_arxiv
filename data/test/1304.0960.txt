    "the generation of short pulses of electromagnetic radiation is a primary challenge of modern physics .",
    "they find applications in studying molecular dynamics in biological objects and charge transfer in nanoelectronic devices , diagnostics of dense plasma and radar detection of fast moving objects .",
    "the advances in the generation of short pulses of electromagnetic radiation in infrared , visible , and ultraviolet ranges of wavelengths are traditionally associated with the development of quantum electronic devices - lasers .",
    "radiation in lasers is generated via induced emission of photons by bound electrons .",
    "electrovacuum devices , operating in a cooperative regime  @xcite , have recently become considered as an alternative to short - pulse lasers , whose active medium is formed by electrons bound in atoms and molecules .",
    "these are free electron lasers , cyclotron - resonance masers , and cherenkov radiators , whose active medium is formed by electron bunches propagating in complex electrodynamical structures ( undulators , corrugated waveguides and others ) .",
    "the feature of the cooperative operation regime lies in the fact that the radiation power scales as the squared number of particles in the bunch .",
    "this allows calling this regime `` superradiance '' by analogy with the phenomenon predicted by dicke in quantum electronics @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , that the electrons moving in fels are initially homogeneously distributed in the phase space . as a result , bremsstrahlung starts from sponteneous emission .",
    "this is true even if the bunch length is much smaller than the radiation wave length .",
    "in contrast to bremsstrahlung , cherenkov ( quasi - cherenkov ) radiation starts from coherent emission when such a short - length bunch is injected into a slow - wave structure , i. e. the radiation power is proportional to the squared number of particles .",
    "the question arises whether this dependence holds when the bunch length increases .",
    "this paper considers coperative radiation emitted by electron bunches when charged particles pass through crystals ( natural or artificial ) under the conditions of dynamical diffraction of elctromagnetic waves .",
    "note that a detailed analysis of the features of spontaneous radiation of electrons passing through crystals in both frequency @xcite and time @xcite domains has been carried out before .",
    "this radiation , emitted at both large and small angles with respect to the direction of electron motion , is called the parametric ( quasi - cherenkov ) radiation .",
    "the problems of amplification of induced parametric radiation have also been thoroughly studied in the literature @xcite , and the threshold current densities providing lasing in crystals have been calculated @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in the beginning , a nonlinear theory of interaction of relativistic charged particles and the electromagnetic field in crystals is set forth , followed by the results of numerical calculations of the parametric radiation pulse .",
    "then , the dependence of the radiation intensity on the electron bunch length and the geometrical parameters of the system is considered .",
    "the appendix outlines the algorithm used in the simulation .",
    "the feature of the algorithm is that it is based on the particle - in - cell method , which enables studying kinetic phenomena .",
    "let us note that in most of the existing codes ( see , e.g. @xcite ) used for simulating the interaction of charged particles and a synchronous wave , the motion of charged particles is considered within the framework of the hydrodynamic approximation .",
    "a theoretical analysis of parametric radiation can be performed only by means of a self - consistent solution of a nonlinear set of the vlasov ",
    "maxwell equations : @xmath0 @xmath1 describing the electron motion in the electric @xmath2 and magnetic @xmath3 fields . here",
    "@xmath4 is the particle distribution function over the coordinates @xmath5 and momenta @xmath6 , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the current and charge densities , respectively .",
    "since the crystal is a periodic linear medium with frequency dispersion , the fourier transform of the displacement current @xmath9 relates to the electric field @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where the summation is made over all reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "because the dielectric susceptibilities in natural crystals and in grid photonic crystals are inversely proportional to the frequency @xcite : @xmath12 , maxwell s equations can be reduced to the equation of the form : @xmath13    we shall further be interested in the case when two strong waves are excited in the crystal : the forward wave and the diffracted wave ( the so - called two - wave diffraction case ) . the forward wave ( its wave vector is denoted by @xmath14 ) is emitted at small angles with respect to the particle velocity , while the diffracted one , having the wave vector @xmath15 , is emitted at large angles to it ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "under the conditions of dynamical diffraction , the following relation is fulfilled : @xmath16 .",
    "+    let us perform the following simplifications : first , we shall neglect the longitudinal ( @xmath17 ) fields of the bunch , which is appropriate when the value of the langmuir oscillation frequency @xmath18 of the bunch is less than the values of @xmath19 . in this case , the coulomb forces will not have an appreciable effect on dielectric properties of the system .",
    "second , we shall seek for the electric field @xmath2 using the method of slowly varying amplitudes .",
    "third , we shall assume that a transversally infinite bunch executes one - dimensional motion along the @xmath20-axis ( this is achieved by inducing a strong axial magnetic field in the system ) .    under the conditions of two - wave diffraction",
    ", the field @xmath2 can be presented as a sum @xmath21 where the amplitudes of the forward @xmath22 and diffracted @xmath23 waves are slowly varying variables .",
    "this means that for the distances comparable with the wavelength and the times comparable with the oscillation period , the values of @xmath22 and  @xmath23 remain practically the same . substituting into and and then averaging them over the length @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a natural number , we obtain @xmath26 @xmath27",
    "now let us complete the set of equations and with boundary conditions ( the initial conditions are reduced to the condition that all values of the fields equal zero at @xmath28 ) : in the plane @xmath29 , let us specify the time dependence of function @xmath30 and set the field @xmath22 to zero . in the case of bragg diffraction , the boundary condition imposed on the diffracted wave is reduced to the condition that the field @xmath23 equals zero at @xmath31 , while in the case of laue diffraction , it equals zero at @xmath29 .",
    "the difference between the two diffraction schemes is not merely kinematic , but radical . under bragg diffraction conditions",
    ", there is a synchronous wave moving against the electrons of the beam , which gives rise to the internal feedback and absolute instability . in laue diffraction geometry ,",
    "a backward wave is absent , and as a result absolute instability does not evolve . it may seem that electromagnetic radiation is not generated .",
    "however , fluctuations , which always occur in real beams , are amplified when the beam enters the crystal ( due to convective instability , excited in the beam ) .    in analyzing multiparametric problems , to which the problem of parametric cooperative radiation refers",
    ", it is convenient to write equations and in a dimensionless form .",
    "this procedure enabled transferring the calculation results from one set of wavelengths and beam energies to another .",
    "the analysis shows that this procedure is easy to perform in the case when the electrons of the beam are ultrarelativistic ( the lorentz factor @xmath32 ) .",
    "let us note that the kinetic equation is equivalent to the system of relativistic equations of motion for the momenta @xmath33 and coordinates @xmath34 of particles , since @xmath35 ( the lower index @xmath25 runs over all beam s electrons inside the crystal ) .",
    "when @xmath32 , these equations are convenient to write with the phases of charged particles  @xmath36 substituted for independent variables .",
    "the substitution of variables @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the angle between the particle velocity and the wave vector @xmath14 ) then gives    @xmath41    @xmath42    here the quantity @xmath43 is determined at the moment when the @xmath25th particle enters the system , @xmath44 is the corresponding electron density , and @xmath45 is the number of particles over the length @xmath46 .",
    "the set of equations with boundary conditions contains four independent parameters : @xmath47 , @xmath48 that define the geometry of the system .",
    "in addition to these parameters , we need to specify the beam profile .",
    "let @xmath49 where the rise time @xmath50 is further assumed to be equal to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the bunch length and @xmath53 is the heaviside function ) .",
    "the characteristic feature of cooperative pulses is the peculiar dependence of the peak power on the number of particles @xmath54 in the bunch .",
    "when the particles are small in number , the radiation power monotonically increases until saturation is achieved .",
    "+     +     +    let us see now how the dynamical diffraction of electromagnetic waves affects the cooperative radiation in crystals .",
    "does parametric radiation possess the above described features inherent to other types of cooperative radiation ?",
    "how the bragg diffraction case is different from the case of laue diffraction ?",
    "we shall assume that @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and specify the system of units , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let us start our consideration with bragg diffraction .",
    "the results of computation ( fig .",
    "2 ) show that the radiation emitted at small angles reaches saturation at significantly smaller lengths of the bunch than that emitted at large angles .",
    "the transition from a one - dimensional distributed feedback ( @xmath62 ) to a two - dimensional one ( @xmath63 ) hardly causes any change in the intensity of radiation emitted at small angles to the particle velocity .    under laue diffraction conditions , the pulse of parametric radiation has a more complicated structure due to the convective character of instability : in the absence of noise , the generation occurs only at the ends of the bunch of charged particles . as a result ,",
    "the cooperative pulse possess a two - peak structure ( fig .",
    "the presence of noise leads to an appreciable change in the pulse form : the interval between the two pulses is filled with a chaotic signal ( fig.4 ) .",
    "this paper studies the features of parametric cooperative radiation emitted at both large and small angles to the particle velocity direction .",
    "both laue and bragg cases are considered .",
    "it is shown that under bragg diffraction conditions , the intensity of parametric radiation emitted at small angles reaches saturation at significantly smaller number of particles in the bunch than the intensity of radiation emitted at large angles .    under laue diffraction conditions ,",
    "the pulses of parametric radiation , emitted at both large and small angles to the particle velocity , possess a two - peak structure ; each of the peaks is associated with the front or back end of the bunch .",
    "the presence of noise leads to an appreciable change in the pulse form : the interval between the two pulses is filled with a chaotic signal .",
    "the set of equations and was solved using the particle - in - cell method , which is widely used in plasma physics  @xcite .",
    "this method implies that the solution of the kinetic equation is modeled using a large number of macroparticles moving along the characteristics of the kinetic equation .",
    "the current and charge densities are calculated from particle velocities and positions and are further used for computations of the electric field on a space - time mesh .",
    "the mesh values of the field are interpolated to the macroparticle locations ; then the forces acting on macroparticles are calculated .",
    "the approach described here is close to the method described by i.  j.  morey and c.  k.  birdsall in @xcite , which was used for travelling wave tube modeling .",
    "let us define the source @xmath67 on the right - hand side of , using the formula @xmath68 the contributions to each node come from the particles concentrated in the domain @xmath69 .",
    "summation in the first and second terms is made over all particles in the domains @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the weighting factors @xmath72 and @xmath73 are responsible for linear interpolation of the contributions to the node with number @xmath74 that come from each particle .",
    "complete the implicit difference scheme with the discrete analogues of the equations of motion of macroparticles : @xmath75 the field @xmath76 at particles locations can be found by means of linear interpolation from surrounding nodes : @xmath77      assume that each particle has a momentum @xmath80 and a charge @xmath81 . here @xmath82 is the average current density and @xmath83 is a random quantity .",
    "this quantity appears due to shot noise of charged particles , which in high power devices can achieve quite large values , because the electron flow consists of ectons @xcite . since the parametric radiation is narrow - band by nature , and the current density spectrum @xmath83",
    "is a slowly varying function of frequency @xmath84 , one can replace the real current density @xmath83 by a random quantity uniformly distributed in the domain @xmath85 .",
    "the level of noise is determined by the fluctuation current density @xmath86 . by analogy with the case of fluctuations of current , particle distribution over momenta",
    "can be introduced into the system .",
    "particles are extracted from the system after they reach the coordinate @xmath87 .",
