    "the radio frequency dressed potentials ( rf - dressed potentials ) , initially proposed by zobay and garraway @xcite , are considered as convenient tool to trap and manipulate ultra - cold atoms in exotic forms @xcite .",
    "non - trivial trapping geometries like ring trap , double well and shell traps have already been demonstrated using potentials generated from various combinations of static magnetic field , radio frequency ( rf ) field and far detuned laser beams @xcite .",
    "these trapping geometries provide opportunity to explore basic physics of fermions and bosons in low dimensions , matter wave interferometry @xcite , etc .",
    "the ring shaped atom traps , besides being useful for fundamental studies , are also promising for the development of atom gyroscope for precision rotation sensors for navigation @xcite .",
    "the rf - dressed potentials , also known as `` adiabatic potentials '' , are energy eigenvalues of an interaction hamiltonian for an atom interacting with an rf - field in presence of a static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "dependence of these potentials on the atom - field coupling strength and frequency detuning of the rf - field with the zeeman sub - levels transition frequency , make them inherently position dependent and capable of providing interesting atom - trapping geometries @xcite .",
    "the rf - dressed potentials also promise a great flexibility of tailoring them by changing the rf - field strength , polarization , frequency and phase @xcite . by varying the rf - field parameters ,",
    "the resultant rf - dressed potential can be made time dependent , which may be exploited for multiple purposes , such as initially for evaporative cooling of atom cloud and then for trapping in a designed geometry .",
    "such an example of atom trapping in a toroidal geometry has been demonstrated recently by our group by applying an rf - field of varying amplitude and frequency on a cloud of @xmath0 atoms trapped in a quadrupole magnetic trap @xcite .    in the earlier work @xcite , it was demonstrated that a quadrupole magnetic trap was converted into a toroidal shaped atom - trap , when the frequency and amplitude of the applied rf - field were ramped ( varied with time ) in the chosen way . in that work ,",
    "the atom cloud was characterized and studied after the end of the ramp of the rf - field - when rf - field was left on at a fixed final frequency and amplitude . a natural curiosity , however , related to these experiments , remains to understand the various processes involved and their effect on the evolution of the characteristics of the atom cloud during the ramp of the rf - field . in the present work ,",
    "we have made an attempt to understand the time evolution of the atom cloud , in terms of variation in its shape and number of atoms , during the rf - field ramp ( i.e. during the transformation of the quadrupole trap into an rf - dressed toroidal trap ) .",
    "we have performed the simulations considering the atom cloud evolving in a time dependent potential formed due to ramp of rf - field in presence of a static quadrupole magnetic field .",
    "the simulations results have been compared with the experimental observations .    in the simulations , we have used the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) technique which is based on an extension of the original proposal of bird @xcite .",
    "different variants of dsmc method have already been used to understand the evaporative cooling @xcite and expansion cooling @xcite of atoms .",
    "the results of simulations show that , at lower rf - field strength and higher frequency ( at the beginning of ramp of the rf - field ) , the rf - field results in ejection of atoms from the trap , leading to evaporative cooling of the atom cloud .",
    "later on , at higher rf - field strength and lower frequency , the atoms can undergo the landau - zener ( lz ) transition which leads to their trapping in an rf - dressed potential of toroidal shape .",
    "the results of these simulations explain well our experimental observations related to temporal variation in the number of atoms and shape of the atom cloud in the trap .",
    "similar simulations can be performed to predict the dynamics of atom cloud with more sophisticated evolution of the potential which can help in exploring more efficient cooling and trapping schemes .",
    "the dsmc method does not require the  sufficient ergodicity \" approximation and thus can simulate atomic ensembles far from their equilibrium condition .",
    "this makes dsmc technique more suitable to simulate our experimental conditions where a fast ramp of the rf - field parameters ( amplitude and frequency ) is considered .",

    "it is assumed that the trapping magnetic field is not very strong and the energy gap among zeeman sub - levels varies linearly with the field strength .",
    "hence , an applied rf - field of appropriate frequency can be simultaneously resonant to all the transitions involving adjacent sub - levels .",
    "the rf - field is considered to be ramped to have time varying amplitude and frequency , as discussed specifically later , in a manner as reported in our recent experimental work @xcite . when the rf - field is sufficiently strong ( _ i.e. _ rabi frequency is high ) , the atom - field interaction is described better in the  dressed state \" @xcite picture involving the diagonalization of both the static and coupling hamiltonian . in our simulations",

    "whereas in dressed state formalism , evaporation of atoms is accomplished by only following the @xmath32 state , without considering any transition . in this picture , the non - adiabatic transition of an atom from the @xmath32 state to state @xmath33 leads to trapping of the atom in a different potential landscape corresponding to state @xmath33 .    the particular state @xmath33 has potential minima on the surface of an ellipsoid co - centred with the quadrupole trap .",
    "with a suitable choice of strength of static magnetic and rf- fields , and the high confinement along the quadrupole trap axis ( _ i.e. _ z - axis ) , the trapping potential can form a toroidal trapping geometry .",

    "the rf - field for that can have a frequency close to the separation between the dressed energy levels @xcite . due to high rabi transition rates in the obtained dressed trap , this weak rf - field under the non - rwa regime excites population to multiple dressed manifolds and results in a decrease of the @xmath33 population at frequencies @xmath92 ( @xmath93=0,1,2 , .. ) .",
    "such excitations are not usually accessible for the trapping in rwa regime .",
    "presence of these resonances makes this trap a wonderful tool , not only to study higher order dressed state transitions , but also to incorporate more intricate and effective evaporation mechanisms hitherto not studied .",
    "using the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) technique , we have studied the dynamics of an atom cloud during the conversion of its trapping potential from a quadrupole magnetic trap to an rf - dressed potential of toroidal shape .",
    "this rf - dressed potential for the toroidal trapping of atoms is formed when atoms trapped in a quadrupole trap are exposed to an rf - field with time varying frequency and amplitude .",
    "the results of simulations have provided an insight into the processes governing the atom cloud parameters .",
    "it is found that , initially at low rf coupling strength , the evaporative cooling dominates , whereas at higher coupling strength trapping of atoms occurs in the rf - dressed potential .",
    "the predictions of the simulations have been found adequate to explain the experimental observations .",
    "the work presented in this article can be extended to study the non - equilibrium trap dynamics with more sophisticated evolution of trapping potential , including the potential evolution beyond the rotating wave approximation . using similar simulations more useful and effective",
    "evaporation and rf - dressing schemes can be explored .",
    "we thank a. srivastava for her help during the experiments .",
    "we also thank m. lad and p. s. bagduwal for providing the rf amplifier and a. k. pathak , s. tiwari and l. jain for modifications in the control system for the experiments .",
