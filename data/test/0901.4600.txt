    "turbulence has been a mystery for a long time .",
    "it has been investigated not only in basic science , including physics and mathematics research , but also in applied sciences , such as fluid engineering and aeronautics . as feynman said , turbulence is a problem `` that is common to many fields , that is very old , and that has not been solved . ''",
    "@xcite this is chiefly because turbulence is a complicated dynamical phenomenon with strong nonlinearity far from an equilibrium state .",
    "`` turbulence '' reminds one of some sketches by leonardo da vinci .",

    "the characteristics of superfluidity were discovered experimentally in the 1930s by kapitza _",
    "the hydrodynamics of superfluid helium is well described by the two - fluid model , in which the system consists of an inviscid superfluid ( of density @xmath2 ) and a viscous normal fluid ( of density @xmath3 ) with two independent velocity fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the mixing ratio of the two fluids depends on temperature .",
    "as the system is cooled down below the @xmath1 point , the ratio of the superfluid component increases , and the entire fluid becomes superfluid below about 1 k. the bose - condensed system exhibits the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath6 as an order parameter .",
    "the superfluid velocity field representing the potential flow is given by @xmath7 with boson mass @xmath8 .",
    "since the macroscopic wavefunction must be single - valued for space coordinate @xmath9 , the circulation @xmath10 for an arbitrary closed loop within the fluid is quantized in terms of the quantum value @xmath11 . a vortex with such quantized circulation",
    "is called a quantized vortex . any rotational motion of a superfluid is only sustained by quantized vortices .",
    "a quantized vortex is a topological defect characteristic of a bose ",
    "einstein condensate and is different from a vortex in a classical viscous fluid .",
    "first , its circulation is quantized and conserved , in contrast to a classical vortex whose circulation can have any value and is not conserved .",
    "second , a quantized vortex is a vortex of inviscid superflow .",
    "thus , it can not decay by the viscous diffusion of vorticity that occurs in a classical fluid .",
    "third , the core of a quantized vortex is very thin , on the order of the coherence length , which is only a few angstroms in superfluid @xmath0he and submicron in atomic becs . since the vortex core is thin and does not decay by diffusion , it is possible to identify the position of a quantized vortex in the fluid .",
    "these properties make a quantized vortex more stable and definite than a classical vortex .",
    "early experimental studies of superfluid turbulence focused primarily on thermal counterflow , in which the normal fluid and superfluid flow in opposite directions .",
    "the flow is driven by an injected heat current , and it is found that the superflow becomes dissipative when the relative velocity between the two fluids exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "feynman proposed that it is a superfluid turbulent state consisting of a tangle of quantized vortices @xcite .",
    "vinen later confirmed feynman s proposal experimentally by showing that the dissipation arises from mutual friction between vortices and the normal flow @xcite .",
    "the quantization of circulation was also observed by vinen using a vibrating wire technique @xcite .",
    "subsequently , many experimental studies have examined superfluid turbulence ( st ) in thermal counterflow systems , revealing a variety of physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of quantized vortices are nonlinear and nonlocal , so it has not been easy to quantitatively understand the experimental results on the basis of vortex dynamics .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved by schwarz , who clarified the picture of st consisting of tangled vortices by a numerical simulation of the quantized vortex filament model in the thermal counterflow @xcite . however , since the thermal counterflow has no analogy in conventional fluid dynamics , these experimental and numerical studies are not helpful in clarifying the relationship between st and classical turbulence ( ct ) .",
    "superfluid turbulence is often called quantum turbulence ( qt ) , which emphasizes the fact that it is comprised of quantized vortices .    comparing qt and",
    "ct reveals definite differences .",
    "turbulence in a classical viscous fluid appears to be comprised of vortices , as pointed out by da vinci .",
    "however , these vortices are unstable , repeatedly appearing and disappearing .",
    "moreover , the circulation is not conserved and is not identical for each vortex .",
    "quantum turbulence consists of a tangle of quantized vortices that have the same conserved circulation .",
    "looking back at the history of science , _ reductionism _ , which tries to understand the nature of complex things by reducing them to the interactions of their parts , has played an extremely important role .",
    "the success of solid state physics owes much to _ reductionism_. in contrast , conventional fluid physics is not reducible to elements , and thus does not enjoy the benefits of _",
    "reductionism_. however , quantum turbulence is different , being reduced to quantized vortices .",
    "thus _ reductionism _ is applicable to quantum turbulence .",
    "consequently , qt should lead to a simpler model of turbulence than ct .",
    "based on these considerations , research into quantum fluid dynamics has opened up new directions since the mid 1990s .",
    "one new direction has occurred in the field of low temperature physics by studying superfluid helium .",
    "it started with the attempt to understand the relationship between qt and ct @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of fully developed classical turbulence is known to obey the kolmogorov law in the inertial range .",
    "recent experimental and numerical studies support a kolmogorov spectrum in qt . following these studies ,",
    "qt research on superfluid helium has moved to important topics such as the dissipation process at very low temperatures , qt created by vibrating structures , and visualization of qt @xcite .",
    "another new direction is the realization of bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases in 1995 , which has stimulated intense experimental and theoretical activity @xcite .",
    "as proof of the existence of superfluidity , quantized vortices have been created and observed in atomic becs , and numerous efforts have been devoted to a number of fascinating problems @xcite .",
    "atomic becs have several advantages over superfluid helium .",
    "the most important is that modern optical techniques enable one to directly control condensates and visualize quantized vortices .",
    "because a series of experiments on becs clearly show the properties of quantum fluid dynamics @xcite , we shall start with this topic .",
    "what happens if we rotate a cylindrical vessel with a classical viscous fluid inside ? even if the fluid is initially at rest , it starts to rotate and eventually reaches a steady rotation with the same rotational speed as the vessel . in that case",
    ", one can say that the system contains a vortex that mimics solid - body rotation .",
    "a rotation of arbitrary angular velocity can be sustained by a single vortex . however",
    ", this does not occur in a quantum fluid .",
    "because of quantization of circulation , superfluids respond to rotation , not with a single vortex , but with a lattice of quantized vortices .",
    "feynman noted that in uniform rotation with angular velocity @xmath12 the curl of the superfluid velocity is the circulation per unit area , and since the curl is @xmath13 , a lattice of quantized vortices with number density @xmath14 ( `` feynman s rule '' ) arranges itself parallel to the rotation axis @xcite .",

    ", the boundary surface of the condensate becomes unstable and generates ripples that propagate along the surface [ fig .",

    "vortices are excitations , their nucleation increases the energy of the system . because of the low density in the outskirts of the condensate , however , their nucleation contributes little to the energy and angular momentum . since these vortices outside of the condensate are not observed in the density profile , they are called `` ghost vortices ''",

    "classical viscous fluid dynamics is described by the navier  stokes equation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the velocity of the fluid , @xmath37 is the pressure , @xmath38 is the density of the fluid , and @xmath39 is the kinematic viscosity .",

    "when @xmath41 increases and the reynolds number exceeds a critical value , the system changes from a laminar to a turbulent state , in which the flow is complicated and contains eddies .",
    "such turbulent flow shows characteristic statistical behavior @xcite .",
    "we assume a steady state of fully developed turbulence of an incompressible classical fluid .",
    "energy is injected into the fluid at a rate @xmath43 in an energy - containing range . in an inertial range , this energy is transferred to smaller length scales without dissipation . in this range ,",
    "the system is locally homogeneous and isotropic , leading to energy spectral statistics described by the kolmogorov law , @xmath44 the energy spectrum @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the kinetic energy per unit mass and @xmath48 is the wavenumber from the fourier transform of the velocity field .",

    "the inertial range is thought to be sustained by a self - similar richardson cascade in which large eddies break up into smaller eddies through vortex reconnections . in ct , however , the richardson cascade is not completely understood because it is impossible to definitely identify each eddy .      as described in sec . 2 ,",
    "most experimental studies on superfluid turbulence have examined thermal counterflow .",

    "1 , a quantized vortex has quantized circulation .",
    "the vortex core is extremely thin , usually much smaller than other characteristic length scales of the vortex motion .",

    "the vortex configuration at a given time determines the velocity field in the fluid , thus causing the vortex filaments to move .",
    "vortex reconnection needs to be included when simulating vortex dynamics .",
    "a numerical study of a classical fluid shows that close interaction of two vortices leads to their reconnection , chiefly because of the viscous diffusion of vorticity .",
    "schwarz assumed that two vortex filaments reconnect when they come within a critical distance of each other and showed that statistical quantities such as the vortex line density are not sensitive to how the reconnections occur @xcite . even after schwarz s study , it remained unclear as to whether quantized vortices can actually reconnect .",
    "however , koplik and levine directly solved the gp equation to show that two closely quantized vortices reconnect even in an inviscid superfluid @xcite .",
    "more recent simulations have shown that reconnections are accompanied by the emission of sound waves having wavelengths on the order of the healing length @xcite .",
    "schwarz numerically studied how remnant vortices develop into a statistical steady vortex tangle under thermal counterflow @xcite .",
    "the tangle is self - sustained by the competition between the excitation due to the applied flow and the dissipation by mutual friction .",

    "this relation causes quantized vortices to appear with quantized circulation .",
    "the only characteristic scale of the gp model is the coherence length defined by @xmath65 , which determines the vortex core size .",
    "the gp model can explain not only the vortex dynamics but also phenomena related to vortex cores , such as reconnection and nucleation .",
    "however , the gp equation is not applicable to superfluid @xmath0he , which is not a weakly interacting bose system .",
    "but it is applicable to bose ",
    "einstein condensation of a dilute atomic bose gas @xcite , as discussed in sec .",
    "most older experimental studies on qt were devoted to thermal counterflow .",
    "since this flow has no classical analog , these studies did not significantly contribute to the understanding of the relation between ct and qt .",
    "since the mid 1990s , important experimental studies have been published on qt in the absence of thermal counterflow , differing significantly from previous studies @xcite .",
    "the first important contribution was made by maurer and tabeling @xcite , who confirmed experimentally the kolmogorov spectrum in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "a turbulent flow was produced in a cylinder by driving two counter - rotating disks .",
    "the authors measured the local pressure fluctuations to obtain the energy spectrum .",
    "the experiments were made at three different temperatures : 2.3 k , 2.08 k , and 1.4 k. both above and below the @xmath1 point , the kolmogorov spectrum was confirmed .",
    "next was a series of experiments on grid turbulence performed for superfluid @xmath0he above 1 k by the oregon group @xcite .",
    "flow through a grid is usually used for generating turbulence in classical fluid dynamics @xcite . at sufficient distance behind the grid , the flow displays homogeneous isotropic turbulence .",
    "this method has also been applied to superfluid helium . in the oregon experiments ,",
    "the helium was contained in a channel along which a grid was pulled at constant velocity .",
    "a pair of second - sound transducers was implanted in the walls of the channel to observe vortex tangles . in combining their observations with the decay of the turbulence , the authors had to make several assumptions .",
    "the analysis is too complicated to be described in detail here .",
    "the important point is that the coupling between the superfluid and the normal fluid by mutual friction makes a quasiclassical flow appear at length scales much larger than @xmath57 and causes the fluid to behave like a one - component fluid @xcite .",
    "the line density is found to decay as @xmath66 .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the @xmath66 decay can be derived from a quasiclassical model with a kolmogorov spectrum @xcite .",
    "subsequently many experimental , theoretical , and numerical works appeared .",

    "the pioneering experiments by maurer _",
    "et al . _ and by the oregon group were performed at relatively high temperatures where the normal fluid component was significant , and so the situation is complicated because of the two - fluid behavior .",
    "here we confine ourselves to the case of pure superfluid at zero temperature .",
    "what happens to qt at zero temperature is not trivial @xcite .",
    "the first problem is the nature of the energy spectrum of the turbulence for the pure superfluid component .",
    "the second problem is the dissipation in this system .",
    "since there is no normal fluid component , any dissipative mechanism does not work at large scales .",
    "however , some dissipative mechanism should operate at small length scales .",
    "one possibility is acoustic emission during vortex reconnections . in classical fluid dynamics ,",
    "vortex reconnections cause acoustic emission . in quantum fluids , numerical simulations of the gp model",
    "show acoustic emission at every reconnection event @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism is thought not to be important in superfluid helium because of its short coherence length .",
    "another possible mechanism is the radiation of sound ( phonons ) by the oscillatory motion of the vortex cores .",
    "the third problem is how energy is transferred from large to small scales at which the dissipative mechanism operates .",
    "if the energy spectrum obeys the kolmogorov law , the energy should be transferred through a richardson cascade of quantized vortices in contrast to the classical case .",
    "vortex reconnections sustaining a richardson cascade should be less effective at size scales shorter than the mean vortex spacing @xmath57 .",

    "the solid line is the kolmogorov law @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( b )    the above arguments are chiefly limited to length scales larger than the mean spacing @xmath57 of a vortex tangle , in which the richardson cascade is effective .",
    "what happens at smaller scales where the richardson cascade is less effective ?",
    "the most probable scenario is the kelvin - wave cascade .",
    "a kelvin wave is a deformation of a vortex line into a helix , with the deformation propagating as a wave along the vortex @xcite .",
    "kelvin waves were first observed by making torsional oscillations in uniformly rotating superfluid @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "the approximate dispersion relation for a rectilinear vortex is @xmath94 with a constant @xmath95 and a cutoff parameter @xmath96 equal to the vortex core size . here",
    "@xmath48 is the wavenumber of an excited kelvin wave , which is different than the wavenumber used for the energy spectrum above . at a finite temperature ,",
    "a significant fraction of the normal fluid contains damped kelvin waves because of mutual friction .",
    "at very low temperatures , however , mutual friction does not occur and the only possible mechanism of dissipation is the radiation of phonons @xcite .",
    "phonon radiation becomes effective only when the frequency is very high , typically of the order of ghz ( @xmath97 nm@xmath98 ) .",
    "therefore , a mechanism is required to transfer energy to such high wavenumbers for kelvin - wave damping . an early numerical simulation based on the vortex filament model showed that kelvin waves are unstable to the buildup of sidebands @xcite .",
    "consequently nonlinear interactions between different kelvin wavenumbers can transfer energy from small to large wavenumbers , which constitutes a kelvin - wave cascade .",
    "this idea was first suggested by svistunov @xcite and later developed and confirmed through theoretical and numerical work by kivotides _",
    "@xcite , vinen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and kozik and svistunov @xcite .",
    "consider the nature of the transition between the richardson and the kelvin - wave cascades .",
    "turbulence at scales larger than the mean vortex spacing obeys the kolmogorov law with a richardson cascade . in this regime , the nature of individual vortices is not relevant , and the large - scale velocity field created collectively by the vortices mimics classical turbulent behavior .",
    "this regime may therefore be called classical . on the other hand , at length scales smaller than the mean vortex spacing the energy",
    "is transferred along each vortex through a kelvin - wave cascade ; this regime has no classical analog and can be called quantum .",
    "several theoretical considerations of the classical - quantum crossover have been proposed @xcite , but this topic is not yet settled and remains controversial .",
    "recently , vibrating structures including discs , spheres , grids , and wires , have been used for research into qt @xcite . despite differences between the structures ,",
    "the experiments show surprisingly similar behavior . when a classical viscous fluid steadily flows past a structure , the flow changes from laminar to turbulence in the wake as the reynolds number increases .",
    "the net drag force on the structure is often expressed in terms of the drag coefficient @xmath99 as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the projected area of the structure onto a plane normal to the flow .",
    "for laminar viscous flow , the drag is approximately proportional to @xmath102 so that @xmath103 , while turbulent flow with high reynolds number yields a drag coefficient @xmath99 of order unity .",
    "this drastic reduction in the drag force is called the drag crisis , and is closely related to the formation of the boundary layer @xcite .",
    "a boundary layer in a high velocity gradient produces eddies . however , such boundary layers do not appear in the superfluid component .",
    "another classical aspect is the effect of oscillations .",
    "the oscillatory case is more complicated than that of steady flow because a second length scale appears in addition to the linear size of the structure , namely the viscous penetration depth @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the oscillation frequency of the structure @xcite .",
    "owing to the importance of the topic in marine engineering , a number of experimental studies have been published on oscillatory classical flow past a cylinder .",
    "as laminar flow becomes unstable , the drag coefficient @xmath99 reduces to a value of order unity . however , the values of @xmath99 oscillate within the range 0.5 to 2.0 , showing a more complicated transition to turbulence than in the case of steady flow .",
    "visual observations show that vortices are formed in the wake of the oscillating cylinder .",
    "a few experimental studies have reported classical flow around an oscillating sphere .",
    "a typical experiment shows that a single vortex ring is generated and shed during each half period of oscillation @xcite .",
    "typical behavior appeared in the pioneering observation of qt for an oscillating microsphere in superfluid @xmath0he by jger _",
    "the sphere they used had a radius of approximately 100 @xmath106 m .",
    "it was made from a strongly ferromagnetic material and was magnetically levitated in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "its response to an alternating drive was observed . at low drives ,",
    "the velocity response @xmath102 was proportional to the drive @xmath107 , taking the `` laminar '' form @xmath108 with a temperature - dependent coefficient @xmath109 . at high drives ,",
    "the response changed to the `` turbulent '' form @xmath110 above a critical velocity @xmath111 . at low temperatures , the transition from laminar to turbulent response",
    "was accompanied by hysteresis .",
    "subsequently , several groups have experimentally investigated the transition to turbulence in superfluid @xmath0he and @xmath112he - b by using grids , wires , and tuning forks @xcite .",
    "these experimental studies reported some common behaviors independent of the details of the structures , including its type , shape , and surface roughness .",
    "the observed critical velocities were in the range from 1 to 200 mm / s .",
    "since the velocity was lower than the landau critical velocity of approximately 50 m / s , the transition to turbulence should come not from intrinsic nucleation of vortices but from extension or amplification of remnant vortices.he at rest usually contains remnant vortices @xcite .",
    "they are metastably pinned between the walls of the container and are established when the liquid is cooled down through the @xmath1 point to the superfluid phase . ]",
    "such behavior is seen in the numerical simulation using the vortex filament model @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows how the remnant vortices initially attached to a sphere develop into turbulence under an oscillating flow .",

    "liquid helium was seeded with solid hydrogen particles smaller than 2.7 @xmath106 m in diameter at a temperature slightly above @xmath113 , following which the fluid was cooled to below @xmath113 . when the temperature is above @xmath113 , a homogeneous cloud of the particles was seen that disperses throughout the fluid . however , on passing through @xmath113 , the particles coalesced into web - like structures .",
    "_ suggested that these structures represent decorated quantized vortex lines .",

    "the long history of research into superfluid helium has uncovered two main cooperative phenomena of quantized vortices : vortex lattices under rotation and vortex tangles in qt .",
    "however , almost all studies of quantized vortices in atomic becs have been limited to vortex lattices .",
    "this section briefly discusses qt in atomic becs .    kobayashi and tsubota proposed an easy , powerful method to make a steady qt in a trapped bec , by using precession @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the wavefunction are described by the gp equation with dissipation .",
    "first , one traps a bec cloud in a weakly elliptical harmonic potential , @xmath114,\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 exhibit elliptical deformation in the @xmath117- and @xmath118-planes .",
    "second , to transform the bec into a turbulent state , a rotation is applied along the @xmath119-axis followed by a rotation along the @xmath120-axis , as shown in fig .",
    "the rotation vector is @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the frequencies of the first and second rotations , respectively . consider the case where the spinning and precessing rotational axes are perpendicular to each other .",
    "then the two rotations do not commute and can not be represented by their sum .",
    "this form of precession is also used for turbulence in water @xcite .",
    "starting from a stationary solution without rotation or elliptical deformation , kobayashi _ et al . _",
    "numerically calculated the time development of the gp equation by turning on the rotation @xmath124 and elliptical deformation @xmath125 . by monitoring the kinetic energy and anisotropic parameters ,",
    "the system eventually becomes statistically steady and isotropic . in the steady state ,",
    "the spectrum @xmath85 of the incompressible kinetic energy per unit mass is consistent with the kolmogorov law [ fig .",
    "the inertial range which sustains the kolmogorov law is determined by the thomas - fermi radius @xmath32 and the coherence length @xmath84 .",
    "the application of a combined precession around three axes enables one to obtain more isotropic qt @xcite .",
    "the velocity field in a bec cloud can be observed by bragg spectroscopy @xcite , enabling one to obtain the energy spectrum .",
    "is the thomas - fermi radius amd @xmath126 is the characteristic length scale of the trap . ]",
    "there are several advantages of studying qt in atomic becs compared to in superfluid helium .",
    "first , one can observe the vortex configuration , probably even the richardson cascade process of vortices .",
    "in fact one can directly study the relation between the real - space richardson cascade and the wavenumber - space cascade ( the kolmogorov spectrum ) .",
    "second , one can control the transition to turbulence by changing the rotational frequencies or other parameters .",
    "for example , rotation along one axis forms a vortex lattice .",
    "if one applies another rotation , it may rotate the lattice if the frequency is low . if the frequency is high , however , the second rotation can melt the lattice into a vortex tangle .",
    "that would enable one to investigate in detail the entire transition to turbulence .",
    "third , by changing the shape of the trapping potential , one can study the effect of the anisotropy on turbulence ; a typical question is how the kolmogorov spectrum is changed when the bec becomes anisotropic .",
    "this issue is related to the transition between 2d and 3d turbulence .",
    "fourth , one can create rich qt in multicomponent becs by controlling the interaction parameters .",
    "multicomponent becs have been extensively studied and found to create many kinds of vortex structures depending on the intercomponent interaction @xcite . by using such systems",
    ", we will be able to make multicomponent qt coupled through the interaction .",
    "in this article , we have reviewed recent research on quantum hydrodynamics and qt in superfluid helium and atomic becs .",
    "research on qt is currently a key branch in low - temperature physics , attracting the attention of many scientists .",
    "it is comprised of quantized vortices as definite elements , in contrast to conventional turbulence .",
    "thus , the investigation of qt may lead to a breakthrough in understanding a mystery of nature pondered since the era of da vinci .",

    "<S> this article reviews recent developments in quantum fluid dynamics and quantum turbulence ( qt ) for superfluid helium and atomic bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> quantum turbulence was discovered in superfluid @xmath0he in the 1950s , but the field moved in a new direction starting around the mid 1990s . </S>",
    "<S> quantum turbulence is comprised of quantized vortices that are definite topological defects arising from the order parameter appearing in bose - einstein condensation . hence qt is expected to yield a simpler model of turbulence than does conventional turbulence . a general introduction to this issue and a brief review of the basic concepts </S>",
    "<S> are followed by a description of vortex lattice formation in a rotating atomic bose - einstein condensate , typical of quantum fluid dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> then we discuss recent developments in qt of superfluid helium such as the energy spectra and dissipative mechanisms at low temperatures , qt created by vibrating structures , and the visualization of qt . as an application of these ideas </S>",
    "<S> , we end with a discussion of qt in atomic bose - einstein condensates .    quantum turbulence ; quantum fluid dynamics ; quantized vortex ; superfluid helium ; bose - einstein condensation </S>"
