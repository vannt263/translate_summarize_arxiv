    "in radio astronomy , heterodyne instruments are used to detect weak radiation from an astronomical source with a very high spectral resolution @xcite .",
    "the central element of a heterodyne instrument is a mixer which has a strong nonlinear current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristic . in this article",
    "we will focus on superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) tunnel junctions since they show a highly nonlinear i - v characteristic due to the singularity in the superconducting quasiparticle density - of - states and , therefore , perfectly fulfill the needs of a high - sensitivity astronomical heterodyne receiver . for a more complete review of other mixers , like the hot - electron bolometer mixer",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "the frequency mixing limit ( i.e.  the highest detectable frequency ) in a sis mixer is set by the superconducting pair - breaking energy @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we focus on a symmetric sis mixer which uses the same superconducting material for both junction electrodes .",
    "in such a device the frequency mixing limit is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the planck constant .",
    "existing receivers almost enirely use nb - al - alox - nb junctions , because they can be reliably fabricated with high quality , i.e.  with very low subgap / leakage currents .",
    "moreover , these devices already provide a reasonably high frequency mixing limit of theoretically 1.4  thz making them interesting for applications in radio - astronomy . in order to achieve the fundamental sensitivity limit of a sis mixer @xcite ,",
    "it is crucial that the tunnel junction is embedded in a high - q tuning circuit that enables a near 100  % coupling to the sky signal . for this reason",
    "optimum embedding circuits are made of superconducting transmission lines .",
    "however , here lossless signal transport is provided only up to the superconducting pair - breaking frequency @xmath3 .",
    "up to the pair - breaking frequency of niobium of approximately 700  ghz , the embedding circuit is made of the same material like the nb junction electrodes .",
    "near quantum - limited sensitivity for such a device has been demonstrated over a broad range of frequencies @xcite . for larger frequencies for which @xmath4 , quasiparticle excitations in the embedding circuit are created due to the breaking of cooper pairs and large ohmic losses",
    "are observed which would significantly decrease the sensitivity of a mixer device . on the other hand ,",
    "heterodyne mixing above the pair - breaking frequency is not intrinsically limited by the superconducting electrode material itself , although here also quasiparticle excitations are created , absorbing a part of the detection signal .    consequently , in order to exploit the full frequency mixing range of a high - sensitivity nb sis mixer , an embedding circuit made of superconducting transmission lines with a higher superconducting pair - breaking energy than the junction electrodes are needed .",
    "e.g.  in @xcite experiments are reported where the material nbtin was used as superconducting embedding material contacted to only one electrode of the sis mixer whereas the other side of the sis junction was contacted to the good normal - conducting metal al .",
    "losses in these devices due to the normal - conducting al layer can be prevented by replacing it against nbtin @xcite resulting in nb sis junctions contacted to a full superconducting nbtin embedding circuit .",
    "an important conclusion of this earlier work was , that it turned out to be important to avoid heating effects of the electron gas of the nb junction due to blocked quasiparticle outdiffusion at the andreev trap formed between the high - gap material nbtin and the lower - gap material nb .",
    "we experimentally found the relaxation of these nonequilibrium quasiparticles in an added small normal - metal layer of au between the nb junction and the nbtin embedding circuit @xcite . in this proof - of - principle study ,",
    "the au layer had a circular shape with a diameter of several @xmath5 m , centered on the sis junction .",
    "this is not necessarily the best geometry for a practical heterodyne mixer because the large overlap of the au layer and the nbtin layer which is one of the electrodes of the radio frequency ( rf ) tuning circuit of the sis junction , causes rf signal losses , that depend on the length of the overlap .",
    "however , we have found in a different experiment , that the relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles does not depend on the particular geometry of the au layer as long as the volume of the au layer is sufficient for the relaxation @xcite .",
    "possible remaining influences of the geometry on the relaxation process could not be identified so far .    with these findings",
    "one would in principle favor , first , an au layer shape with a small overlap with the nbtin embedding circuit and , second , an au layer with a minimum volume .",
    "a shape with these properties is e.g.  a half circular shape ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ) .    in this article",
    "we present our ongoing work and focus in particular on a thorough systematic study of the relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in various circular and half - circular shaped au layers , added between the nb junction and the nbtin embedding circuit .",
    "earlier work @xcite showed a linear dependence between the volume of the au layer and the heat - transfer coefficient alpha .",
    "on further increasing the volume of the au - layer while keeping its thickness fixed to @xmath6  nm , we find in dc - measurements of the i - v characteristic a saturation in the nonequilibrium quasiparticle relaxation .",
    "this suggests an effect of the geometry on the relaxation process and we supplement our earlier findings by this new result .",
    "we reproduced our experimental results with a simple theoretical model of our device . with this model",
    "we can also consistently describe the difference in the heating of the nb electron gas of a device which we immersed in liquid helium ( lhe ) and which was characterized in a vacuum dewar . with this stage of consistency in our description , this allows us to determine the optimal nb mixer device consisting of a full superconducting nbtin embedding circuit and an au energy relaxation layer .        in sec .",

    "( [ eq:01 ] ) one assumes that the tunnel current does not disturb the physical properties of the two junction electrodes .",

    ", @xmath17 is equal to the phonon bath temperature @xmath19 .    for a quasiparticle nonequilibrium distribution due to",
    "dissipated power in the sis junction , @xmath20 . this elevated @xmath17 directly influences the fermi - dirac distribution and consequently the superconducting energy gap @xmath18 through the self - consistency relation @xcite @xmath21}{(\\epsilon^{2 } + \\delta(t_{e})^2)^{1/2}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the single - spin density of states at the fermi energy in the normal state , @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 is the debye temperature of the material , @xmath25 is the average attractive interaction potential of superconductivity describing phonon exchange between electrons @xcite and @xmath26 is the independent quasiparticle energy measured relative to the fermi energy .",
    "the temperature @xmath17 depends on the power generated by the tunneling process .",
    "the power rapidly rises for bias voltages @xmath27 . in case that this increases @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:02 ] ) implies that the relevant energy gap for the tunneling decreases leading to the possibility of back - bending @xcite ( the slope of @xmath28 becomes negative around @xmath29 ) .",
    "therefore , the slope of @xmath28 directly probes @xmath17 over the reduction in @xmath30 . in order to deal with non - idealities in the sharpness of the i - v curve",
    "compared to the ideal situation described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) , a phenomenological broadening parameter @xmath31 is introduced into the expression for @xmath13 allowing to estimate the smearing of @xmath28 around @xmath29 due to quasiparticle energy broadening @xcite , e.g.  caused by an external magnetic field which we use to suppress the josephson effect during our measurements .",
    "this magnetic field also closes the small mini - gap in the au - layer that developes due to the proximity effect .",
    "the actual value of @xmath17 depends on the energy relaxation channels in the device .",
    "the injection of hot electrons by the tunnel barrier into the junction electrodes is followed by the fast electron - electron relaxation with characteristic time @xmath32 .",
    "this process is usually fast enough so that one can assume a homogeneous effective electron temperature @xmath17 . in a closed volume where diffusion processes",
    "play no role , @xmath17 is relaxed via the slower electron - phonon relaxation with characteristic time @xmath33 . in an open volume ,",
    "like it is the case for our small au layer , diffusion processes play a role and provide an additional relaxation channel for quasiparticles .",
    "this balancing of @xmath17 via the aforementioned processes is described by the following general heat - balance equation @xcite @xmath34 +   \\frac{y}{d_{au } } r^2 \\left[t_{e}(r)-t_{ph}\\right ] = 0~.\\ ] ] its solution describes the radial temperature distribution around the sis junction in the au layer shown in fig .",

    "we distinguish between the metallic phonon system , where @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the metallic electron - phonon heat - transfer coefficient and the heat transfer to the phonon bath system ( substrate of lhe ) . in this case",
    "is @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the kapitza conductance between the metal and the substrate or between the metal and the lhe . for our interpretation",
    "it turned out that the dominating relaxation channel ( i.e.  the slowest relaxation process ) is given by the kapitza resistance , so we set @xmath43 for further calculations .",
    "furthermore , for the interpretation of our experiments , we use a second linearized heat balance equation @xmath45 here , @xmath7 is an effective heat - transfer coefficient . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq:04 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:03 ] ) , for a distributed layer of au where quasiparticle relaxation via diffusion and electron - phonon scattering occurs simultaneously , @xmath7 contains both relaxation contributions .",
    "this is in contrast to the definition of @xmath7 we used in our earlier work @xcite where @xmath7 was used to describe relaxation only via heat transfer to the phonon system . by calculating @xmath17 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:03 ] ) , the effective @xmath7 can be determined by using eq .",
    "( [ eq:04 ] ) .",

    "we have fabricated nb - al-@xmath51-nb sis tunnel junctions embedded in a nbtin - sio@xmath52-nbtin circuit with an au energy relaxation layer between the junction and the top nbtin layer .",
    "we varied the size of the au layer for a fixed thickness of @xmath6  nm and realized circular and half - circular shapes like shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] . for this paper we performed two measurements with these devices , briefly described below . in measurement # 1 we obtained i - v curves of a large number of devices in a dipstick setup , where the devices were immersed in lhe .",
    "a weak magnetic field was used to suppress the josephson effect in order to obtain only the quasiparticle current @xmath28 .",
    "we obtained the electron temperature @xmath17 as a function of dissipated power @xmath53 from our experimental data and extracted @xmath7 via eq .",

    "@xcite we included a conservative correction term of @xmath57 to the calculated @xmath7 in order to account for quasiparticle energy broadening @xmath31 . in this work",
    "we increased it to @xmath58 which leads to a better agreement with our measured data .",
    "this modification is reasonable because small changes in e.g.  the magnetic field used to suppress the josephson effect in our devices might very well lead to this slight change in the quasiparticle energy broadening correction .",
    "furthermore , we added an offset to the calculated @xmath7 equal to the heat - transfer coefficient of the nb junction alone .",
    "our theoretical results are shown as lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] and are in good agreement with the measured data shown as points .",
    "we could also reproduce this result by increasing the values for @xmath35 and @xmath44 both at the same time by 30  % but keeping the energy broadening correction term at @xmath57 .",
    "this could be attributed to possible changes in our au film parameters which were not remeasured for this work . because our fabrication process is in general very stable",
    "the modification of the energy broadening correction term is more reasonable . for our measured data as well as for the theoretical prediction",
    "we find a saturation in @xmath7 when we increase the volume by increasing only @xmath54 . on the other hand , when the volume is increased by increasing @xmath40 and possibly also @xmath54 , @xmath7 increases as well .",
    "this result is crucially important for the design of au energy relaxation layers since we find that increasing @xmath7 is limited by the value @xmath40 .    in measurement # 2",
    "we measured the i - v characteristic of a device mounted in a vacuum dewar , like it would be used in an astronomical receiver . in this case the significantly smaller kapitza conductance between au and @xmath59 results in a stronger heating effect than one would obtain for the same measurement with the device immersed in a lhe vessel where the kapitza conductance is three times larger ( values for the kapitza resistances we used can be found in @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] we show measurements of the effective electron temperature @xmath17 as a function of dissipated power @xmath53 in a device measured in the vacuum dewar and when it is directly immersed in lhe .",
    "we adjusted @xmath19 to approximately @xmath60 in the lhe vessel for better comparison since this was the bath temperature in the vacuum dewar .",
    "the dimensions of the circular au layer in the device are @xmath61 m and @xmath62 . within the framework presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:02 ] , we can consistently describe both measurements for the effective electron temperature @xmath17 against dissipated power @xmath53 . in order to relax @xmath17 towards @xmath19 and",
    "when the device is operated in the vacuum dewar , the volume of the au energy relaxation layer has to be significantly increased due to the much smaller kapitza conductance compared to the larger kapitza conductance in lhe . using our theoretical model",
    ", we find that the au cap should then have the dimensions @xmath63 m and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) for which our model yields an effective heat - transfer coefficient of @xmath66 .    like described before , a device with a half - circular au layer has practical advantages over a circular au layer .",
    "hence , translating our measurement results performed in the vacuum dewar for the device with the circular shaped au layer to a device having only a half - cicular au layer , this device should have @xmath67 m and a larger thickness @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) in order to reach @xmath70 with the same @xmath66 .     as a function of dissipated power @xmath53",
    "the plot shows two measurements , first , with the device fixed in a vacuum dewar and , second , with the device fixed in a dipstick and directly immersed in lhe . ]",
    "in our previous measurements , we found no clear evidence of a geometrical influence of the au layer on the relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that we performed our measurements in the linear regime , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] for small volumes @xmath9 .",
    "hence our conclusion was that the relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles does not depend on the geometry but only on the volume of the au layer . while this is true for the linear regime of eq .",
    "( [ eq:03 ] ) , in this work we find that this conclusion does not hold in the nonlinear regime .",
    "for the device in a vacuum dewar , in order to relax @xmath17 towards @xmath19 we find that for a circular au layer a volume of only @xmath65 is needed while for a half - circular au layer an approximately twice as large volume of @xmath69 is needed .",
    "hence , we have determined the optimum dimensions of an either circular or half - circular au energy relaxation layer to maintain a bath temperature quasiparticle distribution in the nb junction when it is connected to a full superconducting nbtin embedding circuit .",
    "in the next development step we will use our findings to fabricate sis mixer devices for 800  ghz to show if the nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution in the junction can be eliminated by the au energy relaxation layer in the same way when the device is irradiated with a strong rf signal .",
    "if this is successful we will continue this development towards a sis mixer for 1.1 thz .",
