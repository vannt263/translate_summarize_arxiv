    "in the last few years , great progress has been made towards the understanding of the out of equilibrium dynamics of _ classical _ systems with slow dynamics and aging effects .",
    "experiments in several glassy materials such as polymer glasses,@xcite spin - glasses,@xcite orientational glasses,@xcite simple liquids like glycerol@xcite and gels , @xcite have shown that all these systems share an extremely slow dynamics at low temperatures .",
    "although some aspects of the dynamic evolution as the precise scaling laws or the dependence on cooling rates vary from system to system , all the examples mentioned above are characterized by the existence of a non - equilibrium low temperature phase with _",
    "aging effects_. this means that measurements show a strong dependence upon the time elapsed since its preparation by a thermal quench or annealing from a high temperature phase .",
    "needless to say , the standard equilibrium approach is not suited to describe such a phenomenology .    in order to describe the spin - glass case ,",
    "a number of theoretical methods have been exploited , ranging from scaling arguments based on coarsening ideas;@xcite phenomenological models founded on particular assumptions on the structure of phase space;@xcite analytical solutions to models with infinite - range interactions;@xcite and numerical simulations of finite and infinite dimensional models.@xcite all of these approaches have succeeded in capturing some of the effects observed experimentally .",
    "importantly enough , the solution of simplified models with infinite range interactions has been fruitful for several reasons :",
    "( i ) it has shown that indeed a large family of such models do capture aging effects that resemble , at least qualitatively , the experimental observations .",
    "( ii ) it has provided a general framework to analyze the non - equilibrium dynamics with new predictions , like scaling laws for the time - delayed correlation function and asymptotic violations of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , that are not restricted to the infinite dimensional case . some of these have been confirmed by numerical studies of more realistic models@xcite and will be probed experimentally soon.@xcite ( iii ) it has allowed to extend the _",
    "connection@xcite between mean - field theories of disordered systems and the mode - coupling theory of super - cooled liquids@xcite to the low temperature glassy phase.@xcite this is most welcome since many of the similarities observed in the behavior of real glasses of very different origin can now be understood theoretically .",
    "( iv ) problems of a more general nature such as the dynamics of manifolds in a random quenched environment , relevant to the description of e.g. the pinning of the flux lattice by disorder in dirty high @xmath1 superconductors,@xcite can be studied in a similar way.@xcite the dependence on the internal dimension of the manifold can be included in the formalism and the analysis yields , among other results , dynamic scaling laws for the displacements with aging effects .",
    "the studies we have mentioned so far are mostly concerned with the analysis of _ classical _ systems .",
    "this treatment is in general justified since , in many cases , the critical temperature at which the transition to the  glassy phase \" occurs is sufficiently high as to make quantum effects irrelevant . nevertheless , in many cases of practical interest",
    ", the critical temperature can be lowered by tuning an external parameter .",
    "experimental realizations of this situation are given by insulating magnetic materials@xcite such as liho@xmath2y@xmath3f@xmath4 and randomly mixed hydrogen - bonded ferro - antiferroelectric crystals of the rb@xmath3 ( nh@xmath4)@xmath5h@xmath6po@xmath4 type ( known as radp).@xcite    theoretical studies addressing the effects of quantum fluctuations in disordered media have been considered over the last twenty years .",
    "a variety of techniques including replica theory,@xcite renormalization group@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite have been employed in order to understand the _",
    "static _ properties and critical behavior of quantum systems such as quantum rotors@xcite , transverse field ising models in finite dimensions@xcite and mean - field systems like the sherrington - kirkpatrick model in a transverse field.@xcite    from the study of _ classical _ glassy systems described in the first paragraph , one knows that at low temperatures their dynamics becomes so slow that the systems are not able to reach thermal equilibrium at any experimentally accessible time .",
    "the same occurs regarding numerical simulations of large systems .",
    "it is then plausible that even at very low temperatures , say @xmath7 , with only quantum fluctuations driving the dynamics , the materials and/or models will need an unaffordable long time to reach equilibrium and that the relevant evolution will be characterized by non - equilibrium effects .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that certain glasses in the limit of very low temperatures have aging effects@xcite and hence the approaches based on the assumption of equilibration have a restricted domain of application . instead",
    ", one should necessarily start from a quantum _ dynamic _ description in order to obtain sensible information about the systems .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this problem has not been theoretically tackled , from a microscopic point of view , yet .",
    "the question then arises as to how do quantum fluctuations modify the _ real time _",
    "dynamics of glassy systems . in this paper",
    ", we treat the case of a disordered model in contact with a thermal quantum bath .",
    "our first aim is to present a general framework that allows us to study the real time dynamics of a system with quantum _ and _ thermal fluctuations starting from an arbitrary initial condition . in the case of classical models",
    "this is most easily done within the langevin approach .",
    "one generally starts by postulating that the dynamics of the microscopic variables is given by a stochastic langevin equation .",
    "the noise and friction terms account for the bath - system interaction . a path - integral formulation of the generating functional , known as the martin - siggia - rose formalism@xcite ( msr ) , yields an elegant and simple formulation which is particularly well suited for problems with disorder . however , the generalization of this procedure to the quantum case is far from being straightforward .",
    "the langevin equation does not seem to be a good starting point since , being phenomenological , it can not be quantized in an obvious way.@xcite in other words , it is not clear how to make the langevin approach compatible with the intrinsic microscopic dynamics of a quantum system .",
    "the approach we use here results from the combination of different techniques which have been intensively discussed in the literature and successfully applied to a wide range of phenomena .",
    "essentially , it consists of the schwinger and keldysh@xcite closed - time path - integral formalism applied to a system in contact with a thermal bath , combined with the integration of the bath variables leading to the feynman and vernon influence functional.@xcite a subsequent integration over the disorder gives the quantum analogue of the msr generating functional for disordered systems .",
    "though the formalism allows us to consider general cooling procedures or / and various temperature variations , we shall not study involved thermal histories here but concentrate instead on a quench from a configuration associated to the disordered phase .    for the sake of definiteness we focus on a system",
    "whose classical counterpart , the so - called `` @xmath0-spin spherical spin - glass model '' , has been studied in great detail .",
    "this model is described by a potential energy @xmath8 = - \\sum_{i_1 < \\dots",

    "let us attempt a short review of the behavior of the _ classical _ @xmath0-spin models .    in its ising version",
    "it was first introduced by derrida in relation with the random energy model.@xcite several studies of its static properties , in particular using replicas , followed .",
    "@xcite kirkpatrick and thirumalai@xcite studied the equilibrium dynamics ,  la sompolinsky,@xcite and remarked that the dynamic equations , in the high temperature phase , are those appearing as @xmath11 models in the mode - coupling theory of super - cooled liquids developed to describe the glass transition.@xcite    the spherical version , where a time - dependent lagrange multiplier is introduced to enforce the spherical constraint @xmath12 , was first studied by jones , kosterlitz and thouless@xcite for @xmath13 .",
    "its statics is fully solvable either by using replicas  a replica symmetric ansatz is exact  or through a direct calculation .",
    "its dynamics@xcite is also fully solvable and it renders explicit the fact that the model is formally related@xcite to the @xmath14 model in the large @xmath15 limit and dimension @xmath16 . in the classical limit , it is then a toy model for ferromagnetic domain - growth . in the quantum case",
    "one feels tempted to relate it to coarsening in quantum systems .",
    "the analysis of the spherical model for @xmath17 is due to crisanti and sommers,@xcite who also studied the equilibrium dynamics  la sompolinsky in collaboration with horner.@xcite in the classical limit and at the static level , this model is the prototype spin - glass solved by a parisi one - step replica symmetric ansatz .",
    "still at the classical level and in the large @xmath15 limit , one derives exact evolution equations that exhibit a first order  discontinuous  dynamic transition at @xmath18 . above @xmath18 , as in the ising case , one recovers the mode - coupling equation for model @xmath11.@xcite below @xmath18 it is well - known that the dynamic approach used in ref.[@xcite ] is incorrect.@xcite the dynamics in the low - temperature phase was solved in ref .",
    "[ ] showing that the dynamics of mean - field spin - glasses strikingly resembles that of real systems .",
    "in the spin - glass phase the evolution is intrinsically out of equilibrium and the systems age in similar way to the one observed in experiments .    in order to define the model at the quantum level",
    ", we need to specify the dynamics of the variables @xmath19 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a kinetic term of the form @xmath20 where the dot denotes a time - derivative .",

    "we pay particular attention to the departure of correlation and response functions from stationarity and , we search for one of the hallmarks of a glassy phase , namely , violations of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",

    "we discuss the closed - time path - integral formalism of keldysh and schwinger and the coupling of the quantum system to a quantum heat bath .",
    "we obtain a generating functional with an effective action that takes into account the effect of the coupling to the bath . in three appendices",

    "the method is similar to the one used in the classical case when manipulating the martin - siggia - rose generating functional .",
    "the general scenario for the real - time dynamics of this system is discussed in section [ scenario ] .",
    "it is inspired by the behavior of the classical counterpart but some generalizations are necessary . in section [ equilibriumdynamics ] the equations and their solution in the paramagnetic phase",

    "the dynamic equations in the glassy phase are studied .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics is shown to survive quantum fluctuations in a finite region of the phase diagram .",

    "the modification of fdt needed to construct an ansatz to solve these equations and its relation to effective temperatures are discussed in section [ generalfdt ] . finally , in section [ conclusions ] we present a summary of our results , our conclusions and some ideas as to how to continue investigating along the lines here proposed",
    ". a short account of some of these results has appeared in ref .",

    "@xcite in order to set the notation we briefly present it in section  [ generalframework ] .",

    "thence , if a formal relation between fdt - violations and the replica @xmath425 exists at the quantum level is an interesting question that deserves further study .",
    "the last remark we wish to make about the fdt violations is that in the classical case it has been related to the production of entropy during evolution.@xcite it would be desirable to see whether such a connection also holds at the quantum level .",
    "concerning the formalism here developed , it can be extended in several directions .",
    "on the one hand , one would like to study models with a spatial structure such as the one associated to the motion of a _ manifold _ of internal dimension @xmath430 in a random quenched potential .",
    "this quantum problem has many interesting applications and , in the case of an embedding space with a large dimensionality can be treated , for example , within a dynamic gaussian variational approach.@xcite on the other hand , it would be extremely interesting to study the opposite limiting case of low dimensions and analyze , for example , the real - time dynamics of the ising chain in a transverse field .",
    "in addition , one could investigate the effect induced on the dynamics by different environments like considering sub or super ohmic baths , non - linear couplings and even baths of a completely different nature as those generated by spin variables.@xcite    the martin - siggia rose generating functional for classical stochastic processes takes a particularly simple form if the time - space is enlarged to a superspace by introducing a couple of grassmann coordinates , and the variables of the problem are encoded in a superfield.@xcite this can also be done for systems with disorder.@xcite the dynamic equations are then written in terms of a single super - correlator that encodes the auto - correlation and response .",
    "the equilibrium theorems , viz .",
    "causality , invariance under time - translations and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , follow from the symmetries of the msr effective action written in this way.@xcite the supersymmetric formulation of the classical dynamics has been helpful to find a solution of mean - field like models with an internal dimension like the problem of the manifold in a random media but , most importantly , it has highlighted the formal connection between the out of equilibrium formalism and the replica approach to the statics .",
    "it would be very interesting to identify a supersymmetric structure in the quantum problem , probably at the level of the keldysh - schwinger generating functional .",
    "this could provide a means to establish a relation between the quantum dynamic formalism here presented and the quantum replica approach .",
    "we believe that an analytical study of aging effects along the lines presented in this paper will be relevant in the understanding of realistic glassy systems .",
    "indeed , even at very low temperatures , where quantum effects are important , a glass is a non - equilibrium system that evolves over many orders of magnitude in time.@xcite aging effects , demonstrating this non - equilibrium evolution , have been observed with , for example , burning hole experiments in organic glasses ( see ref .  [ ] and references therein ) . in the context of magnetic disordered systems with explicit quenched disorder like liho@xmath2y@xmath3f@xmath4",
    ", a great effort has been devoted to the study of the quantum phase transition and the dynamics close to the quantum critical point .",
    "it would be interesting to perform dynamic measurements in the glassy phase of these compounds to search for aging effects and check if a scenario as the one here discussed with , for example , a two step relaxation of correlation functions and fdt violations is also present .",
    "another area of research where the relevance of quantum effects in the very low temperature dynamics is currently under study are systems of magnetic nano - particles such as @xmath431fe@xmath6o@xmath432 particles ( maghemite ) embedded in a silica matrix .",
    "the search for a non - stationary evolution in samples at small concentrations ( @xmath433 ) has given a negative result .",
    "@xcite however , in experiments performed at higher temperatures ( where quantum effects are not expected to play an important role ) with samples with a larger concentration ( @xmath434 ) much of the phenomenology of spin - glasses has been recovered.@xcite it is then licit to ask whether there is a region in the temperature - concentration parameter - space where the systems exhibit aging driven by quantum fluctuations . in the area of magnetic nano - particles , a notion of an effective temperature greater than the temperature of the environment was advocated in ref . [ ] and it would be interesting to explore the connection with effective temperature defined in this paper .",
    "we have chosen to comment on three kind of materials where effects like the ones obtained in this article might be observed .",
    "surely enough , many other glassy systems with or without explicit disorder might exhibit a similar phenomenology .    *",
