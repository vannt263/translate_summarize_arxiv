    "it is instructive to first consider the ground state ( gs ) of the system . to minimize the dominant pairwise interaction which exists between first nearest neighbors , an `` in - out '' relative configuration",
    "must be adopted for a given pair .",
    "further neighbor interactions , whilst not necessarily insignificant , will not alter this ordering rule . because @xmath0 is odd , if one attempts to propagate the rule around a ring , a defect must always be ultimately formed , consisting of a frustrated `` in - in '' or `` out - out '' arrangement , resembling a magnetic soliton defect,@xcite as illustrated in fig .",
    "the frustrated defect can hence exist at positions p@xmath4 , as indicated by circles , and we will refer to spins which constitute a soliton as `` defected spins '' .",
    "it is important to note that the system can generally support only odd numbers of solitons    similar solitons are found in linear 1d chains of ising spins where two domains of opposite phase meet,@xcite a result of a two - fold degenerate antiferromagnet - like gs . in our ring system , the gs possesses an _ intrinsic _ local frustration , much like a 1d ising chain with periodic boundary conditions where setting @xmath0 = odd imposes this `` twist '' in the local order parameter .",
    "there are also @xmath0 possible soliton positions .",
    "calculation of the net zeeman energy @xmath16 shows that this is the gs , which is hence 2@xmath0-fold degenerate .",
    "an interesting analogy exists here between the spin ring system and the mbius loop , a planar strip possessing only one side due a twisted topology.@xcite following the antiferromagnetic order parameter around the ring , one finds it must invert once each cycle at the defect , which represents the topological kink of the mbius loop .",
    "( this analogy would only stand completely true for a spin ring possessing only 1@xmath17 nearest neighbor interactions , however , as we will show , this is the dominant interaction defining the system s behavior , hence the same qualitative behavior is expected . )    for now , we simply consider that each spin possesses an intrinsic switching astroid of a given type . as for a linear 1d chain system,@xcite it is anticipated that dipolar interactions result in a local instability at a frustrated defect , its two constituent spins being more willing to flip their orientations than non - defected spins , and local stability elsewhere .",
    "flipping an unstable spin , e.g. by applying a suitable magnetic field ( not large enough to reverse any stabilized spins ) , acts only to move the soliton , creating an energetically equivalent gs if the applied field is subsequently removed .",
    "however , for identical spins on the linear 1d chain , an applied field can not preferentially flip one defected spin over the other , due to symmetry , hence a directional `` pressure '' can not be established in the system . whilst qd",
    ", e.g. in the intrinsic switching fields of the spins , can locally break the symmetry , this produces no net directionality in the system . as can be seen by simple geometrical considerations , the employment of a curved chain , as for the ring system , potentially overcomes both of these issues , by imposing asymmetry when a uniform global applied field is present .",
    "it is hence possible to favour the switching of one defected spin over the other , given qd is not too strong . under a uniform applied field , two defect spins",

    "the field is incremented in anticlockwise angular steps of @xmath25 : this allows for a sufficient angular resolution , and for even division of the @xmath26 range , maintaining symmetry between @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for a given simulation step",

    "once the defect completes a full circuit of the system , the whole system has undergone a global spin flip transformation from its initial configuration , as the order parameter `` twist '' is swept around .",
    "a total rotation of @xmath58 is required to achieve this .",
    "we find the same non - trivial behavior throughout the range of @xmath59 , the phase of the spin flipping decreasing(increasing ) as @xmath54 increases(decreases ) due to the profile of the sw astroid .",

    "the non - trivial interval has a width @xmath61 indicating how the operation of the system relies crucially on 1@xmath17 nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "we have hence established that such a spin ring system may be used for the manipulation of a well - defined soliton defect . whilst the system possesses symmetry in its interactions , as for a linear chain , the _ anticlockwise _ rotating applied field provides the required chirality for unidirectional angular soliton propagation with a _ clockwise _ sense .",
    "it is of course possible to set the initial applied field angle @xmath62 to any direction and , in particular , a direction that first favors reversal of spin @xmath24 , rather than @xmath46 , from the initial spin configuration of fig .",

    "in such a case , the soliton will initially take a single step with the _ same _ sense as @xmath40 from position p@xmath21 to position p@xmath63 , however , as @xmath40 continues to rotate the behavior previously described is resumed .",
    "furthermore , reversing the sense of rotation of @xmath40 to clockwise produces a complementary reversal in the sense of propagation of the soliton , which can be understood by symmetry .",
    "hence , the soliton may be translated to any position in any angular direction .",
    "the scheme also works for alternative switching models and has been tested using an ising switching astroid .",
    "fundamentally , the scheme requires that spins possess switching astroids which vary as a function of net field direction , that are also offset in angle from each other such that switching can be accessed for individual spins in turn .",
    "hence , the scheme should work experimentally for any realisable bistable nanomagnet type .",
    "this is particularly important when considering that the switching astroid of a sw nanomagnet loses four - fold rotational symmetry at finite temperature , the switching threshold for applied fields approaching the easy axis becoming reduced relative to that along the hard axis.@xcite the same qualitative behavior is hence expected .",
    "next we consider a more realistic situation in which quenched disorder qd is present in the system .",
    "we follow similar model studies and implement this as a distribution in the spins switching behavior.@xcite for a given realization , we generate the values @xmath34 from a psuedo - gaussian distribution with mean = 1 and standard deviation @xmath64 .",

    ", failure is likely for a given realization due to the increased probability of spins that are loose , which behave trivially under @xmath54 .",
    "typically , a loose spin is allowed to flip when not defected by interactions , nucleating an additional pair of solitons in the system .",
    "the evolution of the system then appears as the trivial high field regime discussed in section 3.1 . as @xmath64 increases the probability of such behavior increases .",
    "for @xmath69  0.4 , there often exists increasing numbers of pinned spins too : the combination of loose and pinned spins can result in erratic behavior in which soliton pairs are periodically nucleated and annihilated on the ring , with no meaningful evolution . for @xmath38  0.55 and @xmath69  0.4 , the most erratic behavior is found , due to an average balance of pinned and loose spins , resulting in a balanced probability of various different failure modes . it should be noted that for @xmath73  0.4 , realizations become increasing unphysical , with negative values of @xmath34 becoming common , hence we do not explore this range .    within the @xmath68  1 region in fig .",
