    "thomson s theorem states that electric charge density on a set of fixed conductors at static equilibrium is distributed on the surface of the conductors in such a way that the interior electric field is zero and the surface electric field is normal to the surface . here",
    "we will prove an analogous theorem on the magnetic field and current distribution in ideal conductors .",
    "we find that a stationary current density must distribute itself on the surface of the conductors in such a way that the interior magnetic field is zero while the surface magnetic field is perpendicular to both the current density and the surface normal .",
    "when w.  thomson ( lord kelvin ) derived his theorem in 1848 a magnetic analog did not seem interesting since conductors with zero resistivity were unknown .",
    "since the discovery of superconductivity in 1911 this has changed and stationary current distributions in type i superconductors , below the critical field , indeed obey our theorem . in spite of this the theorem is not stated , hardly even hinted at , in the literature .",

    "electromagnetic energy can be written in a number of different ways . here",

    "relevant energy expressions are then , @xmath2 here the first form is always valid while the two following assume quasi statics , _ i.e. _  essentially negligible radiation .    according to thomson s theorem , the electric charge on a set of conductors distributes itself on the conductor surfaces thereby minimizing the electrostatic energy .",

    "a derivation based on a variational principle can be found in the textbook by kovetz @xcite .",
    "a different approach also based on a variational principle , is presented below .",
    "thomson s result is widely known and is useful in many applications .",
    "e.g. _  been used to determine the induced surface charge density , and in the tracing and the visualization of curvilinear squares field maps @xcite .",
    "other applications range from interesting teaching tools @xcite to useful computational methods such as monte carlo energy minimization @xcite .",
    "there are various similarities between electrostatics and magnetostatics , or quasi - statics , but for resistive media the magnetic field due to current dissipates . for _ perfect _ , or",
    "_ ideal _ conductors , however , there should be something corresponding to the magnetic version of thomson s theorem . indeed , below we will prove a theorem analogous to that of thomson : _ magnetic energy is minimized by surface current distributions such that the magnetic field is zero inside while the surface field is normal to the current and the surface normal . _",

    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig.minmagtheorem ] .      neither thomson s theorem nor our minimum magnetic energy theorem are formally valid for conductors in constant external fields . in both cases , however , such a situation can be regarded as a limiting case . in the case of thomson",
    "s theorem one can include two large , distant , and oppositely charged parallel conducting plates .",
    "a small system of conductors between these can then approximately be regarded as in an electric field that approaches a constant external field at large distance . in a similar way",
    "the set of perfect conductors can be thought of as inside two large perfectly conducting helmholtz coils ( tori ) which provide an approximately constant external magnetic field at large distance .",
    "the fact that there is an energy minimum theorem for the magnetic energy of ideal , or perfect , conductors , analogous to thomson s theorem , is not entirely new . in an interesting , but difficult and ignored , article by karlsson @xcite such",
    "a theorem is stated .",
    "karlsson , however , restricts his theorem to conductors with holes in them . in the electrostatic case charge conservation",
    "prevents the energy minimum from being the trivial zero field solution . in our magnetic ideal conductor case",
    "the corresponding conservation law is the conservation of magnetic flux through a hole .",
    "as long as _ one _ conductor of the system has a hole with conserved flux there will be a non - trivial magnetic field . to require that all conductors of the system have holes , as karlsson does , therefore seems unnecessarily restrictive .",

    "variation of the functional gives the london equation , @xmath61 bada - majs , chooses not to point out that this classical derivation of flux expulsion is in conflict with frequent text book statements to the effect that no such classical result exists .",
    "further work by bada - majs _ et al . _   on variational principles for electromagnetism in conducting materials",
    "should be noted .",
    "finally we should mention the pioneering work by woltjer @xcite on energy extremizing properties of , so called , force free magnetic fields . in plasma physics",
    "a lot of further work has been done in that tradition .",
    "it has , however , not been concerned with currents and fields inside or on the boundary of bounded domains separated by vacuum , as we are here .",
    "we now know that magnetic energy minimum occurs when current flows only on the surface and the magnetic field is zero inside .",
    "let us consider a perfectly conducting sphere surrounded by a fixed constant external magnetic field . here",
    "we will calculate the surface current needed to exclude the magnetic field from the interior and how much the total magnetic energy @xmath62 is then reduced .",
    "in order to exclude a constant external field @xmath63 from its interior the currents on the sphere must obviously produce an interior magnetic field @xmath64 , thereby making the total field @xmath65 zero in the interior .",
    "we will use that a constant field is produced inside a sphere by a current distribution due to rigid rotation of a constant surface charge density @xcite .      for the total magnetic field to have a finite energy @xmath62 we can not assume that the constant external field extends to infinity . instead of using helmholtz coils to produce it we simplify the mathematics and produce our external field by a spherical shell of current that is equivalent to a rigidly rotating current distribution on the surface .",
    "this can be done in practice by having as set of rings representing closely spaced longitudes on a globe with the right amount of current maintained in each of them .",
    "such a spherical shell of rigidly rotating charge produces a magnetic field that is constant inside the sphere and a pure dipole field outside the sphere ( see fig .",

    "we assume that the small sphere in the middle of the big one has radius @xmath75 and that it also produces a magnetic field by a rigidly rotating charged shell on its surface .",
    "we denote its dipole moment by @xmath76 so that its total energy would be , @xmath77 if it was far from all other fields , according to our previous result ( [ eq.energy.mag.field.rot.sphere ] ) .",
    "we now place the small sphere inside the large one and assume that @xmath76 makes an angle @xmath78 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 the total energy of the system is now , @xmath81 where the coupling ( interaction ) energy is , @xmath82 this integral must be split into the three radial regions : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the calculations are elementary using spherical coordinates .",
    "the contribution from the inner region is , @xmath86 the middle region , where there is a superposition of a dipole field from the small sphere and a constant field from the big one , contributes zero : @xmath87 .",
    "the outer region gives @xmath88 .",

    "the total magnetic energy of the system discussed above is thus , @xmath90 we assume that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are positive quantities .",

    ", the energy lowering is now found to be : @xmath101 this result is independent of the radius @xmath102 of the big sphere introduced to produce the constant external field .",
    "it shows that the energy lowering corresponds to three times the external magnetic energy in the volume @xmath103 of the perfectly conducting interior sphere .",
    "in 1933 meissner and ochsenfeld @xcite , discussing their experimental discovery , stated that it is understandable that an external magnetic field does not penetrate a superconductor but that the expulsion of a pre - existing field at the phase transition can not be understood by classical physics .",
    "this statement has since been repeated many times .",
    "we are not aware , however , of any deeper investigations of what classical electromagnetism predicts regarding the behavior of perfect conductors in this respect , at least not prior to the work of karlsson @xcite and bada - majs @xcite .",
    "our theorem strengthens the conclusion of bada - majs that a magnetic field is expelled according to classical electromagnetism .",
    "hirsch @xcite has pointed out that the meissner effect is not explained by bcs theory .",
    "here we briefly speculate on the microscopic physical mechanism of this expulsion .",
    "assume that a resistive metal sphere is penetrated by a constant magnetic field .",
    "lower the temperature until the resistance vanishes .",
    "how does the metal sphere expel the magnetic field , or equivalently , how does it produce surface currents that screen the external field ? according to forrest @xcite this can not be understood from the point of view of classical electrodynamics since in a perfectly conducting medium the field lines must be frozen - in .",
    "this claim is motivated thus : when the resistivity is zero there can be no electric field according to ohm s law , since this law then predicts infinite current .",
    "but if the electric field is zero the maxwell equation , @xmath104 , requires that the time derivative of the magnetic field is zero .",
    "hence it must be constant .",
    "this argument is flawed since ohm s law is not applicable .",
    "inertia , inductive or due to rest mass , prevents infinite acceleration .",
    "instead the system of charged particles undergoes thermal fluctuations and these produce electric and magnetic fields .",
    "these fields accelerate charges according to the lorentz force law . in the normal situation",
    "the corresponding currents and fields remain microscopic .",
    "when there is an external magnetic field present the overall energy is lowered if these microscopic currents correlate and grow to exclude the external field . according to standard statistical mechanics",
    "the system will then eventually relax to the energy minimum state consistent with constraints .",
    "we note that alfvn and flthammar @xcite state that `` in low density plasmas the concept of frozen - in lines of force is questionable '' .",
    "another argument by forrest @xcite is that the magnetic flux through a perfectly conducting current loop is conserved .",
    "since one can imagine arbitrary current loops in the metal that just lost its resistivity with a magnetic field inside , the field must remain fixed , it seems .",
    "is is indeed correct that the flux through an ideal current loop is conserved , but the actual physical current loop will not remain intact unless constrained by non - electromagnetic forces .",
    "there will be forces on a loop of current that encloses a magnetic flux that expands it @xcite .",
    "this is the well know mechanism behind the rail gun , see _",
    "e.g. _  essn @xcite .",
    "all the little current loops in the metal will thus expand until they come to the surface where the expansion stops . in this way the interior field is thinned out and current concentrates near the surface .",
    "so , the flux is conserved through the loops , but the loops expand .",
    "it was noted early in the history of superconductivity that the meissner flux expulsion is necessary if superconductors obey normal thermodynamics .",
    "gorter and casimir observed that the final thermal equilibrium state of a superconductor must be independent of whether the external magnetic field existed inside the body prior to the phase transition or if it was added after the transition already had occurred .",
    "our theorem indicates that it is perfectly natural that an interior magnetic field is expelled in the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it is amazing that the theorem derived here has not been stated before .",
    "zero resistivity conductors have been known since 1911 and zero resistivity is also considered a good approximation in many plasmas , so the ideal , or perfect conductor , is a well known concept and its magnetic energy minimum ought to be of great importance .",
    "it is clear from results above , and further motivated by the examples in the appendix below , that type i superconductors below their critical field obey the theorem , and the reason that these only have surface current and zero interior field is thus simply minimization of magnetic energy .",
    "naturally there is some other energy involved that is responsible for the zero resistivity itself but apart from being implicitly assumed constant in our variations it is irrelevant to the current investigation .",
    "in this appendix we present further evidence in support of our theorem . the purpose of the calculations presented here is to illuminate and elucidate the physical meaning and the mechanisms behind the expulsion of current and magnetic field from the interior of ideal conductors .",

    "changing @xmath139 from zero to one means changing the distribution of these circular wires from a bulk distribution in the sphere to a pure surface distribution , while maintaining constant current . according to a result by greiner @xcite a system will tend to _ maximize _ its magnetic energy when the conductor geometry changes while currents are kept constant .",
    "this has also been discussed in essn @xcite . in conclusion , if currents are kept constant the magnetic energy ( [ eq.lagr.energy.thick.rot.shell ] ) will tend ( thermodynamically ) to a stable equilibrium with at a _ maximum _ value and we note that this corresponds to a pure surface current @xmath73 .",
    "* case of constant angular momentum : * assume now that we pass to the hamiltonian ( canonical ) formalism .",

    "it is notable that _ both _ the assumption of constant current and the assumption of constant angular momentum lead to a pure _ surface current density _ as the stable equilibrium .      to further illustrate our theorem we present here three explicit solutions for current distributions and magnetic fields that minimize the magnetic energy",
    "we do not repeat the solution for a torus since it is a bit lengthy and has been published several times already , probably first by fock @xcite , but , independently , several times since then , see _",
    "e.g._. karlsson @xcite , however , was probably the first to notice that the solution minimizes magnetic energy for constant flux .",
    "dolecek and de launay verified experimentally that a type i superconducting torus behaves exactly as the corresponding classical perfectly diamagnetic system for field strength below the critical field . here",
    "we treat three cases all involving a constant external field . for a cylinder , perpendicular to the field , and for a sphere ,",

    "we assume that the external constant magnetic field points in the @xmath159-direction and that the cylinder axis coincides with the @xmath128-axis .",
    "there will then be no dependence on the @xmath128-coordinate so the magnetic field is , @xmath160 moreover , due to the symmetry of the system , the @xmath128-component of the magnetic field must be zero , @xmath161 these assumptions and constraints transform eq .",

    "let us consider the boundary conditions .",
    "as @xmath164 , the magnetic field must approach the external one : @xmath165 .",
    "furthermore , since the magnetic field is zero inside the perfect conductor , one concludes from eq .",
    "( [ magnetic_2 ] ) that the vector potential vector must be constant inside the cylinder .",
    "therefore , the solution is , @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "the magnetic field outside the cylinder becomes , @xmath168 which implies that , @xmath169 the magnetic field on the cylinder s surface determines the surface current according to eq .",
    "( [ eq.surf.curr.mag.field ] ) , so we get , @xmath170 the total current obtained through integration of the surface current is zero as expected , otherwise the energy would diverge .",
    "a more detailed analysis on this problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "similar calculations can be performed for a superconducting sphere with radius @xmath102 in a constant external magnetic field pointing in the direction of the @xmath128-axis . as for the cylinder case , eq .",
    "( [ curl ] ) is considerately simplified using the symmetries of the system . since the external constant magnetic field points along the @xmath128-axis",

    "starting from the magnetic energy functional we have made finite element calculations of the current and magnetic field produced when a perfectly conducting cube is placed in a ( previously ) constant field .",

    "the calculations verify the results of the variational principle : current density and magnetic field become zero inside the cube and the surface current density adjusts to achieve this . in figures [ cubesurfcurrentt ] and [ cubesurfcurrents ] we show results for the current distribution of the surface of the cube as seen first from the top ( the direction of the external field ) and then from the side .",
    "one observes that the current density concentrates along the edges that form a closed path round the cube .",
    "we also calculated the magnetic flux through the circular surface enclosed by the equator of the enclosing sphere , which we take to have radius @xmath185 and to produce the constant magnetic field @xmath186 in the interior , when empty .",
