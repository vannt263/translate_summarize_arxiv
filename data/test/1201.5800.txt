    "metamaterials are artificial composite materials which possess unusual electromagnetic properties not normally found in natural materials",
    ". electromagnetic properties of nanostructured metamaterials in the optical range are one of the foci of interest in modern electromagnetics . traditionally , metamaterials and metasurfaces composed of small individual resonant inclusions are realized as periodical arrays .",
    "however , most recently , random or amorphous metamaterials start to attract attention , see refs .",
    "this is due to novel technological possibilities to manufacture amorphous structures cheaply and on a large scale , using advanced self - assembly techniques .",
    "in addition , effects of strong spatial dispersion ( often undesirable ) can be in some cases suppressed in disordered structures .",
    "it is generally accepted that the electromagnetic properties of both regular and random arrays of scatterers are quite similar if the distances between inclusions are electrically small .",
    "the main difference in electromagnetic response comes from scattering on the lattice inhomogeneities .",
    "this apparently results in additional loss in amorphous metamaterials , and for this reason regular metamaterial lattices have been the preferred choice if low - loss response is desired .",
    "however , it appears that in metamaterial structures exhibiting resonant responses in several modes , the effects due to position randomness of inclusions are more complicated . in a recent paper  @xcite by helgert et al .",
    "reflection and transmission properties of regular and random ( amorphous ) planar arrays of cut - wire particles were studied both numerically and experimentally .",
    "specially introduced position disorder of individual scatterers allowed to study the effect of distortion of periodicity on the electromagnetic response of the array .",
    "it was found that position randomness drastically affects the electromagnetic behavior at the electric resonance , but makes little impact at the array properties near the magnetic resonance of the particles .",
    "these results were validated by numerical simulations and confirmed in posterior work @xcite .",
    "the authors of paper @xcite put forward a hypothesis that the discovered dramatic difference between scattering properties in electric and magnetic modes is caused by difference in electromagnetic interactions between particles in different modes .",
    "it was based on an observation that magnetic dipoles as well as electric quadrupoles do not generate tangential electric fields in the array plane , and it was assumed that this means that magnetic scatterers are not interacting with each other , so that the exciting field acting on a single particle is solely the external illumination . on the other hand , the electric - dipole scatterers interact strongly and the exciting field is affected by positional disorder , which leads to resonance broadening and damping .",
    "however , from the duality principle it is known that in fact magnetic dipole particles interact via their magnetic fields exactly as strongly as electric dipoles interact via their electric fields , which means that the phenomenon discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite must have some other physical reasons .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the phenomenon of resonance damping and broadening theoretically and explain the strong differences in resonance broadening in different resonant modes . to this end , we analytically study the effect of positional randomness on electromagnetic behavior of grids of resonant particles which can exhibit both electric and magnetic resonant responses .",
    "we introduce a simple model , which allows us to analyze the reflective , transmitting , and absorptive properties of multi - resonant grids , both in the regular and amorphous states . the theory is confirmed by numerical simulations using an example of the same metasurface as that studied in ref .",
    "the results reveal the mechanisms of resonance broadening and damping in amorphous structures and explain the earlier discovered differences in the cases of electric ( symmetric ) and magnetic ( anti - symmetric ) resonances . understanding physical phenomena which define the differences between effective electromagnetic responses of regular and disordered metamaterials is urgently needed before the emerging amorphous metamaterials can find applications .",
    "developing analytical models of disordered structures will allow the design and optimization of future composite materials with desired performance .",
    "let us consider an optically dense planar array of optically small resonant particles excited by normally incident plane waves .",
    "we assume that the distance between the particles in the grid @xmath0 is smaller than the wavelength .",
    "we are interested in the case when each particle exhibits both electric and magnetic responses , that is , both electric and magnetic moments are induced by local electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "we also assume that bi - anisotropic magnetoelectric coupling is either forbidden due to the particle symmetry or it is negligible .",
    "many widely - studied infra - red and optical metamaterial structures like the cut - wire pairs considered in ref .",
    "@xcite belong to this class . in this paper",
    "we consider only electric and magnetic dipole moments of particles , neglecting quadrupoles and higher - order moments , concentrating on the influence of array randomness on the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "relative strengths of dipolar and higher - order effects in cut - wire pairs have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "assuming for simplicity that no cross - polarized dipole moments in the array plane are induced ( the particles have the form of discs or squares , for example ) and considering the excitation by normally incident plane waves , we can write the relations between the induced electric dipole moment @xmath1 , magnetic dipole moment @xmath2 , and the incident fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 as scalar relations",
    "p=_ee(e_inc + _ ee p ) , m=_mm(h_inc + _ mm m)momentshere @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of individual inclusions , respectively .",
    "parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called _ interaction constants _ and they measure contributions of the fields created by all other particles of the array into the local field @xmath9 exciting each particle ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "the interaction constants for electric and magnetic dipoles are related simply as _",
    "mm=1_0 ^ 2 _ ee where @xmath10 is the wave impedance of the surrounding space .",
    "fields created by magnetic dipoles do not contribute to the electric local field exciting electric dipoles because the tangential component of the electric field of the magnetic dipole grid equals zero in the array plane .",
    "likewise , fields scattered by electric dipoles do not excite magnetically polarizable particles positioned in the same plane .",
    "most often , both moments are actually induced in the same particles , but the two modes have resonances at different frequencies .",
    "next , we calculate the plane - wave electric fields created by the surface averaged electric current sheet @xmath11 and the magnetic current sheet @xmath12 ( the harmonic time dependence assumption is of the form @xmath13 ) : e^e_ref = -_0 j_e , h^m_ref = -1 j_m eehme^m_ref = -_0 h^m_ref , e_ref = e^e_ref+e^m_ref ehhere @xmath14 and @xmath15 are reflected electric fields created by the induced electric and magnetic currents @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath18 is the reflected magnetic field created by the induced magnetic current @xmath17 .",
    "solving for the induced dipole moments in terms of the incident fields and using and we find the reflection and transmission coefficients in the simple form r = = r_e + r_m = i_0 2 a^21-_ee - i 2 _ 0 a^21-_mm rt=1+r_e - r_mthere we have used the plane - wave relation between the electric and magnetic incident fields : @xmath19 .",
    "the two partial reflections coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to the fields created by the induced electric and magnetic currents , respectively . since @xmath7 has the dimension of @xmath22 and @xmath8 has the dimension of @xmath23 , it is convenient to multiply and divide the reflection coefficients by @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the result is r_e = i k_0 a 2 1- tenr_m =- ik_0 a 2 1- tmnwhere @xmath26 is the wave number in the surrounding space .",
    "the normalized dimensionless interaction constants are the same for both electric and magnetic particles , and we denote them as @xmath27 : = _ 0 a^3 _",
    "ee=_0 a^3 _ mm    let us assume a simple lorentz - type resonant response model of individual particles .",
    "this type of resonant response is very common and approximates very well the particle response near their resonances .",
    "let us write down the _ inverse _ values of the normalized polarizabilities to make it easy to discuss the radiation loss factor : = ( a_e)^-1-ik_0 ^ 3 a^36inv_ee = ( a_m)^-1 -ik_0 ^ 3 a^36inv_mmhere @xmath28 model the dissipation losses in the particle ( in respective modes ) , while the last imaginary term is due to the scattering ( re - radiation of power ) loss @xcite . in case of regular or `` totally random '' ( on the wavelength scale ) grids",
    "there is no scattering loss , when the array period is smaller than the wavelength . in this case",
    "spherical - wave scattering from individual particles is suppressed by interactions between the particles in the array . correspondingly , the imaginary parts of the interaction constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 contain terms proportional to @xmath29 which compensate the corresponding terms in the inverse polarizabilities ( see e.g. ref .",

    "scatter individually , and there is no corresponding term in the interaction constants : be_amorphin the quasi - static limit @xmath30 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "next , we substitute these interaction constants and the lorentz particle polarizabilities and in the general formulas for the reflection coefficients and . for regular or totally random ( on the wavelength scale ) arrays we get r_e regular= ik_0 a2a_e_0e^2-^2 -i_e - ia_er_m regular =- ik_0 a2a_m_0m^2-^2",
    "-i_m - ia_mhere @xmath31 denotes the resonant frequency shifted due to interactions between the particles in the grid . in the quasi - static approximation for the real part of the interaction constant @xmath32 . for amorphous grids",
    "we get r_e amorph= ik_0 a2a_e_0e^2-^2 -i_e - ik_0 ^ 3a^3 a_e - ia_er_m amorph= - ik_0 a2a_m_0m^2-^2 -i_m - ik_0 ^ 3a^3 a_m - ia_m    let us consider the case when electric and magnetic resonances occur at different frequencies . then in the vicinity of one of the resonances the non - resonant moment varies weakly with the frequency and we can find a simple estimation of the resonant curve width ( on the field - strength scale ) : 2_e , m regular=_e , m+ for regular grids and 2_e , m amorph=_e , m+k_0 ^ 3a^3 a_e , m+for amorphous grids .",
    "we now see that if the condition _ 0e , m_e , ma_e , m+conditionis satisfied , near the corresponding resonant frequency @xmath33 the effect of inclusion position randomness is negligible , and the response of regular and amorphous structures is nearly the same .",
    "physically , this condition means that absorption ( the first member of the left - hand side ) and coherent plane - wave reflection ( the second member on the left ) dominate over scattering ( the right - hand side term ) .",
    "the above relation shows that this is the case of high dissipative losses , low resonance strength , and small electrical size of the unit cell .",
    "note that for the case of negligible absorption , this condition simply tells that scattering loss is negligible in random arrays if the distance between particles is optically very small ( @xmath34 ) .    from the above results we can conclude that the effect of strong widening of the resonant curve of the electric - dipole mode and hardly any effect of array randomness on the magnetic mode discovered in ref",
    ".  @xcite can be due to two reasons :    1 .",
    "at the frequency of the magnetic resonance the grid is practically homogeneous on the wavelength scale ( `` totally random '' ) .",
    "then the scattering term cancels out just like for periodical grids , and there is no difference in the resonant curve widths for regular and amorphous layers .",
    "2 .   at the magnetic resonance",
    "the particles are considerably more lossy and weaker excited than at the electric resonance , that is , is satisfied near the magnetic resonance but not satisfied near the electric - mode resonance .",
    "as an example we consider the cut - wire pair structure which was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . a unit cell of the infinite regular array",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figmodel ] .",
    "the dimensions are the same as in ref .",
    "the square lattice has the period of @xmath35  nm along two transverse directions .",
    "the width of the cut - wire pairs in both lateral directions is @xmath36  nm . the height of each gold pair is @xmath37  nm . the gap between the two elements in each pair equals @xmath38  nm and it is filled with a material with the relative permittivity equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the structure is placed on top of a substrate with the permittivity of @xmath40 .",
    "the permittivity of gold is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    and : magnetic polarizability of the same particle [ figalpha ]    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]         first we calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for the regular array using the full - wave numerical simulator ansoft hfss . substituting the numerical data for reflection and transmission coefficients in and and using the quasi - static approximation for the real part of the interaction constants @xmath41",
    ", we extract the polarizabilities of individual inclusions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figalpha ] , and it is apparent that the array has electric and magnetic resonances in different frequency regions , as expected .",
    "in fact the array is weakly bi - anisotropic due to the presence of the substrate ( omega - type magnetoelectric coupling  @xcite ) , which has been neglected in the theory and in the parameter extraction .",
    "we have checked that this approximation is valid by repeating the simulations and parameter extraction for the same array in free space .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ figalphafree ] and they show that this simplifying assumption is reasonable : the substrate effect is quite small .",
    "behavior of the extracted electric and magnetic polarizabilities is very close to the canonical lorentz - type resonant response .",
    "scattering losses which appear in transition from regular to amorphous grids we model by the randomness parameter @xmath42 , where unity corresponds to the case where the scattering loss is completely compensated _ ( regular array ) _ and @xmath43 means that the scattering loss is not compensated at all _ ( amorphous array , each inclusion scatters individually)_. transition from regular to amorphous state we model modifying the interaction constant as follows : = \\{}-r_ni k_0 ^ 3a^3+i k_0a betaewhich corresponds to a continuous transition from to with @xmath44 changing from unity to zero .",
    "it should be noted that for simplicity the randomness factor @xmath44 is assumed to be the same for both electric and magnetic interaction constants .",
    "due to differences in resonant frequencies , this means that the same value of @xmath44 may correspond to somewhat different degrees of geometrical randomness of particle positions .",
    "next we investigate how the reflection , transmission , and extinction change in transition from regular to amorphous states , using the analytical formulas and with the extracted values of the polarizabilities and the interaction constant . figs .",
    "[ figrtcomp ] and [ figecomp ] show the randomness effects .",
    "one can see that the developed simple model gives very good agreement with the experimental and numerical data from ref .",
    "@xcite . electrical response of the grid is strongly influenced by randomness , while close to the magnetic resonance there is almost no dependence on randomness .",
    "the reason for this phenomenon is the difference in the ratio of the absorption and scattering losses .",
    "[ figecomp ] shows that in the periodical case the absorption is much stronger at the magnetic resonance than at the electric one .",
    "higher losses are mainly due to larger imaginary part of gold permittivity , which is more than two times higher at the magnetic resonance : @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    in addition , for the case of the grid in free space ( fig .",
    "[ figalphafree ] ) we have fitted the numerically extracted polarizability curves to the lorentz model and and extracted parameters @xmath28 and @xmath47 .",
    "this allowed us to find the values in inequality .",
    "at the resonant frequency of the electric polarizability we find that the left - hand side equals @xmath48 while the right - hand side equals @xmath49 .",
    "scattering effects are clearly dominating and position randomness changes the array response quite significantly . at the resonant frequency of the magnetic polarizability",
    "the left - hand side reads @xmath50 , while the right - hand side equals @xmath51 . in this case",
    "the terms are of the same order and the randomness effect is much weaker . note that condition is a simple approximation which assumes that the two resonances are sharp and well separated . in this particular example , in the frequency region of the magnetic resonance the electric dipoles in fact give a significant contribution to the total absorption and coherent reflection .",
    "in this paper we have developed a simple model which explains the electromagnetic effects in transition from regular to random states of resonant particle arrays .",
    "we have derived a general condition under which randomizing particle positions gives only negligible effects on the reflection and transmission coefficients and explained the earlier discovered dramatic differences in resonance damping for electric and magnetic modes of particles .",
    "we have also shown that the physical phenomena leading to the resonance damping in amorphous structures are the same for electrically or magnetically polarizable particles .",
    "the widening of the resonances takes place due to additional scattering losses , which are compensated in the case of electrically dense periodical grids .    studying transition to the amorphous state for a particular example of cut - wire pairs",
    "we have found that the reason for the much weaker resonance widening and damping in the magnetic mode is strong absorption in that frequency range .",
    "when scattering losses are much smaller than the dissipation losses , they make little impact on the total extinction . on the contrary , at the higher - frequency electric resonance scattering losses are stronger than the dissipation ones , which leads to strong resonance damping and distortion in the random case .",
    "in other situations , different transition effects in different resonant modes can also be caused by differences in the electrical size of the unit cell . in the considered example , the array period is comparable with the wavelength , thus , even for geometrically random positions of the particles with respect to the cell centers , the array can not be made homogeneous on the wavelength scale .",
    "our findings can have important implications in understanding the physical differences in electromagnetic responses of regular and amorphous structures , in design of various metamaterial structures for such applications as subwavelength imaging , control of thermal radiation , microwave , terahertz and optical absorbers , and others . using the developed model it is possible to predict and engineer the effects of randomness ,",
    "relaxing conventional requirements on strong periodicity and make use of inexpensive self - assembly techniques in production of metamaterials .",
    "this study has been done as a student research project within the aalto university course on analytical modeling in applied electromagnetics .",
    "one of the authors ( st ) wants to acknowledge enlightening discussions with c. rockstuhl within the frame of the eu - funded fp7 project nanogold ."
