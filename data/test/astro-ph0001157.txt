    "have recently published a very detailed account of the most massive stars in the ( relatively ) nearby giant h  ii region m17 . the present project ( paper i , this work , and future work ) seeks to provide a large sample of massive star clusters with which to study the young and massive stellar content in the galaxy .",
    "this sample builds on the detailed visual studies of the galactic ob associations @xcite and provides a bridge to studies of young stellar objects in star forming regions .",

    "@xmath4 25.4 , 0.2 .",
    "@xcite determined w42 to be at the `` near '' kinematic distance ( 3.7 kpc for @xmath5 8 kpc ) and hence somewhat less luminous than earlier estimates @xcite . in this series of papers",
    "we shall follow a suggestion of dr .",
    "robert kennicutt ( private communication ) that `` giant '' means that more than @xmath6 lyman continuum ( @xmath4 lyc ) photons are inferred to be emitted per second from the h  ii region .",
    "this is about ten times the luminosity of the orion nebula and roughly the number emitted from the hottest _",
    "single _ o3-type star .",
    "as these stars are not found in isolation , there is an implication that a `` giant '' h  ii region contains some minimum of _ multiple _ o - type stars . in light of our new distance estimate ( see  4 ) , w42 probably falls below this limit being perhaps a few times more luminous than the trapezium in orion .",
    "our target list was originally based on eleven of the most luminous giant h  ii regions from the study of @xcite who tabulated their lyc output derived from radio continuum measurements and kinematic distance estimates .",

    "@xmath0 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , @xmath1 ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) , and @xmath2 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) images of w42 were obtained on the nights of 29 august 1998 and 01 , 02 may 1999 with the f/14 tip  tilt system on the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) 4 m blanco telescope using the two facility imagers cirim ( 1998 data ) and osiris , the ohio state infrared imager / spectrometer ( 1999 data ) .",
    "spectroscopic data were obtained on the night of 02 may 1999 using the f/14 tip  tilt system at the blanco telescope with osiris .",
    "cirim and osiris are described in the instrument manuals found on the ctio web pages ( www.ctio.noao.edu ) . for osiris , see also @xcite .",
    "the tip - tilt system is described by @xcite . the tip  tilt system uses three piezo  electric actuators to move the secondary mirror at high frequency in a computer controlled feed  back loop which corrects the natural image centroid motion .",
    "osiris employs 0.16@xmath13 pixels and cirim 0.21@xmath13 pixels .",
    "all basic data reduction was accomplished using iraf .",
    "each image / spectrum was flat  fielded using dome flats and then sky subtracted using a median combined image of five to six frames . for w42 itself , independent sky frames were obtained five to ten arcminutes south of the cluster .",
    "standard stars used the median combination of the data for sky .",
    "the osiris 1999 may images were obtained under photometric conditions and in @xmath14 0.5@xmath13 to 0.6@xmath13 fwhm seeing ( with the tip  tilt correction ) .",
    "total exposure times were 270  s , 135  s , and 135  s at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the individual @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 frames were shifted and combined ( figure  [ w42i ] ) , and these combined frames have point sources with fwhm of @xmath14 0.6@xmath13 , 0.7@xmath13 , and 0.6@xmath13 at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "dophot @xcite photometry was performed on the combined images .",
    "the flux calibration was accomplished using standards 9170 and 9172 from @xcite which are on the las campanas observatory standard system ( lco ) .",
    "the lco standards are essentially on the cit / ctio system @xcite , though color transformations exist between the two systems for redder stars .",
    "the standards were taken just before the w42 data and within 0.16 airmass of the airmass for w42 ; no corrections were applied for these small differences in airmass .",
    "aperture corrections using 11 pixel radius apertures were used to put the instrumental magnitudes on a flux scale .",
    "stars brighter than about 10th magnitude are expected to be a few percent non - linear on the osiris images .",
    "we have included the 1998 cirim data for such stars since the count levels for the cirim images were in the fully linear regime ( no linearity correction needed ) .",
    "the zero point to the cirim photometry was determined by comparing the instrumental magnitudes of stars in common to the osiris and cirim images .",
    "the cirim @xmath15band photometry includes a color correction term in order to make a transformation on to the cit / ctio system ( paper i ) .",
    "the osiris data was placed on the cit / ctio system by making small corrections ( @xmath16 10 @xmath17 ) to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 magnitudes based on linear fits to the magnitude differences as a function of color for stars in common to the cirim and osiris images .",
    "uncertainties for the final @xmath18 magnitudes include the formal dophot error added in quadrature to the error in the mean of the photometric standards ( including the transformation to osiris magnitudes for the cirim data ) , and the error in aperture corrections used in transforming from the dophot photometry to osiris magnitudes .",
    "the latter errors dominate and were derived from the scatter in the measurements of four to seven relatively uncrowded stars on the mosaic frames . the sum ( in quadrature ) of the aperture correction and standard star uncertainties is @xmath19 0.018 , @xmath19 0.023 , @xmath19 0.019 mag in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the dophot errors ranged from approximately @xmath19 0.01 mag to an arbitrary cut  off of 0.2 mag ( stars with larger errors were excluded from further analysis ) .",
    "the flat  field illumination was not uniform .",
    "a smooth gradient with full range of about 10@xmath17 was present .",
    "corrections for this gradient were made based on observations of a standard star taken over a 49 position grid covering the array .",
    "the spectra of three of the brightest four stars in the center of w42 were obtained with a 0.48@xmath13 wide slit ( oriented ew ) in 0.7@xmath13 fwhm seeing and divided by the spectrum of hr  6813 ( a1v ) to remove telluric absorption features .",
    "br@xmath20 absorption in hr  6813 was removed by eye by drawing a line across it between two continuum points .",
    "one dimensional spectra were obtained by extracting and summing the flux in a @xmath19 2 pixel aperture ( 0.64@xmath13 wide ) .",
    "the extractions include background subtraction from apertures centered 1.0@xmath13 on either side of the object .",

    "this is confirmed below through @xmath3band spectroscopy which shows that the central massive star has largely cleared away its birth cocoon , but two of the next brightest stars have not .",
    "@xcite observed w42 in the mid and far infrared .",
    "their analysis revealed two distinct sites of star formation toward w42 .",
    "one , g25.4se is located at 3.7 kpc from the sun ( accounting for a sun to galactic center distance of 8 kpc ) , while the other , g25.4nw is probably located at about 9.6 kpc .",
    "lester et al . found a 10  unresolved source located at ra ( 2000 ) @xmath24 , dec ( 2000 ) @xmath25@xmath26 which is coincident with g25.4se .",

    "the latter color was transformed as described in  3.1.3 .",
    "the cluster stars defined below in  3.1.1 and shown as _",

    "this possible offset will not affect the conclusions in this paper regarding the cluster stars .",
    "the relationship for the intrinsic colors of classical t  tauri stars ( pre  main sequence stars ) @xcite is also shown for reference .",
    "the adopted reddening law is from @xcite .      by separating the stars in figure  [ cmd ] based on radial position",
    ", we can better define the central cluster relative to the surrounding field . in figure  [ surf ] , we plot the radial surface density of stars centered on the position of the bright central star , w42  # 1 (  3.2 ) .",
    "we also plot the radial surface density for stars with @xmath2 @xmath32 14 mag , for which the number counts are more nearly complete ( see below ) .",
    "the surface density becomes approximately uniform at a radius of @xmath33 , continuing up to 50@xmath13 .",
    "it then begins to fall rapidly at the edge of the array ( _ dashed vertical line _ ) as expected due to the rectangular shape of the field .",
    "taking these radii as representative , we divide the cmd into regions with 0@xmath34 30@xmath13 , 30@xmath34 50@xmath13 , and @xmath35 50@xmath13 , as shown in figure  [ cmdrad ] .",
    "these represent the central cluster , a background annulus , and the region of the array where edge effects are important to the radial number counts .",
    "the range of color and brightness in figure  [ cmdrad ] overlaps for stars in the cluster and background regions .",
    "a distinct blue sequence can be seen in the 0@xmath34 30@xmath13 cluster cmd which appears to merge smoothly with other stars in the 30@xmath34 50@xmath13 cmd . clearly the cluster can not be completely extracted from the surrounding field based on radial position alone . in order to further enhance the cluster sequence , we defined a background cmd using the 30@xmath34 50@xmath13 region and accounting for the area difference between this annulus and the central region .",
    "the background cmd was binned in 0.5 mag color  magnitude bins .",
    "we then randomly selected and subtracted stars from the cluster in equal numbers from bins matching the background cmd .",
    "the resulting cmd is shown in figure  [ cmdsub ] .",
    "the corresponding colors for these stars are plotted as _",
    "open circles _ in figure  [ cc ] .",
    "most of the brightest stars in the central cluster fall along an essentially vertical track as expected for hot stars . the average color of",
    "the brightest seven of these stars is @xmath29 @xmath4 0.637 which corresponds to an extinction at 2.2   of @xmath36 1.07 mag ( @xmath7 @xmath37 10 mag ) using the interstellar reddening curve of @xcite and an intrinsic @xmath29 @xmath4 @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "many other stars appear more reddened , typically up to @xmath29 @xmath14 2 with some as high as 3.8 . a star with @xmath29 @xmath4 2 and",
    "intrinsic @xmath29 @xmath4 0 would have @xmath36 3.2 mag ( @xmath7 @xmath37 32 mag ) .",
    "it will be useful in discussing the w42 cluster below to have an estimate for the zero age main sequence ( zams ) transformed into the @xmath2 vs. @xmath29 plane .",
    "we have constructed such an estimate using the model results of @xcite .",
    "the models give bolometric luminosities ( ) and effective temperatures ( ) for stars of a given mass as they begin their evolution on the zams .",
    "using relationships for spectral type vs.  @xcite , visual bolometric correction ( bc@xmath39 ) vs. effective temperature @xcite , @xmath40 vs. spectral type @xcite , and @xmath29 vs. spectral type @xcite , we transform the  and  to the @xmath2 vs. @xmath29 cmd .",
    "a small correction has been made in an attempt to place the @xmath29 colors from @xcite onto the cit / ctio system .",
    "the @xcite colors are basically referred to the system of @xcite with newly defined colors involving @xmath1 ( johnson used no @xmath1 filter ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that interpolating an @xmath1 magnitude from the observed @xmath0 and @xmath2 values gives a very good estimate of the observed @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "@xcite found no discernible color correction between the saao system and that of @xcite .",
    "we have therefore used the transformation of @xcite between the saao system and cit / ctio to transform the @xmath29 colors given by @xcite .",
    "these corrections are at most one percent and hence negligible compared to the measurement uncertainties and scatter due to differential reddening .    the zams cmd is shown in figure  [ cmdsub ] for a particular distance ( 2.2 kpc ) which is discussed in  4 .",
    "the values plotted in figure  [ cmdsub ] are listed in table  [ tabzams ] .",
    "these values may be compared to those given by @xcite .",
    "there is generally good agreement as a function of .",
    "this is expected since the same models and colors were used in both cases .",
    "there are systematic differences at the @xmath14 @xmath19 0.3 mag level for @xmath41 as a function of spectral type since the spectral type vs.  relation adopted here @xcite is different than that used by @xcite who used the relation given by @xcite .",
    "these differences do not affect the conclusions of  4.3 since the resulting @xmath41 for the spectral type in question ( o5o6 ) is within 0.1 mag in both cases .",
    "the @xmath3band luminosity function ( klf ) is shown in figure  [ klf ] . neglecting the last five bins where the counts appear to be incomplete and the first 3 bins where the counts may be better described as uniform , the @xmath3band counts are well fit by a power  law with index 0.4 ( log@xmath42n @xmath4 0.4 @xmath43 @xmath2 + constant ) .",
    "we estimated the completeness of the klf by performing artificial star experiments .",
    "initially , we attempted to add stars to the original @xmath3band image , but even adding 10@xmath17 of the observed klf resulted in recovered luminosity functions much less complete than the observed one .",
    "this is due to the high spatial density of the cluster . to avoid this problem",
    ", we constructed complete artificial frames and analyzed them in the same way as the original frame . anticipating the result , we used the spatial density distribution of the stars on the @xmath3band image with @xmath44 14 mag ( figure  [ surf ] ) to generate the positions of stars on the artificial frames .",
    "the input luminosity function was constructed from two components , a uniform distribution from 8.5 @xmath45 10.5 , and a power ",
    "law for 10.5 @xmath46 19.5 .",
    "the total number of stars was set by the flux on the @xmath3band image , less a uniform background component determined from the sky frame .",
    "this should be conservative regarding the number of stars since the strong nebular flux is included .",
    "this latter aspect may be balanced somewhat by the fact that the artificial frames did not include variable extinction and nebular emission .",
    "the total @xmath3band flux in figure  [ w42i]@xmath47 is 6.0 mag , not including the bright saturated star in the se corner of the frame .",
    "the total flux of the average actual input luminosity function ( figure  [ fake ] ) was 5.9 mag which can be compared to the total flux in observed stars ( figure  [ klf ] ) , @xmath48 6.18 mag .",
    "we constructed 10 artificial frames by randomly sampling the spatial distribution and luminosity functions .",
    "dophot was run on each frame and the recovered stars matched to the input lists .",
    "the average recovered luminosity function , input luminosity function , and completeness fraction are shown in figure  [ fake ] .",
    "the general shape and distribution of the recovered stars in figure  [ fake ] suggest the experiments are a fair test of completeness of the original frame . from the same input and recovered star lists , we also show the luminosity functions and completeness fraction for the stars located at 0@xmath3430@xmath13 .",
    "see figure  [ fake30 ] .",
    "tests were also made to check whether somewhat steeper power  laws were also consistent with the observed klf .",
    "this might be the case if the crowding were sufficient to `` hide '' many fainter stars .",
    "artificial star experiments analogous to those above ( including the same uniform component ) but with a power  law component of 0.5 are not consistent with the data . a single power ",
    "law component of this steepness produces more star light than is necessary to account for the observed total flux and produces too many stars in the recovered luminosity function at fainter magnitudes if it is required to produce approximately the correct numbers at brighter magnitudes .",
    "the spectra of the targets w42  # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 are shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "the final signal  to  noise in the three spectra is typically 80105 , 7595 , and 5578 for w42  # 1 , w42  # 2 , and w42  # 3 , respectively and is higher on the red end than the blue end for all three .",
    "the brightest star in the central cluster , w42  # 1 ( @xmath49 8.8 mag ) , shows characteristic o star features @xcite .",
    "these include ( 2.069  and 2.078 ) emission , ( 2.1155 ) emission , br@xmath20 ( 2.1661 ) absorption , and ( 2.1891 ) absorption . comparison to the standards presented by @xcite results in @xmath3band spectral type of ko5-o6 .",
    "these stars typically have mk spectral types of o5 to o6 .",
    "the present classification system laid out by @xcite does not have strong luminosity class indicators . still , the ( 2.06 ) and br@xmath20 features can be used to approximately distinguish between dwarf+giants on the one hand , and supergiants on the other : the supergiants tend to have emission or weak absorption in these lines .",
    "the spectrum of w42  # 1 shown in figure  [ spec ] has been background subtracted with nearby apertures to account for the nebular emission seen in projection toward the star .",
    "the apparent absorption feature at the position of br@xmath20 and absence of a feature at ( 2.06 ) ( which might indicate a poor subtraction of the nebular contribution ) , suggests that w42  # 1 is a dwarf or giant star .",
    "in contrast to w42  # 1 , the spectra of w42  # 2 and # 3 show only emission features at ( 2.06 ) and br@xmath20 .",
    "these spectra have also been background subtracted with nearby ( 1.0@xmath13 ) background apertures .",
    "we believe the strong emission remaining after this subtraction is related to the local environment in these stars ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the dense stellar cluster evident in figure  [ w42i ] surrounded by intense nebulosity leaves no doubt that this is a young object still emerging from its birth environment at the edge of its parent molecular cloud .",
    "the cluster appears to have emerged by clearing the foreground material to the west ; darker regions with fewer stars remain toward the east .",
    "there is a suggestion of photoevaporated regions on the edge of the cloud to the east similar to those seen in m16 @xcite and ngc  3603 @xcite .",
    "this is particularly evident in figure  [ w42i]@xmath50 .",
    "this picture is consistent with the co line maps of @xcite , who found the peak brightness temperature of the associated molecular cloud to be offset to the east of the w42 ( g25.4se ) h  ii region ( see their figure  8) .",
    "higher spatial resolution images and in nebular lines are in order to further study the interaction and impact of the ionizing cluster on the molecular cloud interface .",
    "the process of clearing the local environment is still on  going , clumps of dark material are seen in projection against the photoionized h  ii region ( e.g. sw of the cluster center ) . in  3.1.2 , the extinction to the brightest stars on the cluster sequence was found to be @xmath51 @xmath4 1.07 mag .",
    "this value can be taken as representative of the foreground extinction to the cluster , and indicates a @xmath52 magnitude of approximately 18 for w42  # 1 .",
    "this is consistent with the non  detection of the cluster on the dss plates .",
    "a few stars remain after subtracting the `` background '' component from the cmd (  3.1.1 ) , but these are more likely in the foreground since the extinction toward them is as low as @xmath51 @xmath14 0.3 mag .",
    "there are a host of very red objects indicated in figures  [ w42i ] , [ cmdrad ] , and [ cmdsub ] .",
    "such colors are suggestive of young stellar objects ( yso ) in the context of an embedded stellar cluster emerging from its parent cloud .",
    "the observed colors of known populations of pre  main sequence stars ( pms ) and more heavily embedded protostars appear to lie on / occupy rather well defined sequences / regions in observational color space ; and their colors , which are redder than usual stellar photospheres have been successfully modeled as arising from excess emission produced by circumstellar disks @xcite and envelopes @xcite . like normal stars , pms objects may be seen through foreground extinction , further reddening their colors .",
    "deeply embedded protostars may have colors with or without excess emission , but typically suffer large extinction due to the dense envelope surrounding them @xcite .",
    "obviously , protostars too may suffer additional foreground extinction .    the @xmath31 vs. @xmath29 color  color diagram is most useful in assessing whether any particular star may have excess emission .",
    "the diagram distinguishes between normal stellar colors which are seen through a column of dust , hence making them redder , and a contribution which is due to emission ( reprocessed stellar light from circumstellar envelope and/or accretion luminosity from a circumstellar disk ) . @xcite and @xcite have shown that disks can provide a source of excess emission to the normal stellar colors . in figure  [ cc ] , we have plotted the classical t tauri sequence ( ctts ) from @xcite along with reddening lines for the interstellar reddening law of @xcite .",
    "the former locus may be understood as arising from disk luminosity and projection effects ( e.g , lada & adams 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "the near infrared colors of weak lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) are similar to normal stars @xcite .",
    "these stars exhibit spectra which suggest they have disks , but the disk contribution to the near infrared colors is negligible .",
    "the herbig aebe stars which are higher mass analogs to the ctts show similar colors to the ctts but extend to generally larger @xmath29 excess and with a larger contribution to the colors from circumstellar extinction @xcite .",
    "the colors of these objects have been fit by circumstellar envelope models in which the excess emission arises from reprocessed stellar light via dust heating and re - radiation @xcite , or alternatively , from circumstellar disks with central holes @xcite .",
    "we also show the reddening lines for a main sequence o star and m giant ( see s3.1 ) which can be taken as approximate guides for the expected colors for normal stars along sight lines to the inner galaxy .",
    "the _ black squares _ in figure  [ cc ] represent all the stars in figure  [ w42i ] for which @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 colors were measured .",
    "the _ open circles _ represent the stars in the `` background subtracted '' central cluster (  3.1.1 ) .    the w42 cluster stars ( including w42  # 1 ) occupy a rather tight sequence at modest reddening in figure  [ cc ] as expected for young massive stars seen through different columns of obscuring material . at larger reddening ( @xmath29 , @xmath31 @xmath4 1,2 )",
    ", there is a larger dispersion of colors .",
    "there are also a number of stars which lie significantly beyond the reddening band for normal stars in the region of pms stars and protostars as discussed above .",
    "two of these objects are w42  # 2 and # 3 .",
    "spectra for these objects are shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "neither spectrum shows stellar absorption features , though both exhibit emission at br@xmath20 or ( 2.06 ) after background subtraction (  2 ) .",
    "accounting for the foreground extinction to w42  # 1 , both w42  # 2 and # 3 lie in a region of the color  color plot occupied by luminous protostars and herbig aebe stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that herbig aebe stars might be recently `` uncovered '' protostars given the large overlap in the color ",
    "color plot for the two objects .",
    "we believe that the position of w42  # 2 and # 3 in the color  color plot combined with their emission ",
    "line spectra , strongly suggests they are also luminous ysos .",
    "the absence of absorption features is consistent with veiling due to the excess emission seen in figure  [ cc ] . in the case of w42  # 2",
    ", the residual br@xmath20 emission may be due to a circumstellar disk ; spherical or envelope distributions to the circumstellar material are also possible .",
    "higher spectral resolution data on the br@xmath20 line in this object will be required to rule out models of one nature or the other . in w42  # 3 , the presence of emission but",
    "no br@xmath20 could be due to imperfect subtraction .",
    "w42  # 3 has closer neighbors making the subtraction of the background more difficult .",
    "if the emission seen in projection toward w42  # 3 is due to a compact h  ii region , then the emission may be coming from a region closer to the star than the br@xmath20 , the latter naturally subtracting off better on these angular scales . we plan to obtain @xmath53band spectra of w42  # 2 and # 3 where the excess emission should be less allowing for an improved picture of the nature of the embedded objects which give rise to the emission spectra seen at @xmath2 .",
    "there are several other stars with similar or slightly lower brightness indicated in figure  [ cmdsub ] , but with apparently normal colors for hot stars .",
    "this suggests a mixture of massive objects with and without circumstellar ( possibly disk ) signatures as seen in m17 @xcite . like m17 ,",
    "the ysos indicate a very young age for the cluster .",
    "the situation in w42 may be compared to other stellar clusters in giant h  ii regions . for m17 ,",
    "@xcite report that the vast majority of cluster stars they studied have infrared excesses .",
    "this result should be confirmed with higher spatial resolution images ; the photometry presented by @xcite was performed by summing the flux in 4.8@xmath13 diameter apertures on their 0.8@xmath13  images .",
    "@xcite note that their data set was analyzed with profile fitting by @xcite who obtain similar results , and @xcite clearly show that at least some of the massive stars in m17 have disk  like spectroscopic features .",
    "@xcite find far fewer stars with excess emission in the orion trapezium cluster and attribute this to a mixture of older and younger stars .",
    "however , @xcite reach a different conclusion regarding the ages of the orion cluster stars , and we will discuss this further in the next section . in w43 ( paper i ) ,",
    "only a handful of objects appear in the excess emission region of the color  color plot and none of the three spectroscopically classified hot stars do .",
    "the brightest object in w43 exhibits wolf ",
    "rayet features in its @xmath3band spectrum suggesting an older age relative to w42 .",
    "this is similar to ngc  3603 , r136 , and the arches ( see the discussion in paper i and references therein ) , and the implication is that while such stars may still be core hydrogen burning , they are not on the zams .",
    "these comparisons need to account for the fact that the extinction is generally greater in w42 and ( much so ) in w43 , so that many objects are not detected at @xmath0 or @xmath1 and hence do not appear in the color  color plot . clearly , high spatial resolution , homogeneous data sets , each analyzed in detail for for completeness at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 would be useful in assessing the intrinsic fractions of stars with excess emission in embedded clusters in giant h  ii regions .    without spectra ,",
    "it is not possible to identify the nature of the remaining objects in the color excess region of figure  [ cc ] , though in the context of this young cluster , it is likely that some are pms stars or protostars .",
    "it is also clear from figure  [ cc ] that some ysos can occupy the same region of color space as normal stars .",
    "some of the cluster stars in figure  [ cc ] near ( @xmath29 , @xmath31 @xmath4 1,2 ) where the dispersion in color is larger might be a combination of wtts with essentially normal stellar colors and ctts / herbig aebe stars with smaller excess emission , the actual nature depending also on the luminosity of any particular object .",
    "alternately , these could be normal main sequence stars .",
    "finally , some could be normal k or m giants in the background , though it is unlikely that many are , given the large number of stars in close association with the central region of the cluster and the fact that we have subtracted a background component from the cmd .",
    "inspection of figures  [ cmd ] and [ cc ] indicates that w42  # 3 has varied in brightness and color between the 1998 and 1999 observations presented here , becoming fainter at @xmath2 and redder .",
    "color and brightness variations in ysos can be explained by a combination of changes in the accretion luminosity produced by the circumstellar disk and changes in the extinction toward the source .",
    "@xcite monitored a sample of ysos for color changes , finding the slopes of the colors ( measured over day to year timescales ) in the @xmath31 vs. @xmath29 color  color diagram were intermediate between the ctts locus ( excess color arising from disk luminosity ) and pure variations along the interstellar reddening lines such as might occur when clumps of obscuring material pass in front of the line of sight to the yso .",
    "@xcite found some yso variations were consistent with one or the other effect dominating .",
    "the color variation for w42  # 3 appears most consistent with a change in the local extinction .",
    "the klf has been used as the basis for mass function determinations in young embedded or obscured massive star clusters .",
    "@xcite found that the m17 cluster klf had a slope consistent with the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) value if the m17 stars were normal main sequence type , but noting that this was difficult to reconcile with their finding that essentially all the m17 cluster stars had infrared excesses . only in the case where such excesses arise in passive disks",
    "could their mass function determination still follow from the klf .",
    "@xcite present a klf for the trapezium cluster in orion ( m42 ) .",
    "they found the slope of the klf to be inconsistent with that for the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , hypothesizing that there are substantial numbers of older stars in m42 as well as very young ones .",
    "however , @xcite found that the klf in m42 was consistent with a population of only very young stars if pms evolutionary tracks were used instead of assuming the cluster stars were on the main sequence .",
    "@xcite show that deuterium burning on the pms can cause peaks in the klf which are a function of age thus producing luminosity functions different from expected if main sequence mass  luminosity relations are assumed .",
    "more recently , the detailed optical imaging / spectroscopic investigation of @xcite exquisitely details the young main sequence and pms stellar population in the orion trapezium cluster , clearly demonstrating the overall youth of the cluster .",
    "@xcite presented a mass function determination for the arches cluster located near the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "they find that the arches cluster may have upwards of 100 o stars and an age of @xmath14 2 myr .",
    "using their observed klf and a mean value for @xmath51 , these authors determined the mass function by relating the @xmath2 magnitudes to stellar mass using the @xcite stellar evolutionary models .",
    "@xcite find a mass function in the arches which is significantly flatter than @xcite .",
    "they attribute this result to the different pre ",
    "conditions for star formation in the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy which they argue should favor higher mass stars .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation elsewhere in the galaxy and in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite find from a combination of spectroscopy and imaging that the imf is similar for ob associations and dense massive star clusters ( most notably r136 in the lmc ) and in agreement with a @xcite imf .",
    "the preceding discussion indicates that care must be taken in transforming the klf into a mass function , including the effects of pms evolution . in this sense",
    ", the determination of a mass function for w42 is premature given the implied young age and lack of transformations between pms models and near infrared colors ( which should include the effects of associated disk emission ) .",
    "however , a comparison to the different klfs is warranted .    in  3.1 we derived the klf for the inner 30@xmath13 central cluster in w42 and showed that it should be complete to 80 @xmath17 for @xmath54 15 mag .",
    "the measured slope of the cumulative counts in the central 30@xmath13 klf ( @xmath54 15 , correcting for incompleteness ) is 0.38 @xmath19 0.016 .",
    "if we consider only stars in the background subtracted cmd ( figure  [ cmdsub ] , the measured slope ( @xmath54 15 ) is 0.36 @xmath19 0.011 .",
    "the slope in our background annulus ( 30@xmath13 to 50@xmath13 , @xmath54 15 , correcting for incompleteness ) is 0.51 @xmath19 0.017 .",
    "these values may be compared to the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for convenience , we compare the power  law slope to the _ cumulative _ klf which @xcite also calculated for their data . in m17 ,",
    "@xcite report a slope of 0.26 , which they claim is consistent with the @xcite imf .",
    "we have calculated approximate slopes for @xcite and @xcite from figures of the published luminosity functions ; these are 0.39 @xmath19 0.016 and 0.28 @xmath19 0.013 , respectively .",
    "@xcite conducted completeness detailed tests and corrected the published counts .",
    "@xcite conducted more rudimentary checks on completeness and report the klf for the magnitude range they believe to be complete . @xcite and @xcite conducted no completeness tests using artificial stars , to the best of our knowledge , though @xcite claim the klf is complete .",
    "all the klfs discussed here are defined for the central clusters in the respective star forming regions , and none have been corrected for reddening .",
    "thus our comparison is only for the slopes of the klfs and does not account for possible differences resulting from differential reddening .",
    "the klf in w42 appears to be more similar to that in orion ( i.e. relatively steep ) than in m17 or the arches .",
    "given the likely presence of ysos as discussed above , we may be seeing the effects of pms evolution on the number counts as is the case for the trapezium .",
    "both the arches and m17 clusters clearly have more massive stars than are present in the central cluster of w42 or the trapezium @xcite .",
    "the apparent klfs in these latter two clusters appear at least superficially similar , though @xcite and @xcite reach rather different conclusions when converting to mass functions .",
    "@xcite derive an imf which is much flatter ( @xmath14 factor of 2 ) than @xcite , while @xcite find a mass function which is possibly consistent with @xcite .",
    "in  3.2 we classified the spectrum of the bright central star , w42  # 1 , as an early to mid o type ( @xmath37 o5o6 ) .",
    "several lines of evidence presented above suggest that the w42 cluster is quite young .",
    "if we take w42  # 1 to be on the zams then its apparent brightness would give a distance to the cluster of 2.2 kpc , considerably closer than the radio distance ( 3.7 kpc , see  3 ) . in ",
    "3.2 , we argued that the spectrum of w42  # 1 was most similar to those for the dwarf or giant luminosity classes .",
    "using the average @xmath55 from @xcite for dwarf stars and colors from  3 , gives 2600@xmath56 kpc .",
    "if the giant star @xmath55 from @xcite is used , then the distance estimate becomes 3400@xmath57 pc .",
    "the uncertainty in the distance estimate is completely dominated by the luminosity class assumed and the scatter in the intrinsic @xmath55 of o stars ( @xmath19 0.67 mag ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the reddening and apparent magnitude are negligible in comparison : a few percent for @xmath58 and 10 @xmath17 for @xmath51 , where the largest part of the uncertainty is in the choice of reddening law ( see mathis 1990 ) .",
    "these distance estimates are in agreement with @xcite who argued that w42 ( g25.4se ) was at the near distance given by the radio recombination line velocity and galactic rotation model .",
    "depending on the true luminosity of w42  # 1 , the cluster may even be somewhat closer .",
    "@xcite estimated the lyc luminosity of w42 to be 8.2@xmath59 assuming the far kinematic distance ( 13.4 kpc ) . adopting the zams distance ( 2.2 kpc ) as indicated by the young nature of the cluster ( stars w42  # 2 and # 3 )",
    "considerably reduces the expected ionizing flux to 2@xmath60 .    in figure",
    "[ cmdsub ] , we have plotted a zero age main sequence ( zams ) derived from the models of @xcite ( z @xmath4 0.02 ) ; see  3.1.3 .",
    "we have placed the zams in figure  [ cmdsub ] at 2200 pc , assuming that the w42  # 1 is on the zams . in this case",
    ", the ( incomplete ) cluster sequence reaches early k type stars . for the trapezium @xcite claim that the klf shows an intrinsic peak well above the sensitivity of their @xmath3band images .",
    "this peak is due to the pms evolution of the lower mass stars and is sensitive to age on the pms . for the close distance to w42",
    "implied if w42  # 1 is on the zams , the similarity found above for the klf of w42 compared to the trapezium then suggests a similar effect on the klf may be at work .",
    "i.e. , the fainter magnitudes may correspond to lower mass pms stars . in the present case",
    ", we are not claiming to see a real turn over in the klf ( as zinnecker et al .",
    "do in orion ) since this occurs where the @xmath3band counts are demonstrably incomplete due to crowding .    for a distance of 2.2 kpc ,",
    "the cluster has a radius of 0.32 pc at 30@xmath13 .",
    "the surface density in the inner 10@xmath13 ( figure  [ surf ] ) is then within a factor of two for that in the trapezium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath14 6500 pc@xmath61 ) not accounting for the substaintial incompleteness in the present case .",
    "w42 is thus quite dense , and this is another indication of its young age @xcite .",
    "the zams clearly demonstrates the lack of any sensitivity to temperature in the hot stars at near infrared wavelengths .",
    "this means that traditional methods of cluster fitting ( in the observational color  magnitude plane ) for age or distance can not be used and only through suitable numbers of infrared spectra ( resulting in   and ) will the cluster properties truly emerge .",
    "the lack of temperature sensitivity in the near infrared colors does , however , lead to accurate estimates of the foreground extinction .",
    "we have presented high spatial resolution @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 images of the massive star cluster at the heart of the giant h  ii region w42 .",
    "our @xmath3band spectra of three of the brightest four stars in the central 30@xmath13 of the cluster indicate a very young population . the brightest star w42  # 1 is classified as ko5o6 based on the system of @xcite .",
    "such stars are typically associated with mk o5o6.5 dwarfs .",
    "# 2 and w42  # 3 show no stellar absorption features .",
    "this fact , combined with their position in the excess emission band of the @xmath31 vs. @xmath29 color  color plot , leads us to classify them as ysos .",
    "the klf was computed and compared to other massive star clusters .",
    "the klf in w42 appears more similar to that of the trapezium than to the more massive clusters in m17 and the arches .",
    "the steepness of the klf in the trapezium has been attributed to the pms stars present there , and it is possible that a similar effect is present in w42 given our spectroscopic and imaging evidence for ysos .",
    "our spectrum of w42  # 1 confirms the results of @xcite that w42 ( g25.4se ) can not be at the far kinematic distance .",
    "earlier estimates of the lyc output from this giant h  ii region must therefore be revised downward ( by @xmath14 an order of magnitude ) .",
    "if w42  # 1 is on the zams , as we argue based on the presence of young stellar objects , then the cluster is even closer than the near kinematic distance ( 3.7 kpc ) .",
    "we estimate 2.2 kpc . in this case , w42 should not be considered a giant h  ii region as defined in  1 .",
    "our spectrum of w42  # 1 is not sensitive to luminosity class , though it suggests a dwarf or giant classification .",
