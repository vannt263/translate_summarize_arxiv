    "the denomination `` quantum solid '' refers to crystals displaying marked quantum - mechanical effects @xcite .",
    "these include a kinetic energy per particle significantly above its classical value 3@xmath2/2 @xcite , as well as considerably more pronounced particle excursions away from their equilibrium ( lattice ) positions than observed in most solids .",
    "the latter assertion can be phrased quantitativey in terms of the so - called lindemann ratio @xcite @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the root - mean - square displacement of particles away from lattice sites , and @xmath5 the distance between nearest - neighboring sites .",
    "this ratio increases with temperature , and in most substances takes on a value close to 0.1 at melting ; however , in a highly quantal solid such as @xmath1he it can be as high as @xmath6 , even at temperature @xmath2=0 , as a result of the large zero - point motion resulting from the light mass of the atoms .",
    "indeed , for a long time the most commonly accepted explanation for the failure of he to solidify at low temperature , under the presure of its own vapour , has been that the large zero - point motion of its light atoms acts to destabilize the crystal phase ( this belief has been recently challenged @xcite ) . an interesting theoretical question remains that of the role played by quantum mechanics in the melting of solids made of light atoms or molecules .",
    "+ helium is , of course , the archetypal quantum solid @xcite but sizable quantum effects have also been predicted and observed for solid parahydrogen ( _ p_-h@xmath7 ) .",
    "although its constituent particles are molecules of mass one half of that of a @xmath1he atom , _",
    "p_-h@xmath7 is nonetheless a stronger crystal than helium at comparable thermodynamic conditions , owing to the depth of the attractive well of the intermolecular potential , roughly three times that between two helium atoms .",
    "for this reason , unlike helium parahydrogen is a crystal at @xmath2=0 ( even in reduced dimensions @xcite ) , and in many respects the behaviour of solid _ p_-h@xmath7 interpolates between that of a classical crystal and solid helium .",
    "it has been recently suggested , however , that the melting of a crystal of 2 may be driven primarily by quantum - mechanical effects @xcite . + both the mean kinetic energy per particle , as well as the mean square displacement @xmath8 around lattice sites ,",
    "can be accessed experimentally by either x - ray or neutron scattering @xcite ; in particular , estimates of @xmath9 can be obtained through the measurement of the debye - waller factor @xcite . on the theoretical front",
    ", first principle @xcite calculations of both quantities can be carried out by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations ; thus , a comparison of theoretical results with experimental data represents a cogent test of the current theoretical understanding of the physics of the simplest quantum crystals , as well as of the most commonly adopted microscopic models thereof .",
    "+ the most important theoretical assumptions built into the vast majority of qmc calculations are _ a _ ) the adoption of a pair potential to describe the interaction of atoms or molecules _ b _ ) the neglect of quantum - mechanical exchanges of indistinguishable particles .",
    "the use of pair potentials has been shown to afford a rather accurate theoretical description of energetic and structural properties of solid he @xcite ( even though the inclusion of three - body terms improves significantly the agreement with the experimental equation of state @xcite ) , as well as 2 @xcite .",
    "exchanges of indistinguishable particles are almost invariably neglected in most theoretical calculations of crystal properties , the main justification being the infrequency with which such exchanges occur @xcite , even in a highly quantal crystal like @xmath1he .",
    "+ it has been suggested , however , that quantum - mechanical exchanges may play a _",
    "major _ role in the stabilization of the bcc phase of solid @xmath0he .",
    "a significant test of this hypothesis would consist of a comparison of computed and measured values of @xmath9 in this system , as one of the most important consequences of quantum - mechanical exchanges is a much greater atomic mobility , resulting in more pronounced fluctuations around lattice sites than if exchanges were absent @xcite .",
    "+ a detailed comparison of experimental and theoretical results for @xmath9 has been carried out for fcc and hcp @xmath0he and @xmath1he , at temperatures between 5 k and 35 k , yielding satisfactory agreement @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no microscopic calculations have been performed for the bcc phase of the two isotopes , which occurs at considerably lower temperatures and coexists with fluid phases whose physics is dominated by quantum exchanges . on the experimental side , we are only aware of measurements of the lindemann ratio in bcc @xmath1he .",
    "+ in this paper we report results of qmc calculations of the mean square atomic excursions away from lattice positions in bcc @xmath1he and @xmath0he at the melting temperatures @xmath2=1.6 k ( @xmath1he ) and 0.65 k ( @xmath0he ) .",
    "we also computed the same quantity for the equilibrium hcp phase of 2 from a low temperature @xmath2=1 k , all the way to the melting temperature @xmath2=13.8 k. in all of our calculations pair potentials are used and quantum - mechanical exchanges neglected .",
    "we compute separately thermal and quantum - mechanical contributions to atomic and molecular displacements .",
    "+ computed values of @xmath9 are found to be in excellent agreement with experiment for bcc @xmath1he ; for bcc @xmath0he our estimated value of the lindemann ratio @xmath10 is @xmath11 6.5% lower than existing theoretical estimates . in principle , there is no reason not to expect comparable accuracy for both isotopes . however , if particle exchanges are as prominent in this phase as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible that one may see a difference between the experimentally measured value and one predicted by a calculation neglecting atomic exchanges , as these are likely to result in a significant enhancement of the mobility of atoms in the crystal at melting . + the results for @xmath9 in hcp 2 show a clear dependence on temperature , of a magnitude that appears to be experimentally observable ; this is in qualitative and quantitative disagreement with recent measurements .",
    "we find that , while atomic excursions away from lattice sites in bcc he are largely quantum - mechanical in character , in 2 at melting thermal and quantum - mechanical contributions are very nearly equal in magnitude .",
    "thus , according to this criterion solid 2 may be regarded as neither completely `` quantum '' nor `` classical '' , but rather as a system sitting on the dividing line between the two physical behaviours .",
    "+ we also report in this paper our estimates for the pressure and/or the mean kinetic energy per particle , and compare them with available experimental determinations .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the microscopic model and offer details of the calculation carried out in this work ; in sec .",
    "[ res ] we illustrate our results , outlining our conclusion in sec . [ conclusions ] .",
    "consistently with most theoretical studies , our systems of interest , namely solid helium and parahydrogen , are modeled as ensembles of @xmath12 point - like particles of spin zero , enclosed in a parallelepipedal cell of volume @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the quantum - mechanical many - body hamiltonian is the following : @xmath14 here , @xmath15=6.0596",
    "k@xmath16 for @xmath1he , 8.0417 k@xmath16 for @xmath0he and 12.031 k@xmath16 for 2 , while @xmath17 is the potential describing the interaction between two particles , atoms or molecules , assumed here to depend only on their relative distance .",
    "the results presented here for the helium isotopes were obtained using the aziz pair potential @xcite , whereas the silvera - goldman potential @xcite was used for 2 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these are not the only potentials that have been used in previous simulation work , but it seems fair to state that they are the most commonly adopted . they have both been shown to afford rather accurate quantitative descriptions of the thermodynamics of the solid phase of helium and 2 .",
    "naturally , in principle a more accurate model would go beyond the simple pair decomposition , including , for instance , interactions among triplets ; however , published numerical work ( e.g. , on helium ) has given strong indications that three - body corrections , while significantly affecting the estimation of the pressure , have a relatively small effect on the structure and dynamics of the system , of interest here @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system , as modeled by the many - body hamiltonian ( [ one ] ) , were studied by means of numerical simulations , based on the continuous - space worm algorithm ( wa ) @xcite .",
    "this is a fairly well - established ( monte carlo ) methodology , based on r. p. feynman s path integral formulation of quantum statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "it allows one to obtain essentially exact numerical estimates of thermodynamic properties of quantum many - body systems at finite temperature , directly from the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "the reader is referred to ref . for a thorough description of the technique .",
    "the specific implementation utilized in this project is _ canonical _ ,",
    "i.e. , we keep the number @xmath12 of particles fixed @xcite .",
    "other technical aspects of the calculations are common to any other qmc simulation scheme .",
    "the usual fourth - order high - temperature propagator was adopted here @xcite ; convergence of the estimates was observed for a time step @xmath18 k@xmath19 , for both he and 2 .",
    "because the computational cost was negligible , all estimates reported here were obtained using twice as small a time step , in order to be on the safe side .",
    "+ as mentioned above , the sampling of quantum - mechanical exchanges of identical particle , in principle allowed by the methodology utilized here , is explicitly excluded , i.e. , we treat particles as _",
    "distinguishable_. this is an excellent assumption for 2 in the temperature range explored here , whereas for he at the temperature of interest exchanges do occur , albeit rarely .",
    "the exclusion of exchanges is deliberate , as we are interested in assessing their possible importance through a comparison with experimental measurements ; however , it ought to be reminded that inclusion of exchanges in a fermi system like @xmath0he would be rendered much more complicated by the appearance of the well - known  sign \" problem , plaguing any current qmc methodology . in the absence of exchanges ,",
    "the wa is very similar to conventional path integral monte carlo @xcite , although the presence of an open world line ( path ) in the wa allows for direct computation of the one - body density matrix @xcite , for which however we do not report results here .",
    "+ the calculations of the kinetic energy per particle and of the pressure , as well as of structural quantities such as the pair correlation function , are standard @xcite ; on the other hand , that of @xmath9 has been performed relatively infrequently so far , and for this reason we offer here a few relevant details , with the general remark that we largely duplicate the procedure illustrated in ref . .",
    "+ the mean square displacement of a particle away from a lattice site @xmath9 in a crystal at temperature @xmath2 is defined as [ usq ] u^2=  _ i=1^n _ 0 ^ 1/t du  ( * r*_i(u)-*b*_i ) ^2where the sum runs over all the atoms or molecules in the system , @xmath20 is a set of fixed lattice positions consistent with the crystal structure of interest , @xmath21 stands for quantum - mechanical thermal average and the integral is over the imaginary - time path @xmath22 of the @xmath23th particle @xcite .",
    "it is possible to identify two separate contributions to @xmath9 in ( [ usq ] ) , namely @xcite [ break ] u^2= u^2_q+u^2_t where [ qq ] u^2_q =  _ i=1^n _ 0 ^ 1/t du  ( * r*_i(u)-*|r*_i ) ^2and [ tt ] u^2_t =  _ i=1^n ( * b*_i-*|r*_i ) ^2having defined the single particle path centroid as _",
    "i = t  _ 0 ^",
    "1/t du  * r*_i(u ) the usefulness of this breakdown lies in the fact that @xmath9 is dominated by either @xmath24 or @xmath25 in different temperature limits .",
    "specifically , at high temperature ( i.e. , in the classical limit ) @xmath24 becomes negligible and @xmath26 , as the imaginary - time path of a quantum particle shrinks to a point . on the other hand , in the @xmath27 limit",
    "it is @xmath28 , as particle excursions away from lattice sites are mostly quantum - mechanical in nature ( i.e. , zero - point motion ) .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ break ] ) can be used to assess quantitatively the relative importance of quantum - mechanical versus classical ( i.e. , thermal ) contributions to atomic / molecular displacements at a given @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we shall make use of the ratio @xmath29 , which tends to zero at high @xmath2 and approaches unity as @xmath27 .",
    "+ implicit in the definitions ( [ usq ] ) and ( [ tt ] ) is the assumption that at each imaginary time along the paths , every particle remain close to one and the same lattice position . in a typical simulation , particles",
    "are initially placed at lattice sites @xmath30 , @xmath31 through @xmath12 , but obviously wander away in the course of a run ; for the systems and thermodynamic conditions considered in this study , we observed that particles for the most part remain close to their initial lattice sites @xcite . at low temperature , however , especially for the lighter he isotope , single - particle paths can become sufficiently extended in space that at different imaginary times a particle may be close to _ different _ lattice sites , even in the absence of quantum - mechanical exchanges . in order to avoid complications",
    ", we discarded the contribution to the accumulated statistical average of @xmath25 of such",
    "( very rare ) single - particle paths . because the fraction of single - particle paths discarded has never exceeded @xmath32 in any of our simulations , we believe this not to result in a significant bias of our estimates . it may be noted that it is roughly equivalent to the procedure implemented in ref . , consisting of rejecting sampling moves that take any particle further away from its assigned lattice site than a pre - definedtether \" distance , typically of the order of the lattice constant .",

    "+ the calculation carried out in this work fails to support such a claim ; specifically , although there are undoubtedly significant , measurable quantum effects in a crystal of 2 , even at the melting temperature ( just as there are in the liquid phase at freezing @xcite ) , as indicated by the relatively high value of the lindemann ratio , nonetheless thermal effects are significant at high @xmath2 . indeed , the parameter @xmath47 , which is a measure of the relative importance of quantum effects , takes on in 2 a value close to 0.5 at melting , as opposed to , for example , 0.75 of @xmath1he ( a similar value in 2 is observed at @xmath60 k , i.e. , one half of the melting temperature ) .",
    "+ the temperature dependence of the mean square molecular displacements observed in our simulations of a 2 crystal , is of a magnitude that should lend itself to unambiguous experimental detection .",
    "thus , we have no explanation for the qualitative and quantitative disagreement between our theoretical results and the experimental measurements of ref . at low temperature ( @xmath61 k ) .",
    "in this work , we carried out extensive qmc simulations of the bcc solid phase of the two isotopes of helium , as well as of the hcp phase of 2 at low temperature , based on a microscopic model only including pair - wise interactions . in all of the calculations , we regarded particles as _ distinguishable _ ,",
    "i.e. , quantum statistics was ignored .",
    "the microscopic model affords generally satisfactory to excellent agreement with measured thermodynamic properties ( e.g. , the pressure ) .",
    "+ we computed for all the systems considered the mean square displacement of particles away from lattice sites , and obtained estimates in excellent agreement with experiment for bcc @xmath1he ; the estimate obtained for the lindemann ratio in bcc @xmath0he is about 6.5% below existing theoretical predictions .",
    "this new result should supersede those predictions , since it is based on a more robust methodology and accurate pair potential .",
    "+ the microscopic hamiltonian utiized is the same for both isotopes , and is expected to afford comparable accuracy ; it was suggested in ref .",
    ", however , that quantum exchanges significantly enhance atomic mobility in a @xmath0he crystal , and thus must be explicitly included in a calculation , if accurate agreement with experiment is sought .",
    "this would point to a remarkable difference between the roles of fermi and bose statistics _ vis -  - vis _ crystallization ; for , while the latter enhances the stability of the ( superfluid ) liquid phase @xcite , the former promotes the formation of a crystal in which particles enjoy much greater mobility than the neglect of statistics would lead one to expect .",
    "we did not attempt to perform any simulation explicitly including fermi statistics in this work , due to the presence of the above - mentioned  sign \" problem .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ obvious that such a calculation would be unfeasible , as exchanges are likely to be still relatively infrequent , and therefore the signal - to - noise ratio may remain high enough to allow one to collect sufficient statistics with reasonable computational effort .",
    "we postpone this project until the future .",
    "+ in general , we found that the physics of these two crystal at melting is largely dominated by quantum mechanics ( zero - point motion ) .",
    "indeed , we observed this to remain the case even in the hcp phase of @xmath1he at higher pressure .",
    "for example , simulation of hcp @xmath1he at a pressure of approximately 40 bars ( density @xmath62 @xmath35 ) , at the melting temperature @xmath2=2.5 k ( using a number of particles @xmath12=512 ) yields a value of the parameter @xmath47 defined above close to 0.7 , i.e. , most of the contribution to atomic displacements comes from quantum mechanics . on further pressurizing the hcp crystal , the value of @xmath47 at melting reduces progressively , i.e. , the behaviour of the system approaches that of a classical solid ; however , effects of quantum mechanics remain significant even at a relatively high pressure .",
    "for example , close to 2.4 kbars at the melting temperature @xmath2=24 k ( @xmath63 @xmath35 ) , @xmath47 is found to be @xmath11 0.4 . + our calculated molecular displacements in solid 2 display a clear dependence on temperature , in disagreement with recent experimental measurements .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is unknown at this time .",
    "it is found that , although quantum mechanical effect are important , the behaviour of this system near melting shows both quantum and classical aspects , both roughly equally important in magnitude .",
