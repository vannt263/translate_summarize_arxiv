    "quantum parameter estimation , originally motivated by optical metrology  @xcite , considers how to estimate parameters associated with the evolution of quantum systems by physical means .",
    "a theory of quantum estimation , derived from the laws of quantum physics and statistics , has been developed and applied to various evolution processes yielding important results for various metrology situations  @xcite .",
    "we consider the single qubit depolarizing channel , which maps a qubit , initially in the state @xmath0 , via @xmath1 } \\ ; \\hat{i } + \\lambda { \\hat{\\rho}}\\label{eq : depol}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 the aim of a physical estimation protocol would be to determine @xmath3 as accurately as possible by subjecting a collection of qubits to this evolution .",
    "the depolarizing channel is interesting for various reasons .",
    "first , depolarization is a standard model of certain noise processes and is of general interest for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "specific examples appear in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite and optical quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "second , quantum parameter estimation reveals fundamental and quantifiable differences with classical approaches when manifestly quantum resources such as entanglement are used .",
    "for example , in the estimation of the phase associated with a unitary parameter , classical approaches yield an uncertainty that scales as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of times the channel is invoked , whereas using entangled states can result in a lower uncertainty that scales as @xmath6 , thus pointing to a measurable gain provided by entanglement  @xcite .",
    "depolarizing channel parameter estimation has been investigated previously in the context of finding optimal estimation protocols  @xcite where any possible initial state is assumed to be available .",
    "it emerges that the optimal estimation protocol requires qubit pairs , each initially in an entangled pure state , and that states displaying entanglement or correlations amongst more than two qubits will not give any advantages to estimation accuracy  @xcite .",
    "we consider various estimation protocols for the constrained situation where _ when the available initial state of each qubit is mixed .",
    "_ this situation arises in room temperature solution state nmr , where the initial state for any nuclear spin is highly mixed  @xcite .",
    "we ask whether , for mixed initial state situations , protocols involving correlated states can yield gains in estimation accuracy compared to protocols that use product states and whether increasing the number of correlated qubits beyond two is advantageous .",
    "while we will consider these questions for situations involving initial states with all possible ranges of mixedness , we will focus on the special case where the initial state of each qubit is highly mixed .",
    "our approach is motivated by similar work for other types of channels where gains were found when using correlated states  @xcite and is also inspired by various other approaches to investigating parameter estimation with mixed initial states  @xcite .    this article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : genestimation ] offers a review of quantum estimation theory .",
    "section  [ sec : indest ] applies this to the simplest depolarizing channel parameter channel estimation protocol , establishes a benchmark against which other schemes are to be compared and reviews existing results for parameter estimation using pure initial states .",

    "physical parameter estimation requires that suitably prepared quantum systems be subjected to the operation @xmath7 which is dependent on a real parameter @xmath3 that is to be estimated . the generic scheme for doing this , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] , assumes that @xmath8 copies of the operation , or channel , are available .",
    "these may be invoked on one or more of @xmath5 systems with invocations surrounded by a series of parameter independent unitary transformations .",
    "quantum systems , each represented by a horizontal line .",
    "this procedure uses @xmath8 invocations of the operation @xmath7 and parameter - independent unitary transformations @xmath9 the initial state of each quantum system is @xmath10 and the pre - measurement state of the collection of systems is @xmath11 measurements on individual systems follow @xmath12 [ fig : generalscheme ] ]    each quantum system is prepared in a known initial state @xmath10 .",
    "after the final unitary , a measurement is chosen and performed on each system and the measurement outcomes are recorded .",
    "the final pre - measurement state @xmath13 may depend on the parameter and thus so will the probabilities with which the measurement outcomes occur .",
    "thus information about @xmath3 might be inferred from the measurement outcomes by classical data processing , thus yielding an estimate for the parameter .",
    "the fact that measurement outcomes in quantum physics are usually statistically distributed implies that different runs of the same estimation procedure will yield estimates that fluctuate about a mean value .",
    "the aim of quantum parameter estimation is to tailor the process by choosing the initial state @xmath10 , the parameter independent unitaries @xmath14 and the final measurements so that the estimates will display minimal fluctuations about the actual parameter value .",
    "the accuracy of the estimation is quantified via these statistical fluctuations as follows .",
    "given a set of measurement outcomes , one on each qubit and denoted @xmath15 , an estimate for the parameter @xmath16 is attained via @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an estimator function .",
    "fluctuations in these measurement outcomes from one run of the estimation procedure to another generate fluctuations in @xmath16 .",
    "the extent to which this occurs depends on the construction of the estimator function .",
    "key requirements for an estimation protocol will be that the estimator is unbiased , i.e. @xmath19 , and that it minimizes the variance , @xmath20 where the angle brackets indicate the mean over all possible measurement outcomes . the variance will depend on the choice of estimator .",
    "however , a key result  @xcite is that _ the variance on any estimator is bounded from below via the cramr - rao bound _",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 ^ 2\\ ;                   \\ ;                   \\mathrm{d}x_1 \\ldots \\mathrm{d}x_n .",

    "this is independent of the choice of estimator .",
    "quite generally , there is always an estimator  @xcite , which asymptotically saturates the bound of eq .  .",
    "thus in classical parameter estimation the fisher information quantifies the accuracy of any possible estimate ; the larger @xmath24 , the better the estimate .    in classical estimation , it is easily shown  @xcite that if the same estimation trial is repeated @xmath8 times independently , the the fisher information becomes @xmath25 where @xmath24 is the fisher information for a single trial .",
    "thus the cramr - rao bound implies a reduction in the variance by a factor of @xmath8 , yielding the typical classical reduction in uncertainty of the estimate by a factor of @xmath26    in quantum evolution processes the probability distribution for the measurement outcomes depends on the type of measurement .",
    "thus , given many possible choices of measurement , there will be many possible values for the classical fisher information for the same evolution process .",
    "quantum estimation aims for a measurement which results in the largest classical fisher information .",
    "this is constrained and simplified by the _",
    "quantum cramr - rao bound , _ which states that , for any measurement the resulting classical fisher information satisfies @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the quantum fisher information and is _ independent of the choice of measurement _  @xcite .",

    "specifically , if @xmath32 then  @xcite @xmath33 quite generally , there exists a measurement procedure which asymptotically attains the quantum cramr - rao bound  @xcite .",
    "thus the quantum fisher information quantifies the accuracy of the quantum estimation process .",
    "the main task in quantum parameter estimation is to provide a protocol giving a final pre - measurement state @xmath13 with the maximum quantum fisher information ; this approach has been widely adopted elsewhere  @xcite .    before continuing",

    "is  @xcite @xmath34}.              \\label{eq : quantumfishertwo}\\ ] ] the quantum fisher information will depend on the resources , such as the numbers of qubits , channel invocations , single qubit unitaries or entangling unitaries that are used and various competing estimation protocols can only be compared in terms of their resource use . in this article",
    "we take a common approach , which regards the number of channel invocations @xmath8 in the circuit of fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] as the only important resource cost  @xcite . in this context , the goal of any quantum estimation protocol is to produce a final state with the maximum quantum fisher information per channel invocation .",
    "the initial state for the entire system can be assumed to be a product of states for the individual systems . if necessary , any of @xmath14 can be used to generate entangled or otherwise correlated states as the procedure unfolds .",
    "we can then consider two broad classes of estimation schemes .",
    "in the first the unitaries @xmath14 never produce any correlation between the individual systems and the entire system evolves through a series of product states .",
    "various classical approaches to estimation , including repetition and averaging , fall into this realm . in the second ,",
    "some of the unitaries @xmath14 produce states where there is some form of quantum correlation , such as entanglement , between the individual systems .",
    "frequently quantum estimation aims to show that using such correlated states results in a parameter estimate with a greater quantum fisher information per channel invocation  @xcite than is possible with non - correlated states ; indirectly this indicates the utility of quantum resources for information processing .      within the framework of fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] , the typical task is to find the initial state @xmath10 and the unitaries @xmath14 that produce a final state @xmath13 that yields the maximum quantum fisher information per channel invocation .",
    "the convexity of the quantum fisher information guarantees that this will be attained by using a pure initial state  @xcite , and most investigations of depolarizing channel parameter estimation have considered this case  @xcite .",
    "however , it may be that case that the available initial states are not pure .",
    "our aim is to consider various estimation protocols when the available initial states are limited to those that are mixed .",
    "the general initial state of a single qubit is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the components of a three dimensional real vector , @xmath38 .",
    "the magnitude of this vector @xmath39 is called the _ polarization or purity _ of the state and it satisfies @xmath40 when @xmath41 the state is pure and as @xmath42 , which we use to quantify the mixedness or purity of the state , decreases the state becomes more mixed .",
    "thus the principal issue of such mixed state quantum estimation is : _ given that the available qubits have initial states each with polarization @xmath42 , how do the accuracies , quantified by the quantum fisher information , of various parameter estimation protocols compare ? _ note that , in this approach , the orientation of the polarization vector @xmath38 is irrelevant , as this can be modified at no cost with a single qubit unitary without changing the polarization @xmath42 .",
    "the simplest parameter estimation scheme , which also forms the baseline against which all other schemes may be compared , is that where the channel is invoked once on a single qubit and is described in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqsc ] . this will be termed the single qubit , single channel ( sqsc ) protocol .    .",
    "a parameter independent unitary transformation @xmath43 precedes the single channel invocation , producing a channel input state , @xmath44 .",
    "a measurement follows the channel invocation .",
    "[ fig : sqsc ] ]    the unitary @xmath43 of fig .",
    "[ fig : sqsc ] only changes the orientation of @xmath38 , leaving the polarization unaltered and thus can be omitted .",
    "then eq .",
    "yields that the state after one channel invocation is @xmath45 .",
    "the quantum fisher information can be computed by first determining the sld using prop .  1 of  @xcite and then substituting into eq .  .",

    "_ the sld is @xmath55 substituting into eq .",
    "then gives that _ the quantum fisher information for the sqsc protocol using an initial state with polarization @xmath42 _ is @xmath56 this is the baseline quantum fisher information against which all other estimation schemes are to be compared .",
    "we briefly digress to discuss the previously investigated  @xcite extreme case , where the initial states are pure . if it were possible to modify the initial state polarization , then eq .",
    ", shows that , in accordance with general results  @xcite , the largest quantum fisher information would be attained for a pure input state , i.e.  when @xmath57 giving @xmath58 usually the key issue of interest in quantum parameter estimation is whether a greater quantum fisher information can be attained when entangled multiple qubits are available as input for the channel . for the depolarizing channel",
    "it has been shown that entanglement can yield a greater quantum fisher information .",
    "specifically if the channel is applied to one of two qubits then the optimal quantum fisher information is attained  @xcite when the two qubits are prepared in a maximally entangled pure state , such as @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting quantum fisher information is @xmath60 it is straightforward to show that @xmath61 whenever @xmath62    the remaining question is whether any additional qubits and channel invocations can yield a greater quantum fisher information per channel invocation .",
    "remarkably the result is  @xcite that the optimal depolarizing channel parameter estimation scheme uses pairs of qubits , each in a maximally entangled pure input state .",
    "the channel is applied once to only one of each entangled pair and the resulting quantum fisher information per channel use is that of eq .  .",
    "thus _ when qubits are available in pure initial states then entangling more than two qubits can not yield any advantages for depolarizing channel parameter estimation .",
    "_ however , we stress that this does not necessarily pertain to the situation that we address , in which the available input states are not pure .",
    "the previous discussion motivates the central questions of our work : _ given a collection of qubits , each initially in a state with the same polarization @xmath42 , is it possible to enhance the parameter estimation accuracy by using multiple channel invocations or entanglement or correlations amongst more than two qubits ?",
    "if so to what extent can the accuracy , as measured by the quantum fisher information per channel use , be enhanced ? _",
    "a first strategy for enhancing estimation accuracy is one where the same process is repeated independently , as is done for classical repeat and average schemes .",
    "specifically we consider the protocol of fig .",
    "[ fig : indchanneluse ] , called the _ independent channel use protocol . _ here there are @xmath8 qubits , each in the initial state @xmath10 and subject to a parameter independent single qubit preparatory unitary .",
    "the channel is subsequently invoked exactly once on each qubit . in this protocol",
    "there are never any correlations between the qubits during the entire process ; in this sense it resembles a classical approach .",
    "single qubits , each initially in the state @xmath10 .",
    "qubit @xmath63 is subjected to a single qubit unitary , @xmath64 , which is independent of the channel parameter , producing the input state @xmath65 thereafter a depolarizing channel is applied once to each qubit .",
    "[ fig : indchanneluse ] ]    the quantum fisher information is additive in such cases  @xcite and thus the quantum fisher information for the independent channel use protocol with @xmath8 channel invocations is @xmath66 although this is an improvement over the sqsc protocol , clearly the quantum fisher information _ per channel use _ in the independent channel use protocol is identical to that of the sqsc protocol .",
    "thus _ the independent channel use protocol attains the same estimation accuracy , measured in terms of quantum fisher information per channel invocation , as the sqsc protocol . _    a second strategy , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : seqchanneluse ] , is that where _ only one qubit is available and the channel is invoked sequentially a total of @xmath8 times . _",
    "successive channel invocations are interspersed with parameter - independent unitaries .",
    "is subjected to @xmath8 channel invocations .",
    "each channel invocation is preceded a single qubit unitary , @xmath67 , all of which are independent of the channel parameter .",
    "[ fig : seqchanneluse ] ]    assuming the standard initial state , @xmath10 , the effect of @xmath43 is to rotate the polarization vector , @xmath68 without altering its magnitude .",
    ".   implies that the state after the first channel invocation is @xmath69 . using the same argument , the state after the second channel invocation is @xmath70 where @xmath71 rotates @xmath72 continuing , the state prior to measurement is @xmath73 where @xmath74 a calculation similar to that giving eq",
    ".   yields that the quantum fisher information for @xmath8 sequential channel invocations on a single qubit is @xmath75 thus the quantum fisher information per channel invocation is @xmath76 to compare this to the sqsc protocol we define the _ sequential channel use gain _ as @xmath77 figure  [ fig : gainseqplot ] illustrates the typical gain , plotted here for the @xmath78 case .",
    "this shows that the sequential channel use protocol is advantageous for certain ranges of parameter values and polarizations but disadvantageous for others .    .",
    "[ fig : gainseqplot ] ]    the sequential channel use gain decreases monotonically with @xmath42 and increases monotonically with @xmath3 ( these are proved in appendix  [ app : gainseq ] ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this separates the pure initial state case , i.e.  @xmath41 , from mixed initial state cases , i.e.  @xmath79 . for the _ pure initial state case ,",
    "_ it is shown in appendix  [ app : gainseq ] that @xmath80 for the _ mixed initial state case , _ it is also shown appendix  [ app : gainseq ] that @xmath81 in both cases the upper bound is attained when @xmath82    it follows that _ if the available initial state is pure there is no advantage to the sequential channel use protocol .",
    "if the available initial state is mixed then , for certain initial polarizations and the parameter values , there can be an advantage to the sequential channel use protocol .",
    "_    it remains to assess whether for mixed initial states , there is any advantage to increasing the number of channel invocations .",
    "to do so , we compare the quantum fisher information per channel use of eq .   for @xmath83 channel invocations versus that for @xmath8 channel invocations .",
    "an advantage is attained when the ratio of that for @xmath83 to that for @xmath8 exceeds @xmath84 , and straightforward algebra shows that this is equivalent to @xmath85/\\lambda^{2m+2}$ ] .",
    "the right hand side of this increases monotonically with @xmath3 and attains a maximum of @xmath84 when @xmath86 .",
    "also it is negative when @xmath87 , implying that when @xmath87 there is no polarization for which an additional channel use will give an advantage .",
    "thus for any polarization there will be some parameter values for which additional invocations in the sequential channel use protocol will be advantageous .",
    "however , the range of possible parameter values for which this occurs , bounded from below by at least @xmath88 , shrinks with increasing channel invocations .",
    "an additional resource available to multiple qubit systems , is the existence of states in which there are correlations between the individual qubits and we now consider whether these can enhance the accuracy of parameter estimation for the depolarizing channel .",
    "we consider the particular correlated state protocol procedure of fig .",
    "[ fig : preparedscheme ] ; this was previously investigated for other channels  @xcite .",

    "we have considered estimation of the depolarizing channel parameter for various situations where the available initial state of each qubit is mixed and we quantified the accuracy of each in terms of the quantum fisher information after channel invocation .",
    "we showed that for certain ranges of initial state polarization and channel parameter , a protocol that uses correlated states prior to channel invocation attains a larger quantum fisher information per channel invocation than either a protocol which uses product states throughout or another protocol which uses a sequence of channel invocations on a single qubit .",

    "we were only able to prove this for the depolarizing channel in the limit as the initial polarization approaches zero , but we were also unable to generate a counterexample .",
    "this was not central to our results but it does merit further investigation .",
    "the source of the gain can not always be attributed to the presence of entangled or non - separable states prior to channel invocation ; we demonstrated this for the two qubit example .",
