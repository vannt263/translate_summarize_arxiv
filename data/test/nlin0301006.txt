    "the modern approach to the study of a dynamical system identifies solving the problem with finding the global structure of phase space . on the other hand ,",
    "bifurcation theory has mostly concentrated on _ local behavior in the parameter space _ ( so even when global phase space bifurcations are considered , they are always considered in a small neighborhood of a given parameter value ) . here",
    "we suggest that global analysis with respect to parameters leads to understanding of the phase space structure in parameter regimes which are unreachable by the currently known analysis techniques .",
    "in particular , we examine some features of the global dependence of periodically forced systems with finite forcing amplitude on the forcing frequency .    the study of the effect of periodic forcing on homoclinic loops has been thoroughly investigated since the times of poincar .",
    "analytical understanding of such systems has been attained in three possible limits ( see @xcite,@xcite ) : the fast and slow oscillations limits and the small forcing limit ( see figure [ fig : spanfam ] ) . for fast oscillations averaging methods apply , and together with kam theory , these are used to obtain upper bounds on the separatrix splitting .",
    "these bounds are exponentially small in the frequency ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "lower bounds on the separatrix splitting involve delicate analysis which has been proved , under some structural assumptions on the flow , only in recent years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the slow oscillations regime corresponds to the region where adiabatic theory applies .",
    "two approaches have been applied to this limit - the first one corresponds to extending classical adiabatic theory to separatrix crossing ( @xcite,@xcite ) and the other corresponds to examining the geometrical properties of stable and unstable manifolds to hyperbolic manifolds with slowly varying motion on them ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "most of the analytical studies have been performed in the small oscillations regime in which perturbation methods apply ( see ( @xcite ) and references therein ) . the most important ingredient from these studies to the current paper",
    "is the existence of a flux mechanism via lobes ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "here we show that for a large class of systems , the phase space structure and its associated transport properties have some common non - monotone dependence on the frequency of the forcing term .",
    "namely , we establish that in some cases , even for finite size oscillations , there exists a function which depends on the frequency continuously . after some natural scaling ,",
    "this function is simply the sum of the areas of the incoming lobes per period , normalized by the forcing period .",
    "hence , results obtained in the fast and slow limits supply information regarding the behavior in the intermediate regime where no analytical methods apply ( see figure [ fig : spanfam ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this proposed viewpoint leads to a non - traditional scaling of the flow which is relevant for studying its behavior near homoclinic tangles .",
    "this paper supplies mathematical formulation and generalization of the common work of the author with a. poje @xcite , in which similar issues were considered in the context of fluid mixing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section we define the class of forced hamiltonian families which we consider .",
    "roughly , these are forced hamiltonian families with split separatrices , for which the splitting exists for all positive parameter values and as the family parameter varies the scaled frequency includes the semi - infinite line . in the second section",
    "we construct a labelling scheme for primary homoclinic orbits , which relies on the concepts of unstable ordering introduced by easton @xcite .",
    "this labelling scheme is valid for all parameter values and behaves well across homoclinic bifurcations . in the third section",
    "we prove the main result of this paper - that the flux through the homoclinic loop depends continuously ( in fact it is @xmath3 ) in the spanning parameter of the family ( in @xcite we considered a restricted class of systems for which the continuity of the flux followed immediately ) .",
    "to prove this result several properties of the lobes are studied , the details are included in appendix 2 . in the fourth section",
    "we recall the proof of rk and poje , showing that the flux is non - monotone in the scaled frequency and recall the implications of these results , especially in view of their implications regarding the stochastic zone width ( see @xcite ) .",
    "section five includes a demonstration of these concepts for the forced center - saddle bifurcation problem .",
    "conclusions are followed by two appendices - in the first the homoclinic scaling is discussed whereas in the second detailed proofs of some properties of the lobes are included , the relation between the flux and the areas of the exit and entry sets is explained , and the adiabatic limit is discussed .",

    "* in the near - integrable case the scaling functions may be simply extracted from the integrable flow , see for example section [ sec : sadcen ] . in appendix 1 , after some notation is established in the next section , we propose an algorithm for defining the characteristic scales in the finite amplitude size forcing case . *",
    "the assumptions here are slightly weaker than the ones in @xcite : in particular a5 and a6 replace the stronger assumption of @xcite that there exists one topologically transverse primary homoclinic orbit which depends continuously on @xmath0 , a property which may be easily violated in applications .",
    "relaxing this assumption requires the introduction of a new labelling scheme for the homoclinic points which takes into account the possible annihilation of primary homoclinic points .",

    "denote by @xmath48 @xmath49 the _ topologically transverse primary _ homoclinic _ orbits _ of @xmath29 belonging to the left branch ( for simplicity of notation we consider hereafter only the left branch of the loop ) , where @xmath50 , namely the discrete index @xmath51 denotes iterations under the map and the index @xmath52 denotes the label of the specific orbit .",

    "each component of the boundary can not intersect itself , and by lemma [ uinout ] they can not intersect transversely each other either , so the only source of non - trivial topology may stem from tangencies .",

    "we conclude that in case there are no intersections between these two sets they correspond exactly to the entry and exit sets of @xmath212 . however , if such intersections exist , the two sets are different .",
    "we provide an example which demonstrates that when such intersections exist the measure of the entry and exit sets depends on @xmath214    _ we therefore conclude that while the notion of entry and exit sets appears more elegant , it has a major flaw from a dynamic point of view - it is not invariant with respect to the regions definition .",
    "_    another problem arising from the definition of the entry and exit sets has to do with self intersection of the lobes ( for close geometry , in the limit of highly stretched lobes ) .",
    "indeed , the boundaries of the entry and exit sets may depend on the appearance of non - primary homoclinic orbits .",
    "the appearance of such orbits is expected to depend sensitively on parameter values .",
    "equivalently , the proposition regarding the smooth dependence of the lobes area on parameters is proved for the sum of their areas , @xmath190 ( see [ sumed ] ) , and not for the area of the lobes union .",
    "in fact , any definition of flux which depends on homoclinic orbits of higher order ( namely not primary homoclinic orbits ) must be carefully examined due to the recent results on richness of chaos @xcite in the neighborhood of a homoclinic tangency .",
    "hence , we define the flux into a region using the concept of the sum of lobes areas :    consider a frequency spanning homoclinic family .",
    "the _ scaled flux function _ of this family is : @xmath215    [ cor : conflux]the flux function of a frequency spanning homoclinic family depends continuously and has a continuous derivative ( is @xmath3 ) in the frequency spanning parameter .    by proposition [ prop : c1areas ] and assumptions a3 and a7 .",
    "notice that the scaled system defines a scaled flux function . substituting the scaling function ,",
    "we observe that the flux function is scaled by the typical area and time scale associated with travelling along the homoclinic loop , as appropriate : @xmath216",
    "consider a frequency - spanning homoclinic family .",
    "then , in the scaled system ( [ schamsys ] ) the scaled flux function ( eq ( [ fluxdef ] ) ) depends non - monotonically on the scaled frequency @xmath217    recall that by corollary [ cor : conflux ] the flux function depends continuously on @xmath0 and that @xmath218 as @xmath219 , the system ( [ schamsys ] ) approaches the adiabatic limit . then , by corollary [ melimit ] of appendix 2 ,  @xmath220 , which implies , by assumption a3 and a7 , that @xmath221 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath118 ( the first primary homoclinic bifurcation value ) is bounded away from zero , it follows from a3 that there exists a @xmath222 such that @xmath223 and @xmath224 is monotone in the interval @xmath225 $ ] . on the other hand , as @xmath226 , averaging of the scaled system ( [ schamsys ] ) implies that the separatrix splitting is exponentially small in @xmath227 ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath228 exponentially as @xmath229 ( where @xmath230 , and by a3 @xmath231 ) , and so does @xmath224 .",

    "this proves that @xmath224 is non - monotone in @xmath4    we now discuss some of the implications of the non - monotone behavior of the flux function , see @xcite for a fluid mixing application of these results .",
    "first , we notice that in the near - integrable case , when the number of primary homoclinic orbits is fixed , the flux function is proportional to the amplitude of the melnikov integral .",
    "hence the above theorem proves that the melnikov function amplitude is non - monotone in this case , which indeed explains the non - monotone figure one typically gets in numerous calculations of the melnikov integral ( e.g. forced duffing s , forced cubic potential , forced pendulum ) .",
    "it is clear that very small ( large ) flux corresponds to a small ( large ) chaotic region near the separatrix , hence , it was suggested that the melnikov function amplitude gives a good characteristic to the amount of chaos in the system .",
    "however , we proved that the flux function is non - monotone in the spanning parameter .",
    "it is therefore natural to compare the dynamics , and the properties of the chaotic region at equi - flux parameter values .",
