    "we begin by recalling two closely related operads .",
    "the first is the _",
    "little 2-discs _ operad of boardman and vogt , denoted @xmath0 .",
    "the arity @xmath1 space , @xmath2 , is the space of embeddings of the disjoint union of @xmath1 discs into a standard disc , where each disc is embedded by a map which is a translation composed with a dilation . at the level of spaces ,",
    "group complete algebras over this operad are 2-fold loop spaces , and at the level of homology an algebra over @xmath3 is precisely a gerstenhaber algebra .",
    "the second operad is a variant of the little 2-discs ; it is the _ framed little 2-discs _ operad , denoted @xmath4 , first introduced by getzler @xcite . here",
    "each little disc is allowed to be embedded by a composition of a _ rotation _ in addition to a dilation and translation , so in particular , @xmath5 .",
    "getzler observed that algebras over the homology operad @xmath6 are precisely batalin - vilkovisky algebras , and at the space level the second author and wahl @xcite proved that a group complete algebra over @xmath4 is a 2-fold loop space on a based space with a circle action .",
    "tamarkin @xcite first proved that the operad @xmath0 is _ formal _ over @xmath7 , meaning that the singular chain operad @xmath8 is quasi - isomorphic to the homology operad @xmath9 .",
    "his proof is algebraic in nature , using braid groups and drinfeld associators .",
    "kontsevich @xcite sketched a different proof of this formality theorem over @xmath10 which generalizes to show formality of the little @xmath11-discs for all @xmath12 . roughly speaking ,",
    "kontsevich works dually , constructing a cooperad of cochain complexes of graphs which maps to both the cochains and the cohomology of @xmath0 by quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "the full details of kontsevich s proof have been explained nicely by lambrechts and volic @xcite .",
    "the kontsevich proof method has the advantage over tamarkin s proof of simultaneously proving the formality in the sullivan dga sense of the individual spaces of the operad .",
    "recently severa and willwacher @xcite have shown that the quasi - isomorphisms of kontsevich and tamarkin are homotopic for a particular choice of drinfeld associator .",
    "tamarkin s proof of formality for @xmath0 has been adapted to the operad @xmath4 by severa @xcite , and kontsevich s proof has been adapted to @xmath4 by the present authors in @xcite .",
    "both adaptations are relatively straightforward .",
    "operad formality theorems have significant applications .",
    "the formality of @xmath0 plays an important role in tamarkin s proof @xcite of kontsevich s celebrated deformation quantization theorem , and the formality of @xmath13 for @xmath14 is a primary ingredient in the computation of the homology of spaces of long knots in high dimensions @xcite .",
    "formality of the operad @xmath4 is used in @xcite to construct chain level homotopy bv - algebra structures for topological conformal field theories and for the 2-fold loop space on a space with a circle action , as well as to give a particular solution to the cyclic deligne conjecture .",
    "unlike @xmath13 , the operad @xmath15 has the additional structure of being homotopy equivalent to a _",
    "cyclic operad _",
    "( see @xcite for an explicit cyclic model ) ; being a cyclic operad means roughly that the roles of inputs and outputs can be interchanged .",
    "the present paper was motivated by the question of whether the formality of the operad can be made compatible with the cyclic structure .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative when @xmath16 . in section [ cyclic - model ]",
    "we will recall a cyclic model @xmath17 for @xmath4 constructed in terms of compactified moduli spaces of genus zero curves with marked points .",
    "the elements of @xmath17 are genus zero stable curves decorated with real tangent rays at the marked points and nodes .",
    "the operad composition is obtained by gluing stable curves at marked points and tensoring the corresponding rays .",
    "this model was first introduced by kimura - stasheff - voronov @xcite , and it is closely related to the modular operad of deligne - mumford compactified moduli spaces of curves whose formality is proved in @xcite .",
    "moreover @xmath17 is homotopy equivalent , as a cyclic operad , to the operad of genus zero riemann surfaces with boundary , where the operad composition is defined by gluing along boundary components .",
    "the main result of this paper is :    [ main ] the cyclic operad @xmath18 of singular chains on @xmath17 with real coefficients is quasi - isomorphic as a cyclic operad to its homology , @xmath19 , which is the batalin - vilkovisky operad .",
    "the new and important point of this theorem is that the chain of quasi - isomorphisms is compatible with the _ cyclic _ operad structure . a second point , coming out of the proof",
    ", is that this operad formality simultaneously realises the formality of the individual spaces of the operad in the sullivan commutative dga sense , as was the case for the kontsevich proof in the unframed case .",
    "this cyclic formality has a consequence in computing the cohomology of diffeomorphism groups of 3-dimensional handlebodies , as discussed further below .",
    "it is not immediately clear that the previous operad formality proofs given in @xcite and @xcite are compatible with the cyclic structure , nor is it clear that they are compatible with the formality of the individual spaces of the operad .",
    "however , since the completion of this work severa has indicated how to show that his formality proof is in fact compatible with the cyclic structure . as for the other proof , the kontsevich graph complex , as modified for the framed 2-discs operad in @xcite , in arity @xmath1 has an action of the enlarged symmetric group @xmath20 ( this action would be part of the cyclic operad structure ) by linear automorphisms , but it is not clear if this action respects the differential .",
    "it seems likely that the action is in fact compatible , but proving this appears to be a very difficult combinatorial problem .    instead",
    ", here we take a more conceptual approach and build a new manifestly cyclic operad of `` projective graph complexes '' as a replacement for kontsevich s graph complexes .",
    "the differential is now a combination of both edge deletions and edge contractions .",
    "the projective graph complexes do form a cyclic cooperad .",
    "our proof of theorem [ main ] then follows in outline the method used by kontsevich in the unframed case .",
    "the projective graph complexes map onto the cohomology of @xmath17 , and they also map to the ( semi - algebraic ) forms on @xmath17 by a variation of kontsevich s map defined by certain configuration space integrals . we prove that both of these maps are quasi - isomorphisms and are compatible with the cyclic cooperad structures .",
    "the theorem then follows by dualising .    for @xmath21",
    "the question of formality of @xmath15 as a cyclic operad , or even just as an ordinary operad , remains open . in future work",
    "we hope to address this .      in the forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", the first author proves that the modular operad generated by the cyclic operad @xmath17 is homotopy equivalent to the modular operad made from @xmath22s of handlebodies .",
    "this leads to a bousfield - kan spectral sequence computing the cohomology of @xmath23 for @xmath24 a handlebody of genus @xmath25 .",
    "theorem [ main ] implies that this spectral sequence degenerates at the @xmath26 page .",
    "( note that formality as an operad rather than a cyclic operad is not enough to imply degeneration of the spectral sequence . )",
    "the framed little 2-discs operad @xmath4 is homotopy equivalent to a cyclic operad , ( although it is not itself cyclic on the nose ) .",
    "a convenient cyclic model was introduced in @xcite .",
    "we recall that model and discuss some of its properties .",
    "recall that a _",
    "cyclic operad _ is an extension of the concept of operad in which inputs and outputs are on equal footing ; this can be formalised by asking that the @xmath27 action on the arity @xmath1 space extends to an action of @xmath20 in a way compatible with the operad composition maps .",
    "the notion of a cyclic operad was first introduced by getzler and kapranov @xcite .    in more detail , a cyclic operad in a symmetric monoidal category @xmath28",
    "is defined by the following data : a functor @xmath29 from the category of non - empty finite sets and bijections to @xmath28 , and for each pair of finite sets @xmath30 with elements @xmath31 a composition morphism , @xmath32 natural in @xmath33 and @xmath34 and satisfying the following axioms .    * * ( associativity ) * given finite sets @xmath35 , and elements @xmath36 , the following diagram commutes : @xmath37 * * ( commutativity ) * given finite sets @xmath30 and elements @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the following diagram commutes : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the canonical bijection @xmath42 .",

    "dually one defines a _ cyclic cooperad _ by reversing the arrows in the definition .",
    "concretely , a cyclic cooperad is specified by the data of a functor @xmath29 from finite sets and bijections to @xmath28 , and a co - composition map @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are auxiliary points ) for each partition @xmath54 .",
    "these co - composition maps must satisfy dual versions of the naturality , symmetry , and associativity conditions .",
    "a cyclic ( co)operad in the category of chain complexes is called a _ differential graded cyclic ( co)operad_.      we now recall the moduli space operad introduced by kimura , stasheff and voronov in @xcite . in their notation , the operad is denoted @xmath55 , but we prefer @xmath17 as being more consistent with other notations .",
    "this operad is manifestly a cyclic operad , and we will show in proposition [ operad - equivalence ] that its underlying operad is homotopy equivalent to the framed little 2-discs operad .",
    "given a non - empty finite set @xmath56 , let @xmath57 denote the moduli space of genus zero riemann surfaces with marked points labelled by @xmath56 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the space of injective maps from @xmath56 to the complex projective line , and the automorphism group @xmath60 acts on the target in the standard way .",

    "the points of @xmath67 correspond to stable nodal riemann surfaces , ( _ nodal _ means that the surfaces are allowed to have double - point singularities , and _",
    "stable _ in this case means that no irreducible component is a sphere with strictly fewer than 3 points that are either nodes or marked points ) . for @xmath68",
    "there is a complex line bundle @xmath69 over @xmath67 whose fibre over a given riemann surface @xmath70 is the tangent space at the @xmath71 marked point .",
    "the boundary , @xmath72 , is a normal crossing divisor .",
    "it has an irreducible component for each unordered partition @xmath73 into two subsets of cardinality at least 2 , and the corresponding component is canonically isomorphic to @xmath74 .",
    "the inclusions @xmath75 define a cyclic operad structure on the deligne - mumford - knudsen moduli spaces .    the space @xmath76 is defined as the real oriented blowup of the boundary locus of @xmath77 .",
    "we pull the complex line bundles @xmath78 back from @xmath77 ( and denote them by the same symbol ) .",
    "the space @xmath76 can be interpreted as the moduli space of genus zero stable nodal riemann surfaces with points marked by @xmath56 and equipped with the additional data of a ray in the tensor product of the two tangent spaces at either side of each node .",
    "it can be constructed as the iterated _ real oriented _ blowup of @xmath63 along _ all _ intersections of hyperplanes , by blowing up first the proper intersections in the same order as for the deligne - mumford space , and finally the hyperplanes themselves .",
    "the space @xmath77 is a compact smooth manifold with _ faces _ ; i.e. it is a manifold with corners , stratified with the interior as the unique codimension 0 stratum and all of the positive codimension strata lying on the boundary , each of which is a transversal intersection of faces ( codimension 1 strata ) .",
    "faces correspond to unordered partitions of @xmath56 into two subsets @xmath79 of cardinality at least 2 ; given such a partition , the corresponding face is canonically isomorphic to the unit circle bundle of the exterior tensor product @xmath80 over @xmath81    let @xmath82 denote the ( coarse ) moduli space of genus zero smooth surfaces equipped with points marked by @xmath56 with real tangent rays .",
    "explicitly , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the circle bundle associated with the tangent bundle of @xmath85 . observe that there are diffeomorphisms @xmath86 in particular , @xmath87 is compact for @xmath88 .    when @xmath65 , @xmath87 is noncompact . forgetting the tangent rays at the marked points gives a trivial principal @xmath89-bundle @xmath90 which extends uniquely to a trivial torus bundle over @xmath91 .",
    "we call its total space @xmath92 . note that the trivialisation of the bundle is not canonical .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath93 one sees that @xmath94 is a compactification of @xmath87 obtained by adding boundary and corners , and hence it is homotopy equivalent to its interior . when @xmath88 we simply define @xmath95 .",

    "recall that a homotopy equivalence of topological operads is a morphism of operads ( a natural transformation commuting with the composition and unit maps ) that is level - wise an equivariant homotopy equivalence .",

    "this is immediate in arity @xmath123 in higher arity , note that blowing up the sphere @xmath124 at the diagonal @xmath125 is the same as blowing up @xmath126 at the hypersurfaces @xmath127 . blowing up all other diagonals identifies @xmath128 , and thus we have diffeomorphisms @xmath129 compatible with the operad composition , by definition .",
    "for the proof of theorem [ main ] , we will need to work in the category of semi - algebraic spaces .",

    "passing to the semi - direct product with @xmath118 , it follows that @xmath122 is an operad in semi - algebraic manifolds .",
    "finally , we must verify that the action of @xmath27 on @xmath132 is semi - algebraic .",
    "for this it is convenient instead to @xmath27-equivariantly embed @xmath133 by evaluating angles between rays for pair of points and the cross ratio for 4-tuples of points .",
    "this shows that @xmath134 acts semi - algebraically on @xmath94 .",
    "forgetting subsets of the marked points defines a collection of important projections between the various moduli spaces . given a subset @xmath135 , let @xmath136 be the map induced by forgetting all marked points labelled by @xmath46 .",

    "the fibres of the bundle @xmath140 are manifolds with faces , so the fibrewise boundary is stratified into pieces of codimension 1 ( in the total space ) and greater .",
    "we shall refer to the codimension 1 strata as the _ fibrewise boundary components_.

    "given a partition @xmath153 as above , we will write @xmath154 for the corresponding fibrewise boundary component of @xmath137 .      fibrewise orientations of the canonical projections play an important role in the formality proof in this paper . here",
