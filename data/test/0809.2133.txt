    "such high-@xmath2 cavities allow for deterministic atom - photon coupling in a near or far - off resonant configuration that elicit linear or kerr - like nonlinear atomic response .",
    "these processes are central to some of the pioneering proposals  single photon sources  @xcite , quantum bus protocols  @xcite , quantum computation and communication schemes  @xcite  and demonstrations of quantum - phase gate  @xcite , quantum memory  @xcite and photon blockade  @xcite .",

    "worse still , oscillations in the photon intensity due to poorly matched pulses are serious source of error . here",
    "we show that the use of appropriate dynamic control breaks these limitations and reduces required cavity @xmath0 by two orders of magnitude compared with passive schemes , and at the same time realizes high - fidelity faster quantum gate .",
    "the dynamic control approach used here modifies the cavity - waveguide coupling , from high @xmath0 during confinement to low @xmath0 during in / out - coupling , with a tuning time much shorter than the photon lifetime of the cavity  @xcite .",

    "specifically , the state of an atom inside a cavity is controlled by the photonic occupation of the cavity via usual jaynes - cummings interaction in the strong coupling and dispersive regime .",
    "using a two - cavity setup , we show that quantum interference allows high reflectivity and optimal photonic confinement of the interaction cavity . through an adiabatic process controllable by the switch",
    ", ultra low and relatively fast transfer of excitations between the interaction cavity and waveguide is possible . to generate a scalable architecture for quantum computing ,",
    "this form of cz gate is integral to coupling between matter - based qubits where stationary - to - flying qubit interconversion is used .",

    "[ fig : schem](a ) , we need a cavity of low bandwidth and strong atom - cavity coupling to effect a phase - flip via scattering .",
    "to illustrate our points , we consider an implementation in the optical regime with nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) diamond defect center in a pbg cavity fabricated in diamond .",
    "the center is placed at the maximum of the cavity mode with wavelength near the zero - phonon line resonance of the center @xmath27  nm and frequency 2.95  phz .",
