    "inflation in the early universe @xcite is now an indispensable ingredient of modern cosmology not only to explain the global properties of homogeneous and isotropic space with a vanishingly small spatial curvature but also to account for the origin of the primordial curvature perturbation that seeded cosmic structure formation @xcite . at present , despite the significant progress in the state - of - the - art precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) by wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite missions , there is no single observational result in conflict with the single - field inflation paradigm @xcite . in particular , the anti - correlation of the temperature and the e - mode polarization anisotropies on large scales observed by the wmap mission",
    "strongly supports the superhorizon perturbations suggested by inflation @xcite .    in other words , once inflation sets in , virtually all the available cosmological observation data can be explained simultaneously irrespective of the initial condition of the universe",
    "this does not mean that we may be indifferent to the initial condition of the universe before inflation .",
    "on the contrary , in order to achieve complete understanding of the cosmic history , we must work out the very beginning of the universe that may smoothly evolve into the inflationary phase .    as is well known , as long as the null energy condition ( nec ) is satisfied in the expanding phase , the hubble parameter and the energy density of the universe increase backward in cosmic time .",
    "so , it is often claimed that , if one tries to discuss what happened before inflation and/or how inflation started , one needs to know the information of very high energy physics , and challenge the initial singularity problem @xcite in terms of quantum gravity .",
    "but , this is not always the case .",
    "recently , it was recognized that , if an action includes higher derivative terms of a scalar field like the galileon terms , the nec can be violated without encountering ghost nor gradient instabilities .",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review and ref .",
    "@xcite for a subtle issue of nonlinear instabilities .",
    "if the nec is violated , the energy density can grow as time proceeds , contrary to the conventional wisdom . in the nec violating theories , the universe can therefore start from the static zero - energy state described by the minkowski spacetime from infinite past  @xcite , and the universe starts expansion with the increase of the energy density .",
    "such a picture of the emergence of the universe was first proposed by creminelli _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with the name galilean genesis . in their model , however , the hot big bang state was postulated to be realized after the effective field theory description breaks down as the energy density blows up beyond its realm of validity .",
    "therefore , the theory to describe the most important epoch of the early universe is lacking there .",
    "nevertheless , since their original idea is so interesting that a number of extension has been made in a wider class of scalar field theories  @xcite and various aspects of the genesis scenario have been explored in the literature @xcite , such as avoidance of the superluminal propagation of perturbations and absence of primordial tensor perturbations .",
    "they have been unsuccessful , however , to realize transition from the genesis phase to the hot big bang state within their model lagrangians .    in this paper , we take a different approach , namely , to make use of the galilean genesis to explain the initial condition of the universe before inflation and smoothly connect it to the inflationary phase , thereby solving the initial singularity problem @xcite and the trans - planckian problem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in inflationary cosmology .",
    "in fact , such an approach has also been put forward by pirtskhalava _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently .",
    "their model lagrangian , however , gives rise to gradient instability as it is , although it has been argued there that higher - order structure of the effective field theory for perturbations possesses enough freedom to cure the gradient instability .",
    "discussion on termination of inflation and reheating is not presernted there , either .    in the present paper ,",
    "we construct a specific model free from any catastrophic instabilities and with subluminal velocities of primordial perturbations . in our setup",
    "the universe starts from the minkowski spacetime from infinite past and is smoothly connected to the inflationary phase followed by the graceful exit . for this purpose , we provide a generic lagrangian capable of describing the background and perturbation evolution in all the above phases instead of choosing the effective field theory approach because the latter can not capture the evolution of the background and perturbations from pre - inflationary genesis to the exit from inflation with the same single lagrangian .",
    "although we start with asymptotically minkowski space at the past infinity for aesthetic beauty , it has been shown that the galilean genesis solution is an attractor for a variety of initial conditions including those with a negative hubble parameter and/or finite curvature , provided that the time derivative of the scalar field has the right sign @xcite .",
    "the horndeski theory  @xcite or the generalized galileon @xcite , whose mutual equivalence was first shown in @xcite , is known to be the most general scalar - tensor tensor theory with the second - order field equations , and thereby avoid ostrogradski instabilities in spite of having higher derivative terms in the action .",
    "the theory can be generalized to have second - order field equations only in a specific gauge while maintaining the number of propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "this possibility was realized recently by gleyzes _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and was extended further by gao  @xcite .",
    "the number of propagating degrees of freedom in these theories is indeed shown to be the same as that of the horndeski theory  @xcite . in this paper , we use the subclass of gao s framework as a concrete realization of the unified scenario starting from galilean genesis through inflation to the graceful exit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a framework of our model and derive the background equations of motion and the quadratic actions of cosmological perturbations . in sec .",
    "iii , a concrete lagrangian is constructed to describe our scenario beginning from the genesis phase through the inflationary one to the graceful exit , and such a background dynamics is presented explicitly . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the stability during each phase based on the quadratic actions of cosmological perturbations . in sec .",
    "v , a concrete realization of our scenario is given .",
    "the final section is devoted to our conclusions and discussion .",
    "let us start with describing the general framework to construct and study our explicit realization of the early - time completion of inflation .",
    "we would like to consider theories composed of a metric @xmath0 and a single scalar field @xmath1 , and hence it will be appropriate to work in the horndeski theory .",
    "the lagrangian of the horndeski theory is of the form @xmath2,\\label{horndeski - l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the four - dimensional ricci scalar , and @xmath5 is the four - dimensional einstein tensor .",
    "we have four arbitrary functions of @xmath1 and @xmath6 in the horndeski theory .",
    "this is the most general lagrangian having second - order field equations .",
    "nevertheless , it will turn out that this framework is insufficient for our purpose , and hence we have to go beyond the horndeski theory .",
    "one can generalize the horndeski theory to possess higher order field equations while maintaining the number of propagating degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the first step to do so is to perform an adm decomposition by taking @xmath7 const hypersurfaces as constant time hypersurfaces . in the adm language ,",
    "the metric is written as @xmath8 by definition @xmath1 is a function of only @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath9 , so any function of @xmath1 and @xmath6 can be regarded as a function of @xmath9 and the lapse function @xmath12 , provided that @xmath13 and @xmath14 never vanish .",
    "then , the horndeski lagrangian  ( [ horndeski - l ] ) can be written in terms of the adm variables as @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the extrinsic and intrinsic curvature tensors on the constant time hypersurfaces , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are subject to the relations @xmath23 variation of the above lagrangian with respect to @xmath12 gives a second - class constraint that eliminates only one degree of freedom , as opposed to general relativity .",
    "the key trick to generalize the horndeski theory is to notice that this property remains the same even if one liberates @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the restriction imposed by eq .",
    "( [ ab - constraint ] )  @xcite .",
    "we thus arrive at the so called glpv theory that is more general than horndeski but has the same number of propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "one can move back to a covariant form of the lagrangian by introducing the unit normal to the constant time hypersurfaces as @xmath24 , writing the extrinsic curvature tensor in terms of @xmath25 , and using the gauss - codazzi equations .",
    "since there are six arbitrary functions of @xmath9 and @xmath12 in the adm form , the resultant covariant lagrangian has six arbitrary functions of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .    the above idea has been pushed forward by gao  @xcite , who proposed a unified framework to study single scalar - tensor theories beyond horndeski .",
    "one can write a general lagrangian in the adm form as @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 , ... are arbitrary functions of @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian depends nonlinearly on @xmath12 as in the glpv theory , giving rise to a single scalar degree of freedom on top of the traceless and transverse gravitons  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will employ the lagrangian @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are constant parameters of the theory .",
    "this is a deformation of the glpv lagrangian and belongs to a subclass of gao s framework .",
    "the generalization to this level is sufficient for the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the glpv theory is recovered by taking @xmath34 .",
    "given the lagrangian  ( [ ourlag ] ) in the adm form , one can restore the scalar degree of freedom @xmath1 to write its covariant expression in the same way as in the glpv theory .",
    "however , it will be more convenient for our purpose to use the explicitly time - dependent lagrangian , because by doing so one can easily design the lagrangian so as to admit the desired cosmological evolution .    before specifying the suitable form of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , ... to construct our early universe model , let us derive the general equations governing the background and perturbation dynamics of cosmologies based on the lagrangian  ( [ ourlag ] ) .",
    "the adm variables are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the curvature perturbation in the unitary gauge and @xmath39 is the transverse and traceless tensor perturbation .",
    "a spatially flat background has been assumed and the spatial diffeomorphism invariance was used to write @xmath40 in the above form . in the following , the background value of the lapse function is denoted by @xmath12 where there is no worry about confusion .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ adm - cosmological ] ) to the lagrangian  ( [ ourlag ] ) , we obtain the background part of the lagrangian as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . at the background level , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 just rescale @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in what follows",
    "we simply consider the case with @xmath45 .",

    "however , we allow for a negative sound speed squared , @xmath65 , for a short period of time . in the absence of the @xmath66 term ( @xmath56 ) , a negative sound speed squared would cause a rapid growth of instabilities for large @xmath67 modes . in this paper , we consider theories with @xmath62 , so that the curvature perturbation with large @xmath67 can be stabilized by requiring that @xmath68 .    as will be seen in the rest of the paper ,",
    "the sound speed squared becomes negative at the transition from one phase to another .",
    "such a behavior should not occur even for a tiny period because high wavenumber modes would grow exponentially rapidly .",
    "however , we could not avoid it not only within the horndesky theory but also the glpv theory despite we analyzed extensive models . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not been successful in proving that this is an inevitable consequence . since our primary purpose is to show an existence proof of the model to realize our intended cosmic evolution without any instabilities , we construct a specific model by going beyond the glpv theory and invoking the @xmath66 term .",

    "the above forms of @xmath79 are chosen so that the theory admits an inflationary universe preceded by the generalized galilean genesis while retaining much of the generality .",
    "other choices could be possible and hence we do not claim that this is the most general description of such scenarios at all . instead , as we mentioned above , we would provide the existence proof of desired models by demonstrating that a sufficiently wide class of healthy models can indeed be constructed .",
    "we design @xmath69 so as to implement the ( generalized ) galilean genesis followed by inflation and a graceful exit from the prolonged inflationary phase .",
    "our choice is @xmath80 well before @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "as our time variable starts at @xmath84 with asymptotically minkowski spacetime configuration , @xmath9 is large and negative in the beginning , so we find @xmath85 in eq .",

    "this leads to the generalized galilean genesis solution  @xcite : @xmath96 it is required that @xmath97 to guarantee @xmath98 .",

    "those two terms are also irrelevant to the stability conditions during the genesis phase .",
    "the galilean genesis phase will end at @xmath106 since the function @xmath76 is constant for @xmath83 .",

    "is followed by coherent field oscillation of the inflaton scalar field which decays to radiation to reheat the universe . in the present approach the scalar field @xmath1",
    "is used to specify constant time hypersurfaces , so that @xmath13 may not vanish in order to preserve one - to - one correspondence between @xmath1 and the cosmic time @xmath9 .",
    "hence one must switch from the adm language we used to construct the action to the conventional `` @xmath1 language '' at this point in order to apply the standard reheating mechanism , which is all right but looks like sewing a fox s skin to the lion s .    here",
    "instead we consider another reheating mechanism which can take place without breaking the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath9 , namely , the gravitational reheating due to the change of geometry or the cosmic expansion law  @xcite .    during the transition from the de sitter inflation to a decelerated power - law expansion , conformally non - invariant particles are produced with the initial energy density @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a factor determined by the effective number of conformally noninvariant fields and the change of the geometry .",
    "for example , for @xmath119 or 4 , a single minimally coupled massless scalar field contributes to @xmath118 by @xmath120 respectively @xcite . here",
    "@xmath121 is the time required for the transition . in case",
    "it is nonminimally coupled with a coupling parameter @xmath122 , a factor @xmath123 is multiplied there .    in order for the radiation thus created to dominate the universe , the energy density of the scalar field must dissipate more rapidly , namely , @xmath124 then , the reheating temperature at the radiation domination is given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and we have assumed the universe would evolve in the same way as in the einstein gravity after inflation . if long - lived massive particles are copiously produced at the gravitational particle production , the reheating temperature may be significantly higher then the above value . furthermore , the decay of quasi - flat direction may produce a large amount of entropy to reheat the universe efficiently and create matter particles  @xcite .    at this point one may wonder if standard particle production due to the decay of the inflaton might work in our scenario . in such a reheating process , the inflaton decay ( and the associated energy loss of the inflaton ) must be very efficient in order to avoid the dominance of the inflaton energy density in comparison to that of produced radiation . for this reason the inflaton must oscillate after inflation .",
    "however , in our construction of the action in the adm language , the field @xmath1 is used to specify constant time hypersurfaces and so @xmath1 and the cosmic time @xmath9 have a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "therefore , our approach can not describe the oscillatory phase of the inflaton and we need to resort to gravitational reheating instead of the standard reheating scenario due to the inflaton decay .",
    "we expect that a different action based on the @xmath1 language instead of the adm language can accommodate the oscillatory phase as well as the genesis and inflationary phases .",
    "minimum modification would be such that one moves to the @xmath1 language at the end of inflation to construct a @xmath1-lagrangian that admits the standard reheating scenario after inflation .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the present paper and is left for future work .",

    "in this paper , we have introduced a generic description of galilean genesis in terms of the adm lagrangian and constructed a concrete realization of inflation preceded by galilean genesis , _",
    "i.e. _ , the scenario in which the universe starts from minkowski spacetime in the asymptotic past and is connected smoothly to the inflationary phase followed by the graceful exit .",
    "our model utilizes the recent extension of the horndeski theory , which has the same number of propagating degrees of freedom as the horndeski theory and thus can avoid ostrogradski instabilities .",
    "this approach allows us to cover the background and perturbation evolution in all the three phases with the same single lagrangian , as opposed to the effective field theory approach . in our scenario ,",
    "the sound speed squared during the transition from the genesis phase to inflation becomes negative for a short period .",
    "however , thanks to the nonlinear dispersion relation arising from the fourth - order derivative term in the quadratic action , modes with higher momenta are stable and the growth rate of perturbations with smaller momenta is finite and under control .",
    "it should also be noted that the sound speed of the primordial perturbations can be smaller than unity by choosing the parameter of the model appropriately .",
    "although we have constructed our inflation model in order to resolve the initial singularity and possible trans - planckian problems by incorporating galilean genesis phase before inflation , we could make use of our model to realize the original galilean genesis scenario , which is an alternative to inflationary cosmology , simply by taking vanishingly short period of inflation there .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , the sound speed squared becomes negative at the transition also in this case , but the instabilities are relevant only for small @xmath67 modes thanks to the @xmath66 term in the dispersion relation .",
    "thus , the transition from the genesis phase to the reheating stage is described in a healthy and controllable manner .",
    "in fact , it would be fair to say that such a cosmology works quite well among the proposed alternatives to inflation , because , in contrast with the bouncing cosmology , in which all the would - be decaying modes in the expanding universe such as vector fluctuations and spatial anisotropy severely increase in an undesirable manner , the genesis solution is an attractor and generation of nearly scale - invariant curvature perturbation is also possible with an appropriate choice of model parameters @xcite .",
    "since no first - order tensor perturbation is generated in this type of scenarios , detection of tensor perturbation with its amplitude larger than @xmath274 would be a smoking gun of inflation .",
    "this work was supported in part by the jsps grant - in - aid for scientific research nos .",

    "and ( b ) the lapse function @xmath12 around the genesis - reheating transition .",
    ", height=377 ]      in the main text , we consider the scenario in which galilean genesis is followed by inflation . in this appendix",
    ", we will go back to the original motivation of galilean genesis and study how we can match smoothly the genesis phase to the reheating phase .",
    "our approach based on the adm lagrangian is quite useful in analyzing such a situation as well .",
    "it is now obvious that by taking @xmath275 and gluing the two functions smoothly at around @xmath276 , one can describe the genesis - reheating transition . as a concrete example , we glue @xmath277 and @xmath278 smoothly at around @xmath276 and perform a numerical calculation as shown in figs .  [ fig : hn - g - r.eps ] and  [ fig : stability - g - r.eps ] .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those taken in the main text .",
