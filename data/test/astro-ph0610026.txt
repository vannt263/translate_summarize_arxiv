    "the accelerated expansion of the universe has now been confirmed by several independent observations including those of high redshift type ia supernovae , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) combined with the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",

    "this latter statement is dynamical in nature and therefore requires some assumptions to be made about the form of gravitational field equations governing the evolution of the ( observed part of the ) universe .",
    "although observationally well established , no single theoretical model provides an entirely compelling framework within which cosmic acceleration or de can be understood .",
    "indeed , the very many models of de existing in the literature illustrate that its nature is still very much an enigma . at present , all existing observational data are in agreement with the simplest possibility of de being a cosmological constant @xmath2 with @xmath3gev@xmath4 ( inside @xmath5 error bars in the worst case ) .",
    "is used throughout the paper . ]",
    "this case is internally self - consistent and non - contradictory .",
    "the extreme smallness of the cosmological constant expressed in either planck , or even atomic units means only that its origin is _ not _ related to strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions ( in particular , to the problem of the energy density of their vacuum fluctuations ) . where @xmath6 is some characteristic neutrino rest - mass ( the lightest one ? ) suggests that vacuum energy of the interaction responsible for non - zero neutrino rest - masses may be relevant for a non - zero @xmath2 . ]",
    "although in this case de reduces to only a single fundamental constant we still have no derivation from any underlying quantum field theory for its small value .    within this context it is but natural that other possibilities admitting a ( slightly ) variable dark energy have also been actively studied by the scientific community in recent years .",
    "moreover , it is interesting that properties of the currently observed ` late de ' are _ qualitatively _ similar to those of an ` early de ' which is believed to have given rise to accelerated expansion ( inflation ) in the early universe .",
    "however in the case of the latter , there are sufficient grounds to support the view that ` early de ' was unstable and , thus , more complicated than a cosmological constant .",
    "so , it is natural to conjecture by analogy that the same might also be true of ` late de ' .",
    "de models proposed to account for the present cosmic acceleration include : +",
    "( i ) quiessence with @xmath7 , the @xmath2 ( @xmath8 ) is a special member of this class .",
    "+ ( ii ) quintessence models which are inspired by the simplest class of inflationary models of the early universe and employ a scalar field rolling down a potential @xmath9 to achieve late - time acceleration .",

    "+ ( iii ) the chaplygin gas model ( cg ) has the equation of state @xmath11 and evolves as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the redshift , @xmath14 .",

    "+ ( xi ) holographic dark energy , etc .",
    "+ see the reviews @xcite for an exhaustive list of models and references .",
    "however , none of these models leads to the reduction of the number of fundamental constants ( parameters in the microscopic lagrangian ) as compared to standard @xmath2cdm .",
    "in other words , at the current state - of - the - art , de requires at least one new parameter whose value is set from observations .",
    "models with variable de can be broadly divided into two main classes :    , in these models de is the energy density of some new , very weakly interacting physical field .",
    "( otherwise dubbed modified gravity models ) . in these models",
    "the gravity equations do not coincide with those of einsteinian general relativity .",
    "however , it is usually possible to re - write the new equations in the conventional _ einsteinian _ form by transferring all additional terms from the l.h.s . into the r.h.s . of the einstein equations and referring to them as an effective energy - momentum tensor of de ( see sec . 2 below ) .",
    "( precisely this happened to the cosmological constant which originally appeared in the l.h.s .",
    "of einstein s field equations but is now felt by many to constitute an effective matter term such as vacuum energy , etc . )",
    "another category , which is even more important from the observational point of view , arises in response to the question whether or not the description of de requires a new field degree of freedom (= a new kind of matter ) .",
    "if the answer is in the affirmative then de may be considered as being ` induced ' by other kinds of matter .",
    "all physical de models and many geometrical ones belong to this category but there do exist geometrical de models which do not ( for instance the @xmath18 model with the palatini variation of its action ) .    faced with the increasing proliferation of de models each with its own physical motivations and assumptions , a concerned cosmologist can proceed in either of two ways :    \\(i ) test _ every single _ model against observations .",

    "before attempting to determine its properties , we first need to provide a definition of _ dark energy_. a traditional approach is to use the einstein form of the gravitational field equations [ einst ] r _ - 12g_r = 8 g ( _ a t_^(a ) + t_^de ) as providing a _ definition _ of the effective energy - momentum tensor @xmath20 of de . here , the summation over @xmath21 in the r.h.s .",

    "+ one should stress here that using ( [ einst ] ) we automatically ascribe terms describing ( possible ) gravitational interactions between de and non - relativistic matter , as well as the matter energy - momentum tensor multiplied by a change in the effective gravitational constant , to the de energy - momentum tensor .",

    "@xmath27 is the total density of non - relativistic matter in terms of its critical value .",
    "similarly , the expression for the deceleration parameter q - a / ah^2 =   x - 1 ,   x = 1 + z [ eq : decel1 ] ( prime implies differentiation with respect to @xmath28 ) takes the form : p_de = ( q - )  .",

    "the eos makes physical sense .",
    "however , this is not so for geometrical de for which the acceleration of the universe is caused by the fact that the field equations describing gravity are not einsteinian .",
    "as a specific example of geometrical de consider the widely studied dgp braneworld @xcite for which [ eq : dgp ] h = +  , where @xmath30 is a new length scale and @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer respectively to the four and five dimensional planck mass . the acceleration of the universe in this model arises not because of the presence of de but due to the fact that gravity becomes five dimensional on length scales @xmath33 .",
    "the contrast between ( [ eq : acc ] ) and ( [ eq : dgp ] ) makes it abundantly clear that for models such as dgp the eos in ( [ eq : state ] ) is an _ effective _ quantity ( @xmath34 ) , which may still be useful for descriptive purposes but which no longer represents any fundamental physical property of an accelerating universe .",
    "indeed , instances are known when @xmath35 even when matter itself satisfies the weak energy condition @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "it may be instructive to note that , for geometrical de , @xmath1 may show pathological behaviour in certain cases , such as the presence of poles at finite values of redshift , @xmath37 , even though the underlying cosmological model is completely well behaved ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "for such models , the deceleration parameter @xmath38 and other geometrical parameters prove to be more robust for determining de properties than the eos .",
    "we shall return to these important issues in section [ sec : statefinder ] .",
    "observational tests of de rely on an accurate measurement of at least one of the following quantities :    1 .   the luminosity distance [ eq : lumdis ] = _ 0^z  .",
    "the angular size distance [ eq : angdis ] d_a(z ) = _ 0^z  .",
    "the coordinate distance [ eq : coordis ] r(z ) = _ 0^z  .    here",
    ", we have assumed that the universe is spatially flat for simplicity .",
    "note that the distance duality relation @xmath39 which follows from ( [ eq : lumdis ] ) and ( [ eq : angdis ] ) is valid only for metric theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "its violation ( if observed ) could , therefore , be used to probe alternative theories of gravity .",
    "existing data , however , appear to support it ( within observational errors ) @xcite .    in all of the above expressions the value of the hubble parameter",
    "can be ` reconstructed ' through a relation similar to the one given below for the luminosity distance @xcite : [ eq : h ] h(z)=^-1  .",
    "differentiating a second time allows one to reconstruct the equation of state of de ( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : state ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) immediately inform us that @xmath1 will be a noisier quantity than @xmath0 since two successive differentiations are needed for the reconstruction @xmath40 while a single differentiation suffices for @xmath41 .",
    "this has led several people to suggest @xmath0 ( or @xmath42 ) as being better suited for providing a model independent description of properties of de .",
    "another important difference between @xmath0 defined in ( [ eq : h ] ) and @xmath1 in ( [ eq : state ] ) is that the former is independent of the value of the matter density parameter @xmath27 while the latter is not . as a result",

    "the form of these functions depends upon the kind of data used and its constraining capabilities @xcite .",
    "we end this section by noting that the reconstruction approach has also been extended to scalar - tensor gravity @xcite , string inspired cosmology with the gauss - bonnet term coupled to a scalar field @xcite and dark energy with non - canonical kinetic energy terms @xcite .",
    "other applications of cosmological reconstruction may be found in @xcite .",
    "non - parametric smoothing usually involves directly smoothing either @xmath95 , or some other quantity appropriately binned in redshift space with some characteristic smoothing scale .",
    "different ways of implementing this approach have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "all reconstruction methods must deal with the fact that the data sample is usually sparse and the coverage of redshift space uneven .",
    "consider for instance the comoving coordinate distance to a single supernova within a larger sample r_i = r(z_i ) + n_i  . here",
    ", @xmath135 is the noise term @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is related to the distance modulus @xmath138 of the supernova by @xcite @xmath139",
    ". direct differentiation of @xmath140 to give @xmath141 will obviously result in a very noisy quantity .",
    "one way to tackle this is to fit @xmath142 piece - wise using a set of basis functions . following this approach , daly and djorgovsky @xcite reconstructed the deceleration parameter from the dimensionless coordinate distance @xmath143 by : ( i ) fitting @xmath144 locally within a small redshift bin by means of a second order polynomial requiring that at least 10 data points lie within each bin ; ( ii ) determining the first and second derivatives of @xmath144 from the fit coefficients ( for each bin ) and reconstructing the deceleration parameter from @xmath144 by means of the relation -q(z ) = 1 + ( 1+z )  . applying their method to a set of radio galaxies in addition to type ia sne , daly and djorgovsky @xcite found that although the cosmological constant provided a very good fit to the data , modest evolution in the dark energy density was also perfectly acceptable .",
    "the transition from deceleration to acceleration occured at @xmath145 , with a best fit value of @xmath146 .",
    "these results are in broad agreement with those obtained using parametric approaches @xcite .",
    "a different approach to non - parametric reconstruction is discussed by shafieloo @xcite who generalize a smoothing ansatz widely used in the analysis of large scale structure . according to this method",
    ", a smoothed quantity @xmath147 is constructed from a fluctuating ` raw ' quantity @xmath148 using a low pass filter @xmath19 having a smoothing scale @xmath126 d^s(*x * , ) = d(*x * ) f(|*x*-*x*| ; )  d*x *  . in large scale structure studies , @xmath149 is the density field @xcite whereas for cosmological reconstruction @xmath149 could be either of @xmath150 .",
    "commonly used filters include : ( i ) the ` top - hat ' filter , which has a sharp cutoff @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the heaviside step function ( @xmath153 for @xmath154 , @xmath155 for @xmath156 ) and ( ii ) the gaussian filter f_g  .",
    "when applied to snap - quality data using a gaussian filter , this method reconstructs the hubble parameter to an accuracy of @xmath157 within the redshift interval @xmath158 . the look - back time t(z)=t(z=0)-t(z)=h_0",
    "^ -1_0^z is reconstructed to an even better accuracy of @xmath159 at @xmath160 .    despite the considerable success of these approaches , neither they , nor the parametric methods discussed earlier provide independent measurements of either @xmath0 or @xmath38 within a given redshift range .",
    "one approach towards an uncorrelated determination of cosmological quantities is to bin the data in redshift bins of size @xmath126 with a weight ( or window ) function assigned to each bin @xcite .",
    "each window function vanishes outside its redshift bin and the two supernovae falling on either side of a bin boundary are discarded .",
    "this method ensures that , since two adjacent window functions have no common supernovae , the measurement of quantities within these bins will have uncorrelated error bars .",
    "this method is quite successful and complements other reconstruction approaches in many respects .",
    "one weakness , which practitioners of this approach have to guard against is that , since some information at the bin boundary is lost , discontinuities in the fit values at bin edges may be present @xcite .",
    "these , in turn , could lead to unphysically large derivatives of derived quantities such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "results obtained by applying a variant of this method to recent cmb+sne+lss data are shown in figure [ fig : wangm ] and appear to agree with the results of the parametric approach in figure [ fig : eos ] .",
    "other promising methods for obtaining uncorrelated estimates of cosmological evolution are discussed in @xcite .    in all of the above approaches , it is important to choose the value of the smoothing scale @xmath126 ( or bin size )",
    "optimally , so that ( i ) a sufficient number of data points is accommodated within each bin to reduce the effects of shot noise , ( ii ) the bin size is not too large to cause excessive smoothing .",
    "the following useful formula giving the relative error bars on @xmath0 comes to our aid @xcite [ eq : tegmark ] , where n is the total number of supernovae ( assuming an approximately uniform distribution ) and @xmath161 is the noise of the data .",
    "clearly , a reduction in the value of @xmath126 by 3 should be compensated for by having 27 many times more supernovae if one wants to keep @xmath162 unchanged .",
    "the situation is far worse for @xmath1 which has a @xmath163 scaling , since the data are being differentiated twice to get @xmath1 .",
    "with respect to cosmological reconstruction , considerable caution must be exercised when setting priors on the values of cosmological parameters .",
    "this is true both for the density parameter @xmath27 whose value is currently known to about @xmath164 accuracy and the de equation of state .",
    "maor @xcite gave a particularly insightful example of the dangers of incorrect reconstruction by assuming a fiducial de model with @xmath165 and an evolving eos @xmath166 .",
    "in their reconstruction , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig : maor ] , it was assumed that @xmath167 was a constant and , additionally , that @xmath168 .",
    "these two ( incorrect ) priors led to a gross underestimation of @xmath167 and an overestimation of @xmath27 as shown in figure [ fig : maor ] .",
    "the above example shows that the eos of dark energy can be badly reconstructed if we assume a misleading prior for @xmath169 .",
    "since @xmath1 depends upon the value of @xmath27 through ( [ eq : state ] ) , it follows that an incorrect assumption about the value of the matter density has the potential to affect cosmological reconstruction quite significantly .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : arman ] in which the de eos is reconstructed for a fiducial @xmath2cdm model with @xmath170 and @xmath165 .",
    "cosmological reconstruction is based on the ansatz ( [ eq : poly_fit ] ) in which the _ incorrect _ value @xmath171 is assumed .",
    "this results in the reconstructed eos evolving with redshift when , in fact , no such evolution is present in the fiducial model !",
    "as we have seen , the eos has certain blemishes  it is obtained from @xmath95 after differentiating _ twice _ and it is sensitive to the _ precise _ value of @xmath55 .",
    "both these features hamper its reconstruction which has led several authors to propose the hubble parameter or the de density as being more appropriate for cosmological reconstruction @xcite .",
    "carrying these ideas further , the possibility of extracting information about the equation of state from the reconstructed hubble parameter by constructing a _ weighted average _ of the equation of state was explored in @xcite .",
    "this quantity , dubbed the @xmath169-probe , gleans information about the equation of state from the _ first derivative _ of the luminosity distance .",
    "therefore , it is less noisy and better determined than @xmath1 .",
    "the weighted average of the equation of state is defined as @xcite [ eq : weight1 ] 1+|w= ( 1+w(z ) ) .",
    "an important feature of the @xmath169-probe ( @xmath172 ) is that it can be expressed in terms of the difference in dark energy density over a given redshift range [ eq : weight2 ] 1+|w(z_1,z_2 ) & = &   + & & ( )  .",
    "+ here @xmath130 denotes the total change of a variable between integration limits and @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "thus @xmath172 is easy to determine if the hubble parameter has been accurately reconstructed .",
    "an important property of @xmath172 is that it is less sensitive to uncertainties in the value of @xmath55 than @xmath1 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : margin ] where the results for @xmath172 are shown after marginalizing over the matter density .",
    "remarkably , the value of @xmath172 for the fiducial @xmath2cdm model remains close to @xmath175 , while @xmath172 for the evolving de model shows a clear signature of evolution .",
    "thus , small uncertainties in the value of the matter density do not appear to adversely affect the accuracy of the reconstructed @xmath169-probe .",
    "furthermore , several excellent methods for determining @xmath176 and @xmath0 have been suggested in the literature @xcite , any of which could be used to determine @xmath172 using ( [ eq : weight2 ] ) .",
    "cosmological observations made during the past two decades have brought about both qualitative and quantitative changes in our perception of the universe .",
    "observational support has come for many theories ( such as inflation ) which earlier were regarded as being at the level of hypothesis . on the other hand , fundamentally new properties of our universe , such its current state of acceleration ,",
    "have also been unravelled .",
    "the remarkable qualitative similarity between current acceleration ( fueled by de ) and inflationary acceleration ( supported by what may be called primordial dark energy ) may help us understand in which direction cosmology may be headed .",
    "the discovery by cobe of an approximately scale - invariant spectrum of primordial fluctuations ( @xmath177 ) was regarded by many as providing tacit support for the inflationary scenario .",
    "however , virtually all models of inflation predict small departures from the scale invariance @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is a model dependent quantity .",
    "strict scale invariance ( @xmath180 ) arises for a specific 2-parameter family of inflaton potentials only @xcite , which reduces to @xmath181 in the slow - roll approximation . in this context",
    ", the recent 3-year data release of the wmap experiment suggests @xmath182 , which is in excellent agreement with predictions made by the simplest inflationary models such as chaotic inflation with @xmath183 .    the present situation concerning de resembles , in some respects , the status of inflation just after the release of the cobe data in 1992 .",
    "the cosmological constant is in excellent agreement with data and departures ( if any ) from @xmath184 are believed to be quite small . nevertheless , since at present no fundamental theory predicting the ( small ) value of the @xmath2-term exists , it is of utmost importance that departures from @xmath184 be probed to accuracies of at least @xmath109 by future generations of experiments . since virtually all de models ( other than @xmath2 )",
    "have either @xmath185 or @xmath186 , the need for probing both the equation of state as well as its first derivative become crucial if any deep insight is to be gained into the nature of de .",
    "it is useful to recall that several de models which agree well with the current data arise because of modifications to the gravitational sector of the theory @xcite . for these _ geometrical de _",
    "models , the eos no longer plays the role of a fundamental physical quantity and it would be very useful if we could supplement it with a diagnostic which could unambiguously probe the properties of all classes of de models .",
    "the @xmath169-probe discussed earlier , provides one such method , since it is based on the expansion history @xmath187 . since the expansion factor @xmath25 is an essential feature of all metric theories of gravity , it is worthwhile trying to explore the properties of de by considering the generic form [ eq : taylor0 ] a(t ) = a(t_0 ) + a_0 ( t - t_0 ) + ( t - t_0)^2 + ( t - t_0)^3 + ...  .",
    "cosmic acceleration appears to be a fairly recent phenomenon @xcite , so we can confine our attention to small values of @xmath188 in ( [ eq : taylor0 ] ) .",
    "the second and third terms in the rhs of ( [ eq : taylor0 ] ) have played a crucial role in the development of cosmology .",
    "indeed , for a long time the large errors in @xmath189 and @xmath190 impaired a precise picture of cosmic expansion and only recently has the sign of @xmath191 been determined to sufficient accuracy for us to make the statement that the universe is accelerating .",
    "links the ricci scalar @xmath17 to @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , an accelerating ( @xmath192 ) spatially flat universe corresponds to @xmath193 . ] keeping in mind the significant progress expected in observational cosmology over the next decade , we feel the time to be ripe to supplement @xmath194 and @xmath191 with @xmath195 , which is the next logical step in the hierarchy of cosmological parameters .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath196 for the spatially flat @xmath2cdm model which is the ` standard ' cosmological model at present , as well as for the cdm model .",
    "supplementing @xmath197 ( the first statefinder ) with the second statefinder @xmath198 permits us to break this degeneracy and to characterize different de models in a very informative manner .",
    "was also dubbed the cosmic jerk in @xcite . ]",
    "the statefinder pair @xmath199 is a ` geometrical ' diagnostic since it depends upon @xmath25 and hence upon the space - time geometry .",
    "an important property of the statefinder is that spatially flat lcdm corresponds to the fixed point _",
    "lcdm = 1,0  .",
    "[ eq : fixedpt ] so the basic question of whether de is the @xmath2-term or ` something else ' can be rephrased into whether the equality ( [ eq : fixedpt ] ) is satisfied for de . indeed , the departure of a de model from @xmath200 provides a good way of establishing the ` distance ' of this model from lcdm @xcite .",
    "the fact that different classes of de models show distinctly different behaviour when plotted in the @xmath199-plane adds to the practical utility of this diagnostic .",
    "see figure [ fig : statefinder ] and @xcite for some applications of the statefinder .",
    "finally , the pair @xmath199 can also be expressed in terms of @xmath201 quite simply [ eq : statefinder1 ] r & = & 1 + ( 1+w ) - , + s & = & 1+w- .",
    "it is instructive to note that the second statefinder can be rewritten as @xcite s=(+ p)p   [ eq : statefinder2 ] where @xmath202 is the _ total _ pressure including that of de . from ( [ eq : statefinder2 ] ) we find that @xmath203 is very sensitive to the epoch when the total pressure in the universe vanishes . for @xmath2cdm ,",
    "this takes place at the redshift @xmath204 , when the positive radiation pressure cancels the negative pressure in @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , @xmath205 as @xmath206 . in general , the redshift @xmath207 at which the total pressure in the universe becomes zero is quite sensitive to the nature of de .",
