    "since the discovery of the gravitational radiation driven instability of the @xmath0-modes by andersson ( 1998 ) and friedman & morsink ( 1998 ) , a large number of studies on the properties of @xmath0-modes and inertial modes of rotating stars have been done to prove their possible importance in astrophysics ( for a review see , e.g. , friedman & lockitch 1999 ; andersson & kokkotas 2000 ) .",
    "although early investigations were mainly applied to young hot neutron stars ( e.g. , lindblom , owen , & morsink 1998 ; owen et al .",
    "1998 ) , recently some authors have also discussed possible roles of the @xmath0-mode instability in old and cool neutron stars with a solid crust and a magnetic field , such as those found in low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( e.g. , andersson , kokkotas , & stergioulas 1999 ; bildsten & ushomirsky 2000 ; rezzolla , lamb , & shapiro 2000 ; yoshida & lee 2001 ) .",
    "although our understandings of @xmath0-modes have been largely improved by recent energetic investigations as mentioned above , most studies concerning @xmath0-modes have been done in the framework of newtonian gravity . as for @xmath0-modes in the framework of general relativity , kojima ( 1998 ) found possible existence of continuous spectrum for pure @xmath0-mode in relativistic stars . here throughout this paper we call the rotational mode whose eigenfunctions are composed of only one axial parity component in the non - rotating star limit `` pure @xmath0-mode '' .",
    "beyer & kokkotas ( 1999 ) generally verified the existence of a continuous spectrum .",
    "kojima s formalism was developed to that with high order rotational effects by kojima & hosonuma ( 1999 ; 2000 ) .",
    "very recently , lockitch , andersson , & friedman ( 2001 ) have shown that pure @xmath0-modes in a relativistic star can exist only in non - isentropic stars , whose specific entropy distribution of a star is not constant . as for rotation",
    "induced modes in isentropic stars , they have shown that modes similar to inertial modes , namely hybrid modes , in a newtonian rotating star ( see , e.g. , lockitch & friedman 1999 ; yoshida & lee 2000 ) , whose eigenfunctions are composed of both polar and axial parity components , exist in uniform density stars ( see also lockitch 1999 ) .    in the study by lockitch",
    "( 2001 ) , they derived the basic equation for the pure @xmath0-mode in relativistic non - isentropic stars . their equation is the same as that obtained by kojima ( 1998 ) .",
    "as mentioned by kojima ( 1998 ) , this equation has a continuous part of frequency as its solution when the system of equations is that of the singular eigenvalue problem .",
    "kojima ( 1998 ) also pointed out that the system of the equation becomes that of the regular eigenvalue problem when the frequency domain is in some range .",
    "for such a regular eigenvalue problem , discrete eigenfrequencies may exist for the same equation as well as continuous ones .",
    "lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have studied the relativistic @xmath0-mode characterized by the regular eigenvalue problem . in their study",
    "discrete @xmath0-mode solutions for the regular eigenvalue problem in uniform density stars were obtained .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that such discrete @xmath0-mode solutions correspond to those of newtonian @xmath0-mode .",
    "however their study was restricted to the case of uniform density stars .",
    "as mentioned in the next section , the frequency range for the regular eigenvalue problem is confined to the narrow region and depends on the structure of equilibrium stars .",
    "furthermore , needless to say , relativistic effects on stellar oscillations in a neutron star are not negligible .",
    "thus , it is interesting and important to answer to the question of whether @xmath0-mode solutions for the regular eigenvalue problem exist in all non - isentropic relativistic stars . in this paper , therefore , we study the @xmath0-mode characterized by regular eigenvalue problem for large class of polytropic and non - isentropic relativistic stellar models .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start , in  2 , with brief description of our method of solution . in  3 , we describe the properties of the @xmath0-mode characterized by the regular eigenvalue problem in both the relativistic and the post - newtonian stellar models .",
    " 4 is devoted for discussions and conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we will use units in which @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the velocity of light and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "we consider slowly rotating relativistic stars with a uniform angular velocity @xmath11 , where we take account of the first order rotational effect in @xmath11 .",
    "the geometry around the equilibrium stars can be described by the following line element ( see , e.g. thorne 1971 ) : @xmath12 once an equation of state , @xmath13 for a perfect fluid is given , we can easily obtain the structure of the slowly rotating stars , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote pressure , mass - energy density and specific entropy , respectively . throughout this paper , the polytropic equation of state",
    "is assumed : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants .",
    "we consider oscillation modes in rotating relativistic stars such that the eigenfunctions are stationary and are composed of only one axial parity component in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "subclass of those modes should be a relativistic counterpart of @xmath0-modes , which are able to oscillate in all slowly rotating newtonian fluid stars . according to lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , such modes are allowed to exist only if the star has non - isentropic structures .",
    "therefore , we assume stars to be non - isentropic , although the effects due to deviation from isentropic structure on oscillation modes do not appear in the first order in @xmath11 .",
    "according to the formalism by lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see , also , kojima 1998 ) , let us write down the pulsation equation for relativistic @xmath0-modes with accuracy up to the first order in @xmath11 . the metric perturbation @xmath21 and the eulerian changes of the fluid velocity @xmath22 that do not vanish in the limit @xmath20 are given as @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 are usual spherical harmonic functions , and @xmath26 denotes oscillation frequency measured in the inertial frame .",
    "all other perturbed quantities become higher order in @xmath11 .",
    "note that this form of eigenfunctions is the same as that for zero - frequency modes in a spherical non - isentropic star , because @xmath0-modes become zero - frequency ones in the limit @xmath20.(thorne & campolattaro 1967 ) the metric perturbation @xmath27 obeys a second order ordinary differential equation , @xmath28   \\nonumber \\\\    & + & 16 \\pi ( p+\\epsilon ) h_{0,l}=0 \\ , , \\label{b - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 here , we have introduced the effective rotation angular velocity of fluid , @xmath30 and the corotating oscillation frequency , @xmath31 the velocity perturbation of fluids @xmath32 is determined from the function @xmath27 through the following algebraic relation , @xmath33\\ , u_{l}+h_{0,l}=0   \\ , .",
    "\\label{b - eq2}\\ ] ] equations ( [ b - eq ] ) and ( [ b - eq2 ] ) are our basic equations , which were derived by kojima ( 1998 ) in his early work .",
    "note that equations ( [ b - eq ] ) and ( [ b - eq2 ] ) lose the meaning for the @xmath34 case , because there are no axial modes with @xmath34 .    because equations ( [ b - eq ] ) are second order ordinary differential equations , two boundary conditions are required to determine solutions uniquely . for physically acceptable solutions , the function @xmath27 must vanish both at the center and at the spatial infinity .",
    "thus , boundary conditions are given as @xmath35 when those boundary conditions are imposed , our basic equations are solved as an eigenvalue problem with an eigenvalue @xmath36 . as shown by kojima ( 1998 ) , when @xmath37 is satisfied inside the star the system of our basic equations becomes a singular eigenvalue problem , because the function @xmath38 is proportional to the coefficient of the second derivative of function @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", we can treat the equation as a regular eigenvalue problem if @xmath37 is not satisfied inside the star , because the last term of equation ( [ b - eq ] ) vanishes outside the star as well as the function @xmath38 . due to this singular property of the basic equation ,",
    "kojima also concluded continuous spectrum may exist in relativistic rotating stars .",
    "beyer & kokkotas ( 1999 ) gave a mathematically rigorous proof for the existence of a continuous part within the spectrum .",
    "recently lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have showed that the equality @xmath37 must be satisfied at some spatial point for the equations to have non - trivial solutions @xmath27 . because @xmath39 is a monotonically increasing positive function of @xmath0 , according to the considerations of lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , in order for the equation ( [ b - eq ] ) to be treated as a regular eigenvalue problem an frequency @xmath36 must be in a region , @xmath40 where @xmath7 is stellar radius in the coordinate ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath41 is well - known newtonian @xmath0-mode frequency . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath36 satisfies an inequality , @xmath42 we must treat equation ( [ b - eq ] ) as singular eigenvalue problem .",
    "note that since @xmath39 becomes @xmath11 in newtonian limit , we can easily see from inequalities ( [ dis - sp ] ) and ( [ con - sp ] ) that frequency in a range for existing non - trivial solution of equation ( [ b - eq ] ) is getting closer to newtonian @xmath0-mode frequency , @xmath41 , as @xmath43 .",
    "lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also found numerically discrete @xmath0-mode solutions with frequencies in range ( [ dis - sp ] ) in uniform density relativistic stars . in this paper",
    "we will extend the study on the discrete @xmath0-mode solutions by lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to those for polytropic equation of states .",
    "next let us consider a post - newtonian approximation of relativistic @xmath0-mode oscillation , by using a similar method to that of lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in this approximation ,",
    "physical quantities of an equilibrium state can be written as @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a newtonian lane - emden function ( see , e.g. , kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) and @xmath6 denotes total mass of stars .",
    "here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants determined from a solution of lane - emden equation .",
    "function @xmath52 is given as solution of a differential equation , @xmath53 under the following boundary conditions : @xmath54    in the newtonian limit , @xmath55 , eigensolutions of equation ( [ b - eq ] ) should become those of @xmath0-mode oscillations in newtonian stars .",
    "therefore , eigenvalue @xmath36 and eigenfunction can be expanded in power series of @xmath56 as @xmath57 \\",
    "\\label{sig - exp}\\ ] ] @xmath58 and @xmath59 substituting equations ( [ pn1])-([pn5 ] ) and ( [ sig - exp ] ) into an equation ( [ b - eq ] ) , we obtain basic equations for @xmath0-mode oscillations in the post - newtonian order as follows : @xmath60 + 16\\pi\\,\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{r^2}\\,\\theta^n\\,h^{(0)}_{0,l}(r ) = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath61 these equations have the same properties as those of relativistic equations ( [ b - eq ] ) .",
    "boundary conditions required for physically acceptable solutions are given as follows : @xmath62 and @xmath63 from inequalities ( [ dis - sp ] ) and ( [ con - sp ] ) , frequency range for regular and singular eigenvalue problem in the post - newtonian order equation are given as @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .    because our basic equation for both relativistic and post - newtonian @xmath0-modes become second order linear ordinary differential equations with two boundary conditions , those are numerically solved as an eigenvalue problem , by using a henyey type relaxation method ( e.g. , unno et al .",
    "as mentioned in the last section we should distinguish two cases in treating equation ( [ b - eq ] ) .",
    "one is a regular eigenvalue problem .",
    "the other is a singular eigenvalue problem . in this study",
    "we consider only @xmath0-mode solutions of a regular eigenvalue problem , because discrete eigenfrequency may be obtained .",
    "furthermore such discrete modes are considered to correspond to newtonian @xmath0-modes , because such modes have the well - defined regular eigenfunctions .",
    "therefore we restrict our attention to eigenfrequency in the range ( [ dis - sp ] ) . for simplicity , henceforth , we will naively call a @xmath0-mode solution of a regular eigenvalue problem a discrete @xmath0-mode unless we give a notice .",
    "as mentioned in beyer & kokkotas ( 1999 ) we can not exclude the possibility that isolated eigenvalues may exist within a frequency range for a singular eigenvalue problem .",
    "thus note that such an isolated eigenvalue does not belong to `` discrete @xmath0-mode '' according to the terminology of this paper .",
    "we compute frequencies of a discrete @xmath0-mode for several polytropic stellar models . in present study , only the fundamental @xmath0-modes ,",
    "whose eigenfunction @xmath32 has no node in radial direction except at stellar center , are obtained .",
    "this is consistent with that in newtonian case , where overtone @xmath0-modes appear as high order effects in angular velocity @xmath11 ( see , e.g. provost , berthomieu & rocca 1981 , saio 1982 ) . in figure 1 ,",
    "scaled eigenfrequencies @xmath66 of discrete @xmath0-modes are given as functions of @xmath4 for modes with @xmath67 .",
    "note that for modes associated with @xmath68 , we can directly obtain an eigenfrequency of a mode with any value of @xmath69 from that with @xmath67 .",
    "therefore only results for modes associated with @xmath67 will be shown throughout this paper .",
    "eigenfrequencies for stars with four different polytropic indices , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , are shown in panels in figure 1 , respectively . in each panel ,",
    "frequency curves for the modes with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are depicted along a relativistic factor @xmath4 . from the figure",
    "it is found that frequencies @xmath77 monotonically decrease as a relativistic factor @xmath4 increases .",
    "this behavior is caused by dragging of inertial frame due to the stellar rotation .",
    "we find that some frequency curves in figure 1 are terminated at some value of @xmath4 beyond which equilibrium states can still exist . here",
    ", the maximum values of @xmath4 for polytropic equilibrium stars having @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "it is also found that length of those curves tend to be short as either a polytrope index @xmath18 or an angular quantum number @xmath68 increases . as a matter of fact",
    ", we are not able to obtain eigenfrequencies beyond them by using our numerical method .    in order to trace the cause that missing frequencies in figure 1 can not be obtained ,",
    "let us see behavior of values of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath83 gives a lower bound of the eigenfrequency @xmath77 allowed for the regular eigenvalue problem of a @xmath0-mode in the considered star .",
    "therefore an eigenfrequency @xmath77 for the regular eigenvalue problem must be larger than @xmath83 . in figure 2 ,",
    "values of @xmath83 and @xmath77 for @xmath1 @xmath0-mode of @xmath84 polytropic stars are given as function of @xmath4 .",
    "in this figure it is found that the curve of @xmath77 approaches that of @xmath83 twice , that is , near the newtonian limit , and near the terminal point of the frequency curve .",
    "the former is clear because the frequency range ( [ dis - sp ] ) shrinks to the point of the newtonian r - mode frequency .",
    "the latter is considered to be the cause of our problem . from the figure",
    "it is found that frequency @xmath77 of @xmath0-mode solutions for the regular eigenvalue problem becomes the same value as that of @xmath83 at some critical value of @xmath4 , say @xmath85 , within the numerical accuracy . in other words , @xmath77 nearly becomes the frequency for the singular eigenvalue problem as the value of @xmath4 becomes @xmath85 .",
    "thus we can not obtain those missing modes .",
    "behaviors of @xmath83 and @xmath77 as functions of @xmath4 for other cases except for the @xmath70 case are similar to those in figure 2 . as for the @xmath70 case",
    ", the curve of @xmath77 does not closely approach that of @xmath83 even when the value of @xmath4 is nearly @xmath79 . from those facts and continuity of physical quantities",
    "we can expect that disappearance of @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) is not due to numerical artifact .",
    "thus it is reasonable to claim that @xmath0-mode solutions for regular eigenvalue problem disappear in stars having a values of @xmath4 larger than @xmath85 .",
    "critical values of @xmath4 are shown as functions of polytropic index @xmath18 in figure 3 .",
    "curves of critical values @xmath85 for modes with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are given in the figure .",
    "note that values of @xmath85 shown here are numerically approximated ones .",
    "these only give lower limit of accurate values of @xmath85 . in figure 3 ,",
    "stars whose parameters are in regions under curves of @xmath85 have discrete @xmath0-mode spectrum",
    ". results of our numerical analysis also suggest that for the @xmath70 case the critical value of @xmath4 is nearly equal to @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , discrete @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) may exist in all uniform density stars independently of the value of @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the result by lockitch et al .",
    "the figure also suggests that even in nearly newtonian stars , whose value of relativistic factor @xmath4 is sufficiently small , @xmath0-mode solutions of a regular eigenvalue problem disappear if a value of @xmath18 is over some critical value , say @xmath86 . for such nearly newtonian stars , however , our numerical method tends to lose an accuracy . in the next subsection , to avoid this numerical difficulty , we will study @xmath0-mode oscillations of nearly newtonian stars by using post - newtonian formalism .      in post - newtonian analysis of @xmath0-modes , the post - newtonian correction @xmath87 for the eigenfrequency",
    "is employed as the eigenvalue instead of a scaled eigenfrequency @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath87 does not depend on a relativistic factor @xmath4 by definition ( [ sig - exp ] ) , but both on polytropic index @xmath18 and on angular eigenvalue @xmath68 . in similar way to the case of the relativistic study",
    "we consider only the case that our basic equations become the regular eigenvalue problem .",
    "thus we restrict eigensolutions to those with frequency in a range ( [ pn - dis ] ) . in figure 4 the post - newtonian correction @xmath87",
    "are plotted against polytropic index @xmath18 for three different eigenmodes associated with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "our numerical results of @xmath87 for a @xmath70 polytropic model are in good agreement with those by lockitch et al .",
    "we also can not obtain @xmath0-mode solutions for the regular eigenvalue problem in stars beyond some limits of polytropic index @xmath18 , as shown in the figure .",
    "thus as in the relativistic case , examining behaviors of values of @xmath88 appearing in the frequency inequality ( [ pn - dis ] ) as a function of @xmath18 , we confirm that disappearance of @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ pn - dis ] ) is not due to numerical artifact .",
    "the values of @xmath88 are shown as function of @xmath18 in figure 4 .",
    "it is found that all frequency curves for @xmath87 in figure 4 nearly intersect with the curve for @xmath88 at some values of @xmath18 , namely @xmath89 . in the same way as the relativistic study ,",
    "thus , we can conclude that the absence of the post - newtonian @xmath0-mode solutions for the regular eigenvalue problem in stars having @xmath90 is not due to numerical artifact . from this",
    "we expect that @xmath0-mode solutions with a frequency in a range ( [ pn - dis ] ) disappear if a star has polytrope index @xmath18 larger than a critical value @xmath86 .",
    "values of @xmath86 obtained from numerical analysis are shown in figure 4 near the terminal points of @xmath87 curves .",
    "our numerical results of @xmath86 in the post - newtonian order are consistent with those in relativistic analysis .",
    "( compare with figure 3 ) from the figure , for instance , we can expect that the @xmath0-mode solution with @xmath74 for regular eigenvalue problem disappears in polytope having @xmath91 even in the post - newtonian order .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the properties of @xmath0-modes characterized by regular eigenvalue problem in a slowly rotating relativistic polytrope .",
    "our numerical results suggest that discrete @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) disappear for some polytropic models .",
    "although we do not have mathematically rigorous proof for this suggestion , from numerical results and continuity of physical quantities we can make conjectures on the relativistic @xmath0-mode as follows : the @xmath0-mode associated with @xmath1 , which is considered to be the most important for gravitational radiation driven instability , do not exist as a solution for regular eigenvalue problem for polytropes having @xmath2 even in the post - newtonian order . as for a @xmath3 polytropic model , which is employed as a typical neutron star model , discrete @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) do not exist for stars whose relativistic factor @xmath4 is larger than about @xmath5 . if those conjectures are true , most of typical neutron stars do not have discrete @xmath0-mode solution with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) , because a typical relativistic factor for a neutron star is considered to be about @xmath5@xmath92 .",
    "this means that in actual neutron stars @xmath0-mode characterized by regular eigenvalue problem can not play any important role , if relativistic @xmath0-mode oscillations are governed by equation ( [ b - eq ] ) .",
    "if this is the case , we must study the pure @xmath0-mode with frequency in a range ( [ con - sp ] ) to have clear understanding of relativistic @xmath0-mode in neutron stars . according to previous studies , continuous part of spectrum and singular eigenfunctions",
    "appear for such a frequency range , although we can not exclude the possibility that isolated eigenvalues may exist within the frequency range .    in this study",
    ", we employ the formalism developed by lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to investigate @xmath0-modes in relativistic polytropes .",
    "although their formalism is correct , the system of equation ( [ b - eq ] ) as regular eigenvalue problem leads to some unnatural numerical results .",
    "for instance , @xmath74 @xmath0-mode solutions of regular eigenvalue problem in @xmath3 polytropes having @xmath93 disappear due to general relativistic effect , although @xmath0-mode solutions for regular eigenvalue problem in newtonian stars exist for all slowly rotating polytropic stars with constant angular velocity .",
    "lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) claimed that @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) are counterpart of newtonian @xmath0-modes , because they considered that the true relativistic analogue to a newtonian @xmath0-mode should be a distinct mode with a well - defined eigenfunction .",
    "in fact , such a @xmath0-mode solution may exist in all @xmath70 polytrope , as shown numerically in lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and this study .",
    "however , for some @xmath94 polytropes we numerically found that @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) do not appear when @xmath95 or @xmath90 .",
    "we think that this is actual behavior of the mode due to the influence of the effective differential rotation caused by general relativity .",
    "the reason of this is considered as follows : in modal analysis in newtonian rotating stars , sufficient differential rotation of an equilibrium star can give a corotation point , where corotation frequency @xmath36 vanishes .",
    "because of existence of this corotation point the system may become singular eigenvalue problem .",
    "( see , e.g. karino , yoshida & eriguchi 2000 ) on the other hand , our results show that disappearance of discrete r - mode occurs in large values of the relativistic factor or the polytropic index of the equilibrium star . in such equilibrium stars , as a matter of fact ,",
    "differential rotation effect in relativistic rotating stars becomes strong .",
    "however we can not exclude the possibility that pure @xmath0-modes in a relativistic rotating star with the non - zero rotation frequency are not simply governed by equation ( [ b - eq ] ) , because strictly speaking the equation ( [ b - eq ] ) only determines zero frequency modes in a spherical non - rotating star .",
    "in other worlds , in equation ( [ b - eq ] ) the gravitational radiation reaction is not taken into account at all , although the gravitational radiation must be emitted from @xmath0-mode oscillations in rotating stars with non - zero rotation velocity . as strongly suggested by lockitch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see , also beyer & kokkotas 1999 ) , when the eigenfrequency becomes complex number , which expresses the damping of the oscillation due to the energy dissipation such as the gravitational radiation emission , the existence of the continuous part of spectrum in the eigenfrequency of equation ( [ b - eq ] ) might be avoided .",
    "if this is true , there is a possibility for a distinct mode solution with a well - defined eigenfunction from singular solutions with frequency in a range ( [ con - sp ] ) to be picked up by the information due to the gravitational radiation reaction effect .",
    "such distinct modes may make a continuous sequence that starts with @xmath0-mode solutions with frequency in a range ( [ dis - sp ] ) .",
    "we think this one of the most plausible scenarios , although this is still speculation . in order to have clear understanding of the @xmath0-mode in relativistic stars ,",
    "the further progress of investigations of the rotational mode is needed .",

    "<S> we investigate properties of @xmath0-modes characterized by regular eigenvalue problem in slowly rotating relativistic polytropes . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results suggest that discrete @xmath0-mode solutions for the regular eigenvalue problem exist only for restricted polytropic models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the @xmath0-mode associated with @xmath1 , which is considered to be the most important for gravitational radiation driven instability , do not have a discrete mode as solutions of the regular eigenvalue problem for polytropes having the polytropic index @xmath2 even in the post - newtonian order . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore for a @xmath3 polytrope , which is employed as a typical neutron star model , discrete @xmath0-mode solutions for regular eigenvalue problem do not exist for stars whose relativistic factor @xmath4 is larger than about @xmath5 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 and @xmath7 are stellar mass and stellar radius , respectively . </S>"
