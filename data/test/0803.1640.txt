    "alternative options include a self  interacting scalar field , @xmath4 ( quintessence or dynamical de  @xcite ) and modifications of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "it is known that models with @xmath3 ( @xmath5cdm ) apparently accommodate all available data systems .",

    "de interaction strength , parametrized by @xmath8 ( see below ) , recent works placed constraints on possible couplings , by using snia data  @xcite or the redshift evolution of the hubble parameter , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath100.15  @xcite is hardly consistent with observations .",
    "unfortunately , such a low coupling level no longer eases the coincidence problem  @xcite , but , once the genie has come out from the lamp , it is hard to put it back inside .",
    "the point is whether low values of @xmath8 , as allowed by current data , can interfere with future data analysis . in particular , when we allow for non ",
    "zero @xmath8 , how do errors on other parameters behave ?    in this work we tried to answer this question by using a fisher matrix technique .",
    "we considered two different models , set by similar values of cosmological parameters , without and with coupling . in the latter case",
    ", we took @xmath11 starting from these models , we evaluated the expected errors on cosmological parameters , as obtained when data concern just cmb anisotropy and polarization or include tomographic weak lensing ( wl ) .    as a matter of fact , in coupled models ,",
    "the time evolution of the dark components is non  standard .",
    "if such models are considered in a newtonian approximation , it is as though dm particles had a @xmath4dependent mass .",
    "also for quite low @xmath8 s , this anomalous scaling leaves an imprint on both the expansion history of the universe , and the growth of ( matter ) fluctuations , at the linear and non  linear levels ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , any detected evolution of @xmath9 can be reproduced through a suitable redshift dependence of de density @xmath12 and state parameter @xmath13 , when @xmath4 approaches @xmath14 ( the planck mass ) .",
    "a risk is that , if matter and dark energy are coupled , fitting observations leads to an estimate of a phantom equation of state ( @xmath15 ) , even if @xmath16 at all redshifts  @xcite .    in principle",
    ", this risk can be excluded if the redshift dependence of the growth factor @xmath17 is also tested , through the increase in number and concentration of bound systems .",
    "data providing information both on @xmath18 and @xmath17 are therefore able to discriminate between coupled and uncoupled models . experiments , or combinations of experiments , probing @xmath18 and @xmath17 are then needed .",
    "cmb data , used to constrain coupling  @xcite , place only upper limits on @xmath8 .",
    "the analysis of ly@xmath19 and the matter power spectrum of the 2df and sdss surveys  @xcite does not lead to great improvements . at the available sensitivity level ,",
    "such data systems provide just weighted integrals of @xmath18 and @xmath17 , which remain consistent with a rather wide set of options .    on the contrary , gravitational lensing , alone or in combination with cmb data ,",
    "was already shown to be a powerful tool for the analysis of de .",
    "wl tomography probes the power spectrum @xmath20 at different redshifts and is thus well suited to constrain @xmath21    in this work we aim to put these conceptual points on a more quantitative basis and to deepen the case of coupling , by performing a fisher analysis of future wl surveys and cmb experiments .",
    "the outline of this work is as follow . in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] we review the basic properties and definitions of dde models and wl , in sec .",
    "[ sec : fore ] we show the results of the fisher analysis , in sec .  [ sec : discu ] we discuss them and in sec .",
    "[ sec : summ ] we summarize our findings and draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider a cosmological model where the de field @xmath4 interacts with the cold dm component .",
    "the model requires the specification of the potential @xmath7 and the function @xmath22 characterizing the coupling .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath4 then reads @xmath23 here dots denote ordinary time differentiation , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is dm energy density . in turn , its evolution is governed by @xmath26 this equation can be integrated and gives : @xmath27 for @xmath28 eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq : rho ] ) return ordinary dde equations .",
    "the equations for the other components remain unchanged . in a generic coupled model , then , the ratio between the energy densities of cold dm and baryons is not fixed , but evolves in time according to @xmath22 .",
    "however , it is always possible to define an effective de component of density @xmath29 + \\rho_{de } ( a)~.\\ ] ] in general , @xmath30 is not guaranteed to be positive and detecting @xmath31 would be a clear indication that our description of the dark sector is not adequate .",
    "lacking such clear giveaway , however , experiments probing @xmath18 can hardly discriminate between de ",
    "dm interaction and an _ ad hoc _ de component .",
    "if its effective state parameter @xmath32 is @xmath33 , data may appear to require phantom de ( see  @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "coupling affects also fluctuation growth . in the newtonian limit , _",
    "i.e. _ well below the horizon , and neglecting the contribution of radiation , baryons and dm fluctuations grow according to the equations ( e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath34 , \\end{array } \\label{eq : delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath8 so that @xmath35 while @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , baryons and dm perturbations grow at different rates and , even soon after recombination , a growing mode @xmath37 no longer exists ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lingrowth ] ) , leading to a bias between baryon and dm perturbations .",
    "analytical models of spherical collapse have shown that this differential growth results in a baryon  dm segregation , with baryons occupying the outer regions of collapsed objects  @xcite .",
    "eqs  ( [ eq : delta ] ) also show that the growth equations explicitly depend on both @xmath9 and @xmath25 ; therefore , if we measure the growth from data , a possible anomalous scaling can no longer be masked though an _ ad  hoc _ definition of an effective de density .",
    "it is then licit to conclude that experiments probing the rate of growth of fluctuations are in principle well suited to test coupling between the dark components .",
    "the growth suppression rate @xmath38 for cdm ( solid line ) and baryons ( dashed line ) in a coupled model .",
    "curves refer to a sugra potential with exponential coupling .",
    "it can be noticed that the cold dark matter evolution rapidly diverges from the standard cold dark matter solution , @xmath39 ( dotted line ) , even well into the matter dominated era . for comparison , we also plot @xmath40 for the same sugra model with coupling turned off ( dot  dashed line).,width=377 ]    in this work we are interested to combining wl and cmb data , which can not be accurately described using current parametrisations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we follow a more conventional approach and choose the functional forms @xmath41 the sugra @xcite potential @xmath7 depends on the slope @xmath19 and the energy scale @xmath3 . fixing de density today and @xmath5 ( @xmath19 )",
    ", however , determines a unique value of @xmath19 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "cmb , snia and deep sample data yield @xmath42gev  @xcite , in the absence of coupling . here",
    "we focus on the sugra potential as it naturally arises in the context of supergravity theories and is an example of tracking potential characterized by a rapid time variation of the equation of state , when de becomes dominant . therefore , assuming a constant @xmath43 for this class of potential may lead to misleading results .",
    "different choices for the potential are clearly possible .",
    "the coupling function @xmath22 depends on @xmath8 , and @xmath44 is the field value today . in this work",
    "we assume a constant @xmath45 ( see however  @xcite for a different approach ) ; data place the upper limit @xmath46  @xcite . for reasonable values of the cosmological parameters and of @xmath3",
    ", we expect coupling effects not to be relevant for @xmath47 , so that the dynamically interesting values for the coupling lies in the range @xmath48 .      among the cosmological probes allowing the analysis of the nature of de , the cosmological wl has been earning a fundamental role ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) .",
    "in fact , next generation wl surveys will cover a significant fraction of the sky and observe galaxies at deeper redshift , making wl a powerful tool to study the properties of the universe .",
    "furthermore , wl tomography will allow to significantly increase the cosmological information that can be recovered from such surveys ( see @xcite and @xcite for details about lensing tomography ) .",
    "the power spectrum for the wl convergence between the @xmath49th and @xmath50th redshift bin is given by : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the non  linear matter power spectrum , at the redshift @xmath53 and wave number @xmath54 ; the quantity @xmath55 is the radial comoving distance between @xmath53 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 while @xmath58 is the window function which weights different redshift bins according to the factor @xmath59 , @xmath60 being @xmath61 the i  th redshift bin .",
    "the function @xmath62 is the normalized redshift distribution of the source galaxies falling in the @xmath49-th photometric redshift bin , per unit solid angle , @xmath63^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 the last expression codifies the effect of errors in photometric redshifts of source galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , due to the large number of observed galaxies with future surveys , one needs to refer to their photometric redshifts , even if the determination of these redshifts may be not so accurate as the spectroscopic ones . in the model given by ,",
    "the mapping between the photometric @xmath65 and the spectroscopic redshift @xmath53 is obtained convolving the overall galaxy distribution per unit solid angle , @xmath66 , with a probability distribution @xmath67 in @xmath65 at a given @xmath53 .",
    "we choose a gaussian function at each redshift for the distribution of photometric redshifts , i.e. @xmath68}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the overall distribution of source galaxies is chosen to have the parametrized form : @xmath69 } ,    \\label{eq : distro}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the parameters .",
    "one can easily check that equation turns into : @xmath73,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath74 and @xmath75 the error function .",
    "the cosmic shear power spectrum will receive a shot - noise contribution from the random intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies and measurement error @xcite .",
    "thus , the observed power spectrum between redshift bins @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be expressed as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the rms shear due to intrinsic ellipticity and measurement noise ( we assume @xmath78 @xcite ) and @xmath79    \\left(\\frac1{60}\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right)^{-2}\\hat{n}_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the average number density of galaxies per steradians in the @xmath49-th redshift bin , @xmath80 being the number of galaxies per square arcminute and @xmath81 the fraction of sources belonging to the bin .",
    "the covariance between the power spectra @xmath82 and @xmath83 is approximately given by @xmath84=        \\frac{\\delta_{\\ell\\ell ' } } { ( 2\\ell+1)\\delta\\ell f_{sky } }        \\left[p^{\\rm obs}_{(im)}(\\ell)\\,p^{\\rm obs}_{(jn)}(\\ell ' ) +      p^{\\rm obs}_{(in)}(\\ell)\\,p^{\\rm obs}_{(mj)}(\\ell ' ) \\right ]        \\label{covar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the sky fraction covered by the survey and @xmath86 is the bin width centred at @xmath87 .",
    "the above expression assumes that the power spectrum in each multipole bin is very flat , in order to replace the value of the spectrum evaluated at the bin center with the average of spectrum over each bin ( see [ append : a ] for the complete expression ) .",
    "in addition , we have not included the non - gaussian term , due to the contribution of the shear trispectrum  @xcite .",
    "the fisher matrix formalism @xcite provides lower limits to the error bars of the cosmological parameters one wishes to measure .",
    "the basic tool in fisher s method is the likelihood function , yielding the probability that a model gives the set of data @xmath88 .",
    "suppose we want to test an hypothesis , _",
    "i.e. _ a cosmological model set by @xmath89 parameters @xmath90 . the likelihood function @xmath91 $ ] is often a complicated function of @xmath92 ; the value @xmath93 corresponding to the peak of @xmath94 defines the _ maximum likelihood estimator _ which , in the limit of large data sets , becomes the _ best unbiased estimator _ of the actual parameter set .",
    "thus , the likelihood can be taylor expanded to second order ( the first non  vanishing term ) around @xmath93 , being so approximated with a multivariate gaussian distribution @xmath95 here @xmath96 is a positive semi - definite non - singular matrix , dubbed _ covariance matrix _ of the @xmath97 .",
    "we remind that holds just in a sufficiently small neighborhood around the maximum @xmath93 . in turn , the _ fisher information matrix _ reads @xmath98 the average @xmath99 is taken over all possible data realizations , given the model parameters .",
    "the feature making fisher s formalism so significant is the cramr - rao theorem .",
    "it states that the parameter variance about any unbiased estimator value owns a lower bound : @xmath100 , if the other parameters are estimated from the data as well , @xmath101 , if all the other parameters are known .",
    "therefore , the fisher information matrix components are the expectation values of @xmath102 . accordingly",
    ", the inverse of the fisher matrix is an estimate of the covariance matrix of the parameters @xmath103 .    a convenient way to re ",
    "write the fisher matrix is computing the derivatives of the likelihood function using the following chain rule @xcite : @xmath104 thus , the fisher matrix can be expressed as : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , are the fisher and the covariance matrix for the observables @xmath88 .",
    "the region in the @xmath89dimensional space of the parameters , defined by @xmath108 , is a hyper  ellipsoid of constant probability density for the function .",
    "marginalizing over the other parameters , one can project this ellipsoid in the two ",
    "parameter subspace , yielding a two  dimensional ellipse .",
    "the analytical expression for the projected ellipse for the two parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 is given by @xcite : @xmath111^{-1 }    \\left (    \\begin{array}{c }      \\delta\\theta_{\\alpha}\\\\\\delta\\theta_{\\beta }    \\end{array }    \\right)=\\delta\\chi^2(n=2,\\sigma)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be interpreted as an estimate of the confidence region within a given confidence level @xmath112 for the two parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we present here the results of the fisher analysis of future experiments , considering both wl and cmb measurements . for definiteness",
    "we assume a fiducial wl survey with characteristics similar to those of the recently proposed dune project @xcite .",
    "we assume a redshift distribution of the form with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , corresponding to a median redshift of the survey @xmath116 ( see @xcite ) , and a mean surface density of galaxies @xmath117 .",
    "the full survey , covering half of the sky ( @xmath118 ) , is divided into @xmath119 redshift bins , with @xmath67 given by equation   and @xmath120 .",
    "we consider lensing multipoles up to @xmath121 , since we find that results do not depend significantly on larger @xmath87 .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that when considering scales @xmath122 there could be some non  linear and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum , and so on the wl spectrum @xcite .",
    "these effects , not yet well understood , could be important for forecasts . however , in this work we suppose these effects to be negligible .    for cmb data",

    "the precision on both parameters depends mostly on multipole up to a few thousands ; smaller scales do not provide a significant contribution .",
    "dividing the survey in 5 bins strongly improves the constraints on both parameters and allows to exploit information from multipoles up to @xmath162 . for a dune  like survey , a further increase in the number of bins does not lead to significant improvements on the constrains on coupled models parameters .",
    "it must be outlined that these results assume that the theoretical framework used to predict the matter power spectrum on intermediate ( @xmath163 ) and small ( @xmath164 ) scales can accurately account for the effects of baryons on non  linear structures . in general , the fitting formulas used to predict the non  linear power spectrum are calibrated using dissipationless n  body simulations and , therefore , do not properly describe baryonic structures . while baryons make up @xmath165 of the matter in the universe and on large scales are expected to trace the dm field , their distribution inside halos is significantly different from dm . in turn , this alters the shape of the non  linear power spectrum on the corresponding scales , and the possibility of extracting precision constraints from @xmath166 hinges on our capability of accurately modeling baryon physics  @xcite .",
    "however , simulations do not yet have the accuracy required for precision constraints and the problem is even more serious for the coupled models considered in this work . modelling non linear stages though spherical growth , mainini @xcite shew that baryons and dm will be however differently distributed , even independently of the onset of gas dynamics .",
    "n  body simulations of cde models were performed @xcite , by using a ratra ",
    "peebles @xcite potential ; hydro simulations , instead , were never produced .",
    "should accurate prediction be still unavailable for the analysis of a dune  like experiment , a more conservative cutoff of @xmath167 would be required .",
    "shows that in this case the expected errors on @xmath3 and @xmath8 would increase by a factor @xmath158 .",
    "all previous analysis shows that , even if we admit quite a little dm  de coupling , we open a pandora s box , leading to a severe degradation in our capacity to deduce cosmological parameters from a given set of measures .    as a matter of fact",

    "then the distance behavior is different in the period when de density can be neglected , in respect to the epoch when de and dm have similar densities .",

    ", width=377 ]    future wl surveys will certainly put more stringent constraints on cosmological parameters and will be crucial to break quite a few degeneracies between parameters .    within this context , in this paper",
    "we focus on coupled de models with a twofold aim .",
    "detecting a signal of dm  de coupling would be certainly decisive to fix the nature of the dark components . henceforth determining the level of sensitivity needed to appreciate such an effect is crucial in setting the appeal of forthcoming projects .",
    "there is however a complementary aspect which deserves much attention . in order to convert raw data into physical information ,",
    "a set of parameters , spanning a variety of models , is to be fixed ; a bias on parameter selection , however , can lead to an optimistic estimate of the confidence level for the best fitting model , far from reality .    in this paper , we focused on this kind of danger , when we open the option of dm  de coupling .",
    "even if such coupling is absent or quite weak , we showed that just considering its possibility may widen the error bars for a number of parameters , also apparently unrelated to the coupling itself . in a sense ,",
    "when a new degree of freedom is opened , such an effect is natural and expected .",
    "coupling , however , has really a major impact , affecting different parameters for the different observables considered here ; moreover , its impact is drastically reduced when we work out parameter values by using simultaneously both observables .    before outlining our main conclusions it is however worth reminding a technical limit we had to face .",
    "while cmb predictions depend on linear spectra , the wl spectrum is limited to its non  linear shape .",
    "for the purpose of the present analysis , we assumed that prescription for @xmath3cdm models @xcite can be trivially extrapolated to coupled models , so enabling us to estimate the non linear spectrum once the linear spectrum is known .",
    "let us however remark that the shift was estimated from quite a wide set of @xmath3cdm simulations .",
    "simulations of cosmological models with state parameters @xmath177 , although performed by several authors , are still not so extensively studied as @xmath3cdm ; let alone coupled de simulations : in this case the only available simulations are due to @xcite and deal with a potential @xmath7 different from sugra .",
    "however , differences between prescriptions for @xmath3cdm and dde are small @xcite and it seems however clear that model differences can most affect the rate of evolution of halo concentration , slightly shifting the scale where non  linearity effects become significant .",
    "the use of more precise prescriptions can therefore only cause minor variation on the estimated errors and , although welcome , such simulations are not expected to interfere substantially with our conclusions .",
    "our estimates were based on assuming that a photometric survey is available , with @xmath120 and a median redshift @xmath178 , covering half of the sky ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "these features are similar to the recently proposed dune experiment @xcite .",
    "we also compared and combined results from wl with the constraints expected for an ideal planck  like experiment .",
    "the basic results of our calculations are quoted in table  [ tab : errors ] which is one of the main results of this work .    a first set of conclusions concerns an ideal cmb experiment considered by itself .",
    "in this case , introducing coupling degrees of freedom is crucial for the error estimates on some of parameters , also apparently unrelated to coupling . in particular , while the error on @xmath179 keeps @xmath1801% , the errors on @xmath181 and @xmath131 increase from 1.3% to 3.9% and from 9% to 16% , respectively .    from a physical point of view",
    ", the option opened by coupling is that expansion rate and fluctuation growth , from the last scattering band to the observer s site , is non  standard ( _ e.g. _ , the proportionality law @xmath182 could be mildly violated ) . although cmb data themselves set stringent limits on such deviations , this widens the volume of the parameter space consistent with a given data set ; in particular , it increases the likelihood of values of @xmath183 that would otherwise be negligible and , because of the intercorrelation amongst parameters , this reflects immediately on @xmath181 and @xmath154 estimates .",
    "similar effects occur in wl experiments , although involving different parameters .",
    "such experiments are a direct test of @xmath154 , whose estimated error is reduced by a factor @xmath184 in respect to a cmb experiment .",
    "when the coupling option is opened , the error on @xmath154 does not increase ; on the contrary , it becomes easier to attribute raw data uncertainties to other parameters and , although marginally , the error on @xmath154 becomes somehow smaller .",
    "a completely new situation occurs if both cmb and wl measurements are simultaneously used . in this case",
    ", the opening of the coupling option causes just a marginal increase of the errors on most parameters .",
    "this is a clear indication of the complementarity of the cmb and wl measurements , as described in @xcite and one of our conclusion is that the combination of these observables , besides of providing parameter values independent of @xmath8 , can set a ( nearly)final word on the coupling option .    as a matter of fact , by comparing , and , we see that , when joining cmb and wl results , the degeneracies , between @xmath8 and @xmath131 , as well as between @xmath8 and @xmath154 , disappear . breaking degeneracies is the main aim when different observables are simultaneously considered .",
    "we see that , from this point of view , the efficiency of using both cmb and wl measures can be hardly overestimated .",
    "let us then focus on the case of the spectral index of scalar fluctuations . when both cmb and wl data are used to constrain @xmath147 , a sharp reduction of errors occurs .",
    "no surprise that cmb data , by themselves , reflecting the state of the universe before the onset of non linear processes , were more efficient to constrain @xmath147 , with or without coupling , than wl measures .",
    "joining together the two observables , we then see errors to decrease from 0.4% and 1.2% down to 0.16% , in the uncoupled case ; in the presence of coupling we have a similar behavior , with errors passing from 0.5% and 1.8% down to 0.25% .",
    "the error level achieved , in both cases , is exceptional , even for precision cosmology , and clearly suggests to relieve the constraint of a single @xmath147 value , so inspecting its possible scale dependence , with realistic possibilities to find a direct insight into the nature of the inflationary potential .    in conclusion , future wl surveys could really allow a significant step forward in the comprehension of the dark cosmic side ; we can adfirm that , when they will be available , the endeavour to put the genie back inside the lamp will approach a full success .",

    "in order to determine the convergence power spectrum covariance , one can introduce the so called `` flat - sky '' approximation and treat the sky as flat , replacing spherical harmonic sums with fourier transforms ( ft ) .",
    "of course , this approximation is acceptable just for small angular scales we also consider the tomographic case and use greek letters as superscripts to denote quantities belonging to different redshift bins .",
    "the ft of the convergence field can be defined as : @xmath185 while the convergence power spectrum and trispectrum are , respectively : @xmath186 @xmath187 here @xmath188 is the dirac function .",
