    "i first met bill in 1972 as a student in his graduate courses in statistical mechanics and kinetic theory .",
    "i had the welcome opportunity to work part time at the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) as a `` student employee '' while enrolled in the phd program at the department of applied science ( das ) in the university of california at davis - livermore .",
    "although i had selected a talented thesis advisor , john killeen , who specialized in computational plasma physics , i recall thinking at the time that i would have enjoyed thesis research with bill .",
    "his classes were both stimulating and challenging !",
    "sixteen years later i was a group leader for the national magnetic fusion energy computer center ( nmfecc ) where innovations in computer hardware and software led to the first interactive operating system , to the first unclassified national network , and to the era of the cray supercomputers .",
    "i taught scientists and engineers the implementation and use of algorithms on computers still in the design phase . by then",
    "my interests had broadened to include finite - element simulations .",
    "i helped many plasma physicists to vectorize their software .",
    "one of them , a professor sumnesh gupta from lousiana state university , asked me to arrange a meeting with bill during his visit .",
    "bill is and was decisive .",
    "when i went to check on his meeting with professor gupta he asked me `` how about dinner ? ''",
    "my reply was , `` are you serious ? '' !",
    "that was the beginning of our wonderful life - long partnership .",
    "we were married less than a year later .    in 1988",
    "we visited cornell .",
    "bill met with ben widom and his chemistry colleagues while i met with a group specializing in transputer - based parallel systems .",
    "the crays were becoming prohibitively expensive and were nearing their speed limits .",
    "what we learned at cornell was sufficiently exciting that on our return to livermore we contacted another das phd , tony de groot .",
    "his thesis research analyzed arrays of interconnected low - cost transputers with a fast network , providing a parallel architecture alternative to the vector parallelism used in the cray supercomputers .",
    "tony had a grant to build a prototype system with 64 processors and to demonstrate its speed for an interesting physics or engineering problem .",
    "* figure 1 * shows a snapshot from the project .",
    "tony s work was a perfect match for our interests in a future with parallel computers , molecular dynamics , materials science , and continuum mechanics all linked together .          in 1989",
    "it was time for bill s third sabbatical leave from das .",
    "bill was invited to japan to visit shuichi nos at keio university in yokahama .",
    "i was invited to work with professor toshio kawai , who headed up the same physics department .",
    "we both had supporting grants , bill s from the japan society for the promotion of science and mine a research and teaching grant from llnl .",
    "we spent the academic year 1989 - 1990 in nos s keio university laboratory .",
    "officially i was working with professor kawai , who had an interest in statistical mechanics while bill was working with shuichi nos .",
    "but in reality we both worked together with professor taisuke boku , a parallel - computing specialist , and a physicist sigeo ihara at hitachi s kokubunji laboratory .",
    "our common interest was large - scale molecular dynamics problems involving plastic flow .",
    "this work was coordinated with several colleagues back at livermore as well as brad holian at los alamos .",
    "tony de groot made the project possible .",
    "he successfully designed and built the sprint computer which he could run fulltime , at cray speed , in his office .",
    "we were also collaborating with harald posch in wien on lyapunov spectra for many - body chains and pendula@xcite while writing a book on computational statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "see * figure 2*. bill s son nathan , who had married us back in livermore , was working at teradyne tokyo , and accompanied by his wife megumi , throughout our research leaves in nearby yokohama , leading to many family get - togethers , often with our japanese colleagues and their families .",
    "our biggest project in japan involved a baker s dozen of physicists , engineers , and computer scientists .",
    "the goal was to model , visualize , and analyze million - atom two- and three - dimensional `` plastic flows '' , flows of solids in response to shear stress .",
    "the two - dimensional work allowed us to study the kinetics of grain formation during annealing .",
    "see * figure 3*. the three - dimensional work modeled the indentation of silicon and ductile metals using angle - dependent and embedded - atom force models in the dynamics .",
    "all of this many - body work was carried out on tony s sprint computer .",
    "as fast as a cray , sprint was put together with $ 30,000 worth of transputers rather than $ 30,000,000 of cray hardware .",
    "this collaboration resulted in several papers over a six - year period , one of them with nine authors , three in japan , three in livermore , brad at los alamos , plus bill and me@xcite .",
    "late at night in the kawai lab bill was writing his _ computational statistical mechanics _",
    "book with some help from me .",
    "the background of the 1980s was foundational for our research at livermore : howard hanley s 1982 boulder conference `` nonlinear fluid behavior''@xcite ; nos s two 1984 papers@xcite ; bill s followup `` nos - hoover '' paper@xcite ; and giovanni ciccotti and bill s 1985 fermi school@xcite `` molecular - dynamics simulation of statistical - mechanical systems '' .",
    "these beginnings soon led to the discovery of the ubiquitous fractal distributions stemming from time - reversible simulations consistent with the second law of thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "bill and i , along with many of those in this room , as well as our hundreds of colleagues , have explored and analyzed thousands of different model systems so as to flesh out the connection of time - reversible microscopic mechanics with irreversible macroscopic thermodynamics and computational fluid dynamics .",
    "the goal for this period was a consistent and comprehensive view of macroscopic and microscopic nonequilibrium systems .",
    "these were years of exploration and learning , applying dynamical - systems methods to small and large atomistic simulations .",
    "gibbs phase - space description , augmented by feedback and constraints , relates entropy change to the action of thermostats extracting the irreversible heat generated by velocity or temperature gradients .",
    "here we review a few examples .",
    "we consider macroscopic nonequilibria first , taking up an algorithm resembling _ molecular _ dynamics but developed in order to solve _ continuum _ problems , smooth - particle applied mechanics , spam .",
    "spam was developed in 1977 by lucy and by monaghan and gingold at cambridge@xcite .",
    "they solved large - scale astrophysical problems by ascribing all of the many _ continuum _ properties ( density , velocity , energy , stress , heat flux . . . ) to a mesh - free set of moving",
    "_ particles_. this same idea can be applied to traditional problems in computational fluid dynamics such as shockwave structure and rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "it can also be merged with molecular dynamics , defining an equivalent continuum within which the moving particles serve as interpolation points .",
    "the key idea is the smooth - particle interpolation scheme : localized _ particle _ properties are patched together to generate global very smooth doubly - differentiable _ continuum fields_. these fields are constructed by summing particle contributions with a weight function which has two continuous derivatives at the cutoff distance @xmath0 : @xmath1 [ \\ 1 - ( r / h ) \\ ] ^3 \\ .\\ ] ] the range @xmath0 of the weight function is chosen to include a few dozen particles . for simplicity here we choose to use particles of unit mass .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath2 depends upon the dimensionality @xmath3 of the problem : @xmath4 though ( many ) other weight functions can be used lucy s is the simplest polynomial that satisfies the constraints of a smooth maximum with two vanishing derivatives at the maximum distance @xmath0 .",
    "fluid simulations solve ordinary differential equations for the three particle properties @xmath5 . from these and the gradients which can be derived from them by differentiation all the continuum properties @xmath6 follow : @xmath7    the continuity equation , @xmath8 is an identity with this approach .",
    "it is solved _ automatically _ by summing weight functions , leaving only the equations for @xmath9 to solve for each particle .",
    "for a two - dimensional ideal gas , with @xmath10 , the equation of motion is familiar : @xmath11\\nabla_iw_{ij } = -\\sum_j \\nabla_iw_{ij } \\ .\\ ] ] these motion equations for the smooth particles are _ identical _ , isomorphic to those for a gas with the weak repulsive pairwise - additive potential @xmath12 .    as a simple example of the applicability of spam to molecular dynamics",
    ", we consider the free expansion problem illustrated in * figures 4 and 5*. as the motion proceeds , governed by @xmath12 , this same smooth - particle weighting function can be used to define and measure the local values of the density , internal energy , kinetic energy , and ( local - equilibrium ) entropy fields of the expanding and equilibrating fluid .",
    "let us demonstrate spam by applying it to a difficult problem , the four - fold adiabatic free expansion of a compressed gas into a closed periodic container .      with harald and vic castillo@xcite we used the motion - equation isomorphism to study the expansion of an ideal - gas fluid into a periodic volume four times larger than the original .",
    "see * figure 4*. our goal was better to understand the entropy increase associated with the expansion process , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the ( equilibrium only ! ) entropy for the two - dimensional ideal gas is just @xmath15 .",
    "* figure 4 * shows five stages in the expansion process . at the top",
    "we see the particle locations .",
    "below are the density and the kinetic energy .",
    "the white regions are above average and the black below .",
    "three very significant points of interest were clarified by these simulations : [ 1 ] equilibrium occurs quickly , in a time on the order of a sound traversal time ; [ 2 ] the kinetic energy field , which contributes to the local energy and entropy , needs to be measured _ relative _ to the local stream velocity ; and [ 3 ] entropy _ must _ be evaluated using the local energy ( including the _ local _ fluctuating kinetic energy ) rather than the laboratory - frame energy .",
    "this last point becomes clear on looking at the time dependence of the two kinetic - energy calculations .",
    "entropy increase ( in isentropic expansions ) does nt occur until the gas contacts its periodic images and begins the dissipation of mass motion into heat .",
    "see * figure 5 * .",
    "the free expansion problem@xcite is particularly challenging for finite - element approaches due to its severe shear deformation and demonstrates the ability of spam to deal with interesting fluid mechanics problems .",
    "the simplicity of spam and its computer implementation make it an ideal teaching tool .",
    "another spam application is rayleigh - bnard convection@xcite .",
    "a fluid heated from below and subject to a gravitational field can exhibit several morphologies , depending upon the dimensionless rayleigh number .",
    "again we choose a two - dimensional ideal gas . here",
    "the system height is @xmath16 and the gravitational field strength is chosen consistent with constant density , @xmath17 .",
    "the top - to - bottom temperature difference @xmath18 is equal to the mean temperature . the rayleigh number is @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath3 are the kinematic viscosity and the thermal diffusivity . in oyeon",
    "kum s phd work he compared simulations with straightforward - but - tedious eulerian continuum mechanics to spam .",
    "see * figure 6 * for a two - roll solution which is stable at @xmath21 . at a higher value of the rayleigh number , 40000 , three different stationary solutions of the continuum equations occur@xcite .",
    "see * figure 7*.    though maximum entropy or minimum entropy production have been touted as useful concepts in defining stability these examples show that there is no meaningful way to distinguish the relative stability ( as in thermodynamic phase stability ) of the different roll patterns . as the rayleigh number",
    "is increased through 90,000 the rolls begin regular vertical `` harmonic '' oscillations . between 150,000 and 250,000",
    "there are two separate solutions of the motion equations , one regular and harmonic , the other chaotic .",
    "see * figure 8*. the harmonic solution transports heat a bit more efficiently than does its chaotic brother@xcite .      on the microscopic side our lyapunov spectra project with harald led us to dozens of studies of the effect of nonequilibrium conditions on the spectrum@xcite .",
    "`` color '' conductivity , where half the particles are accelerated to the right and the rest to the left , provided a particularly clear example@xcite .",
    "harald and bill pointed out the simple shift of the lyapunov spectrum in 1987@xcite .",
    "the lyapunov spectrum of instability exponents shifts to more negative values with the sum of all exponents equal to the rate at which entropy is extracted from the system by deterministic thermostat forces .",
    "similar results were obtained for a variety of shear flows and heat flows in systems with a variety of boundary conditions .    in _",
    "every _ case nonequilibrium steady states occupy zero - volume fractal attractors in phase space ( meaning that the total volume of the cells in phase space containing any given fraction of the measure goes to zero as the small - cell limit is approached ) .",
    "this fact demonstrates the extreme rarity of nonequilibrium states .",
    "the time reversibility of the motion equations shows that the dynamically unstable repellor is likewise of zero volume .",
    "the symmetry breaking revealed by these simulations shows that only those flows satisfying the second law of thermodynamics are observable@xcite .",
    "exactly the same mechanism for irreversibility from reversible motion equations can be seen in small systems .",
    "even a single harmonic oscillator , exposed to a variable temperature @xmath22 can generate a chaotic heat flow and concentrate its stationary distribution on a fractal strange attractor .",
    "the `` 0532 model '' , which bill mentioned@xcite , incorporates `` weak '' control of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and provides an ergodic canonical distribution for the harmonic oscillator , enforced by a single thermostat variable @xmath25 : @xmath26 \\ ; \\",
    "\\dot \\zeta = 0.05 [ \\",
    "( p^2/t ) - 1 \\ ] + 0.32 [ \\ ( p^4/t^2 ) - 3(p^2/t ) \\ ] \\ .\\ ] ] bill showed the stationary phase - space cross section for @xmath27 . here",
    "* figure 9 * shows the flux through the @xmath28 phase - space plane for both the equilibrium flow and a nonequilibrium @xmath29 flow .",
    "the fractal character of the nonequilibrium section is clear .",
    "notice also the symmetry breaking .",
    "time reversal breaks the symmetry of the local lyapunov exponent ( indicated by color ) as well as the mirror symmetry present at equilibrium but absent at nonequilibrium . in the nonequilibrium case the phase flow is _ from _ a repellor identical to the attractor except for the signs of @xmath30 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is also the case that the rate of entropy production for the thermostated oscillator is equal to the rate of shrinkage of the phase volume @xmath31 : @xmath32 \\ ; \\",
    "( \\dot \\otimes/\\otimes ) = -\\zeta [ \\ 0.05 + 0.96(p^2/t ) \\ ] \\ ] ] this is because the time average @xmath33 implies that @xmath34 + 0.32\\zeta [ \\ ( p^4/t^2 ) - 3(p^2/t ) \\ ]   \\rangle = 0 \\ , \\ ] ] or @xmath35 \\",
    "\\rangle   = \\langle \\ \\zeta [ \\ 0.05 + 0.96(p^2/t ) \\ ] \\ \\rangle \\ , \\ ] ] so that the entropy production measured by the external thermostat is , when time averaged , precisely equal to the loss rate of gibbs entropy in the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "liouville s theorem turned out to be the most useful tool in understanding these ideas@xcite . this flow equation for thermostated systems",
    "describes the phase - volume loss in terms of the friction coefficients imposing nonequilibrium constraints and in terms of the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "stationary flows satisfying the second law of thermodynamics correspond to strange attractors , with shrinking phase volume .",
    "flows violating the law are both hard to find ( in the sense that they occupy zero phase volume ) and dynamically unstable ( in the sense that they have a positive unstable lyapunov sum ) providing a mechanical analog for the second law of thermodynamics directly from a determinstic time - reversible mechanics .",
    "let us look at one particular manybody case , the @xmath36 model , which is both simple and profound .",
    "aoki and kusnezov emphasized the utility of the @xmath36 model for statistical mechanics and explored its chaos and heat conductivity .",
    "it is a model of simplicity@xcite .",
    "nearest - neighbor particles are joined by hookes - law springs .",
    "each particle is also tethered to its lattice site with a quartic tether .",
    "the @xmath36 model hamiltonian has kinetic , tether , and harmonic contributions : @xmath37 + \\sum_{i < j } ( q_{ij}^2/2 ) \\ .\\ ] ]    at low temperature there is no heat conductivity as energy can travel through a harmonic chain at the speed of sound . at high temperature",
    "there is no heat conductivity because the chain behaves as a system of independent quartic oscillators .",
    "but it turns out that the useful range of energies where the chain exhibits fourier conductivity extends over about nine useful orders of magnitude in between !    in 2002 harald and bill studied the family of two - dimensional @xmath36 crystals ranging in size from @xmath38 to @xmath39 with boundary temperatures of 0.001 and 0.009 .",
    "a fit to the data established that the dimensionality loss approaches 43 in the large - system limit while the phase space coordinates associated with thermostating are 5 for each thermostated particle@xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional case is more dramatic . in our most recent book we provided two more examples of largescale dimensionality loss using temperatures of 0.003 and 0.027 .",
    "we found that the dimensionality of a 24-particle attractor in its 50-dimensional phase space was about 15 .",
    "see * figure 10 * .",
    "a 36-particle attractor in its 74-dimensional phase space had an attractor dimensionality of about 30 . by 2005",
    "we had a good understanding of many such simple models that illustrated the correspondence between microscopic fractal lyapunov - unstable systems and phenomenological macroscopic fluid mechanics .",
    "bill spent much of my last `` work '' year in livermore ( 2005 ) building us a new home in ruby valley just a couple of miles from the crest of the ruby mountains .",
    "ruby valley is a close - knit ranching community in northeastern nevada .",
    "the cows , mostly aberdeen angus , outnumber the people by orders of magnitude and the telephone `` book '' is a single page , distributed annually at christmas along with copies of a christmas card from each valley family .",
    "communication is vital to research . with airplanes and the internet",
    "we have continued our active research life in ruby valley .",
    "the cooperative and supportive nature of science is clear to us as we number our collaorators at well over 100 with at least that many more colleagues .",
    "heat flow , ergodicity , chaos , and shockwaves have been our main research activities in ruby valley , along with related trips to austria , australia , england , japan , mexico , poland , russia , and spain@xcite .",
    "one of our earliest findings in ruby valley illustrates a shortcoming of hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "it can not describe steady heat flow .",
    "we happened on this finding in 2007@xcite and revisited it in 2013@xcite in response to unjustified claims for a `` hamiltonian thermostat '' which turned out to be misleading and worthless .",
    "we have favored deterministic thermostating and the kinetic definition of temperature ever since bill ashurst s work in the early 1970s .",
    "we thought it would be instructive to compare heat transport with the simple nos - hoover thermostat to heat transport with straightforward hamiltonian thermostats .",
    "we considered three varieties of hamiltonian thermostats@xcite , nos s , which reproduces the entire canonical distribution , and two lagrange - multiplier approaches leading to hamiltonians which constrain the kinetic or the configurational temperatures of selected degrees of freedom .",
    "we found generally that _ hamiltonian mechanics is incompatible with heat flow_. if a cold thermostat extracts heat while a hot thermostat provides it , both at the same rate @xmath40 the system s steady - state entropy change is _ negative _ ! :",
    "@xmath41 here @xmath42 is the ( time - averaged ) rate at which heat flows both in and out of the system . gibbs",
    "relation linking entropy to phase volume @xmath43 suggests that any steady heat flow implies a loss of phase volume and is incompatible with liouville s theorem .",
    "so the question is : what actually happens if the two heat reservoirs are modelled by hamiltonian mechanics ? to find out we tried connecting several types of hamiltonian thermostats to a newtonian system in a sandwich fashion .",
    "the thermostats considered included : [ 1 ] nos s original hamiltonian@xcite , [ 2 ] the `` hoover - leete '' hamiltonian@xcite which constrains the kinetic energy to a fixed constant : @xmath44 and [ 3 ] a hamiltonian which constrains the configurational temperature to a fixed constant .",
    "the configurational temperature@xcite folows from an integration by parts in the canonical ensemble : @xmath45    an extremely interesting thing happens when any one of these three hamiltonian thermostats is applied to the @xmath36 heat - transfer problem .",
    "_ there is no heat flow _",
    "! * figure 11 * illustrates a typical case , with the thermostated kinetic temperature in the hot and cold regions having the specified cold and hot values but with no current at all flowing through the newtonian regions separating the two reservoirs .",
    "these problems make the point that any _",
    "non_equilibrium simulation of heat flow with molecular dynamics is necessarily intrinsically _",
    "this conclusion is surprising , as was also the fractal nature of nonequilibrium distribution functions which came to light some thirty years ago in low - dimensional simulations of nonequilibrium transport in phase spaces of three or four space dimensions .",

    "mechanical and thermal variables ( bottom ) for a one - dimensional shockwave using the triangular - lattice `` cold '' curve , an allocation of the work and heat to @xmath46 , and a tensor thermal conductivity with a thermal relaxation time of 3 . for details see reference 27 .",
    ", width=432 ]    bill s early work on shockwaves was published in the fall of 1967 in a summary of work at the livermore laboratory presented by bill s group leader russ duff at a meeting on the `` behavior of dense media under high dynamic pressure '' in paris@xcite .",
    "ten years later klimenko and dremin published dynamical studies@xcite of two dense - fluid shockwaves for a model of argon .",
    "ten years after that brad holian and galen straub at los alamos collaborated with bill and bill moran to study a 400-kilobar shockwave in a model of argon , just below the pressure and temperature at which the fluid ionizes@xcite .",
    "thirty years later with paco uribe@xcite we carried out studies confronting a detailed model capable of matching the physical effects observed with molecular dynamics : [ 1 ] a large disparity between the longitudinal and transverse temperatures , [ 2 ] a time delay in the response of stress to strain and heat flux to a thermal gradient , and [ 3 ] a partition of heat and work into separate longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "these features are capable of describing the far - from - equilibrium states found in strong fluid shockwaves .    in correlating the results of molecular dynamics simulations with continuum models",
    "the smooth - particle averaging is invaluable . with spam averaging it was possible to establish the stability of planar shockwaves in two - dimensional systems as is shown in * figure 13*. throughout",
    "we have observed marked differences between the longitudinal and transverse temperatures as well as a time delay between the strain rate and the shear stress and between the temperature gradient(s ) and the heat flux .",
    "with paco uribe in mexico we were able to formulate and implement a detailed model capable of describing all of these effects .",
    "it is interesting that unless the delay time is brief , on the order of a collision time , the constitutive model becomes unstable .      in 2014 bill",
    "received an interesting paper to review for the journal of chemical physics@xcite .",
    "the authors , baidurya bhattacharya and his student puneet patra had the clever idea of thermostating both the kinetic and the configurational temperatures simultaneously .",
    "bill thought this was a fine idea and wrote to them that he enjoyed their paper and was looking forward to its publication .",
    "the rapid - fire emails that followed soon led to the appearance of baidurya in ruby valley for a visit , and then in 2015 to a visit with his family , which makes regular trips to the united states in the summers .",
    "this led to a very productive collaboration and friendship .",
    "we ll be traveling to kharagpur in december for some lectures at professor bhattacharya s institute , which we hope will turn out to be yet another book .",
    "this meeting led , though indirectly , to solving a problem that had puzzled bill for 30 years : how to thermostat an ergodic canonical harmonic oscillator with a single thermostat variable .",
    "the patra - bhattacharya idea led first to simultaneous weak control of coordinates and momenta and finally to weak control of two kinetic - energy moments .",
    "several specific examples proved ergodicity for the oscillator and the simple pendulum , but not ( so far ) for the quartic potential .",
    "this same work also led us into collaborations with clint sprott ( university of wisconsin - madison ) , a wonderful colleague who has furnished many stimulating ideas as well as his graphical expertise which is illustrated here in * figure 9*.      we are grateful to you all for your support , collaborations , friendship , and love over the years .",
    "thanks for your attention to our reminiscences .",
    "bill specially wants to thank berni alder for his participation here and for his extending a helping hand in so many ways that were crucial to the good life bill and carol have enjoyed so far .",
    "we urge those of you who are younger to reflect on your good fortune in being a part of our progress in understanding the world around us .",
