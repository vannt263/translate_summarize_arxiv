    "molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) is by far the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium , followed by carbon monoxide ( co ) with a significantly smaller amount .",
    "the symmetry of h@xmath0 results in the absence of a permanent dipole momentum , which makes the dominant interstellar molecule very difficult to detect .",
    "warm h@xmath0 gas can be observed in near ir emission , but the largest amount of h@xmath0 is located in cold gas , which is measurable in fuv absorption along individual lines of sight against bright uv background sources .",
    "thus the _ overall _ amount of h@xmath0 in the interstellar medium can not be measured directly .",
    "the amount of h@xmath0 often is estimated from the abundance of co , which can easily be determined from radio emission lines . for this method",
    "it is necessary to know the conversion factor @xmath7 between h@xmath0 column density and the velocity - integrated @xmath5co emission temperature , defined as @xmath8co@xmath9h@xmath10co@xmath11 ( e.g. heithausen & mebold 1989 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 factor has been determined for the milky way with some degree of accuracy , using various ( indirect ) methods ( bloemen et al . 1986 ) .",

    "an important new aspect for the knowledge of interstellar molecular gas in galaxies with chemical abundances different from those of the milky way is the determination of _ real _ abundance ratios of the h@xmath0 and co molecules via uv absorption spectroscopy .",
    "this is also the most elegant and safe way to decrease the uncertainties in the measurements of the @xmath7 factor in those systems .",
    "the _ copernicus _ satellite could measure the relation between h@xmath0 and co for the diffuse interstellar gas in the milky way ( federman et al .",
    "however , every individual h@xmath0/co ratio definitely is influenced by the metallicity , by the local radiation field and by the amount of dust in the observed complex .",
    "so far , h@xmath0/co ratios from absorption spectroscopy could not be measured outside the milky way .",
    "the sensitvity of _ copernicus _ was not high enough while the _ iue _ satellite as well as the _ hst _ do not cover the wavelength range below 1200  , where h@xmath0 is found in absorption .",
    "_ orfeus _ is the first instrument able to investigate the cold molecular gas in the magellanic clouds via absorption spectroscopy .    using _ orfeus _ data we measured h@xmath0 absorption profiles toward one lmc ( de boer et al .",

    "1992 ) in the association lh 10 in the lmc shows a column densitiy in h@xmath0 high enough to expect the presence of co. the _ orfeus _ spectrum of lh 10:3120 therefore provides the very first opportunity to determine a h@xmath0/co ratio for lmc gas directly .",

    "mission on the _ astro - spas _ space shuttle mission between november and december 1996 .",

    "the echelle spectrometer was designed to achieve a spectral resolution of @xmath12 in an entrance aperture of @xmath13 ( appenzeller et al .",

    "the strongest h@xmath0 lines are located in the range below 1000 . unfortunately , this is the part of the spectrum where the decreasing sensitivity of the instrument as well as the increasing uv extinction leads to extremely low countrates , so that we had to exclude this wavlength range from the further analysis .",
    "another problem is that the large number of transitions in combination with the expected complex line - of - sight structure let most of the h@xmath0 lines overlap with other h@xmath0 absorption components .",
    "in addition , many atomic transitions , as compiled by morton ( 1991 ) , contribute to the confused absorption structure in some parts of the spectrum .",
    "the low s / n ratio does not allow multi - component fits for the absorption features so that decompositions were not possible . despite these restrictions we found 16 h@xmath0 absorption lines at @xmath87 kms@xmath15 from the lowest 5 rotational states , essentially free of lineblends in the velocity range between @xmath88 and @xmath89 kms@xmath15 , for which an analysis of line strengths was possible .",

    "would not lead to a higher accuracy .",
    "we measured the equivalent width of each line 3 times independently and used the mean value for the further evaluation .",
    "the formal uncertainties in the equivalent widths are basically due to photon statistics and due to the error for the choice of the continuum .",
    "the low count rate and the resulting low s / n ratio causes uncertainties in the determination of the continuum level as well as in the analysis of the line strengths themself .",
    "however , the choice of the continuum is in particular critical for weaker absorption structures , but our selection contains basically strong absorption lines .",
    "we determined the uncertainty for each line using the following procedure : we fitted ( by eye ) the continuum around the absorption line and ( when necessary ) normalized the continuum level .",
    "we fitted a maximum and a minimum continuum in order to give an upper and a lower limit for its uncertainty , including the error range for the background substraction .",
    "in addition , we obtained the formal uncertainties in the equivalent widths ( for a fixed continuum ) using the algorithm of jenkins et al .",
    "the total uncertainty for the equivalent width measurements then was calculated by taking both contributions into account . on the average ,",
    "the two error sources contribute approximately equal to the total uncertainty .",
    "all h@xmath0 equivalent widths and their errors have been compiled in table 2 .",
    "examples for absorption line profiles can be found in paperi .      for the further investigation the equivalent widths were used for a standard curve - of - growth analysis for the lmc gas .",
    "we find that the best fit for the curve of growth has a @xmath21-value of @xmath92 kms@xmath15 ( see paper i ) .",
    "for the lower rotational states the @xmath21-value is not critical , since their lines are strong and located near the damping part of the curve of growth . only for @xmath93 a different @xmath21-value would lead to a significant change in the column density for this state .",

    "we then determined a mean deviation to the best fit of @xmath94 , as given in table 2 .",
    "summing over all @xmath94 , we find a total h@xmath0 column density of @xmath4(h@xmath98 @xmath3 .",
    "the empirical curve of growth for all states is shown in fig.2 of paperi .",
    "the determination and interpretation of the rotational excitation of the h@xmath0 gas has been described in paperi .",

    "we investigated the amount of carbon monoxide ( co ) in the _ orfeus _ spectrum of lh 10:3120 by looking for absorption in the strongest of the @xmath5co absorption bands , the c - x band near 1088  .",
    "other co bands in the wavelength range of _ orfeus _ , such as the e - x band near 1076  , show blendings at lmc velocities or are too weak in comparison to the c - x band .",
    "we used wavelengths and oscillator strengths for the co transitions from the list of morton & noreau ( 1994 ) .",
    "fig1 shows the spectral region of the c - x r(0 ) , 0 - 0 transition . due to the low s / n ratio and due to a probable blending from cli at 1088.06   the absorption structure looks rather complex .",
    "moreover , the h@xmath0 p(4 ) , 2 - 0 line with its galactic component at 1088.79   overlaps the co absorption in the plotted region , as indicated in fig.1 .",
    "galactic co absorption near @xmath103 kms@xmath15 is present kms@xmath15 in fig.1 doubtless is due to galactic co absorption , too .",
    "the analysis of the molecular absorption lines related to milky way gas will be presented elsewhere ] but there is definitely no absorption visible at @xmath104 kms@xmath15 , where the molecular hydrogen in the lmc gas has its absorption ( see fig.1 ) and where possible co absorption from lmc gas should be visible .",
    "obviously , the amount of co in the lmc gas is to small to be detectable in the _ orfeus _ spectrum of lh10:3120 . because of the low count rate noise peaks have equivalent widths comparable with those of real absorption lines .",
    "typical noise features are visible near @xmath105 and @xmath106 kms@xmath15 .    in the following ,",
    "we derive an upper limit for the @xmath5co column density by estimating the detection limit for the c - x band .",

    "orfeus_. for a rotational temperature of @xmath1105 k for the co molecules ( as typically found in molecular gas in the milky way ) , the two lowest rotational states ( @xmath99 ) are approximately equally populated ( morton & noreau 1994 ) . under this assumption",
    "we can sum over the individual oscillator strengths @xmath30 of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 and find a total value of @xmath111 .",
    "based on the noise present and the resulting continuum uncertainty , we place a detection limit of @xmath112 m in the _ orfeus _ spectrum near 1088  using the procedure described in sect.2.4 .",
    "this value fits well with the actual upper limit of the strength of a noise peak , as measured in the selected wavelength range . in fig.1 a @xmath39",
    "m strong absorption structure at @xmath104 kms@xmath15 is shown as illustration .",
    "we find an upper limit for the co column density in the lmc gas of @xmath1co@xmath2 @xmath3 based on the @xmath39 m detection limit and the curve of growth with @xmath113 kms@xmath15 .",
    "this value is valid under the assumption that the h@xmath0 and the co are located in the same clouds . in that case , the upper limit in @xmath1co@xmath11 for each cloud scales downward linearly with @xmath31 provided that the used @xmath21-value is scaled down by the same factor .",
    "for multiple identical clouds the limit for @xmath1co@xmath114 would be the same as the one derived above .",
    "there are no accurate 21 cm data available for the sight - line to lh 10:3120 , but the hi column density in this direction can be determined by fitting the damping wings of the strong ly@xmath115 absorption line in the _ orfeus _ spectrum .",
    "obviously , the ly@xmath115 line ( fig.2 ) is blended by the stellar nv line near 1240   and by some strong interstellar absorption lines near 1190   ( e.g. siii ) .",
    "in addition , the noise also disturbs the shape of the profile .",
    "no pcygni profile is visible for the stellar nv , as seen in spectra of other early type stars . since the right wing of the ly@xmath115 absorption is completely blended by the stellar nv line , we fit the left wing of ly@xmath115 with a theoretical voigt profile , using oscillator strengths and damping parameters from the list of morton ( 1991 ) .    the hi absorption from galactic foreground gas in direction to the lmc",
    "is known to be @xmath116 @xmath3 ( mcgee et al .",
    "1983 ) . moreover , from the galactic sii abundance in our spectrum ( @xmath4(sii)@xmath117 @xmath3 ) in combination with the known ratio [ sii / h]@xmath118 dex ( de boer et al .",

    "we find the best agreement with a hi column density of @xmath4(hi)@xmath120 @xmath3 for the lmc gas , as shown in fig.2 ( solid line ) . the uncertainty in this value is basically determined by the range of possible profile fits and not so much due to the uncertainty in the galactic foreground absorption .",
    "varying the hi column density for the lmc component we find a reasonable agreement for profile fits in a range between @xmath121 and 3.0 @xmath122 @xmath3 , in fig.2 shown as dashed lines .",
    "for the determination of the gas - to - dust ratio as well as for the investigation of the relation between dust and molecular hydrogen the colour excess @xmath19 _ within _ the lmc has to be estimated .",
    "parker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) give a minimum value of @xmath123 for the total reddening towards lh 10:3120 .",
    "if we assume his value of @xmath124 as the galactic foreground reddening , 0.12 mag remains for the colour excess within the lmc .",
    "however , the galactic foreground reddening shows variations over the field of the lmc ( bessel 1990 ) of the order of @xmath125 , so that the colour excess in the lmc toward lh 10:3120 is uncertain to the same degree .    one may consider that the selective extinction @xmath126 in the lmc is different from that in the galaxy .",

    "the co observations toward lh 10:3120 have been carried out in july 1997 using the 15-m swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( _ sest _ ) at la silla , chile . a sis receiver at @xmath29 = 3 mm range was employed which yielded overall system temperatures , including sky noise , of order @xmath131k on a main beam brightness temperature ( @xmath132 ) scale .",

    "all spectral intensities were converted to a @xmath132 scale , correcting for a main beam efficiency of 0.68 at 115 ghz .",

    "the amount of co increases to the north , where the ( geometrical ) centre of the young association lh 10 is located .",

    "we find a brightness temperature of @xmath137 k. the velocity shift between co emission and h@xmath0 absorption as well as the lack of co absorption at lmc velocities implies that the co emission near @xmath136 kms@xmath15 most likely comes from gas _ behind _ lh 10:3120 .",
    "sest _ data therefore can not be used to compare the co emission in the direction toward lh 10:3120 with the h@xmath0 column density along this line of sight .",

    "these results allow us to investigate the correlations between atomic gas , dust and molecules in the lmc .",

    "the hydrogen fraction in molecular form in the lmc is only @xmath138h@xmath139hi@xmath140h@xmath141@xmath142 , lower than typical fractions for milky way gas with similar values in @xmath4(hi ) ( savage et al .",
    ". moreover , the upper limit for the co column density in comparison to @xmath4(hi ) is , with regard to results for the milky way ( federman et al . 1980 ) , relatively low as well .",
    "in contrast , the lower limit of @xmath4(h@xmath0)/@xmath4(co ) is @xmath143 and thus not substantially different from ratios measured in the galaxy .",
    "the excitation temperatures for the h@xmath0 are 50 k for @xmath144 and 470 k for @xmath145 ( paperi ) and do not indicate an abnormally strong uv radiation field in the lmc gas towards lh 10:3120 .",
    "a strong uv flux would decrease the molecular gas fraction through enhanced dissociation .",
    "we thus conclude that the diffuse lmc gas in the line of sight to lh10:3120 initially has a lower molecule content than comparable gas in the milky way .",
    "recently , low molecule fractions for lmc gas also have been proposed by gunderson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for two other lines of sight to the lmc , using spectra at low dispersion from the _ hut _ telescope .",

    "1977 ; federman et al .",
    "clayton & martin ( 1985 ) suggested that the ratio of @xmath4(cno ) to @xmath19 might be the same in the milky way and in the lmc , implying that the amount of dust and the abundance of gaseous cno elements are decreased in the same degree .",
    "does the lower dust content in the lmc ( and smc ) also limit the amount of molecular hydrogen , at least in the diffuse ism ?    yet , the number of relevant observations is too low to draw meaningful conclusions about the molecular content in the overall diffuse ism of the magellanic clouds .",
    "nevertheless , all measurements made so far and discussed here support the scenario , in which the amount of h@xmath0 in the diffuse ism of the magellanic clouds is limited by the lower dust abundance .",
    "clearly , the lower metallicity of the magellanic clouds leads to a smaller dust amount as well as to a reduced abundance of co , so that the lower dust content probably allows ( in the mean ) less h@xmath0 to form . through the deficiency of dust the shielding from the uv radiation is reduced , too .",
    "therefore , the total abundance of h@xmath0 in the diffuse ism compared to the amount of neutral hydrogen is probably lower than in the milky way . the intrinsic ratio of h@xmath0 to co in the diffuse gas of a metal - poor galaxy like the magellanic clouds might not be different at all from the one in the milky way , since it is possible that the abundance of both h@xmath0 and co is reduced by a similar factor .    for the densest regions in the interstellar gas , the molecular clouds ,",
    "the h@xmath0/co ratio is an even more critical parameter , since we do not know how different the cloud sizes in h@xmath0 and co in a low metallicity environment really are .",

    "( 1998 ) argued that the lower abundances of carbon and oxygen in the magellanic clouds may result in signifcantly lower cloud sizes as observed in co emission compared to the size in molecular hydrogen .",

    "<S> it is found that most of the co emission comes from gas behind lh 10:3120 . </S>",
