    "in the hierarchical structure formation scenario in a cold dark matter universe , dark matter halos and their galaxies have grown and built up their mass by colliding and merging with ambient sub - halos and satellite galaxies ( e.g. , bullock & johnston 2005 ; chiba et al .",
    "furthermore , massive galaxies harbour central , massive black holes ( bhs ) , whose masses ( @xmath0 ) are correlated with the mass of the spheroidal component of the host galaxy ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "currently , the bh  bulge relation is observed down to @xmath0 of @xmath1 ( barth et al . 2005 ; xiao et al .",
    "one is therefore naturally led to believe that a massive bh also increases its mass after a galaxy collision by merging with the bh that was located at the center of a satellite galaxy , as presumed in semi - analytical calculations for the galaxy and bh evolution ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "there is , however , no clear observational evidence that the merging events between galaxies really lead to the merging of massive bhs .",
    "the central bh of a satellite galaxy likely wanders in the halo of its host galaxy after a galaxy merging event , before it finally sinks towards the center of the host galaxy due to the dynamical friction ( bellovary et al .",
    "namely , the massive bh is expected to be located far away from the galactic center .    there are some known implications for the bh growth associated with merging events .",
    "for instance , ngc6240 ( at @xmath2100mpc ) is an irregular starburst galaxy , indicative of a recent galaxy merging event , and harbours two massive bhs with a projected separation of 1kpc ( komossa et al .",
    "double or triple massive bhs in a colliding galaxy are now commonly found ( e.g. , koss et al . 2011 ) .",
    "moreover , eso24349 , an edge - on disk galaxy at a similar distance , shows a bright x - ray point source ( hyper - luminous x - ray source ) at a projected distance from the center of 3.5kpc ( farrell et al .",
    "2009 ) . a detailed x - ray spectral analysis revealed a @xmath3 bh ( godet et al .",
    "although this intermediate - mass bh candidate may have been the central bh of a satellite galaxy ( farrell et al .",
    "2012 ) , there is no clear evidence for a merging event in this galaxy . in the case of some massive binary bh candidates ( sudou et al .",
    "2003 ; boroson & lauer 2009 ) , their large distances make it difficult to detect merging signatures .    as a case study , we focus on the nearby galaxy m31 ( andromeda galaxy ) .",
    "its proximity to the galaxy , at a distance of 780kpc ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2003 ; @xmath44pc and @xmath514kpc ) , allows detailed investigations into the faint stellar structures , showing that m31 is evidently in the process of the galaxy collision ( ibata et al .",
    "2001 ; irwin et al . 2005 ; fardal et al . 2007",
    "; mori & rich 2008 ) .",
    "thus , it is a unique laboratory to examine how galaxy evolution and bh growth take place .",
    "another advantage is the detectability : m31 s proximity is essential in order to detect the faint a low - luminous emission of a wandering bh .",
    "some stellar substructures in the m31 halo were shown to be remnants of a minor merger about @xmath6 gyr ago . in a previous paper ( miki et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter paper i ) , we established the probable position of the associated wandering massive bh by performing @xmath7-body simulations . finding this bh will provide us with clues to understand the coevolution of galaxies and massive bhs .",
    "if we really discover a massive bh wandering in a galactic halo , it indicates that many such wandering bhs , the remnants of satellite galaxies , in distant galaxies are missing due solely to sensitivity limits of current instruments . since all massive bhs so far have been found at the center of each galaxy , it opens up the possibility for the discovery of a new population of massive bhs .    in this letter",
    ", we determine the most efficient waveband(s ) to detect a wandering massive bh of the satellite galaxy in the m31 halo . in the next section ,",
    "the basic properties of the satellite galaxy and its central bh are briefly described .",
    "then , we present the expected emission from the wandering bh and from an assembly of stars bound by the bh . we conclude with a summary and discussion of this study in   4 .",
    "we briefly summarize the basic properties of the satellite galaxy that is interacting with m31 .",
    "as the satellite dwarf galaxy falls toward m31 , it is elongated by the tidal force from m31 , and eventually destroyed following a series of pericentric passages .",
    "now , we see only the remnants of the satellite galaxy as a stellar stream ( the so - called andromeda stream ) and two ( western and northeastern ) stellar shells ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "2001 ; irwin et al .",
    "detailed comparisons between observations and numerical simulations of the morphologies and the radial velocities of the stream and shells constrain the orbit , the mass and the concentration parameter of the satellite galaxy ( fardal et al . 2007 ;",
    "mori & rich 2008 ; paper i ) .    via the metallicity",
    " mass relation of dwarf galaxies , the lower limit on the stellar mass of the progenitor is known to be @xmath8 ( e.g. , mori & rich 2008 ) .",
    "an upper limit on the dynamical mass of the progenitor ( @xmath9 ) comes from the disk thickness of m31 ( mori & rich 2008 ) .",
    "the bh - bulge mass relation suggests that the progenitor dwarf galaxy has a massive bh with @xmath10 of about @xmath11 of the mass of its host spheroidal component ( magorrian et al . 1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "this raises the question of whether the colliding satellite galaxy did indeed have a central bh .",
    "font et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated the luminosity of the colliding galaxy to be @xmath12mag ( @xmath13 ) . adopting the @xmath14@xmath15 colors of elliptical and spiral galaxies ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) , this corresponds to @xmath16 of @xmath17 and @xmath18mag , respectively .",
    "galaxies around the current low - mass end in the bh - bulge mass relation are of similar or even fainter luminosities : for example , pox52 , a galaxy harboring a @xmath19 bh , has a dwarf elliptical morphology with @xmath20mag ( thornton et al .",
    "host galaxies of @xmath21 bhs have @xmath22mag ( jiang et al . 2011 ) .",
    "thus , we suspect that the colliding satellite galaxy had a massive bh at its center with @xmath10 of ( at most ) about @xmath23 ( i.e. , 1/500 of @xmath24 ) .",
    "we describe the @xmath10-dependency of the results later .",
    "if there was a central massive bh in the satellite galaxy , then where is the bh now ? based on the @xmath7-body simulations in paper i , which involved an intensive survey of parameters relevant to the collision followed up by high - resolution calculations , we identified five orbit models that reproduce the stream and the two shells well .",
    "the current position of the bh is then constrained to a small region ( @xmath25 ) in the eastern outskirts of the m31 disk .",
    "the expected proper motion is 3343@xmath26-arcsecyr@xmath27 .",
    "the distance of the bh from the centre of m31 is 1849kpc , with a projected distance on the sky plane of 0.40.8deg .",
    "we now focus on the emission from the wandering massive bh and trailing stars .",
    "first , we estimate the accretion rate onto the wandering massive bh .",
    "such a bh , moving with velocity of @xmath28 , will capture the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) of density @xmath29 and sound speed @xmath30 via hoyle - lyttleton - bondi accretion at a rate @xmath31 ( hoyle & lyttleton 1939 ; bondi & hoyle 1944 ) : @xmath32 we assume that the ism has the same density profile as the mass profile of m31 , namely , a hernquist bulge , an exponential disk and an nfw halo ( e.g. , fardal et al .",
    "a constant gas fraction ( with respect to the total mass of dark matter@xmath33star@xmath33gas ) of 0.1 is adopted .",
    "for the sound speed , we assume an ism temperature of @xmath34k for the disk and bulge gas , and of @xmath35k for the halo gas .",
    "the upper three panels of figure  [ fig : mdot ] show the hoyle - lyttleton radius @xmath36 [ @xmath37 , the free - fall timescale at that radius ( @xmath38 ) , and @xmath31 . among the five orbit models that reproduce the stellar structures of m31 ,",
    "the representative three cases ( with id1 , 2 and 3 ) are drawn in all the panels for a bh mass of @xmath39 .",
    "since the remaining two cases ( id4 and 5 ) show time variations similar to id1 , their results are drawn only in the third panel by thin solid lines . to take into account different bh masses , each curve can be scaled as , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the time coordinate is shown with respect to the present time , so that negative values mean the past , and vice versa .    around the pericenters ( e.g. , at @xmath43 and @xmath44myr for id1 ) , @xmath36 decreases due to the large bh velocity , whereas it has maxima around the apocenters ( at @xmath45 and @xmath46myr for id1 ) .",
    "there are two types of peaks in the time variation of @xmath31 . at the pericenters ,",
    "the high values of @xmath31 are due to the high ism density near the m31 center , lasting only a relatively short time because of the large bh velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "broad peaks in @xmath31 around the apocenters are caused by small bh velocities .",
    "to be precise , the estimated @xmath31 is the mass capturing rate , which does not necessarily equal the mass accretion rate onto the bh .",
    "we now evaluate the outer radius of the accretion disk / flow , which is determined by the angular momentum of the captured ism . at the apocenter , @xmath36 is largest at about 10pc , i.e. , 10@xmath47 schwarzshild radii ( @xmath48 ) for a @xmath23 bh .",
    "the ism kinematics is mostly isotropic , but has a tiny anisotropy which forms the accretion disk .",
    "the ism captured at that distance from the bh will have a specific angular momentum of about 5kms@xmath27pc ( phillips 1999 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the keplerian angular momentum at @xmath49 for a @xmath23 bh . due to the redistribution of the angular momentum within the flow ,",
    "the disk is a few times larger than the angular momentum barrier ( e.g. , machida et al .",
    "thus , we assume hereafter the size of the accretion flow to be @xmath50 . therefore , the accretion timescale within the flow ( @xmath2 the free - fall timescale from the outermost radius divided by the viscosity parameter ; narayan & yi 1995 ) is negligible compared with that from @xmath36 to the outermost radius of the flow .",
    "it follows that the time required for the captured gas to reach the bh is largely governed by the free - fall timescale at @xmath36 , which is @xmath51yr at most ( figure 1 ) , and is small compared to the orbital timescale of the wandering bh ( some @xmath52yrs ) .",
    "the expected @xmath31 is much smaller than the eddington rate ( @xmath53yr@xmath27 for a @xmath39 bh ) by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we , therefore , adopt an accretion model for such low rates , the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model . by imposing a radiative efficiency ( the conversion efficiency from the rest mass energy of the infalling gas to the emergent radiation ) of @xmath54 ( narayan & yi 1995 )",
    ", we calculate the bolometric luminosity as a function of time ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : mdot ] ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is a few tens of @xmath55 at the present time , and at most @xmath56 around the pericenters .",
    "based on the current value of @xmath31 shown in figure  [ fig : mdot ] , we present the expected broadband spectral energy distribution of the accretion flow in figure  [ fig : seds ] , using a simplified adaf model ( mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "since the five successful orbit models exhibit almost the same @xmath31 , we only show the case for id1 .",
    "below @xmath57hz , self - absorbed synchrotron emission emerges .",
    "the outermost radius ( @xmath58 ) contributes at @xmath59hz , while the innermost region at @xmath60 has a peak at @xmath57hz . above that frequency ,",
    "inverse compton scattering of the radio seed photons arises up to @xmath61 .",
    "bremsstrahlung emission appears at higher frequencies .    the detection limits ( 10@xmath62 in @xmath34sec integration ; based on , e.g. , perley et al .",
    "2011 for evla and the alma sensitivity calculator ) of various instruments for a point source are shown by solid and dotted lines in black .",
    "the size of the accretion flow is about @xmath63pc ( @xmath58 for a @xmath23 bh ) , corresponding to 0.3milli - arcsec .",
    "thus , the flow is practically a point source for those facilities .    because the emission from the bh is detectable only at frequencies less than @xmath64hz , radio observations with evla , alma and ska are crucial to find the wandering bh",
    "( see also strader et al .",
    "2012 ) . since the luminosity from the self - absorbed synchrotron emission scales as @xmath65 ( mahadevan 1997 ) , the minimum detectable bh mass @xmath66 for ska .",
    "if the accretion rate is much smaller than that in equation ( 1 ) by , e.g. , 2.5dex , as is suggested by perna et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and bower et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the minimum detectable bh mass increases to about @xmath67 .",
    "winds from stars surrounding the bh (  3.3 ) could increase the accretion rate and thereby the luminosity of the flow .",
    "radio flares , as seen in sgra@xmath68 ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2004 ) , will make the detection even easier .",
    "the radio source 37w207 ( walterbos et al . 1985 ) , located within our predicted region , may actually be the wandering bh .",
    "the wandering bh likely trails stars that resided in the central region of the satellite galaxy [ see oleary & loeb ( 2009 ) and merritt et al .  (",
    "2009 ) for star clusters surrounding recoiled bhs ] .",
    "the hill radius @xmath69 at the pericentric passage ( with the minimum distance @xmath70 between the satellite and the m31 centers of 1.1kpc ) determines how many stars are still bound to the bh .",
    "the m31 bulge ( with a mass @xmath71 of @xmath72 and a scale length @xmath73 of 0.6kpc ) will straggle stars outside @xmath69 from the bh via the tidal force , where @xmath74 the mass of stars in the satellite galaxy within this radius ( @xmath7518arcsec ) , if distributed in a king profile ( see paper i , for more details ) , amounts to about 10% of the bh mass of the satellite galaxy .",
    "if the presence of the central bh enhances the nuclear stellar density compared to that predicted by the king profile , the expected mass and luminosity of the star cluster will be higher , leading to an even easier detection .",
    "next , we utilize the stellar synthesis model pegase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) to calculate the spectra of an ensemble of stars for various ages after an instantaneous starburst ( their figure1 ) . in figure[fig : seds ] , we draw such spectra for a star cluster of @xmath76 in stellar mass and ages of 1gyr and 10gyr .",
    "the expected radiation is well above the 10@xmath62 sensitivities of near - infrared ( ir ) and optical , wide - field surveys , such as sdss , hypersuprime - cam and wish . in fact",
    ", the pandas project ( mackey et al . 2010 ) showed that there are several star clusters within the region miki et al .",
    "( paper i ) proposed for the possible location of the wandering bh .",
    "we propose that one of those clusters is the trailing star cluster that has survived against tidal destruction by m31 .",
    "such remnant star clusters are likely more metal - enriched than normal globular clusters [ as is expected for stars surrounding recoiled bhs ( merritt et al .  2009 ) ] , since they consist of stars born in the deep gravitational potential of the colliding galaxies . if one obtains an indication of metal richness via red color and/or spectral features / indices , then such star clusters are good candidates for remnant clusters with massive bhs inside .    as another example , at the position of hlx-1 of eso243 - 49 , there is a near - ir , optical and ultraviolet counterpart with a brightness typical of a massive globular cluster ( soria et al . 2010 ; farrell et al . 2012 ) .",
    "this may be another case of a bh wandering outside the galactic center and trailing a star cluster ( see also annibali et al . 2012 ; bekki & chiba 2004 ) .",
    "we have investigated the observational signatures of a massive bh and associated star cluster relic from a late stage of galactic merging in the nearby galaxy m31 .",
    "m31 likely experienced a merging event with a satellite galaxy about 1gyr ago , whose remnants are now observed as stellar sub - structures .    based on the expected position and velocity of the wandering bh that was originally at the center of the satellite galaxy , we have estimated the current gas accretion rate onto the bh via the hoyle - lyttleton - bondi formula .",
    "we then calculated the broadband spectrum using the estimated accretion rate adopting an adaf model .",
    "we find that the emission from the accretion flow is well above the sensitivities of the radio facilities currently operating ( evla and alma cycle 1 ) .",
    "once the full alma and the ska become operational , we will be able to probe the multi - waveband properties .",
    "as the spectral energy distributions of radio - loud , radio - quiet active galactic nuclei , and liners are very different from that of our target ( figure  [ fig : sed_other ] ) , we can discriminate such background sources from the accretion flow in other wavebands , including the ir , optical and x - ray .",
    "another potential approach to search for the wandering massive bh is to hunt for the stars that were in the central region of the satellite galaxy and are , thus , likely to be more metal - enriched than normal globular clusters .",
    "the stars trailed by the bh would be easily detected by near - ir and optical wide - field surveys .",
    "we propose that one of the star clusters found by the pandas project in the area we constrained for the position of the bh , is the star cluster accompanying the wandering bh .",
    "if we indeed detect such a wandering massive bh associated with the galaxy merging event , it will be an important contribution to exploring how the coevolution of bhs and galaxies proceeds .",
    "a discovery will imply a new population of bhs ; off - center massive bhs in galactic halos .",
    "recoiling bhs , kicked by the gravitational wave emission during a bh - bh merging event , will have a similar broadband spectral distribution and , thus , a similar radio detectability .",
    "moreover , such objects will enable us to image the accretion flow around a bh ( luminet 1979 ; fukue & yokoyama 1988 ) , which is practically very difficult for central bhs due to interstellar scattering in the centers of galaxies ( doeleman et al . 2001 ) .",
