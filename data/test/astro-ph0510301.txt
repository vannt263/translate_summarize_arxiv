    "the presence of a tight correlation between the rest - frame optical color and luminosity of early - type galaxies , the so - called color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) or red - sequence , is well established in the literature .",
    "the relation implies that the properties of the stellar populations in early - type galaxies are strongly dependent on the total stellar mass of the system . the tight correlation observed along this relationship ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) requires a strong coherence between both the age and metallicity of stellar populations present in early - type galaxies .",
    "measurements of the slope , zero - point , and dispersion around the color - magnitude relation probe the star formation histories of early - type galaxies and can provide physical insight into galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "one possible explanation for the slope of the cmr is that massive , and thus more luminous , galaxies retain more metals than less massive ones",
    ". the deeper potential wells of massive galaxies may allow fewer metals to be expelled in supernova driven winds @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have shown that the color - magnitude relation can be reproduced in hierarchical merging models if the epoch of mergers occurs at very early times . since the age of a stellar population is degenerate with its metallicity on the cmr , however",
    ", metallicity may not be the sole parameter behind the relationship @xcite . while both age and metallicity effects",
    "may create the cmr , studies of the evolution of the relationship toward high - redshift argue that the relation is driven primarily by metallicity and can not be generated by age effects alone @xcite .",
    "the color - magnitude relation of galaxies in clusters has been studied extensively . using high precision @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry , @xcite determined the dispersion around the cmr for early - type galaxies in coma and virgo to be small , @xmath4 milli - mag ( mmag ) .",
    "this small scatter implies early - type galaxies in clusters must be uniformly old with formation epochs earlier than a @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath6 mmag for clusters at @xmath7 ; this scatter , combined with the early age of the universe at the observed epoch , indicates that elliptical galaxies must have stopped forming stars in these clusters by a @xmath8 for a simple approximation to the color evolution of stellar populations .",
    "the cluster ms 1054 - 03 at a @xmath9 has a 29 mmag dispersion in the @xmath10 color @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite showed that the scatter in single clusters is only 40 and 30 mmag at @xmath11 .",
    "these small dispersions , seemingly independent of redshift , indicate that the coordination of star formation between galaxies in clusters is quite strong . using a sample of 158 clusters with @xmath12 drawn from the early data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    ", @xcite found that the cmr between clusters is very homogeneous .",
    "locally , the cmr is universal between clusters of various masses as well @xcite .",
    "while the mean color of red sequence galaxies in over - dense regions is only slightly redder than for similar galaxies in less dense regions and the slope of the cmr is independent of environment @xcite , several studies show that the scatter around the cmr is dependent on galaxy environment .",
    "a re - analysis of the data presented in @xcite indicates the dispersion around the cmr in clusters is 2-@xmath13 smaller than that for galaxies in groups or in the field @xcite . the scatter in galaxy colors in the core of the cluster cl 1358 + 62 at @xmath14",
    "have @xmath15 mmag while early - types at large radii ( @xmath16 mpc ) have nearly double that value , indicating that the dispersion of galaxy colors in the field may be larger than that measured in clusters @xcite .",
    "early - type galaxies in the hubble deep field have a scatter of 120 @xmath17 60 mmag in rest - frame @xmath18 with an average redshift of 0.9 @xcite . while this measurement is rather uncertain , it is larger than that measured in clusters , further indicating that field galaxies may have less coordinated star formation than galaxies in clusters .",
    "a majority of the work on the cmr has focused on early - type galaxies in clustered environments with luminosities near @xmath19 .",
    "this is natural , as statistically significant samples are more easily selected in these over - dense regions and @xmath19 galaxies are more common than their more massive analogs . in this work ,",
    "we extend the analysis of the color - magnitude relation to a sample of nearly 20,000 very luminous red field galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "these galaxies are not selected to reside in clustered environments and are chosen to be quite luminous with @xmath20 .",
    "we create two galaxy samples from the sdss spectroscopic data . at low - redshifts ( @xmath21 )",
    "we use galaxies from the entire survey region while at higher redshifts ( @xmath22 ) , where the galaxies are apparently fainter , we select galaxies from a 270 deg@xmath23 region which has been imaged an average of 10 times and up to 29 times",
    ". the repeated imaging of our moderate - redshift galaxies makes comparisons between the galaxy samples possible with similar fidelity .",
    "our sample allows us to probe a new area in parameter space  luminous galaxies in the field  and compare our results to those found for galaxies in clustered environments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the sloan digital sky survey and the selection for the galaxies used here . in  3 , we present our measurements of the slope and scatter of the color - magnitude relations .",
    "we discuss simple star formation history models in  4 and use our measurements of the scatter around the cmr as a constraint on the evolutionary history of massive early - type galaxies in the field . in  5 , we discuss the role environment plays on the cmr of galaxies .",
    "we construct the composite spectra of galaxies across the red sequence in  6 before closing in  7 . throughout this work ,",
    "we use @xmath24 = @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 and ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) = ( 0.3,0.7 ) to calculate luminosities and distances .",

    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite is imaging @xmath30 steradians of the northern sky through 5 passbands @xcite .",
    "the imaging is conducted with a ccd mosaic in drift - scanning mode @xcite on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope located at apache point observatory in new mexico .",
    "after the images are processed @xcite and calibrated @xcite , targets are selected for spectroscopy with two double - spectrographs mounted on the same telescope using an automated spectroscopic fiber assignment algorithm @xcite .",
    "two spectroscopic galaxy samples are created using the sdss imaging .",
    "the main galaxy sample @xcite is a complete , flux limited , sample of galaxies with @xmath31 .",
    "this cut is nearly five magnitudes brighter than the sdss detection limit of @xmath32 22.5 , and thus the photometric quantities for these galaxies are measured with signal - to - noise of a few hundred .",
    "the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample @xcite selects luminous early - type galaxies out to @xmath33 with @xmath34 19.5 using several color - magnitude cuts in @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the combination of these two samples allows us to study the broadband colors of luminous field galaxies at moderate - redshifts with statistically significant samples .",
    "while the focal point for the sdss is a contiguous survey of the northern galactic cap , the sdss also conducts a deep imaging survey , the sdss southern survey , by repeatedly imaging an area on the celestial equator in the southern galactic cap .",
    "currently , objects in the 270 deg@xmath23 region have been imaged an average of 10 times and up to 29 times , resulting in improved photometric precision for faint galaxies .",
    "objects detected in each observational epoch were matched using a tolerance of 0.5 arcseconds to create the final coadded catalog used here .",
    "the photometric measurements from each epoch were combined by converting the reported asinh magnitudes @xcite into flux and then calculating the mean value .",
    "errors on each parameter are simply the standard deviation of the flux measurements .",
    "the southern survey is an ideal region to compare the properties of faint galaxies at moderate - redshift with brighter low - redshift analogs drawn from the entire sdss survey area with photometry of similar fidelity .",
    "several methods are used to measure galaxy fluxes in sdss .",

    "the petrosian flux is given by the flux within a circular aperture of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the radius at which @xmath38 falls below 0.2 .",
    "in sdss , @xmath45 is determined in the @xmath36 band then subsequently used in each of the other bands .",
    "this flux measurement contains a constant fraction of a galaxy s light , independent of its size or distance , in the absence of seeing .",
    "more details of sdss petrosian magnitudes can be found in @xcite , and @xcite .    for each galaxy imaged by sdss ,",
    "two seeing - convolved models , a pure @xcite profile and a pure exponential profile , are fit to the galaxy image .",
    "the best - fit model in the @xmath36 band is used to measure the flux of a galaxy in each of the other bands .",
    "these model magnitudes are unbiased in the absence of color gradients and provide higher signal - to - noise ratio colors than petrosian colors .",
    "a more complete description of model magnitudes is given in @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we use petrosian magnitudes when calculating galaxy luminosities while model magnitudes are used to determine galaxy colors .",
    "we calculate photometric @xmath46-corrections using the method of @xcite ( ` kcorrect v3_2 ` ) .",
    "this program constructs a linear combination of carefully chosen spectral templates in order to best match the observed photometry at the measured redshift of the galaxy .",
    "the rest - frame colors of these best - fit spectra are used to derive corrections to the observed galaxy colors . with this method",
    ", it becomes simple to transform between bandpasses and , if necessary , photometric systems given a detailed understanding of the filter characteristics .",
    "after calculating @xmath46-corrections with ` kcorrect ` , we remove any mean @xmath46-corrected color versus redshift trends with a low order polynomial to account for the passive evolution of stellar populations between observed epochs .",
    "this evolutionary correction is normalized to a redshift of 0.3 , near the median of the lrg redshift distribution .",
    "the color evolution correction is small ( less than 2% for all bands in both samples ) and does not affect any of the results presented here .",
    "we further assume a galaxy dims by one magnitude per @xmath47 change in redshift in the @xmath35-band due to the passive evolution of its stellar populations .",

    "* ) tackles the problem in the field , these studies suffer from small numbers of galaxies .",
    "the measurement of the scatter around the cmr presented here , on the other hand , focuses on the most massive field galaxies at moderate redshifts using a statistically significant sample .",
    "we can now , for the first time , statistically compare the dispersion around the cmr in both clustered and field environments .    in order to explore the environmental dependence of the color - magnitude relation within our data set , we use sdss imaging of 5305 deg@xmath23 to identify a comparison sample of 16 million normal galaxies down to @xmath165 . at the location of each lrg galaxy in our sample , we count the number of neighboring galaxies within a @xmath166 mpc ( proper ) aperture which have colors similar to those expected for an @xmath19 galaxy on the red sequence , and luminosities in the @xmath167 to @xmath168 range ; the details of the luminosity and color cuts are given in @xcite .    using the number of neighbor galaxies as a proxy for the environment of each lrg in our sample , we divide each of our galaxy sets into a clustered subsample and a low density subsample .",
    "we define lrg galaxies with more than 5 ( 7 ) neighboring galaxies in the low- ( moderate- ) redshift samples to be in clustered environments while a field subsample is comprised of galaxies with fewer neighbors .",
    "this threshold was chosen such that the clustered sample in both redshift bins composes 30% of the total galaxy sample at that redshift . to place these values in physical context , at @xmath169 ( @xmath161 ) there are 25.3 ( 170 ) tracer galaxies per square degree . given the angular diameter distance of 398 ( 712 ) @xmath170 mpc to that redshift , this yields a total of 1.65 ( 3.46 ) background galaxies per aperture on average .",
    "the average number of neighbors in the field sample is 2.3 ( 3.9 ) galaxies while the clustered galaxies have a mean of 9.1 ( 11.4 ) neighbors .",
    "thus our clustered samples are over - dense by a factor of 4 ( 3 ) compared to the field galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the slope and zeropoint of the color - magnitude relation do not depend strongly on the local galaxy environment .",
    "we find the same result ; table 2 lists the measurements of the slope and zeropoint of the relationship for the ensemble sample as well as for the field and clustered subsamples .",
    "the variation between the two samples is small . in the following calculations ,",
    "we use the ensemble slope and zeropoint measurements as these are measured with the highest signal - to - noise .",
    "the results are unaffected if the individual measurements of the slope and zeropoint are used for each subsample .",
    "the fifth and sixth columns of table 3 list the measured scatter in galaxy colors for the field and clustered galaxies respectively . in all of the bands ,",
    "the scatter for the field subsample is larger than that in clustered environments .",
    "if we assume the scatter introduced by instrumental effects is the same for both the field and clustered subsamples , the same correction determined for the ensemble galaxy sample can be applied to these subsamples , as well . with this correction , we find that the scatter in galaxy colors in dense environments is @xmath171 smaller than for that of isolated systems in both redshift intervals studied here .",
    "our clustered galaxies reside in a range of densities , not simply rich clusters , as have often been used for similar studies , and thus we likely underestimate the significance of the difference in scatter between the field and strongly clustered environments .",
    "furthermore , our field sample is not completely composed of isolated galaxies as the average number of neighbor galaxies in this sample is larger than the average density of background galaxies .",
    "again , this leads to an underestimation of the true difference in the dispersion around the color - magnitude relation for field and clustered galaxies .",
    "the larger scatter in field galaxy colors supports previous claims of an environmental dependence for the scatter around the color - magnitude relation for early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the effect measured here is weak .",
    "comparisons of the scatter in galaxy colors for clustered galaxies often draw on galaxies from a single cluster whereas our clustered sample is created by combining galaxies from a number of clustered environments .",
    "it is possible that the star formation histories of galaxies in a single cluster are more highly coordinated than the star formation histories between different clusters , thus the scatter measured using galaxies from a single cluster would be smaller than when several clusters are combined . as the fraction of blue galaxies is larger in the field compared to clustered environments , the field subsample may have a larger contamination fraction compared the the clustered subsample .",
    "this would also cause an increased scatter in field galaxies colors compared to the galaxies in more dense environments .",
    "having measured the scatter in galaxy colors , we next investigate the spectral differences between galaxies by examining the average spectrum of massive early - type galaxies across the red sequence .",
    "the composite early - type galaxy spectrum has been investigated as a function of environment , luminosity , redshift , size , and velocity dispersions @xcite ; here , we construct the composite spectrum for red sequence galaxies of different mean colors .",
    "since the galaxies in our low - redshift sample are brighter , and thus have higher quality spectra , and are more numerous than the higher redshift galaxies , we only consider these galaxies in our analysis .    to construct the average spectrum of the galaxies in each color bin , we first shift the spectra according to the observed redshift and then normalize the observed sdss spectrum by the flux at rest - frame 5000 @xmath172 .",
    "we augment the sdss pixel mask to include all pixels within 10 @xmath172 of the bright sky lines at 5577 , 5890 , 5896 , 6300 , 6364 , 7245 , and 7283 @xmath172 .",
    "since the galaxies of interest are in the redshift range @xmath21 , the masked pixels occur at different rest - frame wavelengths for each galaxy , leaving the mean spectrum unaffected .",
    "we then find the number - weighted mean of the spectra , ignoring all masked pixels in the mean .",
    "galaxies are divided into two distinct color bins  red galaxies having @xmath71 colors between 1-@xmath13 and 3-@xmath13 redward of the mean and a blue sample in the same range blueward of the mean .",
    "the red galaxy bin contains 1321 galaxies with a mean @xmath71 color of 1.20 and @xmath173 while the blue sample contains 1161 galaxies with mean color and luminosity of 1.09 and @xmath174 .",
    "figure [ fig : coadd](a ) shows the coadded spectra of the red and blue galaxies .",
    "the gross properties of each composite spectrum are similar .",
    "figure [ fig : coadd](b ) shows the difference between the blue and red spectra .",
    "this difference spectrum shows clear signs of enhanced balmer absorption in the blue galaxies compared to the red composite , indicating that , on average , the blue galaxies contain more young stars , in agreement with past studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the red composite shows stronger [ n  @xmath175ii ] emission lines relative to the blue composite , no other prominent emission lines , such as [ o  @xmath175ii ] , [ o  @xmath175iii ] , and h@xmath153 are present ; this emission line difference is likely due to a larger fraction of agn in the red galaxies compared to the blue",
    "we consider two possible evolutionary scenarios to explain the spectral differences between the blue and red galaxies on the red sequence : pure age ( i.e. passive ) evolution of a single age stellar population and a recent epoch of star formation mixed with an existing old population . in the first scenario",
    ", we fit each composite spectrum with a solar metallicity , single age , stellar synthesis model created using the method of @xcite .",
    "the red and blue spectra are best fit by 6.3 gyr and 3.7 gyr populations , respectively . in the second scenario",
    ", we find the blue composite spectrum is well fit by a 6.3 gyr old stellar population mixed with a 1 gyr population containing 3.5% of the stellar mass and we model the red composite with a simple 6.3 gyr population",
    ". the difference spectra for both scenarios are shown in figure [ fig : coadd](b ) .",
    "while each of the two model hypotheses would suggest quite different evolutionary histories for massive early - type galaxies , the predicted difference spectra are remarkably similar .",
    "the model consisting of a recent burst of star formation slightly over - estimates the continuum in the difference spectrum near 3900 @xmath172 and thus provides a marginally poorer fit to the data than the passive evolution model .",
    "the residuals between the data and the model difference spectra are shown in figure [ fig : coadd](c ) .",
    "both of the models fail to match the strengths of the @xmath176 and mg @xmath177 features near 4140 and 5160 @xmath172 .",
    "@xcite interpret these differences between observations and synthetic spectra as a enhanced @xmath153-to - iron ratio present in the galaxies but not included in the synthetic models .",
    "also , several weak iron features are evident in the two model spectra near 4300 and 5300 @xmath172 which are missing in the observed difference spectrum . in a pure - age model for the evolution across the red sequence ,",
    "the enhanced blue continuum provided by the hotter stars in the young population dilutes the metal lines seen in the older population .",
    "this dilution leads to differences in the strengths of the metal lines of the two population models , thus causing the residual iron features in both model difference spectra .",
    "the absence of these residuals in our observed difference spectrum indicates that a pure - age model for the spectral differences between red and blue galaxies on the red sequence is an incomplete model . in order to match the variations of the spectral features across the red sequence ,",
    "a more detailed model is required .",
    "this model should include both age and metallicity variation and , more importantly , non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "until spectral synthesis models with realistic @xmath153-enhancement prescriptions are available , more quantitative analysis of our observed difference spectrum is difficult as the interplay between age , metallicity , and @xmath153-to - iron ratio variations must be included for a full understanding of the physical differences between these galaxies .",
    "another clear difference between the models and the data is the strong na d feature near 5892 @xmath172 . here",
    ", the red composite spectrum has considerably more na d absorption than predicted by the stellar synthesis models . as the model spectra do not contain absorption due to the interstellar medium",
    ", this discrepancy may indicate that the red galaxies contain more neutral gas than their blue counterparts .",
    "we present new multi - color observations of a large sample of galaxies in the range @xmath1 gathered from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "these galaxies represent the most massive galaxies in the universe and are not selected to be in clustered environments .",
    "past studies of the color - magnitude relationship have focused on @xmath178 galaxies in clusters , thus our work focuses on an area of parameter space previously unexplored .",
    "using the robust photometry of bright galaxies provided by the sdss as well as multiple observations of moderate - redshift galaxies , we are able to construct the color - magnitude relations for massive field galaxies in several colors . while our data only span one magnitude in luminosity , and thus are not ideal for in - depth analysis of the slope and zeropoint of the cmr , our large sample of galaxies allows us to measure the dispersion about this relationship quite well .",
    "the scatter around the red sequence is 20 mmag in the reddest bands while the bluest colors have nearly double this value .",
    "we construct several toy model star formation histories in order to place constraints on the evolutionary processes at work in massive galaxies .",
    "we find that the majority of star formation in these early - type galaxies must have occurred before @xmath179 , in agreement with other authors . for secondary bursts of star formation with strengths less than 5% of the total stellar mass of the system , our data are consistent with bursts of star formation at any epoch .",
    "however , one should note that none of the toy models reproduce the observed distribution of galaxy colors .",
    "furthermore , we make comparisons between our new measurement of the scatter around the color - magnitude relation for massive field galaxies and early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "an internal comparison shows that the scatter around the cmr in dense environments is @xmath180 smaller than that measured using more isolated galaxies .",
    "the composite spectra of lrg galaxies redward and blueward of the mean galaxy color are physically distinct .",
    "the blue galaxies show stronger balmer absorption than the red galaxies , consistent with the presence of a younger stellar population .",
    "simple models slightly favor passive evolution of stellar populations as the cause of the observed differences in spectra across the red sequence compared to a more recent injection of young stars onto an old stellar population , though the difference between the predicted spectra from these models is small .",
