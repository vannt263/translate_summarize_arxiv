    "from cosmic ray studies , there is a clear evidence that energies of primary cosmic rays extend up to enormous energies of more than @xmath0ev with highest energy cosmic rays detected by fly s eye ( hires ) collaboration @xcite , yakutsk air shower array @xcite and the agasa experiment @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "the highest energy cosmic rays represent still a _ terra incognita _ with respect to the processes powering them .",
    "the key question of modern astrophysics - namely , _ what is the nature of the cosmic high energy world ? _ - has to be considered as unsolved .",
    "there is no probe except for neutrino which could help us to answer this question .",
    "electrically charged protons and heavier nuclei , whose arrival direction is scrambled by galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields , are able to point back to the sources of their acceleration only above approximately 110eev  ev , 1tev@xmath1ev , 1pev@xmath2ev , 1eev@xmath3ev , 1zev@xmath4ev , correspondingly . ] .",
    "@xmath5-rays keep the initial direction but the universe is not transparent for them at energies above tev range since they annihilate into electron - positron pairs in an encounter with a 2.7k cosmic microwave background photons or with infra - red radiation .",
    "for example , @xmath5-quantum of 1pev energy can not reach us even from the galaxy center ( 10 kpc ) .",
    "neutrons are too short - live particles and they are not in time to cross even our galaxy before decaying if their energy is below several eev .",
    "thus , neutrino remains the only _",
    "i ) _ weak interacting ; _ ii ) _ stable ; and _ iii ) _ neutral probe which can reach the earth ( where we are able to observe it ) from the cosmological distances keeping original direction and pointing back to the source of its origin , meeting thus the basic requirements of _",
    "astronomy_.    mev - range neutrino astronomy have been existing for forty years with two neutrino sources identified so far , namely the sun and supernova sn-1987a , which at the moment remain the only two experimentally proved extraterrestrial neutrino sources .",
    "development of ultra- and extremely high energy  30tev30pev ; extremely high energy range ( ehe ) is @xmath630pev , respectively .",
    "] neutrino astronomy is under way , being still in its infancy .",
    "it started in 1960 with academician markov s suggestion to use a natural basins ( lakes or seas ) to deploy there a large volume neutrino telescopes @xcite .",
    "the large instrumented volume is needed due to the two basic reasons : firstly , expected fluxes of uhe / ehe neutrinos are very low and , secondly , cross section of neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) neutrino interactions @xmath7 ( by which neutrinos are supposed to be detected ) is small despite its increase with the neutrino energy . to detect neutrinos associated with highest energy cosmic rays one needs a kilometer scale detectors . after the first experimental steps at the middle of the 1970th ( the dumand project @xcite ) and detection of the first underwater atmospheric neutrino at the middle of the 1990th ( the baikal experiment @xcite ) experimental groups and collaborations moved to the next stage : creation of detectors with effective areas of 0.1 km@xmath8 and higher with an ultimate goal to build neutrino telescopes with effective volumes of one cubic kilometer .",
    "this talk reviews the physical goals and experimental status for ultra- and extremely high energy neutrino astronomy focusing , first of all , on operating and planned deep underwater / ice cherenkov neutrino telescopes .",
    "underwater / ice neutrino telescopes ( unts ) represent a 3-d arrays of photomultipliers deployed deep in the lake , ocean or in the polar ice at the depth of 1 to 4 kilometers to provide with a shield against the sun and moon light background and background of atmospheric muons .",
    "detection principle is based on registration of the cherenkov photons emitted by charged leptons ( including those emitted by secondaries produced along their way in the water or ice and by their decay products ) which are generated in cc neutrino interactions @xmath9 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : principle ] ) .",
    "also hadronic showers produced in nc neutrino interactions @xmath10 inside unt sensitive volume can be detected by radiated cherenkov photons .",
    "pmt hit times and positions provide with a possibility to reconstruct the track or shower vertex while a charge collected on pmt anodes allows to reconstruct the energy .",
    "thus , there can be two main event topologies in unts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : topo ] ) :    * * track event * in case of muon of any energy or tau - lepton with energy @xmath112pev ( approximately above this energy tau - lepton is able to propagate remarkable distance before decay thanks to the lorentz factor ) ; * * shower event * in case of electron , tau - lepton with energy @xmath122pev and nc interactions of all flavor neutrinos .",
    "however , real events may contain both topologies .",
    "track of uhe / ehe muon or tau - lepton is complemented by showers produced by secondaries which are generated in the muon interactions : bremsstrahlung , direct @xmath13-pair production , photonuclear interactions and knock - on electron production . with some probability",
    "these showers can take the major fraction of @xmath14/@xmath15 energy and even all the energy ( first of all due to bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "thus , a combined topology * track@xmath16shower * takes place . as well as",
    ", a tau - lepton track with a subsequent decay create such combined topology .",
    "cc muon neutrino ( or tau neutrino if @xmath17 is in multi - pev range or higher ) interaction within unt sensitive volume with an hadronic shower in the neutrino interaction vertex and subsequent charged lepton track also produces a combined topology which is even more complex in case of tau - lepton if it decays inside sensitive volume providing thus with at least two showers : in neutrino interaction point and at the decay point ( so called double bang @xcite ) . on the other hand , at energies below pev range two showers at the tau neutrino interaction vertex and at the tau - lepton decay point are so close to each other that can not be separated at reconstruction ( also tau - lepton track can not be distinguished ) and thus , such an event can be considered as a pure shower one .    the main goal of uhe / ehe neutrino astronomy is to determine the origin of high energy cosmic rays . for this",
    "it is needed to detect natural flux of the high energy neutrinos measuring neutrino energy , directional information and intensity . expected",
    "sources of uhe / ehe neutrinos are as follows ( more detailed review can be found , e.g. , in @xcite ) :    * steady sources like , e.g. , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , supernova remnants ( snr ) or microquasars ; * transient sources like gamma ray bursts ( gbr ) ; * decay of superheavy particles or topological defects .",
    "detection of uhe / ehe neutrinos and identification of their sources would allow to clarify the origination of uhe / ehe cosmic rays and to understand the processes by which the nature fills the universe with the highest energy particles .",
    "accuracy of energy measurements in unts is not too high .",
    "energy reconstruction is based on the increase of emitted cherenkov light due to muon ( @xmath15 ) catastrophic energy losses above @xmath181tev .",
    "also , amount of cherenkov photons produced by both hadronic and electromagnetic shower is more or less proportional to the shower energy .",
    "but due to stochastic nature of energy losses and due to the fact that an unt represent a non - dense detector with pmts spaced by typically 10 - 100 m , unts can not be a good calorimeter : for instance , dispersion of the @xmath19 distribution ( where @xmath20 is the true muon energy and @xmath21 is the reconstructed energy , respectively ) is around @xmath220.5 at @xmath235tev and @xmath220.3 for @xmath24100tev which means that the muon energy resolution is at the level of 2 - 3 only ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : enerres ] ) .",
    "besides , an additional un - avoided error at neutrino energy measurement comes from the fact that fraction of energy that is taken by charged lepton at neutrino cc interaction has a distribution and if neutrino interaction occurs far apart unt sensitive volume and , hence , shower energy can not be reconstructed , reconstructed charged lepton energy is not a good estimator for the neutrino energy .",
    "angular resolution for track events at uhe / ehe range is , typically , at @xmath250.1@xmath261.0@xmath26 level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angres ] ) and it is sufficient for search of point - like neutrino sources .",
    "the first main background for neutrino events comes from down - going atmospheric muons and it is suppressed by putting unt as deeper as possible to provide with a shield of water or ice ( each 1 km of water suppress the atmospheric muon background by approximately one order of magnitude ) and by selecting of up - going events as neutrino candidates . the second background is due to atmospheric neutrinos . the flux of astrophysical neutrinos is expected to behave like @xmath27 whereas the atmospheric neutrino spectrum falls like @xmath28 , yielding a better signal - to - background ratio at higher energies .",
    "thus , atmospheric neutrino background can be suppressed by setting the off - line energy threshold at the level @xmath2910 - 100tev .    except for deep underwater or ice neutrino detection other techniques",
    "are also discussed and used ( for more detailed review see @xcite ) :    * detection of coherent cherenkov radio waves emitted by electromagnetic showers @xcite ; * acoustic pulses generated in matter heated by uhe / ehe cascades due to ionization energy losses @xcite ; * detection of neutrino interactions by horizontal air showers ( both with traditional earth - based large extensive air shower arrays @xcite and with satellite space - based detectors @xcite ) .",
    "such kind of experiments have a high energy thresholds ( at eev energy range ) and are aimed to detection of highest energy neutrinos .",
    "target masses for neutrino interaction are at the level of giga - tons and higher providing with opportunity to detect weak neutrino fluxes .",
    "all the models for generation of uhe / ehe particles can be divided roughly by two main classes .    _ bottom - up _ models consider initially low energy particles which are accelerated up to uhe / ehe , typically , by shock waves propagating in accretion disks around black holes or along the extended jets emitted perpendicularly to the disk .",
    "neutrino are supposed to be produced in decays of mesons which are generated by interaction of accelerated particles with surrounding matter or photon fields .",
    "such models predict @xmath27 behavior of neutrino spectrum . by normalization of the neutrino flux to the known cosmic ray flux one can obtain an upper bound of @xmath30 gev@xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath31 sr@xmath31 ( waxman - bahcall limit @xcite ) to the neutrino flux integrated over all possible sources or _ diffuse _ neutrino flux ( fig .  [ fig : limit ] ) . more detailed consideration which involves , in particular , the source transparency , leads to bounds at the level between the waxman - bahcall limit and @xmath33 gev@xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath31 sr@xmath31 ( @xcite , mpr obscured and mpr transparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : limit ] ) .",
    "the last flux value more or less corresponds to the best experimental limits set by the moment on diffuse neutrino flux .    in so called _ top - down _",
    "scenarios particles are not accelerated but , instead , are born with high energies in decays of super - massive particles which generate uhe / ehe nucleons , @xmath5-rays and neutrinos .",
    "different predictions for neutrino fluxes generated in different sources ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) lead to expected flux at the earth at the level of @xmath25100 event yr@xmath31 km@xmath34 above @xmath3510tev .",
    "the neutrino telescope word map is shown in fig .  [ fig : map ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      the first project for deep underwater cherenkov neutrino detection , dumand ( eep nderwater uon and eutrino etector @xcite ) existed from about 1976 through 1995 .",
    "the goal was the construction of the detector , to be placed at 4800 m depth in the pacific ocean off keahole point on the big island of hawaii .",
    "many preliminary studies were carried out , from technology to ocean optics .",
    "a prototype vertical string of instruments suspended from a special ship was employed to demonstrate the technology , and measure the cosmic ray muon flux in the deep ocean .",
    "the dumand hardware was donated to the nestor project in greece ( sec .",
    "[ sec : nes ] ) , and may yet be employed there .",
    "although the dumand project was canceled in 1995 , it stimulated a lot the development of underwater technique for neutrino detection .",
