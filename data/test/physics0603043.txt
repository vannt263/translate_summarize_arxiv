    "unstable particles are a perfect testing ground for theories that try to unify the principle of relativity with quantum mechanics for ( at least ) two reasons .",
    "first , an unstable particle provides a very simple example of a non - trivial interacting quantum system . due to the specific initial condition characteristic to this problem ( there is just one particle in the initial state ) , a rigorous description of the decay is possible in a small hilbert space that contains only states of the particle and its decay products ,",
    "so the solution can be obtained in a closed form .",
    "second , unstable particles played an important role in confirming predictions of einstein s special relativity .",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally that the decay of moving particles slows down in a good agreement with einstein s time dilation formula @xcite .",
    "for a long time it was believed that relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory must reproduce exactly the einstein s time dilation formula for unstable particles @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed quantum relativistic calculation in @xcite has shown that there are small corrections to this formula in the case of particles with definite momentum .",
    "this result was later confirmed in other studies @xcite . although surprising , these findings did not challenge directly the applicability of special relativity to unstable systems .",
    "this is because relativistic transformations connect results of measurements of two inertial observers moving with constant velocities with respect to each other .",
    "then a fair comparison with the time dilation formula requires consideration of unstable states having definite values of velocity for both observers .",
    "such states do not have a definite momentum for , at least , one observer .",
    "their decay laws were considered in recent article @xcite which alleges that the decay accelerates when particle s velocity increases , instead of being slowed down as experiment shows . in the present article",
    "we resolve this controversy by performing a detailed calculation of the decay laws of particles with narrow distributions of velocities observed from moving reference frames .",
    "we found that the result of @xcite is based on an incorrect identification of the subspace of states of the unstable particle in the full hilbert space of the system . in sections [ ss : general ] - [ ss :",
    "instant ] we present a rigorous quantum relativistic framework required for the description of decays . the exact formula for the time dependence of the non - decay probability in a moving inertial frame of reference",
    "is derived in section [ sc : moving - frame ] .",
    "particular cases of this formula relevant to unstable particles with sharply defined momenta or velocities are considered in sections [ sc : mov ] and [ sc : general ] , respectively .",
    "section [ sc : numerical ] is devoted to numerical calculations of the differences between the accurate quantum mechanical result and the standard time dilation formula ( [ eq:1b ] ) .",
    "although these differences are much smaller than the resolution of modern experiments , their presence is in sharp contradiction with special relativity which does not tolerate even small deviations from the einstein s time dilation .",
    "the decay of unstable particles is described mathematically by the _ non - decay probability _ which has the following definition .",
    "suppose that we have a piece of radioactive material with n unstable nuclei prepared simultaneously at time @xmath0 and denote @xmath1 the number of nuclei that remain undecayed at time @xmath2 . then the non - decay probability indicates the rapidity of the observer that measures the non - decay probability , as described below . ]",
    "@xmath3 ( also called the _ non - decay law _ in this paper ) is defined as the fraction of nuclei that survived the decay in the limit of large @xmath4    @xmath5    so , at each time point the piece of radioactive material can be characterized by its _ composition _",
    "@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the share of undecayed nuclei in the sample and @xmath8 is the share of nuclei that were transformed to the _ decay products_. in this paper , in the spirit of quantum mechanics , we will treat @xmath4 unstable particles as an ensemble of identically prepared systems and consider @xmath3 as a property of a single particle ( nucleus ) , i.e. , the probability of finding this particle in the undecayed state .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with comparison of decay observations made by two observers @xmath9 and @xmath10 that move with respect to each other . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume that observer @xmath10 moves with respect to @xmath9 with velocity @xmath11 along the @xmath12-axis and that at time @xmath0 measured by both observer s clocks the origins of their coordinate systems coincide and all three pairs of coordinate axes are parallel ( @xmath13 , etc . ) .",
    "for discussion purposes we will say that @xmath9 is at rest while @xmath10 is moving .",
    "to simplify formulas we will use the _ rapidity _",
    "parameter @xmath14 instead of velocity @xmath15 .",
    "for example , in this notation the famous relativistic factor takes the form @xmath16 .",
    "if from the point of view of @xmath9 the decay is described by the function @xmath3 , then the non - decay law of the same particle seen by the moving observer @xmath10 will be denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "denotes time measured by the clock belonging to the observer @xmath10 .",
    "] calculation of this function and , in particular , the relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath3 is the major goal of this work .",
    "the purpose of any relativistic theory is to describe the relationships between measurements made by different _",
    "inertial observers _ or from different _ inertial reference frames _ , i.e. , reference frames moving in space with constant velocities along straight lines and without rotation .",
    "the special _ principle of relativity _ tells us that these reference frames are exactly equivalent    * * postulate i. * experiments identically arranged and performed in two different inertial reference frames @xmath9 and @xmath18 always yield the same results .",
    "for any two observers @xmath9 and @xmath18 there is an _ inertial transformation _ that connects @xmath18 to @xmath9 , i.e. , the set of rules that allows one to change from the reference frame @xmath9 to the reference frame @xmath18 . each inertial transformation is a combination of space and time translations , rotations and boosts .",
    "a composition of two inertial transformations is again a valid inertial transformation .",
    "this composition obeys the associativity law .",
    "the inverse of an inertial transformation is also an inertial transformation .",
    "therefore , they form a 10-parameter lie group . the structure of this group is specified in the second postulate    * * postulate ii .",
    "* inertial transformations ( space and time translations , rotations , and boosts ) form the _ poincar group_.    obviously , two different observers obtain different results by measuring observables of the same physical system .",
    "most problems in physics can be understood as translations of descriptions of the physical system between different reference frames .",
    "for example , if we have a full description of the system from the point of view of observer @xmath9 , then the time evolution is obtained by answering the question `` what is the description of the same system from the point of view of observer @xmath19 that is shifted in time with respect to @xmath9 ? ''",
    "it is important to realize that inertial transformations between observers can be divided into two groups : _ kinematical _ and _ dynamical_. kinematical transformations are those whose action on observables does not depend on the interaction .",
    "for example , if two stationary observers look at the unstable particle from different points in space , they would assign the same non - decay probability to the particle .",
    "the same is true for stationary observers having different orientations in space . from this",
    "follows , these forms are not appropriate for the description of non - decay laws of unstable particles . ]    * * postulate iii .",
    "* space translations and rotations are kinematical .",
    "on the other hand , time translations produce non - trivial changes in the system .",
    "the composition of the unstable system looks different for observers @xmath9 and @xmath19 shifted in time with respect to each other .",
    "the exact action of time translations on observables of the physical system should be obtained as a result of solution of dynamical equations which depend on the interaction acting in the system .",
    "hence the following postulate is true for all types of isolated interacting systems .",
    "* * postulate iv .",
    "* time translations are dynamical , i.e. , interaction - dependent .",
    "the above postulates i - iv have overwhelming experimental support .",
    "they are assumed to be valid throughout this paper .",
    "however they are not sufficient for a full description of the unstable particle in a moving reference frame .",
    "such a description requires also knowledge of the nature of boosts .",
    "here we have a choice between two paths forward .",
    "one path is to postulate certain properties of boosts .",
    "this path was taken by einstein .",
    "it leads to special relativity and to the time dilation formula ( [ eq:1b ] ) as explained in the next section . in this paper",
    "we will argue in favor of choosing another path : keep postulates i - iv , add to them well - established postulates of quantum mechanics , and see what are the implications for the transformations of observables ( in particular , the non - decay probability ) with respect to boosts .",
    "this approach is employed starting from section [ ss : general ] throughout the paper .",
    "in addition to postulates i - iv , einstein s special relativity makes two more assumptions regarding the nature of boosts    * * assumption v. * boosts are kinematical .    by postulating the kinematical character of boosts ,",
    "special relativity insists that the internal composition of a compound system does not depend on the velocity of the observer .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two observers moving with respect to each other , then , according to special relativity , both observer will measure the same composition of the unstable system at time @xmath0 .",
    "these statements are often considered as self - evident in discussions of special relativity .",
    "for example , r. polishchuk writes in @xcite _ `` any event that is `` seen '' in one inertial system is `` seen '' in all others .",
    "for example if observer in one system `` sees '' an explosion on a rocket then so do all other observers . '' _ in addition to the universality and interaction - independence of boost transformations , special relativity also postulates the exact transformation laws of physical observables with respect to boosts .",
    "they are referred to as _",
    "lorentz transformations_. the most fundamental are lorentz transformations for space - time coordinates of events .",
    "loses its localization from the point of view of the moving observer @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "so , assumption vi can be applied only in the classical limit . ]    * * assumption vi . *",
    "if from the point of view of observer @xmath9 an event is localized in a space point @xmath20 at time @xmath21 , then from the point of view of observer @xmath10 the same event has space - time coordinates @xmath22 given by lorentz formulas + @xmath23    let us now demonstrate that in special relativity the postulates i - iv and assumptions v - vi are sufficient to unambiguously describe particle decay in different reference frames without invoking any information about the interaction governing the decay .",
    "suppose that from the point of observer @xmath9 the unstable system is prepared in the state with composition @xmath24 at rest in the origin @xmath25 at time @xmath0 .",
    "then observer @xmath9 may associate the space - time point    @xmath26    with the event of preparation .",
    "in accordance with the dynamical character of time translations , the non - decay probability @xmath3 decreases with time . from experiment and quantum mechanical calculations ( see , e.g. , section [ sc : numerical ] ) it is known that the non - decay law has an ( almost ) exponential shape ) here . ]",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 is the _ lifetime _ of the unstable particle . at time",
    "@xmath29 the non - decay probability is exactly @xmath30 , so that the composition is @xmath31 .",
    "this `` one lifetime '' event has coordinates    @xmath32    according to the observer @xmath9 .",
    "let us now take the point of view of the moving observer @xmath10 .",
    "due to the assumption v , both @xmath9 and @xmath10 agree that at the `` preparation '' and `` lifetime '' events the non - decay probabilities are 1 and @xmath30 , respectively . however , observer @xmath10 may not agree with @xmath9 about the space - time coordinates of these events . substituting ( [ eq : event1 ] ) and ( [ eq : event2 ] ) in ( [ eq : lorentz - time ] ) - ( [ eq : lorentz - x ] ) we see that from the point of view of @xmath10 , the `` preparation '' event has coordinates @xmath33 , and the `` lifetime '' event has coordinates @xmath34 . therefore , the time elapsed between these two events is @xmath35 times longer than in the reference frame @xmath9 .",
    "this also means that the decay law of the particle is exactly @xmath35 slower from the point of view of the moving observer @xmath10 .",
    "this is reflected in the famous `` time dilation '' formula    @xmath36    this formula was confirmed in numerous experiments @xcite , most accurately for muons accelerated to relativistic speeds in a cyclotron @xcite .",
    "these experimental findings were certainly a triumph of einstein s theory .",
    "however , as we see from the above discussion , in special relativity eq .",
    "( [ eq:1b ] ) can be derived only under two assumptions v and vi , which lack proper justification .",
    "therefore , a question remains whether eq .",
    "( [ eq:1b ] ) is a fundamental exact result or simply an approximation that can be disproved by more accurate measurements ?",
    "our goal in the rest of this paper is to demonstrate that this classical result of special relativity is not exact . in section [ sc : numerical ]",
    "we will calculate corrections to the formula ( [ eq:1b ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the description of an isolated unstable system from the point of view of relativistic quantum theory . in our approach",
    "we will keep postulates i - iv .",
    "however , we are not going to use assumptions v and vi .",
    "we will consider a model theory with particles @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , so that particle @xmath37 is massive spinless and unstable , while its decay products @xmath38 and @xmath39 are stable and their masses satisfy the inequality    @xmath40    which makes the decay @xmath41 energetically possible . in order to simplify calculations and avoid being distracted by issues that are not relevant to the problem at hand we neglect the spin of the particle @xmath37 and assume that there is only one decay mode of this particle , i.e. , into two decay products @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for our discussion ,",
    "the nature of the particle @xmath37 is not that important .",
    "for example , this could be a muon or a radioactive nucleus or an atom in an excited state .",
    "when measuring the non - decay law , experimentalists simply count the number of particles and determine their types .",
    "for example , observations of a muon may result in only two outcomes .",
    "one can find either a non - decayed muon or its decay products ( an electron , a neutrino , and an antineutrino ) .",
    "thus the number of particles is a legitimate observable , and for our model system @xmath42 we can introduce hermitian operators for the number of particles @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . since these observables can be measured simultaneously , we can assume that these three operators commute with each other .",
    "two combinations of their common eigenvalues are allowed in our system :    @xmath46    hence the hilbert space of the unstable system should be represented as a direct sum of two orthogonal subspaces , and @xmath47 are allowed to take any values from zero to infinity",
    ". however , for most unstable particles the interaction between the decay products in the final state can be ignored , and considering the subspace ( [ eq : tensor - product ] ) of the full fock space is a reasonable approximation . ]",
    "@xmath48    where @xmath49 is the subspace of states of the unstable particle @xmath37 which corresponds to the set of eigenvalues ( [ eq : eigenval1 ] ) , and @xmath50 is the orthogonal subspace of the decay products which corresponds to the set of eigenvalues ( [ eq : eigenval2 ] ) .",
    "we can now introduce a hermitian operator @xmath51 ( also known as `` yes - no experiment '' ) that corresponds to the observable `` particle @xmath37 exists '' .",
    "the operator @xmath51 can be fully defined by its eigensubspaces and eigenvalues .",
    "when a measurement performed on the unstable system finds it in a state corresponding to the particle @xmath37 ( i.e. , the state vector is within @xmath52 ) , the value of @xmath51 is 1 . when the decay products @xmath53 are observed ( the state vector lies in @xmath54 ) , the value of @xmath51 is 0 .",

    "so , experimental observation of the predicted corrections requires significant improvements of existing experimental techniques .",
    "note that formulas ( [ eq : omega-0-t ] ) and ( [ eq:62 ] ) for the particle seen from the moving frame are approximate in the sense that they ignore the `` decay caused by boost '' expressed by eq .",
