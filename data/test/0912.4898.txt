    "two types of approaches are utilized in sciences to describe the natural world around us .",
    "one approach is suitable for systems with a small number of degrees of freedom , such as a harmonic oscillator , a pair of gravitating bodies , and a hydrogen atom . in this case",
    ", the goal is to formulate and solve dynamical equations of motion of the system , be it within newtonian , relativistic , or quantum mechanics .",
    "this approach is widely used beyond physics to study dynamical systems in chemistry , biology , economics , etc . in the opposite limiting case",
    ", we deal with systems consisting of a very large number of degrees of freedom . in such cases ,",
    "statistical description is employed , and the systems are characterized by probability distributions . in principle , it should be possible to derive statistical description from microscopic dynamics , but it is rarely feasible in practice .",
    "thus , it is common to use general principles of the theory of probabilities to describe statistical systems , rather than to derive their properties from microscopic equations of motion .",
    "statistical systems are common in physics , chemistry , biology , economics , etc",
    ".    any probability distribution can be thought of as representing some sort of `` inequality '' among the constituent objects of the system , in the sense that the objects have different values of a given variable .",
    "thus , a study of probability distributions is also a study of inequality developing in a system for statistical reasons . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider an economic system with a large number of interacting agents . in the unrealistic case where all agents have exactly the same values of economic variables ,",
    "the system can be treated as a single agent called the `` representative agent . ''",
    "this approach is common in traditional economics , but , by construction , it precludes a study of inequality among the agents . however , social and economic inequality is ubiquitous in the real world , and its characterization and understanding are very important issues .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the well - developed methods of statistical physics to economics and society in order to gain insights into probability distributions and inequality in these systems .",
    "we consider three specific cases : the distributions of money , income , and global energy consumption . in all three cases ,",
    "the common theme is entropy maximization for partitioning of a limited resource among multiple agents . despite the difference in the nature of the considered variables ,",
    "we find a common pattern of inequality in these cases .",
    "this approach can be also useful for studying other statistical systems beyond the three specific cases considered in this paper .",
    "applications of these ideas to money and income have been published in the literature before : see review @xcite . to introduce these ideas and to make the paper",
    "self - contained , we briefly review the applications to money and income in and . also shows the latest available data for income distribution in 2007 , not published before . in , we present a quantitative study of the probability distribution of energy consumption per capita around the world .",
    "this is a new kind of study that , to the best of our knowledge , has not appeared before in the literature .",
    "let us consider a general mathematical problem of partitioning ( dividing ) a limited resource among a large number of agents .",
    "the solution of this problem is similar to the derivation of the boltzmann - gibbs distribution of energy in physics @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "let us apply it to the probability distribution of money in a closed economic system .",
    "following @xcite , let us consider a system consisting of @xmath0 economic agents .",
    "at any moment of time , each agent @xmath1 has a money balance @xmath2 .",
    "agents make pairwise economic transactions with each other . as a result of a transaction ,",
    "the money @xmath3 is transferred from an agent @xmath1 to an agent @xmath4 , so their money balances change as follows @xmath5 the total money of the two agents before and after transaction remains the same @xmath6 i.e. ,  there is a local conservation law for money .",
    "it is implied that the agent @xmath4 delivers some goods or services to the agent @xmath1 in exchange for the money payment @xmath3 .",
    "however , we do not keep track of what is delivered and only keep track of money balances .",
    "goods , such as food , can be produced and consumed , so they are not conserved .",
    "rule ( [ transfer ] ) for the transfer of money is analogous to the transfer of energy from one molecule to another in molecular collisions in a gas , and rule ( [ conservation ] ) is analogous to conservation of energy in such collisions .",
    "it is important to recognize that ordinary economic agents can not `` manufacture '' money ( even though they can produce and consume goods ) .",
    "the agents can only receive money from and give it to other economic agents . in a closed system ,",
    "the local conservation law ( [ conservation ] ) implies the global conservation law for the total money @xmath7 in the system . in the real economy , @xmath8 may change due to money emission by the central government or central bank , but we will not consider these processes here .",
    "another possible complication is debt , which may be considered as negative money .",
    "here we consider a model where debt is not permitted , so all money balances are non - negative @xmath9 .",
    "after many transactions between different agents , we expect that a stationary probability distribution of money would develop in the system .",
    "it can be characterized as follows .",
    "let us divide the money axis @xmath10 into the intervals ( bins ) of a small width @xmath11 and label them with an integer variable @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the number of agents with the money balances between @xmath14 and @xmath15 . and @xmath16 to label the money bins @xmath14 and the indices @xmath1 and @xmath4 to label the individual money balances @xmath2 of the agents .",
    "] then , the probability to have a money balance in this interval is @xmath17 .",
    "we would like to find the stationary probability distribution of money @xmath18 , which is achieved in statistical equilibrium .",
    "because the total money @xmath8 in the system is conserved , the problem reduces to partitioning ( division ) of the limited resource @xmath8 among @xmath0 agents .",
    "one possibility is an equal division , where each agents gets the same share @xmath19 of the total money .",
    "however , such an equal partition would be extremely improbable .",
    "it is more reasonable to obtain the probability distribution of money from the principle of entropy maximization .",
    "let us consider a certain set of occupation numbers @xmath13 of the money bins @xmath14 .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath20 is the number of different realizations of this configuration , i.e. , the number of different placements of the agents into the bins preserving the same set of occupation numbers @xmath13 .",
    "it is given by the combinatorial formula in terms of the factorials @xmath21 the logarithm of multiplicity is called the entropy @xmath22 . in the limit of large numbers , we can use the stirling approximation for the factorials @xmath23    in statistical equilibrium , the entropy @xmath24 is maximized with respect to the numbers @xmath13 under the constraints that the total number of agents @xmath25 and the total money @xmath26 are fixed . to solve this problem",
    ", we introduce the lagrange multipliers @xmath27 and @xmath28 and construct the modified entropy @xmath29 maximization of entropy is achieved by setting the derivatives @xmath30 to zero for each @xmath13 . substituting into and taking the derivatives in should be also differentiated with respect to @xmath13 . ] , we find that the equilibrium probability distribution of money @xmath18 is an exponential function of @xmath10 @xmath31 here the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the analogs of temperature and chemical potential for money .",
    "their values are determined by the constraints @xmath34 @xmath35 we see that the money temperature @xmath36 is nothing but the average amount of money per agent .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath37 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 .",
    "shows quite generally that division of a conserved limited resource using the principle of entropy maximization results in the exponential probability distribution of this resource among the agents . in physics ,",
    "the `` limited resource '' is the energy @xmath39 divided among @xmath0 molecules of a gas , and the result is the boltzmann - gibbs distribution of energy @xcite .",
    "the exponential distribution of money was proposed in @xcite , albeit without explicit discussion of the chemical potential , as well as in @xcite .",
    "various models for kinetic exchange of money are reviewed in @xcite and in the popular article @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the underlying assumptions of money conservation and random exchange of money is discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analogy between energy and money is mentioned in some physics textbooks @xcite , but not developed in detail .      to illustrate some consequences of the statistical mechanics of money ,",
    "let us consider two systems with different money temperatures @xmath40 .",
    "these can be two countries with different average amounts of money per capita : the `` rich '' country with @xmath41 and the `` poor '' with @xmath42 .",
    "suppose a limited flow of money and agents is permitted between the two systems .",
    "given that the variation @xmath43 vanishes due to maximization under constraints , we conclude from that @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the flow of money and agents from system 1 to system 2 , then the change of the total entropy of the two systems is @xmath47 according to the second law of thermodynamics , the total entropy should be increasing , so @xmath48 . then , the first term in shows that money should be flowing from the high - temperature system ( rich country ) to the low - temperature system ( poor country ) .",
    "this is called the trade deficit  a systematic net flow of money from one country to another ,",
    "which is best exemplified by the trade between usa and china . the second term in shows that the agents would be flowing from high to low chemical potential , which corresponds to immigration from a poor to a rich country .",
    "both trade deficit and immigration are widespread global phenomena .",
    "the direction of these processes can be also understood from .",
    "the two systems are trying to equilibrate their money temperatures @xmath49 , which can be achieved either by changing the numerators due to money flow or the denominators due to people flow .",
    "thermal physics has two counterparts : statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "statistical mechanics of money was outlined in .",
    "is it possible to construct an analog of thermodynamics for money ?",
    "many attempts were made in the literature , but none was completely successful : see reviews @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the important concepts in thermodynamics is the distinction between heat and work . in statistical physics",
    ", this distinction can be microscopically interpreted as follows @xcite .",
    "the internal energy of the system is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is an energy level , and @xmath13 is the occupation number of this level",
    ". suppose the energy levels @xmath52 depend on some external parameters @xmath53 , such as the volume of a box in quantum mechanics , an external magnetic field acting on spins , etc .",
    "then , the variation of @xmath54 contains two terms @xmath55 .",
    "the first term has mechanical origin and comes from the variation @xmath56 of the energy levels due to changes of the external parameters @xmath53 .",
    "this term is interpreted as the work @xmath57 done on the system externally .",
    "the second term has statistical origin and comes from the changes @xmath58 in the occupation numbers of the energy levels .",
    "this term is interpreted as the heat @xmath59 .",
    "an analog of this construction does not seem to exist for money @xmath26 .",
    "a variation @xmath60 is possible due to changes in the occupation numbers , but there is no analog of the variation @xmath61 of the `` money levels '' due to changes in some external parameters .",
    "thus , we can only define the heat term , but not the work term in the money variation . indeed , is the analog of the first law of thermodynamics for money , but there is no term corresponding to work in this equation .    nevertheless , statistical mechanics of money can be extended to a form somewhat resembling conventional thermodynamics , if we take into account the material property of the agents .",
    "let us define the wealth @xmath62 of an agent @xmath1 as a sum of two terms .",
    "one term represents the money balance @xmath2 , and another term the material property , such as a house , a car , stocks , etc . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider only one type of property , so that the agent has @xmath63 physical units of this property .",
    "in order to determine the monetary value of this property , we need to know the price @xmath64 per unit .",
    "then , the wealth of the agent is @xmath65 . correspondingly , the total wealth @xmath66 in the system is to denote wealth , not work . ]",
    "@xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total `` volume '' of the property in the system .",
    "if money @xmath8 is analogous to the internal energy @xmath54 in statistical physics , then wealth @xmath66 is analogous to the enthalpy @xmath69 .",
    "the wealth @xmath66 includes not only the money @xmath8 , but also the money equivalent necessary to acquire the volume @xmath70 of property at the price @xmath64 per unit .",
    "let us consider the differential of wealth @xmath71 here the first two terms cancel out , and only the last term remains .",
    "indeed , when the volume @xmath72 of property is acquired , the money @xmath73 is paid for the property , i.e. ,  money is exchanged for property .",
    "is also valid at the level of individual agents , @xmath74 .",
    "these equations show that wealth changes only when the price @xmath64 changes .     and @xmath64 represents the volume and price of goods . ]    to advance the analogy with thermodynamics , let us consider a closed cycle in the @xmath75 plane illustrated in .",
    "this cycle can be interpreted as a model of stock market speculation , in which case @xmath70 is the volume of stock held by a speculator .",
    "starting from the lower left corner , the speculator purchases the stock at the low price @xmath76 and increases the owned volume from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "then , the price increases from @xmath76 to @xmath79 . at this point",
    ", the speculator sells the stock at the high price @xmath79 , reducing the owned volume from @xmath78 to @xmath77 .",
    "then , the price of the stock drops to the level @xmath76 , and the cycle can be repeated . from ,",
    "we find that the wealth change of the speculator is @xmath80 , which is the area @xmath81 enclosed by the cycle in . from , we also find that @xmath82 , because @xmath64 and @xmath70 return to the initial values at the end of the cycle .",
    "thus , the monetary profit @xmath83 is given by the area enclosed by the cycle .",
    "this money is extracted by the speculator from the other players in the market , so the conservation law of money is not violated . in the ideal economic equilibrium , there should be no price changes allowing one to make systematic profits , which is known as the `` no - arbitrage theorem '' .",
    "however , in the real market , significant rises and falls of stock prices do happen , especially during speculative bubbles .",
    "the cycle in also illustrates the trade between china and usa .",
    "suppose a trade company pays money @xmath84 to buy the volume @xmath85 of the products manufactured in china at the low price @xmath76 .",
    "after shipping across pacific ocean , the products are sold in usa at the high price @xmath79 , and the company receives money @xmath86 .",
    "empty ships return to china , and the cycle repeats . as shown in @xcite , the price level @xmath64 is generally proportional to the money temperature @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the profit rate in this cycle is @xmath87 by analogy with physics , one can prove that gives the highest possible profit rate for the given temperatures @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , from with @xmath88 , we find that @xmath89 and @xmath90 . under the most ideal circumstances ,",
    "the total entropy of the whole system remains constant , so @xmath91 .",
    "then , @xmath92 , and follows .",
    "here we assumed that the profit money @xmath93 has low ( ideally zero ) entropy , because this money is concentrated in the hands of just one agent or trading company and is not dispersed among many agents of the systems .",
    "thermal machines have cycles analogous to , and equation is similar to the carnot formula for the highest possible efficiency @xcite .",
    "the china - usa trade cycle resembles an internal combustion engine , where the purchase of goods from china mimics fuel intake , and the sales of goods in usa mimics expulsion of exhaust .",
    "the net result is that goods are manufactured in china and consumed in usa .",
    "the analogy between trade cycles and thermal machines was highlighted by mimkes @xcite .",
    "although somewhat similar to @xcite , our presentation emphasizes conceptual distinction between money and wealth and explicitly connects statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "empirical data on the international trade network between different countries were analyzed in several papers .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed trade imbalances , defined as the _ difference _ between exports and imports from one country to another .",
    "the paper classified countries as net consumers and net producers of goods .",
    "the typical examples are usa and china , respectively , as illustrated in figure 2 of @xcite for 2000 , in qualitative agreement with our discussion above . in contrast , bhattacharya _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied trade volumes , defined as the _ sum _ of exports and imports from one country to another .",
    "the paper found that the trade volume @xmath94 of a country is proportional to the gross domestic product ( gdp ) of the country : @xmath95 with the exponent @xmath96 .",
    "it means that the trade volume and gdp are _ extensive _ variables in the language of thermodynamics , so the biggest volumes of trade are between the countries with the biggest gdps . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "money flows between two countries in both directions as payment for traded goods , but the money fluxes in the opposite directions are equal , so there is trade volume , but no trade imbalance .",
    "trade imbalance may develop when the two systems have different values of _ intensive _ parameters , such as the money temperature .",
    "then , the direction of net money flow is determined by the sign of the temperature difference .",
    "of course , there may be other reasons and mechanisms for trade imbalance besides the temperature difference .",
    "normally , the flow of money from the high- to low - temperature system should reduce the temperature difference and eventually bring the systems to equilibrium . indeed , in the global trade",
    ", many formerly low - temperature countries have increased their temperatures as a result of such trade .",
    "however , the situation with china is special , because the chinese government redirects the flow of dollars back to usa by buying treasury bills from the us government . as a result",
    ", the temperature difference remains approximately constant and does not show signs of equilibration .",
    "the net result is that china supplies vast amounts of products to usa in exchange for debt obligations from the us government .",
    "the long - term global consequences of this process remain to be seen .",
    "illustrates that there are two circuits in a well - developed market economy @xcite .",
    "one is the circuit of money , which consists of money payments between the agents for goods and services .",
    "as argued in , money is conserved in these transactions and , thus , can be modeled as flow of liquid , e.g. , blood in the vascular system .",
    "( a hydraulic device , the moniac , was actually used by william philips , the inventor of the famous philips curve , to illustrate money flow in the economy @xcite . )",
    "the second circuit is the flow of goods and services between the agents .",
    "this circuit involves manufacturing , distribution , and consumption .",
    "the goods and services are inherently not conserved .",
    "they represent the material ( physical ) side of the economy and , arguably , are the ultimate goal for the well - being of a society . in contrast , money represents the informational , virtual side of the economy , because money can not be physically consumed .",
    "nevertheless , money does play a very important role in the economy by enabling its efficient functioning and by guiding resource allocation in a society .",
    "the two circuits interact with each other when goods and services are traded ( exchanged ) for money .",
    "however , money can not be physically transformed into goods and vice versa . to illustrate this point",
    ", we draw an analogy with fermions and bosons in physics .",
    "while the `` circuits '' of fermions and bosons interact and transfer energy between each other , it is not possible to convert a fermion into a boson and vice versa .",
    "the important consequence of this consideration is that an increase of material production in the circuit of goods and services does not have any direct effect on the amount of money in the monetary circuit .",
    "the amount of money in the system depends primarily on the monetary policy of the central bank or government , who have the monopoly on issuing money .",
    "technological progress in material production does not produce any automatic increase of money in the system .",
    "thus , the expectation of continuous monetary growth , where the agents would be getting more and more money as a result of technological progress , is false .",
    "it is not possible for all businesses to operate with profit on average , i.e. , to have the greater total amount of money at the end of a cycle than at the beginning .",
    "the agents can get more money on average only if the government decides to print money , i.e. ,  to increase the money temperature @xmath49 .",
    "thus , monetary growth of the economy is directly related to the deficit spending by the central government . on the other hand , it is very well possible to have technological progress and an increase in the physical standards of living without monetary growth .",
    "the monetary and physical circuits of the economy interact with each other , but they are separate circuits . unfortunately , this distinction is often blurred in the econophysics and economics literature @xcite , as well as in the public perception .",
    "although the exponential probability distribution of money was proposed 10 years ago @xcite , no direct statistical data on money distribution are available to verify this conjecture .",
    "normally , people do not report their money balances to statistical agencies .",
    "given that most people keep their money in banks , the distribution of balances on bank accounts can give a reasonable approximation of the probability distribution of money .",
    "however , these data are privately held by banks and not available publicly .    on the other hand ,",
    "a lot of statistical data are available on income distribution , because people report income to the government tax agencies . to some extent",
    ", income distribution can also be viewed as a problem of partitioning of a limited resource , in this case of the total annual budget .",
    "following , we expect to find the exponential distribution for income .",
    "drgulescu and yakovenko @xcite studied the data on income distribution in usa from the internal revenue service ( irs ) and from the us census bureau .",
    "they found that income distribution is indeed exponential for incomes below 120 k$ per year .",
    "however , in the subsequent papers @xcite , they also found that the upper tail of income distribution follows a power law , as was first pointed out by pareto @xcite .",
    "so , the data analysis of income distribution in usa reveals coexistence of two social classes . the lower class ( about 97% of population ) is characterized by the exponential boltzmann - gibbs distribution , and the upper class ( the top 3% percent of the population ) has the power - law pareto distribution .",
    "time evolution of the income classes in 19832001 was studied by silva and yakovenko @xcite .",
    "they found that the exponential distribution in the lower class is very stable in time , whereas the power - law distribution of the upper class is highly dynamical and volatile .",
    "they concluded that the lower class is in thermal equilibrium , whereas the upper class is out of equilibrium .",
    "many other papers investigated income distributions in different countries : see the review @xcite for references .",
    "the coexistence of two classes appears to be a universal feature of income distribution . in this section ,",
    "we present a unified description of the two classes within a single mathematical model .",
    "the two - class structure of income distribution can be rationalized on the basis of a kinetic approach .",
    "suppose the income @xmath97 of an agent behaves like a stochastic variable .",
    "let @xmath98 denote the probability distribution of @xmath97 at time @xmath99 .",
    "let us consider a diffusion model , where the income @xmath97 changes by @xmath100 over a time period @xmath101 .",
    "then , the temporal evolution of @xmath98 is described by the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath102 + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2}\\left    [ b(r)p(r , t)\\right ] .",

    "the income comes from wages and salaries , so it is reasonable to assume that income changes are independent of income itself , i.e. ,  @xmath100 is independent of @xmath97 .",
    "this process is called the additive diffusion @xcite . in this case , the coefficients in ( [ diffusion ] ) are some constants @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "then ( [ stationary ] ) gives the exponential distribution @xmath114 on the other hand , the upper - class income comes from bonuses , investments , and capital gains , which are calculated in percentages .",
    "therefore , for the upper class , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath115 , i.e. ,  income changes are proportional to income itself .",
    "this is known as the proportionality principle of gibrat @xcite , and the process is called the multiplicative diffusion @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath116 and @xmath117 , and ( [ stationary ] ) gives a power - law distribution @xmath118 the multiplicative hypothesis for the upper class income was quantitatively verified in @xcite for japan , where tax identification data are officially published for the top taxpayers .",
    "the additive and multiplicative processes may coexist .",

    ", @xmath138 exhibits discontinuities at each @xmath132 because of the approximation used in our procedure .",
    "given the relatively small number of data points ( @xmath139 ) and discontinuities of the plot , it is not practical to do a quantitative fit of the data . nevertheless , the empirically constructed function @xmath140 can be compared with the theoretical function @xmath141 , which is shown by the solid line in . here the temperature @xmath142  kw is the average global energy consumption per capita , obtained by dividing the total energy consumption of all countries by their total population .",
    "this value is indicated by the arrow in .",
    "( for comparison , the physiological energy consumption at rest by a female of the weight 53 kg is 63 w @xcite . )",
    "the exponential function does not fit the data perfectly , but it captures the main features reasonably well , given the crudeness of the data .",
    "the agreement is remarkable , given that the solid line is not a fit , but a plot of a function with one parameter @xmath38 fixed by the global average .        in order to make an additional visual comparison between the theory and the data , the functions @xmath138 and @xmath143",
    "are plotted in in the log - linear scale and in in the log - log scale . in , we see that the empirical data points oscillate around the theoretical exponential function shown by the straight line .",
    "the data jumps for high @xmath131 are unnaturally magnified in the logarithmic scale .",
    "demonstrates that the empirical data points do not fall on a straight line in the log - log scale , so the energy consumption per capita is not described by a power law .",
    "indeed , energy production and consumption are physically limited and have the characteristic average scale @xmath38 , so a scale - free power - law distribution would not be expected here .    we have also constructed the plots for co@xmath144 emission per capita using the data from wri @xcite .",
    "they look essentially the same as the plots for energy consumption per capita , in agreement with findings by other authors @xcite , because most of energy in the world is currently generated from fossil fuel .      , , and give different visual representations of @xmath145 , but have certain shortcomings .",
    "emphasizes the low end of the data , whereas and emphasize the high end .",
    "all figures suffer from discontinuities .",
    "a smoother visualization can be achieved in the lorenz plot for energy consumption per capita . as in",
    ", the empirical lorenz curve is constructed parametrically @xmath146 the horizontal coordinate @xmath147 gives the fraction of global population with energy consumption per capita below @xmath131 , and @xmath148 gives the total energy consumption of this population as a fraction of the global consumption .",
    "when @xmath16 runs from 1 to @xmath135 , we obtain a set of points in the @xmath149 plane representing the lorenz plot .",
    "the empirically constructed lorenz plots for 1990 , 2000 , and 2005 are shown in using different colors . by construction , the lorenz plots are continuous without jumps , although the slope ( the derivative ) of the @xmath150 curve is discontinuous .",
    "another advantage of the lorenz plot is that it emphasizes the data where most of the population is , i.e. , the range from the bottom 5% to the top 95% of the population sorted according to their energy consumption per capita .",
    "the black solid line shows the theoretical lorenz curve @xmath151 for the exponential distribution .",
    "we observe that , in the first approximation , the theoretical curve captures the data reasonably well , especially given that the curve has no fitting parameters at all . upon a closer examination",
    ", we notice a systematic historical evolution of the empirical curves . from 1990 to 2005",
    ", the data points moved closer to the diagonal , which indicates that global inequality of energy consumption decreased .",
    "this is confirmed by the decrease of the calculated gini coefficient @xmath130 , which is listed in .        on the lorenz plot for 1990 ,",
    "we notice a kink or a knee indicated by the arrow , where the slope of the curve changes appreciably .",
    "this point represents the boundary between developed and developing countries .",
    "indeed , below this point we find mexico , brazil , china , and india , whereas above this point we find britain , france , australia , russia , and usa .",
    "the conclusion is that the difference between developed and developing countries lies in the degree of energy consumption and utilization .",
    "this criterion provides a physical measure for such a distinction , as opposed to more ephemeral monetary measures , such as dollar income per capita .    comparing the lorenz plots for 2000 and 2005 with the plot for 1990 , we observe that the kink in the plots is progressively smoothed out .",
    "it means that the gap in energy consumption per capita between developed and developing countries is shrinking .",
    "we attribute this result to rapid globalization of the world economy in the last 20 years .",
    "nevertheless , the distribution of energy consumption per capita around the world still remains highly unequal .",
    "we observe in that the lorenz plot has moved closer to the solid curve representing the exponential distribution .",
    "based on the general arguments about partitioning of a limited resource , we expect that the result of a well - mixed globalized world economy would not be an equal energy consumption , but the exponential distribution .",
    "thus , it is not likely that the energy consumption inequality will be eliminated in the foreseeable future .",
    "it is generally known that energy consumption per capita and gdp per capita are positively correlated , and energy consumption is the physical basis for economic prosperity @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found a power - law relation @xmath152 between these two variables by analyzing the data for different countries around the world ( see figure 3a in @xcite ) .",
    "the last three columns in show the data for gdp per capita @xcite .",
    "although this variable is generally correlated with the energy consumption per capita , the monetary and the physical measures are not always well aligned .",
    "the movement of sustainable economics @xcite criticized gdp as a useful measure of economic prosperity .",
    "in this paper , we study probability distributions of money , income , and energy consumption per capita for ensembles of economic agents . following the principle of entropy maximization for partitioning of a limited resource among many agents ,",
    "we find exponential distributions for the investigated variables .",
    "using an analogy with thermodynamics , we discuss trade deficit and immigration between two countries with different money temperatures . considering a cycle similar to a thermal engine ,",
    "we discuss how a monetary profit can be extracted in the presence of non - equilibrium due to a temperature difference",
    ".    then we study a fokker - planck equation for income diffusion with additive and multiplicative components .",
    "the resulting probability distribution of income interpolates between the exponential function ( boltzmann - gibbs ) at the low end and the power law ( pareto ) at the high end .",
    "this function agrees well with the empirical income distribution data in usa obtained from the internal revenue service .",
    "while the exponential distribution in the lower class remains stable in time , the income fraction @xmath129 going to the upper tail expands dramatically during speculative bubbles and shrinks when the bubbles burst .",
    "overall , income inequality in usa has increased significantly from 1983 to 2007 , so that now @xmath129 exceeds 20% of the total income in the system .",
    "we also discuss reasons why the pareto exponent tends to have the value about @xmath153 in the steady state in the absence of bubbles .",
    "finally , we analyze the probability distribution of energy consumption per capita around the world using the data from the world resources institute .",
    "we find that the distribution is reasonably described by the exponential function with the average global consumption as the effective temperature .",
    "a closer examination finds a gap in energy consumption between developed and developing countries , which tends to shrink as time progresses .",
    "we attribute this effect to globalization of the world economy . the inequality of energy consumption decreased from 1990 to 2005 , while the corresponding lorenz plot moved closer to the exponential distribution .    in conclusion",
    ", we observe that statistical problems of different nature have common mathematical description and exhibit similar and universal patterns of inequality .",
    "thus , statistical approach gives an insight into the persistent and ubiquitous nature of inequality in the world around us .",
    "the approach presented here can be also applied to other statistical problems .",
