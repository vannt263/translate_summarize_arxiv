    "the composition and properties of matter under extreme conditions as they can be found in the deep dense interior of neutron stars has been a subject of investigation over the last six decades .",
    "the large densities inside the star should be sufficient to bear new `` exotic '' strange components like hyperons @xcite , kaons @xcite or even to melt the baryons to form a deconfined quark matter phase . the appearance of such components may significantly change the gross structure of the star like its mass and radius .    since the pioneering work two decades ago @xcite the fascinating possibility of a deconfined quark matter phase in the interior of neutron stars has stimulated the work of many authors @xcite .",
    "moreover , recently glendenning , pei and weber @xcite proposed that an observable signature in the timing structure of pulsars could even provide a signal for the existence of such a quark matter phase in the cores of pulsars .",
    "neutron stars which are made of hadronic matter in the outer region , but possessing a strange quark matter ( sqm ) core in their interior are called hybrid stars .",
    "the essential uncertainty for all theoretical investigations dealing with the question whether or not such phase exists , is clearly the equation of state ( eos ) from about normal nuclear matter density @xmath0 to the order of @xmath1 achieved in the center of the star .",
    "so far , there is unfortunately no single theory to cover this density range with respect to quark degrees of freedom .",
    "we therefore still depend on separate descriptions including the basic degrees of freedom of dense hadronic matter and quark matter , respectively .",
    "the eos for the description of sqm in the framework of the commonly used mit bag model was recently improved by including medium effects @xcite .",
    "this was done by using a quasi - particle approach , successfully used in various parts of physics .",
    "the interaction of the quarks with the other quarks of the system is implemented by giving them density dependent effective quark masses .",
    "this should lead to a more realistic description of quark matter going beyond the free fermi gas approximation .",
    "we will refer to this model @xcite as the `` effective mass bag model '' .",
    "it was found that medium effects increase the energy per baryon of sqm and therefore make the sqm phase energetically less favorable .",
    "the physical reason for the larger energy per baryon is the increase of the effective quark masses in medium @xcite .",
    "the scope of this work is to study the influence of these medium effects on the gross structure of non - rotating hybrid stars and on the existence of the sqm phase inside the star . in section [ effectmassbagmodel ] , we review the inclusion of medium effects in the eos of sqm within the effective mass bag model @xcite . in section [ hadroniceos ] ,",
    "we shortly discuss the used hadronic eos , before we come to the construction of the phase transition between quark and hadronic matter in section [ construction ] .",
    "finally , we discuss in detail the results of the influence of medium effects on the gross structure of hybrid stars in section [ grossstructure ] .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the strange quark matter phase containing an approximately equal amount of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4-quarks ( sqm ) has been suggested as a possible stable or metastable phase of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the eos of sqm is usually described in the framework of a bag model i.e.  as a non - interacting fermi gas of quarks at zero temperature , taking into account the bag constant @xcite .",
    "quark interactions within lowest order perturbative qcd have also been considered .    in all parts of physics from solid - state physics to nuclear and high - energy physics @xcite , the quasi particle picture is successfully used to describe complicated interactions and collective effects like medium effects in many particle systems .",
    "the particles of such systems are thought to acquire an effective mass by the interaction of the particles with the system .",
    "adopting this quasi particle approach , recently medium effects were included in the eos of sqm in the framework of the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "there , the quarks are considered as quasi - particles which acquire an effective mass by the interaction with the other quarks of the dense system .",
    "the effective quark masses follow from the pole of the resummed one - loop quark propagator at finite chemical potential ( fig .",
    "[ dyson ] ) which is calculated in the hard dense loop approximation @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath5 for the light quarks ( i.e.  @xmath2,@xmath3-quarks ) and @xmath6 for massive quarks with current quark mass @xmath7 ( @xmath4-quarks ) .",
    "note that the effective masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 increase with the strong coupling constant @xmath10 and the quark chemical potential @xmath11 .",
    "the effective masses ( [ defmq ] ) , ( [ defms ] ) are used in the ideal fermi gas eos at temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the thermodynamic self - consistency of the eos is fulfilled in the sense of @xcite .",
    "finally this corresponds to inserting the effective masses @xmath13 directly into the fermi gas expression for the one particle density ( where @xmath3 is the degree of degeneracy ) @xmath14 and extracting the pressure @xmath15 and energy density @xmath16 from the thermodynamic relations @xmath17 for more details see @xcite .",
    "the overall pressure @xmath18 and energy density @xmath19 of the quark phase ( qp ) is the sum of the expressions for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4-quarks plus the corresponding fermi gas expressions for the uniform background of electrons .",
    "a phenomenological bag constant @xmath20 is introduced in the usual way by adding it to the energy density and subtracting it from the pressure @xmath21 the bag constant @xmath20 is supposed to mimic the influence of confinement and corresponds to the energy difference between the perturbative vacuum inside the deconfined quark matter phase and the `` true '' vacuum outside .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the energy per baryon of sqm increases with increasing coupling constant @xmath10 due to an increase of the effective masses ( [ defmq ] ) , ( [ defms ] ) .",
    "this makes the qp energetically less favorable which  as we will see  will reduce the extent of a pure qp inside the hybrid star .",
    "now we want to discuss the parameters that enter into the description of quark matter in the effective mass bag model .",
    "the most important parameters are the bag constant @xmath20 and the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "for the current quark masses we assume @xmath22 for @xmath2 and @xmath3-quarks and for @xmath4-quarks .",
    "we have already mentioned that the phenomenological bag constant @xmath20 is directly related to the pressure @xmath18 which finally determines which kind of phase is realized at given chemical potential ( we will discuss this construction in detail in section [ construction ] ) .",
    "the choice of its value has a strong impact on the gross structure of the star .",
    "unfortunately , the exact value of the bag constant describing a quark system is far from being settled .",
    "this is especially true in connection with a quasi particle model like ours which may lead to a smaller effective @xmath20 as in the case of a free model @xcite .",
    "we therefore take @xmath20 as a rather free parameter and choose a value which is appropriate for our purpose to investigate the influence of medium effects . depending on the corresponding hadronic eos ,",
    "a too low @xmath20 ( e.g.  ) would prevent the qp ( medium effects neglected ) from being converted to hadronic matter , while a too large value would lead to a pure hadronic star . since in this work",
    "we are mainly interested in the influence of medium effects on hybrid stars , we choose a bag constant of @xmath23 indeed , if we neglect medium effects , we will see that this value ensures the existence of a pure quark core while the star is surrounded by a pure hadronic region . nevertheless , we stress that different results e.g.  for the absolute values of the quark core radius can be obtained by varying the bag constant @xcite .",
    "such variations will be systematically studied in a future work @xcite .    as a final remark ,",
    "we want to note that for our choice of the bag constant sqm in equilibrium ( @xmath24 ) is not absolutely stable with respect to hadronic matter as it was supposed by witten @xcite . neglecting medium effects",
    ", we obtain an energy per baryon of @xmath25 which is clearly above the energy per nucleon in @xmath26fe . a larger bag constant or",
    "the inclusion of medium effects will further increase @xmath27 ( see @xcite , fig .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath10 which enters into the effective quark masses ( [ defmq ] ) and ( [ defms ] ) is treated in two different ways :    1 .   fixed coupling constant @xmath28 const .",
    "[ gconst ] ) 2 .",
    "running coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "[ grunning ] )    the first way is thought to study the influence of medium effects parameterized by a constant @xmath10 . since at @xmath30",
    "the quarks possess their current quark masses which corresponds to the free eos ( no medium effects ) , we can enlarge the influence of medium effects by increasing the value of @xmath10 .",
    "the second way should include the behavior of asymptotic freedom by virtue of a density dependent running coupling constant .    in both cases we have to take the perturbative nature of the effective masses ( [ defmq ] ) and ( [ defms ] ) into consideration .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves  for some convenience  to coupling constants @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . as we will see , values of @xmath10 in this range do have a sizeable effect on the eos and therefore on the structure of hybrid stars . even at smaller @xmath10 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 )",
    "modifications to @xmath30 will be realized .",
    "the applicability of results obtained in the hard dense loop limit ( see section [ effectmassbagmodel ] ) with @xmath10 taken in this range is discussed in @xcite for the similar hard thermal loop limit .",
    "it was found that the use of hard thermal loop effective masses is justified from the following point of view .",
    "the deviations of the hard thermal loop masses from the complete one - loop effective masses ( obtained without using the hard thermal loop approximation ) are indeed small and thus can be neglected in this kind of phenomenological models .",
    "to describe the hadronic phase of hybrid stars , we use an eos calculated in the framework of the nonlinear walecka model including nucleons , hyperons ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , electrons , muons and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 mesons . since the first inclusion of the full octet of the lowest lying baryons by glendenning @xcite , such relativistic mean - field models are widely used for the description of dense nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "since it is not the purpose of this work to study the influence of different hadronic models , we use a typical hadronic eos as an input and refer to @xcite for a general introduction into relativistic mean - field models and to @xcite for a detailed discussion of our particular eos and the underlying coupling constants .",
    "we choose a compression modulus of .",
    "the corresponding hadronic eos up to two times normal nuclear density will be shown later ( fig .",
    "[ eos]a , most upper curve ) . for subnuclear densities",
    "we use the baym - pethick - sutherland ( bps ) eos @xcite joined to the hadronic eos .",
    "the bps eos mainly influences the low - mass behavior of the mass - radius relation .",
    "it leads to an increasing radius with a decreasing mass , which is typically for a gravitationally bound star @xcite .",
    "one important step in the understanding of hybrid stars was done by glendenning @xcite by realizing that a mixed phase ( mp ) of deconfined quark matter and hadronic matter inside a neutron star is not strictly excluded from the star as it was believed before @xcite .",
    "such mp might have important consequences for our understanding of the observed pulsar glitch phenomena or the cooling behavior of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it is supposed to form a crystalline lattice of various geometries of the rarer phase immersed in the dominant one and probably exists over a wide range of densities @xcite .",
    "the former predicted exclusion of a mp was owing to the `` freeze out '' of a degree of freedom , e.g.  by means of the requirement of charge neutrality in both individually phases .",
    "this requirement restricts a degree of freedom which the system should originally exploit in its mp by rearranging electric charge between the two phases . every pure phase and a possible mp must of course be charge neutral but in the case of a mp this is only a _ global _ charge neutrality . hence , the quark and hadron components of the mp should still have the degree of freedom to reach their energetically favored  and possibly charged ",
    "state if only their volume proportion @xmath40 is always choosen to fulfill the condition of global charge neutrality @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the charge density of the quark phase ( qp ) and the hadronic phase ( hp ) .",
    "the volume proportion @xmath40 of the phases denotes the volume fraction @xmath44 occupied by the qp . if we do not allow the system to exploit this degree of freedom we will end up with a mp of constant pressure as it is e.g.  known from a gas - liquid phase transition in a familiar one - component system like water @xcite . since the pressure inside a star must fall monotonically from its interior to its surface , a constant pressure mp could not exist over a finite region inside the star . a construction of the first - order phase transition in the sense of glendenning leads to quite different results . as we will see below",
    ", the pressure varies continuously in the mp with the volume proportion @xmath40 from @xmath45 ( pure hp ) to @xmath46 ( pure qp ) leading to a mp of finite extent inside the star @xcite .",
    "following glendenning , we now write down the gibbs condition for the equilibrium between qp and hp .",
    "to describe the qp including @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4-quarks and electrons , we initially have to deal with four chemical potentials ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) . since we require that the phase is in @xmath51-equilibrium , the weak reactions @xmath52 imply @xmath53 and reduce the four chemical potentials to two independent ones .",
    "the chemical potentials of the neutrinos can be taken to be zero because they can diffuse out of the star .",
    "for the remaining two chemical potentials we choose the pair ( @xmath54 , @xmath50 ) where @xmath54 is the neutron chemical potential which is related to the quark chemical potentials through the linear combination @xmath55 .",
    "the same reduction is possible for the hp where we also end up with ( @xmath54 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "@xmath56    at temperature @xmath12 the gibbs condition for mechanical and chemical equilibrium between the both phases now reads @xmath57 the pressure of both phases spans up a two dimensional surface over the ( @xmath54 , @xmath50 ) plane .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasetransition ] for a specific choice of parameters .",
    "the two surfaces hp and qp possess an intersection curve mp corresponding to all possible equilibrium states of the mixed phase where @xmath58 holds . for every point on this curve",
    "we can calculate @xmath40 by use of ( [ globalcharge ] ) to fulfill global charge neutrality of the mixed phase . from this",
    ", the corresponding energy density @xmath59 can be calculated by @xmath60 hence , by starting with a point on the mp curve  which corresponds through ( [ pmp ] ) to a given pressure @xmath61  we can calculate the energy density @xmath59 to finally obtain the eos of the mp in the form @xmath62 .",
    "the eos for the pure hp and pure qp was already discussed in the previous sections .",
    "the pure hp is realized at a given @xmath63 if @xmath64 while the pure qp is realized if @xmath65 holds .",
    "the pure charge neutral phases are given by curve a for the hp at low pressure and by b for the qp in the high pressure regime ( see fig .",
    "[ phasetransition ] ) .",
    "these curves are defined by the constraint of charge neutrality ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 for curve a and b , respectively ) .",
    "the resulting pressure curve ( which finally corresponds to the complete eos for hybrid stars ) is therefore given by the white curve a - mp - b . obviously the pressure varies continuously along the mp curve and is monotonically increasing .",
    "this clearly shows that a constant pressure construction is not even sufficient in the sense of an approximation .",
    "we end up with an eos for hybrid stars which suggests the existence of a mixed phase over a finite range inside the star .",
    "to investigate first the general influence of medium effects on the mass - radius ( mr ) relations and the structure of the stars , we consider @xmath10 in the next subsection as a constant parameter ranging from ( no medium effects ) to @xmath68 . in the following subsection we will restrict the parameter range by using a density dependent running coupling . to calculate the mr relation of the star we have to integrate the general relativistic equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a non - rotating spherical star , the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation ( tov ) @xcite .",
    "the eos enters into the tov equation solely in the form @xmath62 .      for constant @xmath10 the hybrid star eos obtained from the phase transition construction ( sect .",
    "[ construction ] ) in the @xmath62 form is shown in fig .",
    "[ eos]a for low and fig .",
    "[ eos]b for high energy densities .",
    "@xmath69    for every @xmath10 , the corresponding eos is divided into three parts .",
    "these are  from low to high densities  the pure hadronic phase ( hp ) , the mixed phase ( mp ) of quark and hadronic matter and the pure quark phase ( qp ) . to distinguish the three parts , the region below the @xmath70 curve corresponding to the mp is shaded gray .",
    "again we can see that pressure varies continuously in the mp .",
    "as already found by other authors @xcite , the onset of the phase transition to the qp may already occur at densities of the order of the normal nuclear density @xmath71 mev/@xmath72 g/@xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ eos]a ) . a larger bag constant",
    "@xmath20 would shift the onset to higher densities @xcite .    comparing fig .",
    "[ eos]a with fig .",
    "[ eos]b , it is important to note , that an increase of @xmath10 from @xmath30 to @xmath74 only slightly shifts the onset of the phase transition from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , while the onset of the pure qp is much more sensitive to a change of @xmath10 .",
    "it is shifted from @xmath77 to @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ eos]b ) .",
    "this suggests that medium effects mainly influence the transition point between mp and qp while leaving the transition point between hp and mp more or less unchanged .",
    "this finally leads to an enlarged density range of the mp .",
    "one may now ask for the reason for this behavior .",
    "there are indications that the small influence of the @xmath79 transition density on a change of @xmath10 is due to the fact that the transition density ( i.e. the density of the onset of quarks ) is below the onset of the hyperons in the hadronic phase ( which is typically between @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite ) .",
    "this is obviously fulfilled from @xmath30 to @xmath74 in fig .",
    "but the transition density @xmath82 of the @xmath74 result is just at the threshold of the onset of hyperons . indeed , if we further increase @xmath10 to say @xmath83 ( which is not shown in fig .",
    "[ eos]a ) , we find that the transition density now strongly increases to @xmath84",
    ". we can get a qualitative feeling for this behavior if we look again at fig .",
    "[ phasetransition ] which shows the @xmath74 calculation .",
    "the point where the pure charge neutral hp curve ( a ) meets the mp curve corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "up to about this density , the chemical potentials of curve a basically increase in the @xmath50 direction which corresponds to a slight increase of @xmath59 . hence ,",
    "as long as the transition point for a given @xmath10 is on this part of the a curve , the transition density is rather insensitive on a change of @xmath10 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath85 . at the onset of the hyperons ( especially of the negative charged @xmath36 )",
    "the electron chemical potential @xmath50 does not increase further and remains at roughly about @xmath86 mev .",
    "now the chemical potentials basically increase in the @xmath54 direction corresponding to a strong increase of @xmath59 . due to the onset of hyperons the hadronic eos",
    "is softened which shifts the @xmath79 transition density to higher values .",
    "the influence of @xmath10 on this transition density is now comparable to the large influence on the @xmath87 transition density .",
    "the latter is large because of an approximately constant @xmath50 of about @xmath88 mev ( see curve b in fig .  [ phasetransition ] ) .",
    "therefore , one could say that the @xmath79 transition density is only slightly influenced by medium effects as long as there are no hyperons present at these densities .",
    "let us now discuss qualitatively how this interesting behavior of the eos will influence the structure of the star .",
    "for that reason , let us assume a star with a typical _ central energy density _",
    "@xmath89 of @xmath90 . at @xmath30",
    "this corresponds to a star of @xmath91 . if we look at fig .",
    "[ eos]b ( @xmath30 ) we find that @xmath89 is on the right hand side of the ( dark ) gray shaded mp region which ends at @xmath92 .",
    "hence , the star should possess a qp core .",
    "following the star from its center outwards ( decreasing @xmath59 ) we obtain a large density region ( from @xmath93 down to @xmath94 ) where the star is in its qp . if we now increase the coupling constant to @xmath95 we see how the density range occupied by the pure qp is narrowed .",
    "thus , the extent of the qp core is reduced . at @xmath74",
    "our assumed @xmath89 is not sufficient to bear a pure qp core .",
    "the star has a mp core .",
    "this is due to the strong increase of the @xmath87 transition density which shifts the onset of a pure qp to @xmath96 at @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ eos]b ) .",
    "such large densities can only be achieved in rather soft eos in which the gravitational force is able to compress matter to larger central densities .",
    "this does not apply to our case of an increased coupling constant . if we look at fig .",
    "[ eos]a we see that , in fact , the eos gets stiffer with increasing @xmath10 ( the pressure @xmath61 increases at fixed @xmath59 ) .",
    "this implies that the _ critical central energy density _",
    "@xmath97 ( i.e. @xmath89 at the limiting mass ) decreases with @xmath10 . therefore , increasing the coupling constant leads to a strong increase of the @xmath87 transition density while @xmath97 ( as an upper limit of @xmath89 ) is decreasing .",
    "this contrary behavior will  as we will see  lead to a surprisingly fast disappearance of a pure qp core with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "a pure hadronic star can only be formed if the @xmath79 transition density exceeds @xmath89 . since for @xmath85",
    "this transition density only slightly increases with increasing @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ eos]a ) we expect a star possessing a mp or a qp core .    finally , we observe on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ eos]b ( @xmath98 ) an almost similar eos of the pure qp for different @xmath10 .",
    "the pure quark matter eos in the form @xmath62 is therefore only slightly softened with increasing medium effects as already found in @xcite .",
    "our qualitative discussion of the eos and the resulting implications for hybrid stars will now be supported by solving the tov equation .",
    "fig.[rm1 ] shows the resulting mr relations ( star sequences ) for various values of @xmath10 ( e.g.  g1 means @xmath99 ) . for comparison , the left hand side ( @xmath100 km )",
    "shows the pure sqm star ( strange star ) results , where we do not allow the quark phase to transform into hadronic matter . in this case",
    ", the mr relation shows the typical @xmath101 behavior of a self bound star at low masses where gravity plays no important role @xcite .",
    "it is only somewhat modified at larger masses where gravity terminates the stable range of the mr relation leading to a limiting mass ( mass of the most massive star of a mr relation ) . as already found in @xcite , we see that medium effects have only a slight influence on the mr relation of a pure sqm star .",
    "this situation changes drasticly if we look at the hybrid star results on the right hand side of fig.[rm1 ] ( @xmath102 km ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath10 , the mr relation approaches the curve of the pure hadron star ( denoted by h ) .",
    "since the eos gets stiffer with increasing @xmath10 the eos can support a larger limiting mass with a larger corresponding radius . from the two different shaded regions denoted by qc ( qp core ) and",
    "mc ( mp core ) we can see whether the corresponding central energy density @xmath89 of a point on a particular mr relation is sufficient to bear a qc ( @xmath89 has to be larger as the @xmath87 transition density ) or a mc .",
    "the compact qc stars are located in the small vicinity of @xmath103 and @xmath104 km just below the limiting mass .",
    "the top point of the qc region is reached if the ( with @xmath10 ) decreasing @xmath97 gets equal to the increasing @xmath87 transition density .",
    "this is the case for @xmath105 . at higher @xmath10 ,",
    "the limiting mass of the sequence is reached before the central density is sufficient to develop a qc ( see e.g. g3 ) .",
    "let us now follow e.g. the mr relation for @xmath95 ( g2 ) from low to high central energy densities @xmath89 .",
    "at very low @xmath89 ( @xmath106 , compare fig .",
    "[ eos]a ) the g2 curve corresponds to the h curve ( @xmath107 km ) .",
    "the corresponding star is a complete hadronic star . with increasing @xmath89 the star develops a mc and the mass is increasing while the radius is decreasing .",
    "at @xmath108 ( compare fig .  [",
    "eos]b ) the central density is sufficient to bear a pure qp in the center of the star and we enter the qc region .",
    "finally , the limiting mass of the g2 curve is reached at @xmath109 .",
    "we see that the largest parts of the mr relation correspond to stars possessing a mc .",
    "only a small range of mass and radii corresponds to a qc star .    to discuss the radii of the stars and the extent of the quark and mixed cores in detail , we assume a canonical mass of @xmath110 . from fig.[rm1 ] we see that with increasing @xmath10 the radius increases from originally @xmath104 km to @xmath111 km .",
    "such star possesses a qc at small radii below @xmath112 km , a mc at larger radii and a pure hp at @xmath113 km ( h ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that with increasing @xmath10 the eos gets stiffer owing to a gradually growing impact of the hadronic part of the eos ( fig .",
    "[ eos]a ) .",
    "we can see , that inside such a typical star a qc or a mc is able to exist over a wide range of coupling constants from @xmath30 to @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "as already discussed , this behavior becomes clear from the only slight influence of @xmath10 on the @xmath79 transition density .",
    "in all this quantitative discussions we have of course to keep in mind that the particular values of mass and radius obviously depend on the particular choice of the hadronic eos . nevertheless , we expect that by using a softer hadronic eos ( e.g. a compression modulus of @xmath116 mev ) a similar influence of medium effects should be found if we also soften the quark matter eos by use of an appropriately changed bag constant .",

    "the different shells correspond to the quark phase ( qp ) , mixed phase ( mp ) and hadronic phase ( hp ) .",
    "we find that a small coupling constant of @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) is able to shrink the radius of the pure qp core from @xmath120 km ( with neglected medium effects , fig .",

    "one could say that in a wide range of @xmath10 ( @xmath85 ) medium effects are not able to displace the qp in favor of a pure hp .",
    "the essential effect is the transformation of the pure qp into a mp of quark and hadronic matter which therefore dominates the interior of the star .",

    "since there are no clear results for the running coupling at finite temperature or density we take the zero density result ( [ rc ] ) and replace @xmath125 by the average three - momentum in quark matter @xmath128 for every quark chemical potential @xmath11 .",
    "the quark chemical potential is typically in the range of @xmath129 mev which corresponds to @xmath130 for @xmath131 mev and @xmath132 for @xmath133 mev .",
    "we end up with a density dependent running coupling @xmath134 reflecting the behavior of asymptotic freedom .",
    "[ rm2 ] shows the resulting mr relation using the running coupling constant ( [ rc ] ) at various qcd scale parameters @xmath35 .",
    "again , for comparison we show the pure qp results ( strange star ) on the left hand side ( @xmath100 km ) of fig .",
    "[ rm2 ] , where we do not allow the quark phase to transform into hadronic matter .",
    "the mr relation does not seem to be very sensitive to a change of @xmath35 from @xmath131mev ( l1 ) to @xmath133mev ( l3 ) .",
    "this is depicted by the gray area . comparing the @xmath30 relation ( g0 ) with the running coupling results ( l1-l3 )",
    "we see that there is again only a slight influence of medium effects on a pure qp star @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to note , that the running coupling leads to a slightly smaller critical mass compared to the @xmath68 result in fig .",
    "this holds despite the fact that @xmath134 does never exceed values of @xmath135 and should therefore naively lead to higher masses . the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ rm2 ] ( @xmath102 km ) shows the corresponding hybrid star results .",
    "again , we show the mr relation with neglected medium effects ( g0 ) and the relation for the pure hadron star ( h ) .",
    "the running coupling results are located in a relatively small band just below the pure hadronic solution . at least at our particular choice of model parameters",
    ", it should be difficult to distinguish between hybrid stars and pure hadronic stars by observation of the mr - characteristics of neutron stars only .",
    "however , this situation can change if lower bag constants are taken @xcite . in this context",
    "see also @xcite",
    ".    comparing fig .",
    "[ rm2 ] with fig .",
    "[ rm1 ] one sees that the running coupling results are similar to the @xmath135 results .",
    "the central densities of the stars below the critical densities are not sufficient to yield a pure quark matter core .",
    "hence , the interior of the stars for @xmath136 km and @xmath35 between and consists of a mixed phase core ( mc , shaded region ) .",
    "this is depicted for a canonical star in fig .",
    "one sees , that the structure of the stars is only slightly sensitive to a change of @xmath35 . for ( fig .",
    "[ r2]b ) we find a star ( @xmath137 km ) possessing a mixed core radius of . in this case",
    ", at least half of the mass of the star is found in its mixed phase .",
    "we have investigated the gross structure of non - rotating pure strange quark matter and hybrid stars using the effective mass bag model @xcite for the description of the quark matter eos .",
    "this model is based on the quasi - particle picture where the quarks acquire medium - dependent effective quark masses generated by the interaction of the quarks with the other quarks of the system .",
    "we found that medium effects described by this model and parameterized by the strong coupling constant @xmath10 reduce the extent of a pure quark matter phase in the interior of a hybrid star significantly in favor of a mixed phase .",
    "for example , the radius of the quark matter core ( without medium effects ) of originally ( see fig .  [",
    "r]a ) is halved at ( , fig .",
    "[ r]c ) and is vanished completely at @xmath95 ( , fig .",
    "[ r]d ) . at the same time , the hadronic surface of initial thickness is only increased to ( fig .",
    "so we found that the basic influence of medium effects on the gross structure of hybrid stars is the reduction of a pure quark matter phase in favor of a mixed phase .",
    "for a wide range of the coupling constant ( @xmath85 , @xmath139 ) quark matter is present in the dense interior of the star at least as a mixed phase of quark and hadronic matter .",
    "these results are confirmed by the investigation taking into account a running coupling constant .",
    "there we also end up with a hybrid star dominated by its mixed phase ( fig .",
    "our findings support the importance of the investigation of the complex structure of mixed phases .",
