    "in a linear collider , the strong beam - beam interaction generates significant beamstrahlung . for the high - energy physics experiment to make optimal use of the luminosity , it is important to know the luminosity spectrum",
    ". this is done in the nlc design by measuring the energy spectrum of the disrupted beam in the beam extraction line which transports the beam from the ip to the beam dump .    the present design of the nlc extraction line optics  @xcite is shown in fig .  [ beta ] , where the beam travels from the ip ( on the left ) to the dump .",
    "the optics contains two multi - quadrupole systems , where the first system performs a point - to - point focusing from the ip to a secondary focus ( sf ) , and the second system generates a parallel beam at the dump . between the two quadrupole sets there is a symmetric four bend chicane generating 2  cm displacement and dispersion at the sf .    to accurately measure the energy spectrum of the disrupted beam , the dispersive beam size",
    "@xmath1 should be large compared to the betatron beam size @xmath2 .",
    "the original optics was designed with the horizontal chicane as shown in fig .",
    "[ beta ] , but vertical bends may be used as suggested by k.  kubo of kek  @xcite to improve the resolution .",
    "the on - energy @xmath0 functions at the sf can be derived from the ip @xmath3 values and linear matrix @xmath4 between ip and sf :    @xmath5    in this study , we used one particular set of the nlc beam parameters  @xcite listed in table  1 .",
    "these parameters correspond to the disrupted 0.5  tev beam at the ip .",
    "the beam disruption occurs in the collision and significantly increases the beam divergence , emittance and energy spread .",
    "the disrupted distribution at the ip was obtained using guinea  pig code  @xcite , and the corresponding emittance and lattice functions were reconstructed from this distribution as shown in table  1 .    according to eq .",
    "[ eq - beta ] and table  1 , for a fixed 2  cm dispersion , optics with the vertical chicane provides a larger ratio of the dispersion to the same plane betatron size at the sf , and therefore should result in better accuracy in the energy spectrum measurement .",
    "note , that @xmath6 at sf can grow significantly with @xmath7 due to the shift of @xmath0 waist .",
    "below we compare tracking and measurement simulations for the extraction line with the horizontal and vertical 2  cm chicane .",

    "the guinea  pig code was used to generate @xmath8 macro - particles to represent the disrupted distribution at the ip . as shown in fig .",
    "[ dndp - ip ] , this distribution has a huge energy spread .",
    "the disrupted beam then was tracked to the secondary focus using dimad .",
    "the small betatron beam size and non - zero dispersion at the sf result in a significant correlation between a particle transverse position @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 for vertical @xmath11 ) and energy .",
    "this makes it possible to reconstruct the beam energy spectrum based on the beam profile measurement at the secondary focus .",
    "neglecting synchrotron radiation , a particle coming into chicane on axis will have a transverse deflection    @xmath12    at the secondary focus .",
    "equation  [ eq - x ] can be used to estimate the particle energy deviation @xmath7 based on measured @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) and known @xmath11 at the secondary focus :    @xmath13    using eq .",
    "[ eq - delta ] , one can also convert measured beam profile @xmath14 into the energy spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "equation  [ eq - delta ] is only correct if @xmath7 is constant and the deflections are caused entirely by dispersion . in reality , several other factors contribute to particle position at the secondary focus :    * betatron motion @xmath16 . *",
    "synchrotron radiation causing random energy loss .",
    "* quadrupole misalignment and bending field errors . *",
    "incoming beam offsets @xmath17 , @xmath18 at the ip .",
    "measurement errors have to be taken into account as well . denoting",
    "the above contributions as @xmath19 , particle deflection at the sf can be expressed as @xmath20 .",
    "clearly , an accurate estimate of @xmath7 in eq .  [ eq - delta ] requires that @xmath21 .      to verify the actual dependence of particle positions on energy , the disrupted beam of @xmath8 particles was tracked from ip to sf .",
    "the simulation included synchrotron radiation effects , but no magnet errors were used .",
    "the resultant @xmath9 and @xmath10 distributions versus @xmath7 at the sf are shown in fig .",
    "[ p1-xy ] for 2  cm horizontal and vertical chicane , respectively .",

    "[ eq - x ] , and @xmath22 is the initial energy error at the ip . note that synchrotron radiation between ip and sf reduces average particle @xmath7 at the sf by @xmath23 compared to ip @xmath7 .     and @xmath10 distributions vs. @xmath7 at the sf for horizontal and vertical chicane , respectively.,width=302 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ p1-xy ] , the particle @xmath19 spread versus @xmath7 is wider in optics with the horizontal chicane due to a larger @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the reconstruction of beam energy spectrum based on beam profile measurement should be more accurate with the vertical chicane where the dispersive contribution ( eq .",

    "the energy resolution can be also examined using analysis suggested by kubo  @xcite . in this method ,",

    "[ ellpsx ] and  [ ellpsy ] show these slices at different @xmath7 in the form of one sigma ellipses on the @xmath9-@xmath10 plane . clearly , the resolution between the slices is better in the vertical chicane optics .",

    "[ ellpsx ] and  [ ellpsy ] is the initial ip @xmath7 .",
    "synchrotron radiation randomly reduces the energy which distorts particle deflections at the sf , but relatively it affects more the particles with @xmath25 .",
    "this results in a disproportionally wide ellipse in the direction of dispersion at @xmath26 .",
    "this effect is negligible for @xmath27 .",
    "further analysis  @xcite shows that the ellipse size at sf is approximately proportional to @xmath28 , which can be interpreted as @xmath29 , and that this dependence mostly comes from the shift of @xmath6 waist .",
    "analysis of the ellipse size and position shows that the ratio of an average particle displacement at sf to the beam size as a function of @xmath7 is almost a factor of 3 larger with the vertical dispersion , and therefore is better for energy resolution .      in the simulation",
    ", the beam profile measurement at the secondary focus was done using 50  @xmath30 m steps over the range of 25  mm in the direction of dispersion to simulate a wire scanner .",
    "the particles were collected for each of the 50  @xmath30 m bins ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) , and the beam profile histogram @xmath14 was generated , where @xmath31 is the number of particles per bin .",
    "the range beyond 25  mm was not considered due to low statistics , and no measurement errors were included .",
    "the beam energy spectrum @xmath15 can be obtained from the @xmath14 profile by converting the @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) bins into @xmath7 bins . according to eq .",
    "[ eq - delta ] , the width of @xmath7-bin varies with @xmath9 as    @xmath32    where @xmath33",
    "@xmath30 m is the @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) bin width . at 2  cm dispersion ,",
    "the @xmath34 width gradually reduces from 0.25% at @xmath35 to 0.05% at -25  mm . to avoid dependence on the bin width , we normalized @xmath15 to the corresponding width @xmath34 . for a more general result , we also normalized @xmath15 to the total number of particles @xmath36 in the histogram .",
    "the resultant energy distribution @xmath37 was compared with the initial spectrum at the ip .",
    "both histograms are shown in fig .",
    "[ dndp - l ] for the horizontal and vertical chicane , where the blue line ( darker shade ) is for the original ip spectrum and the green line for the `` measured '' spectrum at sf . the @xmath7 range in fig .",
    "[ dndp - l ] is limited at about @xmath38 due to 25  mm range used in the beam profile measurement .",
    "comparison of the histograms in fig .",
    "[ dndp - l ] shows that optics with the vertical chicane provides a more accurate reconstruction of the initial ip energy spectrum .",
    "a closer view shows that the vertical measurement even reproduces the incoming double peak profile near @xmath26 , while the horizontal histogram is not accurate in this range . in the horizontal spectrum",
    ", there are some particles in @xmath39 range that are not present in the initial ip distribution .",
