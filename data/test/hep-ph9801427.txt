    "in this talk , we present a new equilibration scenario , which emerges out of the initially gluon dominated hot gluon and progressively gains importance in time , this is the scenario of the increasingly strongly interacting parton plasma ( isipp ) . the new scenario arises out of the previously neglected running of the coupling . in high energy nuclear collisions ,",
    "the interactions in the early stage are pretty hard , so perturbative qcd is applicable .",
    "it is common therefore to choose a small _ fixed _ coupling of @xmath0 , with @xmath1200 mev , this corresponds to a _ fixed _ average momentum transfer of 2 gev .",
    "now for a very typical interaction , a simple t - channel exchange for parton 1 and 2 with 4-momenta @xmath2 and @xmath3 and final parton 3 and 4 with 4-momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , the momentum transfer @xmath6 would be bounded between @xmath7 .",
    "for very typical partons , the upper limit would be given by @xmath8 , essentially the squared of the average parton energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that the time evolution of @xmath9 in a plasma time - evolved with a fixed @xmath0 at lhc and at rhic energies .",
    "the change of @xmath9 from the beginning to the end of the evolution is a decrease of at least 1 gev and nearly 2 gev at lhc .",
    "so the average momentum transfer @xmath10 in the system will decrease in time .",
    "this leads to an increase in the strength of the interactions and the interactions in the parton plasma will become stronger and stronger as the system evolves .",
    "this is the origin of the new scenario of isipp . in the following ,",
    "we discuss but not show , due to lack of space , the effects on equilibration of the parton plasma in the new scenario .",
    "we show that the parton plasma is a special kind of many - body system unlike ordinary matter and is probably unique .",
    "to end , we have three news to report on three different particle productions .",
    "by combining boltzmann equation with the relaxation time approximation for the collision terms , c(p , ) = - [ eq : relax ] and construction of the latter again explicitly from qcd matrix elements of the simplest elastic and inelastic interactions , we can solve for the distribution function @xmath11 and hence find out the time evolution of the parton plasma .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite for a plasma with fixed interaction strength . for isipp",
    ", one must take into account also the decrease of the average energy of the system so this is accompanished by using @xmath12 , a not too unreasonable choice , and inserting this into the one - loop running coupling formula to obtain a time - dependent @xmath13 . with this approach",
    ", we found that both chemical and kinetic equilibration of quarks and gluons in the plasma are speeded up but only for quark and antiquark are there any improvements @xcite towards the end of the time evolution .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for details . but still viewed on the whole , the equilibration of the system is faster and improved .",
    "the only drawback in the time evolution of the system is the more rapid cooling and hence shortened duration of the parton phase due to energy sharing from enhanced particle creation and longitudinal expansion .",
    "this reduction when going from the standard plasma to isipp is rather large .",
    "this is determined by the moment when the estimated parton temperatures reach @xmath14 mev , the end point of the time evolution .",
    "the reduction at lhc is as much as 5.0 fm / c and 3.5 fm / c at rhic .",
    "these are the main effects on equilibration in isipp .",
    "we show in this section that the parton plasma is a special kind of many - body system . the quantity that allows us to reveal the secret of the parton plasma is the collision time @xmath15 as appeared in .",
    "the inverse of this quantity measures the net interaction rate which is the difference between the rate of the collisions going forward and backward .",
    "as the plasma is being driven out of equilibrium , this difference of the collision rate must increase , which is precisely what going out of equilibrium means .",
    "so the net reaction rate must go up and @xmath15 must decrease when the system is going out of equilibrium .",
    "when the system is in equilibrium , detail balance means the difference of the collision rate is zero .",
    "so when the system approaches equilibrium , the net rate must go down and @xmath15 must therefore increase .",
    "so for our situation , @xmath15 must first decrease , makes a turn and increases again .    -0.80",
    "cm    -0.50 cm in , we show the collision times for quark and gluon at rhic for various fixed couplings and for isipp .",
    "as can be seen , for the plasmas with fixed coupling , the behaviour of @xmath15 follows what we have just described , but for isipp , the @xmath15 s tend to continue to decrease with time .",
    "this decrease is clearly of a different type from the initial drop when the plasma is being driven out of equilibrium . since @xmath15 s for isipp are not rising in the later stage in general , it seems to mean that the plasma is not equilibrating .",
    "this clearly contradicts what we have already said about isipp in sec .",
    "[ sec : equil ] .",
    "what is happening is , in fact , in the above difference of collision rate , a power of @xmath13 can be extracted out as a prefactor , the increasing coupling can therefore compensate for the decrease in the difference as equilibrium is approached .",
    "the result is , equilibration proceeds faster and faster in isipp whereas , in ordinary many - body system , it is slower and slower .",
    "this is a new physics of the parton plasma that , as far as we know , has never been revealed before , which gives the isipp a unique status as a many - body system .",
    "when we go from the standard parton plasma to isipp , there are two categories of effects that make the difference in particle production .",
    "they are the direct and indirect effects @xcite .",
    "the former is where qcd has at least a partial role to play in the production process and hence there will be explicit dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "the latters are where the coupling effects first act on the time evolution of the system which then get passed onto the production process .",
    "the reduced duration of the parton phase already mentioned and enhanced or reduced parton densities @xcite are examples of the latter .",
    "the first is of importance for particle production because of the need to integrate over spacetime history of the collisions and the second is obvious .",
    "we consider 3 types of particle production and we only show the @xmath16 or invariant mass @xmath17 distributions at lhc .    -1.0 cm    -0.70 cm    * first news  dilepton production + at leading order , this is only subject to indirect effects .",
    "as seen in , reduced production time is more important than enhanced fermion densities and therefore the dilepton production in isipp is suppressed .",
    "* second news  photon production + photon production comes from compton and annihilation contribution .",
    "this time both direct and indirect effects are at work .",
    "photon production plot in shows that negative and positive direct and indirect effects largely cancel out each other so the @xmath16 distribution remains essentially unchanged .",
    "* third news  open charm production + this process is not subject to direct effect , contrary to appearance , because this is a hard process and is therefore at a different scale , in general , from that for equilibration @xcite .",
    "as seen in , the total yield is essentially the same in isipp over the standard plasma .",
    "the ability of open charm as a probe is therefore unaffected .",
    "we have pointed out that the isipp scenario is a necessary stage in heavy ion collisions and equilibration is faster and improved as a result but the parton phase is shortened .",
    "the approach towards equilibrium for isipp is different from other many - body system and contains new physics .",
    "particle productions at leading order in the new plasma have mixed results . in view of the increasing coupling ,",
    "higher orders are more important for electromagnetic radiations .",
    "there is even a chance of enhancement .",
    "we have not mentioned the effect of reduction of generated entropy in isipp @xcite , this will lead to a shortened mixed phase in the case of a first order phase transition and therefore reduced final hadron multiplicity and hadron gas density and therefore reduced hadronic signals .",
    "so enhanced partonic but reduced hadronic signals , for example the electromagnetic ones suggested here , that follow from isipp , if confirmed , would contribute positively towards the possibility of having the quark - gluon plasma outshining hadronic matter ."
