    "the standard - model extension ( sme ) provides a general field - theoretic framework for studying lorentz violation@xcite , including rotation - invariance violation . to highlight the basic ideas of lorentz - symmetry breaking",
    ", we consider rotation - invariance violation in newton s second law:@xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a symmetric direction - dependent inertial mass ( we consider conventional gravitational mass ) .",
    "this yields a valid and more general form that newton himself could have chosen .",
    "our effective inertial mass can be generated as a low - energy limit of the sme:@xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a coefficient for lorentz violation found in the fermion sector , taken as symmetric .",
    "it is depicted with background diamonds in fig .  1 .",
    "a similar construction can also be found associated with other sme coefficients for lorentz violation . @xcite    using a block on an inclined plane",
    ", we show that observer rotation invariance holds , while a particle rotation changes the experiment s outcome , violating lorentz symmetry .",
    "examine a block on an inclined plane devoid of friction .",
    "the @xmath4-axis points down the plane while the @xmath5-axis is perpendicular to the surface as shown in the left - hand diagram of fig .  1 .",
    "let the block s effective inertial mass be diagonal : @xmath6 solving for the particle s acceleration under the constraint @xmath7 yields @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the acceleration down the ramp .",
    "the only difference here from the conventional problem is the presence of @xmath10 .",
    "qualitatively , the motion is down the plane with constant acceleration , as in the absence of lorentz violation .",
    "perform an observer rotation on the original experiment ; that is , consider the same problem in new coordinates as shown in the left - hand diagram of fig .  1 . here , @xmath11 is the mass in the new coordinates obtained via @xmath12 , @xmath13 being a rotation matrix .",
    "components are related by , for example , @xmath14 again solving , we find up to @xmath15 the components @xmath16 however , the acceleration is again along the ramp with the magnitude found in eq .",

    "a particle rotation of the original system leaves the mass matrix as in eq .  , but alters the direction of the gravitational field relative to the background as shown in the right - hand diagram of fig .  1 .",
    "this produces an observably different acceleration .",
    "solving for the motion of the particle subject to the constraint yields @xmath21 here the component along the ramp is @xmath22 which is different from the first cases , revealing observable lorentz violation ."
