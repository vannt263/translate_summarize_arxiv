    "the central engines of powerful type i active galactic nuclei ( agns ) contain gas that is moving at extreme velocities , apparent from their broad emission lines ( bels ) and , in the case of broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars , in blueshifted absorption troughs .",
    "these spectral features arise from compact gas flows close to the accretion disk , apparent from the presence of high ionization lines and size scales from reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "these compact flows are probably the origin of larger - scale outflows ( e.g. chelouche & netzer 2005 ; crenshaw & kraemer 2007 ; storchi - bergmann 2010 ) and result in feedback that is believed to be important on many scales , regulating supermassive black hole ( smbh ) fueling , quenching star formation , and so driving galaxy - smbh coevolution ( e.g. silk and rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; sommerville et al . 2008 ; zubovas & king 2012 ) as well as influencing the intergalactic and intracluster medium and affecting galaxy and large - scale structure formation ( e.g. scannapieco & oh 2004 ; rafferty , mcnamara & nulsen 2006 ; sommerville et al . 2008 ; fabjan et al . 2010 ; wang 2015 ) . yet despite the importance of these processes , the connection between compact and large - scale outflows is not understood . in the case of the broad emission line region ( belr ) , even the basic kinematics are unclear ; independent reverberation mapping results support outflow , inflow , and orbital motion @xcite , and microlensing results have been consistent with both virial belrs @xcite and with more complex , multi - component flows @xcite .",
    "bal quasars offer perhaps the clearest evidence of nuclear outflows in agns .",
    "approximately 15% of optically selected quasars exhibit high velocity , blueshifted absorption features @xcite .",
    "the outflows responsible for these features may be common to most quasars if this 15% represents a special line of sight to outflows with a similar covering factor @xcite , or a particular phase in the lifecycle of quasars .",
    "an accurate measurement of the absorption profile of a bal quasar would go a long way to revealing the kinematics of these outflows , however this measurement is complicated by the fact that their intrinsic absorption profile can not be recovered without knowing the shape of the underlying bel that it absorbs .",
    "these bel profiles can vary dramatically between quasars , and in the case of bal quasars may be strongly affected by a biased viewing angle .",
    "the gravitationally lensed bal quasar h1413 + 117 ( the cloverleaf ; magain et al .",
    "1988 ) offers a unique opportunity to simultaneously study both bel and bal flows in the same source .",
    "the four lensed images of this @xmath1 quasar exhibit deep bal features in high - ionization lines , as well as low - ionization absorption in aliii , making it a lobal quasar .",
    "significant microlensing has been observed in h1413 + 117 over the past 15 years @xcite . in microlensing ,",
    "substructure within the foreground lensing galaxy causes changes in the magnification of individual lensed images .",
    "the degree of microlensing depends on size of lensed region , and in the case of h1413 + 117 this has resulted enhanced magnification in the continuum in lensed image d compared to the broad emission lines in this component .    given a model of the microlensing magnification of the lens system",
    ", these differential magnifications can be used to derive size constraints of emission regions .",
    "this approach has been used to contrain accretion disk size and temperature gradient in several lensed quasars ( e.g. kochanek et al .",

    "2015 ) , including in h1413 + 117 by @xcite ( hereafter h10 )",
    ". it has also provided constraints on belr size @xcite and kinematics @xcite in a number of quasars , however no such constraints have been derived for the belr of h1413 + 117 .",
    "another novel use of microlensing takes advantage of differential magnifications between lensed images to algebraically decompose the spectral contributions of different physical regions within the quasar @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter a90 ) and h10 apply this technique to h1413 + 117 , shedding light on the true shape of the broad absorption profile , and in the case of h10 decomposing into microlensed and non - microlensed components which reveal substructure in each component and may point to a two - component outflow comprising a polar outflow and equatorial disk - wind .",
    "in this paper we present new gemini north gmos integral field spectroscopy of h1413 + 117 , and based on the strong microlensing observed in lensed image d we derive new statistical size constraints on the belr .",
    "we also present a new spectral decomposition , deriving belr and continuum components , as well as the intrinsic bal profiles for nv , siiv , civ , and aliii .    in section [ obs ]",

    "we used calibration files taken as part of the standard gemini facility calibration unit ( gcal ) suite .",
    "mostly , the standard gmos ifu reduction procedure was followed for overscan subtraction and trimming , bias subtraction , flat fielding and response correction , arc calibration , fiber extraction , sky subtraction , flux calibration , cube reconstruction with atmospheric dispersion correction .",
    "additionally , we corrected the gcal flat and the twilight flat for scattered light by fitting a surface to residual light detected between the fiber bundles .",
    "that correction was not necessary for the science observations , the signal being too weak to generate any significant scattered light .",
    "the cosmic rays were corrected before extraction with la - cosmic @xcite , followed , after extraction , by a floor and ceiling masking of remaining extreme hits . the calibrated cubes for each science observation were aligned and combined with a customized version of the pyfu software package .",

    "we perform this extraction using the method described in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for a detailed description , however in short : relative lensed image fluxes at each wavelength bin are determined by least - squares fitting of reconstructed point spread functions ( psfs ) .",
    "a separate psf is determined for each 100 - wide spectral bin .",
    "each given psf is initially estimated using carefully - masked fragments of the ifu frame ( stacked over 100 ) , and are iteratively improved with a series of least - squares minimizations of each frame .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows the extracted spectra of the four quasar images .",
    "we see distinct broad emission lines for ly@xmath5 , nv , oi , cii , siiv , civ , and ciii ] as well as prominent iron emisison features at @xmath01600 - 1800 .",
    "emission from heii and aliii is also apparent , blended with iron and ciii ] respectively .",
    "clear redshifted broad absorption troughs are seen for ly@xmath5/nv , siiv , civ , and aliii .",
    "gravitational lensing is achromatic , and so in the absence of microlensing , differential extinction , or time - dependent spectral variation , the spectra of lensed images of a multiply - imaged quasar are identical modulo a scaling factor .",
    "microlensing is typified by a difference in the magnification of one or more lensed images compared to the time - averaged magnification for that lensed image ( which we will refer to as the macrolens magnification , or just macro - magnification ) .",
    "_ differential microlensing _ is characterized by magnifications that vary between different emission regions , resulting in a change in the shape of the spectrum of the affected lensed image .",
    "differential microlensing is sensitive to emission region size and projected location , is frequently seen between bels and continua , and also often shows wavelength dependence within these features .",
    "spectral variability coupled with different light travel times can result in spectral differences between lensed images . in the case of h1413 + 117",
    "the time delay is potentially significant , estimated , for example at 23.4@xmath64 days between images a and d @xcite .",
    "this variability can potentially lead to differences in four key observables between lensed images : bal and bel profile shapes , continuum - to - bel flux ratio , and the spectral index of the continuum .",
    "while it is difficult to extricate the differences due to intrinsic variability from those due to microlensing , we can comment on the effect of this on our analysis .",
    "variation in broad absorption and emission line profile shapes would be very difficult to discriminate from microlensing .",
    "fortunately the effect is probably minimal .",
    "as we show in section [ fluxratios ] the bel profiles are identical between lensed images , precluding both differential microlensing and intrinsic variability in the belr spectrum .",
    "it is not so easy to compare bal profiles , however we note that , while this profile has been observed to vary , this variation occurs over months and years , not days ( h10 ) .",
    "as we will see in section [ microlensingbehavior ] we estimate the size of the belr ( and hence also the bal wind ) at @xmath7100 light days , and so their intrinsic variation timescales should be significantly longer than the time delay .",
    "variation in the continuum - to - bel ratio between lensed images can not be ruled out , and we do see significant variation in this ratio , which we attribute to microlensing because it is consistent with the microlensing behavior of the lens in recent years .",
    "in section [ algebra ] we use this difference in continuum - to - bel ratios to decompose the spectrum into intrinsic components .",
    "it s important to note that for the purpose of the decomposition of spectral components , it does not matter why this ratio varies between images  whether by microlensing or intrinsic variability  the decomposition is still valid as long as the bels do nt show wavelength - dependent variations .",
    "variation in the slope of the continuum could also be due to intrinsic variability , and we do indeed observe a difference in slope ( sect .",
    "[ fluxratios ] ) , however we do nt investigate this in detail in this paper .",
    "differential extinction between lensed images will not affect the continuum - to - bel ratios as our measurement of the continuum strength is made at the relevant bel wavelength range .",
    "nor will it significantly affect broad line profiles , which appear identical between lensed images anyway .",
    "differential extinction only affects the continuum slope and ratios between bels , which are not a focus of his work .          to inspect differential microlensing properties of h1413 + 117 we first obtain an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum spectrum for each lensed image by performing a linear fit to regions of the spectrum least affected by emission or absorption ( fig .",
    "[ spec ] shows fits for images a & d ) .",
    "prominent iron emission features force us to choose small windows at rest frame 14201460 , 16851692 , and 17951805 . while the continuum is unlikely to be linear over the full range of this spectrum",
    ", we find that the fit gives a very plausible estimate , particularly redward of the nv line .",
    "subtraction of the fitted continua allow us to measure the average flux ratios across each bel for each lensed image with respect to image a. these ratios and the average flux ratios for the continuum at each line center are given in table  [ fluxratiotable ] .",
    "for the purpose of inspection of the microlensing properties , we find that changing the continuum level and slope by allowing variation of @xmath65% ( the width of the pale gray region surrounding fits in fig .",

    "there was clear differential microlensing across the velocity structure of these broad lines , with magnification ratios varying by @xmath025 - 30% between line center and wings .",
    "the bel magnification ratio approached the highly anomalous continuum magnification ratio at the highest velocities .",
    "our simple model indicated that this trend was consistent with the broad line flow being a keplerian field , and not supporting a pure radiation - driven outflow without a substantial gravitational component .",
    "this differential microlensing signature sharply contrasts the wavelength - independent bel magnification ratios seen in h1413 + 117 ( sect .",

    "this wavelength independence suggests that the belr in h1413 + 117 is large enough to average over fluctuations in the magnification surface .",

    "we compare the expected microlensing behavior of these two quasars as a function of source size .",
    "although the lensing galaxy of h1413 + 117 does not have a confirmed redshift , it is possible to explore plausible microlensing scenarios using estimates from literature : z@xmath9 = 0.94 based on the probability distribution from lens parameters @xcite and supported by the z@xmath10 0.9 photometric redshift of overdensities in the field @xcite ; and z@xmath9 = 1.4 @xcite , that is also comparable to the z @xmath0 1.5 absorption systems in the quasar spectrum @xcite . for the h1413 + 117 lens macro - model we use the convergence and shear estimates of @xcite ( @xmath11 case ) , which are nearly identical to those of @xcite . we assume an 80% smooth matter percentage , consistent with the values estimated in other lenses where the line of sight does not pass through the galactic core @xcite . for q2237 + 0305",
    "we use the macro - model of @xcite , and trott & wayth ( priv .",

    "lensed images are clustered around the star - dominated galactic core and microlensing is consistent with a 0% smooth matter percentage @xcite , which we employ here .",

    "emission region surface brightness distributions are simulated with gaussian profiles whose half - light radii represent emission region sizes . note that except in the case of very strong microlensing events , half - light radius rather than the detailed surface brightness distribution governs microlensing properties @xcite .",
    "a pair of random locations on gaussian - convolved magnification maps ( one map for each of a pair of lensed images ) yields a possible magnification ratio between those lensed images . by varying half - light radius and location we",

    "magnification ratios are normalized to unity at the macro - model magnification ratios ( the large - scale average ratios ) .",
    "these figures , which we will refer to as _ convergence plots _ , illustrate two important points :    \\1 ) as expected , magnification ratios will converge on the macro - model ratios above a certain emission region size ( the _ convergence size _ ) .",
    "we see that for h1413 + 117 ( top 2 panels ) the d / a convergence size is @xmath14  m ( @xmath020 light days ) for both the @xmath15 and @xmath16 cases . if the wavelength independence that we observe in the bel magnification ratios ( sect .",
    "[ fluxratios ] ) is due to such convergence , then this gives us an approximate lower limit on the size of observed belrs . in the case of q2237 + 0305 ( panel 3 )",
    "the convergence of the b / a magnification ratio does not occur until significantly greater than @xmath17  m , beyond the limit of our simulated magnification maps , and so the observation of differential microlensing across the full velocity width of its belr is not surprising .",

    "most simulated tracks are relatively flat below @xmath18  m. there is an intermediate range over which all tracks converge on the macro - model ratios  the _ convergence range_. the convergence range spans @xmath18  m to @xmath14  m for h1413 + 117 , and in it we see strong size dependence of magnification ratios , and here the only flat tracks are those already close to the macro - model ratio .",
    "the interpretation of this behavior is straightforward : the small - scale flatness seen the convergence plots occurs when a small emission region falls in relatively featureless regions between strong magnification gradients in the caustic network . as size increases into the convergence range ,",
    "our larger source is beginning to overlap high or low magnification structures in the caustic network , resulting in size - dependent , differential microlensing . when the emission region is large enough to sample many such structures , tracks again flatten at the macro - model magnification ratio .",
    "the magnification ratios of the civ and ciii ] bels in h1413 + 117 vary by less than 5% across the unabsorbed component of their velocity structure ( sect .",
    "[ fluxratios ] ) , and so must reside on a `` flat '' region of a convergence plot track .",
    "we can place more formal constraints on the possible sizes of these emission regions by determining the number of tracks that show similar flatness over a given size range .",
    "we conservatively assume that the broad line gas flow spans a size range of 0.5 dex across its entire velocity structure .",
    "in fact the belr probably spans a larger range , but choosing a smaller range yields more tracks within our flatness constraint , and so produces weaker ( more conservative ) size constraints .",

    "it is important to note that h10 also observe this size - independent microlensing of the belr at a different epoch , greatly decreasing the probability that the belr is in the @xmath18  m to @xmath21  m range . for a reasonable probability of observing size independent magnification ratios in the belr of h1413 + 117 in two independent epochs",
    ", the belr probably needs to be larger than @xmath17  m ( @xmath040 light days ) , and any significantly luminous component likely arises well above the convergence size of @xmath14  m ( @xmath020 light days ) .",
    "these constraints are for the @xmath15 case ; larger values of @xmath25 push us to larger belr sizes .",
    "we can also consider the possibility that the entire belr is emitting at sizes smaller than @xmath18  m ( @xmath04 light days ) .",
    "we think this unlikely for two related reasons : 1 ) our observations and those of h10 show wavelength - dependent differential microlensing in the continuum d / a ratio , which precludes flat tracks at small size needed for size independence in the bel magnification ratios ; 2 ) for a high likelihood of size independence at small scales at two epochs , the emission region must be closer to a few times @xmath26  m , which is approaching the scale of the accretion disk ( see sect .",

    "we measure the civ fwhm of 3,400  km / s based on the unabsorbed , red side .",
    "note that the intrinsic civ bel is either symmetric or shows a blue excess , as discussed in section [ belrcomp ] , and so the correct fwhm and corresponding black hole mass may be a larger .    in order to obtain an upper limit estimate on the size of the accretion disk in h1413 + 117 we assume a shakura - sunyaev thin disk @xcite with a @xmath35  m@xmath33 non - rotating black hole accreting at the eddington limit , and observed at 150  nm .",
    "this yields a source half - light radius of @xmath36  m , shown in figure  [ ratiovssize ] . for our black hole mass estimate of @xmath32  m@xmath33 and the same accretion parameters the 150  nm source size is @xmath37  m. based on differential microlensing across the continuum , h10 estimate a continuum source size of @xmath38  m.",
    "the accretion disk for both quasars is much smaller than the convergence range . for h1413",
    "+ 113 both size - dependent and size - independent magnification ratios are reasonably common at small radii , and it s not surprising that the continuum shows some differential magnification in both our observations and those of h10 .",
    "this is also true for q2237 + 0305 , however size dependence occurs less frequently at these small size scales , in @xmath020% of cases .",
    "the d / a magnification ratio in the h1413 + 117 continuum tends towards the average d / a bel ratio towards longer continuum wavelengths ( although never getting close to the bel ratio ) , and so it s tempting to interpret this as the accretion disk becoming large enough to start averaging over causic structures and hence approach the macro - model magnifications .",
    "however figure [ ratiovssize ] shows that even a large accretion disk is much smaller than the convergence range . in this regime ,",
    "magnfication ratio can have a size dependence that either approaches the macro - model value or moves away from the macro - model value , even if all tracks ultimately converge on the same value .",
    "in short , we can not interpret a trend towards the macro - model magnifications as a reliable proxy for increasing emission region size _ except _ in the convergence range .",

    "of particular interest is the sharp , blueshifted onset of this absorption , which is especially striking in civ .",
    "this sharpness is not ambiguous , and is apparent over the full range of uncertainty in the decomposition ( fig .",
    "[ civdecomp ] , lower ) . while bals with highly blueshifted absorption onsets are sometimes observed ( so - called detached troughs , blueshifted at several thousand km / s ; e.g. turnshek 1987 ) , our decomposition of h1413 + 117",
    "provides the first unambiguous description of a sudden , blueshifted absorption onset that is still within the velocity range of the bel .",
    "the steepness and blueshift of this onset tells us two things : 1 ) the outflow has already accelerated to some degree before either it enters our sightline or it enters the region of efficient absorption within our sightline ; and 2 ) the kinematics of absorbing gas in our sightline is strongly dominated by outflow , not orbital motion .",
    "@xcite intepret highly detached absorption troughs as resulting from sightlines that graze the upper layer of an equitorial outflow , hence missing the vertical base of their wind model where the flow has a small radial component .",
    "@xcite ( h13 ) apply radiative transfer code to their disk - wind model to predict civ bal profiles , also finding that these same grazing sightlines produce a very sharp , blueshifted onset . in these equitorial disk - winds we expect any deeper line of sight ",
    "those passing near the launch region of the wind  to show absorption at low velocities . not only",
    "do they encounter launching gas prior to significant outward acceleration , but they also encounter gas with very high rotational velocities in the vicinity of the accretion disk .",
    "this latter effect is important , as shown by h13 ; at launch , the bal flow shares the keplerian velocity of the accretion disk and so is dominated by rotational motion . if the inner disk is occluded by this gas along our line of sight , and if this gas is significantly absorbing in the vicinity of the accretion disk , then some fraction of the continuum will be absorbed by the component of the orbiting flow that is receding along our sightline , producing partial absorption of the continuum at lower and/or redshifted projected velocities .",
    "on the other hand , even large rotational motion far from the accretion disk will only have a transverse velocity component within our line - of - sight column to the disk .",
    "this argument against a rotational contribution to the line - of - sight velocity is supported by @xcite , who show that , for a spherically expanding outflow , a sharp absorption onset is only expected in cases with small rotational components .",
    "any significant rotation results in a gradual absorption onset .",
    "this same grazing sightline in the h13 model also appears to reproduce the ramped blue edge of the civ absorption trough that we observe in h1413 + 117 .",
    "the models of @xcite show that a ramped increase in transmission at the blue edge indicates a large variation in both velocity and density in the absorbing region along the line of sight , which appears to occur when this line of sight is close to tracing a streamline in the flow .",
    "this is consistent with a line of sight along the upper surface of the wind .",
    "the interpretation of @xcite contradicts this .",
    "they classify sdss bal quasars according to the appearance of siiv and aliii troughs alongside the ubiquitous civ trough , and interpret those containing all three ( h1413 + 117 does , making it a lobal ) as resulting from lines of sight on the underside of the outflow , intersecting the base of the wind .",
    "the argument of the grazing sightline does not explain the different velocity shifts we see in the absorption onset for different line species , which should be the same if caused by our line of sight exiting the outflow .",
    "while ion species with the highest ionization potentials , civ ( 64.5  ev ) and nv ( 97.9  ev ) , have similar @xmath01,500  km / s absorption onsets , the onset for siiv ( 45.1  ev ) is @xmath03,000  km / s and the deeper part of the aliii ( 29.4  ev ) trough starts at @xmath04,500 - 5,000  km / s ( though may show weaker absorption from @xmath02,000  km / s ) .",
    "this increase in absorption onset with diminishing ionization potential may suggest that for siiv and aliii we are in fact seeing very sudden jumps in transition rate as ionizing radiation and/or gas density reach optimal levels as a function of radius and hence outflow velocity .",
    "for example , this may be the radius where it is first possible for `` locally optimized clouds '' @xcite to form due to the diminishing ionization parameter .",
    "a combination of the above may be needed to explain the onset of all absorption troughs ; we propose that for civ and the higher ionization nv we are seeing our line of sight exit the outflow near its launch point , while for lower ionization lines we are seeing the onset of favorable absorption conditions further out in the flow . in the ionization / radiative transfer calculations of h13",
    ", high civ fractions are expected at the highest ionization parameters in their luminous benchmark quasar ( m@xmath78  m@xmath33 , eddington ratio = 0.2 ) , and so it is expected that civ absorption should be seen at its inner - most radii .",
    "figures [ decomp ] & [ civdecomp ] ( lower ) shows a plausible bel spectrum , however it should be remembered that this component includes the bal absorption of this broad line emission .",
    "it is not possible to extricate the true absorption profile @xmath79 from the line profiles @xmath80 . in the case of the civ line ( fig .",
    "[ civdecomp ] , lower ) we see a region of near - zero emission in the rest frame 1515 - 1525  range ( @xmath045006400 km / s ) where we might otherwise expect to see broad - line emission  either civ or feii , given the presence of one or both surrounding this region , and the significant iron emission in this wavelength range of the @xcite template .",
    "we take this as evidence of absorption of broad - line emission by the bal wind .",
    "if this black region is due to absorption then we are seeing very high column densities _ and _ very high covering factors for absorption of the civ and/or feii emission at these velocities .",
    "this is very interesting due to the presumably much larger extent of the source of this broad - line emission compared to the continuum  the line - emitting gas is completely enveloped by absorbing gas across the entire belr at these projected velocities .",
    "further evidence of absorption of bel light by the bal wind comes from the significant absorption of ly@xmath5 by the nv trough in this source ( see also turnshek 1987 ) .",
    "while the symmetry of the civ emission in this component resembles that of an unabsorbed bel , it should be remembered that civ very frequently shows a strong blue excess which may be absorbed in this case .",
    "the siiv line shows a sharp drop in flux in its blue wing that also suggests absorption of bel light .",
    "the iron emission template of @xcite shown in these figures provides a good match to several features in the emission line spectrum , and an imperfect match to others .",
    "the complexity and potential variation in iron emission makes a perfect match unlikely , however the scale and shape of these features match the template adequately . as well as natural variation , it is also possible that we are seeing differential microlensing acrosss the iron emission spectrum .",
    "the strong presence of iron features in component @xmath81 implies that some of this emission arises on size scales similar to other bels .",
    "the fact that the iron template provides a reasonable match to the iron emission across the full wavelength range of the belr component ( fig .",

    "the features observed in the civ and siiv troughs of the continuum component ( _ a _ , _ b _ & _ f _ ) indicate regions of reduced absorption in the bal outflow . this may be due to radial fluctuations in overall outflow density and/or relative ion species density due to variations in ionization parameter .",

    "a _ and _ d _ correspond to the same peak in the original spectrum , and so to the same region of diminished absorption .",
    "b _ in the continuum component has no obvious counterpart in the bel component .",

    "the differences observed in the bal profiles between lens images can not be due to differences in the line of sight .",
    "the bal absorption profile affecting the continuum is determined by the region of the bal flow sampled by the column along the line of sight to the accretion disk , and so different lensed images will only experience different absorption if their line - of - sight columns diverge significantly within this outflow . the image separation between images a and d is 118 , which corresponds to a divergence angle of the a and d lines of sight from the source of 066 and 20 for @xmath15 and 1.4 respectively . assuming @xmath16 and a conservatively small accretion disk with half - light radius @xmath26 m ( ss disk with @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , lines of sight have diverged by one half - light radius at @xmath0100 light years .",

    "line - of - sight columns to the belr , assuming 100 light day cross - section , diverge completely at @xmath028,000 ly , and so may be subject to different line - of - sight absorption features both within the host galaxy and in the igm .",
    "this is also true of the continuum , however the continuum will be subject to differences in absorption features from a greater depth within the host galaxy .",
    "these line - of - sight differences do account for the many differences in narrow absorption features observed in our spectra .",
    "@xcite show that these features arise both in the igm and potentially the lensing galaxy , but probably not the host galaxy which has a higher redshift than observed features .",
    "we do nt investigate the absorption features in detail in this paper , however we note that the @xmath87 feii lines ( @xmath88 2344.2 , 2374.5 , 2382.8 ) follow the same behavior in our spectra as observed by @xcite ; it is present in lensed images a and b and absent in c and d. several other features exhibit similar behavior , and we will investigate these in a separate study .",
    "we have presented new spectroscopy of the gravitationally lensed broad absorption line quasar h1413 + 117 using gemini north s gmos ifu .",
    "extracted spectra of the four lensed images reveal that differential microlensing strongly affects the relative magnification of the broad emission lines compared to the continuum in lensed image d , with the continuum in d appearing anomalously bright compared to all other lensed images . lensed images a , b , and c also show small differences in their continuum - to - broad line flux ratios relative to each other .",
    "subtracting a fit to the continuum emission outside the broad emission and absorption regions allows us to determine the wavelength - dependent d / a flux ratios of the broad emission lines .",
    "these flux ratios are flat , indicating no differential microlensing across the velocity structure of the belr .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed to analyze the dependence of the flatness of broad line flux ratios on the the size range spanned by the belr velocity structure .",
    "it was found that belrs with an upper size limit in the @xmath89@xmath17  m range , and spanning 0.5 dex across their velocity structure are very unlikely to produce the observed flat flux ratios .",
    "smaller belrs are also unlikely due to the strong differential magnification observed between broad lines and continuum .",
    "therefore , it is inferred that the belr in h1413 + 117 is significantly larger than @xmath17  m , and produces no significant emission from regions smaller than @xmath14  m , or 20 light days .",
    "we take advantage of the differential magnification between lensed images a and d to algebraically decompose the quasar spectrum into two components : the absorbed broad line spectrum and the absorbed continuum spectrum , and we use the latter to derive intrinsic absorption profiles .",
    "our decomposition leads us to these conclusions :    @xmath90 a sharp , blue - shifted onset of absorption is observed in all prominent bal features in the continuum component . in the case of civ ,",
    "nv , and ly@xmath5 this onset is at @xmath01,500  km / s , which may represent the inner edge of a radial outflow . in the context of typical disk - wind models this would place the onset of bal absorption near its launch point , and so in the vicinity of the accretion disk . in the case of siiv and aliii , which have a larger absorption onsets , we may be seeing increases in absorption efficiency of lower ionization species with distance from the ionizing source .",
    "this sharp onset also indicates that the line - of - sight velocity is dominated by outflow , not rotational motion .",

    "<S> we present new integral field spectroscopy of the gravitationally lensed broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar h1413 + 117 , covering the ultraviolet to visible rest - frame spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> we observe strong microlensing signatures in lensed image d , and we use this microlensing to simultaneously constrain both the broad emission and broad absorption line gas . by modeling the lens system over the range of probable lensing galaxy redshifts and using on a new argument based on the wavelength - independence of the broad line lensing magnifications , we determine that there is no significant broad line emission from smaller than @xmath020 light days . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform spectral decomposition to derive the intrinsic broad emission line ( bel ) and continuum spectrum , subject to bal absorption . </S>",
    "<S> we also reconstruct the intrinsic bal absorption profile , whose features allow us to constrain outflow kinematics in the context of a disk - wind model . </S>",
    "<S> we find a very sharp , blueshifted onset of absorption of 1,500  km / s in both civ and nv that may correspond to an inner edge of a disk - wind s radial outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the lower ionization siiv and aliii have higher - velocity absorption onsets , consistent with a decreasing ionization parameter with radius in an accelerating outflow . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence of strong absorption in the bel component which indicates a high covering factor for absorption over two orders of magnitude in outflow radius . </S>"
