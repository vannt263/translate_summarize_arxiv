    "depending on the value of @xmath4 , these models feature discrete ( @xmath5 , @xmath2 ) or continuous ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) chiral symmetry , possibly broken by the bare mass term @xmath8 . to avoid confusion",
    "we shall refer to the first model as gross - neveu ( gn@xmath9 ) , the 2nd one as nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl@xmath9 ) model . from the point of view of strong interaction physics ,",
    "they are most useful in the t  hooft limit ( @xmath10 ) to which we stick in the following . rather than repeating all the well - known attractive features of these models , we refer the reader to some pertinent review articles @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) is known to possess multi - fermion bound states analogous to baryons or baryonium states in hadron physics .",
    "they were first constructed by dashen , hasslacher and neveu ( dhn ) in the massless gn@xmath9 model @xcite and by shei in the massless njl@xmath9 model @xcite . the semi - classical method developed by these authors",

    ", one solves the first - quantized , time - independent dirac equation @xmath11 for single particle orbits with label @xmath12 subject to self - consistency conditions for scalar and pseudoscalar mean fields , @xmath13 a major challenge arises from the fact that the dirac sea must be included in the sum over occupied states in ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "this problem was solved in refs .",
    "@xcite by inverse scattering methods together with a careful subtraction of bound state and vacuum energies . at about the same time",
    "the proposal was made to solve these models  classically \" , neglecting the dirac sea and including only the discrete valence level @xcite .",
    "this reduces the full problem to a non - linear dirac equation , which has been solved in closed analytical form for both the gn@xmath9 and njl@xmath9 models .",
    "it appeared that the classical fermionic solution was useful for the gn@xmath9 model but completely failed in the njl@xmath9 case @xcite for poorly understood reasons .",
    "the dirac sea also caused considerable difficulties in attempts to base nuclear physics on field theoretic models like the ( @xmath14 ) model @xcite , so that mean field calculations were typically done without the sea .",
    "in the present work we reconsider the role of the dirac sea in multi - fermion bound states of gross - neveu models . from a general field",
    "theoretic point of view , it should be possible to  integrate out \" the dirac sea and derive an effective lagrangian for ( positive energy ) valence fermions only . in the large @xmath0 limit , it would then indeed be sufficient to solve the classical euler - lagrange equation of this effective theory for fermions .",
    "from such a point of view the above mentioned  no - sea \" calculations may be re - interpreted as follows : the authors assumed that the effective lagrangian is the same as the original lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) , except that the bare parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are replaced by an effective mass and coupling constant .",
    "in the course of this paper we will confront this implicit assumption with our results for an effective action derived from the underlying field theory .",
    "let us mention that although the solvable models used here are restricted to 1 + 1 dimensions , the technique applied in deriving the effective lagrangian is not .",
    "it might be useful also in higher dimensional ( mean field type ) theories .",
    "the advantage of developing the methods in the context of gross - neveu models is the fact that the exact bound states are known analytically .",
    "this enables us to test our effective action quantitatively and make sure that the expansion is consistent to a given order in some small parameter .",
    "since the derivation of @xmath17 is not completely straightforward due to the necessity of resummations , this has turned out to be quite helpful indeed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we derive the effective lagrangian for the gn@xmath9 model in the three lowest orders of a systematic expansion valid for small filling fraction and/or large bare fermion mass and check it against the dhn baryon . in sect .",
    "iii we take up the njl@xmath9 model . due to additional complications",
    ", we will content ourselves with the leading order effective action here and test it against the shei bound state .",
    "we end with a short summary and conclusions in sect .  iv .",
    "our aim is to account for the effects of the dirac sea by means of an effective theory of positive energy fermions only .",
    "since we do not use the path integral but work canonically , we first have to explain what we mean by  integrating out the dirac sea \" .",
    "we start with the massless gn@xmath9 model described by the bare lagrangian @xmath18 and focus on the dhn baryons .",
    "they are characterized by a discrete positive energy level occupied with @xmath19 fermions , all negative energy levels being completely filled .",
    "the presence of extra fermions polarizes the dirac sea , distorting the single particle wave functions .",
    "ideally , one would like to fully integrate out the dirac sea .",
    "we have not been able to do this .",
    "anyway , the full effective theory will invariably be non - local and therefore of less practical use .",
    "we therefore look for an expansion parameter which would enable us to derive an  almost local \" effective action , consisting of a polynomial in the chiral condensate @xmath20 and its first few derivatives . from the dhn baryon",
    "we know that for small filling fraction @xmath21 of the valence level , the self - consistent scalar potential @xmath22 differs from the physical ( vacuum ) fermion mass @xmath23 by a weak and slowly varying potential only .",
    "this suggests to use @xmath24 as expansion parameter and to restrict oneself to small filling fraction where the hf potential becomes soft .",
    "the following derivation of the effective action is tailored to the hf approach to which we now turn . in the vacuum ,",
    "a fermion mass is generated dynamically as shown graphically in fig .  1",
    ".    the self - consistent mass can be thought of as the sum over all one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) cactus type diagrams , see fig .  2 .",
    "the ( self - consistent ) tadpole diagram receives contributions from all negative energy occupied states , leading to the gap equation @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 as uv cutoff @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , since the physical fermion mass is a pure manifestation of the dirac sea , it has to be put in by hand into an effective theory as an effective mass term @xmath27 ( from now on the superscript on @xmath17 refers to the number of loops of the self - energy diagram from which it was derived . due to resummations",
    ", it may contain higher loop effects as well . )",
    "let us now turn to the problem of finite fermion number .",
    "the hf approach still has the same basic structure as in fig .  1 , except that the fermion self - energy is in general @xmath28-dependent .",
    "the propagator gets an extra contribution from the positive energy valence states .",
    "we denote the vacuum and valence particle contributions by  @xmath29 \" and  @xmath30 \" , respectively . for the free massive propagator for instance",

    ".  4 up to five loops .    split each loop into a sum of @xmath35 and @xmath36 contributions .",
    "this generates @xmath37 distinct ,  labeled \" diagrams out of each @xmath38-loop diagram in fig .",
    "4 . then analyze each labeled diagram with respect to the question whether it is accounted for by the effective action with the dirac sea integrated out .",
    "if it is not , add a new term to @xmath17 which generates the corresponding fermion self - energy .",
    "although this scheme is straightforward and constructive , it is still too naive .",
    "we will see that it would be meaningless to terminate the procedure at any finite number of loops .",
    "remember that the mass term ( [ p3 ] ) already includes an infinite number of diagrams due to the self - consistency condition ( see fig .  2 )",
    "otherwise , dimensional transmutation , a truly non - perturbative phenomenon , could not occur .",
    "we can only make sense out of the @xmath38-loop contribution to the effective lagrangian if we perform appropriate resummations .",
    "this turns out to be a crucial element of the whole procedure and the way in which the bare coupling constant @xmath16 gets traded for a finite effective coupling constant .    to explain how this works ,",
    "let us go through the first few terms of the loop expansion in some detail .",
    "guided by the dhn baryon at small filling , we shall treat @xmath20 and @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) as being of the same order @xmath41 and derive systematically all terms up to o(@xmath42 ) .    at two - loop order ,",
    "the only diagram ( out of 4 labeled diagrams ) which induces a new term in @xmath17 is the one shown in fig .",
    "this corresponds to a vertex correction to the @xmath35 tadpole in fig .",
    "technically , it involves the scalar vacuum polarization loop ( labeled @xmath36 in fig .",
    "5a ) , where scalar means that the vertices are just 1 .",
    "we evaluate it by standard feynman rules and expand the result in powers of the 4-momentum @xmath43 flowing through the graph . the result for the sum of the @xmath35 tadpole and fig .",
    "5a then gives the following self energy contribution , @xmath44 here , the scalar condensate in momentum space , @xmath45 , is defined so as to include only @xmath35 terms . whereas the @xmath39-dependent correction terms are suppressed ( remember that @xmath46 ) ,",
    "the @xmath47 contribution @xmath48 needs a special treatment . according to the gap equation ( [ p2 ] ) ,",
    "this term is actually of o(1 ) so that the series expansion starting with eq .",
    "( [ p5 ] ) is meaningless as it stands .",
    "we therefore sum the whole series of graphs shown in fig .  6    into a geometrical series , or , equivalently ,",
    "replace the bare coupling constant by the effective , momentum dependent coupling @xmath49 due to the gap equation , the 1 in the denominator is now cancelled against @xmath50 , and the bare coupling constant @xmath16 drops out of this expression . expanding the @xmath43-dependent terms again [ to o(@xmath51 ) ] , we arrive at the following momentum dependent effective coupling , @xmath52 it is now easy to write down a two - loop effective lagrangian which would give just these correction terms ( correct at two - loop level , but containing higher order terms due to resummation ) , @xmath53 notice that the bare coupling constant @xmath16 in the original @xmath54 term has been replaced by @xmath55 , and new four - fermion interaction terms containing derivatives of @xmath20 have been generated .",
    "higher order terms could easily be obtained from the full @xmath43-dependence of the vacuum polarization graph if desired .",
    "the result is manifestly non - perturbative , as it does not contain @xmath16 , and finite owing to the use of the gap equation .",
    "it may be worthwhile to pause here and comment on the value of the leading order effective coupling , @xmath56 [ see eq .",
    "( [ p8 ] ) ] .",
    "this quantity already appeared in the original paper by gross and neveu @xcite as fermion - fermion scattering amplitude at zero momentum .",
    "these authors also discuss the scalar @xmath57 meson , pointing out that the square of the fermion - antifermion-@xmath57 coupling constant is given by @xmath58 .",
    "one can then understand the effective coupling in a similar way as in the old fermi theory of weak interactions , namely as a product of two coupling constants and a heavy boson propagator ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 keeping the momentum dependent terms approximately accounts for the finite range of the @xmath57-exchange .",

    "the interesting case is the one where there are four pseudoscalar vertices and one scalar vertex , the latter connecting the two @xmath36 bubbles .",
    "the calculation including all necessary resummations yields @xmath149 it yields exactly the same magnitude as ( [ p51 ] ) but the opposite sign , so that the four- and five - loop terms cancel in the njl@xmath9 model . in our opinion",
    "this cancellation is an expression of the low energy theorem according to which the @xmath150 interaction at zero momentum should vanish @xcite . here",
    "this comes about as a result of a cancellation between the @xmath151 vertex and the process @xmath152 involving the @xmath153 vertex , see fig .",
    "it is interesting that the njl@xmath9 model respects the low energy theorems in the large @xmath0 limit , in spite of the usual strong reservations against goldstone bosons in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "we have now identified all terms of o(@xmath139 ) in the effective lagrangian . as announced , the calculation was more involved than in the gn@xmath9 model .",
    "whereas in the gn@xmath9 case we had to deal with four- , six- and eight - fermion interactions in lo , nlo and nnlo , here we had to sum up terms corresponding to 2@xmath38-fermion interactions with arbitrary @xmath38 already in lo .",
    "the reason is the massless pion pole which induces inverse powers of @xmath41 .",
    "it is responsible for the non - locality of the lo effective interaction for the njl@xmath9 model which nevertheless has a rather simple final form , @xmath154 the pseudoscalar term is associated with the fermion - fermion interaction through @xmath133-exchange , see fig .",
    "the pion propagator has a long range and is dressed as in fig .",

    "the non - locality of @xmath17 is irritating , since it is expected to make the solution of the euler - lagrange equation much harder .",

    "so we wind up with a local field theory containing both fermions and an elementary @xmath133-meson , the latter described by the field @xmath157 .",
    "since the derivation was quite complicated ( in particular identifying all lo terms ) , it is again crucial to test @xmath17 against exact results for the njl@xmath9 model .",
    "for this purpose , we choose the multi - fermion bound states of shei @xcite .",
    "they are analogous to the dhn baryon of the gn@xmath9 model in the way they were derived ( inverse scattering theory ) , but in our opinion carry vanishing baryon number and should be regarded as  baryonium \" states @xcite .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "take the valence spinor wave function of shei in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath159 with @xmath160 and energy @xmath161 .",
    "this yields the ( valence ) condensates @xmath162 eq .",

    "we find that @xmath96 satisfies the hf equation up to corrections of o(@xmath167 ) .",

    "now consider the question of baryon number .",
    "one interesting aspect of the njl@xmath9 model is the fact that a topologically non - trivial mean field can induce fermion number in the dirac sea @xcite .",
    "since this is a physical effect but we have eliminated the dirac sea , it must show up somewhere else in the effective theory . to understand what is happening , we treat the fermion density @xmath173 as an effective operator , in analogy with the scalar or pseudoscalar densities above . to this end",
    "we write down the dressed tadpole with a @xmath174 vertex and again resolve it into positive and negative energy contributions .",
    "the diagrams involving only @xmath36 terms add up to the divergent density of the ( vacuum ) dirac sea and can be subtracted .",
    "the @xmath35 tadpole represents the density contribution of the valence level , @xmath175 , see fig .",
    "its first correction is driven by the two - loop graphs in fig .",
    "if the upper vertex is 1 ( scalar @xmath35 loop , fig .",
    "11b ) , the vacuum polarization bubble is the time component of a four - vector and therefore proportional to @xmath70 ( where @xmath43 is the external momentum ) . since the self - energy insertion is static , this term vanishes",
    "this is the reason why we did not have to worry about induced fermion number in the gn@xmath9 model . if the upper vertex is @xmath124 ( pseudoscalar @xmath35 loop , fig .",
    "11c ) , the @xmath36 bubble behaves like the space component of a four - vector and is proportional to @xmath176 . we can replace the pseudoscalar @xmath35 bubble by the full pseudoscalar self - energy @xmath177 , thereby summing up all the lo diagrams as explained above .",
    "the result for the induced fermion density in coordinate space then assumes the simple form @xmath178 , where the derivative reflects the above mentioned @xmath176-dependence .",
    "the total fermion density in the effective theory consists of the valence fermion density and the induced one , @xmath179 this allows us to correctly compute the fermion density without dirac sea . if we insert the expressions for the shei bound state , we get an exact cancellation between the two contributions , in agreement with two independent recent results @xcite .",

    "finally , we comment on some early work which is relevant in this context . in the 70 s , there was some debate about the use of  classical calculations \" for fermions in field theory .",
    "these were mean field calculations without dirac sea , solving non - linear dirac - hf equations @xcite exactly as in our  no - sea \" effective theory .",
    "what was done at that time simply amounted to use the original lagrangian with a mass term added and replacing the bare coupling constant by an effective one .",
    "shei @xcite noted that this type of calculation gave reasonable results for the gn@xmath9 model , but was completely off in the case of the njl@xmath9 model .",
    "we can now understand the reasons behind this observation , using the framework of effective field theory . in the gn@xmath9 model ,",
    "the lowest order effective lagrangian happens to agree with the ad - hoc prescription used in refs .",
    "this explains why it gave useful results , at least for small filling fraction .",
    "incidentally , another example of a  no - sea \" calculation for this model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the effective coupling constant @xmath56 was determined  phenomenologically \" , see eq .",
    "( 4.17 ) of that paper .",
    "we have now derived this number microscopically and are able to improve the calculation in a systematic fashion . in the njl@xmath9 model , the naive recipe for writing down the effective action breaks down due to the pion pole .",
    "one can not ignore the singular momentum dependence of the effective pseudoscalar coupling ( @xmath193 ) which gives rise to long range non - localities .",
    "this is the reason for the observed discrepancy between short range  no - sea \" and long range semi - classical mean fields .",
    "it is amusing that in the heavy - fermion limit , we do recover an effective action which agrees with the simple recipe of adding a mass term and introducing an effective coupling , see eq .",
    "( [ p74 ] ) .",
    "hence the technically rather nice classical calculations done in the 70 s for the chiral limit of the njl@xmath9 model ( where they had to fail , as we now understand ) can be  recycled \" to solve the njl@xmath9 model in the heavy - fermion limit @xmath184 . in this regime",
    ", the approximations can be justified by effective field theory . in the representation of the @xmath102-matrices ( [ p1a ] ) , the bound state found by lee et al .",
    "@xcite has the spinor wave function ( filling fraction @xmath24 , energy @xmath194 ) @xmath195 we have checked that it satisfies the ( classical ) non - linear dirac equation obtained from the effective lagrangian ( [ p74 ] ) exactly .",
    "the baryon mass is given by @xmath196 due to the truncation of the effective action , only the two listed terms of the series expansion can be trusted . at the same time",
    "the induced fermion density gets suppressed by a factor of @xmath197 as compared to the valence density . the corresponding result for the gn@xmath9 model with effective action ( [ p75 ] )",
    "can be read off eq .",
    "( [ p39 ] ) ( for @xmath184 ) and agrees with ( [ p77 ] ) to this order in @xmath24 . as a matter of fact , the spinors @xmath96",
    "also become equal in the limit @xmath198 , as can be seen by expanding in powers of @xmath24 .",
    "the reason can be traced back to the fact that the ratio of pseudoscalar to scalar condensates decreases like @xmath197 .",
    "thus we learn that in the heavy - fermion limit , the difference between discrete and continuous chiral symmetry of the four - fermion interaction becomes less and less important , and baryons of the gn@xmath9 and njl@xmath9 model approach each other . as far as the njl@xmath9 model is concerned , there is so far no independent information available about this regime these findings could be compared to .",
    "using exactly solvable four - fermion models as theoretical laboratory , we have demonstrated that  integrating out the dirac sea \" is indeed a viable concept .",
    "tractable effective lagrangians could be derived , valid for multi - fermion bound states with weakly occupied valence level or large bare fermion masses .",
    "whereas the original semi - classical calculations of bound states in gn@xmath9 and njl@xmath9 models required sophisticated and highly specialized techniques to deal with the dirac sea , the effective theories amount to solving the classical euler - lagrange equation , here a non - linear dirac equation .",
    "one might suspect that the difficulties of the full non - perturbative calculations come back in the derivation of the effective lagrangian , but this is not quite so . although this derivation has non - perturbative features in the form of unavoidable resummations , the actual calculation is based on standard one - loop feynman diagrams and thus perturbative .",
    "this suggests that similar techniques can also be applied to more realistic , higher dimensional theories .    in the gn@xmath9 case",
    ", we were able to derive the nnlo approximation in some small expansion parameter .",
    "since the exact dhn baryons and their generalization to finite bare fermion mass are known , we could show that the resulting effective theory works quantitatively .",
    "thus baryon binding energies can be predicted  classically \" in the full range of filling fraction and bare mass at the 1@xmath121 level , quite unexpectedly for us .",
    "as far as the formalism is concerned , the main lesson we learned is that the bare parameters of the original theory ( @xmath199 ) disappear owing to resummations .",
    "it would not make sense to truncate the procedure at any fixed number of loops .",
    "all questions of renormalization and uv divergences are then properly dealt with and do not show up any more in the effective theory , which is of course finite .    in the njl@xmath9 case , when applying the same strategy we ran into a new difficulty .",
    "the pseudoscalar effective coupling develops a singularity at @xmath132 due to the massless pion pole .",
    "although one can again identify the lo of a systematic expansion in a small parameter , this necessarily causes a long range non - locality of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the purely fermionic , non - local effective theory can be cast into a more convenient  almost local \" form by introducing an additional elementary pion field .",
    "the resulting theory contains elementary fermions and pions but is fully consistent , judging from the derivation and the comparison with shei s bound states .",
    "the role of the massless pion explains the conspicuous difference between short range mean fields in the gn@xmath9 model and long range mean fields in the njl@xmath9 model , which had caused headaches in early , more naive attempts to treat fermions classically .",
    "moreover , we could show how the important phenomenon of  induced fermion number \" can be recovered in a  no - sea \" effective theory .",
    "finally , notice that no attempt was made to reduce the dirac equation to a non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "although this would be possible , we feel that it would only make our formulae more messy .",
    "our main focus here was not on relativistic kinematics , but on the dynamical effects of the dirac sea .",
