    "there is no currently accepted scenario for the formation of the parent bodies of primitive meteorites which accounts for the most obvious of their properties .",
    "these properties ( reviewed by scott and krot 2005 and discussed in more detail in section 2.1 ) include ( a ) dominance by aerodynamically well - sorted mineral particles of sub - mm size ; ( b ) class - to - class variation in well - defined physical , chemical , and isotopic properties ; ( c ) a spread of 1 myr or so between the formation times of the oldest and youngest objects found in the same meteorite ; ( d ) a spread of 1 - 3 myr in radiometric ages of different meteorite types ; and ( e ) a dearth of melted asteroids , with model results for even some melted asteroids which imply myr delays in formation relative to ancient minerals . in recent years , meteoritic evidence has appeared for some very early - formed planetesimals , which represent a minority of both meteorites and asteroids .",
    "this implies that primary accretion started early and continued for several million years - thus , it was fairly inefficient and did not run quickly to completion .",
    "most current models for this  primary accretion \" stage ( reviewed by cuzzi and weidenschilling 2006 and dominik et al 2007 ) can be classified as either ( a ) incremental growth , where large particles sweep up smaller ones by inelastic collisions involving porous surfaces , and growth proceeds hierarchically ; or ( b ) instability , where physical sticking is irrelevant and collective effects drive collapse to km - sizes or larger on very short timescales . those who favor instability models , most of which rely on gravity and",
    "occur in a particle - rich nebula midplane , are concerned by the poorly understood sticking of mineral particle aggregates and the apparent difficulty of growing beyond meter size due to rapid inward migration and collisional disruption .",
    "those who favor incremental growth have noted that midplane instability models are precluded by even very weak global turbulence , and that , in the dense midplane layers that form when turbulence is absent , incremental accretion is at low relative velocity and the meter - size barrier is not a problem .",
    "however , the most sophisticated models of incremental accretion in nonturbulent nebulae find it to be _ so _ efficient that large planetesimals grow in only @xmath0 years throughout the asteroid belt region ( weidenschilling 2000 ) , a short time which is difficult to reconcile with constraints ( a - e ) above .",
    "a third class of scenario suggests that a complex interplay between several nonlinear processes - turbulence , pressure gradients , and gravity - may concentrate appropriately sized particles and lead to planetesimal growth ( cuzzi et al 2001 , 2005 , 2007 ; johansen et al 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "scenarios which involve preferentially meter - sized objects encounter concerns about whether meter - sized objects can survive their own high - velocity mutual collisions in this sort of turbulent environment ( _ cf .",
    "_ sirono 2000 , langkowski et al 2007 , ormel et al 2007 ) .",
    "however , in principle , such boulder - concentration scenarios can proceed independently in the same environment as discussed in this paper , where we focus on mm - size particles .",
    "most of the above scenarios provide no natural explanation for observed meteorite properties ( a ) and ( b ) above .",
    "in particular , the evidence for the h chondrite class ( and perhaps all the ordinary chondrites ) suggests that entire asteroids of 10 - 100 km diameter formed directly from a physically , chemically , and isotopically homogeneous mix of dust - rimmed particles of similar size ( section 2.1 ) . in this paper",
    ", we outline a possible path by which entire batches of mm - size , aerodynamically sorted particles might proceed directly in turbulence ( even if sporadically ) to planetesimals having the properties outlined above .",
    "we find that sufficiently large and dense clumps of mm - size particles can form by turbulent concentration such that , even if classical gravitational instability ca nt operate , their self - gravity may still allow them to survive disruptive forces and slowly sediment into a  sandpile \" planetesimal .",
    "this simple analytical model is backed up by some numerical simulations that support the basic idea . in sections 2.2 and 2.3",
    ", we review the most relevant physics that determines the properties of dense , particle - rich zones or clumps in turbulent nebulae . in section 3",
    ", we address the fate of these dense clumps using analytical and numerical models of their evolution .",
    "we derive the combination of size and mass density a clump must have to evolve into a  sandpile \" having some degree of internal strength . in subsequent stages not modeled here , we imagine that collisions and thermal sintering transform these sandpiles into the cohesive rocky parent bodies we see today .",
    "however , in the outer solar system , lower energy collisions and weaker thermal processing might well allow planetesimals to retain their initial low - strength states , as seen for some cometary objects ( _ eg .",
    ", _ asphaug and benz 1996 ) .",
    "one can extract a number of clues from primitive ( unmelted ) meteorites regarding the primary accretion process by which their parent bodies first formed ( scott and krot 2005 , taylor 2005 ) . for the best evidence , one must look back through extensive subsequent evolutionary stages .",
    "even unmelted bodies in the 100 km size range have incurred extensive collisional evolution ( bischoff et al .",
    "2006 ) , producing compaction , fragmentation , and physical grinding and mixing on and beneath their surfaces , which may obscure the record of primary accretion .",
    "model studies ( _ e.g. _ , petit et al 2001 , kenyon and bromley 2004 , 2006 ; bottke et al 2005 ; chambers 2004,2006 ; weidenschilling and cuzzi 2006 ) suggest that the collisional stage occurred after dispersal of the nebula gas allowed the orbital eccentricities of primitive bodies to grow .",
    "we are concerned with an earlier stage , when the still - abundant nebula gas led to a more benign environment with fewer and gentler collisions .",
    "the direct products of primary accretion might be most clearly visible in the rare  primary texture \" seen in some cm ( metzler et al 1992 ) and co ( brearley 1993 ) chondrites . in these objects , or more specifically in unbroken fragments within them , the texture consists of similarly - sized , dust - rimmed particles packed next to each other as if gently brought together and compressed , with no evidence for local fracturing or grinding .",
    "even after collisional effects associated with subsequent stages of growth have blurred this signal , perhaps even mixing material from different parent bodies , evidence remains in the bulk properties of all chondrite classes .",
    "chondrite classes are defined by their distinctive mineral , chemical , and isotopic properties ( _ e.g. _ grossman et al 1988 , scott and krot 2005 , weisberg et al 2006 ) .",
    "large samples of material with a quite well defined nature were accumulated at one place and/or time , and material of a quite different , but equally well - defined , nature was accumulated at another place and/or time into a different parent body . amongst the most obvious aspects of these class properties is a dominance within chondrites of sub - mm size mineral particles ( generically  chondrules \" ; grossman 1988 , jones et al 2000 , 2005 ; connolly et al 2006 ) which are aerodynamically well - sorted .",
    "aerodynamic sorting of chondrite components was first emphasized by dodd ( 1976 ) , hughes ( 1978 , 1980 ) , and skinner and leenhouts ( 1993 ) , and has since been discussed by a variety of authors ( see cuzzi and weidenschilling 2006 for a summary of the observations and arguments supporting aerodynamics ) .",
    "chondrules have a size which varies from class to class , but is distinctive and narrowly defined within a given class or chondrite .",
    "the evidence suggests that chondrules do not comprise merely a thin surface layer swept up by a large object ( scott 2006 ) . in the case which we suggest as an archetype , the h - type ordinary chondrite parent body is widely believed to be a 100 km radius object ( perhaps the asteroid hebe ) , initially composed entirely of a physically , chemically , and isotopically homogeneous mix of chondrules and associated material , which was thermally metamorphosed by accreted @xmath1al to a degree which varied with depth , into an onion - shell structure , and subsequently broken up in several stages ( taylor et al 1987 , trieloff et al 2003 , mcsween et al 2002 , grimm et al 2005 ) .",
    "bottke et al ( 2005 ) conclude from models of collisional evolution in the primordial ( massive ) and the current ( depleted ) asteroid belt , that the primordial asteroid mass distribution was dominated by objects having diameter of around 100 km , rather than having a powerlaw size distribution somewhat like that of the current population .",
    "we see the essential challenge as understanding how such a large object can be assembled from such a homogeneous mixture of mm - size constituents , while other objects ( arguably the parents of the l and ll type ordinary chondrites as well , and logically then the parents of the chondrites of all classes ) are assembled from distinct , yet comparably homogeneous , ensembles of qualitatively similar particles .",
    "moreover this assembly , or primary accretion , phase of nebula evolution must persist for a duration of 1myr or more between the formation times of the oldest and youngest meteorites ( wadhwa et al 2007 ) and even of objects found in the same meteorite .",
    "the @xmath2 1 myr age spread between ancient refractory inclusions ( cais ) and chondrules is well known ( russell et al 2006 ) , but there may even be a comparably extended age spread between different chondrules in a given meteorite ( kita et al 2005 ) .    in recent years , radiometric dating of achondrites ( melted meteorites ) has revealed some early - formed ( and early melted ) planetesimals ( kleine et al 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "one expects early formation and melting to go together , because objects larger than only 10 km or so , which accreted at the same time that refractory inclusions formed ( 4.567 byr ago ) , would have incorporated their full complement of @xmath1al and would have melted ( latourette and wasserburg 1998 ; woolum and cassen 1999 , hevey and sanders 2006 ) .",
    "thus , early accretion implies melting , and lack of melting requires late accretion .",
    "model results imply that , to avoid complete melting , 100 km bodies must accrete only after a typically 1.5 - 2 myr delay relative to ancient cai minerals ( reviewed by mcsween",
    "et al 2002 and ghosh et al 2006 ) . while unknown selection and sampling effects may influence the limited meteorite data record , spectral analysis of the entire asteroid database",
    "also suggests that melted asteroids are rare .",
    "that is , while debate continues as to whether small amounts of melt might be found on the surfaces of many asteroids , which might be caused by impacts ( _ e.g. _ gaffey et al 1993 , 2002 ) , only vesta and a handful of other examples of fully melted basaltic objects have been found in spite of extensive searches ( binzel et al 2002 ; moskovitz et al 2007 ) .",
    "put together , this body of information suggests that primary accretion started early but continued for several million years - thus , it was inefficient , or at least sporadic . by comparison ,",
    "midplane incremental accretion in a nonturbulent nebula accretes numerous ceres size bodies and tens of thousands of 10 - 100 km size objects in only @xmath3 years ( weidenschilling 2000 ) ; thus , it is highly efficient .",
    "models suggest that the density , temperature , and composition of the nebula evolved significantly over several million years ( bell et al 1995 , dalessio et al .",
    "2005 , ciesla and cuzzi 2006 ) .",
    "thus one expects the properties of forming planetesimals to change with _ time _ even though the chemical , isotopic , and mineralogical properties of the mixture of solids from which they formed might have been fairly uniform in _ space _ at any _ given _ time ( see cuzzi et al 2003 and ciesla 2007 for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "reality might have been even more complicated - there is some evidence that chondrites of very distinct chemical and isotopic properties might have formed at roughly the same time ( kita et al 2005 ) , suggesting a combination of spatial _ and _ temporal gradients .    in this paper",
    "we present the overview of a scenario by which accumulation of a well - defined particle mix into a large planetesimal - making it a  snapshot \" of the local nebula mix - might occur sporadically or inefficiently in weak turbulence , over an extended period of time and throughout the terrestrial planet region .",
    "the challenge for the future is to show that the accretion processes discussed here can _ quantitatively _ account for the mass needed to build planetesimals of the mass needed to create planetary embryos and planets during the age of the nebula ( chambers 2004 , 2006 ; cuzzi et al 2007 ) .      a variety of astronomical and meteoritical evidence supports weak , but widespread and sustained , nebula turbulence . the observed abundance of small particles at high altitudes above the midplane in many visible protoplanetary nebulae for millions of years",
    "is most easily explained by ongoing turbulence - both to regenerate the small grains in collisions and to redistribute them to the observed altitudes ( dullemond and dominik 2005 ) .",
    "the survival of ancient , high - temperature mineral inclusions ( cais ) in chondrites , in spite of their tendency to drift inwards towards the sun , can also be explained by turbulent diffusion ( cuzzi et al 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , the recent discovery by stardust of both high- and moderate - temperature crystalline silicates in comet wild2 ( brownlee et al 2007 , zolensky et al 2007 ) can be easily understood in this way ( ciesla 2007 ) .",
    "it remains a subject of active theoretical debate as to how , or even whether , the nebula can maintain itself in a turbulent state .",
    "ongoing dissipation by molecular viscosity @xmath4 on the smallest , or kolmogorov , lengthscale requires a production mechanism to continually generate turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "although the very existence of ongoing disk accretion into the star , with the ensuing gravitational energy release , provides an ample energy source , the vehicle for transferring that energy into turbulent gas motions is undetermined .",
    "baroclinic instabilities require substantial opacity at thermal wavelengths , but might be suitable to generate turbulence during the fairly opaque chondrule - cai epoch in the inner solar system ( klahr and bodenheimer 2003 ) .",
    "the widely accepted magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( stone et al 2000 ) may or may not be precluded at the high gas densities of the inner solar system ( turner et al 2007 ) .",
    "the role of pure hydrodynamics operating on radial shear remains unclear , because keplerian disks are nominally stable to linear ( small ) perturbations ( balbus et al 1996 , stone et al 2000 ) .",
    "however , a number of current theoretical studies suggest turbulence might indeed be present ( _ eg . _ arldt and urpin 2004 , busse 2004 , umurhan and regev 2004 , dubrulle et al 2005 , afshordi et al 2005 , mukhopadhyay et al 2005 , mukhopadhyay et al 2006 ) .",
    "much of this recent work focusses on nonlinear ( finite amplitude ) instabilities occurring at the very high reynolds numbers characterizing the nebula , which are well beyond the capability of current numerical and even laboratory models .    ,",
    "of particles having local concentration factor larger than some value of @xmath5 ( from cuzzi et al 2001 ; see also section 2.3 ) .",
    "the curves with symbols represent comparison of the predictive theory described in cuzzi et al ( 2001 ) with 3d numerical simulations at moderate reynolds numbers ; the curves without symbols are extension of the same theory to nebula conditions denoted by their values of @xmath6 .",
    "concentration factors @xmath7 of chondrule precursors",
    "( leading to @xmath8 ) are fairly common for a range of nebula turbulent intensities ( denoted by @xmath6 ) , and help explain lack of chondrule isotopic fractionation ( cuzzi and alexander 2006 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on the much less common , but much denser , regions towards the bottom right side of the plot ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "more general pdfs which separate out the role of vorticity and incorporate the effect of particle mass loading are discussed in section 2.3 and appendix a. , width=297,height=297 ]    in this paper , we simply assume the presence of weak nebula turbulence .",
    "the intensity of turbulence may be characterized by a nondimensional parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the velocity of the most energetic eddies and @xmath13 is the sound speed .",
    "values of @xmath6 in the range @xmath14 are consistent with observed nebula lifetimes , and can be sustained by only a few percent of the gravitational energy released as the nebula disk flows into the sun .",
    "one then estimates the most energetic ( largest ) eddy size as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the nebula vertical scale height , or disk thickness . a cascade to smaller scales ensues ,",
    "where the smallest ( kolmogorov ) eddy scale is @xmath17 1 km and @xmath18 for @xmath19 is the nebula reynolds number ( cuzzi et al 2001 ) .",
    "it has been found both numerically and experimentally that particles of a well defined size and density are concentrated into very dense zones in realistic 3d turbulence ( eaton and fessler 1994 ) .",
    "the optimally concentrated particle has a gas drag stopping time @xmath20 which is equal to the overturn time of the kolmogorov scale eddies . in the nebula , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the particle radius and material density , and @xmath13 and @xmath24 are the gas sound speed and density .",
    "the kolmogorov eddy frequency @xmath25 scales with the orbital frequency @xmath26 as @xmath27 , and particles are most effectively concentrated when @xmath28 ( eaton and fessler 1994 ) .",
    "chondrule - size silicate particles are concentrated for canonical nebula properties if @xmath29 ; moreover the _ shape _ of the concentrated particle size distribution is parameter - independent , and agrees very well with that of chondrules ( paque and cuzzi 1997 , cuzzi et al 2001 ) .",
    "we define the concentration factor @xmath30 , where we denote the local volume mass density of particles as @xmath31 and @xmath32 is its nebula average value , and the particle mass loading @xmath33 . for instance , figure 1 ( cuzzi et al 2001 ) shows the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for @xmath5 determined from numerical simulations at moderate reynolds number ( curves with symbols ) and predicted for plausible nebula reynolds numbers ( curves without symbols ) .",
    "note that the volume fraction having @xmath34 is quite substantial , which helps explain some mineralogical and isotopic properties of chondrules ( cuzzi and alexander 2006 ) .",
    "is different from the definition in cuzzi and alexander ( 2006 ) , which is equivalent to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the fractional abundance of solids to hydrogen gas by mass .",
    "thus values of @xmath37 in cuzzi and alexander ( 2006 ) are the equivalent of @xmath38 - a much more common occurrence than the situation we study here .",
    "] not surprisingly , the volume fraction decreases for larger @xmath5 . in this work we focus on the less abundant , but higher mass density , concentrations towards the lower - right hand side of the pdf .",
    "the turbulent concentration pdfs of figure 1 did not allow for the feedback of the concentrated particles on the gas .",
    "this  mass loading \" would be expected to damp gas turbulent motions once the particle mass density significantly exceeds that of the gas , and lead to a saturation of concentration at some value .",
    "recent work which _ includes _ the feedback effects , through drag , of particle density on the damping of turbulence , has shown that values of @xmath39 can indeed be achieved - although less commonly than in the unloaded models such as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this _ cascade model _ of turbulent concentration ( hogan and cuzzi 2007 ) is summarized in appendix a. based on these results , we adopt @xmath40 as an upper bound in all stability and evolution modeling .",
    "the ability of gravity to overwhelm opposing forces is a well - known theme in astrophysics , dating back 80 years to early studies of star formation by jeans . over 30 years ago",
    ", gravitational instability ( gi ) of solids in a dense layer near the nebula midplane was proposed to lead directly to solid planetesimals on a dynamical timescale ( the orbit time ) ( safronov 1969 , goldreich and ward 1973 ) .",
    "traditional gi thresholds require the dynamical ( collapse ) time of a dense region @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the gravitational constant , to be shorter than both the transit time due to random velocity and the local shear ( vorticity ) timescale ( toomre 1964 ) .",
    "these arguments imply that gi occurs when the local particle density exceeds a few times the roche density @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the solar mass and @xmath45 is the distance from the sun ( safronov 1991 , cuzzi et al 2001 ) . however , this scenario is frustrated by self - generated midplane turbulence even if the nebula is not globally turbulent ( _ e.g. _ weidenschilling 1980,1995 ; cuzzi et al 1993,1994 ; johansen et al 2007 ) . that is , a dense layer of cm - size and larger particles orbits at a different velocity than the pressure - supported gas , leading to a vertical velocity shear which becomes turbulent and stirs the particle layer .",
    "a more recent flavor of gi requires the particles to be small enough that the particle - rich midplane acts as a single fluid , like fog , so that its vertical density stratification stabilizes it against self - generated turbulence ( sekiya 1998 , sekiya and ishitsu 2001 , youdin and shu 2002 , sekiya and takeda 2003 , youdin and chiang 2004 ) . because the particles must be very small to satisfy this _",
    "one - phase _ requirement ( mm - size and smaller ) , their settling towards the midplane is frustrated by even the faintest breath of nebula turbulence ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "if the particles are prevented from settling into a sufficiently dense layer that their mass density can stratify the total density ( eg , dubrulle et al 1995 , cuzzi and weidenschilling 2006 ) , the conditions needed to trigger the instability are never achieved .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we study the evolution of a dense clump such as might form towards the lower right domain of figure 1 , albeit in a simplified way .",
    "we treat a clump as an isolated object when in reality it exists in a context of surrounding material of varying density . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the implications of more realistic conditions .",
    "the role of the _ gas pressure _ in gi for nebula particles has been almost universally ignored , even though its importance was pointed out decades ago by sekiya ( 1983 ) .",
    "we encountered it ourselves independently . to test our gi thresholds , we initially ran numerical models of static , but very dense , clumps ( @xmath47 ) , expecting them to collapse with gravitational free - fall or dynamical collapse times @xmath48 and velocities @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the clump diameter .",
    "we assumed a spherically symmetrical dense particle clump with density @xmath31 , embedded in gas with density @xmath24 , where @xmath51 .",
    "instead , only very slow shrinkage ensued .",
    "we suspected that the collapse was being artificially blocked by our incompressible code .",
    "we then developed a fully compressible 1d model which confirmed our incompressible calculations and clearly demonstrated a much higher , gas - pressure - dependent @xmath37 threshold for gi in the limit when @xmath52 .",
    "results from the model are shown in figure 2 .",
    "is like a mach number .",
    "nebula values of @xmath13 and @xmath24 lie in the top set of nearly linear curves , allowing only slow inward sedimentation on the timescale @xmath53 ( for @xmath54 ) .",
    "that is , under nebula conditions of gas density and temperature , and particle loading , the gas behaves as if it were incompressible and prevents dynamical timescale gi for particles with stopping time much less than the dynamical collapse time.,width=297,height=240 ]    * figure 2 * shows results from this fully compressible model , illustrating how @xmath55 is required for traditional ( dynamical timescale ) instability to occur . the initial condition was a gaussian blob having density distribution @xmath56 .",
    "slow shrinkage of the particles through the gas is seen in the stable , ",
    "incompressible \" regime where nebula parameters lie , well within the flat curves at the top of the plot with @xmath57 for @xmath58 km , @xmath59cm / s , and @xmath60 g @xmath61 .",
    "the high value of @xmath62 required for true dynamical timescale collapse ( given the chosen value of @xmath40 ) would require smaller gas sound speed or larger clump size @xmath50 and gas density @xmath24 , by orders of magnitude .    the slow shrinkage in the stable regime results from particles sedimenting inwards towards their mutual center under their own self - gravity at their terminal velocity @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the local gravitational acceleration due to the clump s mass , and @xmath65 is the particle stopping time .",
    "thus @xmath66 for @xmath52 , and the  sedimentation \" timescale is @xmath67 roughly 30 - 300 orbit periods at 2.5 au for 300@xmath68 radius chondrules and @xmath69 ; that is , much longer than @xmath70 .",
    "it seems inappropriate to describe this slow ongoing evolution as an instability - certainly in midplane scenarios where it was slow vertical sedimentation by individual particles toward the midplane that produced the  unstable \" situation in the first place , and where only further slow sedimentation transpires .",
    "the situation is more akin to star formation mediated by ambipolar diffusion than by traditional gravitational instability .",
    "gas pressure even precludes the safronov - goldreich - ward gi in the form it was originally proposed , where cm - sized particles were envisioned ( although @xmath53 would be faster for literally cm - sized particles , and more closely approaches @xmath70 ) .",
    "the results of sekiya ( 1983 ) have apparently been overlooked by all subsequent workers , who have invariably assumed a toomre - safronov - goldreich - ward type _ particle _ ensemble which is decoupled from the gas , and stabilized ( on small scales ) only by particle random velocities .",
    "this gas pressure constraint is , however , crucial for particles in the chondrule size regime where @xmath71 an hour and @xmath72 a year , and must be applied to all gi models involving chondrule - sized particles .",
    "the good news is that for the interesting range of nebula gas density and particle concentration values , the gas _ does _ actually behave as if it were incompressible ( validating the use of an incompressible code in numerical models such as shown in section 3.4 ) .",
    "the physics is easily understood in the one - phase regime @xmath73 .",
    "the particles feel no direct pressure force , but are firmly trapped to the gas which does . the ( inward ) gravitational force is dominated by particles for @xmath74 .",
    "the particles drag and compress the gas with them as they begin to collapse under their self - gravity , producing a radial gas density gradient @xmath75 ; this translates into a large outward _ pressure _",
    "gradient @xmath76 which acts on the gas , and thereby also on the strongly coupled particles .",
    "the gravitational force per unit volume is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the clump mass and @xmath79 its radius .",
    "after some incipient shrinkage and compression occurs , the outward pressure gradient force per unit volume becomes roughly @xmath80 , where @xmath13 is the gas sound speed .",
    "then for gi to be possible , @xmath81 , giving the criterion for gi as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 is like an inverse mach number @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "an alternate ( perturbation ) approach compares the incremental changes @xmath87 and @xmath88 associated with a small gravitationally induced shrinkage characterized by @xmath89 .",
    "it is straightforward to show ( for @xmath90 ) that @xmath91 under nebula conditions .",
    "thus the clump is  stiffened \" by pressure and even a small incremental shrinkage is self - limiting . inspection of * figure 2 * shows small oscillations which suggest that a formal linear stability analysis might lead to an improved stability criterion ; this is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .    for @xmath92 a few @xmath93 km and @xmath60 g @xmath61 ( desch et al 2005 ) , @xmath94 .",
    "this criterion for gi can be compared with the traditional criterion for ( marginal , or maximal ) instability which is widely used as _",
    "the _ criterion for gravitational instability , roughly twice the roche density @xmath43 ( goldreich and ward 1973 , safronov 1991 , cuzzi et al 1993 ) .",
    "the ratio of the two thresholds is : @xmath95 for @xmath96 to @xmath97 . for the midplane gis which have been widely discussed in the past ( reviewed by cuzzi and weidenschilling 2006 ) , @xmath98 km ,",
    "so the traditional gi criterion falls short by a factor of more than @xmath99 ( _ cf . _",
    "sekiya 1983 ) !",
    "this degree of mass concentration is unlikely under any plausible circumstances , especially for particles which are already well trapped to the gas . for the ubiquitous dense clumps we discuss here , which form at all elevations , @xmath100 km .",
    "thus the pressure - supported gas phase prevents the tightly coupled particles from undergoing gi until the particle mass loading is hundreds of times larger than the traditional gi criterion ( which is on the order of the roche density @xmath101 ) .",
    "nevertheless , sekiya ( 1983 ) also noted that when @xmath31 is in the range usually cited for gi ( a few times @xmath101 , or @xmath102 a few hundred ) , a 3d  incompressible mode \" arises which , while not explicitly stated , we interpret as retaining an identifiable cohort of particles . an  incompressible mode \" might resemble a blob of water oscillating in zero - gravity .",
    "dense zones which result from turbulent concentration are candidates for such incompressible modes , even at mass loadings too low to induce actual gi . however , the fate of such slowly evolving entities in the presence of likely perturbations has never been explored .",
    "below we discuss the least avoidable , most pervasive disruptive perturbation which such clumps would encounter once they form , which we believe to be ram pressure disruption due to systematic velocity differences between the dense zones and the gas , and then derive conditions under which these clumps can survive to become planetesimals .",
    "several kinds of perturbation by the enveloping nebula gas might disrupt a dense clump before the slow sedimentation of its constituent particles towards their mutual center ( on the timescale @xmath53 ) can produce a moderately compact object .    perhaps the simplest to discuss and dismiss are turbulent pressure , velocity , and/or vorticity _ fluctuations _ encountered by the clump .",
    "turbulent pressure fluctuations on the scale @xmath50 have typical intensity @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is certainly smaller than the fluctuating velocity @xmath105 of the largest eddy ( the dominant energy - containing eddy ) .",
    "the ratio of even the largest eddy pressure fluctuations to the steady ram pressure from the headwind @xmath106 ( @xmath45 is the semimajor axis ) is @xmath107 . since @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 unless @xmath111 .",
    "nebula evolutionary timescales , and parameters leading to turbulent concentration of chondrule - sized particles in the asteroid belt region , imply @xmath112 depending on gas density and other properties ( cuzzi et al 2001 ) .",
    "this suggests that turbulent velocity fluctuations on clump lengthscales play a small role .",
    "we have run simulations of clumps settling in gravity with and without enveloping turbulence , and the typical evolutions are qualitatively similar .",
    "we next address local _ average _ vorticities on the lengthscale of a clump .",
    "it has long been known that local vorticity is a factor in gravitational instability ( toomre 1964 , goldreich and ward 1973 ) . because eddies much smaller than the largest scale of turbulence typically have larger vorticity than the keplerian shear commonly explored ( _ eg . _",
    "toomre 1964 ) , this is a concern in principle . for example , in the inertial range , @xmath113 ( tennekes and lumley 1972 ) . then for @xmath100 km , @xmath15 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "however , turbulent concentration has the property that dense particle zones preferentially lie in zones of locally _ low _ vorticity compared to the average at their lengthscale ( eaton and fessler 1994 ) .",
    "statistical studies ( hogan and cuzzi 2007 ) show that dense zones in high @xmath116 environments can form in regions with local vorticity 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the average value expected for that lengthscale ( see also figure 5 ) .",
    "below we sketch how such a constraint is derived and applied .",
    "a simplified requirement for gravitational binding of a clump of lengthscale @xmath50 and mass density @xmath31 , in the presence of local rotation at angular velocity @xmath117 , is @xmath118 . recalling that the local vorticity @xmath117 can vary by orders of magnitude from its average value @xmath119 , we normalize both sides of the above relationship between @xmath31 and @xmath120 by the average inertial range enstrophy @xmath121 , and define the normalized enstrophy @xmath122 .",
    "this quantity provides the horizontal axis on figure 5 .",

    "we find that gravitational binding requires @xmath128 .",
    "this constraint yields diagonal lines on plots of the sort shown in figure 5 ( for an example see cuzzi et al 2007 ) .",
    "interesting regions of parameter space remain accessible to a degree that depends on quantitative modeling of the pdf @xmath129 .",
    "obviously , more detailed numerical models of clumps in realistic turbulence are needed to assess these perturbations .",
    "we will assume , for the purposes of this study , that turbulent pressure ( and associated vorticity ) fluctuations are a minor influence and that regions which are stable to their own local vorticity exist ( see cuzzi et al 2007 ) .",
    "this leaves the dominant disruptive process , unavoidably shared by turbulent and laminar nebulae , as ram pressure disruption due to _ systematic _",
    "velocity differences between the clump and the gas , as described below .",
    "incidentally , survival against ram pressure gives the horizontal stability boundaries in figure 3 of cuzzi et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "emplacing these constraints on pdfs obtained from cascade models is somewhat involved , and a full quantitative description of the situation is deferred to a future paper .      here , for simplicity",
    ", we envision the evolution of a single , isolated dense clump with @xmath74 , merely as an example of one of the many dense clumps formed near the lower right hand corner of figure 1 .",
    "the clump exerts a strong collective influence on the entrained gas , and the mixture experiences solar gravity as a unit .",
    "it attempts to move as an individual large object relative to the nebula gas , dragging the entrained gas along .",
    "for instance , a clump forming at some distance above the nebula midplane settles downward under the acceleration of the vertical component of solar gravity , whereas the surrounding gas remains under vertical hydrostatic balance .",
    "also , nebula gas generally orbits at a slower velocity than the keplerian orbit velocity @xmath130 obeyed by massive particles .",
    "this is because of its generally outward radial pressure gradient force @xmath131 , where @xmath45 is the distance from the sun , and @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus , particles experience a headwind with magnitude @xmath133 a few @xmath93 cm / sec . these headwinds result in a ram pressure @xmath134 which can disrupt a strengthless clump .",
    "for example , a dense drop of ink settling in a glass of water is quickly disrupted by the rayleigh - taylor instability and mixes with its surroundings ( thomson and newhall 1885 ) .",
    "however , a dense drop of fluid _ with surface tension _ can avoid disruption and settle indefinitely at terminal velocity ( as do raindrops , or water in oil ) .",
    "in this situation , the criterion for stability of a fluid droplet , which determines its terminal velocity and thence its size , is given by the weber number @xmath135 , where @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is the surface tension coefficient .",
    "drops are disrupted when @xmath138 exceeds some critical value @xmath139 ( pruppacher and klett 1997 ) .",
    "dense particle clumps in the nebula have no surface tension , but they do have self - gravity . by direct analogy with the droplet surface tension criterion , we define a _ gravitational weber number _ @xmath140 as the ratio of the ram pressure force per unit area to the self - gravitational force per unit area for a flattened disk , which is the initial stage of a strengthless spherical clump of diameter @xmath50 and particle density @xmath141 upon encountering a headwind @xmath142 ( thomson and newhall 1885 ) . for a disk of surface mass density @xmath143 ,",
    "the gravitational force per unit area is @xmath144 .",
    "then @xmath145 where @xmath146 is an effective drag coefficient for the clump , on the order of unity ( see appendix b ) .",
    "@xmath147 can be written in other ways as well .",

    "then we require for stability against headwind disruption that @xmath153 or @xmath154 these expressions determine the combination of clump diameter @xmath50 and particle loading @xmath37 that will stabilize it against a headwind of magnitude @xmath155 .",
    "the headwind due to nebula radial pressure gradient will occur even if a clump is at the midplane and has zero settling velocity ; this gives the lower limit on ram pressure that the clump must be stable against .",
    "neglecting vertical settling restricts potentially stable clumps to lying within about 0.01 gas scale heights of the midplane , where the headwind @xmath156 is comparable to the vertical settling velocity .",
    "this restriction must be factored into statistical estimates of planetesimal production ( see , e.g. cuzzi et al 2007 ) .    for typical nebula parameters ,",
    "we assume gas density to be in the range @xmath157 g @xmath61 ( a nominal minimum mass value ) to @xmath97 g @xmath61 ( a more recent value supported by nebula evolution and chondrule formation ; _ cf . _ desch et al 2005 ) , semimajor axis @xmath158 cm ( 2.5 au ) , pressure gradient / headwind parameter @xmath132 ( see , _ eg . _ ,",

    "some of the less common , very dense zones , which we have shown elsewhere can achieve mass densities 100 times larger than that of the gas , have the potential to become planetesimals depending on their lengthscales , nebula location , and local vorticity .",
    "it is intriguing that our characteristic stabilized clump masses are not far from the mass inferred by bottke et al ( 2005 ) to represent a typical primordial object in the pre - dispersal , pre - erosional asteroid belt .",
    "ultimately , the sandpiles resulting from completed sedimentation will become compacted further by inevitable collisions with other sandpiles , leading to today s fairly dense asteroids , while retaining a physical and chemical memory of their parent particle clumps .",

    ", hogan and cuzzi ( 2007 ) found that particle mass loading saturates the value of @xmath51 at a value of about 100 , redirecting our attention to larger clumps in the @xmath219 km size range .",
    "clumps and fluid structures of these large sizes are much more accessible with numerical codes , both of the standard direct simulation type and the cascade type ( appendix a ) .    in this scenario ,",
    "primitive bodies may not primarily represent spatial , but perhaps temporal , samples of the particulate contents of the nebula as its chemical , physical , and isotopic properties evolve over several myr . the temporal , as well as the spatial , variation in the physical , chemical and isotopic properties of the concentrated particles , which are being continually altered by thermal events and mineralogical alteration in the nebula gas ,",
    "can then help account for class - to - class variations between the chondrite groups .",
    "an implication of this drawn - out , inefficient process is that younger chondrite types should contain evidence of  leftovers \" or  refugees \" from earlier times , which escaped primary accretion .",

    "of course , it is well known that ancient cai minerals and less - ancient , less refractory amoeboid olivine aggregates are found alongside much younger objects in the same chondrites ( _ eg .",
    "_ scott and krot 2005 ) . also , the oldest chondrites ( cvs ) contain primarily type i chondrules ( which have an age observationally indistinguishable to that of cais ) and no ( more oxidized , heavier o - isotope ) type ii chondrules , while the younger ordinary chondrites contain a mixture of type i and type ii chondrules , some with hints of age variation even within a given chondrite ( kita et al 2005 ) .",
    "the oldest and first - formed objects are all likely to have melted from their abundant @xmath1al ( kleine et al 2005 , 2006 ; hevey and sanders 2006 ) , producing differentiated achondrites and metallic objects , so it is no longer possible to dissect their primordial components .    of course , the real world is more complicated .",
    "some complications are meteoritic : as only one example , co chondrites and ordinary chondrites appear to be about the same age ( younger than cv chondrites ) , but have very different chemical and isotopic properties ( kita et al 2005 ) , which would , in the context of this scenario , argue for some degree of spatial ( radial ? ) variation in the makeup of nebula particulates at that time anyway .    on the theoretical side , of course , self - consistent numerical models which follow clump evolution in realistic turbulence with headwinds and vertical settling need to be pursued , to check these preliminary assessments which make simplistic assumptions about the local headwind and assume isolated clumps .",
    "several recent studies have found that transient  pressure ridges \" arise in the gas in association with spiral density waves or vortical structures ( haghighipour and boss 2003 , rice et al 2004 , johansen et al 2007 ) ; in such regions , the local radial pressure gradient and headwind diminish ( other regions will have unusually _ large _ headwinds ) .",
    "moreover , clumps do not exist in isolation , but more realistically as a dense core within a larger , less dense envelope which weakens the headwind felt by the dense clump core relative to the nebula average we characterize by @xmath209 .",
    "both of these conditions would allow some clumps to survive with smaller @xmath214 .",
    "other complications include interactions between different strengthless objects , leading to mergers or disruptions .",
    "our stability criteria are most likely to be satisfied in a region fairly close to the nebula midplane ( @xmath220 , see section 3.3 ) , because at higher altitudes the vertical component of solar gravity leads to vertical settling of dense clumps at higher terminal velocities than are easily stabilized against . however ,",
    "this vertical settling , even if it leads quickly to disruption of individual clumps , enhances the downward transport rate of small particles and increases the solid / gas ratio closer to the midplane from that generally predicted by simple 1d diffusion models ( _ eg .",
    "_ , bosse et al 2006 ) .",
    "all these effects have implications for the occurrence frequency of clumps of the requisite @xmath214 for stability .",
    "quantitative statistical determinations of the volume fraction of stable clumps which can become planetesimals at any given time will use , for instance , approaches such as the cascade models described in appendix a. simplified , preliminary work exploring these factors indicates that , while the volume fraction of stable clumps is low at any given time ( so the process is clearly not an efficient one ) , accretion rates are roughly an earth mass per myr in the asteroid belt region ( cuzzi et al 2007 ) .",
    "however , considerable work remains to establish the statistical formation rate of appropriate clumps capable of following this evolutionary path and to study the evolution of clumps in realistic turbulence , with variable headwind velocity and simultaneous vertical settling .",

    "scale - independence and @xmath230independence are connected because @xmath116 determines the depth of the inertial range : @xmath231 ( tennekes and lumley 1972 ) .",
    "cascade models simplify this complex , nonlinear , 3d scale - free process into a set of partition rules which are independent of scale , or of _ level _ in the cascade .",

    "cascade models do nt preserve all the information of full 3d models ( such as the tubelike spatial structures characterizing vorticity ) but they do reproduce the statistical properties ( the pdfs ) , which are of primary importance for our problem . the successful use of such models to describe the intermittency of dissipation , and other quantities , in turbulence ( juneja et al 1994 , sreenivasan and stolovitsky 1995 ) led us to pursue a cascade model for turbulent concentration of particles .",
    "a cascade model consists of a set of  multipliers \" - fractions which define how a quantity of interest is unequally partitioned from a fluid parcel at some level , into its equal - sized subdivisions at the next level .",
    "the pdf of particle concentration factor @xmath5 is determined over all the numerous end - level outcomes of applying a multiplier @xmath233 ( chosen from its own pdf @xmath223 ) to each volume element as it bifurcates at each level of the cascade .",
    "it has been observed that @xmath223 is independent of level in the turbulent inertial range ( sreenivasan and stolovitsky 1995 ) .",
    "hence , multiplier pdfs determined from a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) at low @xmath116 ( with a relatively small number of levels ) , merely applied repeatedly over additional levels , can _ predict _ the properties at higher @xmath116 ( if nothing changes in the physics ) . our cascade model (",
    "hogan and cuzzi 2007 ) uses a common form for @xmath223 : @xmath234 , where the parameter @xmath222 determines the width of @xmath223 ( sreenivasan and stolovitsky 1995 ) .",
    "both the concentration @xmath5 and the vorticity @xmath120 are described by their own @xmath222-distributions .",

    "pdfs with large @xmath237 are narrow and centered on @xmath236 ; because each  eddy bifurcation \" then involves a nearly 50 - 50 partitioning , the resulting spatial distribution is nearly uniform and subsequent growth of @xmath37 becomes more difficult .    the cascade model can then be used to address the issue of how particle mass loading can affect the cascade - that is , change the physics as the cascade progresses .",
    "this dependence is known as _ conditioning _ of a cascade .",
    "we found that the process can be represented quite well as two separate _",
    "one - phase _ conditioned cascades for @xmath5 and @xmath120 in which multiplier distributions @xmath223 for both @xmath5 and @xmath120 depend only on the local particle mass loading @xmath37 .",

    "hogan and cuzzi ( 2007 ) found , on average , a 70 - 30 preference for anticorrelation at each partitioning , consistent with previous observations that particle concentration zones avoid zones of high fluid vorticity ( squires and eaton 1990 , 1991 ; eaton and fessler 1994 ; ahmed and elghobashi 2000 , 2001 ) . including this partitioning asymmetry factor as a weighted coin gives us a two - phase ( particle - gas ) , conditioned cascade model which shows very good agreement with the joint pdf @xmath242 directly determined from our full 3d mass loaded simulations ( see hogan and cuzzi 2007 ) .",
    "however , to match the full 3d dns simulations at @xmath243 , the cascade model needs only about 15 levels , taking about 10 cpu - hours ( for 1024 realizations ) compared to over 90000 cpu hours to converge our full 3d simulation .    using these conditioned multipliers and asymmetry factor , entire pdfs of particle concentration ( mass loading ) and vorticity can be generated for arbitrary numbers of levels ( arbitrary @xmath116 ) .",

    "that is , we want @xmath269 to be large enough such that the clump is well resolved , but not so large that it fills the entire cross section of the computational box . typically @xmath269 is only 10 - 20 grid cells so far , and as noted below , this exaggerates the viscous stresses and surficial erosion of material .",
    "we want @xmath37 to be large enough that the clump is much denser than the gas , and we want a large enough number of particles to act like a continuum .",
    "the value of @xmath20 should ensure that the clump sedimentation time @xmath53 is larger than its ram pressure disruption time @xmath272 ( see below ) , to provide a real test that self - gravity is preserving the clump rather than simple collapse .",
    "the dynamical collapse time of the clump under its own self - gravity , and in the absence of gas pressure , is @xmath273 , or in code units @xmath274 .",
    "the mass loading which produces a clump dynamical time comparable to the orbit time is then obtained using @xmath275 or @xmath276 , again in fair agreement with prior expectations .",
    "however , gas drag prevents clump collapse on this timescale , as described in section 3.1 , and actual shrinkage takes a time @xmath53 ( eqn .",

    "this behavior ( @xmath280 ) can be controlled in the code , once the other parameters are established as above , by adjusting the particle stopping time @xmath20 . because of long code run times , at present we are limited to stipulating only that the sedimentation time significantly exceeds the nominal ( self - gravity - free ) disruption time ; that is , @xmath281 , where @xmath282 this expression for the disruption time @xmath272 is derived from the ram pressure force ( sect 2.3 ) by setting the distance traveled in time @xmath195 by the windward half of the clump , under acceleration by the ram pressure force , equal to the clump diameter ( assuming the leeward half of the clump does nt get accelerated ) , and solving for @xmath195 .",
    "the value of @xmath146 for our clumps is on the order of unity , as we verify below .",
    "the code calls for some input viscosity @xmath283 ; with it , the reynolds number of the clump having diameter @xmath269 radians , in a headwind of speed @xmath284 ( in code units of radians per ctu ) , is @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the defined code viscosity ( radians@xmath287/ctu ) .",

    "this means that viscous stresses around the periphery of the clump , and the fractional depth of the viscous boundary layer , are grossly exaggerated in the numerical model relative to the actual nebula regime of interest .",
    "the anomalously large role of ( numerical ) viscosity leads to anomalously large  erosion \" from the surface of our numerical clumps , and degrades our results in the sense that potentially stable clumps _",
