    "many studies on the possible magnetic field decay of neutron stars ( nss ) have been done previously , based on the observed statistics of their periods ( @xmath3 ) and period derivatives ( @xmath4 ) . some of these studies relied on a population synthesis of pulsars ( holt & ramaty 1970 ; bhattacharya et al . 1992 ; han 1997 ; regimbau & de freitas pacheco 2001 ; tauris & konar 2001 ; gonthier et al .",
    "2002 ; guseinov et al .",
    "2004 ; aguilera et al .",
    "2008 ; popov et al .",
    "2010 ) ; however , no firm conclusion can be drawn on if and how the magnetic fields of nss decay ( e.g. , harding & lai 2006 ; ridley & lorimer 2010 ; lorimer 2011 ) .",
    "alternatively some other studies used the spin - down or characteristics ages , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the initial spin period of the given pulsar ) , or @xmath7 if @xmath8 , as indicators of the true ages of nss and found evidence for their dipole magnetic field decay ( pacini 1969 ; ostriker & gunn 1969 ; gunn & ostriker 1970 ) .",
    "however , as we have shown recently ( zhang & xie 2011 ) , their spin - down ages are normally significantly larger than the ages of the supernova remnants physically associated with them , which in principle should be the unbiased age indicators of these nss ( lyne 1975 ; geppert et al . , 1999 ; ruderman 2005 ) .",
    "it has been shown that this age mismatch can be understood if the magnetic fields of these nss decay significantly over their life times , since the magnetic field decay alters the spin - down rate of a ns significantly , and thus cause the observed age mismatch ( lyne 1975 ; geppert et al .",
    "1999 ; ruderman 2005 ; zhang & xie 2011 ) .",
    "pulsars are generally very stable natural clocks with observed steady pulses .",
    "however significant timing irregularities , i.e. , unpredicted times of arrival of pulses , exist for most pulsars studied so far ( see hobbs et al .",
    "2010 , for an extensive reviews of many previous studies on timing irregularities of pulsars ) .",
    "the timing irregularities of the first type are  glitches \" , i.e. , sudden increases in spin rate followed by a period of relaxation ; it has been found that the timing irregularities of young pulsars with @xmath9 years are dominated by the recovery from previous glitch events ( hobbs et al .",
    "2010 ) . in many cases",
    "the ns recovers to the spin rate prior to the glitch event and thus the glitch event can be removed from the data satisfactorily without causing significant residuals over model predictions .",
    "however in some cases , glitches can cause permanent changes to both @xmath3 and @xmath10 of the ns , which can not always be removed from the data satisfactorily , for instance , if the glitch has occurred before the start of the data taking and/or long term recoveries from glitch events can not be modeled satisfactorily .",
    "these changes can be modeled as a permanent increase of the surface dipole magnetic field of the ns ; consequently some of these nss may grow their surface magnetic field strength gradually this way and eventually have surface magnetic field strength comparable to that of magnetars over a life time of 10@xmath11 years ( lin & zhang 2004 ) .",
    "these are the first studies that linked the timing irregularities of pulsars with the long term evolution of magnetic fields of nss .",
    "the timing irregularities of the second type have time scales of years to decades and thus are normally referred to as timing noise ( hobbs et al . 2004 ; 2010 ) .",
    "hobbs et al . ( 2004 , 2010 ) carried out so far the most extensive study of the long term timing irregularities of 366 pulsars . besides ruling out some timing noise models in terms of observational imperfections , random walks , and planetary companions , hobbs et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2010 ) concluded that the observed @xmath0 values for the majority of pulsars are not caused by magnetic dipole radiation or by any other systematic loss of rotational energy , but are dominated by the amount of timing noise present in the residuals and the data span .",
    "some of their main results that are modeled and interpreted in this work are : ( 1 ) all young pulsars have @xmath12 ; ( 2 ) approximately half of the older pulsars have @xmath12 and the other half have @xmath13 ; ( 3 ) quasi - oscillatory timing residuals are observed for many pulsars ; and ( 4 ) the value of @xmath0 measured depends upon the data span and the exact choice of data processed .",
    "proper understanding of these important results can lead to better understanding of the internal structures and the magnetospheres of nss . since the spin evolution of pulsars can not be caused by any systematic loss of rotational energy ( hobbs et al .",
    "2004 ; 2010 ) , it is natural to introduce some oscillatory parameters .",
    "indeed , some of the observed periodicities have been suggested as being caused by free - precession of the ns ( stairs et al .",
    "some strong quasi - periodicities have been identified recently as due to abrupt changes of the magnetospheric regulation of nss , perhaps due to varied particle emissions ( lyne et al .",
    "it was suggested that such varied magnetospheric particle emissions is also responsible for the observed long term timing noise ( liu et al .",
    "alternatively it has been suggested that the propagation of tkachenko waves in a ns may modulate its moment of inertia , and thus produce the observed periodic or quasi - periodic timing noise ( tkachenko 1966 ; ruderman 1970 ; haskell 2011 ) . because all of the above processes can only cause periodic or quasi - period modulations to the observed spin of nss",
    ", all these modulations can be modeled phenomenologically as some sort of oscillations of the observed surface magnetic field strengths of nss .",
    "it is thus reasonable to attribute the observed wide - spread quasi - oscillatory timing residuals to the oscillations of the magnetic fields of nss . as shown in this work",
    ", the oscillating magnetic fields can also naturally explain the fact that approximately half of the older pulsars have @xmath12 and the other half have @xmath13 , when the long term magnetic field decay does not dominate the spin evolutions of pulsars .",
    "this is the main advantage of this model , and thus justifies invoking oscillating magnetic fields for modeling the long term spin evolutions of pulsars .    in this work",
    "we attempt to use the known statistical properties of the spin evolution of the pulsars to test some phenomenological models for the evolution of the dipole magnetic field of a ns . in sections 2 - 5 , we test the following three models : ( 1 ) the standard magnetic dipole radiation model with constant magnetic field , ( 2 ) * * long - term exponential decay with an oscillatory component and ( 3 ) long - term power - law decay modulated with oscillations .",
    "we find the last model is the only one compatible with the data , with the power - law index @xmath14 and the oscillation amplitude of around @xmath15 for an oscillation period of several years .",
    "finally we discuss the physical implication of our results , summarize our results and make conclusions and discussions , including predictions of the model for further studies .",
    "all timing data of pulsars used in this work are taken from hobbs et al .",
    "assuming pure magnetic dipole radiation as the braking mechanism for a pulsar s spin - down , we have , @xmath16 or , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is normally assumed to be a constant , @xmath1 is its dipole magnetic field at its magnetic pole , @xmath19 is its radius , @xmath20 is its moment of inertia . assuming @xmath21 , we have , @xmath22 this model thus predicts @xmath23 , against the fact that many pulsars show @xmath24 .",
    "this is a major failure of this model , or any other models with monotonic spin - down , as pointed out in hobbs et al .",

    "clearly @xmath36 for most pulsars .",
    "this suggests that if the measured @xmath0 values are caused by magnetic field evolution , then the evolution must be significant for most pulsars in the sample .",
    "[ fig:2 ] also shows that for all young pulsars with @xmath37  yr , @xmath38 , i.e. , their magnetic moment field decays with time . for the rest of pulsars",
    ", there are almost equal numbers of pulsars with positive or negative @xmath39 . if one assumes that most pulsars are born with some common properties and they then evolve to have the observed statistical properties , it is then necessary that at least some pulsars should have both @xmath38 and @xmath40 at different times , i.e. , @xmath31 oscillates .",
    "we therefore model phenomenologically the evolution of the observed dipole magnetic field of a pulsar by a decay modulated by the dominated component of oscillations , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the pulsar s age , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the amplitude , phase and period of the oscillating magnetic field , respectively",
    ". sometimes it might be necessary to take multiple oscillation components since multiple peaks are often seen in the power spectra of the timing residuals of many pulsars ( hobbs et al .",

    "we only consider the amplitude of the oscillation term to model the statistical properties of the timing noise of pulsars , i.e. , @xmath49 since @xmath50 can produce @xmath51 , a viable model should at least have @xmath52 for young pulsars and _ vice versa _ for old pulsars , in order to produce positive @xmath53 for young pulsars , but either positive or negative @xmath53 for old pulsars with almost equal chances , as discussed above .",

    "statistically these numbers are indistinguishable .",
    "therefore about half of pulsars in this sample are observed with increasing or decreasing magnetic fields .",
    "several physical mechanisms have been proposed for magnetic field decay in nss , e.g. , ohmic dissipation , hall effect , and ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we can therefore have ( goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ; heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) , @xmath108 where @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( for the solenoidal component ) , @xmath111 ( for the irrotational component ) , and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the surface magnetic field strength in units of 10@xmath114  g , @xmath115 denotes the core temperature in units of @xmath116  k , @xmath117  g  @xmath118 is the nuclear density , and @xmath119 is a characteristic length scale of the flux loops through the outer core in units of @xmath120  cm .",
    "assuming @xmath115 does not vary or only varies slowly with time ( pons et al .",
    "2009 ) , the ohmic dissipation will produce an exponential decay of the magnetic field , @xmath121 .",
    "the other two mechanisms all produce power - law decay , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 or @xmath86 for the hall effect or ambipolar diffusion ( for @xmath124  yr ) , respectively .",
    "we recently found that this model with constant core temperatures of nss can explain well the observed age mismatch of nss discussed above , and the ambipolar diffusion effect seems to be dominant , though the statistics is rather limited ( zhang & xie 2011 ; xie & zhang 2011 )    as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3 ] ) and discussed in sect .",
    "3 , the simple exponential decay can not describe the data for young pulsars with @xmath125  yr .",
    "therefore a constant core temperature ( @xmath126 ) ohmic dissipation model for all magnetic field decay is ruled out .",
    "however , for a cooling ns , i.e. , @xmath115 decreases with time , the ohmic dissipation model would result in an increasing @xmath61 with time , in rough agreement with that shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3])(b ) . indeed ,",
    "an increasing @xmath61 with time would also make the first term in eq .",
    "( [ ddot_exp ] ) less important or negligible for old pulsars , thus explaining why there are almost equal number of pulsars with either positive or negative @xmath0 . of course",
    "an increasing @xmath61 with time may be able to mimic a power - law decay mathematically .    as shown in figs .",
    "( [ fig:4]-[fig:9 ] ) and discussed in sects . 4 and 5",
    ", a power - law decay with @xmath127 can explain all the observed statistical properties of the timing noise of pulsars .",
    "unfortunately the exact value or even the upper limit of @xmath81 can not be constrained by the data , though @xmath128 is preferred .",
    "for both the hall effect and the ambipolar diffusion ( for @xmath124  yr ) , a cooling ns implies faster magnetic field decay , and thus increasing @xmath81 with time .",
    "we therefore conclude that the current data do not conflict the above discussed model of magnetic field decay of nss , but also can not constrain precisely how these effects regulate their magnetic field decay .      as demonstrated in sect .",
    "5 , invoking an oscillation component with @xmath129  s@xmath130 , both the amplitude and signs of @xmath0 can be well reproduced for all pulsars .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations with time scales of the order of years in the timing residuals of pulsars are found to be quite common ( hobbs et al . 2010 ) . as we have shown recently , such quasi - periodic oscillations can be re - produced by an oscillating dipole magnetic field of a ns with an oscillation period of several years ( zhang & xie 2012 ) .",
    "taking @xmath131  years and @xmath123 , we have the oscillation amplitude of the observed magnetic field @xmath132 .    assuming that these oscillations are caused by precessing of the ns and the angle between its magnetic and spin axes is 60 degrees",
    ", @xmath132 requires a precession angle of about 0.003 degree , which is much smaller than the inferred 0.3 degree precession angle for psr  b1828@xmath13311 from its periodic timing properties ( stairs et al .",
    "therefore psr  b1828@xmath13311 is probably an extreme example showing observed oscillating magnetic fields , though our result suggests that the same phenomenon exists in essentially all pulsars .",
    "of course the apparent oscillations of their observed magnetic fields may also be caused by periodic or quasi - periodic changes of their magnetospheres ( lyne et al .",
    "2010 ; liu et al .",
    "2010 ) , or even their moments of inertia caused by , for example , the tkachenko waves in nss .",
    "regardless which mechanism is responsible for the oscillations , the mechanism appear to work in the same way for all types of nss , since the distribution of @xmath97 is quite narrow ( especially when @xmath123 ) , and @xmath88 does not appear to be correlated with any observed parameters of pulsars .",
    "in this work we have tested models of magnetic field evolution of nss with the statistical properties of their timing noise reported by hobbs et al . ( 2010 ) . in all models",
    "the magnetic dipole radiation is assumed to dominate the spin - down of pulsars ; therefore different models of their magnetic field evolution lead to different properties of their spin - down .",

    "this model also fails to predict @xmath63 , which is observed in nearly half of the old pulsars .",
    "the standard model of pulsar s magnetosphere with constant magnetic field is thus ruled out , and @xmath0 is found to be dominated by the varying magnetic field .",
    "\\(2 ) statistically about half of the pulsars in this sample show increasing or decreasing magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic field strength of most pulsars are found to either increase or decrease with time scales significantly shorter than their characteristic ages ( fig .",

    "\\(4 ) a simple exponential decay is not favored by the apparent correlation of the inferred decay constant with their characteristic ages for young pulsars ( fig .",

    "\\(5 ) a simple power - law decay , however , can explain all the observed statistical properties of @xmath0 ( figs .",

    "( [ fig:7 ] and [ fig:8 ] ) ) .",
    "we thus conclude that long term magnetic field and short term oscillations are ubiquitous in all nss and that the data support the model consisting of a power - law decay modulated by short term oscillations for the evolution of their magnetic fields .",

    "( [ fig:4 ] ) and ( [ fig:8])(b ) ) .",

    ", @xmath81 can be determined directly with eq .",
    "( [ ddot_p1 ] ) ; @xmath134 can be safely assumed for young pulsars .",
    "unfortunately only several pulsars in the sample of hobbs et al ( 2010 ) have the ages of their supernova remnants available , thus preventing a statistically meaningful determination of @xmath81 this way .",
    "we thus suggest that reliable determination of the true ages of a large sample of young nss is needed , in order to constrain further the physical mechanisms of the magnetic field decay of nss .",
    "this can also provide an independent test of our model .",
    "the main prediction of this model is that the spin evolution of each pulsar should follow , @xmath135 where both @xmath136 and @xmath137 should be time - resolved , rather than the averaged value conventionally reported over the whole data span .",

    "as discussed above , the first or the second term in the above equation may be ignored for old millisecond pulsars or young pulsars , respectively .",

    "<S> we test models for the evolution of neutron star ( ns ) magnetic fields ( b ) . our model for the evolution of the ns spin </S>",
    "<S> is taken from an analysis of pulsar timing noise presented by hobbs et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first test the standard model of a pulsar s magnetosphere in which b does not change with time and magnetic dipole radiation is assumed to dominate the pulsar s spin - down . </S>",
    "<S> we find this model fails to predict both the magnitudes and signs of the second derivatives of the spin frequencies ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then construct a phenomenological model of the evolution of @xmath1 , which contains a long term decay ( ltd ) modulated by short term oscillations ( sto ) ; a pulsar s spin is thus modified by its b - evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that an exponential ltd is not favored by the observed statistical properties of @xmath0 for young pulsars and fails to explain the fact that @xmath0 is negative for roughly half of the old pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> a simple power - law ltd can explain all the observed statistical properties of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss some physical implications of our results to models of the @xmath1-decay of nss and suggest reliable determination of the true ages of many young nss is needed , in order to constrain further the physical mechanisms of their @xmath1-decay . </S>",
    "<S> our model can be further tested with the measured evolutions of @xmath2 and @xmath0 for an individual pulsar ; the decay index , oscillation amplitude and period can also be determined this way for the pulsar . </S>"
