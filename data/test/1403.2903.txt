    "self - assembly of nanoparticles is an important tool in nanotechnology , and an active area of interdisciplinary research , with applications spanning a variety of fields such as optics , materials science , electronics , and nanomedicine @xcite .",
    "there are a multitude of experimental techniques that take advantage of the natural tendency of particles to self - assembly due to chemical bonds @xcite .",
    "one of the most intuitive and cost - effective methods for creating thin films , for example , is layer - by - layer self - assembly , also known as ionic self - assembly of monolayers , or isam .",
    "it was first introduced by iler @xcite and later used in the creation of antireflective coatings @xcite . to create the thin films , layers of cations and anions",
    "are deposited by alternately dipping the substrate in aqueous solutions of appropriate ions .",
    "the same principle is used for other types of applications , such as the creation of thin films using nanotubes @xcite , and drug attachment and encapsulation of nanoparticles using synthetic dendrimers @xcite .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to present a stochastic statistical physics model that encapsulates the essential features of the self - assembly of ionic nanoparticles from a colloidal suspension onto a glass substrate .",
    "the model is validated by experiments conducted in our lab that show the effect of the concentration of the colloidal suspension on the nanoparticle coverage of a glass substrate .",
    "analytical and computational models of sequential adsorption have proven successful in describing diverse physical systems ranging from surface deposition and chemisorption on crystal surfaces @xcite to epidemic problems @xcite and voting behavior @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of nanoparticle deposition is another application of such models .",
    "it is currently an active area of research in nanotechnology studies @xcite which addresses interesting open questions on the theoretical front @xcite .",
    "two classes of models that have been particularly successful are _ random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) @xcite , in which particles are adsorbed / deposited at a fixed rate at random unoccupied sites on a grid , and _ cooperative sequential adsorption ( csa ) @xcite , in which adsorption rates depend upon the occupation of neighboring sites .",
    "one - dimensional sequential adsorption models have been studied thoroughly in different physical contexts @xcite , but adsorption in two dimensions is less understood .",
    "there are many computational adsorption models @xcite , but few analytical solutions have been developed for the general two - dimensional case .",
    "recently , analytical results have been reported for the random sequential process @xcite and reaction - diffusion processes on cayley trees and bethe lattices @xcite . adding the possibility of particle detachment , or _ evaporation",
    "_ , to such models brings additional complications .",
    "one of the standard tools used to study these systems , the _ empty - interval method _ @xcite , fails when evaporation is considered .",
    "evaporation has been treated analytically in a few studies of one - dimensional systems using a quantum mechanical approach @xcite . _ _",
    "we will describe the isam process using a _ stochastic cooperative sequential adsorption with evaporation _ ( csae ) model on two - dimensional lattices .",
    "these methods are ideally suited for modeling isam since the deposition process of nanoparticles is stochastic and the deposited nanoparticles are electrically charged , as are the substrate deposition sites , suggesting a cooperative sequential adsorption model with deposition rates dependent on nearest - neighbor site occupation .",
    "the general csae model that we utilize leads to analytical solutions for the particle density .",
    "in order to validate the model , we conducted an experimental study of the effect of the colloidal suspension concentration on the steady state coverage density of the glass substrate .",
    "the analytical results are compared to the experimental data and to monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "we found excellent agreement between the three methods .    in the following section of this paper ,",
    "we describe the isam process and our experimental results for the concentration dependence of the coverage density . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we present the analytical model and its mean field solution .",
    "section [ comparison ] is dedicated to a comparison between experiment , theory , and the monte carlo simulations .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss some open questions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the use of ionic self - assembled monolayers allows detailed structural control of materials at the nanoscale , combined with ease of manufacturing and low cost .",
    "the isam process allows the deposition of alternating layers of cations and anions by dipping a substrate in aqueous solutions of the appropriate ions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    ", width=325 ]    because it is a dipping process , any exposed surface is homogeneously coated , allowing highly uniform , conformal coatings on irregular shapes .",
    "the basic building block for the film is a cation / anion bilayer , which may consist of either two polyelectrolytes ( a polycation and a polyanion ) , a polyelectrolyte and a nanoparticle , or two different nanoparticles .",
    "the thickness of a bilayer is a function of the diameter of the nanoparticle and the packing of the particles from layer to layer .",
    "the optical properties of the resulting film can be tuned by the choice of nanoparticles and by the number of bilayers deposited .",
    "a comprehensive review of the technique and its applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "although there are numerous studies on the subject of thin - film characterization @xcite , the goal of creating thin films with a graded index of refraction is still outstanding . a study published by yancey et al .",
    "@xcite shows that the coverage of the substrate plays an important role in tuning the index of refraction of the thin film .",
    "the maxwell - garnett approximation @xcite , in fact , predicts that the index of refraction depends on surface coverage .    in our experiments we deposited",
    "negatively charged spherical silica nanoparticles of nominal 40 - 50 nm diameter on negatively charged glass slides using poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride ) ( pdda ) as polycation .",
    "the silica nanoparticles ( snowtex st-20l from nissan chemical ) were in a colloidal suspension at stable @xmath0 and room temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the glass slides were cleaned under sonication , in three successive twenty - minute steps , with labtone detergent , 1n sodium hydroxide solution , and deionized water , and then dried with flowing nitrogen gas .",
    "the dipping time was ten minutes for each bilayer .",
    "we varied the concentration of the silica suspension by diluting it with deionized water .",
    "we examined the nanoparticle coverage of the substrate using sem micrographs , in which deposited particles appear as light regions on a dark background .",
    "a sample sem micrograph is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    , width=325 ]    we processed two single - bilayer micrographs for each concentration data point . using an automated pixel - counting method we determined the average coverage of light pixels , representing presence of deposited particles .",
    "the experimental data is presented in section [ comparison ] , alongside and compared to the analytical solution .",
    "we model the glass slide uniformly covered by the pdda polymer as a finite two - dimensional lattice with @xmath2 total sites .",
    "we consider the silica nanoparticles as charged monomers that attach to and detach from the lattice sites .",
    "we define an occupation number @xmath3 for an empty site and @xmath4 for an occupied site .",
    "our model considers both evaporation of monomers and deposition of monomers with rates dependent on the number of occupied neighbors .",
    "we define the following transition rate for the particle occupation : @xmath5 the first term in the transition rate is the evaporation term : if a particle is present , it will evaporate with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the second term describes the deposition of monomers .",
    "if the lattice cell is empty , a monomer will attach with a rate equal to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of occupied nearest neighbors .",
    "when @xmath9 ( no nearest neighbors present ) , the intrinsic deposition rate is @xmath10 .",
    "the rate @xmath11 attenuates this intrinsic deposition rate based on the number of occupied nearest neighbors .",
    "given this transition rate , the number of particles on the lattice changes according to the following equation : @xmath12      in order to find the equation that governs the time dependence of the overall particle density , we take the ensemble average of @xmath13 : @xmath14 since this equation contains higher order correlations , we employ the mean field technique , which allows for the correlations to be approximated as : @xmath15 using this approximation , we arrive at the following equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we see that the size of a particle is much less than the size of the slide . as",
    "such , edge effects due to the finite size of the slide should be negligible in the interior of the slide .",
    "additionally , we see a uniform distribution of particles on the slide . from these two observations",
    ", we find that the coverage density is independent of the location on the slide .",
    "therefore , the average site density @xmath18 is the same as the overall average coverage density @xmath19 : @xmath20 using this information leads to a rate equation for the particle density : @xmath21    for the steady state , @xmath22 , this is a self - consistent transcendental equation that can be solved numerically : @xmath23 eq .",
    "can be solved numerically using standard software such as maple or mathematica . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present the time dependent particle density for three different values of @xmath11 ( 0.1 , 0.5 , and 0.9 ) at a fixed @xmath24 and @xmath25 .     with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the three values of @xmath11 shown are ( black , dashed line ) 0.1 , ( red , dot - dashed line ) 0.5 , and ( green , solid line ) 0.9.[fig3],width=325 ]    for all three @xmath11 s the shape of these curves is the same , but the steady state values of the particle density are drastically different . a more in - depth analysis of the steady state coverage is required and will be presented in section [ comparison ] , in connection with its dependence on concentration .    from a theoretical point of view , it is worth noting that eq .",
    "can be generalized for any coordination number @xmath26 , as :    @xmath27    the solution of this mean field equation can be obtained for a generic geometry with an effective coordination ( per site ) @xmath26 .",
    "such a solution would show that a different coordination number ( in the mean field limit ) just corresponds to a different effective @xmath11 , i.e. , the parameter would be @xmath28 rather than @xmath11 .",
    "because we are comparing our analytical results to a very specific experiment , we discus in this article just the particular case of a square lattice of coordination number @xmath29 and @xmath30 , to simulate electrostatic screening .",
    "the case of @xmath31 corresponds to a physical situation in which the presence of occupied neighbors favors adsorption .",
    "this choice can apply to a voter- or an epidemic - type model .",
    "the numerical solutions for @xmath31 are very similar in shape to the ones presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath30 .",
    "the main difference is the increased rate at which the lattice fills up to @xmath32 coverage .",
    "the cooperative aspects of the model disappear for @xmath33 ; it becomes a langmuir model @xcite .",
    "we arrive at the same self - consistent transcendental equation for the particle density in the steady state if we approach the problem in the context of the ising model on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian associated with the two - dimensional ising model of a system of @xmath2 spins in an external field is : @xmath34    the first term describes the interactions between nearest - neighbor spins , and the second term expresses the interaction between each spin and an external magnetic field @xmath35 .",
    "the spin numbers are @xmath36 for a spin up , and @xmath37 for for a spin down .",
    "we can map our model onto an equivalent spin model , in which the spin numbers are related to the occupation numbers @xmath13 , @xmath38 . using the detailed balance condition",
    ", we can solve for the coupling constants in terms of the defined attachment and detachment rates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath6 : @xmath39    the equation derived for the magnetization of a system of spins in an external magnetic field in the mean field approximation is @xcite : @xmath40 with the coupling constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 found above , and @xmath43 , we arrive at a transcendental equation identical to eq .  .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations on a two - dimensional square lattice in order to investigate the dynamics of the csae process and evaluate the steady state solutions under various parameter regimes .",
    "our simulations utilize a @xmath44 two - dimensional grid onto which particles are both deposited at empty sites and evaporated from filled sites . in order to minimize edge effects ,",
    "data is recorded for only the @xmath45 matrix at the center of the larger lattice .",
    "the interior of the lattice is chosen instead of periodic boundary conditions ; this choice mimics what is done experimentally .",
    "only a small portion of the glass slide is analyzed , which is typically far away from the edges of the slide .",
    "the edges in the simulations have a higher average site density due to the reduced number of neighbors .",
    "additionally , the average site density near the edges in the simulation decays rapidly to the average bulk density as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - edge ] for the left edge .",
    "similar results are seen for the other edges .",
    "edge effects were not seen in the sem micrographs , which is another reason we only consider the interior of the lattice .",

    "particles evaporate from filled cells with the rate @xmath6 , which is independent of the state of neighboring sites .",
    "to update a site , a random site is chosen .",
    "if the site is occupied , the particle will evaporate with rate @xmath6 .",
    "if the site is empty , then it will become occupied with rate @xmath49 . to make the simulation reach the steady state more efficiently ,",
    "we only consider updates that change the configuration of the lattice . a different reaction ( evaporation , adsorption with no neighbors , adsorption with one neighbor , etc . )",
    "is randomly chosen .",
    "we weight the choice of each reaction by the number of sites which would allow this reaction multiplied by the rate of the reaction .",
    "once a reaction is chosen , a site with the given reaction is randomly chosen to change . starting with an empty lattice , we allow the system to reach steady state by waiting @xmath50 site updates .",
    "we then average the particle density at steady state over 100 realizations of the system .    for physical systems with repulsion between particles ,",
    "the rate of deposition decreases when neighboring sites are occupied .",
    "we model this situation by choosing @xmath11 to be between zero and one for all simulations . a simple rescaling of time in eq",
    ".   shows that the ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath6 controls the steady state density .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath25 and vary @xmath6 without loss of generality .    as seen in fig .  [ fig5 ] , the mean field result is in excellent agreement with the simulation results    and captures the relevant dynamics of this model for @xmath51 .",
    "additionally , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig5b ] that the density as a function of @xmath11 could be approximated by a linear function for @xmath51 . at smaller values of @xmath11 , the mean field theory fails to agree with the simulation due to stronger spatial correlation , which the theory neglects .",
    "since the simulation models an isam , we now look at connecting this linear dependence to a similar one found in the experimental data .",
    "our csae model considers a simple case of deposition and evaporation of monomers and yields a transcendental equation for the particle density of the steady state that can be solved numerically . for the proposed model ,",
    "the equation associated with the steady state is re - written here for convenience : @xmath52    the experimental data shows a linear dependence between the particle density and the inverse of concentration . using our model",

    "the attachment and detachment rates can be chosen to reflect nearest - neighbor attraction ( @xmath31 ) and repulsion ( @xmath30 ) .",
