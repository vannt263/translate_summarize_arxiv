    "although cepheids have been studied extensively since the discovery by leavitt in 1908 of their fundamental period - luminosity ( pl ) relationship , the metallicity dependence of this relation still remains unsettled ( see tanvir 1997 for a review ) .",
    "since the cepheid pl relationship is a cornerstone to extragalactic distance scales , the existence of such dependence is of fundamental importance .",
    "this old debate has recently been revived due to high - quality observations from the hst , hipparcos and the micro - lensing experiments which collected large samples of cepheid data in the magellanic clouds ( eros : renault et al .",

    "sekiguchi and fukigita ( 1998 ) reanalysed cepheid data used as calibrators and claimed also a large metallicity effect .",
    "such controversy with previous claims ( see tanvir 1997 ) illustrates the difficulty to disentangle a metallicity effect from other effects such as reddening or distance uncertainties and to reach definitive conclusions .",
    "since empirical calibrations do not provide a clear answer to the metallicity correction , a theoretical analysis could provide the basis for a better understanding of this problem .",
    "however , uncertainties inherent to stellar evolution models ( convection treatment , overshooting , opacities , etc .. ) , pulsation calculations ( nonlinear effects , time - dependent convection ) and atmosphere models required to determine the bolometric corrections render the task difficult .",
    "one of the most systematic study has been performed by chiosi , wood & capitanio ( 1993 ) , based on linear stability analysis of a large grid of models with different compositions , effective temperatures , masses and mass - luminosity ( ml ) relationships .",
    "the metallicity effect on the pl relationship was found to be rather small",
    ". however , the models of chiosi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) are based on the old los alamos opacity library ( huebner et al .",

    "their analysis , which covers a mass range from 5 to 11 @xmath2 predicts a significant dependence of the pl relationship on metals , in contradiction with the results of saio and gautschy ( 1998 ) , although for similar mass and metallicity ranges .    in parallel with the work of saio and gautschy ( 1998 ) , baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) performed self - consistent calculations between stellar evolution and linear stability analysis for the smc , the lmc and the galaxy .",

    "( 1998 ) have emphasized the importance of the first crossing instability phase , which corresponds to models which are just leaving the main sequence and evolving toward the red giant branch on a thermal time - scale .",
    "such models can explain most of the first - overtone / second - overtone ( 1h/2h ) beat cepheids observed in the magellanic clouds ( mc ) .",
    "an other important result stressed in baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is the possible explanation by pure evolutionary effects of the change of slope in the pl relationship observed by bauer et al .",

    "the ratio @xmath6 of the mixing length ( @xmath7 ) to the pressure scale height ( @xmath8 ) is fixed to 1.5 . in order to determine the uncertainties resulting from a variation of @xmath7 , we have also computed two sets of evolutionary tracks with @xmath9 for metallicities representative of the mc s , for which more cepheid data ( fundamental and overtone pulsators ) are available than for the galaxy .",
    "the onset of convective instability is based on the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "our main grid of evolutionary models is computed with standard input physics ( e.g without overshooting , semiconvection , or rotation induced mixing ) . in order to test the effect of some enhanced mixing in the convective core ,",
    "as expected when using overshooting , we have also computed models in which the size of the convective core is arbitrarily increased by an amount @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a free parameter fixed to 0.15 , as justified in  2.3 and  4.5 .",
    "this extended region is assumed to be completely mixed , but the temperature gradient is supposed to be radiative .",
    "this type of simple prescription is usually used to mimic the effect of overshooting or any other source of enhanced mixing beyond the standard convective boundary ( cf .",

    "as shown in fig . 1 , @xmath21 decreases with metallicity .",
    "we find for the fundamental mode is @xmath22 for @xmath0=0.004 , @xmath23 for @xmath0=0.01 and @xmath24 for @xmath0=0.02 .",
    "note that baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mention slightly lower @xmath21 for @xmath0=0.01 and @xmath0=0.02 , but as shown in  3 , these lower values are too uncertain due to the arbitrary criterion used to determine the red edge .",
    "1 displays the evolutionary tracks of stars of mass @xmath21 for different metallicities and the location of fundamental unstable models ( see  3 for the description of the linear stability analysis ) .",
    "stars with masses just below @xmath21 undergo a reduced blue loop which does not enter the instability strip .",
    "note that all stellar models in fig .",
    "1 show fundamental unstable modes during the first crossing of the hertzsprung - russel diagram ( hrd ) toward the red giant branch ( see baraffe et al .",
    "1998 for details ) .",
    "as shown in  3 , determination of pl relationships is affected by the behavior of @xmath21 , since the reduction of the blue loop affects the width of the instability strip at short periods .",
    "indeed , the blue edge ( be ) is in this case determined by the turnover of the evolutionary track .",
    "note that determination of blue edges based on stability analysis of envelope models constructed for a given mass - luminosity relationship and obtained by varying arbitrarily @xmath25 would predict a hotter be for masses near @xmath21 . to illustrate this effect",
    ", we note that the fundamental be determined by the blue loop extension of the 3 @xmath2 star with @xmath0=0.004 is at @xmath26 k , corresponding to @xmath27 = 1.2 days and @xmath28 = 2.384 .",
    "however , for the same mass , luminosity and chemical composition , stability analysis performed on envelope models show that fundamental modes should be unstable up to @xmath25 = 6600 k and @xmath27 = 0.83 days .",
    "the extension of the blue loop depends not only on the metallicity but also on the helium abundance .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "2 which displays the evolutionary tracks of 4 @xmath2 stars with respectively @xmath17 ( solid curve ) , @xmath19 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath18 ( dotted curve ) . since the size of the blue loop increases when @xmath0 decreases for a given mass near @xmath21",
    ", we find @xmath21 = 3.75 @xmath2 for @xmath19 , instead of 3.875 @xmath2 for @xmath0=0.01 ( independently of @xmath16 ) .",
    "the final important effect of chemical composition to be mentioned in the present context concerns the mass - luminosity relationships . since for decreasing metallicity , the luminosity during core helium burning increases for a given mass",
    ", this effect has to be taken into account in order to correctly analyse the metallicity dependence of pl relationships .",
    "figure 3 shows the ml relationships based on the present standard calculations during the first crossing phase and during the blue loop from @xmath21 to 10 @xmath2 , the @xmath0=0.004 and @xmath0=0.01 models do not undergo a blue loop .",
    "the 12 @xmath2 star with @xmath0=0.02 does not undergo a blue loop and reaches a lower @xmath29 during core he burning than the 11 @xmath2 star with the same @xmath0 . ] . to estimate the following relationships , we have taken simple means of l in the instability strips ( of f , 1h and 2h modes )",
    "we stress above all that these relationships illustrate the metallicity effect ; more accurate values are given in the tables at the end of the present paper ( tables 6 - 8 ) . during the first crossing phase we find the following relationships :    = 3.21 + 0.51 z=0.02",
    "= 3.23 + 0.54 z=0.01 = 3.28 + 0.63 z=0.004    and in the blue loop is :    = 3.55 + 0.53 z=0.02 = 3.44 + 0.66 z=0.01 = 3.43 + 0.85 z=0.004    note that the mean luminosity of smc composition models is brighter than galactic composition models by @xmath30 0.2 .",
    "the initial helium abundance affects as well the ml relationship , and an increase of @xmath16 from 0.25 to 0.28 for the @xmath0=0.01 sequences yields an increase in log @xmath31 by @xmath32 .      the determination of pl relationships and the probability to detect a cepheid of a given mass in a large sample of data will heavily depend on the time spent in the instability strip .",
    "regarding the first crossing , this time is fixed by the thermal timescale of the star @xmath33 yrs .",
    "@xmath34 varies typically from @xmath35 yrs for 3 @xmath2 to @xmath36 yrs for 8 - 10 @xmath2 .",
    "the time spent in the instability strip during the first crossing is even shorter than @xmath34 and is roughly 100 times shorter than the time spent in the blue loop instability strip .    regarding this latter timescale , fig .",
    "4 displays evolutionary tracks of stars of different masses and indications of the time spent during the core he burning phase .",
    "the distribution of the evolutionary timescales in this figure is generic of core helium burning during a blue loop and remains valid independently of metallicity or convection treatment . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , most of the time during core he burning phase is spent near the turnover of the evolutionary tracks .",
    "the first branch of the blue loop is characterized by an increase in mass of the he convective core , the expansion of the regions inner to the h burning shell and the contraction of the envelope : evolution proceeds toward higher @xmath25 . as the central nuclear fuel ( he )",
    "is depleted , the central regions start to contract again , resulting in an expansion of the envelope , and the evolution proceeds toward lower @xmath25 on a shorter timescale determined by the faster depletion of he .",
    "interestingly enough , the mean position of a given mass in the is , taking into account its evolutionary time , is roughly located in the middle of the is .",
    "thus the time distribution in the is does not favor a particular position near the is edges , except for masses near @xmath21 for obvious reasons ( cf .",
    " 3.2 and fig .",
    "this result is valid for all metallicities studied and independently of the convective treatment .      in order to estimate the uncertainties of pl relationships relying on stellar evolution calculations",
    ", we have analysed the sensitivity of the results to a variation of the mixing length parameter @xmath7 and to the effect of overshooting or any enhanced mixing in the core .",
    "the effect of overshooting on stellar models and the necessity to include it or not in order to fit observations has been already widely investigated ( see bressan et al .",
    "1993 ; el eid 1994 ; pols et al . 1998 ; and references therein ) and is out the scope of the present paper .",
    "an increase of @xmath6 from our standard value 1.5 to 2 results essentially in the well - known shift of the red giant branch to higher @xmath25 .",
    "however , the ml relationships and the aspect of the blue loops remain essentially unchanged .",
    "we will see in  3 that this parameter affects the stability of the models and modifies the width of the is .",
    "the effect of enhanced mixing in the core as modeled by our simple recipe is more important regarding stellar evolution , and results in an increase of the luminosity for a given mass by 0.15 - 0.20 in @xmath37 for our adopted overshoot length @xmath38 .",
    "this is a little less than the mild - overshooting used by chiosi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) with an increase of the luminosity @xmath39 .",
    "the size of the blue loops are affected by overshooting and most importantly the minimum mass @xmath21 which undergoes a blue loop increases , in agreement with similar calculations including overshooting ( see el eid 1994 for a detailed discussion ) .    as discussed in baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the standard evolutionary models with @xmath0=0.01 do not predict the right position of the faintest cepheids observed in the eros-1 and eros-2 lmc samples , which show an abrupt end of the pl relationship for fundamental mode pulsators at a period @xmath40 = 2.5 days ( sasselov et al . 1997 ; bauer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this observational trend has been confirmed very recently by the macho survey ( alcock et al .",
    "although few objects are observed below this period , the bulk of fundamental mode cepheids clearly do not extend below this value .",
    "one may interpret this abrupt end in terms of the faintest unstable models on a blue loop , since most of the time is spent during this phase .",
    "the few objects below 2.5 days may then correspond to first crossing models and their scarcity is representative of the faster evolutionary timescale of this phase ( cf .",
    "our standard calculations for @xmath0=0.01 predict this abrupt end at @xmath41 1.8 days , corresponding to the blue loop unstable models of @xmath21 = 3.875 @xmath2 .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is a shortcoming in the stellar evolutionary models which may underestimate @xmath21 . with our overshooting prescription and an overshoot distance fixed at 0.15 @xmath8 the minimum mass @xmath21",
    "is shifted to 4.25 @xmath2 instead of 3.875 @xmath2 for @xmath0=0.01 . as shown in  4 ,",
    "this yields better agreement with the lower end of the pl relationship for lmc fundamental mode cepheids . when applying the same overshooting prescription to @xmath0=0.004 models ( _ i.e.",
    "_ , the smc metallicity ) , @xmath21 is shifted to 3.25 @xmath2 , instead of 3 @xmath2 in the standard case . however , for the smc , baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that the standard models are in excellent agreement with the observed distribution of fundamental mode cepheids , and overshooting is not required in this case ( cf .",
    "but the idea of invoking some kind of extra - mixing for lmc evolutionary models but not for the smc composition in order to improve the comparison with observed fundamental cepheids is not satisfactory .",
    "our poor understanding of core overshooting in the current stellar evolution theory does not allow any predictions or speculations regarding the efficiency of such mixing as a function of metallicity .",
    "we will come back to this problem in  4 .",
    "in order to get fully consistent calculations between evolutionary and pulsation calculations , a linear non - adiabatic stability analysis is performed directly on the complete evolutionary models along the tracks .",
    "this provides fully consistent mass - luminosity - period - evolutionary time relationships and enables us to analyse carefully evolutionary effects on the pl relationships .",
    "the pulsation calculations are performed with a radial pulsation code originally developed by umin lee ( lee 1985 ) .",
    "the main uncertainty inherent to the stability analysis concerns the pulsation - convection coupling , which is presently neglected , _",
    "i.e. _ , the perturbation @xmath42 of the convective flux is neglected in the linearized energy equation .",
    "such a crude approximation , adopted also in saio and gautschy ( 1998 ) , is resorted to our poor knowledge of the interaction between convection and pulsation , which requires a time - dependent non - local theory of convection .",
    "this interaction provides a damping term which is necessary to obtain a red edge for the cepheid is .",
    "perturbed models which assume @xmath43 = 0 ( cf .",
    "5 ) remain unstable even near the red giant branch ( cf . saio and gautschy 1998 , bono et al .",

    "1998 ) .",
    "several attempts have been made to take into account pulsation - convection coupling in cepheids with the most recent approach by yecko et al .",
    "( 1998 ; see also kollath et al .",
    "1998 ) and bccm98 . a systematic survey of linear properties of cepheid models including a model of turbulent convection performed by yecko et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows the extreme sensitivity of the instability strip location on the choice of the several free parameters inherent to the model of convection . as demonstrated by yecko et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the location and width of the is depend essentially on the three parameters which determine the mixing length , the convective flux and the eddy viscosity .",
    "the only possible method to calibrate these parameters is a comparison with observed is .",
    "however , one can expect that a theoretical determination of the is depends not only on pulsation calculations , but also on stellar evolution properties .",
    "since the purpose of the present paper is to determine to which extend evolutionary properties are important for the position and width of the is , we have chosen in a first study to limit the range of free parameters in the pulsation calculations , and to adopt a rather arbitrary criterion for the determination of the is red edge .",
    "a forthcoming paper will be devoted to the uncertainties resulting from the treatment of convection in the pulsation calculations .    in the present models , as shown in fig.5 , we assume ad hoc a red line corresponding to the effective temperature where the growth rate reaches a maximum as @xmath25 decreases along the evolutionary track for a given mass .",
    "this method is the same as adopted in chiosi et al .",
    "adopting a time dependence for the eigenfunctions of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the eigenfrequency of the @xmath46 mode , the growth rate is defined as @xmath47 .",
    "thus , positive growth rates indicate unstable modes .",
    "since most of the theoretical analysis devoted to cepheids are based on stability analysis of envelope models and ml relationships independent of metallicity , it is interesting to analyse the uncertainties resulting from such assumptions .",

    "the results of the linear stability analysis are shown in fig .",
    "6b . the differences between the is location based on the full calculations and envelope models are small when using the metallicity dependent ml relationships .",
    "the main differences are due to differences in the luminosity or to departure from the initial composition in the case of full calculations , as a consequence of the first dredge - up . as an example",
    ", we note that the red edge given by stability analysis of envelope models for 11 @xmath2 with @xmath0=0.02 ( full circles ) is slightly redder by @xmath48 100 k than the red edge given by the full calculations ( solid curves ) .",
    "this is mostly due to an enrichment of he in the envelope of this star from the initial value @xmath16=0.28 to @xmath16=0.31 . when adopting the latter value to construct the envelope models , the red edge is shifted to higher @xmath25 , in better agreement with realistic models .",
    "however , we note that such evolutionary effects affecting the initial composition are small and yield to a shift of the red edge of at most 100 k in @xmath25 .",
    "we also stress that this result highly depends on our rather uncertain criterion for the red edge determination .",
    "the most important effect is obtained when adopting for the @xmath0=0.02 models the same ml relationship as derived for @xmath0=0.004 ( eq .",

    ", we do not find significant metallicity effects on the location and width of the is .",
    "we only note that for @xmath49 , the red edge of the solar metallicity is moves toward slightly cooler @xmath25 . because of the arbitrariness of our red edge determination and the increasing influence of convection in such models , this result is to be taken with caution .",

    "7 , the mean position given by such weighting function for each stellar mass is roughly located in the middle of the is , and shows the negligible dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "such results do not support the conclusions of fernie ( 1990 ) who find a non uniform population of cepheids in the is .",
    "the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and such observations has been recently discussed by gautschy ( 1999 ) , and is confirmed by the present work .",
    "a more detailed analysis is under progress to determine whether the fernie ( 1990 ) results can be explained by an observational bias or by intrinsic properties of stellar models which escape to the present analysis .",
    "metallicity however affects the lower end of the period distribution since it modifies @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "as suggested in baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the reduction of the he blue loop yields a change of slope in the pl relationship . because of the metallicity dependence of @xmath21 , the period at which this change of slope is predicted decreases with metallicity . as illustrated in fig . 8 for standard models",
    ", this change of slope takes place at log @xmath41 0.2 for @xmath0=0.004 , log @xmath41 0.35 for @xmath0=0.01 and log @xmath41 0.5 for @xmath0=0.02 .",
    "although this value may change due to uncertainties in the convection treatment of the _ evolutionary models _ , as to be mentioned in the next section , the relative effect due to the metallicity is unaffected by such uncertainties .",
    "8 displays the unstable modes during the first crossing , which are expected to be observed in a sufficiently large sample of data .",
    "as already mentioned , the time spent during this phase is @xmath48 1/100 the time spent in the blue loop .",
    "thus in a large sample of data , one expects to see the trend of a change of slope followed by most of the low period cepheids , and a few of them with even lower periods which do not show a change of slope and belong to the first crossing .",
    "note that , although the time spent in the first crossing is relatively short , it remains too long to observe any variation of the period on a timescale of years . indeed , for a 4 @xmath2 with lmc composition",
    ", we predict a variation of @xmath27 during the first crossing of less than @xmath52 days per year .    finally , we derive pl relationships based on the following method : we assign a mean position to _ each _ stellar mass , according to the time spent in different locations in the is , and derive a _ linear _ least - square fit to these points from @xmath21 to 12 @xmath2 . in the following ,",
    "all relationships are based on this method , which is more convenient for an analysis of metallicity effects and a comparison with different sample of data over a wide range of periods , than the one adopted by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which gives higher weight to the lowest mass stars and favor the low period region .",
    "table 1 summarizes the coefficients of the present pl relationships as a function of metallicity and convection treatment .",
    "an inspection of table 1 shows a negligible dependence of the pl relationships on z. as expected from fig .",
    "8 , the pl relationships have much steeper slopes near @xmath21 : we obtain a slope of 1.36 from @xmath21 = 4.75 @xmath2 to 5.5 @xmath2 ( @xmath53 ) for @xmath0=0.02 , 1.46 from @xmath21 = 3.875 @xmath2 to 5 @xmath2 ( @xmath54 ) for @xmath0=0.01 and 1.47 from @xmath21 = 3 @xmath2 to 4 @xmath2 ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath0=0.004 . however , pl relationships derived from respectively 5.5 , 5 and 4 @xmath2 for @xmath0=0.02 , 0.01 and 0.004 , up to 12 @xmath2 , yield essentially the same results as obtained in table 1 .",

    "an increase of @xmath7 yields lower temperature gradients in the region of h and he partial ionization and results in a denser structure for a given @xmath59 .",

    "<S> we show that within the range of metallicity for the galaxy and the magellanic clouds , a change of slope in the period - luminosity ( pl ) relationship is predicted at low periods , due to the reduction of the blue loop during core he burning . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum mass undergoing a blue loop and consequently the critical period at which this change of slope occurs depend on the metallicity z and on the convection treatment in the stellar models .    </S>",
