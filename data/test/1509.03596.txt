    "loss of fidelity and decoherence are the twin obstacles to successful applications of quantum information devices .",
    "theoreticians like to consider the two separately , while in practical situations both will have destructive effects on quantum information flow . in this spirit",
    "it is important to propose a functional definition for the fidelity or better the fidelity amplitude of an open system . to achieve this",
    "we shall build on previous work .",
    "almost 20 years ago a measurement of the fidelity amplitude in a quantum system was proposed  @xcite , though the word itself was not mentioned .",
    "a more detailed presentation for a kicked rotor followed years later  @xcite , simultaneously with an extensive discussion of the theoretical framework  @xcite .",
    "the experiment for the kicked rotor was performed successfully in ref .",
    "the basic idea is that pure dephasing between a qubit and some system will cause the off diagonal elements or coherences of the density matrix of a pure superposition state of the qubit decay like the fidelity amplitude of the remaining system .",
    "our proposition is to follow exactly the same reasoning in the case where the remaining system is open , and thus interpret the decaying coherences as a generalized fidelity amplitude of the intermediate system .    for this purpose",
    "we have to consider a situation discussed in a previous paper  @xcite , where a central system coupled to two nested environments is analyzed to determine the effect of a far environment on the coherence of a central system not interacting directly with the far environment . the intermediate system or `` near environment '' would then be the open system we are analyzing using the qubit as a probe and as the source of the perturbation causing the fidelity decay in the absence of the far environment .",
    "our paper will thus fulfill a double purpose : on the one hand we shall introduce a generalized fidelity amplitude and study its behaviour in a `` quantum chaotic '' setting . on the other",
    "we shall deepen the understanding of the stabilizing effect on the central system of the coupling of the near environment to a far environment . note that in a previous paper  @xcite we introduced pure dephasing between the central system and the near environment , as a simplifying approximation to facilitate calculations , but for the present context this is an essential feature needed in order to establish the relation to fidelity decay of a closed system .    considering near and far environment as one closed system",
    ", the fidelity amplitude may be expressed as the expectation value of an echo operator  @xcite , which describes the forward and backward evolution of an initial state with somewhat different hamiltonians . in the present paper",
    "we shall derive a master equation which describes this echo dynamics reduced to the near environment alone .",
    "this master equation has the typical structure of master equations of kosakowski - sudarshan - lindblad form  @xcite ( henceforth referred to as lindblad equation ) and reduce to lindblad form when the coupling to the central system becomes zero .",
    "we then consider the random matrix model already used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that case , the master equation becomes very simple , and allows to obtain a closed integral equation for the generalized fidelity amplitude .",
    "we compare the solution of the integral equation with the generalized fidelity amplitude obtained from numerical simulations , and thereby show that the new integral equation applies for a very broad range of coupling strengths between near and far environment . while the random matrix model used here , is much simpler than the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , its effect on the fidelity amplitude is typically indistinguishable .    in the next section",
    "we shall fix notations and obtain the general master equation for describing the reduced echo dynamics in the near environment . at the end of this section , we derive the master equation for the random matrix model , which is largely equivalent to the model considered in  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ n ] we compare the generalized fidelity amplitude obtained from the new integral equation with numerical simulations , and in the last section we draw conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the model in general .",
    "the full system consists of three parts , the central system , the near environment and a far environment . in the following section ( sec .  [ mh ] )",
    "we start from a hamiltonian formulation , and perform partial traces in order to obtain the reduced dynamics either in the central system or in the near environment . assuming a dephasing coupling between central system and near environment",
    ", we can obtain the temporal evolution of the reduced density matrix in the central system , in terms of an asymmetric unitary evolution ( perturbed echo dynamics ) in the composite environment . in sec .",
    "[ mm ] we then use the standard born - markov approximation to trace out the far environment , and thereby arrive at a master equation for the reduced echo dynamics in the near environment alone .      for the coupling between central system and near environment , we assume that it is of the dephasing type , i.e. that it is given by a single product term , where the factor acting in the central system commutes with the hamiltonian describing the dynamics in the central system .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian for this part is given as @xmath0= 0 \\ ; .",

    "we will focus on only one such matrix element , and therefore suppress the indices @xmath8 from now on .",
    "we thus set @xmath9 which implies that @xmath10 .",
    "this shows that under dephasing coupling , the decoherence in the central system is given by the decay of the fidelity or lohschmidt echo in the near environment .",
    "turning the argument the other way around , this shows that it is possible to measure fidelity amplitudes , by coupling the system of interest ( i.e. the near environment ) to a probe system , which at the same time provides the perturbation .",
    "such experiments have been proposed and recently realized in different settings using atom interferometry  @xcite .    [ [ including - the - far - environment ] ] including the far environment + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now extend the model to include a far environment .",
    "we assume the far environment to be as simple as possible and that it allows to be taken into account implicitly in the form of a quantum master equation .",
    "hence , we write for the hamiltonian of the full tripartite system : @xmath11 where @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath13 and @xmath14 are normalized in such a way that @xmath15 gives the magnitude squared of a typical matrix element of the coupling term between near and far environment . with @xmath16 being the average level spacing ( i.e. the inverse level density ) in the spectrum of @xmath17",
    ", we see that @xmath18 is just @xmath19 times the corresponding fermi golden rule transition rate  @xcite . finally , @xmath18 itself is related to the decoherence rate for a superposition of @xmath19 states in the near environment . in the simplest case ( see sec .",
    "[ n ] ) , @xmath20 is precisely the decay rate of the purity in the intermediate system , in the case where the coupling to the central system is set to zero . within the hamiltonian model described by @xmath21 ,",
    "the coupling to the far environment requires the following modification to the expression for the fidelity amplitude given in eq .",

    "3.3 of ref .",
