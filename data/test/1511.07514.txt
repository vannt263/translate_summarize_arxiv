    "globular star clusters ( gcs ) are spectacular residents of our galaxy s halo and beyond , yet there are long standing mysteries as to how , when , and where they formed .",
    "these mysteries expanded with the recent discoveries of ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) , which began to bridge the classical gap between galaxies and star clusters and raised questions of how to differentiate between these two classes of stellar system . while studies of gcs in the milky way ( mw ) are focusing on remarkable clues about their origins from multiple stellar populations , another important window is to examine the extragalactic populations of gcs and ucds  to provide additional context , statistics , and opportunities for witnessing formation in action .    here",
    "we discuss briefly three areas of novel discovery and insight emerging recently from extragalactic studies .",
    "the first is new constraints on gc origins in a cosmological context (  [ sec : cosmo ] ) , the second is more extensive mapping of the parameter space of compact stellar systems (  [ sec : css ] ) , and the third concerns observations of tidally stripped nuclei (  [ sec : inform ] ) .",
    "gcs are thought to trace ancient phases of star and galaxy formation , but many of the particulars are murky .",
    "the mw provides important clues through the _ bimodality _ of its gc system , which consists of a roughly spherical , non - rotating , metal - poor `` halo '' component , and a flattened , rotating , metal - rich , `` bulge / thick - disk '' component .",
    "this configuration suggests a early , chaotic assembly through infalling dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* searle & zinn 1978 ) ) , followed by intense star - forming activity in the main part of the galaxy .",
    "a similar pattern is seen in other galaxies , including the giant ellipticals and lenticulars ( e / s0s ) , which commonly show color bimodality ( blue and red gcs ; e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zepf & ashman 1993 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* larsen et al .  2001 ) ) . despite some controversies about interpreting the colors , bimodality in metallicity",
    "has now been confirmed through spectroscopic efforts with keck / deimos as part of the sluggs survey ( brodie et al .",
    "2012 , 2014 ; usher et al .",
    "2012 ) , with supporting evidence from kinematics ( pota et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "adding to this picture is recent , deep _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging in the outer halo of a nearby s0 galaxy , which detected the elusive second peak of metal - poor red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars corresponding to the metal - poor gc peak ( figure  [ fig : bimod ] ; ( * ? ?",
    "* peacock et al .  2015 ) ) .",
    "this observation supports the view that blue gc subpopulations trace underlying metal - poor stellar halo populations and that gc bimodality implies two distinct , fundamental modes of early star formation .",
    "the different relative peak heights require a higher gc formation efficiency or survival rate in the metal - poor population , for reasons that remain undetermined ( see harris & harris 2002 ) .",
    "5060  kpc , and the gcs from subaru / suprime - cam photometry at comparable radii ( spectroscopic metallicities at smaller radii show similar results ) .",
    "the stellar histograms have been arbitrarily renormalized for comparison to the gcs .",
    "peaks are apparent in both tracers at [ @xmath3/h ] @xmath4 and @xmath5 , providing the first demonstration beyond the mw that gc bimodality is reflected in the underlying stellar halo .",
    ", width=432 ]    a clearer view of gc origins could be obtained through estimates of their ages , but even in the mw , the best current methods are still uncertain at the @xmath6  2  gyr level  which is the difference between forming at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this conundrum motivates an alternative approach where gc metallicities @xmath3 are used as a proxy for age , after recognizing that metals build up in galaxies like clockwork ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shapiro et al .  2010 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spitler 2010 ) ) .",
    "thus the gcs can be connected to the observed galaxy mass  metallicity  redshift relation in order to thereby infer both their epochs and their sites of formation .",
    "we have applied this `` metallicity matching '' method to gc spectroscopic data for a sample of e / s0s from sluggs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* forbes et al .  2015 ) ) .",
    "as figure  [ fig : metal ] shows , for each gc subpopulation , there is a range of possible average formation epochs : for example , the metal - poor gcs could have been formed very early in massive galaxies , or later in dwarf galaxies .",
    "this degeneracy is broken by invoking plausible growth curves for the gc host galaxies : one curve for the main progenitor galaxy , and one for a typical 1:10 mass - ratio accreted satellite .",
    "assuming that the metal - rich gcs are a predominantly in situ population , they appear to have formed in the range @xmath9  24 . if the metal - poor gcs are primarily accreted , then they formed at @xmath9  45 .     in high - mass galaxies , and metal - poor gcs at @xmath10 in dwarfs . , width=432 ]    this relatively recent birth date for the metal - poor gcs would make them a post - reionization population ",
    "an important conclusion since it has been proposed that reionization either produced a hiatus between the two gc subpopulations , or was caused by the gcs themselves ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* beasley et al .  2002 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* katz & ricotti 2013 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are significant caveats .",
    "one is that the galactic metallicity relation is not well constrained at redshifts above @xmath11 .",
    "another is that there may have also been an earlier , in situ phase of metal - poor gc formation in the main galaxy , which is reflected in some problems of crafting a self - consistent pure - accretion model ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spitler et al .  2012 ) ) ) .",
    "the inferred metal - rich gc birth date is more secure , and raises intriguing possibilities for further progress since the universe at @xmath0 is becoming well studied , as the `` high noon '' of cosmic star formation .",
    "we can now see directly where and how the intense bursts of star formation activity occurred that must have formed the bulk of the metal - rich gc populations .",
    "the answer is remarkable : rather than the gas - rich major mergers that dominated the thinking about gc and galaxy formation for many years , high-@xmath12 star formation is seen to concentrate in extended , turbulent , gas - rich galactic disks ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* genzel et al .  2008 ) ) .",
    "these disks host supergiant clumps of gas and young stars that seem natural spawning sites for gcs ( shapiro et al .  2012 ; kruijssen 2015 ) .",
    "this consolidation of observations at low and high redshifts motivates a new generation of theoretical models for the assembly of gc systems in a cosmological context .",
    "the models should include violent disk instabilities ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* porter et al .",
    "2014 ) ) , and should respect the full range of chemo - dynamical constraints : not only the numbers , ages , and metallicities of gcs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tonini 2013 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* li & gnedin 2014 ) ) , but also their spatial and orbital distributions  which have so far posed severe theoretical challenges ( see brodie et al",
    ".  2014 , section 5.4 , for more discussion ) .",
    "ucds were discovered serendipitously through spectroscopic surveys ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hilker et al .  1999 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* drinkwater et al .  2000 ) ) .",
    "they appear similar to gcs but typically have larger sizes ( half - light radii @xmath13  1040  pc rather than @xmath6  24  pc ) and higher luminosities ( up to @xmath14 ) .",
    "their formation mechanisms may include merging super star clusters and tidal stripping of galactic nuclei . however , their distributions in basic parameter space and in galactic environments are not clear .",
    "two major efforts to map out the properties of ucds more systematically include sluggs (  [ sec : cosmo ] ) and the archive of intermediate mass stellar systems project ( aimss ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* norris et al .  2014 ) ) .",
    "-band absolute magnitude for distance - confirmed hot stellar sytems .",
    "larger red circles mark objects discovered in the past 2 years .",
    "the black square and circle show ngc  2419 and @xmath2  cen , respectively . ]",
    "these surveys revealed that ucds are _ not _ synonymous with being very luminous : the family of large-@xmath15 objects also extends to lower luminosities and meets up with the `` faint fuzzies '' or extended clusters ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brodie et al .  2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* forbes et al .  2013 ) ) this expansion of classification boundaries means that the unusual mw object ngc  2419 is the nearest ucd . at the other end of the spectrum ,",
    "record - breaking dense stellar systems have been found ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* strader et al .  2013 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sandoval et al .  2015 ) ) , with these novel extremes of high- and low - surface brightness demonstrating the pivotal role of selection effects in shaping our conceptions of stellar systems .",
    "an additional uncharted area of parameter space is the gap between ucds and compact ellipticals , which is now seen to be filled in with ce  ucd transition objects ( see size ",
    "luminosity diagram in figure  [ fig : size ] ) .",
    "this steadily growing menagerie of diverse compact stellar systems compounds the need to decipher their interrelations and origins .",
    "the ucds probably include more than one underlying subpopulation , and recent cosmological models conclude that most of them are unusually large star clusters , with only a minority being stripped nuclei ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pfeffer et al .  2014 ) ) .",
    "tests of these claims are needed from in - depth observational studies of the ucds .",
    "some cases of stripped nuclei are obvious , based on an overmassive central black hole , or on an extended star formation history ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* seth et al .  2014 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* norris et al .  2015 ) ) .",
    "metallicity is another useful diagnostic , as ces and the highest - mass ucds were found to be relatively metal - rich , in a probable reflection of stripped nuclei origins ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* janz et al .  2016 ) ) .",

    "* strader et al .  2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "a central compact stellar cluster is visible , with properties similar to @xmath2  cen . ]    besides the clues to the past of ucds , it is also possible to witness ongoing ucd formation by tidal stripping .",
    "the nearby `` hamburger '' spiral galaxy ngc  3628 boasts a tidal stream that appears to contain the nucleus of the disrupting dwarf galaxy ( figure  [ fig : n3628 ] ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jennings et al .  2015 ) ) .",

    "other , similar examples have also been found recently ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
