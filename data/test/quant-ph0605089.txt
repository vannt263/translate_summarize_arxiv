    "it has long been recognized that when an atom is situated in a material medium , the local electromagnetic field acting on it differs from the macroscopic one due to the gaps between the atom and the surrounding medium atoms , which are ignored on a coarse - grained macroscopic scale @xcite .",
    "accounting for the difference between the two fields hence requires a correction  the local - field correction .",
    "classical calculations of local - field effects , which typically have their origin in near dipole - dipole interactions , can be found in textbooks ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in quantum theory , investigations of local - field effects",
    "are often related to the problem of the spontaneous decay of an excited guest atom embedded in a ( dielectric ) host .",
    "local - field effects in spontaneous decay have been studied , e.g. , for crystals @xcite and disordered dielectrics @xcite on the basis on microscopic models for coupled atomic dipoles .    in macroscopic descriptions , local - field effects",
    "are frequently taken into account by regarding the guest atom as being enclosed in a virtual @xcite or real ( spherical ) cavity @xcite surrounded by the medium , with the cavity size being small compared to the relevant transition wavelength .",
    "the cavity in the former model is virtual in the sense that it does not perturb the macroscopic field .",
    "it is filled by the atoms comprising the medium , which produce no net effect at the central position in important special cases such as cubic or random structures . in the latter model ,",
    "the field is modified by the presence of the cavity , which is an empty region containing only the guest atom .",
    "microscopic models often tend to agree with the virtual - cavity results @xcite , while many recent experiments on spontaneous emission in dielectrics support the real - cavity model @xcite .",
    "it has been presumed that while the virtual - cavity model applies to interstitial atoms , the real - cavity model is specific to substitutional atoms , and that the case of substitutional atoms occurs prevalently for impurity atoms in disordered dielectrics  @xcite .    since in the approaches to the local - field effects",
    ", the host medium has typically been assumed to be a bulk medium that extends homogeneously to infinity , the question of the effect of the size and shape of the host medium on the local field has arisen . in a macroscopic approach",
    ", the spontaneous - decay rate of an excited atom in some free - space region can be given in terms of the imaginary part of the green tensor of the macroscopic maxwell equations , which characterizes the ( macroscopic ) environment of the atom .",
    "this relation in principle allows for including local - field corrections for atoms embedded in arbitrary material configurations by assuming a real ( spherical ) cavity surrounding the atom and calculating the corresponding green tensor . using the real - cavity model ,",
    "toma @xcite studied the local - field correction to the spontaneous - decay rate of an excited atom , which is located at the center of a dispersing and absorbing dielectric sphere .",
    "reformulating the result by representing it in a form , which does not explicitly refer to the highly symmetric system considered , he made the conjecture that it may also remain valid beyond the specific example and hence also apply to other locations of the atom and other shapes of the host body .    based on a numerical computation of the respective green tensors , rahmani and",
    "bryant @xcite considered the case of an atom at an arbitrary location within a dielectric sphere or a dielectric cube . comparing their results for the dielectric sphere including the local - field correction with earlier results disregarding the local - field correction @xcite , they suggested a rate formula , which in the case of weakly absorbing material corresponds to toma s formula .",
    "however , since their approach relies heavily on numerical calculations , it can not produce explicit expressions for the quantities that are related to the local - field correction .",
    "the exact analytical evaluations of the green tensors of realistic systems which have finite sizes and include a cavity can be very cumbersome . in this paper , we present an attempt to overcome this difficulty by writing the green tensor as a born series in terms of the susceptibility , where in many situations one can restrict oneself to several leading - order terms .",
    "in particular , we show that to linear order the spontaneous - decay rate of a guest atom in a dielectric host body can be separated into a term representing the local - field correction to the decay rate in free space and a term related to the scattering green tensor of the body without the atom  a result which exactly corresponds to toma s conjecture mentioned above .",
    "furthermore , we show that for atoms which are situated at the interior of a macroscopic body toma s conjecture remains valid beyond the linear order .",
    "we illustrate the theory by discussing in detail the case of an atom embedded in a spherical dielectric body .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "@xmath22 @xmath23 , this limit exists , @xmath24 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , leading to @xmath25 secondly , the green tensor of the macroscopic maxwell equations does not account for the fact that the local field felt by the atom is different from the macroscopic one in general .",
    "that is , even if absorption is neglected , the rate formula ( [ eq.10 ] ) is not complete because it lacks the local - field corrections .      to calculate the ( scattering part of the ) green tensor for an arbitrary arrangement of dielectric bodies , it may be helpful to use an appropriate born expansion .",
