    "interesting wave patterns often form on growing icicles that are covered with a thin layer of flowing water ( see fig.1)@xcite . for many of these patterns ,",
    "the wavelength has a gaussian distribution centered at approximately 8 mm ; however , despite their common occurrence , there is no quantitative explanation for this wavelength distribution @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these waves are associated with the growth of the icicles and the flow of fluid along the icicle .",
    "hence , there are several processes occurring that should be considered .",
    "these include crystallization from the melt , latent heating at the ice - melt interface , laminar flow with two interfaces ( ice - melt and melt - air ) , evaporation of liquid , and transport of heat through the surrounding air .",
    "that the waves tend to encircle the icicle clearly indicates the importance of gravity - induced flow , although the specific interactions between the flow , the ice growth , and the heat flow through both interfaces must be considered .        in the study of crystal growth ,",
    "such a surface instability is usually explained by mullins - sekerka theory ( hereafter abbreviated as ms ) .",
    "ms theory is based on two observations : laplace instability and gibbs - thomson effect .",
    "( for detailed explanation , refer to text books and original paper by mullins and sekerka cited in @xcite . )    to a good approximation , the ice in the icicle has a uniform temperature of 273 k , thus temperature gradients into the ice are insignificant , and the external temperature field is time independent and satisfies laplace s equation .",
    "we further assume that the external temperature is below 273 k ; i.e. , the ice is not melting on average . at a convex point ,",
    "the temperature gradient is higher .",
    "because heat flow is proportional to the gradient of temperature , the larger heat flow at a convex point rapidly removes latent heat from the ice surface thus allowing the convex points to increase in size rapidly .",
    "conversely , concave regions grow relatively slowly .",
    "this phenomenon suggests that short - wavelength fluctuations increase in amplitudes more rapidly than long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "we refer to this as the laplace instability .",
    "next we explain the gibbs - thomson effect .",
    "the surface of a solid object has its own energy per area called surface free energy . if a molecule attaches itself to the surface near a convex point , the surface area increases , resulting in an increase in energy . on the other hand , if a molecule becomes attached to the surface near a concave point , absorption of the molecule",
    "makes the surface area smaller .",
    "therefore , absorption of molecule at a concave point is more energy - efficient than is absorption at a convex point .",
    "for this reason , the melting point depends on the curvature of an object , i.e. , the shape of the surface area .",
    "the melting point is lower at a convex surface ( easy to melt ) and is higher at a concave surface ( hard to melt ) .",
    "such an effect suppresses the fluctuation and makes surface flat .",
    "this is called gibbs - thomson effect , which is opposite to that of laplace instability .",
    "laplace instability enhances shorter wavelength fluctuation , and gibbs - thomson effect suppresses shorter wavelength fluctuation . from these two effects",
    ", we have fluctuation of specific wavelength mainly .",
    "these two effects are incorporated in mullins - sekerka s theory @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , the simple application of this theory can not take place in the case of icicles .",
    "the reasons are as follows . :",
    "firstly , the water layers on icicles are too thin to produce a laplace instability . because the instability requires that the water thickness be larger than the wavelength of the fluctuation .",
    "secondly , the curvature is too small .",
    "( wavelength 1 cm is much larger than 10 @xmath0 which gt effect requires to be effective . )",
    "therefore the nature of wave patterns along icicles can not be explained by naive ms theory .",
    "+ we neglect the fluid instabilities that require turbulence because there should be no turbulence in these water films @xcite .",
    "this is because the layers are only about 100 @xmath0 thick and the flow speeds are about 2 - 4cm / s ; the resulting reynolds numbers are only about 1 and the flow is laminar . the hydrodynamics in thin water layer is also discussed by wettlaufer et.al to explain the premelting dynamics , but the discussion here is essentially different @xcite .    for our analysis , we assume water flow on a ramp ( see fig.2 ) because it is simpler to treat and relevant experiments for this geometry are available @xcite .",
    "much of the same processes and relative length scales occur in both system because the water - layer thickness ( @xmath1 ) is much smaller than the radius of icicle ( @xmath2 ) . furthermore , matsuda @xcite , observed wave patterns on such an ice ramp ; for example , at @xmath3 , the wavelength was about 8 mm .",
    "degrees.,width=226 ]    liquid flow of a thin water on a flat ramp(benney s liquid film ) produces waves @xcite(see also @xcite ) ; however , these waves travel down the ramp and thus are unlike the case on icicles . due to the explicit calculation , the wavelength of these travelling surface waves is about 1 cm , which agrees with wavelength along icicles , but they move at about 4 - 8 cm / s which is twice the speed of the fluid .",
    "benney s wave is caused by gravity and surface tension , but it is unclear how it applies to the standing waves on ice unless the travelling waves can become pinned to a fixed location ; such a pinning mechanism has not yet been proposed .",
    "our approach is to assume static flow with small ripples on the ramp surface , and then calculate the growth rate for the ripples by solving the thermal diffusion equation in the background fluid . in section 2 , we discuss the fluid dynamics of a thin water flowing along a ramp , and then in section 3 , we couple the thermal diffusion process to the flow .",
    "the thermal diffusion in air is solved in section 4 , and in section 5 we discuss the growth rate of fluctuation on icicles by combining the solutions for thermal diffusion equations in two regions ; air and water .",
    "we consider the fluid mechanics of a thin water layer with depth @xmath4 as sketched in fig.3 . over each wavelength , the average depth is @xmath5 .",
    "there are two material boundaries , one is the solid - liquid boundary sl , and the other is the air - liquid boundary al .",
    "the x - axis is along the ramp and increases in the downhill direction , whereas y- is the outward normal to the ramp .",
    "the sl surface is not flat and given by    @xmath6    al surface is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 means average over wavelength in x - direction .        in the experimental data @xcite ,",
    "surface velocity of fluid is about 3cm / s , and by using nusselt equation which is shown later @xcite , the average water - layer thickness @xmath5 was around @xmath9 mm .",
    "the wavelength @xmath10 is about 1 cm experimentally .",
    "we use the parameter @xmath11 which is @xmath12 for the typical experimental values above . in general",
    ", having @xmath13 defines the long - wavelength approximation .",
    "our key assumptions are as follows .",
    "* steady - state(time - independent ) flow .",
    "* @xmath14 ( long wavelength approximation ) * incompressible fluid .",
    "we prefer to use the following dimension - less variables . for length ,",
    "@xmath15 the thickness of water layer is thus @xmath16 and the height of the sl and al surfaces are    @xmath17    the characteristic flow velocity in the x - direction is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the gravitational acceleration and the viscosity @xmath20 at 0 degrees centigrade .",
    "this is a nusselt equation , the theoretically predicted velocity at al surface when @xmath21 , i.e. , for a flat sl surface with uniform thickness @xcite .",
    "this unperturbative solution results by equating the gravitational force to the viscous force .",
    "the velocity distribution is parabolic in y ; @xmath22 we consider perturbations of this solution . by using the above formula for the speed",
    ", we relate the experimentally - determined flow @xmath23 to @xmath5 and , surface velocity @xmath24 .",
    "the flow quantity is defined by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , the mean speed ; r , the radius of icicle . in the experiment @xcite , matsuda used the flow @xmath27 and width of gutter @xmath28 ( @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath30 ) because this produced the clearest waves .",
    "this gives @xmath31 . from @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( by setting @xmath3 ) , we get @xmath34 with @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "his measurement of the surface mean velocity by observing the motion of fine grain was @xmath36 at @xmath3 .",
    "hence , we assume @xmath37 with @xmath38 as the experimental surface speed and water - layer thickness .    in the y - direction ,",
    "characteristic velocity is @xmath39 we write @xmath40 as speed in the x - direction , @xmath41 as that in the y - direction , and @xmath42 as the pressure .",
    "dimensionless speeds and pressure are given by @xmath43 other dimensionless constant parameters are , respectively , the reynolds number and the weber number @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the surface tension of liquid water .",
    "approximate values of these quantities , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 predict @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this value of reynolds number indicates laminar flow .",
    "the flow components u and v satisfy the steady - state navier stokes equation for incompressible fluids : @xmath51    the incompressibility condition is @xmath52 mass conservation law at the water - air interface requires @xmath53 the boundary conditions at the sl surface are zero fluid velocity : @xmath54    stress balancing condition on al surface ; that is , free surface condition is @xmath55 the index means @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the normal unit vector to the al surface .",

    "the form of stream function is intuitively understood easily . because it is just the modification of unperturbative solution for the velocity to be vanished at non flat sl boundary .",

    "hereafter we work with finite @xmath129 case , because the ramp case is always retained by taking the limit as above .",
    "the reader might think the appearance of logarithmic term strange , since it diverges at large @xmath137 .",
    "but the appearance of such a term is natural for infinitely long axially symmetric source .",
    "as real icicles have finite length , this solution is valid only close to the icicle ; far from the icicle , the icicle acts like a point source of heat and we must mach the near - icicle and far - icicle solutions at @xmath138 where l is the length of the icicle .",
    "this matching includes the temperature at infinity and partly determines the coefficients a , b and c ; in addition , the mean growth rate of the icicle radius also determine coefficient b , which includes the information of the temperature at infinity .",

    "theory , @xmath166 for the surface @xmath167 .",
    "but now we have another term @xmath168 . to understand its physical meaning , we write the relative growth rate @xmath169 as the growth rate in a reference frame moving with velocity @xmath144 ( @xmath170 ) . @xmath171",
    "the steady - state condition means , @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the hight of sl surface in reference frame . from the steady - state condition ,",
    "the time scale for growth of fluctuation is very long compared to our observing time scale . by solving the equation : @xmath174 we obtain @xmath175 with relations @xmath176 the essential point is that the fluctuation is not only growing up , but also traveling downwards ( @xmath177 ) .    therefore the amplification factor is determined from f. by using the relation @xmath178 , we have @xmath179 note that @xmath180 . in the case of @xmath181 , meaning a thick icicle , we obtain @xmath182    because @xmath183 , this form is similar to the amplification factor given by mullins - sekerka theory .",
    "the amplification factor increases proportional to wave number by thermal diffusion in air as expected for a laplace instability , and it decays by interaction with fluid @xmath184 .",
    "the thermal diffusion in thin water flow works just like gibbs - thomson effect , since the fluid changes temperature distribution to be uniform and inhibit laplace instability . from these two effects",
    ", we have maximum value for @xmath185 .     versus the dimensionless wave number @xmath114 .",
    "laplace instability in air and",
    "a gt like effect due to hydrodynamics amplifies perturbations that have a wavelength given by an @xmath114 close to 2.2.,width=188 ]    the maximum amplification factor occurs when @xmath186 , which determines a preferred wavelength . @xmath187 by using @xmath188 with experimental data : @xmath189 we have @xmath190 which well agrees with experimental value of 8 mm .",
    "@xcite also , in agreement with observations , this value does not directly depend on external temperature .    using the constraints between @xmath24 , @xmath5 , and flow quantity @xmath23 as , @xmath191    then @xmath23 is related to @xmath192 as @xmath193 where @xmath3 is assumed .",

    "actually the speed @xmath203 when @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "then we can imagine that such speed will be increasing function of fluid velocity @xmath24 .",
    "but this is not true . for ( solid ) surface fluctuation to change its form ,",

    "the amplification ( growing ) factor becomes maximum at the specific value of @xmath114 , the traveling speed may have such dependence of @xmath114 .",
    "qualitatively this is due to the fact that fluid not only to carry heat downwards ( small @xmath114 region in fig.5 ) , but also make the temperature field uniform and thus suppresses the heat diffusion ( large @xmath114 region in fig.5 ) .",
    "we have shown that an icicle covered with thin water flow makes wave - like undulations on the ice during solidification , and the preferred wavelength is determined by a ms - like theory .",
    "thermal diffusion in air makes wavelength shorter , i.e. the amplification factor becomes larger for shorter wavelengths . on the other hand , thermal diffusion in thin water flow makes the wavelength larger , i.e. the amplification factor becomes smaller for shorter wavelengths .",
    "from these two effects , a specific wavelength emerges with a maximum amplification factor of fluctuation .",
    "the thermal diffusion in the thin water flow works just like the gibbs - thomson effect because the water flow makes the temperature distribution more uniform and thus inhibits the laplace instability .",

    "although the mean growth rate @xmath144 and also the amplification factor increase with a decrease of temperature , the selected wavelength with the maximum amplification factor is independent of icicle growth rate ( [ af ] ) .    we have also shown that surface ripples are expected to travel downwards during icicle growth with a speed of 0.5 times the average normal growth rate of the ice .",
    "this should be checked by experiment .",
    "our theory may be used to map the waves around mineral stalagmite by changing the diffusion equation from temperature field to a solute density field .",
