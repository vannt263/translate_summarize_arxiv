    "the crystal when cut along the ( 0001 ) or ( 000@xmath5 ) planes is known to be a type iii polar material according to the tasker classification .",
    "@xcite that is to say that the unit cell is comprised of alternative negative and positive charged layers .",
    "this ultimately leads to a diverging electrostatic potential and should make the two polar surfaces of zno energetically unfavourable .",
    "this , however , is not the case as both the o - terminated and zn - terminated polar surfaces show remarkable stability.@xcite    consider a slab of the material with bulk - terminated polar surface as used in typical computations ( see figure 1 ) . since the polar zno(0001 ) and zno(00@xmath6 ) surfaces occur naturally , there must be a mechanism to quench the dipole moment that exists normal to the slab surface . in order to quench this macroscopic dipole moment a transfer of charge across the slab of @xmath7",
    "is necessary , where @xmath8 is the surface charge density.@xcite this may be understood in terms of the electrostatic energy change when charge is moved from one surface to the other in the direction of the internal electric field of the unreconstructed slab .",
    "once sufficient charge has been moved , the counter electric field thus established cancels the one due to the bulk structure .",
    "there are several mechanisms which may compensate the charge at the surface and counteract the macroscopic dipole moment of the semi - infinite crystal .",
    "three , not necessarily incompatible , mechanisms have been considered in the literature : ( _ i _ ) adsorption of charged species e.g. hydroxilation , ( _ ii _ ) modification of the surface region by reconstruction , and ( _ iii _ ) direct charge transfer .    until recently , the exact nature of such a mechanism in zno was not well understood , but recent theoretical and experimental studies@xcite may have resolved the issue .",
    "a combination of surface microscopy techniques and density functional theory ( dft ) have indicated that , depending on the atmospheric environment , mechanisms ( i ) and ( ii ) may be active in quenching the polarisation of the zno(0001 ) surfaces . for the zn terminated orientation and in hydrogen - rich conditions , the surface is best passivated by adsorption of hydroxyl groups , while under low hydrogen partial pressure the surface tends to form triangular reconstructions that appropriately compensate the charge imbalance created by the surface cut .",
    "this work seems to rule out the third mechanism ( iii ) which had previously been proposed,@xciteinvolving charge transfer between o - terminated and zn - terminated surfaces .",
    "the above theoretical studies have relied on dft which , while accurate , has a high computational cost and does not allow for a comprehensive search of the phase space .",
    "for example , in the case of the triangular reconstruction , stm scans show a range of triangle sizes while dft studies only allow comparison of the energetics of single , relatively small configurations . in this work we present a study which combines fast , albeit less accurate , empirical potentials with monte - carlo simulations to study the structure and energetics of the polar zno(0001 ) surface , focusing on the surface reconstruction mechanism to quench the dipole .",
    "this approach is justified by the dominant role electrostatics plays in the surface resconstructions.@xcite    the rest of the paper has the following structure .",

    "[ fig:02-initial - triangle ] is not the most stable in this work , contrary to the prediction from density functional theory .",

    "it is only the _ difference _ in surface energies of various reconstructions that is of interest .",
    "the most stable reconstruction is the small @xmath30 cluster with the smallest triangular vacancy ( see figure [ fig:02-initial - triangle ] ) , with the more exotic reconstruction on the @xmath28 surface cell lying nearby .",

    "in conclusion , the surface hierarchy obtained using the simple empirical potential shows no preference for large triangular reconstructions .",
    "instead , small clusters which locally quench the surface dipole are preferred .",
    "the small impact of surface relaxation reflects the dominance of dipole moment quenching .",
    "this means that surface relaxation can be neglected in the mc simulations which follow , in which we allow the system to explore configuration space to see if larger reconstructions emerge naturally in our model with formal ionic charges .",
    "we have performed the mc simulation of a high temperature quench on a slab with @xmath31 and with the surfaces initially tessellated with the @xmath30 triangular reconstructions giving @xmath32 ions in total .",
    "representative snapshots of the species distribution in the three uppermost layers of the zn - terminated surface are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:04-snapshot - of - three bilayers](_a - c _ ) .",
    "we show the three uppermost bilayers separately ( bilayer 1 - 3 ) at _ ( a ) _ the start of the simulation , _ ( b ) _ at the end of the high temperature run , and _ ( c ) _ after quenching .",
    "the figure clearly shows the effect of the high temperature , with the ordered triangular reconstructions completely disappearing from the first bilayer .",
    "the second and third bilayers are occupied as well , with no apparent ordering . after the system is cooled and left to evolve , large triangular reconstructions in the lowest bilayer begin to nucleate via aggregation of small triangular units .",
    "the smallest such unit is the one unit - cell triangle ( three o ions surrounding one zn ion ) and is consistent with the earlier empirical potential result .",
    "the second bilayer only shows a few isolated @xmath33side triangles , while the third layer is now completely empty .",
    "these observations are qualitatively identical for a large class of system size and parameters .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the evolution of the surface energy and the dipole moment normal to the surface in the simulation . during the high temperature anneal ,",
    "both the surface energy and dipole moment are large in magnitude .",
    "this is due to the almost random placement of the surface layer ions into the 3 accessible bilayers , which leads to an obvious loss of bonding energy .",
    "the dipole moment also increases in magnitude since there is an excess of oxygen ions over zinc in the surface , so displacing them on average by one bilayer changes the total moment in the system . upon quenching ,",
    "the surface energy and dipole moment quickly reduce in magnitude , and in fact reach slightly lower values than in the starting configuration . at the start of the simulation ,",
    "the dipole moment is @xmath34 e@xmath35 , and is not zero since @xmath36 rather than the ideal @xmath27 .",
    "after the temperature is raised , the dipole moment is roughly @xmath37 e@xmath35 , since the topmost ions are now randomly distributed . by the end of the quench , after @xmath38 ,",
    "its value is slightly lower , @xmath39 e@xmath35 .",
    "this is achieved by the few ions occupying the second bilayer . for the surface energy ,",

    "the simulation is started from a @xmath30 tiled surface with a small residual surface dipole .",
    "we proceed to run the simulation at high temperature ( @xmath42 ) for a large enough number of steps , then ( a ) quench to a lower temperature ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the surface energy and dipole moment both settle at a lower value than initially .",
    "( b ) successive deposition of zn / o pairs are then executed , up to 1 ml , then ( c ) 2 ml , allowing for a large enough number of steps between events to reach a new steady - state ( d).[fig:05-surface - energy_dipole],width=302 ]    the quenched mc simulation clearly shows that the system can evolve to a structure with preferred triangular motif and no regular tessellation of the surface .",
    "it is of interest to see if this effect also emerges during a simulation where the total number of ions in the surface layers increases over time , mimicking epitaxial growth .",
    "starting from the end of a quenched simulation , we perform the mc annealling but now add pairs of zn@xmath44/o@xmath45 ions at separate , randomly chosen sites in the three uppermost layers of the slab .",
    "results from a simulation performed on a @xmath29 , @xmath46 slab ( @xmath47 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:06-deposition snapshots ] .",
    "again , the simulation shows that triangular reconstructions form spontaneously , and grow larger by nucleation from characteristic smaller aggregates .",
    "we also see that the growth on the 2nd bilayer proceeds before the 1st bilayer is complete , leading to a surface with multiple ad - islands and pits of various size .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:05-surface - energy_dipole ] we also show how the surface energy and dipole moment change during the deposition simulation .",
    "the addition of the ions allows the system to find structures with decreasing magnitude of dipole moment , since thereby lowering the electrostatic energy .",
    "an interesting feature shown by fig .",
    "[ fig:05-surface - energy_dipole ] is that both surface energy and dipole moment oscillate as more ions are added , and reach even lower values as we deposit more and more ions .",
    "thus the system finds a steady state with lower energy and dipole moment by making use of the larger number of degrees of freedom made available by the deposited ions .",
    "it is observed from the stm results @xcite that not one but several triangular features co - exist at the surface of zn - terminated zno(0001 ) .",
    "this behaviour also emerges in our monte - carlo simulations , for both the quenched structure in fig .",
    "[ fig:04-snapshot - of - three bilayers ] and the deposition structure in fig .",
    "[ fig:06-deposition snapshots ] .",
    "the reason for this can be traced to the small energy differences between the various surface reconstructions shown in table [ tab : surface - energy ] ; there is no substantially preferred reconstruction , provided @xmath48 is close to 0.235 locally .",
    "therefore the patterns that emerge in the mc simulations result from the competitive growth of energetically comparable triangular reconstructions . for this reason",
    ", we do not observe any long time coarsening of the structures in the simulation , as can be seen from the surface energy evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:05-surface - energy_dipole ] during the quenched phase before deposition starts , and neither do we observe the system being restored to its regular tessellated starting configuration .    our quenched mc simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig:04-snapshot - of - three bilayers ] produces an interesting surface morphology that is reminiscent of the experimental stm images @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the simulation with increasing surface coverage of fig .",
    "[ fig:06-deposition snapshots ] also includes other morphological features such as co - existing ad - islands and pits that are found experimentally .",
    "therefore , we believe that the simulations capture some of the main physical processes that give rise to these surface reconstructions . however , it is important to note that the reconstructions found by the simulation are much smaller than those observed experimentally .",
    "the largest triangle observed from the mc simulation has a side of the order of 20thus only reproducing the smallest clusters observed in the stm scans .",
    "it is possible that this is due to the lattice sizes and simulation durations that are accessible .",
    "another explanation is that our use of formal charges ( @xmath17 ) on the ions is not justified in this system .",
    "using formal charges probably overestimates the strength of the coulomb interaction , thereby tending to make the triangular clusters at the surface more compact .",
    "work to augment the current model using a charge equilibration ( or qeq ) scheme @xcite is therefore planned .    in conclusion , we believe that the models presented here do help to explain the zn - terminated surface reconstructions observed experimentally . whilst the accuracy of our models can not compete with dft , we are not restricted to studying individual reconstructions .",
    "the use of empirical potentials allows us to explore the phenomenology of the surface reconstructions more freely , and we find that a broad range of characteristic triangular motifs naturally emerge in our simulations , qualitatively consistent with the stm results ."
