    "in fact the technique works for individual galaxies in principle .",
    "unfortunately with realistic noise estimates , the tradeoff between model independence and sensitivity is severe .",
    "for example , a 10% change in the equation of state parameter @xmath115 typically yields an @xmath116 change in the efficiency ratio and so measurement of the effect is only possible with large galaxy and shear surveys .",

    "the sample variance arises from contributions to the shear from structure along the line of sight not associated with the galaxy population and from the intrinsic clustering of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , with finite - width redshift bins in the lens galaxy distributions , the efficiency ratios depend on the model for the evolution of the underlying power spectra across the bins @xcite .",
    "even with our 5 halo parameter model for the evolution in each bin , the constraints are compromised .",
    "no constraints are possible with photometric redshift bins of @xmath117 if we marginalize all 5 parameters for a given bandpower in @xmath74 . by combining multiple bandpowers",

    ", we instead marginalize a _ single _ halo parameter per redshift and bandpower bin .",
    "this model is equivalent to marginalizing a constant amplitude or bias per bandpower in the underlying power spectrum .",
    "hence it eliminates information from the shape but retains an assumption on the evolution of the galaxy - mass power spectrum .",
    "results do not depend on the number of bands employed so long as the signal and noise dominated regimes are separated since the additional parameters are employed simply to remove shape information from measurements of different bands .",

    "we can also assess the effect of sample variance by artificially removing the terms in the covariance ( [ eqn : crosscov ] ) that are proportional to @xmath124 .",
