    "now that cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) experiments @xcite have verified the inflationary predictions of a flat universe and structure formation from primordial adiabatic perturbations , we are compelled to test further the predictions of the simplest single - scalar - field slow - roll inflation models and to look for possible deviations .",
    "measurements of the distribution of primordial density perturbation afford such tests .",
    "if the primordial perturbations are due entirely to quantum fluctuations in the scalar field responsible for inflation ( the `` inflaton '' ) , then their distribution should be _ very _ close to gaussian ( e.g. , ) . however , multiple - scalar - field models of inflation allow for the possibility that a small fraction of primordial perturbations are produced by quantum fluctuations in a second scalar field .",
    "if so , the distribution of these perturbations could be non - gaussian ( e.g. , ) .",
    "moreover , it is still possible that some component of primordial perturbations are due to topological defects or some other exotic causal mechanism @xcite , and if so , their distribution should be non - gaussian ( e.g. , ) .",
    "detection of any non - gaussianity would thus be invaluable for appreciating the nature of the ultra - high - energy physics that gave rise to primordial perturbations . ruling such exotic possibilities in or out",
    "will also be necessary to test the assumptions that underly the new era of precision cosmology .",
    "there are several observables that can be used to look for primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "cmb maps probe cosmological fluctuations when they were closest to their primordial form , and many authors have developed various mathematical tools to test the gaussian hypothesis .",
    "the statistics of present - day large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe can also be used ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the properties and abundances of the most massive and/or highest - redshift objects in the universe also contain precious information about the nature of the initial conditions ( e.g. , ; robinson , gawiser & silk 1999 ; robinson , gawiser & silk 2000 ; ( mvj ) ; ) . in verde",
    "et al . ( 2000a ; vwhk00 ) , the relative sensitivities of the cmb and lss to several broad classes of primordial non - gaussianity were compared , and it was found that forthcoming cmb maps can provide more sensitive probes of primordial non - gaussianity than galaxy surveys . here",
    "we extend the results of that paper to include comparisons to the abundances of high - redshift galaxies as well as the abundance and properties of clusters .",
    "one of our original aims was to determine whether any of these probes would be able to detect the miniscule deviations from gaussianity that arise from quantum fluctuations in the inflaton ; unfortunately , we have been unable to find any .",
    "nevertheless , some detectable deviations from gaussianity are conceivable with multiple - field models of inflation and/or some secondary contribution to primordial perturbations from topological defects .",
    "we will follow vwhk00 and parameterize the primordial non - gaussianity with a parameter that can be dialed from zero ( corresponding to the gaussian case ) for two different classes of non - gaussianity .",
    "we will then compare the smallest value for the parameter that can be detected with each of the different approaches .",
    "there are infinite types of possible deviations from gaussianity , and it is unthinkable to address them all",
    ". however , we can consider plausible physical mechanisms that produce small deviations from the gaussian behavior and thus analyze the following two models for the primordial non - gaussianity ( e.g. , coles & barrow 1987 , vwhk00 , mvj ) .",
    "in the first model , we suppose that the fractional density perturbation @xmath0 is a non - gaussian random field that can be written in terms of a gaussian random field @xmath1 through ( model a ) @xmath2 in the second model , we suppose that the primordial gravitational potential @xmath3 is a non - gaussian random field that can be written in terms of a gaussian random field @xmath1 through ( model b ) @xmath4 non - gaussianity in the density field is then obtained from that in the potential through the poisson equation . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to the _ primordial _ gravitational potential and density perturbation , before the action of the transfer function that takes place near matter - radiation equality .",
    "although not fully general , these models may be considered as the lowest - order terms in taylor expansions of more general fields , and are thus quite general for small deviations from gaussianity .",
    "the scale - dependence of the non - gaussianity in the two models differs .",
    "model a produces deviations from gaussianity that are roughly scale - independent on large scales , while model b produces deviations from non - gaussianity that become larger at larger distance scales .",
    "although we choose these models essentially in an _ ad hoc _ way , the non - gaussianity of model b is precisely that arising in standard slow - roll inflation and in non - standard ( e.g. , multifield ) inflation (; see also below ) .",
    "model a more closely resembles the non - gaussianity that would be expected from topological defects ( e.g. , vwhk00 ) . in either case ,",
    "the lowest - order deviations from non - gaussianity ( and those expected generically to be the most easily observed ) are the three - point correlation function ( including the skewness , its zero - lag value ) or equivalently the bispectrum , its fourier - space counterpart .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate these quantities for both models a and b.      temperature fluctuations in the cmb come from density perturbations at the surface of last scatter , so the distribution of temperature fluctuations reflects that in the primordial density field .",
    "it is thus straightforward to relate the density - field bispectra of models a and b to the bispectrum of the cmb .",
    "density perturbations in the universe today grew via gravitational infall from primordial perturbations in the early universe , and this process alters the mass distribution in a calculable way .",
    "cosmological perturbation theory allows the bispectrum for the mass distribution in the universe today to be related to that for the primordial distribution .",
    "vwhk00 calculated the smallest values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 that would be accessible with the cmb and with lss . for the cmb calculation",
    ", it was assumed that a temperature map could be measured to the cosmic - variance limit only for multipole moments @xmath9 ; it was assumed ( quite conservatively ) that no information would be obtained from larger multipole moments .",
    "the lss calculation were made under the very optimistic assumption that the distribution of mass could be determined precisely from the galaxy distribution ( i.e. , that there was no biasing ) in a survey of the size of sdss and/or 2df .",
    "vwhk00 found that the smallest values of @xmath10 that can be detected with the cmb under these assumptions is @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( including noise and foreground but neglecting dust contamination found that @xmath13 from the planck experiment ) , while the smallest values measurable with lss are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "more realistically , the galaxy distribution will be biased relative to the mass distribution , and this will degrade the sensitivities to nonzero @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtainable with lss .",
    "vwhk00 thus concluded that the cmb will provide a keener probe of primordial non - gaussianity for the class of models considered .      according to the press - schechter theory ,",
    "the abundance of high - redshift and/or massive objects is determined by the form of the high - density tail of the primordial density distribution function .",
    "a probability distribution function ( pdf ) that produces a larger number of @xmath16 peaks than a gaussian distribution will lead to a larger abundance of rare high - redshift and/or massive objects . since small deviations from gaussianity have deep impact on those statistics that probe the tail of the distribution ( e.g. , mvj ) , rare high - redshift and/or massive objects should be powerful probes of primordial non gaussianity .",
    "the number densities of high - redshift galaxies and/or of clusters ( at either low or high redshifts ) provides a very sensitive probe of the pdf .",
    "since the gaussian tail is decaying exponentially at higher densities , even a small deviation from gaussianity can lead to huge enhancements in the number densities .",
    "the non - gaussianity parameters @xmath17 are effectively `` tail enhancement '' parameters ( c.f . ,",
    "mvj ) or @xmath8 , if the pdf is not too non - gaussian .",
    "it is easy to understand this statement if one thinks in terms of skewness .",
    "physical mechanisms that produce non - gaussianity generically produce non - zero skewness in the pdf for the simple reason that underdense region can not be more empty than voids while overdense regions can become arbitrarily overdense .",
    "skewness can be scale dependent , but for a given value of the skewness there is one - to - one correspondence to @xmath18 parameters ( see the appendix ) . ] in order to determine the minimum value of @xmath19 that can be detected using high - redshift objects , one needs to compute by how much the observed number density of objects changes with respect to the gaussian case when the primordial field is described by equations ( [ firstngmap ] ) and ( [ secondngmap ] ) .",
    "we calculate this enhancement using the results for the mass function for mildly non - gaussian initial conditions obtained analytically in mvj .",
    "conservatively , we make the assumption that objects form at the same redshift at which they are observed ( @xmath20 ) ; since for some objects the dark halo will have collapsed before we observe them , the assumption gives a _ lower limit _ to the amount of non - gaussianity .",
    "the directly observed quantity , however , is not the mass function , but is @xmath21 , the total number of objects in the survey area of mass @xmath22 that collapse at redshift @xmath23 .",
    "in fact it is extremely difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the mass of high - redshift objects , what is a more robust quantity is the minimum mass that these objects must have in order to be detected at that redshift .",
    "this quantity is related to the mass function , @xmath24 , by n(m , z)=_m^n(m , z)dm .    in calculating the enhancement of high - redshift objects due to primordial non - gaussianity , we restrict ourselves to consider , at any given redshift , only those masses , @xmath25 for which at least one object is expected in the whole sky for gaussian initial conditions ( @xmath26 in @xmath27 radians )",
    "is motivated by the following considerations .",
    "of course it is not robust to detect a non - gaussianity that suppresses the number of objects with respect to the gaussian prediction , since one can always argue that one did not look hard enough , or that the objects are there but are somewhat `` invisible '' .",
    "so we set to detect a non - gaussianity that enhances the number of objects relative to the gaussian case .",
    "if within gaussian initial conditions we expect @xmath28 in the whole sky , and observations find @xmath29 in the survey area , we can say that we have detected non - gaussianity . however , the non - gaussianity ( or tail enhancement ) parameter is directly related to the ratio of observed @xmath30 to the gaussian predicted @xmath31 ( see eq .",
    "obviously this ratio is well defined for any @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but the observed @xmath34 can only be an integer @xmath35 .",
    "the tail enhancement parameter will then make @xmath36 ( and we consider only cases where @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is reasonable therefore to consider only those masses and redshift for which the theoretical prediction for the gaussian @xmath38 is @xmath35 . ] .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 for a @xmath39cdm model ( hereafter we adopt the currently favored cosmological model with parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and transfer function of with @xmath44 ) where the shaded region encloses predictions for @xmath45 from different mass functions ( e.g. , ) .    given the rapidly dying tail of the gaussian pdf , small uncertainties in the mass determination of high - redshift objects could lead to overestimate the value of @xmath19 .",
    "an overabundance of galaxies of estimated mass @xmath46 , which in principle can be attributed to a non - zero value of @xmath18 , can also be explained under the hypothesis of gaussian initial conditions if the actual galaxy mass @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "we thus include conservative values for the uncertainty @xmath49 in the mass determination of high - redshift objects and we then calculate the minimum change @xmath50 in the number density of objects over the gaussian case that can not be attributed to the uncertainty in the mass determination . for a given uncertainty in the mass ,",
    "this can be computed by using the standard press - schechter ( ps ) theory @xcite .",
    "observationally it is difficult to measure the mass of high - redshift clusters with accuracy better than 30% , with either weak lensing or the x - ray temperature , and of high - redshift galaxies better than a factor 2 ( @xmath51 ; at least of their stellar mass ) .",
    "although the calculations in this section are obtained using the standard ps theory , our conclusions will be essentially unchanged if we had used modified ps theories ( e.g. , ; see below ) .    with the mass uncertainties discussed above",
    ", we obtain that the minimum @xmath50 that can not be attributed to @xmath49 is a factor 10 for clusters and a factor 100 for galaxies ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "6 of mvj00 ) .",
    "we therefore estimate the minimum @xmath19 that can be measured from the abundance of high - redshift objects as the one that corresponds respectively to a factor 100 and 10 change in the observed number density of objects ( @xmath21 ) over the gaussian case . this condition can be written as n_ng(m , z)/n(m , z)r(m , z)r _ * , where @xmath38 is obtained using the gaussian mass function while @xmath52 is obtained using the non - gaussian mass function as in mvj , and @xmath53 is set to be 100 for galaxies and 10 for clusters .    for small primordial non - gaussianity ( i.e. , for small values for @xmath54 ) , it is possible to derive an expression for @xmath55 using the analytical approximation for the mass function @xmath56 found in mvj . doing so we find    @xmath57f(m , z_c,\\eps_{\\rm a , b})dm } { \\int_m^{\\infty}(\\sigma_mm)^{-1}\\exp[-\\frac{\\delta_c^2(z_c ) } { 2\\sigma_m^2}]\\left|\\frac{d\\sigma_m}{dm}\\right|dm}\\;. \\label{ratio}\\ ] ]    here , f(m ,",

    "( 90,55 )    however , for @xmath63 , the mass function @xmath64 has to be evaluated numerically and equation ( [ ratio ] ) is not valid .    for the cosmological model considered here and the redshifts of interest , the quantity @xmath59 takes a nearly constant value ( @xmath65 ) in the ps theory",
    ". a better fit to the mass function of halos in high - resolution n - body simulations is however obtained by lowering @xmath59 for rare objects and giving it an extra mass and redshift dependence (; ) , as motivated by ellipsoidal collapse ( e.g. , ) .",
    "it is possible to understand the effect of a lower @xmath59 by the following argument . for rare fluctuations such as high - redshift objects one is probing the mass function above the knee .",
    "since the mass function drops very rapidly as @xmath66 increases we can approximate @xmath67 .",
    "it is then possible to obtain an analytic expression for @xmath68 if the primordial non - gaussianity is small : r(m , z_c ) | + | .    for a given mass @xmath66",
    ", @xmath69 slowly decreases when lowering @xmath59 , slightly damping the effect of non - gaussianity .",
    "for example when lowering @xmath59 from the value we assume here 1.686 , to the value @xmath70appropriate to fit the numerical mass function of for the range of masses and redshifts considered here@xmath69 decreases by less than a factor 2 .",
    "however this effect is compensated by the fact that , by lowering @xmath59 , objects are created more easily also with gaussian initial conditions , and it is therefore possible to consider objects of higher @xmath66 and/or @xmath23 , where the effect of non - gaussianity is bigger . in summary , the conclusions obtained by assuming @xmath71 will not be substantially modified .",
    "it is important to note that for model a , the primordial skewness has the same sign as @xmath72 , while for model b the primordial skewness has the opposite sign of that of @xmath73 . in detecting non - zero @xmath19 from cmb maps , the sign of the skewness",
    "does not influence the accuracy of the detection of non - gaussianity , but , when using the abundance of high - redshift objects the sign of the skewness matters .",
    "only a positively skewed primordial distribution will generate more high - redshift objects than predicted in the gaussian case .",
    "although a negatively skewed probability distribution will generate fewer objects than the gaussian case , a decrement might be difficult to attribute exclusively to a negatively skewed distribution .",
    "therefore in the following we will consider only negative @xmath73 and positive @xmath72",
    ".      showed that the size - temperature ( st ) distribution of clusters is fairly sensitive to the degree of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "if clusters are created from rare gaussian peaks , the spread in formation redshift should be small and so should the scatter in the st distribution .",
    "conversely , if the probability distribution function has long non - gaussian tails , then clusters of a given mass we observe today should have a broader formation redshift distribution and thus a broader st relation . in , the non - gaussianity considered is a log - normal distribution ; it is not strictly equivalent to models a or b considered here .",
    "however , for small deviations from gaussianity , the two models can be identified if , for a given scale , they produce the same skewness in the density fluctuation field .",
    "we thus find that in the @xmath39cdm model the minimum @xmath7 and @xmath8 detectable with the st distribution method are @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "these estimates assume that the cosmology and @xmath76 are well known , but use only the local cluster data set of . of course",
    ", with improved observational data , the st method could probably yield stronger constraints .",
    "we find that the non - gaussianity of model a has a bigger effect on high - redshift galaxies than on high - redshift clusters .",
    "this can be understood for the following reason . for model",
    "a the skewness @xmath60 is approximately scale independent ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "thus , as found in mvj , the mass function for non - gaussian initial conditions is obtained from the ps mass function for gaussian initial conditions replacing @xmath78 .",
    "the effect of a non - zero skewness is therefore to lower the effective threshold for collapse thus allowing more objects to be created . for a given @xmath79 , @xmath80 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath81 .",
    "since galaxies can be observed at @xmath81 much bigger than that of clusters , the effect is bigger . on the other hand ,",
    "clusters are better probes than galaxies for model b. in fact , for model b the induced skewness in the density field is scale dependent and the effect of non - gaussianity is roughly the same for galaxies with @xmath82 and clusters with @xmath83 .",
    "however since mass determinations are more accurate for clusters than for galaxies , we have @xmath84 : clusters are therefore better probes .    in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we show the ratio @xmath85 ( cf .",
    "( 5 ) ) for galaxies at redshift @xmath86 and 10 for @xmath87 ( model a , left panel ) and clusters at redshift @xmath88 and 3 for @xmath89 ( model b , right panel ) , as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "lines are plotted only for masses where , for gaussian initial conditions , one would expect to observe at least one object in the whole sky with the most conservative estimate ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "note that those high - redshift objects represent 3- to 5-@xmath90 peaks .",
    "if we now require @xmath91 , we deduce that the minimum detectable deviation from gaussian initial conditions will be @xmath92 ( from high - redshift galaxies ) and @xmath93 ( from high - redshift clusters ) .",
    "we also estimate that an uncertainty of 10% on @xmath76 would propagate into an uncertainty of 25% in @xmath8 ( from clusters ) and of 70% in @xmath7 ( from galaxies ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath8 detectable from high - redshift cluster abundances is much larger than the value that can be measured from the cmb ( @xmath94 to @xmath95 for planck data ) , while for @xmath72 , high - redshift galaxies are much better probes than the cmb , which can only detect @xmath96 .",
    "we therefore conclude that _ if _ future ngst or 30- to 100-m ground - based telescope observations of high - redshift galaxies yield a significant number of galaxies at @xmath97 _ and _ are able to determine their masses within a factor 2 , these observations will perform better than cmb maps in constraining primordial non - gaussianity of the form of model a with positive @xmath72 .",
    "conversely , forthcoming cmb maps will constrain deviations from gaussianity in the initial conditions much better than observations of high - redshift objects for model b ( with positive _ and _ negative value for @xmath73 ) and for model a with negative @xmath72 .",
    "the type of non - gaussianity of model b is particularly interesting because initial conditions set from standard inflation show deviations from gaussianity of this kind .",
    "in fact , it is possible to relate the two slow roll parameters ,    @xmath98 , \\label{slowrollparam}\\ ] ]    to the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath73 . in equation ( [ slowrollparam ] )",
    "@xmath99 is the planck mass , @xmath100 denotes the inflaton potential and @xmath101 and @xmath102 the first and second derivatives with respect to the scalar field . the skewness @xmath79 for @xmath103 , @xmath104 ,",
