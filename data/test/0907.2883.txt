    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are x - ray sources composed of an early - type massive star and an accreting compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "the vast majority of hmxbs contain x - ray pulsars ( magnetised neutron stars ) and can be characterised by their pulse period , which corresponds to the spin period of the neutron star @xmath0 .",
    "a few systems are considered good black hole candidates .",
    "the presence of an x - ray pulsar has allowed the determination of orbital parameters for a large number of systems via analysis of doppler shifts in the pulse arrival times ( e.g. , schreier et al .",
    "1972 ; rappaport et al .",
    "1978 ) .",
    "since so many parameters may be known , hmxbs represent important laboratories to study a large number of fundamental astrophysical questions . among them",
    ", we can cite the masses of neutron stars and their equation of state ( e.g. , kaper 1998 ; quaintrell et al . 2003 ; van der meer 2007 ) .",
    "also , because of their young age , they may act as tracers of star formation ( e.g. , grimm et al .",
    "2003 ; lutovinov et al .",
    "when considered as a population , they can provide information on properties of galaxies ( e.g. , gilfanov et al . 2004 ) .",
    "finally , they represent an important phase of massive binary evolution and , again considered as a whole , can provide strong constraints on binary evolution and the mechanisms for the formation of neutron stars and black holes ( e.g. , van bever & vanbeveren 2000 ; brown et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a recent list of known hmxbs is provided by liu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "hmxbs can be divided in several subgroups , depending on their x - ray properties , which are found to depend fundamentally on the nature of the massive star donating mass .",
    "corbet ( 1986 ) found that the position of an object in the orbital period vs. spin period ( @xmath1/@xmath0 ) diagram correlates well with other physical properties , allowing the definition of meaningful subgroups :    * a few objects with very close orbits and short @xmath0 are observed as very bright ( @xmath2 ) persistent x - ray sources , with clear evidence for an accretion disc .",
    "their neutron stars are spinning up most of the time , because angular momentum is transferred with the material accreted . *",
    "many systems with be star counterparts are x - ray transients , showing very low x - ray fluxes in quiescence ( @xmath3 ; e.g. , campana et al .",
    "2002 ) and luminosities close to the eddington limit for a neutron star ( @xmath4 ) during bright outbursts . in spite of their short duty cycles , the majority of known hmxbs are be / x - ray transients , suggesting that they represent the dominant population .",
    "their x - ray characteristics are explained as a consequence of mass loss from the be star in the form of a keplerian disc ( okazaki & negueruela 2001 ) .",
    "be / x - ray binaries populate a rather narrow region of the @xmath5/@xmath0 diagram .",
    "the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 is believed to be connected to some physical equilibrium between the spin down of the neutron stars when they are not accreting and their spin up during outbursts , indicative of the formation of transitory accretion discs ( stella et al .",
    "1986 ; waters & van kerkwijk 1989 ; wilson et al .",
    "* a second large group is formed by systems with ob supergiant donors and long-@xmath0 neutron stars .",
    "these objects , known as supergiant x - ray binaries ( sgxbs ) are moderately bright ( @xmath6 ) persistent x - ray sources with a large degree of short - term variability .",
    "their characteristics are attributed to direct accretion from the wind of the supergiant on to the compact object .",
    "this mode of accretion is known as wind accretion , and , as we will discuss , it is believed to occur without the formation of a stable accretion disc .",
    "recent discoveries , however , are showing that the division of hmxbs into different groups , though physically meaningful , is not strict .",
    "apparent exceptions have been found , which may perhaps be due to infrequent evolutionary stages ( cf .",
    "chaty , these proceedings ) .",
    "luminous ob stars produce powerful winds due to line scattering of the continuum radiation flux from the star ( see kudritzki & puls 2000 , for a review ) .",
    "material is accelerated outwards from the stellar atmosphere to a final velocity @xmath7 according to a law that may be approximated as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radius of the ob star and @xmath10 is a factor generally lying in the interval @xmath11 .    in these circumstances ,",
    "high wind velocities are reached at a moderate height above the star s surface ( for example , for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the wind is highly supersonic and the wind speed is much higher than the orbital velocity of the neutron star @xmath15 at @xmath16 ) . under those conditions",
    ", the classical bondi - hoyle - lyttleton formulation represents an approximation to the accretion process .",
    "a comprehensive review of bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion is presented by edgar ( 2004 ) .    in this approximation ,",
    "the accretion rate ( @xmath17 ) of a neutron star immersed in a fast wind is governed by its accretion radius , the maximum distance at which its gravitational potential well can deflect the stellar wind and focus the outflowing material towards the neutron star , given by @xmath18 where the relative velocity of the accreted material with respect to the neutron star is @xmath19 . for typical values of @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 , decreasing by a factor of a few from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the accretion rate is then @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the wind density .",
    "if we assume a certain efficiency factor in the transformation of gravitational energy into x - ray luminosity , the x - ray luminosity will be proportional to @xmath26    this dependency means that , in this approximation , the x - ray luminosity of a neutron star in a circular orbit is constant . in an eccentric orbit ,",
    "the luminosity varies with orbital phase .",
    "different systems differ in their orbital parameters ( semi - major axis , eccentricity ) and wind properties ( mass loss rate , velocity law and terminal velocity ) .",
    "figure  1 is a simple diagram showing the dependence of the x - ray luminosity on these parameters .",
    "a transformation factor @xmath27 is assumed .",
    "[ fig : lx ]",
    "direct application of the simple model outlined above is able to crudely reproduce the average order of magnitude x - ray luminosity of real sgxbs @xcite .",
    "however , their x - ray lightcurves provide strong evidence for a much more complex physical situation . the x - ray lightcurves of wind accreting systems are dominated by short - term ( timescale of hundreds of seconds ) variability , with flux changes by a factor of a few ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pulse periods of well - monitored sgxbs , such as vela x-1 , display random variations around an average value @xcite .",
    "these variations can occur on short ( days ) timescales @xcite , superimposed on longer - timescale trends @xcite .",
    "the behaviour has been described as a random walk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and interpreted as short episodes of angular momentum accretion .",
    "some systems have shown very long term trends .",
    "for example , 4u  1907 + 09 showed persistent spin down , at an almost constant rate , during more than ten years .",
    "afterwards , it changed to a lower spin - down rate and finally started spinning up @xcite .",
    "these `` torque reversals '' have been taken as evidence for accretion discs that rotate in alternating senses @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these torque reversals are not only seen in wind - fed systems , but also in systems that always accrete from a disc , such as cen x-3 @xcite .    in order to explain this behaviour , the complex physics of sgxbs",
    "must be considered . in short , we may identify three main ways in which the actual physical process of accretion differs from the idealised formulation of the previous section :    1 .",
    "the winds of massive stars are highly structured",
    "accretion on to a very small object is an unstable process .",
    "the magnetic field of the neutron star may affect the flow of material .      from the early days of radiation driven wind theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , it was obvious that winds from hot stars should be highly unstable to small - scale perturbations .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the driving mechanism and therefore an intrinsic property of the wind , which can not be smooth , but must be highly structured .",
    "observations of wind lines in ob stars have revealed the presence of large - scale ( quasi)cyclical structures , which may be induced by instabilities generated by the star itself ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , theory predicts the existence of smaller - scale stochastic structure , caused by the appearance of shocks in the wind flow , directly related to its intrinsic instability . in simulations ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , irregular variations in both density and velocity develop at a small height above the photosphere , leading to the appearance of structure already at a distance @xmath28 from the centre of the star , where the wind has only reached about half its terminal velocity .",
    "the variations steepen into shocks that decelerate and compress rarefied gas , collecting most of the mass into a sequence of dense clumps bounded by shocks , which definitely dominate the wind structure beyond @xmath29 @xcite and perhaps much closer to the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "the observational evidence for these clumps is , at present , indirect .",
    "structured winds with numerous internal shocks are considered necessary to explain x - ray emission from isolated hot stars @xcite .",
    "a clumpy structure was also invoked to explain the overall non - thermal radio emission from early - type stars , though this is now debated @xcite .",
    "recent model fits to optical and uv spectra of b - type supergiants seem to require a substantial amount of clumping @xcite .",
    "the observed stochastic variability on short timescales of h@xmath30 profiles in o - type stars is consistent with the predictions of wind models with clumping @xcite . in spite of all this ,",
    "as we have no direct observations of wind clumps , even their most basic parameters ( size , geometry , density ) are unknown .",
    "some authors find compelling reasons to argue for geometrically large , very massive clumps @xcite , but this is hotly debated . in any case , the approximation of a smooth wind of constant density must be considered unrealistic .    in addition , the overall geometry of the wind is the subject of debate .",
    "radiation driven wind theory assumes a spherical geometry , but other physical effects , such as stellar rotation and magnetic fields , may cause important deviations . some indirect evidence for the presence of equatorially enhanced mass loss , perhaps associated to magnetic fields , has been presented @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the nebulae ejected by some massive stars are decidedly bipolar , suggesting enhanced mass loss at the poles @xcite .      in the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton approximation",
    ", particles follow ballistic trajectories and are accreted without any net transfer of angular momentum . however , from the very earliest numerical calculations , it was clear that accretion flows should be more complicated .",
    "initial hydrodynamical simulations were carried out in two dimensions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or considering an axisymmetric three - dimensional problem ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but many 3d schemes have been developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of the flow depend on the thermodynamical properties of the gas accreted and the size of the accretor ( cf .",
    ", for instance , ruffert 1994 ; ruffert & anzer 1995 , and other papers in that series ) . the accretion rate predicted by the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton scheme turns out to be a good approximation , but the accretion flow is much more complex than assumed , especially as more realistic physics are included ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "bow shocks form and complex structure develops around the accretor . in the case when the mass donor fills an important fraction of its roche lobe , as happens in most sgxbs , the accretion flow is especially complicated @xcite .    when a density or velocity gradient is introduced in the accretion flow",
    ", it becomes possible to accrete angular momentum .",
    "high resolution 2d simulations by @xcite found that the accretion flow does not approach a steady state , but becomes unstable .",
    "the shock cone oscillates from one side of the accretor to the other , allowing the appearance of transient accretion discs .",
    "this instability , generally known as `` flip - flop '' oscillation , has been studied by a large number of authors , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the instability produces fluctuations in the accretion rate and gives rise to stochastic accretion of positive and negative angular momentum , leading to the suggestion that it is the source of the variations seen in the pulse evolution of sgxbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the timescales and amplitudes of these fluctuations are too small to explain the spin variations , though larger amplitudes were found in 2d simulations by @xcite .",
    "if the accretion flow is stable , the amount of angular momentum transferred to the neutron star is negligible .",
    "the more unstable the accretion flow , the higher the transfer rate of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the results of simulations depend strongly on the procedure used . in general",
    ", the instability seems to appear when the physical size of the accretor is very small , but full 3d simulations are always much more stable than 2d simulations .",
    "indeed , several 3d simulations showed stable flows , rising the possibility that the flip - flop instability could be just a numerical artifact @xcite .",
    "a critical review of existing work is presented by @xcite , who suggest that the instability is most likely physical in origin , related to the coupling of advected perturbations to acoustic waves .",
    "recent high - fidelity 2d numerical simulations @xcite confirm that the flip - flop instability does not require any gradient in the upstream flow to develop , and that it is much stronger when the accretor is very small .",
    "if the accretor is sufficiently small , the secular evolution is described by sudden jumps between states with counter - rotating quasi - keplerian accretion disks .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic instability of the accretion flow , in a real sgxb , the presence of the neutron star has an impact on the wind dynamics @xcite .",
    "it may dynamically induce an enhancement of the mass loss ( leading to the formation of an accretion stream ; cf .",
    "blondin et al . 1991 ) and it may even induce the supergiant to pulsate @xcite . also , if the neutron star is actively emitting x - rays , it can impact on the wind by photo - ionising the heavy elements that drive the outflow . in this way",
    ", it may slow down the wind , effectively increasing the accretion radius ( blondin et al .",
    "1991 ) . indeed ,",
    "the photo - ionisation effect of the x - ray source is readily visible in the ultraviolet spectra of sgxbs .",
    "wind lines show pronounced orbital variability @xcite .",
    "far ultraviolet spectra of the counterpart to 4u  1700@xmath3137 show important changes in the ionisation structure of the wind with the binary phase , suggesting that the x - ray source ionises much of the wind @xcite . in the optical counterpart",
    "to vela x-1 , optical spectra reveal additional absorption components on the wings of photospheric lines at inferior conjunction of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "these features are attributed to the presence of a photo - ionisation wake trailing the neutron star .",
    "the complexity of the accretion environment can provide an explanation to the short - term variability of the x - ray lightcurves of sgxbs .",
    "simulations by @xcite showed that the accretion wake trailing the neutron star contains dense filaments ( up to 100 times denser than the undisturbed wind ) .",
    "their accretion may produce abrupt changes in x - ray luminosity .",
    "the neutron stars in sgxbs are young , and possess strong ( @xmath32  g ) magnetic fields . as material approaches the neutron star , it is captured by the magnetic field and deflected along the magnetic field lines .",
    "many situations are possible , depending on the relative strengths of the magnetic field and the ram pressure of the incoming material @xcite .",
    "if the ram pressure is low , the incoming material may be stopped at the magnetosphere , and the neutron star may then be in the propeller regime @xcite .",
    "accretion is then told to be centrifugally inhibited .",
    "if the magnetic field is strong enough to affect the flow beyond the accretion radius , there will be magnetic inhibition of the accretion @xcite .    though changes in the accretion state have been invoked to explain the behaviour of be / x - ray transients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetic effects have not been traditionally considered while explaining the long - term evolution of sgxbs . however , the spin fluctuations ( which are also seen in systems with an accretion disc ; e.g. , bildsten 1997 ) are highly suggestive of magnetic interaction between the accretion disk and the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite argued that a disc or torus could form around the magnetosphere and interact with it , acting as a reservoir of mass and angular momentum .",
    "this interaction represents a possible way to provide the neutron star with enough angular momentum to explain random variations in pulse period , though @xcite estimate that magnetic fields too high by an order of magnitude are needed for the torque to be effective .",
    "though vela x-1 is probably the best studied sgxb , an important effort has also been dedicated to understanding a very special system , gx  301@xmath312 .",
    "this wind accreting x - ray pulsar differs from other sgxbs in two very important aspects : first , its orbit is wider ( @xmath33  d ) and more eccentric ( @xmath34 ) than those of other systems ; second , the mass donor is a b1ia@xmath35 hypergiant , implying that it is larger than the donors in other systems and has a denser , slower wind . because of these characteristics , the x - ray luminosity is strongly modulated at the orbital period , the flux close to periastron is @xmath36 times higher than at other phases , peaking 12  d before periastron ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the varying conditions along the orbit make gx  301@xmath312 a very good test of different accretion models .",
    "gx  301@xmath312 occasionally undergoes rapid spin - up episodes , lasting a few weeks , which have been attributed to the formation of transient accretion discs @xcite . in order to explain the existence of strong periastron and weak apastron flares",
    ", @xcite postulated the presence of circumstellar disc around the hypergiant , perhaps in the form of a collimated , denser equatorial wind .",
    "optical observations of the mass donor , however , do not show any evidence for such a disc @xcite .",
    "in fact , the size of the hypergiant is such that it may be very close to filling its roche lobe when the neutron star is at periastron @xcite , allowing the formation of an accretion stream .",
    "some indications of the existence of such a stream are seen in optical spectra of the companion @xcite .",
    "the average x - ray lightcurve of gx  301@xmath312 can be successfully fit by a model that considers accretion from a spherical wind and an accretion stream @xcite . as a matter of fact , in this model ,",
    "most of the x - ray luminosity is due to accretion of dense material from the stream , rather than direct wind accretion .",
    "over the last few years , there has been a huge increase in the number of hmxbs known .",
    "many of these systems are believed to be wind accretors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "several new sgxbs have been found , most of them heavily obscured .",
    "many other sources , however , have been found to display very brief outbursts , with a rise timescale of tens of minutes and lasting only a few hours @xcite .",
    "they have been identified with ob supergiants : ( e.g. , the prototype xte  j1739@xmath31302 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to the definition of a class of supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distances to their counterparts imply typical @xmath37 at the peak of the outbursts .",
    "outside outburst , they display rather lower luminosities ( between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , depending on the particular system ; @xcite ) .    as the number of these new systems increases , it is becoming clear that the separation between sfxts and sgxbs is not well defined @xcite .",
    "some systems behave as sgxbs during part of their orbits ( e.g. , sax  j1818.6@xmath311703 , zurita heras & chaty 2008 ; igr  j18483@xmath310311 , rahoui & chaty 2008 ) , and all show spectra and lightcurves typical of wind accretion .    explaining the behaviour of these sources has become a major challenge for our models of wind accretion . in some systems ,",
    "variability is obviously related to orbital motion .",
    "the orbital period of sax  j1818.6@xmath311703 , for example , is 30  d , and so its orbit is wider than those of sgxbs , meaning that the neutron star is most of the time further away from the donor than in the persistent systems .",
    "however , geometry alone does not seem able to explain all the differences .",
    "the idea that the flares are related to accretion of wind clumps was advanced by @xcite and developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculated with the possibility that the development of clumps made accretion less efficient when the neutron star was relatively distant from the mass donor .",
    "alternatively , @xcite proposed that the outbursts were associated with the crossing of a thin circumstellar disc surrounding the supergiant .",
    "other authors have suggested that the reason of the outbursts must be sought in the interaction of the wind with the magnetosphere @xcite , though @xcite calculated that this was only plausible if the neutron stars in sfxts had magnetic fields two or three orders of magnitude stronger than those in sgxbs .",
    "@xcite suggested that the x - ray lightcurves of sgxbs could be tracing directly the matter density met by the neutron star . in this way",
    ", the neutron star could be used as a probe of the stellar wind .",
    "unfortunately , detailed observations of outbursts from sfxts do not support the idea that each outburst can be identified with the accretion of a wind clump .",
    "the outbursts last many hours ( or even days ) and are generally multi - peaked .",
    "many of them are also very asymmetric , with fast rises and slow decays , casting doubt on the possibility that they may be caused by direct accretion during passage through a disc .",
    "moreover , intensive monitoring of sgxbs has also revealed new phenomenology , which increases the similarity to sfxts .",
    "vela x-1 has been observed to display `` giant '' flares , which resemble very closely the outbursts of sfxts , with flux increases of @xmath40 and a timescale of a few hours @xcite .",
    "conversely , it has also been found to display `` off states '' , during which the flux decreases orders of magnitude and the pulse period is not detectable . @xcite",
    "discuss the differences and similarities of sgxbs and sfxts in the context of a scenario in which wind clumping , the highly structured accretion flow and the magnetic field all play a role .",
    "more recently , the discovery that the sfxt igr  j16479@xmath314514 has an orbital period of only 3.3  d @xcite , and that its outbursts appear to be locked in phase @xcite , has posed a strong challenge to all the models developed .",
    "once more , the physics of wind accretion reveals its complexity .",
    "a handful of hmxbs produce @xmath41-rays . to this day",
    ", two very different models have been proposed to explain their behaviour ( see these proceedings ) . in both , the stellar winds play an important role , but accretion is an important element in only one of them .    of the @xmath41-ray binaries , ls  2883/psr",
    "b1259@xmath3163 is the only one for which a model is universally accepted .",
    "psr b1259@xmath3163 is a radio pulsar in a very wide an eccentric orbit ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) around the be star ls  2883 .",
    "timing of the radio pulses provides an accurate orbital solution @xcite . as the neutron star approaches periastron , it interacts with the disc around the be star and radio pulses are quenched .",
    "the interaction between the pulsar wind and the be star outflow produces shocked material , where particles are efficiently accelerated to relativistic velocities .",
    "@xcite proposed a number of feasible mechanisms to explain the production of high - energy photons .",
    "however , it must be noted that they used a radial outflow model for the mass loss of be stars @xcite .",
    "this model has subsequently been ruled out by observations , which strongly support a keplerian disc around be stars @xcite .",
    "new modelling is necessary for this system ( cf .",
    "naito , these proceedings ) .",
    "the @xmath41-ray binary ls i + 61@xmath44303 is similar to ls  2883/psr b1259@xmath3163 in the sense that the mass donor is an early be star and the orbit is highly eccentric @xcite .",
    "the orbital period is , however , much shorter ( 26 d ) . in the third @xmath41-ray binary ,",
    "ls  5039 , the situation is very different , as the mass donor is an o6.5v star in a close orbit @xcite .",
    "the wind structure is expected to be extremely different from those in the be systems .",
    "however , it is worth noting that our knowledge of the winds of these systems is completely indirect . only ls i + 61@xmath44303 was observed on a few occasions by iue , but the spectra are of low quality @xcite .",
    "moreover , with the small sample known , we have been unable to identify the key ingredients necessary to have a @xmath41-ray binary .",
