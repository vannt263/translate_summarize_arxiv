    "embeddings are dense in the space of immersions of a curve to a 3-manifold . hence any immersion of a collection of circles to a 3-manifold",
    "can be turned by a small regular homotopy into a differentiable embedding .",
    "usually , the ambient isotopy type of an embedding , which can be obtained from a given immersion by an arbitrarily small ( in @xmath1-topology ) regular homotopy , is not entirely determined by the immersion . on the other hand , for any immersion there are ambient isotopy types which can not be obtained from it .",
    "the main results of this paper imply the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth closed 1-manifold .",
    "for any immersion @xmath3 , its composition with the standard inclusion @xmath4 is regularly homotopic via an arbitrarily small regular homotopy to an embedding @xmath5 , which depends , up to ambient isotopy and composition with a self - diffeomorphism of @xmath2 , only on the homotopy class of @xmath6 . in other words , @xmath7 is ambiently isotopic to a standard nonoriented unlink @xmath8 which depends , up to ambient isotopy , only on the number @xmath9 of its components contractible in @xmath10 and the number @xmath11 of its components non contractible in @xmath10 .    from this theorem one can not eliminate self - diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "this is also proven below ( see section [ counter ] ) .",
    "this paper presents a way to unknot knots and unlink links in the real projective 3-space @xmath10 and the results formulated above appear as straightforward corollaries .",
    "it is shown how to obtain a diagram of the unknot or unlink , starting from an arbitrary diagram , and performing some crossing changes on it .",
    "this is done through an extension of the classical notion of descending diagram to diagrams of knots and links in @xmath10 .    in the case of knots in @xmath0 ,",
    "the notion of descending diagram was used to study some knot invariants such as jones polynomial , homfly polynomial or finite type invariants .",
    "one can calculate these invariants using appropriate skein relations and the fact that it is possible to make any link diagram descending , which would turn it to a diagram of the unlink .",
    "descending diagrams were used to define the homfly polynomial ( see for instance @xcite ) .    the notion of descending diagram for knots in @xmath10",
    "can be used to study some invariants of these knots .",
    "it can be useful when considering the homflypt module of @xmath10 .",
    "the jones polynomial was extended in @xcite by j. v. drobotukhina to knots in @xmath10 .",
    "an algorithm that makes a diagram descending gives an alternative way to calculate this polynomial .",
    "i wish to thank oleg viro for stimulating conversations and for his help .",
    "in the case of knots in @xmath0 there is a well - known way to obtain the unknot by doing some crossing changes on a diagram .",
    "we choose a starting point and proceed from this point according to some orientation of the knot .",
    "when we meet a crossing for the first time and arrive at the lower branch of the crossing , we change it in order to make this branch upper .",
    "if we arrive at a crossing for a second time , we leave it unchanged .",
    "finally we get back at the initial point .",
    "when we have done all these changes the diagram takes a special form : it is descending .",
    "we can imagine that the result is a diagram of a knot in which we descend from the initial point all the way ( a @xmath12 coordinate is decreased if @xmath12 is the axis along which we project the knot to the diagram ) . when we get back at a point which has the same projection as the initial point ( but is below it ) we join these two points with a segment .",
    "the resulting knot is the unknot .",
    "more generally , a link diagram can be unlinked with appropriate crossing changes , by putting different components one above an other ( choosing some order ) and making each component descending as above .",
    "a link diagram in @xmath10 is a disk with a collection of generically immersed arcs .",
    "an arc is a compact connected 1-manifold with or without boundary .",
    "the endpoints of arcs with boundary are on the boundary of the disk , divided into pairs of antipodal points .",
    "each double point of the immersions or _ crossing _ of the diagram is endowed with information of over- and undercrossing .",
    "an example of a knot diagram in @xmath10 is shown in figure [ knot1 ] .",
    "a link diagram is constructed from a link @xmath13 in the following way :    @xmath10 is represented as a ball @xmath14 with antipodal points of the bounding sphere identified .",
    "the link @xmath13 in @xmath10 is lifted to @xmath15 in @xmath14 .",
    "we can suppose that the poles of the ball are not in @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the projection of @xmath15 to the equatorial disk @xmath16 where a point in @xmath15 is projected along the metric circle in @xmath14 passing through this point and the poles of the ball .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 satisfies the following conditions of general position : @xmath17 contains no cusps , points of tangency , triple points ; @xmath15 intersects transversally the boundary of the ball ; no two points in @xmath15 lie on the same arc of the great circle joining the poles of the ball in the boundary of the ball .    the information of over- and undercrossings comes from some orientation of the circles along which @xmath15 is projected to @xmath16 ( for instance from north to south ) .",
    "if the link @xmath13 is oriented , we get naturally an _ oriented _ link diagram for which each arc is oriented .",
    "an orientation of a link diagram gives rise to a cyclic ordering of arcs ( when we travel on @xmath13 according to the orientation , we meet the arcs in this order ) .",
    "as for diagrams of links in @xmath0 , there are reidemeister moves for diagrams of links in @xmath10 .",
    "the five of them are pictured in figure [ reidemeister ] .",
    "these moves appeared in @xcite .",
    "a _ net _ is the projective plane @xmath18 with a distinguished line , called _ the line at infinity _ , and a collection of generically immersed circles together with information of over- and undercrossing for each double point .",
    "we can associate to each diagram @xmath19 of a link _ its net _ obtained from @xmath19 by identifying the antipodal points of the boundary circle of @xmath19 , with the line at infinity coming from this boundary circle .",
    "let @xmath19 be a diagram of a link and @xmath20 the part of @xmath19 coming from a component , @xmath21 , of the link .",
    "we will say that @xmath20 is a _",
    "diagrammatic component _ of @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 is oriented , then @xmath20 is also oriented .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be two points in the interior of some arcs of @xmath20 . then the _ arc distance _ between @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "is defined to be the number of times the line at infinity is crossed in the net of @xmath19 , if one travels from the image of @xmath22 to the image of @xmath23 in the net , according to the orientation of the image of @xmath20 in the net .",
    "suppose that @xmath24 is a crossing of @xmath19 such that at least one of its branches is in @xmath20 .",
    "then the _ first pass _ of @xmath24 from @xmath22 is , by definition , the branch of @xmath24 whose image in the net of @xmath19 is passed first , if one travels from the image of @xmath22 in the net , according to the orientation of the image of @xmath20 in the net .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath10 has two elements . in each of them",
    "there is a simple loop that is naturally called _ unknot_.",
    "a planar circle and a projective line are two unknots , up to isotopy .",
    "they are the only knots for which there are diagrams without crossings .",
    "a knot in @xmath10 is homotopic to one of the unknots depending on the element of the fundamental group it realizes .",
    "thus we can deform it to an unknot by a sequence of isotopies , which correspond to planar isotopies and reidemeister moves on the level of diagrams , and some homotopies , namely the ones which correspond to crossing changes on the level of diagrams .    in the next section",
    "we will see that for any diagram of a knot we can obtain a diagram of an unknot solely by some crossing changes .",
    "a natural question is whether , for knots in @xmath10 , there is a way to obtain a diagram of the unknot , by changing some crossings on an arbitrary diagram .",
    "the goal of this section is to give a positive answer to this question .    a _",
    "basepoint _ is a distinguished point of a diagram , distinct from crossings and endpoints of arcs .",
    "a diagram with a basepoint is called _",
    "based diagram_.    a based oriented diagram @xmath19 is called _ descending _ provided that for every crossing @xmath24 of @xmath19 , the first pass of @xmath24 from the basepoint is an overpass ( resp .",

    "first , note that if @xmath19 consists of a single arc without boundary , then @xmath19 is a diagram of 0-homologous unknot , because it is descending in the classical sense .    now suppose that @xmath19 is not of that type .",
    "denote the arcs of @xmath19 by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 contains the basepoint and @xmath28 are ordered according to the orientation of @xmath19 .",
    "the arc @xmath27 can be divided in two parts : one that comes after the basepoint ( according to the orientation ) and the other one that comes before the basepoint .",

    "an arc , or a part of it is said to be _ below _ another one if at each crossing between the two of them the branch of the first one is below the branch of the second one .",
    "if @xmath31 is below @xmath20 , we write @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that in the descending diagram @xmath19 the following relation holds :    @xmath33    observe that each arc is descending or ascending .",
    "also @xmath29 and @xmath30 are descending or ascending .",
    "we will show that @xmath19 is a diagram of an unknot by constructing a sequence of reidemeister moves from @xmath19 to a diagram without crossings .",
    "as each arc is descending or ascending we kill all the crossings between an arc and itself with some @xmath34 moves .",
    "we do the same with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    now consider figure [ isotopy ] .",
    "we want to reduce the number of arcs by eliminating @xmath35 .",
    "one of its boundary points , say @xmath22 , is antipodal to a boundary point of @xmath29 .",
    "denote the other boundary point of @xmath35 by @xmath23 .",

    ", we want to have no endpoints between the two endpoints of @xmath35 , on the boundary of the disk . for this purpose",
    "we move @xmath22 towards @xmath23 , below some endpoints . at the same time",
    "@xmath36 moves towards @xmath37 above some other endpoints .",
    "this corresponds to several applications of @xmath39 move .",
    "secondly , we perform several @xmath34 moves to kill all the crossings between @xmath35 and other arcs .",
    "it is possible because @xmath35 is below all other arcs .",
    "finally , we can perform @xmath38 move on @xmath35 .",
    "now instead of @xmath29 , @xmath35 and @xmath40 we have a single part of arc , call it @xmath41 .",
    "it is unknotted and above all other arcs .",
    "there may be some self - crossings of @xmath41 and in that case we kill them with @xmath34 moves .",
    "@xmath30 is renamed @xmath42 .",
    "the arcs are now positioned in the following way : @xmath43    we can repeat the process with @xmath41 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as long as there are at least three arcs or parts of arcs left this is possible . finally we will end up with a single arc",
    ". it will be unknotted and we can kill all crossings again .",
    "thus it will be 0-homologous or non zero - homologous unknot .",
    "let @xmath19 be a diagram of a knot in @xmath10 . by making some crossing changes on it",
    ", we can obtain a diagram of the unknot .",
    "choose orientation and basepoint on @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the diagram obtained from @xmath19 by making the necessary crossing changes that make @xmath46 descending .",
    "then @xmath46 is a diagram of an unknot by theorem [ theorem_knots ] .    in the proof of theorem [ theorem_knots ]",
    ", there are two types of simplifications of the diagram .",
    "the first one is to make the arcs unknotted . in this case",
    "we use only @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 moves .",
    "the second is to eliminate some arcs . in this case",
    "we use only @xmath48 and @xmath49 moves that involve at least two different arcs as well as @xmath38 and @xmath39 moves . in the proof we alternated these two types of simplifications .",
    "another proof is possible in which any descending diagram is changed to a diagram with no crossings by a sequence of simplifications of the second type ( the number of arcs will be reduced to one ) , followed at the end by a simplification of the first type .    in the case of a diagram that is descending and which represents 0-homologous unknot ,",
    "consider the diagram with a single arc obtained after a sequence of simplifications of the second type defined in the previous remark .",
    "this diagram will be descending in the classical sense ( when we move an ascending arc through the boundary it becomes descending and vice versa ) . in this way",
    "we see that the notion of descending diagram in @xmath10 is similar to the same notion in @xmath0 even for some diagrams of non affine knots .",
    "there is no natural notion of unlink in @xmath10 .",
    "a link has two types of components : the 0-homologous and the non 0-homologous ones ( they will be called _ 1-homologous _ ) .",
    "for the first type there is no problem to see how they should look in an unlink : like in @xmath0 they should be unknots and each of them should be in a ball which does not intersect the other components . for the second type , different definitions of unlink are possible .",
    "note that two 1-homologous components will always intersect in a diagram . even if we require that an unlink should have a diagram in which any couple of 1-homologous components has a single common crossing and there are no other crossings , there are still many choices for an unlink .",
    "this is related to the configurations of skew lines in @xcite by o. ya .",
    "viro and j. v. drobotukhina .    in figure [ unlinks ]",
    ", the two links could be taken as unlink with three 1-homologous components and four 0-homologous .",
    "but in fact they are not isotopic .",
    "this suggests that one may define a _",
    "standard unlink_. we consider the following definition of standard unlink : take a projective line .",
    "add the next below the first slightly rotating it in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "the third will be under the two firsts , also rotated in the same direction .",
    "we continue in this way with all projective lines .    an equivalent way to obtain standard",
    "unlink is the following : take several complex lines in @xmath50 .",
    "they represent projective lines in @xmath10 which form the standard unlink .",
    "for instance in figure [ unlinks ] the first is standard unlink , but not the second .",
    "now the question arises : is it possible to unlink a link diagram ( obtain a diagram of a standard unlink ) by crossing changes ?",
    "the approach that was used in the case of knots does not extend directly .",
    "the problems arise from the 1-homologous components .",
    "recall that a diagrammatic component of @xmath19 is a part of @xmath19 coming from a component of the link .",
    "we will say that a diagrammatic component is _",
    "_ 1-homologous _ ) , if it comes from a 0-homologous ( resp .",
    "1-homologous ) component of the link .",
    "suppose that we have a diagram of a link , @xmath19 , with @xmath51 0-homologous diagrammatic components , @xmath52 , and some 1-homologous diagrammatic components .",
    "choose some basepoint and orientation for each 0-homologous diagrammatic component .    if we make @xmath53 descending , in the same way as it was done for knots ( its arcs will alternate below and above the other components ) , it will become diagram of an unknot , unlinked to the other components .",
    "we can continue with @xmath54 in the same way .",
    "the crossings between the 1-homologous diagrammatic components of @xmath19 were not changed , so the problem of unlinking a link diagram reduces to the problem of unlinking a diagram with only 1-homologous diagrammatic components .",
    "if we try to make the arcs of 1-homologous diagrammatic components of @xmath19 alternating in the similar way as for 0-homologous diagrammatic components , there will be a problem : after unknotting the first 1-homologous diagrammatic component it will lie below or above everything else and we will not be able to continue with the next one .",
    "for instance in figure [ bad_1 ] we can try to put the component with a single arc below or above the other component .",
    "but in either case the resulting diagram will not be a diagram of standard unlink .",
    "nonetheless , as was stated in the introduction , we will define a notion of descending diagram for arbitrary link diagrams . in order to do this ,",
    "we need to enhance the data which is used in the definition of descending diagram .    in the next section",
    "we will construct the data needed for the 1-homologous diagrammatic components ( different from the data needed for the 0-homologous diagrammatic components ) .",
    "for each such component a set of self - crossings will be specified .",
    "this set will determine some part of the diagram which will be called dashed part .",
    "we will also specify two antipodal endpoints of arcs on some part of the diagram that is not dashed .    with this data",
    "we define the notion of descending diagram .",
    "we prove that a descending diagram is a diagram of the standard unlink in two steps . in the first step the dashed part of the diagram",
    "is eliminated by a sequence of reidemeister moves .",
    "the remaining diagram has a simpler form and , in the second step , it is transformed into a canonical diagram of standard unlink by another sequence of reidemeister moves .",

    "we call the associated orientation _ the orientation determined by @xmath24_.    we will also dash the part of the diagram along which we travel from the upper branch to the lower branch of @xmath24 according to the orientation determined by @xmath24 . to be precise , we notice that we travel on the net of the diagram , but we can lift it to the diagram itself and dash in this way some part of it .",

    "\\2 ) for any two crossings @xmath56 in @xmath55 , the intersection between the dashed part determined by @xmath24 and the one determined by @xmath57 is empty or consists of some crossings ( the dashed parts are disjoint except possibly for some crossings ) .    to see that it is always possible to construct a simplifying set @xmath55 , we first define a partial order on the set of self - crossings of @xmath20 in a diagram @xmath19 :    @xmath58 if both branches of @xmath57 are in the dashed part determined by @xmath24 .",
