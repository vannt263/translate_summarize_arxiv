    "in the last 15 years , imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) have discovered more than 10 sources in tev energy range populating from pulsar nebula , supernova remnants , starburst galaxies , agns of bl lac type and even a newly found unidentified source @xcite , and it is remarkable that agns make up a large percentage of these sources . to understand the mechanism of the tev @xmath0-ray emissions from diversity of objects , and more fundamentally ,",
    "to understand the origin and acceleration of cosmic ray ( cr ) , it is important that the number of tev sources will be largely increased .",
    "however , to improve the statistics of tev sources is not a trivial task for iact due to its small field of view and low duty cycle , which particularly limit its power in detecting flare type sources and unknown sources .",
    "therefore , a complementary detecting technology is necessary . although their sensitivity for detecting dim @xmath0-ray sources is lower than that of the iact , extensive air shower ( eas ) experiments , such as the tibet air shower array @xcite and milagrito / milagro ( atkins et al . 1999 ; atkins et al .",
    "2003 ; atkins et al .",
    "2004 ) experiments , have resulted in successful observation of @xmath0-ray emissions from standard candle crab nebula and from transient sources such as mrk  501 and mrk  421 .",
    "their characteristic abilities in high duty cycle and large field of view allow them to simultaneously monitor a larger area in space over continuous time .",
    "most importantly , the eas technique can potentially provide useful information for iact observatories for their further dedicated observations .",
    "such follow - up observations have been performed by whipple experiment @xcite guided by the hot spots seen from tev @xmath0-ray all - sky survey results published by the tibet air shower array @xcite and milagro @xcite experiments .",
    "the satellite experiment egret on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) pioneered the all - sky @xmath0-ray survey in the energy range of 20 mev to 30 gev @xcite .",
    "the successful detection of the diffuse @xmath0-ray emissions from the galactic plane and a peak near 70 mev seen in a rather hard @xmath0-ray spectrum supported the supernova acceleration model , according to which tev @xmath0-ray emissions were also expected .",
    "in addition , egret discovered 271 @xmath0-ray point sources @xcite , among which about 100 were identified as snrs , agns , etc . , while the rest has remained unidentified . the diverse types of @xmath0-ray emissions , which included galactic sources and extragalactic sources , greatly improved our knowledge of both cr physics and astrophysics .",
    "the all - sky survey remains one of the major concerns for ground - based observatories ( weeks et al .",

    "for example , airobicc made a northern sky survey @xcite on @xmath0-ray emissions for energy above 15 tev ; because there was no compelling evidence for a signal source , an absolute flux upper limit between 4.2 and 8.8 crab was obtained for a declination ( decl . ) of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . with the iact technique , within the tev energy range",
    ", the hegra telescope was used to performe a survey @xcite in one quarter of the galactic plane in the longitude range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . as a result of negative evidence ,",
    "upper flux limits on each individual known point source located in this region were obtained between 0.15 crab and several crab .",
    "most recently , milagro updated its results @xcite in the northern sky survey in tev energy range , and pushed the average flux upper limit down to a level between 275 and 600 mcrab ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) above 1 tev for source decl . between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "as an independent experiment , the tibet air shower array has similar sensitivity , and covers almost the same energy ranges and field of view as those experiments do .",
    "the results from the tibet air shower array should therefore provide important information for crosschecking and confirmation .",
    "the tibet air shower array has been conducted at yangbajing ( @xmath9e , @xmath10n ; 4,300  m a.s.l ) in tibet , china since 1990 .",
    "the tibet i array @xcite , which consisted of 49 scintillation counters forming a @xmath11 matrix of 15  m span , was gradually expanded to the tibet ii array occupying an area of 36,900  m@xmath12 by increasing the number of counters from 1994 to 1996 .",
    "both tibet i and ii have the same mode energy ( the most probable gamma ray energy observed from the standard candle crab ) of 10 tev .",
    "in order to observe tev crs , in 1996 , part of the tibet ii array covering an area of 5,175  m@xmath12 was further upgraded to a high density ( hd ) array @xcite with 7.5 m span . soon after decreasing the mode energy to 3 tev , the hd array observed multi - tev @xmath0-ray signals from the crab nebula @xcite and mrk  501 @xcite . to increase the event rate , in 1999 , the hd array was enlarged to cover the center part of the tibet ii array as the tibet iii array @xcite .",
    "the area of tibet iii has reached to 22,050  m@xmath13 ( figure 1 ) .    as can be shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the tibet hd and tibet iii have identical structure except the array size and shape .",
    "each counter has a plastic scintillation plate ( bicron bc-408a ) of 0.5 m@xmath13 in area and 3 cm in thickness , and is equipped with a fast - timing ( ft ) photomultiplier tube ( pmt ; hamamatsu h1161 ) .",
    "a 0.5 cm thick lead plate is put on the top of each counter in order to increase the array sensitivity by converting @xmath0-rays into electron - positron pairs in the shower @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution of the hd and the tibet iii are about @xmath14 in the energy region above 3 tev , as estimated from full monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite and verified by the moon shadow measurement from observational data @xcite .",
    "the trigger rate is about 105 hz for the hd and 680 hz for the tibet iii . in this work ,",
    "the sample includes data obtained by running the hd array for 555.9 live days from feb .",
    "1997 to sept .",
    "1999 and the tibet iii array for 456.8 days from nov .",
    "1999 to oct . 2001 .",
    "the event selection was done by imposing the following four criteria on the reconstructed data : i ) each shower event should fire four or more fast - time ( ft ) detectors recording 1.25 or more particles ; ii ) the estimated shower center location should be inside the array ; iii ) the sum of the number of particles per m@xmath12 detected in each detector @xmath15 should be larger than @xmath16 ; iv ) the zenith angle of the incident direction should be less than @xmath17 . after applying these cuts and a data quality cut , about 40% of the shower events",
    "were selected , results in a total number of events to be about @xmath18 .",
    "because the tibet air shower array can not distinguish a @xmath0-ray induced shower event from the overwhelming cr background shower events , when tracing and counting the number of events in an `` on - source window '' centered at a candidate point source direction with a size at the level of angular resolution , the number of background events must be estimated from the observational data recorded in the side band , which is usually referred to as `` off - source window '' .",
    "sitting on an almost horizontal plane , the tibet hd and iii have almost azimuth - independent efficiency in receiving the shower events for any given zenith angle .",
    "the equi - zenith angle method was therefore developed . in brief , simultaneously collected shower events in the same zenith angle belt can be used to construct the `` off - source windows '' and to estimate the background for a candidate point source located in the same zenith angle .",
    "this method can eliminate various detecting effects caused by instrumental and environmental variations , such as changes in pressure and temperature which are hard to be controlled and intend to introduce systematic error in measurement .",
    "in reality , the actual azimuth angle distribution deviates from a uniform one mainly due to the fact that the tibet hd and iii arrays are situated on a slope of about @xmath19 from the southeast to the northwest .",
    "furthermore , a geomagnetic effect in the northern hemisphere causes unequal efficiency between north and south @xcite .",
    "together with other possible unknown effects , all the steady effects lead to an approximately @xmath20 higher event rate from the southerly direction than from the northerly direction .",
    "this non - uniformity must be properly accounted for in the following analyses .    for the purpose of crosschecking ,",
    "two independently developed analyses based on the equi - zenith angle method are used in this work .",
    "one is dedicated to a point source search , while the other in addition is sensitive to large - scale anisotropy of the intensity of the cr .",
    "a mc study was used to carefully compare the two methods , and the search sensitivities were found to be very comparable . however , the number of the background events estimated by the two methods is different due to the different ways used in choosing the off - source windows ( see subsections below in detail ) . as a result ,",
    "significance values calculated from the two methods differ by about 0.5 @xmath21 statistically .      as a good approximation",
    ", the large - scale anisotropy of the cr intensity can be neglected if the `` off - source windows '' are chosen to be close enough in distance to the `` on - source window '' , since the cr intensity only changes slowly in the sky . in this analysis , to make sure not to miss any possible unknown source , the surveyed sky has been over - sampled by the following way : the sky is divided into @xmath22 cells , from @xmath1 to @xmath23 in right ascension ( r.a . ) and from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in decl . pointing to the center of those cells , cones with a half opening angle of @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 tev ) or @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 tev )",
    "are tested as on - source windows .",
    "these cone sizes are chosen to maximize the source search sensitivity @xcite .",
    "10 off - source windows of the same shape are symmetrically aligned on both sides of the on - source window , at a zenith angle - dependent step size in order to maintain an angular distance of @xmath28 between the neighboring off - source windows . in order to avoid signal events related to an on - source window being wrongly counted as a background event ,",
    "the two off - source windows closest in distance to the on - source window are required to be placed at twice of the step - size from the center of the on - source window . denoting the number of events in on - source window as @xmath29 , and the number of events in the @xmath30th off - source window as @xmath31 , without considering the effect from non - uniform azimuth angle distribution",
    ", the number of background events can be estimated as @xmath32 when the zenith angle is less than @xmath33 , the 10 off - source windows defined above become to be overlapped .",
    "therefore , data obtained with a zenith angle less than @xmath33 are not used . since the azimuth angle distribution is not completely flat as discussed earlier , the averaged number of events from off - source windows , @xmath34 , as calculated in equation ( 1 ) is not an exact description of the background number in the on - source window .",
    "therefore @xmath34 needs to be corrected .",
    "giving the fact that azimuth angle distribution remains stable over a period of time that is much longer than the time scale of a day , the effect of the tiny violation of the exact equi - zenith angle condition can thus be determined from the observational data which were taken only a few hours apart from the exposure of the on ( off)-source window(s ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the previous measurement is repeated 35 times ( the relevant `` on '' and `` off '' source windows are hereafter called `` dummy on '' and `` dummy off '' source windows ) . together with the on - source window , 35 dummy on - source windows on the orbit which has the same decl . as the on - source window are defined at regular intervals along r.a .",
    "direction , i.e. , the dummy on - source windows are located at @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the r.a .",
    "location of the on - source window , and @xmath37 an index of the repeated measurements which runs from 1 to 35 .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the number of events in the dummy on - source window and its estimated background from the @xmath37th measurement , respectively .",
    "the correction factor , @xmath40 , due to non - uniform azimuth angle distribution is given by @xmath41 as for the tibet observation , @xmath40 deviates from 1 at an order of @xmath42 depending on the decl . of the on - source window .",
    "finally , the corrected estimation of the number of background events is obtained as    @xmath43    it is clear that such a correction is free from the systematic uncertainty due to the slow variation of instrumental and environmental effects . denoting the number of excess events in an on - source window as @xmath44 , its uncertainty , @xmath45 , is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is well approximated by @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is propagated from the statistic error of @xmath40 and @xmath50 , according to equation ( 3 ) , @xmath51 . considering the number of off - source window and dummy on(off)-source window , it is not difficult to calculate @xmath49 as @xmath52=0.1314{n_{\\rm { bg}}^{*}}$ ]",
    ". then we obtain @xmath53 . because both @xmath29 and @xmath54 are statistically large numbers , the significance value can be simply calculated as @xmath55      unlike the method described in the previous sub section , this method attempts to exploit the statistics as much as possible from two approaches .",
    "first , shapes of non - uniformly distributed azimuth angle distribution from whole data set are used to do the azimuth correction . to be more precise , after event selection , for each @xmath56 zenith angle interval between @xmath1 to @xmath57 ,",
    "azimuth angle distributions are filled and normalized , so that the averaged function value is one . inversing the function and using it as an event weight would keep the total number of events unchanged but make the azimuth angle distribution flat .",
    "second , all events in the equi - zenith angle belt except those inside the on - source window are taken as off - source events . in this case the large - scale anisotropy effect can no longer be ignored , which leads to the attempt to fit simultaneously the relative cr intensity over the sky within the detector s field of view .",
    "the idea of this method is that at any moment , for all directions , if we scale down ( or up ) the number of observed events by dividing them with their relative cr intensity , then statistically , those scaled observed number of events in a zenith angle belt should be equal anywhere . a @xmath58 function can be built accordingly and the relative intensity of crs in each direction can be solved by minimizing the @xmath58 function .",
    "as in the previous method , the celestial space from 0@xmath59 to 360@xmath59 in r.a . and from 0@xmath59 to 60@xmath59 in decl .",
    "are binned into cells with a bin size of 0.1@xmath59 in both the r.a . and decl",
    ". directions . in the observer",
    "s coordinates , the zenith angle @xmath60 is divided from 0@xmath59 to 40@xmath59 by a step size of 0.08@xmath59 , and the azimuth angle @xmath61 is binned by a zenith angle dependent bin width ( 0.08@xmath59/ sin(@xmath60 ) ) .",
    "for every local sidereal time ( lst ) interval bin ( 24s ) @xmath62 , a cell in ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) space @xmath63 is mapped to a celestial cell @xmath64 , i.e. r.a .",
    "bin @xmath30 and decl .",
    "bin @xmath37 , through two discrete coordinate transformation functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , at a certain lst bin @xmath62 , the number of events accumulated in zenith angle bin @xmath67 and azimuth angle bin @xmath68 is directly related to the cr intensity @xmath69 in cell @xmath70 of celestial space .    denoting the number of observed events after azimuth angle correction as @xmath71 , and the relative intensity of cr as @xmath72(i , j ) , the equi - zenith angle condition leads to the following @xmath58 function : @xmath73 ^ 2 } { \\ ; n_{\\rm { obs}}(m,\\,n,\\,l)\\;\\big/\\;{i^2(i,\\ : j)}\\,+\\ , { \\sum_{\\,l'\\neq \\,l}\\big ( n_{\\rm { obs}}(m,\\,n,\\,l')\\;/\\;i^2(i',\\ : j')}\\big)\\,\\big/\\,({\\sum_{\\,l'\\neq \\,l } 1})^2 } \\,\\ ] ] + here , @xmath70 is mapped from @xmath74 by the above - mentioned transformation functions .    from equation",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath75 and its error @xmath76 can be solved numerically by the iteration method . as the dimensionless variable @xmath69 is only a relative quantity , and because the detecting efficiency along the decl .",
    "direction can not be absolutely calibrated , we apply the constraint that averaged @xmath69 in each decl .",
    "slices is equal to one .    on the other hand , @xmath77 ,",
    "the number of observed events in the celestial cell @xmath70 is simply a summation of the relevant number of events counted in local coordinates @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath78 .    as the relative intensity of the cr contains the contribution from large - scale anisotropy of the cr , to remove this effect and to isolate the contribution from point sources , the measured cr intensity in a @xmath79 belt along decl .",
    "is projected to the r.a .",
    "direction , in @xmath80 bin size .",
    "the center of the belts moves from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , in @xmath56 step size . by smoothing those curves and subtracting them from the corresponding belt of @xmath56 width",
    ", we obtain a cr intensity , @xmath81 , that is corrected for the anisotropy effect .    with this corrected cr intensity",
    ", the number of excess events and their uncertainties in cell @xmath70 can be calculated as @xmath82 @xmath83    taking into account the array s angular resolution , events are summed up from a cone with an axis pointing to the source direction , and the half opening angle is set as @xmath24 ( for @xmath84 tev ) or @xmath26 ( for @xmath85 tev ) . all celestial cells with their centers located inside the cone contribute to the number of events as well as its uncertainty .",
    "finally , the significance for an on - source window centered at cell @xmath70 can be calculated as    @xmath86",
    "the significance distributions from all directions are shown in figure 2a and figure 2b for the two analysis methods , respectively . in the case of method ii , the large - scale anisotropy must be measured and subtracted , the systematic uncertainty to the significance value due to this subtraction procedure is estimated to be 0.2 @xmath21 by changing the bin size and the smoothing parameters .",
    "figure 3 shows the intensity map containing the contribution from the large - scale anisotropy with a demonstration of its subtraction .",
    "the excellent agreement on the negative side with a normal distribution ( figure 2a , figure 2b ) indicates that the systematic effects are well under control for both analyses . as for the positive side ,",
    "a wider shoulder exists with significance values greater than 4.0 @xmath21 .",
    "the dominant contributions are due to the stable @xmath0-ray source crab and transient source mrk  421 which was in an active state from feb .",
    "2000 through oct .",
    "2001 @xcite .",
    "after removing their contributions , in such a manner that those cells that are less than 2@xmath59 distance from the two sources are excluded , the dot - dashed histograms in figure 2a and figure 2b which show the significance distribution from the rest of the cells agree much better with a normal distribution . for reference",
    ", the table 1 lists the directions of local maximal significance points with significance values greater than 4.5 @xmath21 from either of the two methods , and those prominent directions contribute to the remaining small shoulder in figure 2a and figure 2b .    each significance value listed in table 1",
    "is calculated by equation ( 4 ) and ( 8) which is supposed to be used for a predefined on - source window . however , none of our prominent directions comes from a predefined one , as described in section 3.1 , a large number of overlapping on - source windows have been tried . in comparison with finding a high significance value from one predefined direction ( e.g. , crab or mrk421 )",
    ", such a procedure makes the probability being larger by a factor of about the number of trials , and therefore making the excess of on - source event number less significant .",
    "it should be mentioned that it is very difficult to count the number of trials exactly . to have order of magnitude estimation on the lower boundary of the number of trials",
    ", we can divide the solid angle of surveyed sky by the solid angle of one on source window , and get a number of about 7000 which still under estimates the number of trials . as an example , for the first prominent point in table.1 , the significance value is 5.3 @xmath21 from method i(4.8 @xmath21 from method ii ) , enlarge the probability by 7000 to account the number of trials effect end up with only 3.3(2.5 ) @xmath21 in significance . to distinguish this significance from the previously calculated one , we call",
    "the former calculated one the pre - trials significance ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this number of trials effect can also be understood from another point of view as the following : not including the crab and mrk421 , both methods observe four directions which have @xmath87 greater than 4.5@xmath21 . from pure background mc simulation ,",
    "the probability to observe four or more such directions is equivalent to a fluctuation of only 1.4@xmath21 . in conclusion , after taking into account the number of trials effect , the existence of the high significance point in table 1 is well consistent with the background fluctuation .",
    "as can be seen in table 1 , two established sources crab and mrk  421 are detected in an angular distance not larger than @xmath88 from their nominal positions , in agree with the @xmath26 positional uncertainty estimated for the both methods .",
    "one of our previously reported @xcite hot point with pre - trials significance value of 4.0 @xmath21 located at ( @xmath89 ) is not listed in table 1 , because its pre - trials significance value is not improved after we further include more data samples into this analysis which increase the number of events by 60% : @xmath90 @xmath21 from method i and @xmath91 @xmath21 from method ii .",
    "the interesting thing about this point is that it is close to the cygnus arm and was found to be close to one of milargo hot points @xcite , though the large angular distance of @xmath92 indicates that the coincidence is not in favour of a point source hypothesis .",
    "conclusive results will rely on further more observation . as a cross - check , milagro hot point at ( @xmath93 ) @xcite",
    "is investigated in this work : the maximum pre - trials significant point is found at ( @xmath94 ) with @xmath95 @xmath21 from method i , and ( @xmath96 ) with @xmath97 @xmath21 from method ii . in another word ,",
    "no strong confirmation was obtained . on the other hand , except the agreement measurement with comparable sensitivity on crab and mrk  421 from both observatories , no significant prominent direction from this work matches with milagro hot points @xcite within the allowed source positional uncertainties .",
    "when not considering the crab and mrk  421 , we think the marginal coincidence and refutation of other hot points between tibet air shower and milagro could be attributed to the limited statistics and sensitivity of the two experiments .",
    "whether these hot points are just due to statistical fluctuation or due to new tev gamma sources will become clearer with the future improved statistic of observational data .",
    "as described previously , the significances from all other directions other than crab and mrk  421 are not high enough to definitely claim any existence of new tev @xmath0-ray point source , we set a 90@xmath98 confidence level ( cl ) upper flux limit for all directions in the sky , except at the positions of crab and mrk  421 .",
    "the upper limit on the number of events at the 90% cl is calculated firstly according to the number of excess events and its uncertainty for each cell following the statistic method given by helene @xcite .",
