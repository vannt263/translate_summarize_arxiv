    "in recent years , the annihilation - diffusion problem has generated significant interest , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "the annihilation - diffusion problem usually corresponds to that of the kinetics of particle density decay in the annihilation reaction @xmath1 ( one - species annihilation ) and @xmath2 ( two - species annihilation ) . in the latter case , in most physical systems that one is interested in , in addition to the thermal diffusion and kinetic annihilation ,",
    "the particles a and b are charged and interact via a power - law long - range interaction ( lri ) , usually of coulomb type , although here we will consider a more general lri .",
    "such physically important interaction can clearly strongly influence the annihilation dynamics by introducing an additional time scale in the annihilation process , and can lead to a new mechanism for slow dynamics .",
    "the two - species annihilation reaction with lri can be studied in a variety of experiments .",
    "a thermal quench of a freely - suspended liquid crystal film from smectic - a to smectic - c phase @xcite is one experimental system where this annihilation process has been studied in great detail . in such experiments , immediately after quench , the singularities of the smectic director ( 2d vector ) field appear as positive and negative vortices interacting ( due to elastic forces ) via a logarithmic potential . as time elapses , vortices of opposite sign slowly annihilate , exhibiting complex dynamics that is clearly and strongly influenced by temperature , initial particle distribution , and lri that leads to an attraction between annihilating partners .",
    "similar annihilation problems also appear in turbulent flow , superconductivity , spinodal decomposition , and many other condensed matter systems .",
    "the annihilation process is also relevant to coarsening of topological defects produced by symmetry breaking field in particle physics models , after an early temperature quench due to the fast initial universe expansion , a process that is thought in part to determine the large scale structure of today s",
    "universe.@xcite    it is well known that in classical chemical kinetics , density decay for both one - species and two - species annihilation is described by the kinetic rate - equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ): @xmath3 with the large-@xmath4 asymptotics given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a reaction constant . equation ( [ eq : kinrate ] ) completely neglects all spatial fluctuations and correlations of the particle density .",
    "although the dynamics described by equations  ( [ eq : kinrate ] ) - ( [ eq : mfsoln ] ) is correct above an upper critical space dimension @xmath7 , for @xmath8 , both diffusion and fluctuations play an important role , substantially slowing down the density decay .",
    "it was indeed shown  @xcite , that for the one - species annihilation without lri , the @xmath9 .",
    "that is , for systems of dimensionality less than @xmath10 , the density decay is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is diffusion constant and @xmath13 is the initial particle density .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : difsolnaa ] ) can be understood either by invoking a single length scaling arguments  @xcite or by using a more elaborate smoluchowski approach  @xcite .",
    "for the two - species case , it was shown ( refs.@xcite , @xcite ) that the upper critical dimension @xmath14 , and that for @xmath15 , the large-@xmath4 asymptotics is : @xmath16 the decay law  ( [ eq : difsolnab ] ) was confirmed in several numerical simulations of one- , two- , and three - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in order to observe such power - law decay , it is necessary initially to have an equal number of positive and negative charges , distributed at random .",
    "if initial numbers of positive and negative charges are different , one should observe an exponential density decay to the non - vacuum equilibrium ( see , e.g. , sokolov et al .",
    "if the system is well - stirred , i.e. , long - wavelength fluctuations of charge density are suppressed , the decay law would also be different .",
    "we will not consider such cases in this paper .",
    "to better study the role of correlations in reactions without lri , description in terms of secondary quantization operators of creation and annihilation was proposed .",
    "@xcite further developing this approach , peliti  @xcite proposed an `` exact '' ( valid to all orders in perturbation expansion ) renormalization - group theory for the one - species annihilation , and lee and cardy  @xcite suggested a similar approach to the two - species annihilation , both based on the rigorous master equation converted into a field - theoretic formulation . in the latter case , it was shown that the decay law  ( [ eq : difsolnab ] ) is an asymptotic one for large @xmath4 and small @xmath13 .",
    "it was also rigorously proven that the assumptions used in the derivation of equation  ( [ eq : difsolnab ] ) are correct only for @xmath17 , while for @xmath18 , a more elaborate renormalization group procedure which includes an effective noise with nontrivial correlations should be carried out .",
    "the addition of the lri further complicates the picture .",
    "equations of motion become strongly coupled via the nonlocal interaction , and only approximate solutions of these equations can be found .",
    "up to date , only coulombic  @xcite systems in two dimensions ( @xmath19 , the case corresponding to particles interacting via a logarithmic potential on a two - dimensional substrate or film ) were studied numerically  @xcite , and results appear to be inconclusive . in these simulations , particle density exhibited a power - law decay @xmath20 with the exponent @xmath21 varying from @xmath22  @xcite to @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the authors proposed a scaling theory  @xcite suggesting that for a coulombic ( @xmath24 ) two - dimensional diffusion - annihilation system , annihilation exponent is equal to @xmath25 - close to but less than the mean - field exponent @xmath26 .",
    "oshanin et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the exponent should be exactly 1 ; ispolatov and krapivsky  @xcite came to the same conclusion using an `` inpenetrable domain '' scaling theory . in their theoretical and computational study of the defect annihilation in two - dimensional xy - model , yurke et al .",
    "@xcite argued that annihilation exponent is 1 , with logarithmic correction due to the logarithmic dependence of the mobility on the defect size .",
    "thus , the problem of annihilation behavior for coulombic system in two dimensions has not been completely resolved , although it seems rather plausible that the final asymptotics is governed by a classical exponent 1 , with possible logarithmic correction .",
    "it seems to be certain , however , that annihilation in three - dimensional coulombic system has a mean - field type final asymptotics with exponent 1 .",
    "finally , we should point out that until recently , there has been no discussion of lri other than coulombic . recently .",
    "several scaling theories have been suggested to analyze arbitrary power - law interaction ( more short - ranged than coulombic )  @xcite.such problems may arise , e.g. , in describing interactions between vacancies and interstitials in a two- or three - dimensional crystal .    in this paper , we propose a self - consistent theory based on coarse - grained hydrodynamic equations of motion for particle number density and charge density fields .",
    "this theory allows us to systematically calculate the dependence of the density decay law on initial conditions and to investigate the role of lri .",
    "it can be shown@xcite that the self - consistent approximation that we employ here is equivalent to a resummation of an infinite class of feynman graphs which take into account the conserved charge density fluctuations but ignore the less important nonconserved number density fluctuations .",
    "this approximation can be further systematically improved by the use of perturbation theory and the renormalization group analysis that will be a subject of future publication.@xcite in the limit of weak long - range interactions , this approach agrees well with the known theoretical results ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) for the two - species annihilation @xmath27 , thereby further clarifying the underlying assumptions that led to these results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : eqns ] we define all variables and present the equations of motion on which our analysis and results will be based . in section  [ sec : solns ]",
    "the self - consistent approximation is described and the asymptotic solutions are obtained and analyzed . finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we analyze the resulting phase diagram and discuss it in the context of the previously obtained results for various diffusion - annihilation systems , which are selected points on our phase diagram .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of two kinds of particles , a and b , with a having a positive charge @xmath28 and b having a negative charge @xmath29 .",
    "we label their , time- and position - dependent concentrations as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and impose the condition that @xmath32 .",
    "the equation of motion for the densities is based on the generalized law of mass conservation , violated by the annihilation process , @xmath33 where the mass current is given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the electrostatic long - range potential at a point * r * at time @xmath4 due to local charge fluctuations away from neutrality ; @xmath36 is the power exponent of the long - range force , @xmath37 is particle mobility taken to be a constant , and @xmath38 is particle charge .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : evol ] ) - ( [ eq : poten ] ) should be solved in conjunction with initial conditions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . since here",
    "we are interested in statistical averages , rather than in a dynamic solution for a given system with specific initial conditions , we will focus on the density correlation functions , with averages over random @xmath41 initial conditions .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : evol ] ) - ( [ eq : poten ] ) represent the coarse - grained continuum limit for the `` real '' equations of motion ; all variables in these equations are averaged over `` elementary volume '' @xmath42 .",
    "thus , only long - wavelength modes are actually described by these equations , and , therefore , only intermediate - time and large - time regimes can be analyzed .",
    "it is more natural and convenient to describe the system in terms of the particle number and charge densities .",
    "we denote the former one as @xmath43 , and the latter one as @xmath44 and relate them to densities @xmath45 and @xmath46 as follows : @xmath47 @xmath48 rewriting equations  ( [ eq : evol ] ) - ( [ eq : poten ] ) using densities @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we obtain : @xmath51 where @xmath52 .    in the absence of lri , equations  ( [ eq : rhoevol ] ) - ( [ eq : fevol ] )",
    "are those analyzed in ref .",
    "however , the presence of the additional long - range interactions , makes the analysis of their asymptotic solutions rather nontrivial and , as we will show below , leads to new dynamic regimes .",
    "it is important to note that equations  ( [ eq : rhoevol ] ) - ( [ eq : fevol ] ) do not contain noise terms in their right - hand sides .",
    "it has been rigorously shown that such noise terms represent important correlations and in some cases may even become predominant in determining the asymptotic decay rate . in equations of motion describing a near - equilibrium dynamics , powerful fluctuation - dissipation theorem determines the form of noise correlations .",
    "in contrast , in systems far from equilibrium , such as a system of annihilating particles , it can be shown@xcite that the effective hydrodynamic equations of motion derived from the fundametal master equations contain noise terms with very nontrivial correlations , of the form which could not be easily guessed a priori .",
    "lee and cardy @xcite proved that in a two - species reaction without lri , such noise leads only to the renormalization of the reaction rate @xmath6 , but not to the change of the scaling exponents , provided that space dimensionality @xmath53 .",
    "we have shown , in a similar fashion @xcite , that for systems with lri , the noise has no effect on the asymptotic dynamics for @xmath53 , if the renormalization of both @xmath6 and @xmath54 is implied .",
    "in addition , since equations  ( [ eq : rhoevol ] ) - ( [ eq : fevol ] ) provide a coarse - grained description on the length scale larger than the interparticle spacing @xmath55 , the kinetic coefficients , e.g. @xmath6 , are effective coefficients that incorporate finite renormalization due to the correlations on short length scales .    in order to simplify further analysis , we divide each of the equations  ( [ eq : rhoevol ] ) -([eq : fevol ] ) by @xmath13 and transform everything to dimensionless variables as follows :    / _ 0 , f f / _ 0 , d d ( _ 0)^2/d ,     + @xmath56    it is important to notice that equation  ( [ eq : fevol ] ) is linear with respect to @xmath49 , while equation  ( [ eq : rhoevol ] ) is quadratic with respect to @xmath49 ( this points to the system s invariance with respect to the simultaneous charge sign reversal for all particles ) . in the next section , we will describe the self - consistent approximation and its solutions .",
    "we now make an important approximation in order to further simplify the analytical treatment of equations  ( [ eq : rhoevol])-([eq : fevol ] ) , namely , we choose to ignore the fluctuations of the particle density @xmath50 and concentrate on the fluctuations of the conserved charge density @xmath49 .",
    "this assumption is somewhat similar in spirit to the approach of glotzer and coniglio  @xcite for the problem of spinodal decomposition , and to the spherical approximation for the ising model in the limit of @xmath57 . unlike the `` classical '' mean - field approach",
    ", however , the proposed approximation does take into account exactly the charge density fluctuations , and is expected , therefore , to describe at least some of the features of the fluctuation - dominated kinetics .",
    "the justification of the proposed assumption lies in a simple observation that , while average particle density at any time is nonzero , so that @xmath58 is finite and likely to be small , average charge density is always zero , and therefore in comparison the charge fluctuations @xmath59 are large .",
    "thus , we expect the former fluctuations to be less important that the latter , and that we can approximate the particle number density by its average ( time - dependent ) value in the equations of motion without losing their important features . in a sense ,",
    "our approximation is a generalization of an argument used by toussaint and wilczek  @xcite , in which they based their scaling decay law on a suggestion that @xmath60 .",
    "it seems clear that the approximation of ignoring the number density fluctuations must breakdown at least below some upper - critical dimension @xmath7 , since asymptotically @xmath50 vanishes . in this case",
    "our approximation will be valid for @xmath61 for all times and in systems below @xmath7 it will be a good approximation up to a crossover time beyond which the asymptotics will be modified by the number density fluctuations . systematically taking into account these additional fluctuations",
    "will be a subject of future work.@xcite    taking into account the above approximation , we rewrite the equation  ( [ eq : fevol ] ) in fourier representation , taking @xmath62 as a spatially - independent but time - dependent function : @xmath63 where @xmath64 .    the equation  ( [ eq : rhoevol ] ) in this self - consistent approximation is rewritten as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes averaging over initial conditions .",
    "these equations of motion have to be supplemented with initial conditions .",
    "it is well known that the initial density distribution plays an important role in determining the scaling decay law .",
    "although the self - consistent approximation employed here is well suited for a comprehensive study of the influence of initial conditions on the dynamics , here we limit our study to a single type of an initial condition . throughout this paper",
    "we will focus on the dynamics initiated with a random gaussian particle distribution , completely characterized by @xmath67 which constraints the system to charge neutrality at all times and for simplicity we take the variance @xmath68 ( @xmath69 in physical units ) . for most charged experimental systems",
    "a more relevant initial conditions incorporate the suppression of long - wavelength fluctuations in charge density , which can be modeled ( within e.g. the debye - hckel approximation ) by @xmath70 in equation  ( [ eq : fkinit ] ) .",
    "the diffusion - only ( do ) case ( @xmath71 ) and coulombic case ( @xmath72 ) are the simplest systems with a relatively clear , yet interesting asymptotic behavior .",
    "all the intermediate interactions ( arbitrary @xmath36 and @xmath73 ) lead to a more complicated scaling behavior , with several regimes and crossovers .",
    "we will devote a subsection to each of these three cases .",
    "there are two ways of approaching the limit of `` no long - range interactions '' : by decreasing the force constant @xmath54 to 0 or by increasing the power exponent @xmath36 to infinity ( interaction with an effectively vanishing range )",
    ". obviously , these limits should give the same answer .",
    "for simplicity , we will set @xmath74 and show that our self - consistent approximation yields the well - known results.@xcite-@xcite @xmath75 for @xmath71 , the kinetic equation for @xmath49 reduces to a simple diffusion equation , with the solution @xmath76 substituting this solution  ( [ eq : twfk ] ) for @xmath77 into equation   ( [ eq : rhonewevol ] ) , and taking into account the initial condition  ( [ eq : f1kinit ] ) - ( [ eq : fkinit ] ) , we obtain : @xmath78 an the exact solution expressible in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions is possible.@xcite it can also be easily shown that equation  ( [ eq : twsoln ] ) describes the asymptotic solution of equation  ( [ eq : twequation ] ) .",
    "this is expected , since , as we argued above , the approximations made by toussaint and wilczek  @xcite are very similar to our self - consistent model .",
    "the case of @xmath79 will be analyzed in subsection  [ intermediate systems ] , where it will be shown that for all @xmath80 , the decay law is asymptotically the same as for do systems .      in coulombic systems ,",
    "the long - range interaction is the strongest possible that one can achieve without making the system thermodynamically unstable ( systems with interactions stronger than coulombic have infinite pressure and chemical potential even if their total charge is zero ) .",
    "because of this , one would expect the particle density decay for coulombic systems to be very close or equal to the mean - field law @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite as we describe below , the self - consistent approximation predicts the decay exponent @xmath26 consistent with this expectation and with some simulations reported in the literature.@xcite however , it can be shown@xcite that correction to this mean - field like decay law can arise from the number density fluctuations and noise for @xmath82 , both of which have been neglected in the self - consistent theory presented here .",

    "we obtain :    power(lhs ) = @xmath90 ;    power(rhs ) = @xmath91 .",
    "+ obviously , for the mean - field solution to be valid asymptotically , the power(lhs ) should be larger than the power(rhs ) , which happens for systems with dimensionality larger than the critical dimension , @xmath92 if @xmath93 , the asymptotic kinetics is determined by the slower process , which is the annihilation , with possibly interaction renormalized @xmath94 ( implicitely assumed here ) , and the coulomb interaction and diffusion are asymptotically irrelevant . for @xmath95 ,",

    "if diffusion is faster than the deterministic coulomb interaction - driven relaxation , i.e. , @xmath108 , then for times less than @xmath109 , the annihilation is governed by the intermediate asymptotics : @xmath110 so the particle density is described by the toussaint - wilczek solution up to the crossover time @xmath107 : @xmath111 this intermediate asymptotics , which exists only for @xmath112 , reflects early times diffusion - dominated decay , with the slower deterministic coulomb interaction driven classical @xmath113 decay appearing only at times later than @xmath107 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath114 or if @xmath115 , there is no extended intermediate regime and one should see a quick transition to a classical decay law .",
    "although within the self - consistent approximation the asymptotic @xmath116 decay is not affected by the choice of reasonable initial conditions , the intermediate diffusion - dominated decay is certainly affected by our choice of random gaussian uncorrelated initial conditions given in equation  ( [ eq : fkinit ] ) .",

    ", we proposed a new self - consistent method of calculating the average particle density as function of time . since the total particle density is a nonconserved order parameter with positive average at all times",
    ", we argued that its fluctuations are less important in determining dynamics of annihilation than that of a conserved order parameter - the charge density . this approximation self - consistently decouples two kinetic equations and make it possible to find the asymptotic solutions .      for coulombic systems in more than two dimensions , our model yields the mean - field exponent @xmath26 , yet the role of segregation ( i.e. , charge density fluctuations ) is important and can not be simply left out .",

    "the analysis of the self - consistent equations of motion  ( [ eq : fkevol ] ) - ( [ eq : rhonewevol ] ) suggests that there is a new region in the ( n , d ) phase diagram ( the region labeled ir in figure 1 ) , in which the large - t asymptotics of the density decay is determined by long - range forces .",

    "the self - consistent theory also predicts a crossover from diffusion - dominated decay to the lri - dominated decay at large times for the systems in this region .    because the self - consistent model is a semi - mean - field approximation ( it completely neglects particle density fluctuations and only takes into account the concerved charge density fluctuations ) ,",
    "it should be considered only as a first step .",
    "a systematic perturbative analysis of equations  ( [ eq : rhoevol ] ) - ( [ eq : fevol ] ) around our self - consistent solution is needed to assess the role of left out number density fluctuations and noise.@xcite    the proposed self - consistent model , its somewhat uncontrolled approximations notwithstanding , represents an important tool in qualitative analysis of dynamic processes in two - component systems with one conserved and one non - conserved variable .",
    "it predicts new annihilation behavior ( ir regime ) and new crossovers between diffusion - driven and lri - driven decay regions , reproduces all known results for the annihilation problem in special limits , and can be used to systematically study the role of initial conditions in such processes .                                            by coulombic ,",
