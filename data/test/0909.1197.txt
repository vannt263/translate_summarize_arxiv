    "non - critical string theory @xcite provides a simple and tractable toy model to understand various aspects of string theory .",

    "this realizes a non - perturbative definition of string theory @xcite and provides an explicit example of gauge / string duality @xcite .",
    "recently , our knowledge about the duality in non - critical string theory has extended to various kind of string theories .",
    "the first non - trivial extension was to the correspondence between the two - cut matrix models @xcite and type 0 superstring theory @xcite ; later , the multi - cut matrix models @xcite were proposed as a description of fractional superstring theory @xcite . despite of many qualitative discussions ,",
    "little is known quantitatively about the nature of multi - cut matrix models .",
    "therefore , in this paper we try to give explicit answers to the following questions : how do critical points and potentials look like and what is the corresponding geometry appearing at the vicinity of critical points ?    to address these issues , _ macroscopic loop amplitudes _",

    "\\label{introresolvent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] geometrically , the macroscopic loop amplitudes describe the probability amplitudes for creating holes on the two - dimensional surface as induced from the feynman graph of matrix integral .",
    "analytically , we can view the macroscopic loop amplitudes as a generating function for correlation functions of local operators ( in @xmath10 ) in the matrix models .",
    "most importantly , it enables us to probe eigenvalue distribution of a matrix @xmath10 @xcite and spacetime geometry in the weak coupling region @xcite .",
    "thus , the macroscopic loop amplitude is of fundamental importance in the theory of matrix models . in order to calculate the macroscopic loop amplitudes ,",
    "one powerful way is to use the method of orthogonal polynomials @xcite . through a useful identity ( see appendix [ relationresolventorthpoly ] ) , we can express the resolvent @xmath11 and the spectral parameter @xmath12 as a pair of conjugate variables acting on the space of orthogonal polynomials , whose commutations relation gives rise to the douglas ( string ) equation . in terms of the differential operators ,",
    "the string equation turns into a differential equation on the macroscopic loop amplitudes and we can solve it without directly evaluating the matrix integral ( [ introresolvent ] ) .",
    "right at the critical points , the resolvent has specific critical behavior .",
    "conversely , with some proper choice of the critical resolvent , one can obtain the critical potentials .",
    "in the two - matrix - model cases , this approach is especially useful for finding critical points @xcite and has been explicitly formulated for general @xmath13 critical points @xcite . along this line",
    ", we explicitly construct the critical points and potentials in the multi - cut two - matrix models .",
    "our results provide further insight into the understanding of the relationship @xcite between the existence of critical points and the the choice of hermiticity of critical potentials .",
    "macroscopic loop amplitudes at the vicinity of critical points ( i.e. with perturbation of the cosmological constant ) have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the seminal formula for general @xmath13 critical points with cosmological constant @xmath14 was first found by kostov @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath15 with @xmath16 , _ the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind _ , and @xmath17 . in the case of @xmath18",
    "minimal superstring theory ,- cut cases , there are two kinds of indexes : @xmath13 and @xmath18 .",

    "this general formula has been utilized in various studies of @xmath13 ( or @xmath18 ) critical points @xcite , even in the d - instanton effects of the string theory @xcite . moreover , in comparison with worldsheet cft , e.g.  with the fzzt - brane or zz - brane amplitudes in liouville theory @xcite , it is essentially the above formula which is realized in the calculation of @xmath13 ( or @xmath18 ) minimal ( super)string theory @xcite .",
    "one of the significances of this formula is that it provides us further checks of the string duality ( e.g. matching of correlators ) beyond matching of operator contents and critical exponents . since this comparison is necessary especially in the correspondence between the multi - cut matrix models and fractional superstring theory @xcite , discovery of the general formula for the multi - cut two - matrix models",
    "is one of the most important stage in understanding the conjectured duality as well as the system itself .    in this paper , the generalization of these formulae",
    "are explored especially in the @xmath0 symmetric potential @xmath25 , @xmath26 of the general @xmath2-cut two - matrix models @xmath27 . identifying a proper ansatz for the non - polynomial part of the amplitudes ( generalizing the square - root of ( [ introsupersesh ] ) ) ,",
