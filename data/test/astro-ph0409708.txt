    "the observed scaling relation between masses of black holes and galactic bulges @xcite strongly suggests that galaxies co - evolved with their galactic nuclei during the hierarchical formation of galaxies .",
    "there has been a number of theoretical efforts to understand the origin of the relation between the black hole mass ( @xmath7 ) and bulge mass or stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath8 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed , using a semi - analytic approach , that many observational aspects of galaxy evolution and quasars can be reproduced if the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are formed during major mergers of galaxies .",
    "@xcite proposed that the radiation drag arising from the radiation field in a galactic bulge could effectively work to accrete gas to a seed back hole , and that it results in the correlation between the smbhs and the bulges .",
    "@xcite presented a semi - analytic model for early coevolution of massive spheroidal galaxies and agns , and claimed that feedback from supernovae and from agns determines the scaling relation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "introducing one free parameter , i.e. the returning fraction of agn energy to the galactic gas , @xcite showed that the ratio between the bh mass and the stellar mass of the galactic spheroid should be @xmath9 .",
    "these studies rely on semi - analytic approaches with various assumptions and models . on the other hand",
    ", direct numerical simulation of galaxy formation can be a complementary approach .",
    "using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , di matteo et al.(2003 ) followed evolution of the gas , stars , and the dark matter in forming galaxies , and they found that the observed relation , @xmath10 , is reproduced if the gas mass ( @xmath11 ) in the bulges is linearly proportional to the black hole mass , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "this work directly shows gas mass fractions in dense regions of assembling galaxies , which can be used to reduce the number of free parameters in semi - analytic approaches .",
    "however , the numerical resolutions of di matteo et al.(2003 ) are quite limited ; the mass resolutions are @xmath13 , and the gravitational softening lengths are @xmath14 kpc . with these resolutions , it is impossible to resolve the structure of the central sub - kpc region of galaxies .",
    "one would expect that the structure of the inner part of galaxies is more closely related with growth of the smbhs .",
    "therefore it is important to show a relation between the baryonic mass in the central region of galaxies and assembling of the galaxies in their formation history .    in this letter",
    ", we show evolution of the central stellar and gaseous cores on a sub - kpc scale during formation of a small ( total mass is @xmath15 ) spiral galaxy through the hierarchical mergers , using high - resolution n - body / sph simulations ( one sph particle has @xmath16 and a softening length of @xmath17 pc ) .",
    "the method used here is a standard numerical technique for simulating galaxy - formation .",
    "details of the simulations will appear elsewhere ( saitoh et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we model formation of galaxies in the cdm universe using a standard hybrid n - body / hydrodynamic code including the radiative cooling and star formation .",
    "we use the tree ",
    "algorithm with a special purpose computer , grape ( gravity pipe ) @xcite , for solving self - gravity , and sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) for gas dynamics .",
    "we use a single grape-5 board @xcite connected with a host computer .",
    "we employ a shear - free formulation of the artifical viscosity to reduce unphysical angular momentum transfer in a shear flow @xcite .",
    "the technique is also applied to simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to model the multi - phase nature of the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we solve an energy equation with the radiative cooling below @xmath18 k and the inverse comption cooling .",
    "we set the gas has a primordial abundance with @xmath19 and @xmath20 and we assume an ideal gas with @xmath21 . in the sph simulations ,",
    "the jeans instability can be resolved correctly for masses larger than @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are mass of an sph particle and the number of neighbor particles .",
    "note that @xmath23 does not simply represent the mass resolution .",
    "we use @xmath25 and @xmath26 , therefore we can resolve gravitational instability of a cloud mass @xmath27 . the temperature of this critical cloud is @xmath28 k for the number density @xmath29 @xmath30 .    the star formation algorithm we used is similar to one by @xcite . if an sph particle satisfies all the following conditions : ( 1 ) high density ( @xmath31 ) , ( 2 ) the regions are in virialized halos ( @xmath32 ) , where @xmath33 is the background density , ( 3 ) low temperature ( t@xmath34k ) , and ( 4 )",
    "collapsing regions ( @xmath35 ) , then it is changed to a collisionless star particle , within @xmath36 30 free - fall time with the same velocity and mass of the sph particle . in other word ,",
    "a local star formation rate is assumed to be sfr @xmath37 with @xmath38 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one should note , however , that these criteria for star formation in our simulations are almost equivalent to that for star formation in the jeans unstable cloud .",
    "dynamical and radiative feedback processes from star formation and supernova explosions are not taken into account .",
    "the number of dark matter and sph particles is @xmath39 .",
    "the gravitational softening lengths are comovingly evolved from the beginning of simulations to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "after @xmath40 , the lengths are fixed at 52 pc for sph and star particles and 108 pc for dm particles .",
    "our mass and special resolutions are extremely fine compared with recent simulations of galaxy formation such as @xcite with @xmath41 per a gas particle and a softening length of 0.5 kpc .    in order to use the number of particles as many as possible with our computer systems ,",
    "we employ a top - hat initial condition with an open boundary for a single galactic halo , assuming the ` standard ' cdm model .",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the collapse epoch of the halo is set at @xmath47 .",
    "the spin parameter of the halo is 0.05 .",
    "since the total mass of the object in our simulation is small ( @xmath48 ) and the collapse epoch , @xmath47 , is earlier than that of much larger systems such as clusters of galaxies , the results do not strongly depend on the employed cosmology , especially with or without @xmath49 term .",
    "the mass accretion phase is almost finished at @xmath50 .",
    "the employed boundary condition in our simulation would not be relevant to discuss evolution at low-@xmath51 ( i.e. @xmath52 ) . in this letter",
    ", we discuss the evolution of galaxies until @xmath53 .",
    "the initial condition is created by cosmics @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows snapshots of gas and stars at redshift @xmath54 , 3.3 , and @xmath55 showing the assembling process of a small spiral galaxy . two proto  galaxies are about to merge at @xmath56 . at @xmath57 , one of them",
    "is the small galaxy with a tidal tail seen at ( + 5 kpc,-3 kpc ) .",
    "many dwarf satellites will merge into a single spiral galaxy . at @xmath58 ,",
    "spiral arms are formed in the gas disk , and spirals of young stars are also seen .",
    "these spiral structures are results of past major mergers like the one at @xmath56 .",
    "gaseous clumps are not prominent at this stage , but many stellar clusters are orbiting around the central galaxies .",
    "tidally disrupted stellar clusters are also seen in this plot .",
    "the three panels of figure 2 are projections of a central 5 kpc of the gas disk from three different directions at @xmath53 .",
    "these clearly show that the inner part of the gas is not aligned with the outer one .",
    "we can also see that the gas is not distributed in a smoothed ` disk ' , but rather in many rings .",
    "we found that the baryonic core ( @xmath59 kpc ) of the galaxy grows through the mergings of satellites .",
    "two different processes of the growth are found : merging of gas - rich satellites and merging of stellar satellites .",
    "the former process dominates at high - z , and as a result of the merging events , a large amount of the gas is supplied in the galactic central region .",
    "this results in burst of star formation and a stellar core is formed . on the other hand , at low - z , gases in the satellites",
    "are already consumed , therefore nearly pure - stellar satellites accrete into the host galaxy , and they are eventually going to merge with the galactic core .",
    "more quantitatively , in our model , 34% of the baryon in the core at @xmath53 is originated in stars in satellites formed at @xmath60 kpc .",
    "49% of the baryon in the core at @xmath58 are formed form the accreted gas .",
    "the angular momentum of the stellar core ( @xmath59 kpc ) at @xmath58 is about 7% of the angular momentum of its gaseous / stellar progenitors at @xmath61 . for the gas phase ,",
    "shocks and gravitational torque probably contribute the transfer of the angular momentum , and stellar satellites are accreted due to dynamical friction with stars and the dark matter of the host galaxy .",
    "figure 3 is the evolution of the stellar and gaseous masses inside 300 pc from the center as a function of the halo mass ( the mass inside a virial radius , which is 13 kpc at @xmath62 ) of the spiral galaxy .",
    "the baryonic core mass increases as the halo mass is developed due to mergers of smaller proto  galaxies .",
    "we find that the ratio between the baryon mass in the central region and the halo mass stays constant around 0.04 on average from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "one should note , however , that the process of mass increase is not smooth , but a step function - like .",
    "there are episodic ` growing phases ' , where the accretion rate is about ten - times higher than the average value ( @xmath65 yr@xmath6 ) , and each growing phase lasts for about @xmath66 yrs .",
    "each accretion phase seems to be triggered by major mergers with some time delays , which are typically @xmath66 yrs .",
    "the gases in the core are heat up at @xmath67 k at most , then they are rapidly cooled below @xmath18 k. therefore the most accreted gases are cold and rapidly form stars in the core .",
    "the drop of the dashed line for the gas at low-@xmath51 is owing to that the gas in the core region is consumed by the star formation . before @xmath68 ,",
    "supply of gas due to mergers and the consumption of gas in the core are nearly balanced .",
    "accretion of the gas to the central region is decrease since @xmath69 , and it makes the core gas - poor .",
    "figure 4a and 4b are evolution of the normalized angular momentum vector of the gas core ( @xmath59 kpc and @xmath70 kpc ) projected on the @xmath71 plane .",
    "the two plots show that evolution of spin of the gas component depends on the radius .",
    "the inner and outer parts rotate independently ( see also figure 2 ) .",
    "the spin vector of the gas in the core changes more extensively than does that of the outer part . in figure 4a , at @xmath72 , the spin vector points in the @xmath51-direction , but it soon begins to fall , and at @xmath73 , it points toward the @xmath74-axis , and then at @xmath75 it points toward the @xmath76-axis .",
    "the direction of the spin keeps changing towards @xmath77 .",
    "the sharp changes of the spins are because of frequent mergers followed by mass accretion to the center .",
    "the spin vector of the gas supplied by each merger event is generally different from that of the already formed gas core , and therefore the angular momentum of the gas core is changed extensively .",
    "using high - resolution n - body / sph simulation of formation of a spiral galaxy , we directly show that the galactic core ( @xmath78 pc ) coevolves with the galactic dark halo of a 10 kpc scale between @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "the mass of the core increases with development of the halo mass , and , as a result , the mass ratio between them stays nearly constant around 0.04 .",
    "there are episodic ` growing phases ' , in which the rate of mass accretion to the core is much higher than the average .",
    "each growing phase lasts for @xmath79 yrs .",
    "if the rapid increase of the gas mass in the central sub - kpc scale causes further mass accretion to the nucleus , due to , for example , an increase in turbulent viscosity @xcite or radiation drag originating in the nuclear starburst @xcite , the growing phases might correspond to quasar activities .",
    "if this is the case , the central smbh also grows , and as a result , the mass of the smbh naturally correlates with the galactic total mass .",
    "we also found that the angular momentum of the nuclear disk is decoupled with the large scale galactic spin .",
    "this would be interesting in terms of the relation between the agn jets and the rotational axes of disks in seyfert galaxies @xcite and dust disks in radio galaxies ( schmitt et al .",
    "it is naturally expected that the spin axes of the cores are randomly directed if the the gas core is formed by the accreted gas from past mergers .",
    "if this is the case , the accretion to the smbh and triggers of the agns should be affected by the angular momentum of the accreted material .",
    "gas dynamics in two merging spiral galaxies have been studied using n - body / sph simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite revealed that gas inflows are enhanced by major mergers , and that the gaseous angular momentum is removed mainly by the gravitational torque .",
    "similarly , gaseous response in each merging process in our simulation is probably dominated by non - axisymmetric gravitational perturbations .",
    "minor mergers are also important to accrete gas into the central region @xcite . in our simulations , we observe many minor mergers , and these also contribute to the temporal increase in the accretion rate seen in figure 3 .    in order to investigate the effects of @xmath80 , i.e. star formation rate ( sfr ) , for the evolution of the galactic core , we run low - resolution tests , @xmath81 with @xmath80 = 0.33 and 0.033 . for the same @xmath82 ,",
    "the evolution of the core between the simulation of @xmath81 is qualitatively similar to that in the high resolution model ( @xmath83 ) , as described in $ 3 .",
    "galactic cores evolve through major mergers , and then the masses of cores against the masses of halos keep almost constant during the evolution . however , the growth of the core in the two test simulations are different for ten - times higher sfr , i.e. @xmath84",
    ". this high conversion rate allows gas to become stars more quickly before gases form tightly bound core in each satellite by the effect of dissipation process . as a result ,",
    "forming stellar clusters are also bound more loosely and they are easily destroyed before they reach to the galactic core .",
    "most gas component is consumed by the high sfr , and therefore accretion of the gas , which is an important process to form the baryonic core at high-@xmath51 , is not effective .",
    "thereby , baryon is less concentrate than the case of @xmath85 .    in the present model",
    ", we did not take into account effects of radiative and mechanical feedback from star forming activities .",
    "multiple supernova explosions followed by the galactic wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could prevent accretion of the baryons toward the galactic center @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the mass fraction of the baryonic core in our current model would be an `` upper limit '' .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to directly follow interaction between the multiple blastwaves and the ism with the current numerical resolution ( @xmath86 50 pc ) .",
    "@xcite have performed three - dimensional , high resolution ( 0.25 pc ) hydrodynamic simulations of multiple sne in an inhomogeneous , turbulent medium in the galactic central 100 pc region .",
    "they found that even if the supernova rate is very high ( 0.8 sne / yr ) , most of the dense gas stay around the central region and form a massive ` torus ' .",
    "this is mainly because most of the gas mass is in a form of cold , dense gases , and only a small fraction of the gas mass can escape from the region as a hot gas .",
    "therefore we expect that sne would not affect significantly the gas mass in the central region of the dark halo potential . on the other hand , stellar feedback",
    "would be more serious in the sub - clumps surrounding the host galaxy . if this is the case , formation of the stellar cluster in the small dark halos is suppressed , and as a result the baryonic mass of the core would become smaller .",
    "feedback from the back ground uv radiation would be also affect formation of small stellar systems @xcite .",
