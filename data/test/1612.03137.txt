    "the recently revised aleph data @xcite for the vector ( @xmath1 ) and axial ( @xmath2 ) non - strange hadronic spectral functions extracted from @xmath0 decays led to renewed efforts to extract the strong coupling @xmath3 from these data @xcite .",
    "these updates employ different methods : while perturbation theory and the operator product expansion ( ope ) are central to both , they differ in the way they treat resonance effects , or , equivalently , violations of quark - hadron duality ( dvs ) @xcite .",
    "the method employed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( the `` truncated - ope - model '' strategy ) aims to suppress dvs sufficiently to be able to ignore them altogether , while the method of ref .",
    "@xcite ( the `` dv - model '' strategy ) models dvs explicitly .",
    "these two approaches lead to values for @xmath3 which differ by about 8% , while the errors claimed by each method are significantly smaller than that .",
    "both approaches start from finite - energy sum rules ( fesrs ) @xcite , relating weighted integrals of the experimental spectral function to a representation of the theory in terms of @xmath3 and non - perturbative effects , captured by higher - dimension terms in the ope , and , in the case of the dv - model strategy , a representation of dvs .",
    "the truncated - ope - model strategy uses weight functions that suppress dvs and restricts the fesrs to the largest energy available , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 , but requires terms in the ope up to dimension 16 . as we will see below , this necessitates an _",
    "ad hoc _ truncation of the ope in order to be able to fit the data provided by the spectral integrals , a truncation for which there is no basis in qcd .",
    "the dv - model strategy models dvs explicitly , and makes use of the energy dependence of the sum rules , requiring the ope only up to dimension 8 , with no truncation necessary .",
    "both strategies need to be tested for consistency , because both make assumptions in order to handle non - perturbative effects .    here",
    "we provide a critical appraisal of the truncated - ope strategy , focussing on the most recent and very extensive application @xcite of this strategy to the aleph data .",
    "we focus on the analysis of the @xmath5 non - strange spectral data , as these have been advertized as being least affected by duality violations , the neglect of which is central to this strategy .",
    "we find that this strategy is fundamentally flawed , as a number of tests show unambiguously that the value for @xmath3 through this strategy is afflicted by uncontrolled systematic errors related to problems with its treatment of non - perturbative physics .",
    "this brief writeup summarizes only some of the highlights of our analysis .",
    "an extensive account can be found in ref .",

    "@xcite we refer to refs .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite , as a by - product , provides further support for the dv - model strategy as well .",
    "the extraction of @xmath3 from the non - strange @xmath1 or @xmath2 spectral functions @xmath6 starts from the sum rule @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the ope approximation to the exact @xmath1 or @xmath2 current two - point function , given by @xmath9 @xmath10 represents the part not captured by the ope , the so - called `` duality violations '' ( dvs ) , and @xmath11 is a polynomial weight .",
    "( for a derivation of the sum rule , and the precise meaning of all quantities , see ref .",
    "an important observation for the analysis to follow is that a monomial of degree @xmath12 in the weight @xmath13 picks out the term of order @xmath14 in the ope , because @xmath15 the @xmath16 term in the ope represents the mass - independent , purely perturbative contribution , which is available to @xmath17 @xcite . in the literature , two different resummation schemes , `` fixed - order '' ( fo or fopt ) and `` contour - improved '' ( ci or cipt ) @xcite have been employed .",

    "the analysis of ref .  @xcite starts with the weights @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and takes @xmath20 in the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) .",
    "since @xmath21 is negligibly small , the parameters in the fit to these 5 weighted integrals would be @xmath22 and @xmath23 , because @xmath24 has degree 7 ( _ cf . _  eq .  ( [ degreecond ] ) )",
    ". thus , in order to make a fit possible , one chooses @xmath25 .",
    "the hope is that the suppression of the vicinity of the contribution near the real axis at @xmath26 by the double or triple zero in @xmath27 is sufficient to ignore the dv term in eq .",

    "the thick blue curve ( which is the sum of the two dot - dashed curves ) shows the @xmath5 model underlying the fake data set , and it is perfectly consistent with the aleph data .",
    "the thin dashed black curve shows the perturbative part of the spectral function .",
    "two observations are notable : first , the dynamics of qcd , which corresponds to the _ difference _ of the data and the horizontal line at @xmath33 has a large duality - violating contribution in comparison to perturbation theory , as evidenced by the clearly visible resonance oscillations in the data .",
    "second , the model curve shows a large dv at @xmath34 , larger , in fact , than at any other value of @xmath31 above @xmath35  gev@xmath36 , even though the dvs are exponentially damped toward large @xmath31 .",
    "this large effect leads to a significant upward shift in the fitted value of @xmath22 away from the exact model value if dvs are entirely ignored , as we found in sec .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we conducted an extensive study of the truncated - ope strategy for obtaining @xmath3 from hadronic @xmath0 decay data , taking the most recent such analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite as our starting point .",
    "a key component of the truncated - ope strategy is the arbitrary truncation of the ope .",
    "in addition , this strategy claims that it is safe to neglect dvs , employing weighted spectral integrals which suppress their contribution .",
    "we demonstrated in secs .  3 and 4 that these assumptions cause the truncated - ope strategy to fail .",
    "it is not capable of detecting residual dvs , and , together with the unavoidable , but uncontrolled truncation of the ope , it leads to values for @xmath3 about 8% too high , even though the error is claimed to be less than 4% .",
    "this difference is larger than the long - standing difference between fopt- and cipt - based results .",
