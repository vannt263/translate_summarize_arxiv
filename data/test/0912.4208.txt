    "recently , higgs flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) in randall - sundrum @xcite ( rs ) models have received a lot of attention .",
    "a model independent analysis was performed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and it was shown that a light composite higgs that couples strongly to new heavy states can lead to significant bounds on the compositeness scale from @xmath2 oscillations . in @xcite , where only the first fermionic kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations in the custodially protected rs model ( rsc )",
    "were considered it was found that tree - level higgs fcncs are negligible . however , in contrast to this in @xcite it was pointed out that the summation over the whole kk tower of fermionic excitations yields a finite contribution to higgs fcncs . in the same paper also the resulting higgs contribution to @xmath0 was calculated and a higgs - mass - dependent bound on the kk mass scale was deduced . while the strongest bound on the kk mass scale in rs models with a brane higgs is due to the tree - level exchange of kk gluons @xcite , the bound deduced in @xcite is well of the same order of magnitude , at least for a light higgs . in view of these new results",
    "it is mandatory to compare the bounds on the kk scale that are required to keep under control the effects of the tree level exchanges of kk gluons on the one hand and of the higgs boson on the other hand . in particular",
    "this is necessary since the bounds of @xcite and @xcite are not comparable to each other without further ado as they depend on the authors prejudices towards naturalness or the experimental and theoretical uncertainties in @xmath0 .",
    "even more so these assumptions are implicit in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : higgs - fcncs ] we briefly review the results for the flavor off - diagonal higgs couplings derived in @xcite and comment on their renormalization group ( rg ) evolution .",
    "section [ sec : epsk ] is devoted to the calculation of @xmath0 in terms of the flavor off - diagonal higgs couplings in the brane - higgs scenario . in section",
    "[ sec : numerical_results ] we compare our results for the higgs and kk gluon contributions in the brane higgs scenario and show how this result can be generalized to the case of a bulk higgs .",
    "our conclusions finally are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "[ sec : higgs - fcncs ] in this section we briefly recapitulate the main results of @xcite and comment on the rg evolution of the flavor off - diagonal higgs couplings .",
    "a detailed description of the model setup as well as the notation used in the present paper can be found in @xcite . to set some additional notation we explicitly write out the relevant lagrangian @xmath3_{ij}\\sum\\limits_{n_2=0}^\\infty d_r^{j(n_2)}h + \\sum\\limits_{m_1=1}^\\infty\\bar d_l^{i(m_1)}\\left[\\hat y_2\\right]_{ij}\\sum\\limits_{m_2=1}^\\infty q_r^{j(m_2)}h+h.c.\\ , , \\label{eq : l_yuk}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fundamental 5d yukawa matrices .",
    "flavor off - diagonal higgs couplings in the mass eigenbasis can arise whenever the rs contributions to quark masses and to the yukawa couplings are not aligned . in the mass insertion approximation",
    "the rs contributions up to @xmath6 are represented by the two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : mia ] with the couplings given in ( [ eq : l_yuk ] ) .",
    "the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : mia ] contributes equally to the quarks masses after ewsb and their yukawa couplings .",
    "the second diagram however affects masses and yukawa couplings in a different manner since its contribution to the yukawa couplings comes with a combinatorial factor of three that is due to the three different choices of which two external higgs lines are set to their vevs .",
    "this shift between quark masses and yukawa couplings results in flavor off - diagonal higgs couplings once we go to the mass eigenstate basis .    ,",
    "height=94 ]    at a first glance the overall contribution from the second diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : mia ] seems to be negligible since both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes obey dirichlet boundary conditions on the ir brane . in @xcite",
    "the point has been made that the profiles of @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not exactly vanish on the ir brane but display a small discontinuity that is proportional to the higgs vev .",
    "after regularization of this discontinuity and summing over the infinite tower of kk modes it is found that a non - vanishing misalignment between quark masses and yukawa couplings is generated by this diagram . at this point it is appropriate to call the reader s attention to the fact that the yukawa matrix @xmath5 that couples the scalar currents @xmath9 to the higgs field is not required for the generation of quark masses and hence could be set to zero which would eliminate the second diagram s contribution to flavor off - diagonal higgs couplings .",
    "however , since this choice for @xmath5 without profound physical reason contradicts naturalness , in the following we will set @xmath5 to be equal is mandatory in the bulk higgs scenario . ] to @xmath4 .",
    "an additional source of misalignment between quark masses and yukawa couplings is the modification of the kinetic terms by the mixing of sm quarks and kk quarks after ewsb as was first pointed out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these flavor - dependent corrections to the kinetic terms make redefinitions of the quark fields necessary which in turn give rise to an additional shift between quark masses and yukawa couplings . for the first two generations of quarks",
    "this contribution is found to be negligible , for the third generation however this effect can be of the same size as the one outlined above .",
    "+ after this rather qualitative description we now summarize the main results of @xcite for the case of a brane - localized higgs field .",
    "the total misalignment between quark masses and yukawa couplings comprises two contributions , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the contribution represented by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : mia ] and @xmath12 is due to rescaling of the quark fields as to canonize their kinetic terms .",

    "the yukawa couplings have to be evolved down to the scale @xmath26 of the higgs mass where new effective interactions are generated by tree level exchanges of the higgs boson .",
    "the rg evolution of these couplings is in fact identical to that of quark masses and is well known to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) . from this scale",
    "the wilson coefficients of the new operators then have to be evolved down to the physically relevant scale @xmath27 according to their individual anomalous dimensions .",
    "these rg effects have been neglected in recent publications discussing higgs fcncs , e.g.  @xcite . for a complete numerical analysis",

    "result in a breakdown of perturbativity at energies below the mass of the second kk excitation ( see eg .  @xcite for more details ) and that too small values tend to require the right - handed top - quark to be extremely localized towards the infrared ( ir ) brane .",
    "the nine quark bulk mass parameters @xmath80 are then determined such that the quark masses and ckm mixing angles are reproduced , which can be much facilitated by using the froggatt - nielsen formalism @xcite . finally , we keep only those parameter sets that in addition to the quark masses and ckm mixing angles also reproduce the proper value of the jarlskog determinant , all within their respective @xmath81 ranges .    since for given fundamental yukawa matrices",
    "the choice of bulk mass parameters @xmath80 is not unique due to the transformation @xmath82 as was pointed out in @xcite , we additionally specify that in our scan @xmath83 is taken .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the numerical consequences of modifying a given set of parameters according to ( [ eq : shift - symmetry ] ) for @xmath2 mixing are small for @xmath84 values of @xmath85 .",
    "+ in the following we will scan the parameter space of the rsc model in the way described above . to make the statements of this paper fully traceable , we mention the three additional assumptions :    * the fundamental yukawa matrix @xmath5 is equal to @xmath4 , * the 5d qcd coupling constant at the kk scale is taken to by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , * the higgs field is localized at the ir brane ( @xmath88 ) .    in this , @xmath89 is considered to be a natural choice as this is mandatory in the case of a bulk higgs . the value @xmath90 is obtained from tree level matching of the 5d to the 4d qcd coupling constants . in the case of loop level matching the minimal value @xmath87",
    "is obtained , while gluonic brane kinetic terms could enhance @xmath91 beyond the tree level value @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath91 is bounded from above by perturbativity considerations .",
    "the requirement that the theory is perturbative beyond the second kk excitation results in a ( conservative ) upper bound of @xmath87 , and @xmath90 is already disfavored by this estimate @xcite . to allow for a better comparison with the previous analyses @xcite",
    "we still include the higher value @xmath90 into our analysis .",
    "+ changes in @xmath91 will change the relative and absolute sizes of the kk gluon and higgs contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "also , the hierarchy between gauge boson and higgs contributions is affected by the localization of the higgs field along the fifth dimension and the average absolute size @xmath92 of the 5d yukawa couplings .",
    "more precisely , in the bulk higgs scenario the overlap integral of the higgs with the fermionic zero mode profiles also receives contributions from the fermions bulk profiles .",
    "this allows to localize the fermion profiles closer to the uv brane which in turn decreases the overlap of the fermion modes with kk gauge bosons and thus diminishes the impact of kk gauge bosons on @xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand , as was argued in @xcite the size of the flavor changing higgs couplings is only mildly affected by the higgs localization . in consequence , detaching the higgs field from the ir brane increases the relative importance of the higgs contribution .",
    "increasing the average absolute size @xmath92 allows to move the fermion profiles closer to the uv brane , with the same effect as described above , but beyond that at the same time the higgs contribution to @xmath0 is increased .",
    "thus larger 5d yukawa couplings also increase the relative importance of the higgs contribution .",
    "we will investigate the impact of deviations of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the higgs localization parameter @xmath93 from their values chosen above in detail at the end of this section .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : relative ] we show the relative sizes of the kk gluon and higgs contributions to @xmath0 for a kk scale @xmath94 for two values of the fundamental qcd coupling constant , @xmath87 and @xmath95 , and for two values of the higgs mass , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite where the combined gauge boson correction to @xmath0 was considered we here give the purely gluonic contribution . however , as was shown in @xcite , the impact of electroweak ( ew ) gauge bosons to @xmath2 oscillations is small compared to the impact of kk gluons .     for @xmath96 ( left ) and",

    "[ fig : relative],title=\"fig : \" ]    from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : relative ] we see that even in the case @xmath99 in which the relative size of the higgs contribution is maximal , most of the points in parameter space yield a much larger kk gluon contribution than higgs contribution . for more than 65% of all data points the higgs contribution is smaller than 10% of the kk gluon contribution .",
    "if the kk gluon contribution is accidentally small , it may well be exceeded by the higgs contribution , however it is the data points that yield too large corrections to @xmath0 that will eventually set the bound on the kk mass scale .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ft ] we show the average barbieri - giudice @xcite fine - tuning of those points in parameter space that satisfy the @xmath0 constraint to @xmath100 for the kk gluon case with @xmath87 ( left ) and for the higgs case with @xmath96 ( right ) .    from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ft ] we can read off that depending on the amount of generic fine - tuning one is willing to accept a bound on the kk mass scale between @xmath101 and @xmath102 is required to keep the impact of kk gluon exchange under control ( this is roughly half the value stated in @xcite for @xmath90 ) . under identical conditions",
    "the tree - level higgs exchanges by themselves would imply a bound which is introduced below . ] on the kk mass scale between @xmath103 and @xmath104 for a higgs mass @xmath96 , as can be seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ft ] . for larger higgs masses",
    "the bound gets accordingly weaker .",
    "taken together , figs .",
    "[ fig : relative ] and [ fig : ft ] show that in the brane higgs scenario with @xmath105 ( that roughly corresponds to @xmath106 ) the kk gluon contribution significantly exceeds the higgs contribution for both @xmath90 and @xmath87 .",
    "the tendency of this conclusion is not changed if the typical size of the yukawa couplings @xmath92 is raised to the maximal value that is compatible with the perturbativity estimate @xmath107 .",
    "so while in the brane higgs case the tree - level exchange of the higgs boson indisputably has an impact on @xmath0 , the strongest bound on the kk mass scale for all values of the fundamental qcd coupling @xmath91 and all values of the higgs mass comes from the exchange of kk gluons .",
    "+ to extrapolate this finding to the bulk higgs case we use @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 depends on the localization of the higgs field and @xmath110 is the kk fermion yukawa coupling ( in the brane higgs scenario we would have @xmath111 ) . furthermore , from ( [ eq : delta - d-1 ] ) we see that for the higgs contribution to @xmath0 @xmath112 with nearly no dependence on the localization of the higgs field @xcite .    using ( [ eq : gluon - contribution ] ) , ( [ eq : higgs - contribution ] ) we can infer an estimate for the ratio @xmath113 for arbitrary values of @xmath114 from the reference value @xmath115 that is determined for @xmath116 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath117 where the ratio @xmath115 is found to be @xmath118 and @xmath109 is given for several values of @xmath93 in @xcite : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - ratio ] we show the ratio as a function of @xmath93 for two different values of @xmath110 .",
    "the lower curve corresponds to the maximal value consistent with the perturbativity estimate , @xmath123 ( where an additional factor @xmath124 is due to the localization of the higgs in the bulk @xcite ) , and the upper one to the value @xmath125 , that corresponds to the average if values are randomly chosen between @xmath126 and the maximal value .",
    "we observe that as soon as the higgs field is detached from the ir brane the higgs contribution to @xmath0 can in principle exceed the kk gluon contribution , although depending on the typical size of yukawa couplings this outcome is not imperative .",
    "the possible dominance of the higgs contributions is largely due to the increase of the maximally allowed value for @xmath110 by a factor of @xmath124 , but also by the shift of the quark zero modes towards the uv brane that becomes possible for a bulk higgs .    at this point",
    "it is important to keep in mind that observables that depend on positive powers of @xmath110 , such as the neutron edm @xmath127 @xcite , @xmath128",
    "@xcite and @xmath129 @xcite for fixed @xmath130 constrain the size of the yukawa couplings such that the above statements are only sensible if the isolated @xmath0 constraint is considered .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] in this paper we have carefully compared the impact of kk gluon and higgs exchanges on the observable @xmath0 in the brane higgs scenario .",
    "subsequently we have extrapolated our results to the case of a bulk higgs and given estimates for the relative size of kk gluon and higgs contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "a comparison of kk gluon and higgs contributions to @xmath0 is mandatory since up to now those two contributions were never treated simultaneously and the generic bounds on the kk scale deduced from their presence hence depend on different and often implicit assumptions .",
    "these assumptions for instance include the uncertainties within which an observable is required to be reproduced or the individual acceptance of fine - tuning .",
    "in the course of our analysis we have shown in detail how the value of the low energy observable @xmath0 can be derived from the misalignment of quark mass matrices and yukawa couplings at the kk scale for which analytic expressions were derived in @xcite .",
    "of particular importance in this context is the proper employment of the rg equations .",
    "while the wilson coefficients of the effective interactions induced by kk gluon exchange have to be run down from the kk scale to the physical scale according to their anomalous dimension , this is different for the case of the higgs induced contributions . here",
    "the anomalous higgs couplings that are induced at the kk scale have to be evolved down to the scale of the higgs boson mass where new interactions are generated by the exchange of the higgs boson .",
    "from there , as in the kk gluon case , the wilson coefficients of the effective interactions have to be evolved to the physical scale according to their anomalous dimensions .    as an outcome of our analysis",
    "we have shown that while higgs fcncs have an impact on @xmath0 as was already pointed out in @xcite , their contribution for a brane higgs is dwarfed by the contribution of kk gluons even in the most favorable scenario for the higgs contributions . for a brane higgs scenario with reasonable choices fundamental yukawa couplings the bound on the kk scale implied by the presence of tree - level higgs exchanges",
    "is found to be @xmath131 , to be compared to the corresponding bounds for kk gluon exchange that are given by @xmath132 for @xmath87 and @xmath133 for @xmath90 ( see also @xcite ) .    tentatively extrapolating this result to the case of a bulk higgs",
    "we find that the higgs contribution to @xmath0 can exceed the kk gluon contribution as soon as the higgs field is detached from the ir brane if the yukawa couplings are assumed to have the maximal value still consistent with perturbativity estimates .",
    "this is largely due to larger allowed values for the yukawa couplings in the presence of a bulk higgs . for yukawa couplings smaller by a factor of two",
    "than the maximal value the kk gluon contributions are typically larger than the higgs contributions for higgs localizations @xmath93 down to @xmath134 .",
    "finally we would like to mention that in the present work we only studied the isolated constraint on the kk scale arising from the observable @xmath0 .",

    "the rs contributions to these observables are proportional to @xmath135 such that for values of @xmath110 as large as the perturbativity bound the strongest individual bound on @xmath130 typically comes from on of those observables instead of @xmath0 .",
