    "as resistivity increases the magnetic field that can be generated by the mri before the tearing modes become dynamically important reaches an asymptotic value .",
    "however , due to the alignment of the mri magnetic field with the azimuthal direction at low elsasser number , the situation is quite different for the stresses .",
    "the stresses produced by the mri primary modes , at the time when the fastest tearing modes have growth rates similar to their own , decay linearly with decreasing elsasser number , i.e. , @xmath358 for @xmath114 .",
    "this behavior seems consistent with numerical simulations of resistive mhd shearing boxes , where the stresses at saturation decrease linearly with elsasser number ( see table  1 in @xcite ; note that the associated elsasser numbers in the more resistive runs are somewhat larger than unity ) .    in the region of parameter space where our analysis overlaps with the regime accessible to numerical simulations , the values of @xmath359 are within factors of a few of the values obtained in the turbulent regime .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the dependence on the stresses at saturation on the magnetic prandtl number is less pronounced and the predicted value of @xmath243 is smaller , by a factor of 6 at @xmath360 , than that found in the non - linear simulations of @xcite .",
    "part of these differences can be accounted for with a more sensible operational definition of saturation .",
    "@xcite provide a way to estimate the amplitude of the fields at saturation when primary and secondary modes reach comparable amplitudes based on the values obtained when they reach equal growth rates .",
    "they conclude that the overshoot factor , which depends logarithmically on the initial amplitude of the parasite , is likely between @xmath361 and @xmath145 .",
    "these arguments should also be applicable at low elsasser numbers since they mainly rely on the fact that the growth rate of the secondary modes is linear in the amplitude of the primary mri mode .",
    "it is then conceivable that the asymptotic analysis carried out in this paper could provide , within factors of a few , a reasonable description of the saturation level in a wide region of parameter space .",
    "we explored in detail the physics of the eigenmodes with fastest growth rates in the regime where variations in the elsasser number lead to non - trivial modifications to the structure of the parasitic modes . to this end",
    "we emphasized the importance of understanding the structure of the vorticity and current density patterns associated with the secondary instabilities and used these as a mean to confirm their association with kelvin - helmholtz and tearing mode instabilities .",
    "our analysis suggests a strategy to recognize the presence of parasitic modes and attempt to identify their nature : ( i ) evolve the simulation until the breakdown of the initial exponential growth or subsequent peaks in stress or magnetic energy .",
    "( ii ) dissect the simulation domain in planes perpendicular to the mid - plane that contain the @xmath56-axis .",
    "( iii ) project the velocity and magnetic field in these planes and take the curls in order to obtain the corresponding vorticity and current density .",
    "( iv ) determine whether these resemble what is expected from the kelvin - helmholtz or tearing mode instabilities discussed in section  [ sec : eigenmodes ] .",
    "understanding from first principles the saturation of the mhd turbulence , and the associated angular momentum transport , driven by the mri under realistic physical conditions ( including , ambipolar diffusion , compressibility , stratification , radiation , etc . ) is a challenging endeavor .",
    "the results presented throughout this study provide guidance toward understanding some of the key physical processes that are likely to play a role in halting the exponential growth of the mri and , more speculatively , in the subsequent turbulent state ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , there is numerical evidence suggesting that ohmic heating due to the reconnection of mri field lines is an important source of energy in shearing box simulations of resistive mhd @xcite . in allowing for non - zero resistivity and calculating the currents associated with the secondary instabilities , we have gone one step forward in establishing the chain of processes that enable the conversion of gravitational energy into thermal energy in differentially rotating , magnetized , non - ideal plasmas .    as a final comment , we mention two limitations that result from our working assumptions that are worth emphasizing due to their potential significance ( see also the related discussion in section 2.4 in @xcite ) : ( i ) we have neglected the effects of shear on the dynamics of the secondary modes .",
    "non - axisymmetric parasitic modes will shear linearly in time @xcite ; therefore , assuming fixed horizontal versors to characterize a parasitic mode is an approximation .",
    "( ii ) we have not considered the explicit coupling between the evolution of the mri - modes and the secondary instabilities . as",
    "the secondary modes grow they drain energy from the primary modes ; therefore the secondary growth rates , that rely on the amplitude of the mri modes , could be affected .",
    "both of these effects are likely to diminish the ability of the parasitic modes discussed here to slow the growth of the mri , or the subsequent `` channel flows '' .",
    "thus the extrapolation of the results presented here to the non - linear regime should be complemented with the pertinent quota of skepticism .",
    "having said this , at present , the properties of parasitic modes provide valuable analytical guidance and a basic framework to design and interpret tailored numerical experiments in order to shed light into the non - linear saturation of the mri ."
