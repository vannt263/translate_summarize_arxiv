    ", several schemes have been proposed to deal with decoherence , including decoherence free subspace  @xcite , quantum zeno effect  @xcite , and dynamical decoupling  @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , it has been realized that entanglement represents only a special kind of nonclassical correlation .",

    "the original quantum discord is defined by the difference between the quantum mutual information and the classical correlation  @xcite .",
    "other measures of discord such as relative entropy of discord  @xcite , geometric discord  @xcite , trace - distance discord  @xcite have also been proposed based on the idea that the desired correlation is the distance from a given state to the closest state without the desired property . for pure states , discord is equivalent to entanglement , while for general mixed states , it is more robust against decoherence than entanglement  @xcite . rather than suddenly vanishing of entanglement in a finite time ( entanglement sudden death  @xcite ) under decoherence",
    ", the quantum discord vanishes asymptotically and may exhibit the phenomenon of sudden change  @xcite or sudden transition  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a discord - like quantifier termed as negativity of quantumness has also been proposed  @xcite and experimentally reported  @xcite .",
    "negativity of quantumness is the minimum negativity created between the system and the apparatus which performs local measurements on subsystems and thus quantifies the degree of non - classicality on the measured subsystems determined by which and how many subsystems are measured  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "a precise description of the open dynamics process is also desirable .",
    "when the environment is infinitely sized and weakly coupled to the quantum system , the reduced system dynamics under born - markov approximation can be treated as a markovian process and a master equation of lindblad form can be derived  @xcite .",
    "the markovian process should be memoryless , and revival dynamics is usually referred to a signature of non - markovian effect  @xcite    however , the non - markovianity , which is a measure of the degree of non - markovian effect in open systems , is usually difficult to calculate  @xcite due to the optimization over all pairs of initial states and the accumulation of all information back flowed . in this paper",

    "we study the dynamics of non - classicality of the qubit system . it is shown that revivals of the negativity of quantumnes can be treated as a signature of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "moreover , we introduce a measure of the non - markovianity based on the negativity of quantumness and investigate the influences of bath criticality , bath temperature and bath size on the non - markovianity .",
    "it is observed that the non - markovianity converges to zero very sensitively at the critical point as the bath size is enlarged . besides",

    "here , we proposed an alternative manner via quantum correlation to describe the non - markovianity motivated by  @xcite .",

    ", we use the quantum correlation called negativity of quantumness  @xcite as a measure of non - markovianity , which is contractive under markovian channels and may be a suitable quantity for revealing the environmental memory effect .",
    "first , we briefly outline some concepts for the negativity of quantumness .",
    "the negativity of quantumness is a measure of non - classicality which recently is theoretically proposed  @xcite and experimentally reported  @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the minimum negativity created between the system and the apparatus which performs local measurements on subsystems .",
    "the negativity of quantumness thus quantifies the degree of non - classicality on the measured subsystems determined by which and how many subsystems are measured  @xcite . when the measured subsystem is a qubit ( @xmath2 here ) , the negativity of quantumness measuring the non - classicality of subsystem @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the trace norm and a normalization factor @xmath42 has been multiplied . in this case , the negativity of quantumness has a good geometric interpretation such that it is also termed as the one - norm geometric quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "then , by considering the optimal initial system - ancilla state  @xcite , i.e. , an initial maximally entangled state , the non - markovianity can be defined in a similar way to ref .  @xcite as @xmath43 where @xmath37 is the loschmidt echo given by eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) , and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the time point of the @xmath9th local maximum ( minimum ) of @xmath37 during the time @xmath46 . it should be noted that the non - markovianity may diverge  @xcite if non - markovian revivals are infinite . to avoid the divergence , a normalized version of non - markovianity  @xcite",
    "can be introduced as @xmath47 , which is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath48 such that @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 . here , we define an alternative measure of normalized non - markovianity as @xmath53 which calculates the maximum reversal ( backflow ) of quantumness in ratio to the total amount of quantumness lost previously and thus quantifies the memory ability of the environment .",
    "it is clear that @xmath54 is bounded from zero to unit , such that @xmath55 when the system continuously loses its quantumness , and @xmath56 when the quantumness of system is fully recovered to its initial value .     as a function of bath field @xmath12 for the spin bath of @xmath57 at different temperatures .",

    "[ fig : fig2](a )",

    "[ fig : fig2](a ) that when the temperature @xmath24 is low ( @xmath59 and @xmath62 ) the non - markovianity decreases sharply near the critical point @xmath63 . as the temperature increases , the non - markovianity near the critical point decreases further and will go to zero at higher temperature .",

    "it is also noted that the non - markovianity with finite sized spin bath may not be zero at the critical point , which means that the dynamics is not exactly markovian and certain revivals of quantumness is still allowed . in spite of the finite size effect , the non - markovianity in the critical region is the most sensitive to the growth of bath size . to show this ,",
