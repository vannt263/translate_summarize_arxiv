    "to present a global panorama of the dynamics of a system by plotting poincar maps has a long tradition for two degrees of freedom ( 2-dof ) systems where these maps live on a 2 dimensional domain ( for a good explanation of the idea of poincar maps see chapter 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately things are not so easy for more degrees of freedom . already for 3-dof",
    "the domain of the poincar map has dimension 4 and a graphical representation of the map is impossible .",
    "however , such 4 dimensional maps usually have the property that there are 2 dimensional invariant surfaces in the domain , i.e. surfaces with the property that initial conditions on these lower dimensional surfaces lead to trajectories which lie completely in this lower dimensional surface .",
    "and then it is easy to present graphically the restriction of the map to any one of such surfaces .",
    "such restricted 2 dimensional maps are a great help to understand important properties of the full 4 dimensional map .    to be useful such 2 dimensional invariant surfaces must have some kind of robustness property , i.e. they must survive parameter changes such that we can follow the perturbation scenario in the restricted map .",
    "there are two types of surfaces with this property .",
    "first , the so called normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds ( abbreviated nhims , for their general properties see @xcite ) , however , it seems that these objects do not play any important role in our present galaxy model .",
    "second , lower dimensional surfaces may be invariant because of symmetry reasons , and in the present galaxy model there are various surfaces of this type which will be very useful in the following .",
    "a further contribution to the understanding of 4 dimensional maps comes from a possible partially integrable limit case of the full system and from the corresponding possibility to build up the 4 dimensional map as stack of 2 dimensional reduced maps . because of its importance for",
    "the present work let us give a short summary of the stack construction in a form appropriate for the case found in the dynamics of the galactic potential .",
    "assume a hamiltonian 3-dof system where the unperturbed case has a rotational symmetry around the @xmath0-axis and where correspondingly @xmath1 , the @xmath0-component of the angular momentum , is conserved .",
    "then the unperturbed system can be reduced to a 2-dof system which depends parametrically on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to a 1 parameter family of reduced poincar maps each one acting on a 2 dimensional domain . from the reduced maps we obtain the non - reduced poincar map acting on its 4 dimensional domain in a two step process",
    "first , we pile up the continuum of 2 dimensional reduced maps to a 3 dimensional stack where @xmath1 acts as stack parameter .",
    "second , we form the cartesian product of this pile with a circle representing the cyclic angle canonically conjugate to the conserved quantity @xmath1 .",
    "the result is a 4 dimensional construction .",
    "the full 4 dimensional poincar map ( still for the unperturbed case ) acts on the resulting 4 dimensional domain as reduced map in each invariant horizontal leaf of constant @xmath1 and in addition applies a rotation to each copy of the circle .",
    "if we now add a perturbation which destroys the rotational symmetry around the @xmath0 axis then the invariant foliation into the horizontal leaves is destroyed .",
    "however , if the perturbation conserves some discrete symmetry then the 4 dimensional map will have corresponding invariant 2 dimensional surfaces @xmath2 also after the perturbation .",
    "these 2 dimensional surfaces do not coincide with any one of the invariant 2 dimensional horizontal leaves of the unperturbed stack , they are transverse to the stack structure .",
    "most important , the dynamics restricted to @xmath2 is sensitive to the perturbation and can be exploited to obtain an understanding of the perturbation scenario for the full 3-dof system .",
    "the restricted map on @xmath2 visualizes the decay of the stack structure under the perturbation .",
    "the idea works the same if the role of @xmath2 is taken over by a nhim . for all details of this approach and for examples of the stack construction",
    "see @xcite . for",
    "the analysis of a 3-dof molecular system taking advantage of this procedure see @xcite .",
    "the present article shows that the method is equally successful for the investigation of the dynamics of a 3-dof galaxy model .    in order to explore the orbital dynamics of galaxies",
    "one should build first suitable models describing sufficiently and realistically the properties of the galaxy .",
    "usually observations provide the necessary information on the construction of the dynamical models .",
    "a galactic model can be characterized as successful and realistic only if the derived results agree with the corresponding observational data . in most of the cases , the galaxy models are either spherical or axially symmetric .",
    "for instance , in a spherically symmetric potential all three components of the angular momentum and of course the total angular momentum are conserved .",
    "therefore , the motion of the stars is plane and takes place in the plane perpendicular to the vector of the total angular momentum .",
    "spherically symmetric models for galaxies were studied by @xcite . in an axially symmetric potential on the other hand ,",
    "only the @xmath0 component of the total angular momentum is conserved . many previous papers are devoted to the distinction between order and chaos in axially symmetric potentials ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , axially symmetric galaxy models were presented and examined in @xcite .",
    "another interesting category of galactic potentials are the so - called composite galaxy models . in those models",
    "the potential is multi - component and each component describes a different part of the system .",
    "composite axially symmetric galaxy models describing the motion of stars in our galaxy were also studied by @xcite . in these models the gravitational potential is composed by three superposed disks : one representing the gas layer , one the thin disk and one for the thick disk . recently in @xcite , a class of realistic triaxial models for galaxies was provided . in particular",
    ", the authors extended an earlier method proposed by @xcite to three - dimensional systems by replacing the radial with an ellipsoidal symmetry in the total mass density .",
    "moreover , triaxial galaxy models were also constructed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : section [ galmod ] , contains a detailed presentation of the structure and the properties of our galactic gravitational model . in section [ numres ] ,",
    "we construct poincar maps in order to investigate the orbital properties of the 6 dimensional phase space .",
    "the paper ends with section [ disc ] , where the discussion and the main conclusions of our numerical analysis are presented .",
    "the total gravitational potential @xmath3 is three - dimensional and it consists of three components : a central , spherical component @xmath4 , a flat disk @xmath5 and a triaxial dark matter halo potential @xmath6 .",
    "the spherically symmetric nucleus is modeled by a plummer potential @xcite @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mass and the scale length of the nucleus , respectively . here",
    "we must point out , that potential ( [ vn ] ) is not intended to represent a black hole nor any other compact object , but a dense and massive bulge .",
    "therefore , we do nt include any relativistic effects .    in order to model the disk we use the miyamoto - nagai potential @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the disk , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the horizontal and vertical scale lengths of the disk .",
    "for the description of the properties of the dark matter halo we use the logarithmic potential @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the flattening parameters along the @xmath18 and @xmath0 axes , respectively , @xmath19 is the scale length of the halo , while the parameter @xmath20 is used for the consistency of the galactic units .",
    "the choice for the logarithmic potential was motivated for several reasons : ( i ) it can model a wide variety of shapes of galactic haloes by suitably choosing the parameter @xmath17 . in particular , when @xmath21 the dark matter halo is prolate , when @xmath22 is spherical , while when @xmath23 is oblate ; ( ii ) it is appropriate for the description of motion in a dark matter halo as it produces a flat rotation curve at large radii ( see fig .",
    "[ rotvel ] ) ; ( iii ) it allows for the investigation of flattened configurations of the galactic halo at low computational costs ; ( iv ) the relatively small number of input parameters of eq .",
    "( [ vh ] ) is an advantage concerning the performance and speed of the numerical model ; and ( v ) the flattened logarithmic potential was utilized successfully in previous works to model a dark matter halo component ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use a system of galactic units , where the unit of length is 1 kpc , the unit of mass is @xmath24 ( solar masses ) and the unit of time is @xmath25 yr ( about 100 myr ) .",
    "the velocity units is 10 km / s , the unit of angular momentum ( per unit mass ) is 10 km kpc s@xmath26 , while @xmath8 is equal to unity .",
    "the energy unit ( per unit mass ) is 100 km@xmath27s@xmath28 . in these units ,",
    "the values of the involved parameters are : @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are treated as variable parameters in the intervals @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the values of the disk and the nucleus were chosen with a milky way - type galaxy in mind ( e.g. , @xcite ) and they secure positive density everywhere . here we must point out that our total gravitational potential is truncated at @xmath38 kpc , otherwise the total mass of the galaxy modeled by this potential is infinite which of course lacks of physical meaning .        for @xmath39",
    "the total gravitational potential @xmath3 becomes axially symmetric @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and the @xmath0-component of the angular momentum is conserved .",
    "one of the most important quantities in disk galaxies is the circular velocity in the galactic plane which is defined as , @xmath42 a plot of @xmath43 for our galactic model , so the rotation curve is the same regardless of the particular value of @xmath17 . ]",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ rotvel ] as a black curve .",
    "moreover , in the same plot , the red line shows the contribution from the spherical nucleus , the green curve is the contribution from the disk , while the blue line corresponds to the contribution form the dark matter halo .",
    "it is seen that each contribution prevails in different distances form the galactic center . in particular , at small distances when @xmath44 kpc , the contribution from the spherical nucleus dominates , while at mediocre distances , @xmath45 kpc , the disk contribution is the dominant factor . on the other hand , at large enough galactocentric distances , @xmath46 kpc , we see that the contribution from the dark halo prevails , thus forcing the rotation curve to remain flat with increasing distance from the center .",
    "we also observe the characteristic local minimum of the rotation curve due to the massive nucleus , which appears when fitting observed data to a galactic model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of motion for a test particle with a unit mass @xmath47 are @xmath48 where , as usual , the dot indicates derivative with respect to the time .",
    "the hamiltonian for the total potential @xmath3 reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the momenta per unit mass conjugate to @xmath53 , @xmath18 and @xmath0 , respectively , while @xmath54 is the numerical value of the hamiltonian , which is conserved .",
    "it is rather obvious what is the appropriate partially integrable limiting case of our galaxy model .",
    "it is the rotationally symmetric case with @xmath39 .",
    "then in cylindrical coordinates @xmath55 the potential is independent of @xmath56 and correspondingly the canonically conjugate action @xmath1 , the @xmath0 component of the total angular momentum , is conserved . and",
    "we have a foliation of the system into leaves of constant @xmath1 .",
    "first we treat the case of @xmath57 and @xmath58 in all detail and we give short remarks on other values of these two quantities later . here , we have to point out that the energy level controls the size of the maps and particularly @xmath59 which is the maximum possible value of the @xmath53 coordinate .",
    "we chose that energy level which yields @xmath60 kpc .    from the functional form of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) it is also easy to see that the surfaces @xmath61 given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 given by @xmath64 , and @xmath65 given by @xmath66 are invariant . any initial condition starting in one of these surfaces leads to a trajectory which lies entirely in the respective surface .",
    "now we come to the question which intersection condition to use for the poincar map",
    ". it must be an intersection condition which is appropriate to investigate the restricted dynamics in the surfaces @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath65 and it must also be appropriate for the stack construction in the symmetric case . the best intersection condition we found fulfilling all these side conditions is the condition that the cylindrical radius @xmath67 is maximal , or equivalently that its conjugate momentum @xmath68 changes from positive to negative . the 4 dimensional poincar map generated with this intersection condition will be called @xmath69 in the following",
    ". the restrictions of this map to the invariant surfaces @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath65 will be called @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . as in most cases for realistic systems the transversality of the intersection condition is violated for a few important trajectories . in our case",
    "these trajectories include two simple ones .",
    "first the trajectory @xmath73 which oscillates up and down along the z - axis with @xmath67 constantly zero . and second , in the symmetric case the trajectory @xmath74 which encircles the origin in a circle with constant value of @xmath67 and in the plane @xmath75 .",
    "as we will see later these periodic trajectories appear in some restricted maps as energetic boundaries .",
    "next we explain the stack idea in detail .",
    "consider the symmetric case with @xmath39 , where in cylindrical coordinates the coordinate @xmath56 does not appear in the hamiltonian and where @xmath1 is conserved and correspondingly can be treated as if it would be a parameter . because of the rotational symmetry the angle @xmath56 will be ignored for the moment .",
    "then we have a foliation of the phase space and also of the domain of the poincar map into invariant leaves belonging to the various values of @xmath1 and each leaf can be treated as independent dynamical system .",
    "the reduced system is 2-dof ( @xmath67 and @xmath0 degrees of freedom ) and its reduced poincar map ( called @xmath76 in the following ) acts on the 2 dimensional domain with the coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ map1 ] we show the numerical plots of @xmath76 for the examples of the @xmath1 values 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , and 150 in parts ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) , respectively . we observe that with increasing value of @xmath1 the domain of the reduced map shrinks and the map becomes more regular . for the value 160 of the total energy @xmath54",
    "the maximal possible value of @xmath1 is found as @xmath77 and when @xmath1 converges to this value from below then the domain of the reduced map shrinks to a single point , the origin . and",
    "in this limit case this single point represents the periodic trajectory @xmath74 . fig .",
    "[ chaos ] shows the relative fraction of area covered by chaotic trajectories as function of @xmath1 .",
    "it demonstrates in a quantitative form how this fraction converges to 0 for increasing value of @xmath1 . for the determination of the chaotic percentage we used an image processing numerical method which is explained in the appendix",
    "of course , there are also corresponding leaves with negative values of @xmath1 and the opposite orientation of rotation around the @xmath0-axis .",
    "however , because the hamiltonian is even in @xmath1 these cases are nothing new and only are mirror images of the cases with positive values of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , there is no need to show numerical examples for negative values of @xmath1 .     when @xmath39 and @xmath58 . ]     as a function of the angular momentum @xmath1 . ]    for the case of @xmath78 shown in part ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ map1 ] any trajectory moves in a 2 dimensional plane in position space which contains the @xmath0-axis .",
    "in addition for @xmath39 the motion is independent of the angle @xmath56 of this plane .",
    "therefore for @xmath39 and @xmath78 @xmath76 coincides with the maps @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "next we explain how we pile up the stack of reduced systems to represent the 4 dimensional poincar map .",
    "first , imagine that we construct the reduced map for all values of @xmath1 in the interval @xmath79 $ ] and pile up this continuum of 2 dimensional maps to a 3 dimensional stack where the vertical coordinate ( the stack parameter ) is @xmath1 .",
    "second , we form the cartesian product of this stack with a circle representing the cyclic angle @xmath56 .",
    "thereby we arrive at a 4 dimensional object .",
    "the natural coordinates of this object are @xmath0 , @xmath52 , @xmath56 and @xmath1 , i.e. exactly the 4 coordinates of the domain of @xmath69 , i.e. this 4 dimensional object can be identified with the domain of the 4 dimensional poincar map @xmath69 . finally , we have to understand how @xmath69 acts on this construction . in each copy of the @xmath0 - @xmath52 plane the map acts according to @xmath76 for the respective value of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 itself is conserved . and",
    "each copy of the circle suffers a rigid rotation .",
    "[ rot ] shows @xmath80 as function of @xmath1 for the trajectory moving in the equatorial plane @xmath75 . by choosing the equatorial plane",
    "we obtain exactly that twist curve which we need in a moment to understand the perturbed map @xmath72 .",
    "it is only plotted up to a value of @xmath81 since higher values are irrelevant for the real galaxy .",
    "however , the function continues up to @xmath82 where the rotation angle reaches a value around -1.2 . for negative values of @xmath1 the function",
    "should be continued antisymmetrically .",
    "after having reached the global understanding of the 4 dimensional map for @xmath39 we have to study the perturbation scenario of this map , i.e. its behaviour under changes of @xmath16 , or even better we should use @xmath83 as perturbation parameter .",
    "the perturbation has a strong effect , if the @xmath56 dependence of the perturbation comes in resonance with the rotation angle @xmath80 of the unperturbed system . in our case",
    "the perturbation appears in the argument of the logarithm of the halo potential only and in this argument we set @xmath84 in this sense the perturbation consists of a fourier component of order 2 only and has most effect when the rotation angle @xmath80 has values around @xmath85 .",
    "[ rot ] shows , this happens for @xmath1 values around 0 .",
    "therefore the perturbation will have strong effects around @xmath86 also for small values of @xmath87 .",
    "higher order resonance effects are expected to be small for small values of @xmath87 and to become efficient for large values of @xmath87 only .",
    "the next important resonances are a 1:3 resonance for @xmath88 , a 1:4 resonance for @xmath89 and a 3:8 resonance for @xmath90 .",
    "corresponding resonances exist for negative values of @xmath1 .",
    "the perturbation scenario is presented in the most evident form by the restricted map @xmath72 on its domain with coordinates @xmath56 and @xmath1 .",
    "these are the canonical coordinates of the @xmath56 degree of freedom and this degree of freedom is exactly the one which is decoupled from the rest of the system in the symmetric case . in the symmetric case",
    "@xmath72 is very trivial since @xmath1 is conserved and the domain is foliated into the invariant lines of constant @xmath1 ( such lines are circles of the variable @xmath56 , one for each value of @xmath1 ) .",
    "each of these circles is just rigidly shifted by the rotation angle @xmath91 . in this sense",
    "the map @xmath72 for @xmath39 is a pure twist map . under perturbations",
    "any twist maps follows the universal perturbation scenario of the standard map @xcite . for useful information on the interpretation of structures found in poincar maps",
    "see also chapter 4 in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ map2 ] we show 4 examples for the perturbed map @xmath72 . only the part of the domain up to @xmath81 is included in the plot since the model is only realistic up to this value . in principle",
    "the domain goes up to @xmath82 and the natural boundary of the domain is the trajectory @xmath74 .",
    "the plots should be supplemented symmetrically for negative values of @xmath1 .    for the moderate perturbation strength @xmath92 in part ( a ) of the figure",
    "the 1:2 resonance at @xmath78 has already a very large effect , it causes two large secondary islands and a fine chaos strip which reaches up to @xmath1 values around 45 .",
    "the centres of the secondary island are the two points @xmath93 and @xmath94 of an elliptic orbit of period two , and the centres of the chaos strips are the two points @xmath95 and @xmath96 of a hyperbolic orbit of period two .",
    "the fine chaos strip still comes very close to a separatrix curve and it indicates the position of the initial segments of the stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable orbit of period two .",
    "the secondary structure of the 1:3 resonance at @xmath1 values around 110 consists of two distinct island chains of period 3 .",
    "these two different island chains are transformed into each other by the discrete symmetry @xmath97 .",
    "the corresponding chaos strip is extremely fine and not displayed in the figure .",
    "all other secondary structures are still too small to become visible at this perturbation strength .    for @xmath98 in part ( b ) of the figure the secondary structure of the 1:2 resonance has grown to a width in @xmath1 of approximately 70 and its chaos strip has become wider so that it is clearly distinct from a separatrix curve .",
    "further , the fine chaos strip of the 1:3 resonance has become visible and the island chain of the 3:8 resonance has become visible .",
    "however , in total the map still is dominated by regular motion .    for the perturbation @xmath99 in part ( c ) of the figure",
    "the interior of the 1:2 resonance islands has become chaotic on a large fraction of the area . and",
    "we see the fine chaos strip belonging to the 3:8 resonance .",
    "finally in part ( d ) we present the case @xmath100 . here",
    "the 1:2 resonance island has already dissolved into a large chaotic sea with only a few surviving islands inside of the chaotic sea , they come from higher levels of the hierarchy .",
    "in addition the chaos strips of the 3:8 and of the 1:3 resonances have become so wide that we can distinguish them very clearly from separatrix curves . at least for @xmath1 values below 100",
    "the map is now dominated by instability , whereas for large values of @xmath1 it is still mainly integrable . in total",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ map2 ] a perturbation scenario following the standard map as it is expected for any generic perturbed twist map .",
    "it should be emphasized that the dynamics in the surface @xmath65 is independent of @xmath17 and therefore figs .",
    "[ rot ] and [ map2 ] are equally valid for any other value of @xmath17 .",

    "then the direction slowly rotates away from the @xmath18 direction passes through the @xmath53 direction quite rapidly and returns slowly to the @xmath18 direction before making the next rotation of the direction of oscillation .",
    "because it is a chaotic trajectory the rotations of the direction of oscillation occurs irregularly and also the orientation of rotation changes in the long run again and again in an irregular fashion .",
    "when the direction of oscillation lies in the @xmath53 direction this corresponds to a point in the small chaos strip of fig .",

    "for this trajectory along the @xmath0-axis all energy is in the @xmath0 motion and the dynamics along this line is independent of the value of @xmath16 .",

    "so far we have considered the case @xmath58 only . in figs .",
    "[ map4 ] and [ map5 ] we show the plots necessary to understand the cases @xmath22 and @xmath115 .",
    "first we have to remember that the plots of figs . [ rot ] and [ map2 ]",
    "are independent of @xmath17 . in figs .",
    "[ map4 ] and [ map5 ] we show the plots of the map @xmath70 for the various combinations of @xmath16 values of 1 and 1.5 and @xmath17 values of 1 and 1.5 .",
    "remember that the plot of @xmath71 always coincides with the corresponding @xmath70 plot for @xmath39 .",
    "thereby we have the necessary information to understand also the cases @xmath22 and @xmath115 .    before closing this section",
    "we would like to present in fig .",
    "[ orbs3](a - c ) some examples of each of the basic types of regular resonant orbits .",
    "the orbit shown in fig .",
    "[ orbs3]a is a 0:1:1 resonant periodic orbit with initial conditions @xmath116 . a 0:2:1 resonant periodic orbit with initial conditions @xmath117 is given in fig .",
    "[ orbs3]b , while the initial conditions of the 0:3:2 periodic orbit of fig .",
    "[ orbs3]c are @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119 notation we use for the regular orbits is according to @xcite and @xcite , where the ratio of those integers corresponds to the ratio of the main frequencies of the orbit , where main frequency is the frequency of greatest amplitude in each coordinate .",
    "main amplitudes , when having a rational ratio , define the resonances of an orbit . for the periodic orbits of fig .",
    "[ orbs3](a - c ) we have @xmath120 because the trajectories lie in this invariant plane , while from the intersection condition we know that @xmath121 since for this particular situation @xmath51 coincides with @xmath68 and our intersection condition is @xmath109 .",
    "finally the initial value of @xmath18 , which coincides with @xmath67 in this case , has to be calculated by the total energy integral .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are as in fig .",
    "the purpose of the whole work is to obtain knowledge for which parameter values ( here we think of parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 that control the geometry of the dark matter halo ) and for which regions of phase space we have stability and instability and which types of trajectories play an important role .",
    "an inspection of figs .",
    "[ map1 ] , [ map2 ] , [ map3 ] , [ map4 ] , [ map5 ] demonstrates that the 1:2 resonance in the invariant plane @xmath65 ( most clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ map2 ] ) plays the most prominent role .",
    "it depends strongly on @xmath16 but is completely independent of @xmath17 .",
    "this importance is easy to understand since the functional form of the perturbation enforces a 1:2 coupling with the @xmath56 degree of freedom , i.e. the degree of freedom which is decoupled from the rest of the dynamics in the partially integrable limit case .",
    "because the resonance occurs around @xmath78 it mainly affects trajectories passing close to the center of the galaxy . as can be seen from the functional form of the halo potential , the @xmath18 direction ( or the angle values @xmath103 as seen from eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) ) is the one most affected by the perturbation , i.e. by the breaking of the rotational symmetry . with increasing @xmath16 the width of oscillations in @xmath18 direction shrinks .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ map2 ] for moderate values of @xmath16 initial conditions close to @xmath78 and @xmath101 or @xmath102 lead to stable oscillations in @xmath53 direction . on the other hand ,",
    "initial conditions close to @xmath78 and @xmath103 lead to unstable behaviour .",
    "the trajectory first oscillates in @xmath18 direction , then its direction of oscillation rotates and at the same time the angular momentum increases and becomes maximal when the trajectory oscillates in @xmath53 direction .",
    "then the direction of @xmath67 oscillation keeps on rotating while the angular momentum decreases again until it returns to @xmath86 when the direction of @xmath67 oscillation returns to the @xmath18 direction .",
    "this is the behaviour of trajectories in the chaos strip starting from the hyperbolic points @xmath78 , @xmath122 in plot shown in fig .",
    "[ map2 ] . for larger perturbation around @xmath123",
    "the oscillation in @xmath53 direction becomes inverse hyperbolic , see the transition from fig .",
    "[ map2]b over [ map2]c to [ map2]d",
    ". then most motion with small values of @xmath1 becomes unstable .    on the other hand , the parts of fig .",
    "[ map1 ] for larger values of @xmath1 and fig .",
    "[ map2 ] show that motion with large values of @xmath1 always stays stable .",
    "this indicates that the approximately circular motion of the disc around the centre of the galaxy is always stable . for larger values of @xmath16",
    "the secondary stable structures of the 1:3 resonance and the 3:8 resonance become moderate size .",
    "this leads to stable bundles of trajectories in the neighbourhood of the corresponding periodic orbits .",
    "influences of the parameter @xmath17 can only exist for trajectories which go far outside of the galactic plane @xmath75 .",
    "the most extreme case is the trajectory @xmath73 .",
    "[ map4 ] and [ map5 ] suggest the following : remember that the intersection condition is @xmath109 .",
    "then points in figs .",
    "[ map4 ] and [ map5 ] with large values of @xmath52 are trajectories which pass through the maximal value of @xmath67 when at the same time they have a large momentum in @xmath0 direction . and these are trajectories having their major part of the energy in the @xmath0 motion . figs . [ map4 ] and [ map5 ]",
    "indicate that such trajectories are regular for large values of @xmath17 .",
    "the situation is different for small @xmath17 as is evident from fig .",
    "here we have stable islands of moderate size only . and in particular , we see chaos close to the whole boundary .",
    "this indicates that the trajectory @xmath73 has become unstable .",
    "this is understandable : a small @xmath17 allows very wide oscillations in @xmath0 direction , wider than in @xmath53 or @xmath18 directions .",
    "this leads to overfocusing of the trajectory @xmath73 and therefore to inverse hyperbolic behaviour ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to have a more complete view on how energy influences the orbital structure of the dynamical system we constructed additional maps for lower and higher values of the standard @xmath57 level .",
    "our numerical calculations suggest that for low energies , that is the case of local motion around the nucleus , the trajectories do not go out into the dark matter halo and therefore the values of the halo parameters are irrelevant .",
    "whereas for large values of the energy the trajectories go out far and are strongly influenced by geometrical details of the halo .",
    "this work has been supported by dgapa under grant number ig-101113 and by conacyt under grant number 79988 .",
    "the authors would also like to thank the anonymous referee for the careful reading of the manuscript and for all the apt suggestions and comments which allowed us to improve significantly both the quality and the clarity of the paper .",
