    "t2k ( tokai - to - kamioka )  @xcite is a long - baseline off - axis neutrino oscillation experiment that focuses on measuring @xmath4 and @xmath5 in both @xmath6 and @xmath7-modes .",
    "a very pure @xmath8 beam is produced at j - parc accelerator complex and detected 295  km away at the super - kamiokande ( sk )  @xcite far detector .",
    "t2k uses a set of near detectors in order to reduce the large uncertainties on the oscillation parameters that come from the neutrino fluxes and interaction models .",
    "the nd280 off - axis detector  @xcite measures the non - oscillated @xmath8 spectrum , constrains the cross - section models and determines the @xmath9 intrinsic contamination in the beam .",
    "it reduced the uncertainties from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and from @xmath0 to @xmath1 respectively in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels .",
    "however , this systematic uncertainty reduction is limited due to intrinsic detector limitations :    * differences in most of the target material between nd280 ( 80@xmath12 c@xmath13h@xmath13 + 20@xmath12 h@xmath14o ) and sk ( pure h@xmath14o ) .",
    "this leads to using the cross - section model to cover the difference between c@xmath13h@xmath13 and h@xmath14o . * differences in the angular acceptance of nd280 ( mostly foward ) and sk ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the flux and cross - section models are therefore not constrained in the high angle regions .",
    "* inability to reconstruct low momentum protons ( @xmath16 mev / c ) at the near detector .",
    "this leads to a large uncertainty on the interaction of the neutrino with bounded states of 2 protons ( 2p-2h ) and final state interactions ( fsi ) that affect the far detector differently than nd280 due to the different threshold in proton momentum . * differences in the flux at the near and far detector .",
    "figure  [ cpsensitivityt2k ] shows how the current systematic error limits the phase space corresponding to a @xmath17 evidence of cp violation at the t2k phase ii experiment  @xcite . in order to remove the impact of possible statistical fluctuations , mass hierarchy or true value of @xmath18",
    ", we propose to upgrade the nd280 near detectors that will tackle the previously listed issues while keeping the current advantages of the detector .",
    "note that the flux difference will remain but its fractional error is lower than @xmath19 in the oscillation maximum .",
    "this upgrade will also be crucial for observing cp violation at the future hyper - kamiokande experiment with more than @xmath20 confidence level .",

    "reconstruction efficiency as a function of muon angle . ]    two different modules are considered :    * a 2.8  tonne h@xmath14o module to mimic the target of the far detector . a scintillator tracker ( see description below ) is embedded in this module . in the current configuration , the module is comprised of 70@xmath12 h@xmath14o and 30@xmath12 c@xmath13h@xmath13 . *",
    "a 0.9  tonne c@xmath13h@xmath13 module consisting only of scintillators .",
    "it allows the scintillator background in the first module to be substracted .",
    "moreover , a fully active detector is crucial in order to reconstruct low momentum protons .",
    "the central tracker is designed in order to have an excellent reconstruction of large angle tracks to mimic the far detector 4@xmath21 acceptance .",
    "it is constructed by alternating vertically and horizontally aligned scintillator planes for tracking forward going tracks ( similar to the current nd280 ) , with new 3d grid scintillator planes which allow the reconstruction of high angle tracks ( see figure  [ 3dgrid ] ) .",
    "+ the tpcs are responsible for separating @xmath6 and @xmath22 components , identifying the interaction topology and measuring the neutrino energy .",
    "the latter is measured through the identification of the daughter particles via measurement of their charge and kinematics .",
    "the tpcs are only located upstream and downstream of the tracker in the current nd280 which limits the high angle acceptance .",
    "it is therefore proposed to add horizontal tpcs on the top and bottom of the tracker in order to extend their acceptance to @xmath15 for the upgraded detector .",
    "the size of these additional tpcs is tuned coarsely to 80  cm in order to adapt the current tpcs characteristics for the high angle muons that have lower momenta .",
    "the performance of the upgrade detector is established using a reconstruction adapted from the wagasci detector  @xcite .",
    "the water cell size is first optimized to cubic cells of 2.5  cm side in order to keep a high water content while reducing the threshold in particle momenta .",
    "though the detector is not fully active , it ensures that over @xmath23 of the muons above @xmath24  mev / c are reconstructed .",
    "note that the oscillation maximum concerns neutrinos having @xmath25mev .",
    "the new 3d grid ensures a very high reconstruction efficiency ( @xmath26 ) even for large angle muons as shown on figure  [ efficiencyangle ] .",
    "the nd280-upgrade is therefore an ideal detector to cover the sk phase space .",
    "note that since the current nd280 topology is not only based on muon but also on pion identification , it is crucial to ensure an excellent pion reconstruction and identification .",
    "this criterion is currently used for final optimization of the detector size and granularity .",
    "a c@xmath13h@xmath13 detector is needed in order to substract the scintillator background in the water - in module . moreover",
    ", the large contamination of 2p-2h interactions in the ccqe sample leads to a @xmath27 uncertainty in the @xmath9 appearance channel .",
    "the upgrade aims to reduce this uncertainty through separation of these two topologies , using proton counting and kinematics .",
    "however , the water - in detector is unable to reconstruct low momentum protons ( @xmath28mev / c ) which constitutes",

    "consequently , @xmath30 of the protons produced in ccqe and 2p-2h interactions are reconstructed . on top of pure proton counting",
