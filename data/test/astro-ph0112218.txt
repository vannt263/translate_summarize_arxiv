    "cherenkov - drift instability was suggested by kazbegi , machabeli & melikidze @xcite as a possible mechanism for generation of pulsar radio emission and later it was approved in @xcite . in those works the linear theory of cherenkov - drift instability was developed .",
    "it was shown , that in the pulsar magnetosphere due to cherenkov - drift instability the orthogonally polarized plasma waves are excited .",
    "these waves can escape from the magnetosphere and reach observer as a pulsar radio emission .",
    "the necessary condition for the development of cherenkov - drift instability ( as for an usual cherenkov instability ) is a presence of a beam of particles in the relativistic magnetized pair plasma ( consisted of relativistic electrons @xmath0 and positrons @xmath1 ) .",
    "generally , cherenkov type instabilities develop due to a resonant interaction between waves and particles of a beam .",
    "the resonance occurs , when the electric field vector @xmath2 and the wave vector @xmath3 of generated waves have got components along direction of the beam velocity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "so , in the magnetized plasma the transverse waves ( @xmath7 ) propagating along the external magnetic field (  @xmath8  ) can not be generated by an usual cherenkov instability ( because it develops on the beam particles moving along the external straight magnetic field lines : @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "cherenkov - drift instability develops when the beam particles move along slightly curved magnetic field ( scmf ) lines and , hence , drift across the plane where the curved lines lie .",
    "the drift motion of beam particles provokes generation of purely transverse as well as longitudinal - transverse waves .",
    "generally there are two most important effects caused by the the particle relativistic motion along the scmf line : curvature drift and curvature radiation .",
    "the drift velocity is directed across the plane of the scmf lines and is given by the following expression : @xmath11 here @xmath12 denotes the drift velocity of electrons ( positrons drift with the same velocity but in the opposite direction ) ; @xmath13 is the cyclotron frequency of electrons ; @xmath14 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field line ; @xmath15 is lorentz factor of a particle ; @xmath16 is speed of light and @xmath17 is the component of @xmath4 along the magnetic field line .",
    "if @xmath18 , the value of drift velocity @xmath12 could be significant .",
    "a single particle , moving along the curved field line , radiates so called curvature radiation which can be easily described as a synchrotron radiation in an effective magnetic field ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in 1975 blandford @xcite investigated the curvature radiation of plasma flowing along the scmf lines .",
    "the problem was studied in the limit of infinite magnetic field @xmath19 and it was shown that there is no radiation at all : the waves , radiated by each particle , are absorbed by another one .",
    "this result was confirmed later in papers @xcite , where spatially unlimited plasma flow was considered .",
    "then in the paper by asseo , pellat and sol @xcite the sharp boundary was assumed at the edge of the flow propagating along the curved field line and the possibility of the waves excitation was shown at this boundary .",
    "if plasma flow has zero width the instability is reduced to that of goldreich - keeley @xcite .",
    "development of cherenkov type instability , taking into account the curvature drift motion , was studied and growth rate was calculated in @xcite for different particular cases .",
    "these results were confirmed later after thorough investigation of the problem in @xcite . the instability was called a cherenkov - drift instability .",
    "presence of the curved magnetic field lines is the necessary condition for both the cherenkov - drift radiation in plasma and the single particle curvature radiation in vacuum .",
    "however , the cherenkov - drift radiation still could not be interpreted as a plasma curvature radiation , analogous to the single particle curvature radiation : as it will be shown below , the cherenkov - drift radiation is not generated in the case of @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , it is evident that the drift velocity equals to @xmath21 if we assume that @xmath19 .",
    "however a single particle radiates even for the infinite intensity of magnetic field .",
    "moreover , the single particle radiates the vacuum wave , while the proper waves of the medium ( i.e. relativistic electron - positron plasma ) are generated in the case of cherenkov - drift instability .",
    "this particular point was not considered in the works by blandford @xcite and melrose @xcite .",
    "polarization of these waves strongly differs from that of vacuum waves .",
    "brief examination of the linear theory of cherenkov - drift instability is discussed in section 2 . in section 3",
    "the quasilinear equations for the cherenkov - drift instability are obtained . in section 4 coefficients describing diffusion of particles in momentum space",
    "are evaluated .",
    "alteration of plasma distribution function is studied .",
    "the results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "properties of relativistic electron - positron plasma were carefully investigated in series of works @xcite and are still the subject of concern @xcite .",
    "the electron - positron plasma of pulsar magnetosphere consists mainly of two components : a bulk of plasma particles with high density and low lorentz factors ( @xmath22 ) and a beam of the primary particles ejected from the stellar surface .",
    "density of the beam @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is so called goldreich - julian density . density of secondary plasma @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the sturrock multiplication factor ( @xmath27 ) @xcite .",
    "the electron - positron plasma differs from the electron - ion plasma by lack of gyrotropy .",
    "consequently , spectra of waves propagating in the @xmath28 plasma is simpler than that in the electron - ion plasma .",
    "it consists of only four types of waves which correspond to four branches on the diagram @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the wave frequency ( see fig.[spectr ] ) .",
    "one of them is high - frequency transverse electromagnetic wave totally located in superluminal area .",
    "its phase velocity @xmath31 exceeds speed of light @xmath16 , hence , it is not of interest in our discussion below .",
    "the second branch represents the dispersion of purely transverse linearly polarized electromagnetic wave .",
    "we call this dispersion curve @xmath32 mode",
    ". it is totally located in subluminal area and therefore could be generated by beam particles .",
    "its electric field vector @xmath33 is perpendicular to the plane of wave vector and external magnetic field ( @xmath34 ) .    the remaining two dispersion curves on the @xmath35 diagram describes the longitudinal - transverse waves propagating in relativistic @xmath36 plasma .",
    "one of them is almost superluminal .",
    "this wave is purely longitudinal if it propagates strictly along the magnetic field line ( @xmath37 ) , and , in this case called langmuir wave associated with longitudinal oscillations of the charge density .",
    "if an angle @xmath38 between @xmath3 and @xmath39 increases , the component of wave electric field @xmath2 starts to grow across @xmath3 : langmuir wave transforms to the longitudinal - transverse wave denoted in fig.[spectr ] as @xmath40 mode .",
    "if the angle @xmath38 is small enough ( @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the langmuir frequency ) , @xmath40 mode is almost longitudinal and crosses @xmath43 line . in this case",
    ", @xmath40 mode could be excited , if cherenkov resonance condition @xmath44 is fulfilled .",
    "however , for the resonant particles of primary beam , growth rate of the instability is very small @xcite .",
    "the wave leaves from the interaction area so quickly that no time is left for significant growth of the wave amplitude . in the case of oblique propagation , @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath40 mode is totally superluminal .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 mode could not be generated at all by particles of beam .",
    "another longitudinal - transverse wave is denoted in fig.[spectr ] as @xmath46 mode .",
    "this mode , like @xmath32-wave , is located totally in subluminal area and can easily be generated by plasma particles .",
    "its electric field vector @xmath47 is located in ( @xmath34 ) plane .",
    "@xmath46 mode is vacuum wave , if it propagates along the magnetic field lines ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "its dispersion curve merges with @xmath32 mode ( see fig.[spectr ] ) and can be arbitrarily polarized . in the case of oblique propagation , electric field of @xmath46 wave",
    "has the component @xmath49 along the external magnetic field , thereby involving plasma particles in longitudinal oscillations .",
    "generation of @xmath46-mode , propagating in perpendicular direction to the plane of scmf lines , is connected with the drift motion of the particles .",
    "these waves are also known as _ drift waves _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that , while describing the waves in relativistic @xmath50 plasma , some authors sometimes use terminology which , in our opinion , appears to be misleading . for example , since the work by arons and barnard @xcite , the superluminal longitudinal - transverse wave ( @xmath40 mode ) was called an ordinary ( @xmath51 ) mode , the subluminal transverse wave ( @xmath32 mode )  an extraordinary ( @xmath52 ) mode and the subluminal longitudinal - transverse wave ( @xmath46 mode )  an alfven mode . however ordinary and extraordinary are generally related to the waves propagating across the external magnetic field in usual electron - ion plasma @xcite . moreover , @xmath32 wave ( so called @xmath52 mode ) is the purely transverse wave and its analogue does not exist in the electron - ion plasma . in electron - positron plasma",
    "the terminology _ ordinary _ and _ extraordinary _ are used for the waves propagating almost along the magnetic field . as for the alfven mode , in electron - ion plasma such a name is used for an almost linearly polarized , transverse electromagnetic wave with frequency @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the cyclotron frequency of ions ) . in the case of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "this wave transforms into right - hand polarized ion - cyclotron mode with frequency @xmath57 and left - hand polarized electron - cyclotron wave with frequencies @xmath58 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the fast magnetosonic wave and is called _ helicon _ for frequencies @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , in relativistic @xmath36 plasma , we prefer to call the dispersion curves @xmath32 , @xmath40 and @xmath46 modes respectively , hence avoiding a possible confusion with dispersion curves in electron - ion plasma .    to obtain expression for dielectric permittivity tenor components @xmath60 in the case of scmf lines ,",
    "it is handy to consider the problem in cylindrical coordinates @xmath61 @xcite and direct @xmath62 axis perpendicularly to the plane of the curved magnetic field lines ( see fig.[l2 ] ) .        in the papers by kazbegi , machabeli and melikidze @xcite",
    ", it was shown that @xmath32 and @xmath63 waves could be generated by particles of the beam when the following resonance condition is satisfied ( for the resonant values of parameters @xmath64 ) : @xmath65    mechanism of wave generation is a modification of the well - known beam - plasma instability . however , this instability differs significantly from the usual beam - plasma instability @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the growth rates of the different waves are as follows : @xmath66 for transverse ( @xmath32 ) wave and @xmath67 for longitudinal - transverse ( @xmath63 ) wave ( here @xmath68 is langmuir frequency of resonant particles of the beam ) .",
    "these expressions were obtained in papers @xcite . as for growth rate of the drift wave",
    ", it was obtained in paper @xcite : @xmath69    the reason for generation of @xmath32 , @xmath63 and drift waves is presence of the beam in the relativistic pair plasma , although the waves can not be excited without drift motion of particles .",

    "it is worth to note that , in the cherenkov - drift instability , the plateau on the parallel distribution function forms not only due to parallel diffusion of particles ( which transfers energy from high velocity resonant particles to those with low velocities as for usual cherenkov instability ) , but also because of perpendicular diffusion which transfers energy from parallel to perpendicular motion of particles .",
    "this scenario works if the other factors which can balance quasilinear diffusion , are not taken into account .",
    "such factors could be , on the one hand , the radiation reaction force ( acting on synchrotron emitting particle , spiraling in strong magnetic field ) and , on the other hand , the force arising due to particle motion in weekly inhomogeneous field .",
