    "as soon as the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat , atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) revealed high - energy @xmath6-ray emission from a handful of radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( rlnls1s , abdo et al .",
    "2009a , b , c , foschini et al .",
    "2010 ) , we searched for more information about this type of agn . unlike their radio - quiet siblings ,",
    "rlnls1s were poorly observed and studied , probably because they are faint at all wavelengths .",
    "however , some pioneering surveys were carried out by zhou & wang ( 2002 ) , komossa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , whalen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and yuan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the latter comprising 23 rlnls1s with radio loudness at 1.4  ghz greater than 100 .",
    "after the _ fermi _ discovery of high - energy @xmath6  rays , foschini ( 2011 ) performed a study on 76 nls1s ( 46 radio loud , 30 radio quiet ) based on archival data , where there was a clear lack of information in some frequency bands . in particular , only 60% of sources were detected in the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( x - rays ) .    to optimize our efforts , we focussed on a subsample of rlnls1s , mainly characterized by the flat or inverted radio spectral index ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , although we have taken into account also those sources with a single - frequency radio detection and @xmath9  ghz when possible . when the latter measurement was missing , we used any other frequency available .",
    "half of the sources ( 21/42 ) had only one detection at @xmath10  ghz .",
    "after the publication of our work , richards & lister ( 2015 ) observed at 9  ghz one of these sources ( j@xmath11 ) and calculated a spectral index of @xmath12 , which is still matching our requirements . ] .",
    "in addition to what was available in public archives , we obtained new observations with the x - ray satellites _ swift _ ( 25 sources ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( 3 sources ) .",
    "we studied also optical spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , complemented with new observations ( 2 sources ) from the asiago astrophysical observatory ( italy ) . here",
    "we present an extended summary of the paper by foschini et al .",
    "in addition , extensive multifrequency radio observations with high sampling rate of four @xmath6-detected rlnls1s are reported by angelakis et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , while lhteenmki et al .",
    "( in preparation ) is performing a high - frequency ( @xmath13  ghz ) radio survey .",
    "infrared properties ( _ wise _ ) have been analysed in detail by caccianiga et al . ( 2015 ) . the parent population , which comprises the sources with the jet viewed at large angles , was studied by berton et al .",
    "( 2015a ) .      the distributions of masses of the central black holes and the luminosities of the accretion disks",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ massdisk ] , together with a sample of blazars ( fsrqs and bl lac objects ) for comparison .",
    "it is evident that rlnls1s cover a previously unexplored part of that parameter space .",
    "this is crucial in the unification of powerful relativistic jets from stellar - mass black holes and neutron stars to agn , as shown by foschini ( 2014 ) .",
    "we found some interesting observational characteristics of rlnls1s .",
    "about 17% of the sources ( 7/42 ) were detected at mev ",
    "gev energies - ray detection of one source of our sample , j@xmath14 , thus increasing the detection rate to 19% ( 8/42 ) .",
    "three new @xmath6-ray detections of rlnls1s  not included in the present sample  were reported by komossa et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , liao et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , yao et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . ] , with an average spectral index @xmath15 , similar to fsrqs ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we detected about 90% of the sources ( 38/42 ) at x - rays ( kev energies ) , but 3/4 of the undetected objects were never observed at x - rays and we found an upper limit in the rass only .",
    "the x - ray spectral index of rlnls1s is similar to broad - line seyfert 1s ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and in the middle between fsrqs and bl lac objects ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of rlnls1s showed that the x - ray emission could be due to inverse - compton emission either from the relativistic jet ( non thermal ) or the corona of the accretion disk ( thermal ) .",
    "this could explain why the average spectral index is softer than that of fsrqs , where the x - ray emission is dominated by the jet only .",
    "infrared colours are typical of synchrotron emission , although there is a significant overlap with the starburst region in the _ wise _ color - color diagram ( see also caccianiga et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "violent intraday variability  even on hour timescales  has been observed in many sources in the sample at all wavelengths . in some cases , where a dense multiwavelength coverage was available , we observed strong spectral changes in the sed that could be explained by the jet - disk interplay .",
    "radio measurements indicate changes only in the very large baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) core , and in a few cases , when compared to @xmath6-ray lightcurves , suggested a link between the rotation of the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) and the emission at high energy .",
    "the calculated jet power is in the range @xmath21  erg  s@xmath5 , generally lower than blazars , yet consistent if normalised by the mass of the central black hole .",
    "we conclude that rlnls1s are similar to other agn with a powerful relativistic jets .",
    "specifically , they seem to be the low - power tail of the fsrq distribution .",
    "the small number of sources known today is likely due to either their low observed luminosities or an on - off behaviour of the jet .",
    "future observatories with better sensitivities ( e.g. ska , berton et al .",
    "2015b ) , should reveal more sources of this type .",
