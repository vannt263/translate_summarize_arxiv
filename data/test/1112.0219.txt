    "one of the most dramatic progresses in our understanding of nature in the last decade is the establishment of the dark sector of the universe , which was brought by precision cosmological observations .",
    "however , even basic properties  mass and interactions  of dark matter ( dm ) have not been fully understood yet .",
    "numerous experimental efforts to detect dm have been made , and some of the direct detection experiments claim a positive signal that might be originated by dm . the dama / libra and cogent collaborations show an annual modulation of signal events , which can be interpreted as the change of the relative velocity of the detectors against the dm halo . in this conference ,",
    "the long - awaited result of the cresst collaboration was presented , which indicates a significant excess of events  @xcite .",
    "the results of these experiments suggest a light dm field ( @xmath0 gev ) with a relatively large scattering cross - section with nucleons ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) ; see e.g. ,  @xcite . in this talk",
    ", we discuss the scenario of light neutralino dm in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "since the lightest supersymmetric particle is protected by r - parity and thus is stable , the lightest neutralino is a good candidate for dm .",
    "this possibility has been extensively discussed in the prior studies  ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) . in our recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we inspected the compatibility in the mssm parameter space between the light neutralino dm scenario and particle physics constraints such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 meson decays , neutralino production rate , and higgs boson searches . here , we update our analysis with the latest results of the lhc",
    ". we will show that the light neutralino dm scenario that is consistent with the results of dama / libra and cogent comes into disfavour with the latest lhc bounds , especially constraints from the neutral higgs boson search .",
    "what does a light neutralino with mass of around 10 gev require of the mssm parameters ?",
    "the mass of the neutralino is mainly controlled by three parameters , the bino mass @xmath5 , wino mass @xmath6 , and higgsino mass @xmath7 . since two of them , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are related to chargino masses , they must be larger than @xmath8 gev to satisfy their lep mass bounds .",
    "therefore , the only possibility is to take @xmath9 gev to obtain the light neutralino .",
    "consequently , the lightest neutralino in this scenario becomes mostly bino .",
    "the model that we deal with is described by the following nine parameters : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined as the ratio of the two higgs vev s , @xmath12 is the gluino mass , @xmath13 is the universal coefficient for tri - linear scalar couplings , @xmath14 is the cp - odd higgs mass , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the common soft susy breaking masses for squarks and sleptons , respectively .",
    "we scan them to search for the parameter region in which the light neutralino dm scenario is consistent with the particle physics observations .",
    "we assume that the neutralino was thermally produced in the early universe . since such a light particle is overproduced in the thermal process , an efficient annihilation process is necessary to reproduce the correct relic density .",
    "there are two main annihilation processes for light neutralino dm : sfermion mediation and cp - odd higgs mediation .",
    "it is known that the parameter space in which sfermion mediation becomes the main annihilation process can not be consistent with the results suggested by dama / libra , cogent and cresst  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "therefore , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt the higgs mediation process as the main annihilation process . in order to enhance the higgs - mediated annihilation , the following three conditions are required of the model parameters : ( i ) light @xmath17 , ( ii ) small @xmath7 to have a significant amount of higgsino component in the lightest neutralino , and ( iii ) large @xmath18 to enhance the main annihilation process to a @xmath19 pair .",
    "this parameter choice enhances not only the annihilation process but also many flavour physics processes .",
    "in addition , it magnifies the signal of neutral higgs bosons decaying to lepton pairs at hadron colliders .",
    "therefore , one must carefully inspect the compatibility in the parameter choice between the cosmological requirements and the particle physics constraints .",
    "we employ the following flavour physics processes and categorize them into two groups by their parameter dependence :    * * group i : * @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "they essentially depend only on higgs parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath18 . * * group ii : * @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these processes depend not only on the higgs parameters but also on the susy parameters such as @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "group i observables complemetarily constrain the parameter space of @xmath24 and @xmath18 , which are regardless of the detail of the susy parameters  @xcite .",
    "the key observables are @xmath27 and @xmath23 .",
    "we adopt the following values @xmath28 as the allowed range of these observables .",
    "@xmath27 excludes intermediate values of @xmath18 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath23 disfavours larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the allowed parameter region with middle - to - high values of @xmath18 is sharply narrowed by combination of these two constraints . after a numerical scan of the parameters eq .",
    ", we found that the allowed parameter regions form two separated clusters : ( i ) a narrow strip at high @xmath18 ( @xmath29 ) and ( ii ) a low @xmath18 region ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutralino is inversely proportional to @xmath18 , because a lighter neutralino requires a more efficient annihilation process that is enhanced by a large value of @xmath18 . as shown in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , a neutralino with mass lighter than 15 gev is viable only on the high @xmath18 strip .",
    "next , we discuss the neutralino - nucleon scattering cross - section .",
    "dama / libra and cogent suggest relatively large values for the cross - section . in both parameter regions ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) , the neutralino - nucleon scattering process is mediated by higgs bosons , and its parameter dependence is similar to that of the neutralino annihilation process .",
    "consequently , the direct detection cross - section becomes large at the light neutralino region on which a large annihilation cross - section is required .",
    "as shown in the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the parameter choice of the high @xmath18 strip approximately reproduces the results of dama / libra and cogent .",
    "( 16,6 ) ( 0,6 ) ( 8,6 ) ( 14,1.7)xenon100 ( 10.4,4.9)cogent    since the high @xmath18 strip is standing on the edge of the experimental constraints with delicate tune of the model parameters eq .",
    ", it might be easily excluded by an improvement of some of the constraints . here",
    ", we update our previous analysis  @xcite with the latest lhc results .",
    "the bound to the branching ratio of @xmath26 is improved by lhcb with an integrated luminosity of 0.3 fb@xmath31  @xcite , which is constrained to be smaller than @xmath32 at 95 % cl . as shown in the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , this new bound excludes all the points in the high @xmath18 region , which satisfy the higgs mass bounds at lep . another crucial constraint is brought from the search for the neutral higgs bosons decaying to lepton pairs .",
    "the latest results of cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite with an integrated luminosity of around 1 fb@xmath31 shave a large area of the high @xmath18 region , as shown in the right plot in fig .",
