    "bubbles _ or _ superbubbles _ depending on whether the energy source is an isolated massive star or a group of massive stars such as ob associations and young clusters . as a bubble is blown by a single massive star , its size grows up to a few @xmath0 pc before the star explodes , while a superbubble blown by a populous cluster or ob association can grow up to a few @xmath1 pc before exhausting all massive stars .",
    "the formation of a bubble is intimately dependent on the evolution and mass loss history of the central massive star .",
    "massive stars evolve from the main sequence ( ms ) , through a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) or red supergiant ( rsg ) phase , to the wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase before rushing toward the final supernova explosion . along these evolutionary stages ,",
    "a massive star loses mass via tenuous fast ( 1000 - 2500 km  s@xmath2 ) stellar wind during the ms stage , copious slow ( 10 - 50 km  s@xmath2 ) wind during the rsg stage , copious slow or not - so - slow wind at the lbv stage , and fast stellar wind again during the wr stage .",

    "circumstellar bubble_.    the most realistic hydrodynamic modeling of bubbles has been carried out by garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "they take into account the stellar evolution and the mass loss history , forming an interstellar bubble around a ms o star at first and a circumstellar bubble around a wr star at the end .",
    "their models and the most well cited interstellar bubble model by weaver et al .  ( 1977 ) both assume that the fast stellar wind is shocked and forms a contact discontinuity with the dense swept - up shell , and that the thermal pressure of the shocked fast wind drives the expansion of the bubble .",
    "the physical structure of a superbubble can be similar to that of an interstellar bubble , if the fast stellar winds and the supernova ejecta are thermalized and confined in the superbubble interior ( mac low & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "if supernovae occur near a superbubble shell , the impact on the shell will produce signatures similar to a supernova remnant ( snr ) , and the shell will appear as a snr - superbubble hybrid ( chu & mac low 1990 ) .    finally , we note that planetary nebulae ( pne ) are also bubbles , as they are formed by the current fast wind of the central star plowing into the circumstellar material shed by the progenitor via copious slow wind during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post - agb stages , much like the formation of a wr bubble .",
    "the optical morphology of a pn is frequently complicated by the presence of jets and collimated outflows , but the overall bubble structure is still well shown in x - rays , and comparisons between pne and wr bubbles may help us understand both objects .",
    "the different layers of a wind - blown bubble can be observed at different wavelengths : the photoionized swept - up shell is best seen in the h@xmath3 line , the shocked stellar wind can be detected in x - rays , and the interface is best observed in uv or fuv .",

    "why do nt we see more interstellar bubbles around o stars ?",

    "1 ) the presence of interstellar bubbles in these young hii regions is nevertheless clearly illustrated by long - slit echelle spectroscopic observations , in which expanding shell structures around early o stars are detected ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "these expanding shells , centered on concentrations of o stars , often exhibit different brightness in the approaching and receding sides , suggesting that the stars are formed on the surface of a cloud and their bubbles have a `` blister '' structure .",
    "why ca nt the expanding bubbles in n11b and n180b be morphologically identified in h@xmath3 images ?",
    "while the bright background hii region makes it difficult to detect the surface brightness perturbations caused by bubbles , the most important reason is that the swept - up shell is not strongly compressed to raise its emission measure .",
    "the compression of a bubble shell depends on the shocks advancing into the ambient medium . as shown in fig .  1",
    ", the expansion velocities of the bubbles in young hii regions are only 10 - 15 km  s@xmath2 , comparable to or slightly higher than the isothermal sound velocity of the 10@xmath6  k hii region , @xmath710 km  s@xmath2 . therefore , the expanding bubbles hardly compress the ambient medium to produce the density contrast needed to exhibit a ring nebula morphology in h@xmath3 images ( naz et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "interestingly , hi 21-cm line observations frequently detect interstellar bubbles around wr stars with expansion velocities of @xmath710 km  s@xmath2 ( cappa et al .",
    "these interstellar bubbles are consistent with the bubbles seen in the young hii regions n11b and n180b .",
    "as massive stars evolve and lose ionizing power , their interstellar bubbles and ambient medium will recombine and cool .",
    "the isothermal sound velocity of an hi medium is @xmath71 km  s@xmath2 , so the expansion of the interstellar bubbles becomes highly supersonic and causes stronger compression , producing larger contrast between the bubble and the background .",

    "their x - ray spectra ( fig .  2 ) indicate that the hot gas has a major component at temperatures of almost 10@xmath8 k and a minor component at temperatures of @xmath9 k.    no new detections of diffuse x - ray emission from single - star bubbles have been made .",

    "the x - ray image of s308 shows a distinct gap between the outer edge of the x - ray emission and the outer rim of the optical shell ( fig .  3 ) , while the diffuse x - ray emission from ngc6888 reaches all the way to the rim of the optical shell .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of diffuse emission from s308 ( fig .",
    "4 ) is extremely soft , indicating a plasma temperature of only @xmath10 k. the x - ray spectrum of diffuse emission from ngc6888 is also soft , but the plasma temperature is slightly higher at 23 @xmath11 k.    _ chandra _ and",

    "their x - ray spectra , four shown in fig .  4 , are all soft , and their best spectral fits indicate plasma temperatures of 23 @xmath11 k.    it is interesting to compare the physical properties of hot gas among the superbubbles , wr bubbles , and pne . in bubbles blown by a single star the hot gas temperatures are all low , 13 @xmath11 k ,",
    "while in superbubbles blown by large numbers of massive stars the hot gas temperatures are much higher , reaching 10@xmath8 k. the x - ray morphologies of single - star bubbles show limb - brightening , while those of young superbubbles show brighter emission near stars at the center .",
    "these results suggest that the hot gas in superbubbles is dominated by colliding stellar winds in the vicinity of massive stars , while the hot gas in single - star bubbles is generated by shocked fast wind mixing with nebular material .",
    "the mixing of cool nebular material into the hot gas is not simply thermal evaporation , as the observed x - ray luminosities are much lower than those expected from models with thermal conduction at the interface layer .",

    "( 1997 ) in the wr bubble s308 ( fig .  5 ) ; the @xmath1350 km  s@xmath2 component of the nv line is identified as originating from the interface on the approaching side of the bubble .",
    "it is evident that the sii absorption originates from low - ionization gas along the line of sight , and that civ , peaking at the same velocity , is most likely photoionized unlike nv which is collisionally ionized .",
    "the _ far uv spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ opened up a new window to observe the interface  the ovi lines .",
    "the two wr bubbles with known diffuse x - ray emission provide the best laboratory to study interfaces .",
    "_ fuse _ observations of the ovi emission and _ hst _ long - slit stis observations of the nv emission may spatially resolve the temperature structure of the interfaces .",
