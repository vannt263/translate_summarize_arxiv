    "chiral symmetry plays an essential role in particle physics . in qcd",
    "it is a global symmetry which forbids an additive quark mass renormalization and whose spontaneous breakdown provides us with ( nearly ) goldstone bosons with their specific interactions .    on the other hand , in electroweak interactions",
    "chiral symmetry plays an even more fundamental role : it is a local gauged symmetry .",
    "its presence is necessary to provide a renormalizable theory .",
    "accordingly , when trying to regularize these theories on the lattice ( which is the only non - perturbative regularization known for gauge theories ) one meets two basic problems . as it is ( or rather _ was _ ) well known one can not realize chiral symmetry exactly on the lattice without sacrificing some even more important principles , like locality or absence of extra physical particles . this is the content of the famous no - go theorem by nielsen and ninomiya @xcite . in wilson s formulation of lattice qcd chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken by an irrelevant term which does not affect the continuum limit .",
    "it causes , however , o@xmath0 lattice artifacts and other unwanted effects at finite lattice spacing .    for the electroweak theory , on the other side , the problem of chiral symmetry on the lattice is a principal one : is it possible to define a chiral gauge theory non - perturbatively ?",
    "this second problem is much more difficult , and assumes that the first one  a solution for global chirality  has been successfully solved .",
    "several ways to solve these problems have been proposed .",
    "these were mostly covered on previous lattice conferences . here",
    "i mention only the domain wall fermions @xcite and the related overlap formalism @xcite . on",
    "can state that these approaches provide a solution to the problem of global chirality .",
    "the numerical results using domain wall fermions @xcite are encouraging . in the overlap formalism also",
    "important steps were made towards the solution of the gauged chiral symmetry ( for references see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it was unclear , however , to what extent are the theoretical constructions used in these approaches necessary , or what is the basic ingredient behind the chiral properties observed . as it became clear recently ,",
    "the basic relation which has to be satisfied to realize chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing , is the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) relation @xcite suggested a long time ago !    in this talk",
    "i shall concentrate on the role of the gw relation and its consequences .",
    "some of the results were obtained earlier in the approaches mentioned above , but even these are more transparent within the new framework .",
    "consider the free fermionic action @xmath1 describing a massless fermion on the lattice .",
    "( colour , dirac and flavour indices are suppressed . )    the desirable properties of the dirac operator @xmath2 should be    * @xmath3 is local ( bounded by @xmath4 ) * @xmath5 for @xmath6 * @xmath7 is invertible for @xmath8 ( no massless doublers ) * @xmath9    here @xmath7 is the fourier transform of @xmath3 .    the theorem by nielsen and ninomiya @xcite states that properties ( a)-(d ) can not hold simultaneously .",
    "following wilson , to avoid the massless doublers present in the naive discretization of the dirac operator , one introduces a chiral symmetry breaking , irrelevant operator .",
    "the corresponding wilson - dirac operator is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the forward ( backward ) lattice derivative .",
    "due to the explicit breaking of chiral invariance , however , some extra problems appear :    \\(1 ) chiral symmetry is broken at finite lattice spacing by o(@xmath13 ) lattice artifacts and it is recovered only in the continuum limit .",
    "\\(2 ) one has to fine tune the bare quark mass since there is an additive quark mass renormalization .",
    "\\(3 ) operators of different chiral representations get mixed , etc .",
    "one of the conditions of the no - go theorem was locality .",
    "the natural definition ( used here ) is that the dirac operator in an arbitrary gauge field background falls off exponentially i.e. satisfies the bound @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent of the gauge field @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , it is also assumed that @xmath18 depends negligibly on @xmath17 s far apart from @xmath19 and @xmath20 , i.e. that @xmath21 also falls exponentially in @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is generally assumed that such interactions satisfy universality .",
    "note that it is physically too restrictive to consider only nearest neighbour interactions or even those with strictly finite support . in a real system",
    "the interaction coefficients die away exponentially rather then having a finite number of strictly nonzero terms .    on the other hand ,",
    "interactions decreasing more slowly then exponentially should be considered as non - local and non - acceptable , since universality is not expected to hold for these",
    ". some non - local interaction can give the same correlations as a local one ( e.g. when a bad rg transformation is used , or when some physical fields are integrated out ) .",
    "this is , however , no sufficient excuse to use them  a slight change in the interaction could modify the picture drastically .",
    "theoretically any decay rate @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ bd ] ) is allowed . in practice , however , one works at finite lattice spacing and @xmath26 must hold .",
    "for that reason it is important to have a sufficiently small interaction range .    in principle",
    "it could happen that the decay rate of @xmath18 is not uniformly bounded by an exponential , but there exists a bound @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) .",
    "in general , such interactions should be considered non - local .",
    "however , it may happen that those configurations when @xmath29 are so strongly suppressed that they practically ` never ' occur in a mc simulation .",
    "this is a potentially dangerous possibility , but could perhaps be accepted with extra caution .",
    "back in 1982 ginsparg and wilson @xcite suggested a way to avoid the no - go theorem and preserve consequences of the chiral symmetry .",
    "they suggested to require instead of relation @xmath9 the following milder condition @xmath30 here @xmath13 is the lattice spacing and @xmath31 is a _ local _ operator . for simplicity it will be assumed also that @xmath31 is trivial in dirac indices .",
    "that @xmath31 commutes with @xmath32 follows from eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the locality of @xmath31 expresses the requirement that the propagating states are effectively chiral , so at distances larger than the range of @xmath31 its presence is not felt . obviously , this is a highly nontrivial condition since the propagator @xmath33 on the lhs .",
    "is non - local .",
    "( the coefficient 2 on the rhs . is for historical reasons only . )    accordingly , the dirac operator @xmath2 should satisfy the ginsparg - wilson relation @xmath34    in ref .",
    "@xcite this relation originates from rg considerations applied to the free fermionic action and has been generalized to fermions in a gauge field .",
    "the local operator @xmath31 comes from a chiral symmetry breaking term in the _ block transformation _ only , not from the original action of the rg procedure .",
    "for that reason the physics described by @xmath2 is expected to be chirally invariant .",
    "( for a chirally symmetric block transformation @xmath2 becomes chirally invariant but non - local , in accordance with the no - go theorem . )",
    "two comments are in order here :    \\(1 ) the naive commutation property for @xmath2 is recovered in the continuum limit @xmath35 .",
    "\\(2 ) the rhs . of eq .  (",
    "[ 2 ] ) is zero on solutions , i.e. for @xmath36 .",
    "ginsparg and wilson suggested that a solution to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is the _",
    "mildest _ way to break chiral invariance : it should maintain the physical consequences of chiral invariance ( soft pion theorem , etc . ) .",
    "however , no solution was found for the interacting case ( qcd ) , and the paper has been practically forgotten for 15 years !    last year peter hasenfratz realized @xcite that the fixed point ( fp ) action ( or classically perfect action ) for qcd @xcite satisfies the gw relation .",
    "this observation revived the interest in this relation .",
    "let me recall the definition of the fp action .",
    "for the pure gauge part of the action one has the saddle point ( i.e. classical ) equation @xmath37 here the gauge field @xmath38 lives on the coarse lattice , @xmath17 on the fine one , and @xmath39 is the blocking kernel .",
    "this is a recursive definition , but its recursive evaluation converges rapidly since the minimizing field @xmath40 is much smoother than the original @xmath38 .    in the classical approximation",
    "the fermionic part remains quadratic , and the corresponding propagator satisfies the recursion relation @xmath41 here @xmath42 label the sites on the coarse lattice , @xmath43 on the fine lattice , while on the rhs .",
    "@xmath40 , the minimizing configuration of the pure gauge problem is taken .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath44 comes from the chiral breaking term in the blocking kernel for fermions ; @xmath45 characterizes the averaging procedure for the fermions in rg transformation ",
    "it is assumed to be trivial in dirac indices and usually it only extends over the hypercube .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) recursively and using the fact that the original @xmath2 ( in the continuum ) anti - commutes with @xmath32 , it is easy to see that @xmath46 satisfies eq .  ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath47 ( in fact , for the rg transformation used , @xmath48 or it lives on the hypercube , i.e. is even ultra - local . )    in ref .",
    "@xcite hasenfratz has demonstrated that , indeed , the gw relation implies the chiral ward identities .",
    "the argument is the following : when the symmetry breaking part appears in some expressions ( integrated out in fermionic fields ) @xmath49 then the @xmath33 factors from contractions of the fermionic fields are cancelled by the @xmath2 s on both sides in the breaking term , leaving only the local operator @xmath31 . as a consequence , the symmetry relation @xmath50 is satisfied up to a contact term  i.e. one obtains the ward identities . in this paper",
    "it has also been shown that the proper order parameter for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is given by @xmath51 it has been proven as well that the current is not renormalized ( @xmath52 ) and operators in different chiral representations do not mix .",
    "i shall discuss these issues later , in the light of newer developments .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that there is an exact atiyah - singer index theorem on the lattice , and the fermionic spectrum ( in arbitrary gauge background ) has nice chiral properties .",
    "the discussion was based on the fp action , but it used mostly only the gw relation to establish these facts .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the domain wall and the related overlap formalism also produced dirac operators with nice chiral properties .",
    "neuberger @xcite has pointed out that the dirac operator obtained earlier @xcite also satisfies the gw relation . to be on more general ground ,",
    "i discuss first the overlap dirac operator .",

    "\\(4 ) for @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ) one has @xmath73 which satisfies a slightly modified relation @xmath74 the choice of @xmath75 will be useful as discussed later .",
    "note that for @xmath76 there are no massless fermions at all , while for @xmath77 there are too many , since the modes around @xmath78 ( the massive doublers ) also become massless modes of @xmath2 .",

    "obviously , @xmath93 is topological invariant : an unpaired eigenvalue at @xmath89 can not be continuously produced or destroyed .    in the lattice formulation one",

    "there are several ways to assign @xmath94 to a given gauge configuration ( field theoretical definition , geometrical definition ) . to avoid ambiguities for strongly fluctuating gauge fields ,",

    "however , for a small instanton , or a typical mc configuration ( say at @xmath103 ) there are a lot of small real eigenvalues . therefore the definition of topological charge based on investigating the spectrum of @xmath54 is quite ambiguous @xcite .",

    "there are three types of eigenvalues    * @xmath89 , with @xmath113 ( denote their numbers by @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , * @xmath114 , with @xmath113 ( with multiplicities @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) , * @xmath117 complex , with @xmath118 and @xmath119    note that @xcite since @xmath120 the index of @xmath2 and @xmath121 is opposite : @xmath122    define the topological charge density by @xmath123 for the topological charge @xmath124 we have @xmath125 here we have used the properties of eigenvectors of @xmath2 listed above .    obviously , @xmath126 is topological invariant since the integer @xmath93 can not change smoothly .",
    "this fact can also be obtained directly from the gw relation .",
    "equation ( [ 28 ] ) is the index theorem on the lattice : it states that one can define a ( gauge invariant , real ) topological charge density @xmath127 on a given gauge configuration which leads to an integer topological charge .",
    "the topological charge defined this way equals to the index of @xmath2 .",
    "both sides are defined through @xmath2 .",
    "is this a tautology ?",
    "no : the important point here is that one has a local topological charge density not just an integer number defining the charge .    it is easy to see that for smooth configurations @xmath128 since @xmath129 is a gauge invariant , pseudoscalar , dimension 4 operator and the prefactor is fixed by the fact that in the continuum limit @xmath35 one should recover the continuum topological charge .",
    "i would like to stress that _ any acceptable _ solution to the gw relation defines a topological charge for which the exact index theorem holds .",
    "note , however , that different solutions will give , in general , different values for the topological charge  they need to agree only for sufficiently smooth configurations .",
    "from a practical point of view the operator @xmath2 has to provide a topological charge which is robust enough , giving a reasonable answer also for relatively rough configurations . to illustrate this point , consider neuberger s operator in eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) with a small @xmath130 , say @xmath131 . for this choice",
    "only very large instantons are counted as such when defined through eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] )  perhaps only those with @xmath132 .",
    "smaller instantons `` fall through the lattice '' since the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath54 would shift beyond @xmath130 . obviously , this would be a bad dirac operator and a bad topological charge  in spite of the fact that they satisfy the exact index theorem , eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "any _ acceptable _ discretization of the dirac operator ( without requiring to be a solution to the gw relation ) could be used to determine the correct topological charge for _ sufficiently small _",
    "lattice spacing @xmath13 ",
    "the exactly zero eigenvalue of the continuum dirac operator will move only slightly away from zero , remaining real , and no other nearly zero eigenvalues will appear .",
    "the extra requirement of gw relation forbids the eigenvalue to move away from zero for such configurations .",
    "hence no extra conditions ( beyond acceptability and gw relation ) are required for the index theorem to hold . however , as pointed out above , these conditions do not guarantee that the topological charge defined this way is the ` correct ' one  except for sufficiently large instantons .",
    "of course , there is no unique way to define the topological charge on the lattice , but for not - too - small instantons ( with a radius of a few lattice spacing , say ) the geometrical definition is natural . for practical reasons , one would like to have a gw dirac operator @xmath2 which reproduces the natural topological charge of not too large instantons as well .",
    "i discuss these points perhaps more than necessary , because there is some controversy in the literature @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has also been shown that for the fp dirac operator one has in addition @xmath133 i.e. the topological charge defined by @xmath134 _ coincides _ with the old definition in pure gauge theory . in this case , for example , there are no dislocations , and one expects small lattice artifacts .",
    "an important point is that @xmath18 is discontinuous in the gauge field .",
    "the reason is that on the lattice one can connect continuously any two configurations , but @xmath135 has a jump on the path connecting , say , @xmath136 and 1 .    with the fp action",
    "the origin of this discontinuity is that the minimizing configuration @xmath137 becomes ambiguous when the rhs . of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) has a degenerate minimum ( when the instanton `` falls through the lattice '' ) . for neuberger s dirac operator",
    "the discontinuity appears when a real eigenvalue of @xmath54 passes 1 . in this case",
    "an eigenvalue of @xmath138 changes sign , and @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ 14b ] ) is discontinuous .",
    "note that a similar discontinuity appears when the fermions are defined in the continuum , in a continuous gauge background obtained by interpolating the lattice gauge field @xcite . in this case",
    "the process of interpolation becomes discontinuous , similarly to the situation with the fp action .",
    "an important question : does @xmath2 become non - local when this discontinuity occurs ?",
    "this would be a very bad news for the present approach .",
    "fortunately , this is not true in general . in the fp action",
    "the two solutions @xmath140 and @xmath141 corresponding to the degenerate minima are expected to differ only locally .",
    "neuberger s @xmath2 , as shown by lscher @xcite , remains also local when an isolated eigenvalue of @xmath142 passes zero , so a discontinuity of d does not imply a loss of locality .",
    "restoring the lattice spacing @xmath13 , the spectrum of @xmath2 is given by a circle @xmath143 with @xmath144 , crossing the real axis at @xmath89 and @xmath145 .",
    "correspondingly , the spectrum of @xmath33 is a straight line parallel to the imaginary axis , of the form @xmath146 , @xmath147 for arbitrary gauge field .",
    "denote the unnormalized expectation value of @xmath148 in a fixed gauge background by @xmath149 then we have @xmath150 obviously , the @xmath151 part of @xmath152 is independent of the dynamics and has to be subtracted to define a proper chiral order parameter .",
    "this yields to @xmath153 the same as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    adding a mass term @xmath154 to @xmath2 would shift the whole circle of eigenvalues . since the real eigenvalues at @xmath145 also contribute to chiral relations it is better to leave them unchanged .",
    "this is simply achieved by the replacement @xmath155 which not only shifts the circle but also rescales its radius appropriately . with this definition of @xmath154 one obtains @xmath156 this expression is identical to eq .",

    "whether the chiral symmetry is indeed broken spontaneously in qcd is a delicate dynamical question .",
    "the chiral invariant dirac operator provides a firm basis to investigate this question by avoiding an explicit breaking .",

    "another point worth mentioning is that for the modes with @xmath89 one has @xmath199 while for the modes at @xmath145 they differ in sign , @xmath200 , as seen from the definition eq .",
    ". this observation will be important when we consider chiral fermions .",
    "we can now introduce the @xmath201 parameter , as in the continuum . here",
    "i shall restrict the discussion to some basic points only .    define the lattice lagrangean with a complex mass @xmath154 and the @xmath201-parameter : @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the gauge action and @xmath129 is defined through @xmath2 by eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) . by changing the variables",
    "@xmath204 one can restore the invariance of the action by @xmath205 and the non - invariance of the measure can be compensated by @xmath206 .",
    "therefore the free energy should depend only on the combination @xmath207 , as in the continuum .",
    "one can proceed now e.g. by repeating ( now on the lattice ) the steps of ref .",
    "@xcite where e.g. useful sum rules have been obtained for the spectrum of the dirac operator . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider the partition function @xmath208 under some natural assumptions @xcite one has for the free energy @xmath209 taking then the second derivative with respect to @xmath201 ( for real @xmath154 ) one obtains @xmath210 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ 59 ] ) .    as another example , it is easy to show that the fermion determinant is given by @xmath211 for @xmath212 , and the product is over the complex eigenvalues only . for @xmath213 the prefactor",
    "is replaced by @xmath214 .",
    "( [ 67 ] ) differs from its continuum counterpart by the presence of the factor @xmath215 .",
    "an important consequence of the exact chiral symmetry on the lattice is that there are no o(@xmath13 ) lattice artifacts , to any order of @xmath216 .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the o(@xmath13 ) lattice artifacts of any action could be compensated by adding an extra term which is a lattice version of @xmath217 with an appropriately chosen coefficient @xcite . the original action in our case has the exact ( generalized ) chiral symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) and its artifacts could be compensated only by a similarly invariant extra term .",
    "any lattice regularization of @xmath217 will violate , however , this symmetry , hence the o(@xmath13 ) artifacts should be absent for the original lattice action as well .",
    "note also that the clover term needed for o(@xmath13 ) improvement has been determined by requiring that some ward identity holds independently of the gauge field .",
    "this is , however , automatically satisfied here for @xmath218 hence there is no need for extra clover term .",
    "in addition , in the presence of a mass @xmath154 there are also no o(@xmath219 ) artifacts , if the mass is introduced properly , as in eq .",
    ". then the symmetry @xmath220 forbids such term .",
    "indeed , under a finite chiral transformation @xmath221 @xmath222 is invariant while the mass term @xmath223 changes sign .",
    "although due to the anomaly the partition function is not invariant for @xmath224 , this fact is not relevant for our considerations .",
    "indeed , for @xmath225 and sufficiently large volume one can restrict the system to the topologically trivial sector @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the o(@xmath227 ) lattice artifacts could still be large at the relevant lattice spacings , and could be quite different for different solutions of the gw relation .",
    "finally , it is interesting to see ( although it is not necessary after the previous discussion ) that the absence of o(@xmath13 ) artifacts on the tree level follows directly from the gw relation : expanding @xmath2 in powers of @xmath13 it implies that @xmath228 ( with some constant @xmath229 ) i.e. a term with @xmath230 is automatically generated .",
    "here we shall discuss some basic properties of neuberger s dirac operator and its straightforward generalizations .",
    "consider first the free case .",
    "the spectrum @xmath231 of @xmath2 defined in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] . together with the spectrum for the standard wilson - dirac operator for @xmath232 .",
    "the latter is denoted by w and given by @xmath233 while n denotes the two branches for neuberger s dirac operator where @xmath234 is given by @xmath235 ( note that the lower curve extends only up to the point where the two branches join each other  this peculiar behaviour is due to the non - analyticity in the square root . )",
    "the spectrum for @xmath236 is worse than that for @xmath54 .",
    "this illustrates that a solution of gw relation can have large o(@xmath227 ) artifacts  the fact that @xmath2 is spread over some distance does not necessarily make the artifacts small !",
    "the locality of @xmath2 for the free case is guaranteed by the inequality @xmath237 where @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : loc ] by dashed line .",
    "the decay of @xmath240 for neuberger s @xmath2 is shown by circles .",
    "two more solutions to gw relation are added .",
    "crosses show the case with @xmath241 where @xmath242 is a fp action truncated to the hypercube . since there is a non - trivial @xmath31 in this case the more natural choice , @xmath243 , ( cf .",
    "( [ 16],[16a ] ) ) is also shown ( + signs ) .",
    "finally , the true fp action is also indicated ( triangles ) .",
    "it is obvious that there are rather large differences in the range of interactions for different gw dirac operators , and this is an important factor in making a choice for numerical simulations ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a less trivial point is the question of locality in a gauge field background . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is proven that for small gauge fields @xmath244 , the corresponding @xmath18 is local with exponentially decaying tail , and the localization length is uniformly bounded .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ 74 ] ) should hold sufficiently close to the continuum limit , it is violated at practical values of @xmath13 .",
    "theoretically one can restrict the gauge fields to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ 74 ] ) .",
    "this is sufficient to show that there exists an exactly chiral invariant , acceptable lattice regularization of qcd .",
    "however , the restriction leads to an astronomical correlation length , hence it is only of theoretical interest . as mentioned before , in ref .  @xcite it is also shown that an isolated zero of @xmath245 does not spoil locality .",
    "an important question is the locality in gauge fields generated by mc simulations .",
    "first results on this are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2r ] results from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown , for su(3 ) gauge fields generated at @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 ( triangles , squares , circles ) .",
    "the full symbols are for @xmath249 while the open ones for ( roughly ) optimized values , @xmath250 for @xmath246 and @xmath251 for @xmath252 .",
    "it is also important to have a sufficiently effective way of evaluating the inverse square root .",
    "this issue is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "i only mention here that it seems to be a feasible task but still much has to be done in this direction .",
    "a few comments are in order :    \\(1 ) unlike evaluating @xmath33 for massless quarks , taking the inverse square root is not a critical problem  appearance of zero modes of @xmath245 is accidental .",
    "\\(2 ) starting with a good approximation of the fp action instead of @xmath54 ( as in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) ) the probability to have a zero mode of @xmath245 is strongly suppressed , since with the exact fp action @xmath245 would be unitary .",
    "note , however , that for any continuous parametrization of the fp action , @xmath245 must have a zero mode for specific configurations , when an instanton `` falls through the lattice '' .",
    "this happens on the boundary separating regions of gauge field configurations with different topological charges .",
    "\\(3 ) using a gw dirac operator there will be no `` exceptional configurations '' in the usual sense @xcite  these would correspond to eigenvalues @xmath253 .",
    "( one should distinguish these from configurations where @xmath254 appearing in this approach . )",
    "\\(4 ) one can construct , in principle , configurations when many `` instantons fall through '' simultaneously at different sites of a large lattice .",
    "this would produce a situation when @xmath245 has many nearly zero eigenvalues .",
    "will @xmath2 be local on such configurations ?",
    "one expects that such configurations have negligible weight in the partition function .",
    "will their effect be also negligible ?",
    "i think , these questions have to be investigated .",
    "there are several equivalent ways to measure the topological charge defined by @xmath2 through eqs .",
    "( [ 27],[28 ] ) :    \\(1 ) find the zero eigenmodes of @xmath2 ( or of hermitian @xmath255 ) ,    \\(2 ) count the real eigenvalues of @xmath54 in the region @xmath256 , with chirality signs ,    \\(3 ) trace the `` level crossings '' of @xmath257 while @xmath258 runs from @xmath259 to @xmath130 .",
    "note that although we rely here on the exact index theorem on the lattice , the value of the topological charge determined through @xmath2 with @xmath260 is the same as the method using @xmath54 suggested a long time ago @xcite .",
    "the last method has also been used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the overlap formalism .",
    "this definition of the topological charge works well for small instantons , as expected . but how does it work for typical mc configurations ?",
    "does @xmath2 ( generated using @xmath54 ) give a ` better ' definition than the geometrical one ?",
    "hernandez @xcite argues that the answer is no .",
    "gattringer and hipp @xcite simulated su(2 ) on a @xmath261 lattice at @xmath262 and found that the value of the topological charge , @xmath263 on individual configurations depends strongly on the parameter @xmath130 since there are usually many real eigenvalues in the region of interest , and only very few configurations have a gap in the spectrum where @xmath263 does not depend on @xmath130 chosen in a reasonable range .",
    "they also note that a naive inclusion of the clover term makes the situation worse . the same conclusion is found by degrand , a.  hasenfratz and kovcs @xcite .",
    "this last fact is not too surprising since the corresponding artifact is not an o(@xmath13 ) effect .",
    "note , however , that in the average this definition of charge works better : edwards , heller and narayanan @xcite found that the topological susceptibility stays roughly constant ( independent of @xmath130 ) for @xmath264 . here",
    "i would like to point out that the @xmath130-independence of @xmath265 does not necessarily mean the ` true ' value : if @xmath266 then @xmath267 . a good definition of the topological charge ( at a given lattice spacing ) should give relatively unambiguous definition of @xmath263 on individual configurations .",
    "in other words , the value of the lattice spacing @xmath13 when a gw dirac operator gives a ` good ' definition of the topological charge could strongly depend on the choice of @xmath2 . with the presently used lattice spacings the original choice of neuberger ( using @xmath54 ) seems to produce a topological charge which is too ambiguous .    on the other hand",
    ", measuring the topological charge with the fp action in the schwinger model @xcite gives quite convincing results . for 4d gauge theories ,",
    "however , the situation is less satisfactory @xcite  mostly because of technical problems to perform the required multigrid minimization on the gauge configurations .    for qcd a good strategy would be a compromise : take a dirac operator @xmath64 with good properties ( small cut - off effects , nearly satisfying the gw relation ,  ) and build @xmath2 from it , which in turn could be used in the definition of the topological charge .",
    "it would have smaller o(@xmath227 ) artifacts , better locality , fewer ` dangerous ' configurations , larger gap in the real eigenvalues hence less ambiguity of @xmath126 , but will also need more programming effort and extra computational overhead .    measuring",
    "the topological charge density using @xmath268 is perhaps too time consuming to be feasible .",
    "the question whether it is possible to define chiral gauge theories ( like the standard model ) on the lattice is a purely theoretical problem , but of great importance .",
    "much has been done in this direction and has been reported earlier @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there remain several open questions .",
    "a gw dirac operator seems to be a good starting point : it has exact gauge invariance and one can define weyl fermions ( cf .",
    "( [ 50],[51 ] ) ) . here",
    "i shall report briefly about new developments ( partially yet unpublished ) by lscher @xcite based on the properties of gw dirac operators .",
    "the discussion will touch only a few interesting points which could be easily understood on the basis of previous sections .",
    "consider fermion fields which are purely left handed ( see eq .",
    "( [ 50 ] ) ) @xmath269 these are local , gauge invariant conditions .",
    "introduce a basis for @xmath270 and @xmath271 through relations @xmath272 where @xmath273 and @xmath274 are grassmann variables . in this basis",
    "the fermion action reads @xmath275 with @xmath276 .",
    "the fermion propagator ( when there are no zero modes of @xmath2 ) is given by @xmath277 it is easy to show that this is chiral in the generalized sense .",
    "note that @xmath278 the first term on the rhs .",
    "is chiral in the usual sense ( with @xmath32 ) while @xmath279 is a contact term .",
    "consider a chiral gauge theory with fermion multiplet @xmath280 , with integer charges @xmath281 .",
    "for the number of zero modes @xmath282 , @xmath283 the index theorem implies @xmath284 since @xmath285 is replaced by @xmath286 for smooth gauge fields when @xmath287 .",
    "a simple but important observation is that the number of @xmath181 and @xmath184 fields are not necessarily equal .",
    "they are given by @xmath288 and @xmath289 , respectively .",
    "for their difference we have @xmath290 to illustrate this , consider a background field with @xmath291 , where @xmath292 , @xmath293 and @xmath294 , @xmath295 .",
    "then for the @xmath89 mode @xmath296 while for the eigenvector @xmath297 at @xmath114 @xmath298 according to eqs .",
    "( [ 76]-[78 ] ) , at @xmath89 we have only @xmath181 ( but not @xmath184 ) while at @xmath114 both @xmath181 and @xmath184 are present since @xmath32 and @xmath198 differ by sign at this point . obviously for complex values of @xmath98 both @xmath181 and @xmath184",
    "are present again .",
    "altogether there is one more @xmath181 than @xmath184 .",
    "of course , this statement depends on the topological charge of the gauge field .    as a consequence the fermionic average @xmath299 of any operator in a given background gauge field vanishes unless the fermionic number of type @xmath91 ( the number of @xmath300 s minus the number of @xmath301 s ) in @xmath302 equals to @xmath303 .",
    "perform now ( for the u(1 ) case ) a global gauge transformation @xmath304 .",
    "this modifies @xmath302 by a phase factor @xmath305 where @xmath306 . from the other side a global u(1 )",
    "gauge transformation does not change the gauge fields at all , hence invariance under this transformation requires @xmath307 i.e. the condition of anomaly cancellation of the continuum theory .",
    "these observations , however , constitute only the starting point of a difficult mathematical problem  to find a satisfactory choice of the fermionic integration measure ( `` chiral determinant '' ) , i.e. of the basis @xmath308 .",
    "lscher has proven that it is possible to construct a basis for the u(1 ) case that satisfies the following requirements :    \\(1 ) the fermionic expectation values @xmath309 are smooth functions of @xmath17    \\(2 ) the field equations ( obtained by some change of variables ) are _ local _ : @xmath310 if @xmath20 is far from @xmath311 .",
    "\\(3 ) @xmath309 is gauge invariant if @xmath302 is .",
    "note that the last property may not be necessary to require . in principle , it is possible that after the leading violation of gauge invariance is cancelled by the condition @xmath312 , the rest is small and goes away in the continuum limit , without the need of extra counter terms .",
    "this possibility is based on a simple but surprising result of foerster , nielsen and ninomiya @xcite , who show that gauge invariance on the lattice is robust in the sense that the effect of a sufficiently small violating term vanishes in the continuum limit .",
    "the constructions of the overlap and gauge fixing @xcite formalisms assume this scenario .",
    "it is clear , however , that it is much safer  if possible  to preserve chiral gauge invariance at finite lattice spacing .",
    "it has been illustrated that dirac operators satisfying the gw relation provide an elegant solution to the chirality problem in lattice qcd .",
    "in particular , there is no additive quark mass renormalization , and ward identities , soft pion theorem , etc .",
    "are valid , there are no o(@xmath13 ) artifacts .      for practical implementations of these ideas",
    "new algorithms are needed . that the task is feasible is illustrated by mc calculations in the domain wall approach @xcite which could be considered as a particular approximation to a gw dirac operator .",
