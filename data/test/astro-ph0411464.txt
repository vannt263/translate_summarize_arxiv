    "it appears quite common that observed flux ratios between gravitationally lensed quasar images are difficult to match while image positions can be fitted easily with simple smooth mass models .",
    "@xcite argued these anomalous flux ratios as evidence for substructures in lens galaxies .",
    "if this is true , it serves as a powerful probe of substructures in galactic halos which may not be luminous enough @xcite . for instance",
    ", @xcite concluded that substructures should comprise @xmath1 ( 90% confidence ) of the mass of typical lens galaxies in order to explain flux ratios in several lens systems . since the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model predicts @xmath2 of mass in substructures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they argued that the result strongly supports for the cdm model .",
    "not all anomalous flux ratios can be ascribed to the simpleness of the smooth part of lens potentials @xcite or any propagation effects because the degree of the ( de-)magnification in observations depends on image parities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , a caveat is that the fraction of substructures is in practice a very sensitive function of distances from the halo center : both numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and analytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) clearly demonstrate that substructures preferentially lie in outer parts of dark halos .",
    "this means that very little substructure is projected within the einstein radius , since the einstein radius is usually much smaller than the virial radius of halos .",
    "thus the fraction of substructures in the cdm model appears to be _ smaller _ than that required to explain anomalous flux ratios in gravitational lenses if we take the spatial distribution of substructures into account @xcite .",
    "* see also @xcite ) claimed that the discrepancy may be resolved by considering extragalactic halos along line of sight .",
    "another possible explanation is some contributions from stellar microlensing .",
    "for instance , @xcite took mid - infrared images of b1422 + 231 and pg1115 + 080 , and concluded that the anomalous flux ratio of pg1115 + 080 is likely to be caused by stellar microlensing .    in this _ letter _ , we present a possible alternative route to anomalous flux ratios .",
    "specifically , we consider the compound lens system such that a lens galaxy lies in a group or cluster , and discuss to what extent substructures in the group / cluster could contribute to cause anomalous flux ratios .",
    "although the situation is not universal , recent studies indicate that such compound systems ( including incidence of foreground groups ) appear to be quite common @xcite .",
    "observations imply that many of them lie in groups , and lens systems in clusters are less common .",
    "the effect of correlated matter outside the lens halo was studied by @xcite , however they considered typical field galaxies as lens objects , thus the situation is somewhat different from ours . throughout the letter",
    "we assume a lambda - dominated cosmology with the mass density parameter @xmath3 , the vacuum energy density parameter @xmath4 , the dimensionless hubble constant of @xmath5 , and the rms fluctuation normalization @xmath6 .",
    "the results presented here will be , however , depend little on the specific choice of cosmological parameters .",
    "following @xcite , we compute the fraction of the projected surface density , @xmath7 , to discuss the efficiency of flux anomalies . to do so , we use an analytic model of substructures developed by @xcite .",
    "the model takes account of two dominant dynamical processes that drive dominantly subhalo evolution : one is mass - loss caused by tidal interaction with the host halo , and the other is the orbital decay caused by dynamical friction which drives massive subhalos to the inner part of the host halo .",
    "the model also considers the formation epoch variation of the host halo , and the orbital decay of satellite halos outside the host halo virial radius .",
    "it was shown that the derived analytic distributions agree well with the results of recent high - resolution n - body simulation @xcite .",
    "although the model may be less realistic than semi - analytic approaches @xcite , it has the advantage of being able to compute spatial and mass distributions very easily .",
    "the fraction of the projected surface density @xmath7 is defined by the projected mass in substructures within an annulus with radii @xmath8 and @xmath9 divided by the projected total mass within the annulus .",
    "we choose @xmath8 and @xmath9 so that the annuli are equally spaced in @xmath10 with a step size 0.2 , where @xmath11 is a virial radius of a halo that corresponds to a lens galaxy .",
    "first , we compute @xmath7 in an isolated halo with mass @xmath12 .",
    "the mass inside a cylinder with radius @xmath13 are computed as @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the average density within a sphere of radius @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is an angle with respect to the projection direction .",
    "we can calculate the density profile of substructures @xmath19 and corresponding mass @xmath20 by integrating the distributions of substructures @xcite over the mass of substructures .",
    "then the mass fraction of substructures is @xmath21 where the mass within annuli is denoted as @xmath22 .     for a compound lens .",
    "the projected masses @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are given by equations ( [ eq : mass ] ) , ( [ eq : mh ] ) , and ( [ eq : mhs ] ) , respectively .",
    "[ fig : conf ] ]    next we consider the situation that a lens galaxy lies in a group or cluster . in this case",
    ", the lens galaxy should correspond to a substructure ( hereafter referred as primary substructure ) in a host halo with mass @xmath26 . then to compute the lens potential we have to consider the mass associated the host halo ( group or cluster ) as well as the mass of the substructure . here",
    "we consider the situation that another substructure in the host halo causes anomalous flux ratios in gravitational lenses ( hereafter referred as secondary substructure ) . to quantify this contribution ,",
    "we compute @xmath7 in this compound lens system .",
    "when @xmath13 is much smaller than the virial radius of the host halo , the mass of dark matter and substructures associated with the host halo can be approximated as @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the virial radius of the host halo with mass @xmath26 and @xmath29 being the impact parameter of the primary substructure ( see figure [ fig : conf ] ) .",
    "then the mass fraction from substructures in the host halo is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass associated with the primary substructure calculated from equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) .",
    "although the primary substructure suffers from tidal stripping which makes the size of the substructure smaller , we neglect this because the contribution of the outer part to the mass estimate is quite small .",
    "as a function of projected radius @xmath13 . the fractions of an isolated lens ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : fsub1 ] ] ) and compound lens ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : fsub2 ] ] ) are plotted by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "we assume the lens ( sub-)halo with @xmath32 , the host halo with @xmath33 , the impact parameter of the lens subhalo in the host halo @xmath34 .",
    "they are placed at @xmath35 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines indicate the position of typical lensed images , @xmath36 @xcite . [",
    "fig : fsub ] ]    we calculate @xmath7 in the following setup : the mass of the isolated halo or the primary substructure , which corresponds to the lens object , is @xmath37 . as a redshift",
    ", we choose a typical lens redshift of @xmath35 . for the compound system , we set the mass of the host halo @xmath38 ( i.e. , @xmath39 )",
    ". the virial radii of the lens and host halos are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the primary substructure is placed so that the impact parameter becomes @xmath34 .",
    "the value of the impact parameter is slightly smaller than the average impact parameter calculated from the radial distribution of substructures assuming the ratio of substructure to host halo masses to be @xmath42 ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) , @xmath43 , but is a reasonable value if we take account of the bias due to the convergence of the host halo ( see  [ sec : sum ] ) .",
    "we integrate the mass of substructures in the range @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) to compare our results with those of @xcite .",
    "however , almost universal form of the mass function of substructures @xcite assures that relative amount of @xmath7 between isolated and compound lens systems does not change very much even if we shift the range to lower masses .",
    "figure [ fig : fsub ] shows @xmath7 as a function of the projected radius @xmath13 .",
    "we plot @xmath7 for both isolated compound systems .",
    "we note that for the compound system we show @xmath7 from host group / cluster only : the lens galaxy in group / cluster itself should also have substructures that will increase @xmath7 of the compound lens system further . for the isolated halo ,",
    "we reproduce the result of @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath7 for the compound lens is comparable to , or even higher than , that for the isolated lens at the position of typical lensed images , @xmath36 . to examine",
    "how the result is dependent on our specific setup describe above , in figure [ fig : fsub_par ] we show the dependence of @xmath7 for the compound lens on several parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath7 is quite sensitive to the impact parameter @xmath29 but rather insensitive to other parameters including the mass of the host halo .",
    "therefore we conclude that substructures in the host halo of the compound lens could be a dominant source of anomalous flux ratios when the impact parameter is @xmath46 .",
    "the predicted values , however , are still @xmath47 ( without baryons ) and thus they do not completely eliminate , though do reduce , the discrepancy between predicted and observed fraction of substructures .     for the compound lens on several parameters : the impact parameter @xmath29 ( _ upper left _ ) , the redshift @xmath48 ( _ lower left _ ) , and the mass of the host halo @xmath49 ( _ lower right _ ) .",
    "we change each parameter by fixing the other parameters to the fiducial values .",
    "[ fig : fsub_par ] ]    the expected level of the contribution from substructures in a group / cluster can also be estimated by a simple argument . in our fiducial parameter set , the convergence at image position ( @xmath50 ) is @xmath51 ( assuming a source redshift @xmath52 ) , and the external convergence is @xmath53 . on the other hand , at @xmath54 of a virial radius the fraction of substructures is @xmath55 ( see figure [ fig : fsub ] ) . from these numbers ,",
    "@xmath7 is estimated as @xmath56 the estimated number is roughly consistent with the result presented in figure [ fig : fsub ] .",
    "the external convergence @xmath57 is a strong function of the impact parameter , thus the reason that @xmath58 is sensitive to the impact parameter @xmath29 can be also understood from this expression .",
    "we have examined the impact of lens galaxy environments on substructure lensing . using an analytic model of substructures constructed by @xcite ,",
    "we have computed the fraction of substructures in the situation that a lens galaxy lies in a group or cluster .",
    "specifically , we have regarded a subhalo in a halo as a lens galaxy , and estimated the contribution of other substructures in the halo to the fraction of substructures which determines the efficiency of substructure lensing .",
    "we have found that the fraction depends mainly on the impact parameter of the primary substructure ( lens galaxy ) ; the contribution becomes dominant when the impact parameter is less than @xmath0 of the virial radius of the host halo .",
    "we emphasize that the effect is rather insensitive to the mass of the host halo ; our result suggests that even a poor group could have a great impact on substructure lensing .",
    "therefore we conclude that lens galaxy environments are important when we discuss anomalous flux ratios .",
    "this , in turn , means that lens systems in dense environments may be more desirable sites for detecting dark halo substructures , with either anomalous flux ratios or more direct methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the result appears to contradict with that of @xcite who showed that nearby correlated structure is highly sub - dominant compared to substructure within the lens halo .",
    "however , they assumed average galaxies for lens objects and estimated the number density of clumps outside the lens using two - point correlation function @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the average number density of clumps in the universe .",
    "in contrast , we have assumed rather specific environment such that lens objects correspond to galaxies in a group or cluster , thus the situation is somewhat different from theirs . in our case , it is more appropriate to estimate the number density with the number density of clumps inside the group / cluster , @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the characteristic value of the overdensity of collapsed objects ) , instead of @xmath61 .",
    "this means that the number density of clumps in our situation should be higher by a factor @xmath64 , and this extra factor accounts for the difference between our and their results .",
    "the importance of this new route may be enhanced further if we consider the effect of baryon .",
    "as @xcite noted , the baryon infall makes the density profile of lens galaxies steeper , @xmath65 , and hence substructures will be disrupted more easily .",
    "however , the argument is not applied to compound lens systems because the impact of baryon cooling on groups and clusters is much less significant .",
    ".summary of known environments of lens systems with anomalous flux ratios .",
    "the sample is constructed from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that the anomalous flux ratios of some of these system may be caused by stellar microlensing rather than lensing by substructures.[table : sub ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is important to address how ubiquitous such lens systems are .",
    "@xcite predict that @xmath66 of lens galaxies are in groups or clusters , and @xcite argued that the fraction could be even higher .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite found somewhat smaller environmental effect , it appears that the models predict significantly smaller values for external shear than those obtained by modeling strong lensing data .",
    "in addition , it should be taken into account that anomalous flux ratios have been discussed primarily using quadruple lens systems .",
    "this indicates the sample would be biased significantly toward the higher fraction of the compound systems , because environmental effects enhance the quadruple to double ratio @xcite .",
    "another effect we have to think of is the bias associated with the convergence of the group or cluster which increases lensing cross sections by a factor @xmath67 .",
    "these effects preferentially select compound systems with small impact parameters , indicating that the compound lens system considered in this paper may be quite ubiquitous .",
    "indeed , the survey of environments of lens systems with strong flux anomalies , which is summarized in table [ table : sub ] , shows that more than half of the lens systems lie in groups / clusters , implying a correlation between flux anomalies and dense galaxy environments .",
