    "the study of topological phases of matter is one of the most vibrant directions of research in contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "one core accomplishment has been the theoretical modeling and experimental discovery of two - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "@xcite the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) was an early example of how states could be classified into distinct topological classes using an integer , the chern number , to express the quantized hall conductivity .",
    "@xcite in the iqhe , the number of delocalized edge channels is directly tied to the quantized hall conductivity through the chern number .",
    "more recently , it has been found that the symmetry under reversal of time acts as a protective symmetry for edge modes in ( bulk ) insulators with strong spin - orbit interactions in two and three dimensions ,  @xcite and that these systems are characterized by a @xmath0 topological invariant .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0 topological insulators has triggered a search for a classification of phases of fermionic matter that are distinct by some topological attribute .",
    "for non - interacting electrons , a complete classification , the tenfold way , has been accomplished in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "@xcite in this scheme , three discrete symmetries that act locally in position space  time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , particle - hole symmetry ( phs ) , and chiral or sublattice symmetry ( sls )  play a central role when defining the quantum numbers that identify the topological insulating fermionic phases of matter within one of the ten symmetry classes ( see columns 1 - 3 from table  [ table : main table ] ) .    the tenfold way is believed to be robust to a perturbative treatment of short - ranged electron - electron interactions for the following reasons .",
    "first , the unperturbed ground state in the clean limit and in a closed geometry is non - degenerate and given by the filled bands of a band insulator .",
    "the band gap provides a small expansion parameter , namely the ratio of the characteristic interacting energy scale to the band gap .",
    "second , the quantized topological invariant that characterizes the filled bands , provided its definition and topological character survives the presence of electron - electron interactions as is the case for the symmetry class a in two spatial dimensions , can not change in a perturbative treatment of short - range electron - electron interactions .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , the fate of the tenfold way when electron - electron interactions are strong is rather subtle .",
    "@xcite for example , short - range interactions can drive the system through a topological phase transition at which the energy gap closes ,  @xcite or they may spontaneously break a defining symmetry of the topological phase . even when short - range interactions neither spontaneously break the symmetries nor close the gap , it may be that two phases from the non - interacting tenfold way cease to be distinguishable in the presence of interactions .",
    "in fact , it was shown for the symmetry class bdi in one dimension by fidkowski and kitaev that the non - interacting @xmath1 classification was too fine in that it must be replaced by a @xmath2 classification when generic short - range interactions are allowed . how to construct a counterpart to the tenfold way for interacting fermion ( and boson ) systems",
    "has thus attracted a lot of interest .",
    "@xcite    the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) is the paradigm for a situation by which interactions select topologically ordered ground states of a very different kind than the non - degenerate ground states from the tenfold way . on a closed two - dimensional manifold of genus @xmath3 , interactions can stabilize incompressible many - body ground states with a @xmath3-dependent degeneracy .",
    "excited states in the bulk must then carry fractional quantum numbers ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "such phases of matter , that follow the fqhe paradigm , appear in the literature under different names : fractional topological insulators , long - range entangled phases , topologically ordered phases , or symmetry enriched topological phases . in this paper",
    "we use the terminology long - range entangled ( lre ) phase for all phases with nontrivial @xmath3-dependent ground state degeneracy .",
    "all other phases , i.e. , those that follow the iqhe paradigm , are called short - range entangled ( sre ) phases .",
    "( in doing so , we follow the terminology of ref .  , that differs slightly from the one used in ref .",
    "the latter counts all chiral phases irrespective of their ground state degeneracy as lre . )    while there are nontrivial sre and lre phases in the absence of any symmetry constraint , many sre and lre phases are defined by some protecting symmetry they obey . if this protecting symmetry is broken , the topological attribute of the phase is not well defined any more .",
    "however , there is a sense in which lre phases are more robust than sre phases against a weak breaking of the defining symmetry .",
    "the topological attributes of lre phases are not confined to the boundary in space between two distinct topological realizations of these phases , as they are for sre phases .",
    "they also characterize intrinsic bulk properties such as the existence of gapped deconfined fractionalized excitations . hence , whereas gapless edge states are gapped by any breaking of the defining symmetry , topological bulk properties are robust to a weak breaking of the defining symmetry as long as the characteristic energy scale for this symmetry breaking is small compared to the bulk gap in the lre phase , for a small breaking of the protecting symmetry does not wipe out the gapped deconfined fractionalized bulk excitations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to implement a classification scheme for interacting electronic systems in two spatial dimensions that treats sre and lre phases on equal footing . to this end",
    ", we use a coupled wire construction for each of the symmetry classes from the tenfold way .",
    "this approach has been pioneered in refs .   and for the iqhe and in refs .   and for the fqhe ( see also related work in refs .  ) .",
    "to begin with , non - chiral luttinger liquids are placed in a periodic array of coupled wires . in doing so",
    ", forward - scattering two - body interactions are naturally accounted for within each wire .",
    "we then assume that the back - scattering ( i.e. , tunneling ) within a given wire or between neighboring wires are the dominant energy scales . imposing symmetries constrains these allowed tunnelings .",
    "whether a given arrangement of tunnelings truly gaps out all bulk modes , except for some ungapped edge states on the first and last wire , is verified with the help of a condition that applies to the limit of strong tunneling .",
    "we name this condition the haldane criterion , as it was introduced by haldane in his study of the stability of non - maximally chiral edge states in the quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite we show that , for a proper choice of the tunnelings , all bulk modes are gapped .",
    "moreover , in five out of the ten symmetry classes of the tenfold way , there remain gapless edge states in agreement with the tenfold way .",
    "it is the character of the tunnelings that determines if this wire construction selects a sre or a lre phase .",
    "hence , this construction , predicated as it is on the strong tunneling limit , generalizes the tenfold way for sre phases to lre phases .",
    "it thereby delivers lre phases that have not yet appeared in the literature before .",
    "evidently , this edge - centered classification scheme does not distinguish between lre phases of matter that do not carry protected gapless edge modes at their interfaces .",
    "for example , some fractional , time - reversal - symmetric , incompressible and topological phases of matter can have fractionalized excitations in the bulk , while not supporting protected gapless modes at their boundaries .",
    "@xcite    stated in a slightly more constructive way , we can think of our approach as ( 1 ) fixing , in a first step , a given desired edge theory at the boundary , and ( 2 ) continue , in a second step , by asking whether such an edge can be consistently defined with a set of symmetry - allowed periodic tunneling terms between wires which manage to gap out all other modes . alluding to a related strategy in philosophy ,",

    "@xcite the reality condition keeps track of the fact that there are many ways to express an even polynomial of majorana operators in terms of the components of a nambu spinor . the complication brought about by this redundency",
    "is compensated by the fact that it is straightforward to implement abelian bosonization in the nambu representation .",

    "in addition to the phs , we also demand , when describing the superconducting symmetry classes , that the parity of the total fermion number is conserved .",
    "this discrete global symmetry , the symmetry of the hamiltonian under the reversal of sign of all fermion operators , becomes a continuous @xmath106 global symmetry that is responsible for the conservation of the electric charge in all non - superconducting symmetry classes . in this way , all 9 symmetry classes from the tenfold way descend from the symmetry class d by imposing a composition of trs , @xmath106 charge conservation , and the chiral ( sublattice ) symmetry .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath64 in the decomposition  ( [ eq : hat h bosonized ] ) has @xmath48 gapless modes .",
    "however , @xmath64 does not commute with @xmath54 and the competition between @xmath64 and @xmath54 can gap some , if not all , the gapless modes of @xmath64 .",
    "for example , a tunneling amplitude that scatters the right mover into the left mover of each flavor in each wire will gap out the spectrum of @xmath64 .",
