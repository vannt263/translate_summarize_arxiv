    "the critical behavior of time - independent systems , especially in terms of the spectral statistics and the eigenstate statistics , has attracted great attention . on the spectrum side ,",
    "hofstadter s butterfly spectrum of the harper model has been a paradigm for critical spectral statistics , representing a multifractal spectrum @xcite of a system exactly on the metal - insulator transition point . on the eigenstate side , mainly through studies in time - independent models , such as the power - law random banded matrix ( prbm ) model @xcite and the standard anderson tight - binding model ( tbm ) @xcite , it has been well - established that for a system on a metal - insulator transition point or the anderson transition point @xcite , its eigenstates show clear fractal features .",
    "this background of understanding the critical behavior of time - independent systems motivated our interest in the critical behavior of periodically driven systems .",
    "below we first introduce recent related studies of critical floquet spectra , and then briefly describe the motivation and the results of this work .",
    "it is well known that the floquet ( quasi - energy ) spectrum of a delta - kicked version of the harper model also displays hofstadter s butterfly patterns @xcite .",
    "interestingly , though the kicked harper model ( khm ) can be classically chaotic , its spectrum , due to its fractal nature , does not follow the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture @xcite at all .",
    "this makes the khm not only a fruitful model for gaining new insights into the issue of quantum - classical correspondence in classically chaotic systems , but also an intriguing model to study critical spectral statistics .",
    "indeed , for quite a long time , studies of fractal floquet spectra were largely restricted to the khm and its variants @xcite . in a proposal to experimentally realize hofstadter s butterfly floquet spectrum in cold - atom laboratories , wang and gong @xcite recently demonstrated that hofstadter s butterfly floquet spectrum can be synthesized by use of a double - kicked cold - atom rotor system @xcite under a quantum resonance condition .",
    "@xcite then showed that the butterfly floquet spectrum of the cold - atom system studied in refs .",
    "@xcite is equivalent to that of the standard khm if and only if one system parameter takes irrational values .",
    "in addition to motivating a cold - atom realization of critical floquet spectra of periodically driven systems , refs . @xcite seem to have offered a general strategy for synthesizing critical floquet spectra in driven systems .    using an approach extended from refs .",
    "@xcite , recently wang and gong @xcite showed that the floquet spectra of a class of driven su(2 ) systems also display butterfly patterns and multifractal properties that are characteristics of highly critical spectra .",
    "this establishes a completely different class of critical driven systems without a connection with the khm context .",
    "interestingly , the driven su(2 ) model in ref .",
    "@xcite can be understood as a simple extension of the well - known kicked top model ( ktm ) @xcite in the quantum chaos literature .",
    "because the ktm has just been experimentally realized in a cold @xmath0cs system @xcite , it can be expected that a critical driven su(2 ) system may also be experimentally realized using the collective spin of a @xmath0cs atomic ensemble .",
    "an alternative experimental realization may be based on a driven two - mode bose - einstein condensate @xcite , which represents a strongly self - interacting driven system .",
    "given the above - mentioned class of driven quantum systems with critical floquet spectra , it becomes necessary to study the behavior of the associated floquet eigenstates . theoretically speaking ,",
    "because driven su(2 ) systems always have a finite number of floquet eigenstates , the eigenstate analysis becomes much easier than in the khm , with the latter necessarily involving an infinite number of eigenstates for a fractal floquet spectrum .",
    "a careful investigation of the floquet eigenstates over the entire spectrum will help to better understand the critical behavior in time - dependent systems in general .",
    "experimentally speaking , information about the eigenstate statistics may be more directly accessible to measurements than a fractal spectrum .    to analyze the critical behavior of the floquet eigenstates in driven su(2 ) systems",
    ", we adopt the same approach as in previous studies of time - independent systems .",
    "that is , we shall numerically examine the fluctuations of the eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the eigenstate fluctuations can be characterized by a set of inverse participation ratios ( ipr ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the index of the eigenstates , @xmath3 represents one eigenstate under investigation , and @xmath4 are the basis states . for convenience",
    "we focus on the ipr @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) . by analogy to critical eigenstate behavior in time - independent systems , we expect that @xmath5 scales anomalously with the hilbert space dimension @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a fractal dimension of a particular eigenstate @xmath10 . but",
    "is there also a unique fractal dimension @xmath11 for the average behavior of all the floquet eigenstates , for example , via the slope of the averaged @xmath12 , denoted @xmath13 , versus @xmath14 ? to that end , we shall examine if , as the system gets closer to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath15 ) , the distribution of @xmath16 shows signs of a scale - invariant form @xcite . in other words , whether the distribution function of @xmath12 , denoted @xmath17 $ ] , only shifts as @xmath7 varies .",
    "certainly , the system under our study has only a finite size @xmath7 . in time - independent anderson - transition studies using the prbm or the tbm ,",
    "it was conjectured that the variance of @xmath12 , denoted @xmath18 , scales with @xmath7 as @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 being three adjustable parameters @xcite . for a @xmath23-dimensional system on the anderson transition point",
    ", it was shown that @xmath22 is related to @xmath11 by @xmath24 where @xmath25 equals @xmath26 or @xmath27 depending upon whether or not the system has time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "as one main task of this work , we shall examine if these results for time - independent systems still hold for critical floquet eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , we hope to see how the criticality of the eigenstates of unitary operators differs from the criticality of the eigenstates of self - adjoint operators .",
    "results along this direction will also be relevant to recent investigations on the  unitary anderson model \" @xcite , the thue - morse sequence generating multifractal eigenstates of the quantum baker s map @xcite , the one - parameter model of quantum maps showing multifractal eigenstates @xcite , as well as recent experimental and theoretical studies of anderson transition in kicked - rotor systems @xcite .",
    "we now briefly summarize the main findings of this work .",
    "for the driven su(2 ) systems studied here , we consider two different parameter regimes : in one regime the floquet spectra display clear butterfly patterns , and in the other regime , the butterfly patterns of the floquet spectra have dissolved due to increased strength of the driving fields . for both regimes , we find that @xmath28 $ ] is not as smooth as observed in the tbm or prbm , indicating some non - universal features in dynamical systems .",
    "the @xmath28 $ ] for cases with dissolved butterfly patterns is however smoother .",
    "for either regime , it is found that the ensemble average @xmath29 does scale linearly with @xmath14 , with the slope of the @xmath30 vs @xmath14 curve clearly defining the fractal dimension @xmath11 for all the eigenstates .",
    "we also find it possible to fit the variance of @xmath31 by eq . , but with the exponent @xmath22 given by @xmath32 instead ( with @xmath33 ) ; i.e. , a factor of _ two _ is missing from the denominator as compared with eq .",
    "( 4 ) for time - independent critical systems . to further understand this difference",
    ", we propose a random matrix model , which we call  power - law random banded unitary matrix \" ( prbum ) model . by tuning the parameters of the prbum",
    ", the @xmath11 value associated with the prbum can be varied .",
    "more interestingly , we observe that the variance @xmath18 of the prbum also follows eq .",
    "( [ var_goe ] ) , with the exponent @xmath22 again given by eq .",
    "( [ dq_coe ] ) .",
    "this suggests that our findings about the floquet eigenstate statistics based on driven su(2 ) systems do reflect some general aspects of critical floquet eigenstates .",

    "section [ sec6 ] concludes this work .",
    "the focus in ref . @xcite is on the fractal spectral statistics . here , using the same model we study the statistics of the floquet eigenstates .",
    "the first floquet operator under study is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 are angular momentum operators satisfying the su(2 ) algebra and @xmath36 is the conserved total angular momentum quantum number that defines a @xmath37-dimensional hilbert space .",

    "related to this observation we also note that in our calculations , all the floquet eigenstates are treated equally and all of them are used for averaging .",
    "this is in contrast to the common procedure in analyzing time - independent critical systems , where only those energy eigenstates in a certain small energy window around zero eigenvalue are included to examine the distribution of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the justification for including all floquet states in our analysis is as follows : the quasi - energy spectra lie on a unit circle and hence all states with different eigenphases on the unit circle should be treated on equal footing . to double",
