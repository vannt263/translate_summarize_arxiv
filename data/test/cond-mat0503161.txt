    "two - band superconductivity was first proposed in the late 1950 s and further studied in the 1960 s and 1970 s as a possible explanation for understanding superconductivity in s- and d- band metals .",
    "however , it was not until the discovery of superconductivity at relatively high temperature in mgb@xmath5 in 2001 , that the most promising example of two - band superconductivity was found .",
    "after nearly four years of effort and the development of an extensive literature based on this material , it is now evident that this compound is an electron - phonon mediated superconductor , but with two distinct bands and hence two energy gaps .",
    "indeed , this is firmly established from detailed bandstructure calculations that provide the electron - phonon spectral densities which , when in turn are used in a two - band eliashberg formalism , give rise to predictions which are in accord with experiment . in fact",
    ", the picture that emerges is one of excellent agreement with the data , with the match being as good as is found between theory and experiment in conventional one - band superconductors@xcite .",
    "a detailed review and summary of the level of agreement found for the thermodynamic properties , bcs ratios , penetration depth and temperature - dependent energy gaps is found in ref .",
    "with such an extensive comparison between rigorous eliashberg theory and experiment completed , it is now appropriate to move on to the transport properties where less theoretical work has been done .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the critical current which is of fundamental interest in the discussion of transport . while most technological applications focus on the bulk critical current density , which requires understanding of flux lattice pinning , etc .",
    ", here we are presenting the critical current in thin films .",
    "this geometry is more relevant to understanding issues associated with the fundamental superconducting state , rather than focussing on material details that lead to vortex pinning , etc . , and hence can be expected to provide further insight into the nature of multiband superconductivity in these materials .",
    "we note in passing , at this point , that some authors use the term depairing current for the critical current although , technically , the depairing current is the current at which the first cooper pair is broken and the gap decreases , and the critical current is the maximum current possible , which is greater than the depairing current . in simple one - band s - wave bcs theory the values are almost the same and hence there is the tendency to use the terms interchangeably . here , these two quantities can be quite different and so we will use the term critical current to refer to the global maximum obtainable in the current density .",
    "the full temperature - dependence of the critical current @xmath2 was first studied in conventional one - band s - wave bcs superconductors by rogers@xcite and bardeen@xcite .",
    "further work following on this was done by parameter@xcite for the clean limit , and by maki@xcite for the dirty limit , where the latter author introduced a description of the superfluid current density using the green s function formalism .",
    "a study of the effect of of a current on the quasiparticle states density of states of a superconductor was done by fulde@xcite .",
    "the most general work was that of kupriyanov and lukichev@xcite , who calculated the full temperature dependence of the critical current in bcs theory for arbitrary impurity scattering , which returned the usual ginzburg - landau results for the critical current near @xmath6@xcite .",
    "further considerations led to an initial attempt to include strong inelastic scattering@xcite followed by a full eliashberg calculation and study of strong coupling effects for conventional electron - phonon superconductors done by ourselves@xcite .",
    "thus , the formalism and basic one - band results have been well - established in both the weak - coupling bcs limit and strong - coupling eliashberg regime , at all temperatures and for arbitrary impurity scattering .",
    "more recently there has been a renewed theoretical effort on the critical current as applied to exotic gaps , which are anisotropic , such as d - wave@xcite and f - wave@xcite .",
    "the two - band case is , in some sense , a highly anisotropic system and hence the study of the critical current in this instance also complements these recent works .    with regard to mgb@xmath5 ,",
    "specifically , there has been some recent experimental work by kunchur@xcite , where the critical current has been measured in these systems . on the theoretical side , koshelev and",
    "golubov@xcite have gone beyond ginzburg - landau to use the usadel equations to study this system and find interesting effects such as a kink in the temperature - dependence of the c - axis critical current that reflects the underlying two - band nature .",
    "this type of feature is observed in other properties such as the penetration depth which also shows an inflection point in the temperature dependence , however , these effects may disappear with increased interband coupling .",
    "finally , a more recent work has been done on the topic of the non - linear term in the superfluid current in mgb@xmath5 and its effect on the nonlinear microwave response , which is relevant for device applications@xcite .    in our work here , we use the general green s function formulation presented by maki@xcite where the cooper pairs are given a finite center of mass momentum @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath1 leads to a boost in the quasiparticle energy ( sometimes called a doppler shift ) .",
    "the superfluid velocity @xmath7 is taken as uniform in the case of discussing currents in thin films or wires , unlike the doppler shift effect in the context of superfluid currents in the vortex state , where @xmath8 varies with spatial position .",
    "this latter topic has been the subject of a large number of papers in the recent literature relating to d - wave superconductors@xcite .",
    "a very fine physical description of the effect of this doppler shift on the quasiparticle density of states and the resulting effect on the superfluid density is presented in a paper by xu et al.@xcite , where they consider the non - linear meissner effect in d - wave superconductors from a starting point that discusses the basics of the superfluid current density .",
    "thus , with a body of literature developing on the topic of critical currents and superfluid currents , it is of interest to elucidate the features in the critical current due to two - band superconductivity , where unusual effects can occur due to a transfer from one band to the other of the dominant contribution to superfluid current and hence the critical current .",
    "our paper is structured in the following manner . in section  ii",
    ", we introduce the basic theoretical equations which we have evaluated .",
    "we then examine , in section  iii , results for renormalized bcs theory near @xmath6 and at @xmath9 and apply these results to mgb@xmath5 . in section",
    "iv , we present our eliashberg results for finite temperature and with impurities , evaluating the critical current for mgb@xmath5 and other model parameters .",
    "we also compare our results to the data for mgb@xmath5 .",
    "finally , we form our conclusions in section  v.",
    "while various approaches have been used in the past for calculating the superfluid current , we will use the green s function method as presented by maki@xcite .",
    "thus the superfluid current density @xmath10 is given in terms of finite temperature green s functions as : @xmath11\\quad , \\label{eq : js1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the electron charge , @xmath13 , the electron mass , @xmath14 is the electron momentum , and @xmath15 is the temperature .",

    "this shift in zero along the horizontal axis is also accompanied by a shift to the left , relative to the decoupled case , of the inflection points just described , but these shifts are small .",

    "is that increasing @xmath169 to 0.1 as in the second frame from the top has not had a large effect on the partial current from the first band except to reduce somewhat the value of @xmath1 at which the current goes to zero .",

    "more significantly the partial current starts to deviate from linearity at @xmath183 at which point it drops rapidly towards zero but remains finite ( although small ) until the current in the first band has reached zero .",

    "when there is more integration of the two systems ( second frame from top ) both bands can make a significant contribution . in the top three frames ,",
    "the first peak is lower than the second while in the fourth frame , the opposite holds .",
    "the height of the first peak can be made higher by increasing the value of @xmath184 as in the third frame compared with the first ( or equivalently , increasing @xmath185 as the density of states enters in combination with @xmath131 and so will have a similar effect , which is redundant to discuss here ) or by increasing @xmath176 as in the fourth , again compared with the first .",
    "it can also be increased by increasing the offdiagonal coupling as in the second frame .",
    "when this is done , however , the contribution of the second band to the total current in the second peak is also increased .",
    "finally we note that the peak heights in the two middle frames are only very slightly different and the lower @xmath1 peak could be made to be the highest through a small tuning of the parameters . as the highest peak determines the value of @xmath2 , this transfer from one peak to the other by varying parameters is very interesting and will produce nonstandard effects at finite temperature .      before leaving our discussion of rbcs at @xmath9 ,",

    "at the end of the last section , we showed a comparison between rbcs and eliashberg theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . given that the electron - phonon spectral functions for mgb@xmath5 are available , it is appropriate to work with the full theory for @xmath2 as a function of temperature and impurity scattering .",
    "we begin with a consideration of temperature effects . in the upper frame of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the current @xmath208 normalized by @xmath209 as a function of @xmath164 for nine values of temperature from @xmath207 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1",

    "( [ eq : js2 ] ) .",
    "however , reference to the lower frame of fig .  [ fig3 ] shows that the second band contributes only about 10% to the total critical current at @xmath9 and this remains true at @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , this curve is very nearly the single band result and deviates from the classical bcs curve almost entirely because of retardation effects .",

    "unfortunately , information on the individual intraband scattering rates in these films for @xmath215 and @xmath216 bands , separately , is not available to us . including some impurity scattering in the @xmath215 band",

    "the other critical current curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are for different ratios of @xmath174 as indicated in the figure caption .",
    "in addition to allowing for some uncertainty in the reported @xmath131 values in the literature , this also mimics the possibility of currents associated with the c - axis where the @xmath216-band is known to have a much smaller @xmath131 than the @xmath215-band .",
    "likewise , we have not included the details of the full fermi surface average in the expression for the current , however , it is known that the @xmath216-band is quasi - two - dimensional as opposed to the more three - dimensional @xmath215-band .",
    "dahm and scalapino@xcite find significant geometrical corrections associated with such averaging which could also accentuate the difference between the two bands .",
    "this may also be approximately captured by our use of different @xmath131 ratios .",
    "all the curves are normalized to have a slope of negative one at @xmath145 .",
    "as @xmath184 is increased , the normalized critical current at zero temperature increases and can become considerably larger than its one - band bcs value .",
    "there is also a change in the temperature variation of the curves , the dashed curve shows a clear kink around @xmath217 while the long - dashed curve shows concave upward behavior at intermediate temperatures .",
    "this can be understood better when the pattern of behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is considered .",
    "( 250,200 )    the top frame gives the temperature evolution for the case @xmath218 and the bottom is for a ratio of 4 .",
    "the notation is as for the top frame of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and for the same nine reduced temperatures . in the top frame , it is the peak at lower @xmath1 which determines the critical current at @xmath213 while at higher @xmath212 , it is the peak with higher @xmath1 .",
    "this crossover occurs between @xmath219 and @xmath220 and leads to the kink seen in the dashed curve of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( lower frame ) .",
    "if we look at the individual contributions from each band ( not shown here ) to the total current , we find that at @xmath9 it is the second band which makes the dominant contribution because of its large value of @xmath131 but near @xmath6 this contribution has decayed sufficiently that it only makes a 30% contribution to the total .    in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the peak at smaller value of @xmath1 has greatly increased in magnitude over its value in the top frame .",
    "it has also moved to a lower value of @xmath1 as expected from fig .  1 .",
    "however , now there is no crossover from smaller to larger @xmath1 peak and hence no kink .",
    "nevertheless , the dotted curve is very different from a one - band bcs variation .",
    "we can understand better how this can arise by once more looking at the partial contribution to the critical current from each band .",
    "at @xmath9 it is the second band which dominates while at @xmath6 it accounts only for 2/3 of the total with the remaining 1/3 contribution from band one .",
    "this difference in admixture of the two bands with temperature is seen to be enough to cause an upward curvature in the dotted curve at intermediate temperatures as well as to increase the value of the normalized critical current at @xmath9 to a value considerably larger than the bcs value of 0.72 .",
    "increasing @xmath184 further as in the long - dashed curve of the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] increases the @xmath9 value even further as the peak at lower @xmath1 value becomes even more prominent .",
    "details of the temperature variation of the critical current clearly depend on details of the microscopic parameters of the two bands involved , such as values of @xmath221 .",
    "for example , it is possible to shift the kink in @xmath118 to higher values of reduced temperature and to make it sharper by considering other parameter sets .",
    "( 250,200 )    to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show results for a lorentzian @xmath222 spectrum defined in detail in our previous paper@xcite . in this model , @xmath159",
    "and we take @xmath223 to decrease the gap anisotropy as compared with mgb@xmath5 .",
    "we have also taken @xmath173 ( nearly decoupled bands ) .",
    "the top frame gives the current @xmath224 for the case of @xmath218 , for the nine values of reduced temperature previously chosen . with this @xmath131 ratio ,",
    "the peak with lower value of @xmath1 remains highest at small @xmath212 and the crossover of the maximum to the other peak occurs at a reduced temperature between 0.6 and 0.7 .",
    "this manifests itself as a sharp kink in the solid curve for @xmath2 ( bottom frame ) at this same temperature .",
    "also shown in this same frame are results for the critical current when @xmath225 ( dotted ) and @xmath226 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "for the larger value of @xmath184 , the normalized current at @xmath9 is increased over the @xmath218 case as expected and for @xmath227 it is reduced but remains above bcs . in this latter case , the two peaks in the current versus @xmath1 are closer together than they are in the top frame of fig .  [ fig6 ] and seem to almost merge before the crossover from lower to higher @xmath1 peak occurs , which means that the kink in the dotted curve can hardly be seen .",
    "it is clear that a rich pattern of behavior exists for the current versus @xmath1 at different reduced @xmath212 in a two - band model .",
    "this translates into quite distinct temperature dependence for @xmath118 as compared with the one - band bcs canonical behavior .",
    "some addition insight into this complicated behavior can be obtained from a consideration of simplified but analytic bcs results in the limiting case of two decoupled , well - separated bands , i.e. , for small values of the gap anisotropy @xmath228 . under this assumption ,",
    "@xmath144 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 so that the critical current near @xmath6 given by formula ( [ eq : bcs14 ] ) reduces to @xmath232 and is determined entirely by band one , as previously commented upon .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , however , two possible circumstances can arise .",
    "the critical current can remain determined by the same band ( number one ) in which case we can write approximately @xmath233 a second possibility is that a crossover to the peak at lower @xmath1 value occurs and we have approximately @xmath234 for the first case , @xmath235 which is the one - band bcs result where we have normalized the critical current in such a way that @xmath211 has a slope of negative one at @xmath145 .",
    "this conforms with what we have done in the lower frames of figs .",

    "doing so leads to the well - known and physically expected result that for small superfluid velocity @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the superfluid density of the @xmath33th band given for a strong coupling superconductor by @xmath244^{3/2}}\\biggr ] \\label{eq : bcsg}\\ ] ] in bcs at @xmath9 , this becomes @xmath245 and @xmath246 for band 1 and band 2 , respectively .",
    "the slope of @xmath247 as a function of @xmath8 gives @xmath248 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bcsg ] ) valid for any temperature and any impurity content .",
    "the impurities enter only through the eliashberg gap equations ( [ eq : del ] ) and ( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "as the temperature is increased , the superfluid density is reduced and so the slope of @xmath224 seen in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] to [ fig6 ] is correspondingly reduced .",
    "impurities also reduce the superfluid density . in bcs , the known result for each of the two bands separately , to lowest order , is @xmath249 with @xmath250 and @xmath251 , the coherence length and impurity mean free path in the @xmath33th band , respectively .",
    "this applies to intraband scattering which reduces the initial slope of the partial current coming from each band .",
    "( 250,200 )    results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where we also consider the interband case @xmath252 . in the top frame ,",

    "intraband impurities reduce only the partial contribution to the current coming from that band .",
    "it reduces its value on the vertical axis and extends the x - axis to higher values of @xmath1 leaving the second band largely unaffected . of course",
    ", since both bands contribute significantly to the total current in the region of the peak corresponding to the smaller value of @xmath1 , its magnitude is reduced even in the dotted curve . on the other hand , for the dashed curve",
    ", there is little change in the region of the second peak which is dominated by the first band .",
    "by contrast interband impurities modify both bands in a similar fashion .",
    "the corresponding critical current as a function of @xmath260 is shown in the lower frame .",
    "the solid line is the pure case of fig .",
    "as expected , a finite value of @xmath258 has reduced the critical current below its value in the pure case at all temperatures , however , when normalized to a slope of magnitude one near @xmath6 , the effect pushes the curve up at low @xmath15 .",
    "a kink remains and the crossover temperature is only slightly shifted toward higher values . for the dashed curve ,",
    "the significant modifications arise only below the kink temperature .",
    "by contrast the main effect of the interband impurities is to wash out the kink structure leaving the rest of the curve largely unaffected ( of course the @xmath6 would show a small shift downwards relative to @xmath257 , not shown here ) .",
    "in conventional one - band s - wave superconductors , the energy gap @xmath57 remains unaffected by the flow of a supercurrent up to a critical value of the superfluid velocity @xmath7 ( ie .",

    "the current @xmath0 is linear in @xmath8 with proportionality constant equal to the superfluid density . beyond this critical value of @xmath8 , the rapid reduction in the gap in addition to a quasiparticle backflow",

    "a first one near the critical value of the superfluid velocity for band two and the other near the larger critical value of @xmath8 corresponding to the first band alone .",
    "the first peak has in general a significant contribution from both bands ( unless @xmath264 ) while the second peak could be due mainly to the first band .",
    "the relative admixture depends on microscopic parameters such as density of states @xmath265 and fermi velocities @xmath32 , as well as gap anisotropy .",
    "when @xmath184 is made large as compared to @xmath241 , the first peak moves to lower values of @xmath8 and can also become larger than the second at low temperature .",
    "as the temperature is increased the superfluid density in each band is reduced but that in the second band is more strongly affected because of its smaller gap value . consequently , since the critical current is determined by the height of the highest peak , one can have a crossover from the first to second peak as @xmath15 is raised from @xmath266 to @xmath6 and this will reflect itself as a kink in the temperature dependence of the critical current . such a feature is also found in the dirty limit calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the critical current along the c - axis .",
    "when there is a significant interband coupling or the two gaps are close in value ( isotropic case ) the two peaks in the total current cease to be independent and a rich pattern of behavior emerges for the temperature and impurity dependence of the two peaks .",
    "in particular , as the temperature is raised , the first peak can remain the determining peak for @xmath2 up to @xmath6 or it can become the smaller of the two at a crossover temperature which can be increased or decreased through judicious choices of parameters .",
    "another possibility is that the two peaks merge into one or that the second peak is the dominant one at all temperatures .",
    "application to the specific case mgb@xmath5 , which involves no adjustable parameters , gives good agreement with the in - plane data of kunchur@xcite .",
    "if the resulting critical current @xmath211 is normalized to have slope of negative one as a function of @xmath58 near @xmath145 , the corresponding value of the critical current at @xmath9 will differ from its classic one - band bcs value of 0.72 .",
    "strong coupling effects resulting from our use of the full eliashberg equations , with appropriate electron - phonon spectral densities describing the electron - phonon interaction , are known@xcite to always reduce the normalized value of @xmath267 while two - band effects can reduce or increase it depending on the detailed values of the microscopic parameters involved .",
    "in particular , a large value of @xmath184 relative to @xmath241 can lead to values that can be even larger than one .",
    "this is expected for the case of current orientated along the c - axis for the specific parameters representative of mgb@xmath5 . in this case , because the @xmath216 band ( band one in our notation ) is nearly two - dimensional , the fermi velocity of the @xmath215 band in the c - direction will be much greater than that for the @xmath216 band .",
    "the superfluid density in each subband , which determines the initial slope of the linear in @xmath8 regime for the supercurrent , is reduced with the increase in intraband impurity scattering .",
    "this fact can be used to manipulate the position along the @xmath8 axis and size of the two peaks in the total current and consequently the temperature dependence of the resulting critical current .",
    "introducing impurities in the first band will reduce the critical current at all temperatures since this band always makes a contribution to the total current . on the other hand ,",
    "if they are introduced only in the second band , this will leave the critical current largely unaltered around @xmath113 .",
    "interband impurity scattering affects both bands although not necessarily in exactly the same way and leads to the smoothing out of the kink in @xmath268 versus @xmath212 when it exists .    in conclusion",
