    "spatial point patterns have important implications in epidemiology , population biology , ecology , and other fields , and have been extensively studied .",
    "most of the research on spatial patterns from the early days on pertains to patterns of one type of points ; i.e. , to spatial pattern of a type of points with respect to the ground ( e.g. , density , clumpiness , etc . ) .",
    "these patterns for only one type of points usually fall under the pattern category called _ spatial aggregation _ ( @xcite ) , _ clustering _ , or _",
    "regularity_. however , it is also of practical interest to investigate the spatial interaction of one type of points with other types ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial relationships among two or more types of points have interesting consequences , especially for plant species .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for convenience and generality ,",
    "we refer to the different types of points as  classes \" , but _ class _ can stand for any characteristic of an individual at a particular location .",
    "for example , the spatial segregation pattern has been investigated for _ species _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , _ age classes _ of plant species ( @xcite ) , _ fish species _ ( @xcite ) , and _ sexes _ of dioecious plants ( @xcite ) .",
    "many of the epidemiologic applications are for a two - class system of case and control labels ( @xcite ) .",
    "many univariate and multivariate ( i.e. , one - class and multi - class ) tests have been proposed for testing segregation of two classes in statistical and other literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "these include comparison of ripley s @xmath0 functions ( @xcite ) , comparison of nn distances ( @xcite ) , and nncts ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed various tests based on nncts for the two - class case only and @xcite introduced an overall test of segregation and class - specific tests based on nncts for the two - class case and extended his tests to multi - class case ( @xcite ) . for the two - class case ,",
    "@xcite discussed these tests and demonstrated that pielou s test is liberal under csr independence or rl and is only appropriate for a random sample of ( base , nn ) pairs .",
    "if @xmath1 is a nn of point @xmath2 , then @xmath2 is called the _ base point _ and @xmath1",
    "is called the _",
    "nn point_. he also suggested the use of fisher s exact test for nncts and evaluated its variants and the exact version of pearson s test in ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite proposed new cell - specific and overall segregation tests which are more robust to the differences in the relative abundance of classes and have better performance in terms of size and power .    in literature , most segregation tests are two - sided tests for the two - class case or against a general alternative for the multi - class case .",
    "in particular , the nnct - tests in literature are not directional tests . in this article",
    ", we discuss the directional ( i.e. , one - sided ) versions of the cell - specific tests of @xcite and @xcite and propose new directional segregation tests .",
    "we compare these tests in terms of distributional properties , and empirical size and power through extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also compare these tests with ripley s @xmath3 or @xmath4-functions ( @xcite ) and pair correlation function @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , which are methods for second - order analysis of point patterns .",
    "we only consider _ completely mapped data _ ;",
    "i.e. , for our data sets , the locations of all events in a defined area are observed .",
    "we show through simulation that the newly proposed directional tests perform similar ( only slightly better in power ) to the cell - specific tests of @xcite but perform better ( in terms of empirical size and power ) than dixon s cell - specific tests .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that our tests and ripley s @xmath4-function and related methods ( i.e. , second - order analysis ) answer different questions about the pattern of interest .",
    " dependence \" in this article refers to the dependence in the probabilistic sense between the cell counts which results from the spatial dependence between the points from spatial point patterns .",
    "spatial dependence between points in a particular pattern is a well known phenomenon and has been extensively studied . in mathematical statistics ,  spatial dependence \" is used as a measure of the degree of spatial interaction between independently measured observations from a temporally or spatially ordered set of points .",
    "the cause of spatial dependence is not the sample selection , nor sample preparation , nor the measurement order ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in practice , the spatial data show dependence due to the order they occupy in space and time . modeling",
    "such dependence usually causes problems in the statistical analysis because time is unidirectional , and space is omnidirectional ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "nearest neighbor spatial dependence is a consequence of this spatial dependence ( @xcite ) .",
    "just as the spatial patterns have been mostly analyzed for one - class patterns , spatial dependence is usually investigated for one class only .",
    "for example , indices of dependence ( for clustering or regularity ) are proposed by @xcite and are extended for multi - type point patterns in ( @xcite ) . in the latter article , the authors introduce a dependence index whose values , if larger than 1 , indicate inhibition ( similar to what we call segregation in this article ) , and if smaller than 1 , indicate positive association ( similar to what we call association in this article ) and equals to 1 for poisson point patterns . hence , segregation and association can be viewed as two opposite types of spatial dependence between two or more classes .    for simplicity , we discuss the spatial clustering patterns between two classes only ; the extension to the case with more classes is straightforward for the cell - specific tests .",
    "we discuss the null and alternative patterns in section [ sec : null - and - alt ] , describe the construction of the nncts in section [ sec : nnct ] , discuss dixon s and ceyhan s cell - specific segregation tests in sections [ sec : dixon - cell - spec ] and [ sec : cell - spec - csda ] , and introduce directional version of pielou s test of segregation in section [ sec : directional - k=2 ] , and new directional tests in section [ sec : new - directional ] .",
    "we provide the empirical significance level analysis under csr independence in section [ sec : empirical - size ] , empirical power analysis under segregation and association alternatives in section [ sec : emp - power ] , and illustrate the tests in example data sets in section [ sec : examples ] , provide discussion and guidelines for using the tests in section [ sec : disc - conc ] .",
    "the null hypothesis in the univariate spatial point pattern analysis is usually _ complete spatial randomness _ ( _ csr _ ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two benchmark hypotheses to investigate the spatial interaction between multiple classes in a multivariate process : ( i ) _ independence _ , which implies the classes of points are generated by independent univariate processes and ( ii ) _ random labeling _",
    "( rl ) , which implies that the class labels are randomly assigned to a given set of locations in the region of interest ( @xcite ) . in this article ,",
    "our null hypothesis is @xmath6 which might result from two random pattern types : csr of points from two classes ( this pattern will be called the _ csr independence _ , henceforth ) or rl .",
    "in the csr independence pattern , points from each of the two classes independently satisfy the csr pattern in the region of interest .",
    "although csr independence and rl are not same , they lead to the same null model for nnct - tests , since a nnct does not require spatially - explicit information .",
    "that is , when the points from two classes are assumed to be independently uniformly distributed over the region of interest , i.e. , under the csr independence pattern , or when only the labeling ( or marking ) of a set of fixed points ( where the allocation of the points might be regular , aggregated , or clustered , or of lattice type ) is considered , i.e. , under the rl pattern , there is randomness in the nn structure .",
    "we discuss the differences in practice and theory for either case .",
    "the distinction between csr independence and rl is very important when defining the appropriate null model in practice ; i.e. , the null model depends on the particular ecological context .",
    "@xcite state that csr independence implies that the two classes are _ a priori _ the result of different processes ( e.g. , individuals of different species or age cohorts ) , whereas rl implies that some processes affect _ a posteriori _ the individuals of a single population ( e.g. , diseased vs. non - diseased individuals of a single species ) .",
    "we provide the differences in the proposed tests under these two patterns . for a more detailed discussion of csr independence and rl patterns , see ( @xcite ) .    as clustering alternatives , we consider two major types of spatial patterns : _ segregation _ and _ association_. _ segregation _ occurs if the nn of an individual is more likely to be of the same class as the individual than to be from a different class ; i.e. , the members of the same class tend to be clumped or clustered ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , one type of plant might not grow well around another type of plant and vice versa . in plant biology",
    ", one class of points might represent the coordinates of trees from a species with large canopy , so that other plants ( whose coordinates are the other class of points ) that need light can not grow ( well or at all ) around these trees . in epidemiology , one class of points might be the geographical coordinates of residences of cases and the other class of points might be the coordinates of the residences of controls .",
    "furthermore , social and ethnic segregation of residential areas can be viewed as a special type of segregation . given the locations of the residences , the ethnic identity or social status of the residents",
    "can be viewed as class labels assigned randomly or not .",
    "for example , the residents of similar social status or same ethnic identity might tend to gather in certain neighborhoods which is an example of segregation as opposed to rl of the residences .",
    "_ association _ occurs if the nn of an individual is more likely to be from another class than to be of the same class as the individual .",
    "for example , in plant biology , the two classes of points might represent the coordinates of mutualistic plant species , so the species depend on each other to survive .",
    "as another example , the points from one class might be the geometric coordinates of parasitic plants exploiting the other plant whose coordinates are the points of the other class .",
    "the patterns of segregation and association do not only result from multivariate interaction between the classes .",
    "it is also conceivable to have either of these patterns without any interaction between the point processes ; for example , consider the case where species happen to have the same or different fine - scale habitat preferences .",
    "each of the two patterns of segregation and association are not symmetric in the sense that , when two classes are segregated ( or associated ) , they do not necessarily exhibit the same degree of segregation ( or association ) .",
    "for example , when points from each of two classes labeled as @xmath7 and @xmath8 are clustered at different locations , but class @xmath7 is loosely clustered ( i.e. , its point intensity in the clusters is smaller ) compared to class @xmath8 so that classes @xmath7 and @xmath8 are segregated but class @xmath8 is more segregated than class @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , when class @xmath8 points are clustered around class @xmath7 points but not vice versa , classes @xmath8 and @xmath7 are associated , but class @xmath8 is more associated with class @xmath7 compared to the other way around .",
    "although it is not possible to list all of the many different types of segregation ( and association ) , its existence can be tested by an analysis of the nn relationships between the classes ( @xcite ) .",
    "nncts are constructed using the nn frequencies of classes .",
    "the construction of nncts for two classes is described here ; extension to multi - class case is straightforward . consider two classes with labels @xmath9 which stand for classes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath10 be the number of points from class @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the total sample size .",
    "if the class of each point and the class of its nn were recorded , the nn relationships fall into four distinct categories : @xmath14 where in cell @xmath15 , class @xmath11 is the _ base class _ , while class @xmath16 is the class of its _",
    "nn_. that is , the @xmath13 points constitute @xmath13 ( base , nn ) pairs .",
    "then each pair can be categorized with respect to the base label ( row categories ) and nn label ( column categories ) . denoting @xmath17 as the frequency of cell @xmath15 ( i.e. , the count of all ( base , nn ) pairs",
    "each of which has label @xmath15 ) for @xmath18 yields the nnct in table [ tab : nnct-2x2 ] where the column sum @xmath19 is the number of times class @xmath16 points serve as nns for @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 is the cell count for cell @xmath15 that is the sum of all ( base , nn ) pairs each of which has label @xmath15 .",
    "notice that @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; and @xmath23 . by construction ,",
    "if @xmath17 is larger ( smaller ) than expected , then class @xmath16 serves as nn more ( less ) to class @xmath11 than expected , which implies ( lack of ) segregation if @xmath24 and ( lack of ) association of class @xmath16 with class @xmath11 if @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we adopt the convention that variables denoted by upper ( lower ) case letters are random ( fixed ) quantities .    .",

    "this is along the lines of the nnct analysis results , which indicate no significant deviation from csr independence at smaller scales .",

    "$ ] , the pair correlation function suggests that @xmath7 and @xmath8 points are significantly segregated at about .14 and .20 only . at other distances",
    ", the points do not significantly deviate from csr independence .",
    "so at smaller scales ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) the univariate and bivariate @xmath4-functions seem to be in agreement with the nnct results which indicate no deviation from csr independence .",
    "pielou s and dixon s segregation tests based on nearest neighbor contingency tables ( nncts ) are @xmath47-tests , hence are used for two - sided alternatives . that is ,",
    "when the null patterns of csr independence or rl are rejected , these tests do not indicate the direction of the alternative pattern , which consist of segregation or association patterns . in this article , we discuss directional ( i.e. , one - sided ) tests of segregation based on nncts .",
    "we propose a directional version of pielou s test by partitioning the @xmath47 test statistic in the usual fashion ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the problem that confounds pielou s test ( i.e. , the problem of dependence between cell counts ) is inherited by the directional versions also .",
    "this makes the directional version of pielou s test liberal in rejecting the null case of csr independence or rl .",
    "we also consider the directional versions of the cell - specific tests due to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we introduce two new directional tests of segregation .    we discuss the differences in these nnct - tests , compare the tests using extensive monte carlo simulations under rl and csr independence and under various segregation and association alternatives .",
    "we also illustrate the tests on four examples and compare them with ripley s @xmath4-function ( @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrate that under the csr independence pattern , nnct - tests are conditional on @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but not under rl .    based on our monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we conclude that the asymptotic approximation for the cell - specific and the directional tests is appropriate only when the corresponding cell count in the nnct is larger than 10 .",
    "when a cell count is less than 10 , we recommend the monte carlo randomization of these tests .",
    "type i error rates ( empirical significance levels ) of ceyhan s cell - specific and of the new directional tests are more robust to the differences in sample sizes ( i.e. , differences in relative abundances ) . considering the empirical significance levels and power estimates of the tests ,",
    "we recommend version ii of the new tests ( defined in equation ) for the two - sided alternatives provided the sample sizes are not very different .",
    "the csr independence pattern assumes that the study region is unbounded for the analyzed pattern , which is not the case in practice .",
    "edge effects are a constant problem in the analysis of empirical ( i.e. , bounded ) data sets and much effort has gone into the development of edge correction methods ( @xcite ) . so the edge ( or boundary ) effects might confound the test results if the null pattern is the csr independence .",
    "two correction methods for the edge effects on nnct - tests , namely buffer zone correction and toroidal correction , are investigated in ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) where it is recommended that inner or outer buffer zone correction for nnct - tests could be used with the width of the buffer area being about the average nn distance . but",
    "larger buffer areas are not recommended since they are wasteful with little additional gain .",
    "on the other hand , toroidal edge correction is recommended with points within the average nn distance in the additional copies around the study region . for larger distances",
    ", the gain might not be worth the effort .",
    "we extend these recommendations for the new directional tests also .",
    "nnct - tests summarize the pattern in the data set for small scales , more specifically , they provide information on the pattern around the average nn distance between all points . on the other hand , pair correlation function @xmath5 and ripley s classical @xmath3 or @xmath4-functions and other variants provide information on the pattern at various scales .",
    "however , the classical @xmath4-function is not appropriate for the null pattern of rl when locations of the points have spatial inhomogeneity . for such cases ,",
    "diggle s @xmath50-function ( @xcite p. 131 ) is more appropriate in testing the bivariate spatial clustering at various scales .",
    "our example illustrates that for distances around the average nn distance , nnct - tests and ripley s bivariate @xmath4-function yield similar results .    if significant , the cell - specific test and the new tests ( for the two - sided alternative ) imply significant deviation from the null pattern .",
    "furthermore , the sign of the test statistic will be suggestive of segregation ( if positive ) and association ( if negative ) .",
    "but these tests are more powerful against the one - sided alternatives . for a data set",
    "for which csr independence is the reasonable null pattern , we recommend the nnct - tests if the question of interest is the spatial interaction at small scales ( i.e. , about the mean nn distance ) .",
    "one can also perform ripley s @xmath3 or @xmath4-function and only consider distances up to around the average nn distance and compare the results with those of nnct analysis . if the spatial interaction at higher scales is of interest , pair correlation function is recommended ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , if the rl pattern is the reasonable null pattern for the data , we recommend the nnct - tests if the small - scale interaction is of interest and diggle s @xmath50-function if the spatial interaction at higher scales is also of interest .",
