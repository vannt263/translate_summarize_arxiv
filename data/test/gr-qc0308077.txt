    "the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of spacetimes containing black holes have been studied since the pioneering work of vishveshwara @xcite , who first observed quasinormal ringing of a schwarzschild spacetime in his numerical calculations . the main motivation to study the qnm of a black hole is twofold :",
    "one is to answer the question of whether the spacetime is stable or not , and the other to know what kind of oscillations will be excited in the spacetime when some perturbations are given . in an astrophysical point of view , the latter is quite important from the observational point of view because we could determine fundamental parameters of a black hole , such as the mass or the angular momentum , through the information of the qnms .",
    "thus , a large number of studies on the qnms of spacetimes containing black holes have been done ( for review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is another interesting aspect of the qnms in a black hole which is related to the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "bekenstein and mukhanov discussed the relationship between the fundamental area unit in the quantum theory of gravity and a bohr transition frequency , applying bohr s correspondence principle with a hydrogen atom to the quantum theory of a black hole @xcite . for a schwarzschild black hole",
    ", they then derived the bohr transition frequency @xmath5 , given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 stands for the mass of a black hole .",
    "furthermore they predicted the value of @xmath9 to be @xmath10 , and suggested that this frequency should be equal to classical oscillation frequencies of the black hole .",
    "a few years ago , hod however noticed that if @xmath11 , the frequency given by formula ( [ bekenstein ] ) is in quite good agreement with the asymptotic frequency of the qnm of a schwarzschild black hole in the limit of highly damped modes , and proposed to apply bohr s correspondence principle in order to determine the value of the fundamental area unit in the quantum theory of gravity , namely the value of @xmath9 @xcite ( see , also @xcite ) . since hod s proposal , the qnms with large imaginary frequencies of spacetimes including black holes",
    "have been attracted much attention , and a lot of papers related to this subject have appeared in order to see whether hod s conjecture is applicable not only for a schwarzschild black hole but also for other black hole spacetimes .",
    "for example , motl analytically obtained an asymptotic constant value of the qnm frequencies of a schwarzschild black hole @xcite , which had been obtained numerically by nollert @xcite .",
    "motl and neitzke @xcite , berti and kokkotas @xcite , neitzke @xcite , and andersson and howls @xcite studied the asymptotic behaviors of the qnms in a reissner - nordstr \" om black hole .",
    "berti et al .",
    "@xcite , and hod @xcite discussed the qnms of a kerr black hole in the limit of highly damped modes .",
    "as for a schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) black hole , cardoso and lemos @xcite and maassen van den brink @xcite analytically obtained asymptotic form of the qnm frequencies in almost the extremal limit , in which the cosmological horizon becomes very close to the black hole horizon ( for the case of a schwarzschild black hole in an anti - de sitter spacetime , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a large number of papers related to hod s conjecture , which have recently appeared , suggest that hod s conjecture is not universal , at least as it stands , even though it is applicable for schwarzschild black holes in four and higher dimensions ( for the higher dimensional case , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a real part of the quasinormal frequencies in a reissner - nordstr \" om black hole appears not to go to any constant value in the limit of highly damped mode , but shows some periodic behaviors as the imaginary part is increased @xcite .",
    "this means that hod s conjecture is not applicable in the reissner - nordstr \" om case because a real part of the quasinormal frequencies does not have a limit as the imaginary part goes to infinity .",
    "in such a situation , it is necessary to explore a problem whether or not there is another black hole spacetime in which hod s conjecture is applicable .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve our understanding of this problem and we are concerned here with the qnms of sds spacetimes .",
    "sds spacetime has no spatial infinity but has cosmological horizon , and if hod s conjecture is applicable , it is interesting to see whether hod s conjecture depends only on the black hole horizon , but not the cosmological horizon . furthermore , recent observations show that the universe does have a non - zero positive cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , sds spacetimes are considered to be a good simple model of a black hole in the universe .    in this study , in particular , we calculate numerically the qnms of nearly extremal sds spacetimes for reason we describe below .",
    "we therefore assume the surface gravity @xmath2 at the black hole horizon to be @xmath12 , where @xmath1 stands for the coordinate radius of the black hole horizon .",
    "note that the extremal limit of the sds space corresponds to the limit of @xmath13 .",
    "in a nearly extremal sds black hole , as mentioned before , an analytical formula for quasinormal frequencies can be derived @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to examine whether this analytical formula is correct in the limit of highly damped modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the basic equations for obtaining qnms in the sds spacetime using leaver s continued fraction technique @xcite , which was extended to the case of the sds spacetime by moss and norman @xcite .",
    "numerical results are given in  3 , and  4 is devoted for conclusion .",
    "in order to examine the qnms of the sds spacetime , we make use of the same formalism as that derived by moss and norman @xcite , who obtained low - order quasinormal frequencies of the sds spacetime for a wide range of the model parameter . the line element of the sds spacetime is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 here",
    ", @xmath8 and @xmath16 stand for the mass of the black hole and the cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "if a non - negative cosmological constant is assumed , namely de sitter spacetime , there are two horizons , whose radial coordinates are given as positive solutions of @xmath17 , one is the black hole horizon @xmath18 and the other the cosmological horizon @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "note that the equation @xmath21 has one negative solution @xmath22 for the sds space .",
    "one of the important model parameters of the sds spacetime is the surface gravity @xmath2 , defined by @xmath23 in terms of the non - dimensional surface gravity @xmath0 , the mass and the cosmological constant can be written as @xmath24 which shows that @xmath25 for the sds spacetime . in this study , we employ the non - dimensional parameter @xmath0 to specify the sds spacetime .    by virtue of the symmetry properties of the sds spacetime , the master equations for the scalar ( @xmath26 ) , electromagnetic ( @xmath27 ) and gravitational perturbations ( @xmath28 )",
    "can be cast into a wave equation of the simple form , given by @xcite @xmath29\\phi(r)=0\\ , , \\label{wave - equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes the tortoise coordinate , defined by @xmath31 , and @xmath5 is the oscillation frequency of the perturbations .",
    "depending on the type of perturbations , here , the effective potential is explicitly given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 means the angular quantum number of perturbations . here , only the axial parity perturbations have been considered for the gravitational case because quasinormal frequencies of the polar parity perturbations are the same as those of the axial parity perturbations ( for the proof , see appendix ) .",
    "the qnms of the sds spacetime are characterized by the boundary conditions of incoming waves at the black hole horizon and outgoing waves at the cosmological horizon , given by @xmath34 where the time dependence of perturbations has been assumed to be @xmath35 . in general",
    ", it is impossible to adapt the boundary condition ( [ def - bc ] ) in a straightforward numerical integration to obtain quasinormal frequencies .",
    "some special technique is therefore required for computations of qnms . in the present investigation",
    ", we employ a standard technique devised by leaver , namely the continued fraction method @xcite .",
    "to apply the continued fraction method to the sds spacetime , it is convenient to introduce a new independent variable , defined by @xmath36 . with this new variable @xmath37 , the asymptotic form of the perturbations as @xmath38 can be rewritten as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 the perturbation function @xmath44 is expanded around the black hole horizon as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 s for @xmath48 are determined by the three term recurrence relation , given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 here , @xmath28 for the gravitational perturbations and @xmath27 for the electromagnetic perturbations .",
    "note that in the present study , we do not consider the scalar perturbations because leaver s method can not be directly applied to the scalar case . comparing the expanded eigenfunction ( [ expansion ] ) with equation ( [ expwr ] )",
    ", we can see that the eigenfunction ( [ expansion ] ) satisfies the qnm boundary condition ( [ def - bc ] ) if the power series in equation ( [ expansion ] ) converges for @xmath51 .",
    "this convergence condition is equivalent to the condition written in terms of continued fractions @xcite , which is given by @xmath52 therefore , we solve this algebraic equation to obtain the quasinormal frequency .",
    "in this study , we are concerned with asymptotic behaviors of high - order qnms , namely quasinormal frequencies with large imaginary parts , in almost the extremal limit , in which two horizons are quite near .",
    "we therefore consider only the case of @xmath53 .",
    "for these small values of @xmath0 , the continued fractions ( [ a - eq1 ] ) converge very quickly and leaver s method works quite well even when quasinormal frequencies have quite large imaginary parts . note that for moderate values of @xmath0 , however , the convergence of the continued fractions gets worse and leaver s method is applicable only for modes with smaller imaginary frequencies . for those cases , thus , some other techniques such as nollert s method @xcite or a phase integral method @xcite should be used to obtain high - order qnms .    in order to check our numerical code",
    ", we have calculated fundamental frequencies of the qnms for several values of @xmath0 and have fitted the mode frequencies as a function of @xmath0 with the polynomials defined by @xmath54 recently , cardoso and lemos @xcite and maasse van den brink @xcite analytically obtained the expansion coefficients , which are given by @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mode number .",
    "it is found that numerically obtained coefficients are in good agreement with coefficients given by ( [ ana - coef1 ] ) and ( [ ana - coef2 ] ) .",
    "note that our numerical results for the mode frequencies are consistent with those obtained by moss and norman @xcite , who studied low - order qnms of the gravitational perturbations for full range of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "first , let us discuss properties of the quasinormal frequencies for the low - order modes . in figure 1 , we show the real parts of the frequencies for the low - order qnms versus the imaginary parts of the frequencies for the gravitational perturbations with @xmath58 . in this figure ,",
    "non - dimensional frequencies @xmath59 have been plotted as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the dashed curve indicates the approximate frequency for @xmath63 , derived by cardoso and lemos @xcite ( see , also @xcite ) . for low - order modes , figure 1 illustrates how the frequencies of the qnms behaves when the mode number and/or the value of @xmath0 is altered .",
    "basic properties of the low - order qnms are summarized as follows : for the modes associated with a small mode number , the real parts of the frequencies decrease with the increase of the imaginary parts of the frequency , even though the real parts of the frequency are constant in the approximation formula ( [ w - exp])-([ana - coef2 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the analytical approximation formula in the extremal limit ( [ w - exp])-([ana - coef2 ] ) is quite good for the fundamental modes as long as @xmath0 is small enough , while , as expected in @xcite , this approximation formula gets worse as the mode number is increased even for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "this means that formula ( [ w - exp])-([ana - coef2 ] ) does not give a correct asymptotic value of the qnm frequencies in the limit of large imaginary frequencies .",
    "similar properties can be seen for other perturbations having different @xmath64 and @xmath33 . in figure 2",
    ", we show the same results as those in figure 1 but for the electromagnetic perturbations having @xmath65 .",
    "it is observed that similar behaviors of the qnm frequencies are seen in the case of electromagnetic perturbations , too .",
    "now , we explain our numerical results for the asymptotic behavior of the qnm of nearly extremal sds spacetimes in the limit of large imaginary frequencies . in figure 3 , we plot the imaginary parts of the non - dimensional qnm frequencies , @xmath66 , of the gravitational perturbations with @xmath58 as a function of the mode number @xmath57 . in this figure ,",
    "the model parameter is @xmath61 .",
    "the figure shows that an asymptotic form of @xmath67 , which is similar to the analytical formula ( [ w - exp])-([ana - coef2 ] ) , is a good approximation for the imaginary parts in the limit of large imaginary frequencies .",
    "the same asymptotic form is inferred in all other qnm s we have calculated in the present study , regardless of the values of @xmath0 , @xmath33 , and @xmath64 .",
    "let us next focus on the behaviors of the real part of the qnm frequencies in the limit of highly damped modes . in figures 4 and 5 , the real parts of the non - dimensional mode frequencies ,",
    "@xmath66 are plotted as a function of the imaginary parts of the frequencies up to sufficiently high - order modes for the @xmath68 gravitational and for the @xmath69 electromagnetic perturbations , respectively .",
    "the results for the model parameter of @xmath61 are shown in both figures .",
    "it is found that the real parts of the frequencies show oscillating behaviors as the imaginary parts of the frequencies are increased .",
    "it is important to note that similar oscillating behaviors have been observed in the qnms of a reissner - nordstr \" om black hole .",
    "( the quasinormal frequencies with large imaginary frequency of a reissner - nordstr \" om black hole can be given in terms of a solution of the algebraic equation @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath9 are contents determined with the mass and charge of the black hole ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "as shown by neitzke @xcite and anderson and howls @xcite , equation ( [ rne ] ) has an infinite number of solutions and some solutions of equation ( [ rne ] ) show periodicity . )",
    "the behavior of the amplitude of the oscillating @xmath59 as a function of @xmath60 resembles that of qnm frequencies of a schwarzschild black hole",
    ". for the gravitational perturbations , the amplitude decreases for small values of @xmath60 , approaches the imaginary axis of the complex frequency plan , increases again , and finally approaches some constant value .",
    "the asymptotic value of the amplitude in the limit of highly damped modes seems to be non - zero constant , which is inferred as @xmath72 .",
    "therefore the limit of @xmath59 as @xmath73 appears not to exist for the gravitational perturbations .",
    "for the electromagnetic perturbations , on the other hand , the amplitude of oscillating @xmath59 decreases monotonically as @xmath60 is increased .",
    "its asymptotic value in the limit of highly damped modes seems to be zero .",
    "this means that for the electromagnetic perturbations , the limit of @xmath59 as @xmath60 goes to infinity seems to exist and to be zero .",
    "it is important to note that in a nearly extremal sds black hole , the asymptotic behaviors of the quasinormal frequencies in the limit of highly damped modes are independent of the angular quantum number @xmath33 of the perturbations .",
    "although we do not show the results for other values of @xmath0 and @xmath33 , the asymptotic behavior of the qnm frequencies is not highly dependent on these parameters . in summary",
    ", our numerical results suggest that for the gravitational perturbations , the real parts of the qnm frequencies of nearly extremal sds spacetimes do not go to any constant value in the limit of large imaginary frequencies because they show oscillating behaviors in the limit . for the electromagnetic perturbations ,",
    "on the other hand , the real parts of the qnm frequencies seem to go to zero in the limit of large imaginary frequencies .",
    "we have calculated the high - order qnms with large imaginary frequencies for the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in nearly extremal sds spacetimes using leaver s continued fraction method @xcite .",
    "our results show that for low - order qnms , analytical formulas in the extremal limit derived by cardoso and lemos @xcite and maassen van den brink @xcite is a quite good approximation for the qnm frequencies as long as the model parameter @xmath0 is small enough . for high - order qnms ,",
    "whose imaginary frequencies are sufficiently large , on the other hand , this formula becomes inaccurate even for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the approximation derived by cardoso and lemos can not give correct asymptotic behaviors of the qnms in the limit of large imaginary frequencies ( see , also @xcite ) .",
    "we also found that the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies have oscillating behaviors in the limit of highly damped modes .",
    "( similar behaviors have been found in the quasinormal frequencies in a reissner - nordstr \" om black hole @xcite . )",
    "the amplitude of oscillating @xmath3 approaches a non - zero constant value for the gravitational perturbations and zero for the electromagnetic perturbations in the limit of highly damped modes , regardless of values of @xmath33 and @xmath0 .",
    "this means that for the gravitational perturbations , the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies of nearly extremal sds spacetimes appear not to go to any constant value in the limit of highly damped modes .",
    "therefore our numerical results suggest that hod s conjecture is not applicable for nearly extremal sds black holes because the the limit of @xmath3 as @xmath74 does not exist .",
    "although we computed high - order qnms whose damping rates are quite large , all the qnms we obtained in this study are still associated with a finite mode number but not infinity , because we investigated the properties of the qnms with straightforward numerical approach .",
    "thus , we can not exclude the possibility that our numerical results do not show correct asymptotic behaviors .",
    "other approaches to examine asymptotic behaviors of qnms in the highly damping limit are necessary , in order to confirm our results of the asymptotic behaviors . as for high - order qnms with large imaginary frequencies for moderate values of @xmath0 , leaver s method can not be applied straightforwardly .",
    "therefore , other numerical techniques are needed to obtain qnms with large imaginary frequencies .",

    "] ) satisfies three conditions above , as shown in @xcite , two potentials @xmath96 give the same transmission amplitude and the same quasinormal frequencies . in a sds spacetime , therefore , axial and polar perturbations yield the same set of quasinormal mode frequencies .",
    "this iso - spectral properties in a sds spacetime is attributed to the fact that gravitational perturbations associated with a spin @xmath97 in a sds spacetime can be described with a single weyl scalar @xmath98 @xcite .    in a schwarzschild - anti - de sitter spacetime",
    ", exactly the same relations between polar and axial perturbations ( [ a4])([a6 ] ) obviously hold @xcite . yet , there is no iso - spectral property between polar and axial perturbations in a schwarzschild - anti - de sitter spacetime . in a schwarzschild - anti - de sitter spacetime ,",
    "the master equation ( [ a1 ] ) does not have an asymptotic solution given by @xmath99 as @xmath100 and , furthermore , @xmath30 has a finite range .",
    "the boundary condition at spatial infinity therefore must be modified .",
    "one of the plausible boundary conditions is that perturbation functions vanish at spatial infinity , even though there are other options for the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "if this boundary condition is taken at spatial infinity , in general , the transformation ( [ a6 ] ) between polar and axial perturbations can not hold this boundary condition .",
