    "one drawback is the complex handling of the molten salt fuel inside the ( recycling ) circuit : important care must be taken for controlling the physico - chemical conditions@xcite , and additional efforts have to be made on the development of adapted structure materials  @xcite .    the knowledge on molten fluoride salts chemistry has long remained fragmented and limited to a few experimental techniques ( mainly electrochemical ones ) due to experimental hindrances .",
    "one has to deal with high temperatures ( from 500  k to 1800  k ) and to control the corrosive properties by setting up original experiments .",
    "many efforts have been made towards this direction and several experimental techniques have been adapted to the study of molten salts .",
    "the development of new cells has unlocked the study of molten fluorides by exafs spectroscopy  @xcite , which , coupled to other spectroscopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonnance ( nmr )  @xcite or raman  @xcite , is able to provide a view of the local structure in these melts . as for the dynamic properties ,",
    "similar improvements have been made and the self - diffusion coefficients can be measured up to 1500  k by pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance ( pfg - nmr )  @xcite .",
    "such measurements are important since the diffusion coefficients provide an information on the _ individual _ dynamics of the ions , complementing the viscosity or electrical conductivity measurements which inform about the _ collective _ dynamics of the macroscopic system .    during the past decade ,",

    "both ratios hardly vary , showing that the diffusion of fluoride is barely impacted by the presence of yttrium ions , even at high yf@xmath0 concentrations .",
    "on the other hand , we have already mentioned that the nernst - einstein approximation overestimates the electrical conductivity of lif - yf@xmath0 molten salts by 10 to 20  % , independently of the composition . such a relatively good agreement is usually observed in molten alkali halides , _",

    "<S> the transport properties of molten lif - yf@xmath0 mixtures have been studied by pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , potentiometric experiments , and molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated diffusion coefficients and electric conductivities compare very well with the measurements across a wide composition range . </S>",
    "<S> we then extract static ( radial distribution functions , coordination numbers distributions ) and dynamic ( cage correlation functions ) quantities from the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> then , we discuss the interplay between the microscopic structure of the molten salts and their dynamic properties . it is often considered that variations in the diffusion coefficient of the anions are mainly driven by the evolution of its coordination with the metallic ion ( y@xmath1 here ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this system with fluorozirconate melts and demonstrate that the coordination number is a poor indicator of the evolution of the diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we propose to use the ionic bonds lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the weak y - f ionic bonds in lif - yf@xmath0 do not induce the expected tendency of the fluoride diffusion coefficient to converge toward the one of yttrium cation when the content in yf@xmath0 increases . </S>",
    "<S> implications on the validity of the nernst - einstein relation for estimating the electrical conductivity are discussed . </S>"
