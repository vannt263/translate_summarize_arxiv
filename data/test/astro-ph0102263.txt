    "we show that b1a and b1b are spatially extended .",
    "they are , however , very compact objects : too compact to be easily modelled as spiral galaxy disks .",
    "they appear to show colour gradients : bluer in their central regions .    in figures  [ rpsf ] and [ jpsf ]",
    "we compare the radial profiles of b1a and b1b with the relevant point spread functions ( psfs ) measured from a bright star in the same image . b1a and b1b are marginally resolved in the f702w ( rest - frame 2100  ) and f110w ( rest - frame 3250  ) images .",

    "spheroidal models give best fits for effective ( half - light ) radii @xmath116 of around @xmath117  ( @xmath118 kpc ) , which are typical of modern elliptical galaxies .",
    "models which combine a nuclear spheroid or point source with a disk can give acceptable fits , but only if the disk is unusually small and/or contributes only a small fraction ( @xmath119 10% ) of the light .",

    "curiously , both b1a and b1b appear to be significantly larger at longer wavelengths .",
    "this can be seen in figures  [ rpsf ] and [ jpsf ] : despite the wider psf for the f110w filter , both components are clearly more extended than as seen through the f702w filter .",

    "the change in size as a function of wavelength could be explained by a colour gradient within a single spheroidal component .",
    "it could also be explained by a two component model : a compact blue component that dominates at rest - frame 2100  and a more diffuse ( but still compact ) red component that dominates at 3250  and beyond . this red component , if disk - like , must have @xmath121 , which would still place it in the most compact 1% of low redshift disks .",
    "what are the continuum components of b1 ?",
    "b1c , with its blue colors , appears relatively straightforward : it is a region of extended moderate star formation , obscured by little dust .",
    "this star formation may be triggered by the interaction of b1a and b1b .",
    "the nature of b1a and b1b is less straightforward .",
    "we consider four models in turn .      could b1a and b1b be young elliptical galaxies ?",
    "this hypothesis fits the data well .    *",
    "the radial profiles of b1a and b1b are well fit with de vaucouleurs profiles , and the inferred radii are typical of present - day elliptical galaxies . * the red colors are most easily explained by a @xmath122 stellar population which completed its star formation about 750 myr before we observe it",

    "were these components at low redshift , their surface brightnesses at the effective radius would be @xmath126 .",
    "this is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the kormendy relation would predict for an elliptical galaxy of this radius .",
    "this is consistent with passive evolution from our unreddened burst model ( section  [ sed ] ) .    if b1a and b1b are elliptical galaxies , why do they apparently show color gradients ?",
    "the uv emission from the central @xmath52 kpc could be caused by a starburst , a hole in the dust or ( for b1b ) an agn .",
    "alternatively , some chemodynamical models predict color gradients in young elliptical galaxies ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a dusty agn can certainly have colors as red as b1a and b1b ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "the red components of b1a and b1b are however spatially extended , and hence can not be produced by an agn .",
    "could the observed color gradient , however , be caused by the superposition of a compact blue agn on a more extended , lower surface brightness red galaxy ?    even in the relatively blue central regions , the continuum slope is redder than @xmath127 , while radio - quiet qsos have typical continuum slopes of @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "any central agn would thus have to be reddened by dust with @xmath129 .",
    "this would make it hard for the ly@xmath1 emission from b1b to escape .",
    "in addition , the agn in b1a and b1b would need remarkably equal luminosities and dust extinctions to explain the very similar observed colors and radial profiles of the two components .",
    "this fine tuning seems implausible .",
    "furthermore , the high measured surface brightness was measured in the f160w band , to which the central blue component does not significantly contribute .",
    "we therefore conclude that while agn may be present , they are unlikely to be responsible for the observed colors .",
    "sensitive hard x - ray or far - ir observations will be required to determine whether a dusty agn is present .",
    "the more extended red component of b1a and b1b can be fit by a very compact exponential disk .",
    "could these two objects then be compact spiral galaxies ?",
    "the more compact bluer central component could be caused by agns or nuclear starbursts .    with sufficient dust",
    ", a spiral galaxy can certainly appear as red as these two components ( section  [ sedmodel ] ) .",
    "two lines of reasoning however oppose this hypothesis .    1 .",
    "even the extended red components are extremely compact by the standards of modern disk galaxies . this could , however , be explained if disk galaxies form from the inside outwards .",
    "this model requires that the outer ( red ) components of b1a and b1b be greatly reddened .",
    "this would make it difficult for the observed uv light and ly@xmath1 emission from the bluer central components to escape",
    ".      could b1a and b1b be the bulges of two disk galaxies ?",
    "the disks themselves may not have formed , or might be too low in surface brightness to be detected by the hubble space telescope .",
    "two lines of reasoning oppose this hypothesis .",
    "firstly , the red colors and @xmath27-band peak of b1 are seen in our ground - based photometry with large ( @xmath130 ) apertures .",
    "thus any extended component must have a similar stellar population to that inferred here .",
    "secondly , the inferred masses and sizes for b1a and b1b are far larger than those typical of the bulges of disk galaxies .",
    "b1 has a total ly@xmath1 luminosity of @xmath131 , spread over a region at least @xmath132 kpc in size .",
    "the emission consists of a number of diffuse , discrete components with relative velocities of @xmath88 .",
    "what can produce such a luminous , diffuse , fast moving ly@xmath1 nebula ?",
    "the bulk motions of the ly@xmath1 nebula suggest that fast shocks must be present .",
    "we will show that such shocks are quite capable of producing the observed ly@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "the puzzle then becomes one of explaining the origins of the bulk motions .",
    "it has also been suggested that photoionzation by an agn , or a cooling flow may power such nebulae .",
    "we discuss these possibilities , which are hard to exclude .",
    "if we assume that the ly@xmath1 velocities are representative of the gas , and not an artifact of the high optical depth in ly@xmath1 , then the dynamical timescale ( crossing time ) of the nebula is @xmath133 years .",
    "this is interestingly similar to the inferred age of the stellar population ( section  [ sed ] ) .    what is the density of the nebula ?",
    "the sight - line to background qso 2139@xmath04434 passes 20  from b1 ( though it does not pass through the ly@xmath1 nebula ) .",
    "the qso spectrum shows a strong absorption - line system at the redshift of b1 , with a column density @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the column density through the ly@xmath1 nebula is at least as great as this , and that the nebula is @xmath83 kpc thick ( ie . as thick as it is wide ) along the line of sight ( both big assumptions ) , then its density must be at least @xmath135 . if , however , the density were this low , the gas would be fully ionized by the metagalactic uv background at this redshift .",
    "if the nebula is @xmath83 kpc thick , it must have a density of @xmath136 for its recombination rate to balance the photoionization from the uv background @xcite .",
    "the diffuse star formation of b1c , taking place within part of the ly@xmath1 nebula , also suggests that densities may be higher . in reality , of course , the cloud may be highly inhomogeneous , with dense neutral ` bullets ' embedded in low density ionized gas .",
    "if we take this lower limit on the density of the nebula ( @xmath137 ) , and assume that the nebula is 100 kpc long , 30 kpc wide and 10 kpc thick , then its hydrogen mass is @xmath138 .",
    "whenever there are blobs of gas moving at supersonic relative speeds , as are observed in the nebula , shocks are inevitable .",
    "we thus know that shocks are present .",
    "could the emission from these shocks produce the observed ly@xmath1 emission ?",
    "we used the fast shock models computed with the mappings  iii code to calculate the line emission from the shocks .",
    "mappings  iii is an updated version of the mappings  ii code @xcite and uses improved radiation continuum and hydrogenic calculations to calculate the line and continuum radiation from shocks .",
    "the new version of the code enabled the calculation of a grid of shocks for a range of metallicities , up to 1000 km / s , although a small number of low metallicity models above @xmath139 failed to converge after several global iterations .",
    "a fiducial model with a velocity of @xmath140 was used here , having achieved a converged solution over a range of metallicities .    if the shocks are radiative , and if we assume , for example , a density of @xmath141 , then the ly@xmath1 emissivity will be @xmath142 , almost independent of the metallicity of the gas .",
    "a quarter of this comes from the shock itself , the rest coming from photoionization of the assumed neutral gas in front of the shock ( the precursor region ) .",
    "if the shock is face - on to our sight - line , this would correspond to an observed surface brightness of @xmath143 : nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the observed ly@xmath1 surface brightness ( section  [ results ] ) .",
    "much of this may be self absorbed , but if even 1% escapes , it can explain our observations .",
    "the predicted ly@xmath1/ ratio is also consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "how does this vary with the assumed density of the gas ? if the shocks are radiative , the emissivity will scale roughly with the density .",
    "thus even with our lower limit on the density @xmath144 ( section  [ lines ] ) , shocks can produce all the ly@xmath1 we observe .    would these shocks be radiative ? for our lower limit on the density ,",
    "@xmath145 shocks become radiative on a timescale of @xmath133 years , which is comparable to the dynamical timescale .",
    "thus it seems likely that at least some fraction of the shocks will be radiative .",
    "thus shocks are probably present , and can easily produce the ly@xmath1 emission we observe . a number of factors could , however , suppress the ly@xmath1 emission from shocks .    1 .",
    "the high optical depth in ly@xmath1 may have caused us to overestimate the velocity dispersion of the ly@xmath1 nebula .",
    "the emission from shocks is a strong function of their velocity : @xmath146 shocks emit two orders of magnitude less ly@xmath1 per unit area than our fiducial model .",
    "2 .   the density of the ly@xmath1 nebula may be close to our lower limit of @xmath144 , in which case the ly@xmath1 emission , after the probable self absorption losses , could be an order of magnitude below the observed ly@xmath1 surface brightness .",
    "3 .   the ly@xmath1 nebula could consist of small dense ` bullets ' of neutral gas , moving at high speeds through a hot , highly ionized , low density medium .",
    "the bowshocks in the ionized medium would not be radiative , while the reverse shocks within the ` bullets ' would be slow , and hence have low surface brightnesses ( as well as having a small area ) .",
    "if the shock model is correct , the bulk gas motions explain the ly@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "what then could be the energy source for the bulk gas motions ?",
    "if we divide the total kinetic energy of the nebula ( assuming a mass of @xmath147 ) by the ly@xmath1 luminosity , we can derive an upper limit on the damping time , which is @xmath148 years .",
    "this is less than the dynamical timescale and stellar age of b1 , suggesting that continued energy input is required .",
    "note that the ly@xmath1 we observe may only be a small fraction of the ly@xmath1 emitted , which in turn will only be a small fraction ( @xmath52% ) of the total energy dissipation in the shocks . on the other hand",
    ", the gas mass may be greater than we are assuming .",
    "if continued energy input is required , what can the source be ?",
    "perhaps the most natural energy source is the gravitational potential energy of b1 .",
    "if we assume that b1 has a total mass of @xmath149 , then the gravitational potential energy released in its formation would be @xmath150 ergs , which is more than sufficient to power the ly@xmath1 luminosity for the dynamical timescale .",
    "such a mass for b1 would imply virial velocities in the ly@xmath1 nebula of @xmath151 , which are comparable to the bulk gas motions observed .",
    "this energy could be released by the merger of b1a and b1b , or by a continuing mass infall rate of @xmath152 .",
    "@xcite point out that chemically primordial gas at a temperature of @xmath153 k has few cooling mechanisms other than ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "thus if most of the gas around b1 is primordial , a ly@xmath1 luminosity comparable to the gravitational binding energy ( section  [ energy ] ) of the system must be radiated .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that galactic superwinds driven by a starburst could power extended ly@xmath1 nebulae .",
    "this would naturally explain the similarity between the dynamical timescale and the inferred age of the stellar population in b1a and b1b .",
    "the maximum plausible amount of energy which star formation can inject into the intergalactic medium is @xmath154 ( eg .",
    "as b1a and b1b have a combined stellar mass of @xmath155 , the total energy liberated would be @xmath156 ergs , which could in principle drive the observed ly@xmath1 luminosity for @xmath157 years .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission in high redshift radio galaxies has sometimes been ascribed to mechanical energy deposition by a radio jet ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "could such a jet be present in b1 ?",
    "we do not detect any radio emission from b1 @xcite .",
    "our @xmath82 upper limit of 0.23 mjy at 2.4 ghz corresponds to a luminosity limit of @xmath158 at rest - frame 1.4 ghz ( assuming a typical radio galaxy radio spectrum of the form @xmath159 ) .",
    "typical ratios of the total jet mechanical power to the monochromatic radio flux at 1.4 ghz are @xmath160@xmath161 @xcite .",
    "thus we can place an upper limit of @xmath162 on the energy injection from a radio jet .",
    "this is sufficient to power the observed ly@xmath1 luminosity only if @xmath163% of the mechanical energy is converted into observable ly@xmath1 emission , which seems implausible .",
    "deeper radio observations should test this hypothesis .      if the shock emission is suppressed , is there an alternative mechanism capable of producing the ly@xmath1 emission ?",
    "stellar ionisation ( by hot young stars ) is incapable of producing the observed emission .",
    "photoionisation by the uv continuum radiation from a qso can , however , produce both the ly@xmath1 and , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we do not see strong uv continuum emission from any component of b1 , so such an agn would have to be concealed from our sight - line . @xcite",
    "detected strong sub - mm emission from a ly@xmath1 blob at @xmath164 , suggesting that a dusty agn or starburst was present , but we have no evidence for such a source in b1 .",
    "extended emission - line nebulosities are associated with many low redshift cooling flow clusters , such as ngc 1275 .",
    "as all high - redshift ly@xmath1 blobs seem to lie in cluster environments , could the ly@xmath1 luminosity be associated with a cooling flow ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that ly@xmath1 nebulae are caused by gas cooling from higher temperatures , in such a cooling flow . if each cooling hydrogen atom produces one ly@xmath1 photon , however , we require that @xmath165 of hydrogen be cooling onto b1",
    ". this would build the observed baryonic mass of b1 in @xmath166 years .",
    "this is far smaller than either the dynamical time or the age of the stellar population in b1a and b1b , so the simple cooling model seems implausible .",
    "note that the nebular emission - line luminosities of low redshift cooling - flow clusters are also orders of magnitude too great to be explained by this simple recombination mechanism ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is still controversial even at low redshifts .    on purely energetic grounds , could the ly@xmath1 luminosity be powered by the thermal energy in the nebula ?",
    "if we divide the thermal energy of @xmath167 of hydrogen at @xmath168 k by the observed ly@xmath1 luminosity , we get a timescale of @xmath148 years : shorter than the dynamical timescale or the stellar age .",
    "@xmath167 may however be an underestimate of the true gaseous mass of the ly@xmath1 nebula , particularly if the neutral gas we observe is immersed in a much more massive cloud of hot , highly ionised x - ray emitting gas .",
    "so what is b1 ? on balance , we conclude that b1a and b1b are probably young elliptical galaxies , perhaps analogues of e@xmath123a galaxies today .",
    "both their red colors and compact sizes are naturally explained by this model .",
    "an extremely dusty starburst in the central regions of a disk galaxy can however , with some fine tuning , reproduce the colors and sizes .",
    "the bluer colors of the centres of both components , and the ly@xmath1 emission from the core of b1b are , however , arguments against the presence of large amounts of dust in these systems .",
    "near - ir h - band spectroscopy on an 8m - class telescope should resolve this ambiguity , by detecting the spectral signatures of a balmer/4000break .",
    "b1c appears to be a region of relatively unobscured star formation , perhaps induced by the interaction of b1a and b1b .",
    "if b1a and b1b are elliptical galaxies , their surface brightnesses are an order of magnitude greater than those that the kormendy relation would predict for galaxies of this size , and they show strong radial color gradients , with blue cores . the very existence of massive elliptical galaxies at this redshift , if confirmed , is interesting ( eg .",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these galaxies would give us a chance to study young elliptical galaxies for the first time .",
    "our observations would pose several puzzles :    * why is the surface brightness of these galaxies so great ? is this simply due to passive evolution ? * why do both galaxies show strong , but very similar color gradients ?",
    "* is the remarkable similarity and proximity of the two galaxies coincidental , or is it telling us something about how cluster elliptical galaxies form ? * if these galaxies are so massive and red at @xmath169 , what would they have looked like at @xmath170 when they were forming ?",
    "the nature of the ly@xmath1 nebula is less well constrained by our observations .",
    "the nebula could be excited by photoionization from an agn , by whatever powers low redshift cooling flow nebulae , or by fast shocks powered by either superwinds or gravitational potential energy .",
