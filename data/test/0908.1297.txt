    "recent years have seen a renewed interest in the study of photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons off complex nuclei at few gev energies due to the advent of high duty - cycle electron accelerators together with new photon tagging facilities and novel experimental technologies .",
    "it has now become possible to perform photoproduction cross section measurements of pseudoscalar mesons off nuclei with a percent level accuracy .",
    "photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons off nuclei at small angles , + a ps+a   ( ps = ^0 , , ^ ) , [ eq1 ] is provided mainly by the possibility of extraction of their radiative decay widths from experimental data .",
    "these reactions at small angles proceed via production in the coulomb field of a heavy nucleus , the primakoff effect  @xcite . on the other hand , photoproduction in the nuclear strong field",
    "complicates the extraction of decay widths from experimental data and requires detail theoretical examination .",
    "the precision measurement of @xmath2 radiative decay width via the primakoff effect in the photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons off nuclear targets has recently been completed at jefferson lab  @xcite .",
    "the energy upgrade of the cebaf accelerator to 12 gev will provide a great opportunity to extend the current program to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons .    in a recent article  @xcite we discussed that a precise knowledge of the radiative decay widths of light pseudoscalar mesons provide an accurate test of chiral anomalies and mixing effects that are due to isospin breaking by the difference of the masses of light quarks .",
    "this is of great importance to understand fundamental properties of qcd at low energies  @xcite .",
    "the precision extraction of the decay widths requires state - of - the - art theoretical descriptions of all processes participating in the reaction . in our recent work",
    "@xcite we considered explicitly the photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons in the coulomb field of nuclei and their coherent photoproduction off the nuclear strong field . in the present work we will consider the incoherent photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons off nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ , + a ps+a^. [ eq2 ] here @xmath5 is the target final state including all possible nuclear excitations and its breakup . as in our previous work  @xcite , here we will discuss the incoherent photoproduction of @xmath2 meson bearing in mind that the obtained expressions , after obvious modifications , can be applied to photoproduction of the other pseudoscalar mesons .    the necessity for such investigations is two - fold . as mentioned above , the advent of precise experimental data demands the accuracy of theoretical predictions to be at relevant levels .",
    "thus , the widely used expressions for the incoherent photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite can not be considered as satisfactory .",
    "the reason for this is that the nucleon spin - nonflip amplitude is zero at zero production angle due to conservation of angular momentum .",
    "as was first shown by fldt  @xcite , such behavior of the nucleon amplitude requires particular consideration for the coherent photoproduction process off nuclei . on the other hand , in the incoherent production ,",
    "as we will show later , similar corrections to the cross section take place and their neglect leads to meaningless results for the incoherent photoproduction at forward angles .    despite the fact that the incoherent production off nuclei in non - diffractive processes was considered in the works of fldt  @xcite ,",
    "we are compelled to study this process again since the expressions obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite are not suitable for the production at small angles .",
    "pauli suppression is at work for production at small angles and its correct accounting is crucial for the process under consideration .",
