    "the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state is predicted for clean spin - singlet superconductors as a result of the competition between pairing correlations , favoring anti - parallel spin alignment , and the zeeman effect , favoring parallel spin alignment along the field.@xcite the compromise is a spatially inhomogeneous state of `` normal '' and `` superconducting '' regions .",
    "the `` normal '' regions are defined by a spectrum of spin - polarized quasiparticles .",
    "the high - field fflo phase was originally suggested for superconductors with ferromagnetically aligned impurities,@xcite but it was soon realized that a fflo state should develop in superconductors in an external field if the zeeman coupling dominates the orbital coupling.@xcite    a number of layered organic superconductors have been suggested as candidates for fflo phases.@xcite however , recent interest has focussed on the heavy - fermion material cecoin@xmath0.@xcite this material has quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) metallic planes , and shows evidence of unconventional , @xmath1-wave , superconductivity@xcite with a transition temperature of @xmath2 .",

    "generally both spin and orbital coupling to the field are present .",

    "we presented self - consistently calculated phase diagram of the fflo state of a two - dimensional @xmath1-wave superconductor within the quasiclassical theory .",
    "we found that the larkin - ovchinnikov state is favored over the fulde - ferrell state in two dimensions .",
    "the oscillations of the order parameter amplitude along the nodal @xmath33 direction for the gap function @xmath101 is stable over most of the fflo phase diagram .",
    "however , for one - dimensional stripes the state with @xmath34 orientation is stable in the ultra - high @xmath29 region of the phase diagram and below @xmath79 .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath9 transitions are of second order .",
    "the order parameter vanishes continuously at the upper critical field @xmath8 . at the lower critical field",
    "@xmath9 a single domain wall , similar to a bloch domain wall , signals the onset of the nonuniform fflo state .",
    "the local density of states calculations suggest that the andreev resonance spectrum may be used to identify experimentally the intrinsic structure of the fflo phases .",
    "in particular , the topological andreev bound state is shifted from zero energy by an applied magnetic field .",
    "all the quasiparticle resonances live in regions where the order parameter is suppressed .",
    "thus their spatial distribution depends on the wave length of the nonuniform modulations , which are controlled by the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "besides the characteristic energy dependence of the resonances , their spatial periodicity in the fflo state enables us to tell them apart from random impurities in scanning tunneling microscopy measurements .",
    "finally , we note that the phase diagram calculated for the model two - dimensional @xmath1-wave superconductor does not resemble the experimental phase diagram of cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the identification of the observed phase transition in cecoin@xmath0 with a fflo phase of a @xmath1-wave superconductor is either incorrect , or inconclusive and a more detailed model for the fflo phases in this system needs to be implemented , e.g. , a model with includes impurity scattering effects , fermi liquid effects ( e.g. , exchange interactions ) , orbital magnetization effects as well as more realistic fermi surface topology .",
    "all of these materials effects are known to result in changes to the order and the location of the phase transition lines .",
