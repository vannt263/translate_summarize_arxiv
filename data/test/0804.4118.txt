    "the idea that entanglement may be used as a resource is central to the theory of quantum communication and cryptography .",
    "well - known examples include teleportation @xcite and the super - dense coding of both classical and quantum data @xcite . in cryptography ,",
    "entanglement is used not only in some implementations of quantum key - distribution @xcite , but also as a mathematical tool in security proofs @xcite of quantum key - distribution protocols not based on entanglement ( such as @xcite ) . in these settings",
    "it may be said that the relationship between entanglement and other resources ( in particular quantum communication , classical communication , and private shared randomness ) is reasonably well - understood @xcite .",
    "there are , on the other hand , settings of interest where the properties of entanglement as a resource are very poorly understood .",
    "one example can be found in quantum communication complexity , wherein it is not known if prior shared entanglement ever gives an asymptotic reduction in the number of qubits of communication required to solve general communication problems @xcite . a second example , which is the main focus of this paper , concerns the power of entanglement in the multi - prover interactive proof system model , which has been studied in several recent papers @xcite . bell inequalities @xcite , and many of the open problems concerning them @xcite , have a fundamental connection to this model ( although not necessarily to our main results ) .",
    "multi - prover interactive proof systems , which were first defined by ben - or , goldwasser , kilian , and wigderson @xcite , involve interactions among a _",
    "verifier _ and two or more _",
    "provers_. the verifier is always assumed to be efficiently implementable , while the provers are typically permitted to have arbitrary complexity .",
    "the verifier and provers each receive a copy of some input string @xmath0 , and then engage in an interaction based on this string . during this interaction",
    "the verifier communicates privately with each of the provers , possibly over the course of many rounds of communication , but the provers are forbidden from communicating directly with one another .",
    "the provers may , however , agree on a joint strategy before the interaction begins .",
    "the provers act in collaboration to convince the verifier that the input string @xmath0 is a _ yes - input _ to some fixed problem , and therefore should be _ accepted_. the provers are not , however , considered to be trustworthy , and so the verifier must be defined in such a way that it _ rejects _ strings that are _ no - inputs _ to the problem being considered .",
    "these two conditions  that the provers can convince the verifier to accept yes - inputs but can not convince the verifier to accept no - inputs  are called the _ completeness _ and _ soundness _ conditions , respectively , and are analogous to the notions in mathematical logic that share these names .",
    "in contrast to the notion of a mathematical proof , however , one typically requires only that the completeness and soundness conditions for interactive proof systems hold with high probability ( for every fixed yes or no input string ) .",
    "the study of interactive proof systems , including single - prover and multi - prover models , has had an enormous impact on the fields of computational complexity and theoretical cryptography @xcite .",
    "in particular , multi - prover interactive proof systems , and the characterization of their expressive power @xcite , led to the discovery of the _ pcp _ ( or _ probabilistically checkable proof _ ) _ theorem _",
    "@xcite , which was a critical breakthrough in understanding the hardness of approximation problems .    in the quantum setting",
    ", one must consider the possibility that the provers initially share entanglement , which they might use as part of their strategy during the interaction . with this seemingly small change ,",
    "nearly everything we know about classical multi - prover interactive proof systems becomes invalid within the quantum model .",
    "the following points illustrate the effect of this change on our current state of knowledge .",
    "* when the provers are not allowed to share prior entanglement , it is known that the class of promise problems that have multi - prover interactive proof systems is precisely , the class of problems that can be solved nondeterministically in exponential time .",
    "this holds for both classical @xcite and quantum @xcite multi - prover interactive proofs .",
    "* there are no nontrivial bounds known for the class of promise problems having multi - prover interactive proofs when the provers initially share entanglement , including the cases of both a classical and quantum verifier . at one extreme",
    ", such proof systems could have the same expressive power as single - prover interactive proof systems , and at the other extreme it is possible that uncomputable problems have such proof systems .",
    "one very basic question about multi - prover interactive proofs with entangled provers has remained unanswered , and is closely related to the lack of good upper bounds on their power : _ for a given verifier and input string , how much entanglement is needed for the provers to play optimally ? _ to obtain an upper bound on the expressive power of multi - prover interactive proofs with entangled provers , one seeks a general bound : a limit on the amount of entanglement , as a function of the verifier s description and the given input , needed for the provers to play optimally .",
    "our first main result explains the difficulty in answering this question : we prove that there exist two - prover quantum interactive proof systems for which no finite amount of entanglement allows for an optimal strategy on any fixed input .",
    "in other words , there are interactive proofs such that , no matter what entangled state the provers choose on a given input , it would always be possible for them to do strictly better with more entanglement .",
    "there is , therefore , no strict upper bound of the form discussed above .",
    "this fact has an obvious but important implication : one must consider upper bounds on entanglement for _ close - to - optimal _ strategies if this approach is to yield upper bounds on the power of multi - prover quantum interactive proofs .",
    "our second main result concerns methods to achieve _ perfect completeness _ of quantum interactive proof systems while retaining small soundness error . in the single - prover case , an efficient transformation for doing this exists that is both simple and easy to analyze @xcite . in the multi - prover setting",
    ", an analogous result was recently obtained by kempe , kobayashi , matsumoto , and vidick @xcite based on a much more complicated transformation and analysis .",
    "this more complicated transformation was designed to handle the locality constraints imposed on multiple provers .",
    "it turns out , however , that this complicated procedure is not needed after all , provided one is willing to make a small sacrifice .",
    "we prove that the simple single - prover technique can be applied in the multi - prover case to yield a proof system with _ near - perfect _ completeness : honest provers are able to convince the verifier to accept yes - inputs with any probability smaller than  1 that they desire  but they might never reach probability 1 using finite resources .",
    "( for instance , the provers may choose to cause the verifier to accept yes - inputs with probability @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reciprocal of the busy beaver function .",
    "the implementation of such a strategy , however , could require an enormous amount of prior shared entanglement . )",
    "the two main results just discussed are connected by the notion of _ coherent state exchange _ , which is discussed in the next section . the first main result is then proved in section  [ sec : game ] , while the second is proved in section  [ sec : perfect - completeness ] .",
    "the paper concludes with section  [ sec : conclusion ] . throughout the paper",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with quantum computing and with basic aspects of classical and quantum interactive proof systems .",
    "our notation and terminology are consistent with other papers on these topics .",
    "we begin by defining _",
    "coherent state exchange _ as follows .",
    "consider @xmath3 players @xmath4 ; and suppose , for each @xmath5 , that player @xmath6 holds a quantum system whose associated hilbert space is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "the spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 need not have equal dimension for @xmath9 . for two chosen pure states @xmath10",
    ", we consider the situation in which the players wish to transform a shared copy of @xmath11 into @xmath12 , or vice - versa .",
    "we require that this task is completed _ ( 1 )  without communication _ and _ ( 2 )  by a coherent process_.    to say that a process that performs state exchange is _ coherent _ means that it can be applied in a way that preserves superpositions .",
    "in particular , this means that it is possible for the players to implement a transformation of the form @xmath13 where the first @xmath3 qubits represent control qubits , with one held by each player , and where the state @xmath14 represents an arbitrary state shared by the players .    in the absence of additional resources , it is not possible in general to perform this task when @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , given that the players can not create entanglement out of thin air , the task is easily seen to be impossible when the target state @xmath12 has more entanglement than the initial state  @xmath11 . however , if we consider the situation in which the players initially share an auxiliary quantum state , and we allow this state to be perturbed slightly by the process , then the above impossibility argument based on entanglement is no longer valid  and as we will show , the task indeed becomes possible .",
    "we note that the coherence condition requires that a process of this sort to leave the auxiliary quantum state nearly unchanged , in essence using it as a catalyst .",
    "the players can not , for instance , simply swap the input state @xmath11 with an initially shared copy of @xmath12 without losing coherence .    for the case of @xmath16 , one solution to this problem can be obtained through the use of van  dam and hayden s _ quantum state embezzlement _  @xcite . in quantum state embezzlement , two parties ( alice and bob )",
    "perform a transformation of the form @xmath17 , for some shared entangled state @xmath11 of their choice , where @xmath18 is a special family of states defined so that it is possible to perform such a transformation in which @xmath19 for large @xmath20 .",
    "thus , they `` embezzle '' @xmath11 from @xmath21 , leaving little trace of their crime .",
    "the process for doing this described by van dam and hayden is coherent and requires no communication , and can therefore be done twice ( once in reverse ) to achieve coherent state exchange .",
    "it relies , however , on a representation of two - party pure quantum states that no longer exists for @xmath3-party states when @xmath22 .    here",
    ", we show that coherent state exchange for any number of parties is always possible , with near - perfect coherence . to simplify the description of the procedure",
    ", we will assume that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are orthogonal .",
    "( the more general case where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not necessarily orthogonal is easily handled , and is discussed in the appendix . )",
    "let @xmath20 be a positive integer , which will determine the accuracy of the procedure .",
    "we assume that each player @xmath6 holds @xmath23 identical registers labelled @xmath24 , where each register has an associated hilbert space that is isomorphic to @xmath7 .",
    "we take the initial state of the registers @xmath25 to be @xmath26 and we consider the case where the initial state of the registers @xmath27 is the input state  @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the state represents the entanglement initially shared by @xmath4 .",
    "the procedure that transforms @xmath11 into @xmath12 is simple : each player @xmath6 cyclically shifts the contents of the registers @xmath28 by applying a unitary operation defined by the action @xmath29 on standard basis states .",
    "let us now consider the properties of the above procedure .",
    "it is clear that after the cyclic shift , the registers @xmath27 will contain a perfect copy of @xmath12 , and the remaining registers will contain the state @xmath30 thus , the procedure transforms @xmath31 into @xmath32 .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath33 , so for large @xmath20 there is only a small disturbance to the shared entangled state @xmath21 .",
    "the procedure satisfies the coherence requirement for this reason .    in the case",
    "that the players wished instead to transform @xmath12 to @xmath11 , so that the initial state of the registers @xmath27 is @xmath12 , the same state may be used , but the registers are shifted in the opposite direction .      a notion related to coherent state exchange , known as",
    "_ catalytic transformation _ of pure states , was considered by jonathan and plenio @xcite . in particular",
    ", they considered the situation in which two parties transform one pure state to another ( by local operations and classical communication ) using a catalyst  or a state that assists but is left unchanged by the process .",
    "coherent state exchange ( and embezzlement ) do almost exactly this , and without the exchange of classical information , but in the approximate sense that the catalyst is permitted to change slightly .",
    "as mentioned above , in the case @xmath16 one may use quantum state embezzlement twice to implement coherent state exchange .",
    "the family of states @xmath18 defined in @xcite also has the added property of being _ universal _ , or independent of the state @xmath11 to be embezzled .",
    "we note that it is possible to use our method to give universal embezzling families for all  @xmath3 . to define a universal embezzling family for any fixed @xmath3",
    ", we may consider an @xmath34-net of states @xmath35 in @xmath36 dimensions ( for @xmath37 , say ) , take @xmath38 , and define the embezzling state for each @xmath20 to be the tensor product of all the states @xmath21 ranging over the @xmath39-net .",
    "the embezzlement of a particular state is then performed in the most straightforward way . unlike the families of van dam and hayden for the case @xmath16 ,",
    "our method is highly inefficient , but nevertheless establishes that universal embezzling families exist for all  @xmath3 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to prove the first main result of the paper , which is that there exist two - prover quantum interactive proof systems for which no finite amount of entanglement allows for an optimal strategy on any fixed input .",
    "it suffices to define a two - prover quantum interactive proof system having no dependence on the input @xmath0 ; or , in simpler terms , to consider a cooperative game played by two players and moderated by a referee .",
    "this type of _ cooperative quantum game _ represents a generalization of the _ non - local games _ model of @xcite , where now the referee can send , receive , and process quantum information .    to be more precise , and to aid in the exposition that follows , we define two - player , one - round cooperative quantum games as follows :    1 .",
    "the referee prepares three quantum registers @xmath40 in some chosen state , and then sends @xmath41 to alice and @xmath42 to bob .",
    "alice and bob transform the registers @xmath41 and @xmath42 sent to them however they choose , resulting in registers @xmath43 and @xmath44 that are sent back to the referee .",
    "3 .   the referee performs a binary - valued measurement on the registers @xmath45 .",
    "the outcome  1 means that alice and bob win , while the outcome 0 means that they lose .",
    "the restrictions on alice and bob are the same as for provers in a quantum interactive proof system : they are not permitted to communicate once the game begins , but may agree on a strategy beforehand .",
    "such a strategy may include the sharing of an entangled state of their own choosing , which they may use when transforming the registers sent to them .",
    "the complexity of the referee , which corresponds to the verifier in an interactive proof system , is ignored given that we no longer consider an input string .",
    "consider the two - player cooperative quantum game that is determined by the following specification of the referee :    1 .",
    "let @xmath46 be a qubit register and let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be qutrit registers .",
    "the referee initializes the registers @xmath40 to the state @xmath47 where @xmath48 the registers @xmath41 and @xmath42 are sent to alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the referee receives @xmath43 from alice and @xmath44 from bob , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are both single - qubit registers .",
    "the triple @xmath45 is measured with respect to the projective measurement @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for @xmath52 . in accordance with the conventions stated above",
    ", the outcome 1 means that alice and bob win while 0 means that they lose .",
    "the intuition behind this game is as follows .",
    "alice and bob are presented with two possibilities , in superposition : they receive either the unentangled state @xmath53 or the entangled state @xmath11 .",
    "their goal is essentially to do nothing to @xmath53 and to convert @xmath11 to @xmath54 , for they want the referee to hold the state @xmath55 when the final measurement is made .",
    "these transformations must be done coherently , without measurements or residual evidence of which of the two transformations @xmath56 or @xmath57 was performed , for otherwise the final state of the referee will not have a large overlap with @xmath55 .",
    "the required transformation will be possible using coherent state exchange , with a winning probability approaching 1 .",
    "it will be shown , however , that it is never possible for alice and bob to win with certainty , provided they initially share a finite entangled state .",
    "we now present a family of strategies for alice and bob that win with probability approaching  1 . in the above game",
    ", alice receives @xmath41 from the referee and returns @xmath43 ; and likewise for bob with registers @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "alice will begin with the qubit @xmath43 initialized to @xmath58 , and bob begins with @xmath44 initialized to @xmath58 as well .",
    "let @xmath59 be a unitary operation , acting on a pair consisting of a qutrit and a qubit , with the following behavior : @xmath60 upon receiving @xmath41 , alice applies @xmath59 to @xmath61 , and bob does likewise to @xmath62 after receiving @xmath42 .",
    "this leaves the 5-tuple @xmath63 in the state @xmath64    alice and bob have not yet sent @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the referee . before sending these registers , they use them as control qubits to transform registers @xmath41 and @xmath42 in superposition : if @xmath43 and @xmath44 are set to @xmath65 then nothing happens , while if @xmath43 and @xmath44 are 1 they perform coherent state exchange , transforming @xmath11 to @xmath53 .",
    "assuming that alice and bob initially share the entangled state @xmath66 the resulting state is @xmath67 for @xmath68    the registers @xmath43 and @xmath44 are now sent to the referee , whose measurement results in outcome 1 with probability @xmath69      now we will prove that alice and bob can not win with certainty regardless of the strategy they employ . without loss of generality",
    ", it may be assumed that alice and bob initially share a pure entangled state @xmath70 , where the spaces @xmath71 and @xmath72 have the same dimension @xmath73 .",
    "when alice and bob receive @xmath41 and @xmath42 from the referee , the state of the entire system is given by @xmath74    general quantum operations performed by alice and bob can be described by linear isometries : @xmath75 for alice and @xmath76 for bob .",
    "these isometries take the form @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 are the spaces associated with the registers @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , and the spaces @xmath80 and @xmath81 are arbitrary .",
    "the state of the system immediately before the referee measures is therefore @xmath82 by defining operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 as @xmath85 we may express the probability that alice and bob win as @xmath86    we have that @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and therefore it is possible to express both @xmath89 and @xmath90 as convex combinations of unitary operators . by convexity , the winning probability",
    "is therefore bounded above by @xmath91 for some choice of unitary operators @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "notice that @xmath94 must have 1 e - bit of entanglement less than @xmath95 , and so the states can not be equal  and therefore the success probability can not be 1 .",
    "a quantitative bound may be proved as follows .",
    "using one of the fuchs ",
    "van de graaf inequalities @xcite and the monotonicity of the fidelity under partial tracing , it holds that @xmath96 for @xmath97 at this point we may follow precisely the analysis of van dam and hayden @xcite for the near - optimality of their universal embezzling families : we have that @xmath98 , from which it follows that @xmath99 by fannes inequality @xcite .",
    "consequently , the winning probability is bounded above by @xmath100 .",

    "an unfortunate fact that follows from the analysis of the game presented above is the following .",

    "we wish to point out one further connection between the above result and some existing work . in the exact catalytic transformation setting of jonathan and plenio @xcite , daftuar and klimesh",
    "@xcite proved the following fact : the dimension of the catalyst required to transform one state to another , when this is possible , can not be bounded by any function of the dimension of those states .",
    "although this fact does not have a direct implication to the cooperative quantum games model , and is incomparable to our result as far as we can see , there is a similarity in spirit between the results that is worthy of note .",
    "kempe , kobayashi , matsumoto , and vidick @xcite proved that multi - prover quantum interactive proof systems can be efficiently transformed to have _ perfect completeness _ , while retaining small soundness error .",

    "we show that the use of coherent state exchange allows the simple proof for the single - prover setting to be applied in the multi - prover setting .",
    "there is , however , one small caveat : whereas kempe , kobayashi , matsumoto , and vidick achieve truly perfect completeness ( in as far as quantum operations can ever be implemented perfectly ) , we must settle for _ near - perfect _ completeness : similar to the game from the previous section , honest provers will be able to convince the verifier to accept yes - inputs with any probability smaller than 1 that they desire , but the probability may not in actuality be 1 . for most intents and purposes ,",
    "though , we believe that this behavior can reasonably be viewed as representing perfect completeness .",
    "suppose that a verifier @xmath115 interacts with @xmath3 provers @xmath4 for @xmath116 rounds , and suppose the completeness and soundness probabilities for this verifier are given by @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively ( which may be functions of the input length ) .",
    "specifically , for the promise problem @xmath119 of interest , the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "the verifier is convinced to accept every yes - input @xmath120 with probability at least @xmath121 by the provers strategy .",
    "2 .   soundness .",
    "the verifier can not be convinced to accept any no - input @xmath122 with probability exceeding @xmath123 , regardless of the provers strategy .    as usual and without loss of generality",
    ", we may `` purify '' a given proof system so that the verifier @xmath115 and provers @xmath4 are described by unitary operations and the provers initial shared entanglement is pure .",
    "we also make two simple assumptions on the proof system and the completeness probability @xmath121 .",
    "first , we assume that it is possible for the provers to convince the verifier to accept every string @xmath120 with probability exactly @xmath121 .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by appending an extra bit to the last message of the first prover and having the verifier reject when this bit is 1 .",
    "second , we assume that the value @xmath121 is such that the verifier can efficiently implement the rotation @xmath124 without error .",
    "( we also assume reversible computations incur no error . )    now , assume that an input string @xmath125 has been fixed .",
    "( as @xmath0 is now fixed , we will not explicitly refer to @xmath0 or @xmath126 when discussing quantities depending on @xmath0 . )",
    "let @xmath127 denote the probability that the verifier accepts .",
    "given the purity assumption of the proof system , this means that the final state of the entire system at the end of the interaction may be expressed as @xmath128 where the first qubit in this expression represents the verifier s output qubit .",
    "the remaining part of the state , represented by @xmath129 and @xmath130 , corresponds to the state of every other register in the proof system , shared in some arbitrary way among the verifier and provers . for simplicity",
    "we will assume that @xmath129 and @xmath130 are orthogonal , which at most requires that the verifier makes a pseudo - copy of the output qubit as its last action .    to transform the proof system to one with near - perfect completeness",
    ", one additional round of communication is added to the end of the protocol . to describe what happens in this additional round of communication ,",
    "let us write @xmath43 to denote the verifier s output qubit , @xmath131 to denote the register comprising all of the verifier s memory aside from the output qubit , and @xmath132 to denote registers representing the provers memories , all corresponding to the final state of the original protocol .    to start the additional round of communication , the verifier prepares @xmath3 additional single - qubit registers @xmath133 as pseudo - copies of @xmath43 , so that the state of the system becomes @xmath134 the verifier then sends @xmath131 to the first prover @xmath135 ( which is an arbitrary choice , but one that all provers are aware of ) , and sends each register @xmath136 to prover @xmath6 .    upon receiving these registers from the verifier , the provers perform the following actions . first ,",
    "using the registers @xmath137 as control qubits , the provers perform coherent state exchange : when each register @xmath136 contains 0 , nothing happens ; and when each register @xmath136 contains  1 , the state @xmath130 is exchanged for @xmath129 .",
    "the resulting state of the entire system is @xmath138 where @xmath139 is an additional shared entangled state the provers use for this purpose , and @xmath140 is defined in the same way as in section  [ sec : exchange ] .",
    "( this expression of @xmath21 makes use of the assumption that @xmath129 and @xmath130 are orthogonal .",
    "one may instead consult the discussion in the appendix , which does not require this assumption . )",
    "the number @xmath20 is the provers choice for an accuracy parameter , which we assume to be as large as they wish . once this is done , the provers return the registers @xmath133 to the verifier .",
    "the final step is that the verifier measures the registers @xmath141 with respect to a basis containing the state @xmath142 , accepting if the output matches this state .",
    "( this is possible given our assumptions on @xmath117 . ) in the case that @xmath120 the provers may take @xmath143 , and so the acceptance probability is @xmath144 this is arbitrarily close to @xmath145 , given that the provers may take any value for @xmath20 . in the case that @xmath122 we have @xmath146 , from which it is routine to show that the acceptance probability is at most @xmath147",
    "we have discussed two applications of coherent state exchange to the study of multi - prover quantum interactive proof systems .",
    "the first application demonstrates that provers in a multi - prover quantum interactive proof system may not always have an optimal strategy when limited to finite entanglement .",
    "we view that the primary importance of this fact is that it will serve to better focus efforts on proving bounds on the amount of entanglement needed for _ close - to - optimal _ provers in multi - prover quantum interactive proofs  for such bounds can only exist in general for close - to - optimal and not optimal success probability .",
    "the second application is a simple proof that multi - prover quantum interactive proof systems can be efficiently transformed to have near - perfect completeness by adding one round of communication .",
