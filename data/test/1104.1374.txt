    "electromagnetic interactions played a key role in the history of physics since they are related to the first successful example of unification of two apparently different fields , the electric and the magnetic one , into a single body , the faraday tensor @xmath0 .",
    "the latter fulfills the so - called maxwell s equations which , on a flat background , are automatically poincar invariant and they yield that @xmath0 can be described in terms of an auxiliary field , the vector potential @xmath1 . even though @xmath0 stays the basic observable of the theory , @xmath1 has the advantage of being apparently easier to handle since every faraday tensor , solution of maxwell s equations , can be reconstructed from a vector potential which solves both the wave equation and a second one , known as the lorenz gauge . with the advent of quantum field theory ,",
    "this interplay between @xmath1 and @xmath0 has been even more emphasized since the quantization scheme which is canonically employed still focuses on the vector potential and considers @xmath0 , also known as the field strength , as a derived object , albeit it is the real observable . in view of the aharonov - bohm effect",
    "this latter assertion might be considered even erroneous since it is often stated that it is actually @xmath1 the true physical object . yet , as noted for example in @xcite , in all idealized and real experiments of the aharonov - bohm kind the true observable is actually the flux of the magnetic field which is present inside an impenetrable region , typically a cylinder .",
    "hence even this quantity can be expressed in terms of the components of the field strength tensor .",
    "the role of the vector potential becomes primary as soon as interactions are switched on , but , till we consider only a free maxwell system , @xmath0 should contain all the physical information both at a classical and at a quantum level .",
    "it is far from the scope of this paper to discuss the details of this procedure , but suffice to say that , on minkowski background and in absence of sources , the result is pretty much satisfactory .",
    "yet the situation starts to complicate itself as soon as it is assumed that the spacetime @xmath2 has a non trivial geometry . although we shall provide more details in the main body of the paper",
    ", we can easily explain the source of all potential problems .",
    "the field strength tensor is best described as a two - form @xmath3 which satisfies maxwell s equations , which in absence of sources can be expressed as @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the exterior derivative while @xmath7 is the codifferential .",
    "it is important to remark that , while the second equation depends on the metric associated to @xmath2 and hence on the geometry , the first one relies only on the smooth differentiable structure of the background and it is thus a constraint .",
    "it is at this stage that the scheme employed on minkowski background encounters the first difficulties since , if we leave @xmath2 arbitrary and thus not a priori diffeomorphic to @xmath8 , we can not apply poincar lemma to conclude the existence of @xmath9 such that @xmath10 . in other words",
    "it is not true that it is always possible to reconstruct all field strengths fulfilling maxwell s equations , even starting from an auxiliary object such as the vector potential @xmath1 . the consequences of this result of differential geometry has far reaching consequences , since it tells us that , if one wants to quantize maxwell s equations on a curved background , unless @xmath2 is somehow special , one can not use @xmath1 as the building block , but has to refer uniquely to @xmath0 .",
    "an example of a field strength which can not be derived from the vector potential can be found in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is indeed to develop a quantization scheme for the field strength on an arbitrary four dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime within the framework of the algebraic formulation of quantum field theory ",
    "see @xcite for an earlier investigation in this language .",
    "this is certainly not the first investigation in this direction and preliminary works are present in @xcite and , as a special case of a much broader analysis , in @xcite .",
    "compared to these earlier publications , we rectify some minor problems mostly in the analysis of the classical dynamical system , but our main contribution will be related to the construction of a field algebra of observables for the field strength . in this endeavour",
    "we will prove in particular that the commutator between two generators of the algebra is given by the lichnerowicz propagator @xcite regardless of the chosen spacetime .",
    "this allows us also to make a direct connection with an old result of ashtekar and sen @xcite , who identified the existence of a two - parameter family of unitary inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations for the field strength on schwarzschild spacetime . in our language",
    "this translates in the existence of a non trivial centre for the field algebra whenever the second de rham cohomology group of the manifold , either with real or with complex coefficients , is non trivial .    as a last point we can address the question whether the field strength tensor can be described as a locally covariant quantum field theory .",
    "first introduced in @xcite , the so - called principle of general local covariance was formulated leading to the realization of a quantum field theory as a covariant functor between the category of globally hyperbolic ( four - dimensional ) lorentzian manifolds with isometric embeddings as morphisms and the category of @xmath11-algebras with injective homomorphisms as morphisms . already shown to hold true for scalars @xcite , spinors @xcite and recently for the proca field and for the vector potential (",
    "though in this case it has been assumed that the first de rham cohomology group of the underlying background is trivial ) @xcite , such paradigm turns out not to hold true in the case of a quantum field theory based on the field strength .",
    "although we will be more explicit in the main body of the paper , we stress that the obstruction is related to a potential clash between the presence of a non trivial centre for the field algebra of @xmath0 in a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath2 and the existence of isometric embeddings of @xmath2 into backgrounds @xmath12 with trivial second de rham cohomology group . as a potential way out",
    ", we show that general local covariance can be restored if the category of admissible spacetimes is suitably reduced , although , as we shall comment later in detail , this has certainly far reaching physical consequences .",
    ".2 cm    the paper will be organized as follows : in section 1.1 we will recollect the notations and conventions we shall use throughout the paper . in section 2",
    "we will instead discuss maxwell s equations and the associated initial value problem , showing that it is well - defined and that the space of solutions can be constructed also in this case with the help of the causal propagator for a suitable second order hyperbolic differential operator .",
    "section 3 will be instead entirely devoted to the issue of constructing the associated field algebra and , in particular , we shall prove that the commutator between two generators can be computed via the lichnerowicz propagator . in section 3.1",
    "we shall show that , whenever certain topological invariants of the background are not trivial , the field algebra possesses a non trivial centre and we fully characterize its elements also providing explicit examples . in section 3.2",
    "we tackle the problem whether the principle of general local covariance holds true for the field strength finding in general a negative answer unless the class of admissible spacetimes is reduced . in section 4",
    "we draw some conclusions .      in this paper",
    ", each background will always be referred to as a _",
    "`` spacetime '' _ , that is a four dimensional differentiable , second countable , hausdorff manifold @xmath2 with a lorentzian metric @xmath13 whose signature is @xmath14 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath2 is _ globally hyperbolic _ , hence there exists a closed achronal subset @xmath15 whose domain of dependence coincides with @xmath2 itself .",
    "note , that a spacetime is usually assumed to be connected in the literature .",
    "yet , in this paper and with respect to the construction of the field algebra in particular , we are also interested in disconnected manifolds with finitely many connected components .",
    "see in particular the remark after proposition [ universal algebra properties ] .",
    "note , that there is no ambiguity in carrying over established results from the connected case to the disconnected case with finitely many connected components . on account of standard results in differential geometry and of the recent analysis in @xcite and of theorem 1.1 in @xcite",
    ", global hyperbolicity entails that there exists an isometry @xmath16 between @xmath2 and a smooth product manifold @xmath17 .",
    "thus @xmath18 turns out to be a three - dimensional embedded submanifold and theorem 2.1 in @xcite guarantees , moreover , that @xmath19 splits as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a temporal function , @xmath22 while @xmath23 induces for fixed values of @xmath24 a smooth riemannian metric on @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore global hyperbolicity yields that @xmath2 admits an orientation and thus , henceforth , we assume that a choice has been done and all spacetimes are globally hyperbolic as well as time oriented and oriented .",
    "on top of the geometric structure we shall consider @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively the set of smooth and of smooth and compactly supported @xmath27-forms on @xmath2 with values in the field @xmath28 , usually chosen either as @xmath29 or @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 , where the parenthesis around the subscript indicates that the statement holds true both with and without the subscript itself .",
    "let @xmath28 be the complex numbers ; then , on these spaces , one can define two natural operators , the external derivative @xmath33 and the hodge dual @xmath34 .",
    "notice that , while @xmath6 is completely independent from @xmath13 , @xmath35 is instead a function of the underlying metric .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath35 is invertible , we can introduce a third operator , known as the codifferential @xmath36 .    in the main body of the paper",
    "we will be often interested in compactly supported smooth forms which are either closed or coclosed and to avoid to be redundant in the exposition we introduce the following novel notation : @xmath37 to conclude , we mention two further ingredients we shall need in the forthcoming discussion . the first is @xmath38 which is the @xmath27-th de rham cohomology group of @xmath2 ",
    "see @xcite for the definition and for a recollection of the main properties .",
    "it is noteworthy that , since such groups are built only out of the external derivative , they are completely independent from the underlying geometry and from @xmath13 in particular .",
    "we can combine together @xmath6 and @xmath7 to define the laplace - de rham operator @xmath39 .",
    "the second ingredient is instead @xmath40 which stands for the @xmath27-th smooth singular homology group of the manifold and whose main properties are discussed in @xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the main objective of this paper is to shed some light on the classical and on the quantum structure of maxwell s equations on curved backgrounds , emphasizing in particular how the underlying topology affects the qualitative behaviour of the system . to start with",
    ", we need to introduce the key objects of our analysis : the curved spacetime analogue of maxwell s equations sees @xmath3 as the dynamical variable and the dynamics is ruled by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the external current such that @xmath43 .",
    "a key property of when defined on a generic spacetime @xmath44 lies in the analysis of the first identity .",
    "this is a constraint on the form of @xmath0 which usually leads to state both that there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath10 and that one can consider @xmath1 , the so - called vector potential as the underlying dynamical field .",
    "this statement is based on the poincar lemma which , alas , can not be always applied since it fails to hold true whenever @xmath45 is not trivial . in this particular case , it turns out that there exist classical field strengths which can not be derived as the external derivative of a suitable one - form . since , from a physical point of view , it is @xmath0 the observable field of the dynamical system , it is natural to wonder whether a full classical and quantum analysis of could be performed without making use of any auxiliary structure such as the vector potential .    in order to grasp the classical behaviour of a dynamical system ruled by , we need to prove that this set of equations admits a well - defined initial value problem on every globally hyperbolic spacetime . despite the apparent obviousness of this question , to the best of our knowledge",
    "it turns out that this problem has been only partly treated in details and the discussions available in the literature are either partly incomplete or based upon further restrictive assumptions , such as the compactness of the cauchy surface @xmath18 ",
    "see @xcite , but also @xcite although they work with the vector potential . on the opposite , since we want to cope with the most general scenario , we need the following statement  see also @xcite for a similar analysis :    [ cauchy problem field strength tensor ] let @xmath46 be an oriented 4-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime with at most finitely many connected components whose smooth spacelike cauchy surface is @xmath18 with smooth embedding @xmath47 .",
    "then , for each triple @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , there exists a unique solution @xmath53 of the initial value problem as @xmath54 in place of @xmath55 .",

    "@xmath57 furthermore , @xmath0 depends linearly and continuously on both the source term @xmath58 , and on the initial data @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "each solution also enjoys the following support property : @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the causal future and past of @xmath63 respectively .",
    "we start with the connected case . since @xmath64",
    ", one can realize by direct inspection that every solution of also solves @xmath65 . yet , in order to use the latter as a starting point to solve maxwell s equations , we need to prove that we can always select suitable initial data for the wave equation so that a solution of the latter yields also one of . to this avail , let us consider @xmath66 where @xmath54 here is the pull - back induced from @xmath47 on the compactly supported sections of the exterior bundle on @xmath2 . in other words",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are maps from @xmath18 into @xmath69 such that @xmath70 on account of @xmath2 being isometric to @xmath17 with line element @xmath71 as outlined in section [ notations ] , here @xmath72 is a coordinate patch of @xmath2 adapted to this last metric .",
    "it intersects @xmath18 on a non empty open set and it is endowed with a local chart @xmath73 , whereas @xmath74 is the unit normal vector to @xmath18 .",

    "this translates in the failure of the homomorphism from @xmath157 into @xmath444 from being injective and thus the embedding translates in a loss of a qualitative feature of the field algebra of @xmath2 when seen from @xmath12 , such as the presence of superselection sectors as first discussed in @xcite .",
    "as we have proven in the previous section , a potential way out is to restrict the class of spacetimes we consider and general local covariance is restored as soon as we assume to work only with backgrounds with vanishing second de rham cohomology group . yet",
    "it is fair to admit that the situation is rather puzzling : on the one hand the proposed solution would discard spacetimes , such as schwarzschild , which are certainly of physical relevance , while on the other hand the requirement that @xmath388 vanishes entails that all field strength tensors would descend from a vector potential .",
    "this feature is certainly desirable as soon as we want to move from a free field theory to an interacting one such as quantum electrodynamics where the spinor fields are known to interact via @xmath9 rather than via the faraday tensor .",
    "yet we feel it is still early to claim we have a total loss : as a matter of fact , if we focus on any equivalence class @xmath401\\in h^2(m)$ ] , we are considering all elements of the form @xmath462 where @xmath9 while @xmath3 .",
    "in other words each non trivial cohomology class is composed of two parts .",
    "the first , is responsible for qualitative features such as global topological charges or , from the quantum perspective , for the identification of a specific superselection section and , hence , it is strictly tied to the specific chosen spacetime .",
    "the second is instead tied to a @xmath333-form , a sort of vector potential , and it is well - suited both to discuss interactions and to apply the principle of general local covariance . although we are aware that this is simply a remark which does not necessarily solve all problems we have at hand , we still feel it is a starting point for further investigations which is worth to consider in detail .",
