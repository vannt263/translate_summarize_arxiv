    "during the past decades , the financial markets around the world have become more and more interconnected .",
    "the financial globalization has changed the organization structure of the stock markets by creating new risks and challenges for market participants .",
    "dramatic expansion of the cross - border financial flows as well as domestic flows within the countries due to very rapid increase of telecommunication and computer - based products have emerged . as a consequence , the world financial markets are increasingly efficient today than ever before .",
    "the integration and globalization process opens discussion about the activity of the central economic institutions that focus attention to financial market monitoring .",
    "the subsequent regulatory legislative yields asymptotically to dynamic balance between coalitions based on agreements of the cooperating companies and on the other hand competitors that enhance a diversity of the price trends .",
    "the _ feedback _ signals of different reliability are monitored and daily evaluated by central economic institutions .",
    "consequently , this affects correlated decisions of the market participants .",
    "an expected effect of the global self - regulation is a portfolio efficiency .",
    "recently , there have been many attempts to gain a control over the dynamics of complex systems .",
    "the approaches based on the principles of feedback and adaptivity emerges as a perspective branch  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the positive feedback mechanism in the economic context has been studied in ref .",
    "an approach based on the feedback control of spatially extended optical system has been employed in the ref .",
    "the feedback mechanism is also exploited in monte carlo  ( mc ) algorithm introduced by us recently in ref .",
    "the algorithm is formulated as a random walk of temperature variable biased by feedback that mixes current and past stochastic signals , originating at the platform of extended statistical system . the time integrated signals are used to build up the actions shifting an instant temperature towards the critical temperature value . due to limited memory depth",
    ", the convergence process is necessarily accompanied by uncertainty .",
    "since the feedback treats a partial information only , many parallels with risky decisions within the business world can be found .",
    "therefore , the mc feedback model may be used for simulation of decision - making in the stochastic environment .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "the self - adjusted mc algorithm is reintroduced briefly .",
    "its relationship to non - equilibrium spin updates is discussed in  sec .",
    "[ sca1 ] . the  sec .",
    "[ socrel1 ] deals with the statistics of spin clusters near the critical conditions and the self - adjusted algorithm is related to cellular automaton models of self - organized criticality  ( soc ) . in  sec .",
    "[ eco11 ] , the applications of mentioned mc dynamics to models of financial markets is presented .",
    "before proceeding to the introduction of financial model , we recall the salient points of the self - adjusted mc model  @xcite that is based on the random walk of the temperature variable @xmath1 defined by the one - step recurrence @xmath2 where @xmath3 parameterizes a maximum step length @xmath4 , randomized by @xmath5 that is uniformly distributed within the @xmath6 range .",
    "the subscript @xmath7 accounts for mc steps per @xmath8 degrees of freedom .",
    "feedback regulatory response _ @xmath9 mixes an influence of bias and randomness involved in the energy series @xmath10 that represents outcome of some extended statistical system .",
    "eq.([dcdt1 ] ) approximates a temperature derivative of the specific heat @xmath11 $ ] at the canonical equilibrium  ( eq ) ensemble defined by the constant temperature @xmath12 @xcite . in eq.([dcdt1 ] ) the canonical averages are approximated by instantaneous running averages of the energy cumulants @xmath13 , @xmath14 calculated with the assistance of linear filter  @xcite as it follows @xmath15 here the plasticity parameter @xmath16 reweights an energy samples @xmath17 according to delay . for @xmath18 , running averages vary slowly and long - memory processes dominates , whereas in the limit @xmath19 the memorizing becomes faster but less efficient .    the feedback is applied to maintain the critical regime of the 2d  ising spin micromodel of ferromagnet .",
    "this is defined for @xmath20 sites of @xmath21 square lattice characterized by the exchange energy @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where exchange coupling constant rescales an instant temperature @xmath1 . the nearest neighbor  ( nn ) interaction is considered .",
    "this interaction picture is supplemented by the periodic boundary conditions in all directions . the standard metropolis single - spin - flip algorithm  @xcite where two states are linked by the flip acceptance probability @xmath24 depends on the energy change @xmath25 at @xmath26th site .",
    "the technical issue of the proposed implementation is that @xmath1 is hold constant during @xmath27 spin updates  ( i.e.  1 mc step per sample ) .",
    "the example which illustrates @xmath1 dynamics is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . as follows from eq.([eqppp1 ] ) , a filtered information serves to provide @xmath28 near criticality . in compliance with a previous facts , the _ feedback role _ in dynamics",
    "can be summarized as follows : a )  it _ receives _ series of energy @xmath10 values from extended statistical system ( or only sufficient part of the series is served for this purpose ) ; b )  it _ treats _ the series via the linear _ filtering _ that generates _ running averages _ @xmath29 ; c )  it transmits the _ regulatory signals _ @xmath30 via the temperature given by eq.([ttttt1 ] ) .",
    "after the transient time the thermal noise overcomes a regular bias involved in stochastic @xmath31 and system with feedback maintain a stationary regime .",
    "due to fluctuations of @xmath1 a non - equilibrium distribution is generated .",
    "therefore , the expectation mean values , worth our interest are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 . if the number of excluded steps @xmath34 is larger than the transient time , the average @xmath35 estimates critical point of the extended system .",
    "thus , the observation time is defined by @xmath36 . in our simulations we used @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "there are many examples of the simple non - equilibrium spin - flip stochastic models  @xcite giving rise to the various dynamical phases . to simulate nearly equilibrium systems ,",
    "the specific non - equilibrium approaches have been suggested .",
    "for instance , the ref .",
    "@xcite exploits the controlled growth of percolating spin cluster .",
    "the postulation of artificial dynamics clearly places novel time scales into original equilibrium problem . in our case",
    "the combination of two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath3 affect the distance between a stationary non - equilibrium statistics and canonical equilibrium .",
    "the basic properties of stationary non - equilibrium regime can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the stationary regime with a ferro - paramagnetic order and positive @xmath35 is stabilized by a sufficiently slow dynamics limited to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a threshold value .",
    "the irreversible drop to negative @xmath39  ( antiferromagnetic order ) occurs at @xmath43 .    similar transition can be found for the coupled map lattice where antiferromagnetic order is generated spontaneously by ferromagnetic couplings accompanied by sufficiently fast synchronous dynamics  @xcite . for @xmath44 , @xmath45",
    "we estimated @xmath46 .",
    "the canonical equilibrium limit @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the pseudocritical temperature of specific heat , is reached for the sufficiently slow dynamics @xmath49 , when the feedback memory is deep ( @xmath50 ) and parameters admit the scale separation @xmath51 . in addition , the stationary averages have to be accumulated for @xmath52 .    \\3 . for stationary regime",
    "( see point 1 ) the nonzero variance @xmath53 gives rise to the broad energy distribution in comparison to boltzmann one .",
    "the question of practical relevance is whether true @xmath54 can be attained by non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the result of simulation realized for @xmath55 , @xmath56 is depicted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the standard finite - size dependence of @xmath57  @xcite ( where @xmath58 denotes the thermal coefficient ) has been obtained from the fit . without additional",
    "tuning the simulation provides estimate @xmath59 of the equilibrium exact value @xmath60^{-1 }   \\simeq 0.56729 $ ]  @xcite .    as one can see in fig.[fig3]a",
    "follows that substantial finite - size corrections occur for a short - time memory . in that case , the temperature mean value can be interpolated by @xmath61 where cut - off @xmath62 is roughly interpolatated by @xmath63 with @xmath64 . from the fit carried out within the range @xmath65",
    "we have determined the exponent @xmath66 .",
    "assuming that the lowest mean value @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is achieved , for @xmath69 we may write @xmath70 . the presence of the temperature lower bound is associated with the condition that peak of specific heat is formed .",
    "this implies the requirement of a residual acceptance of single - spin - flips at very low temperatures .",
    "the bound can be explained in the frame of two - level specific heat model denoted as @xmath71 .",
    "the model takes into account only single branch of ground state @xmath72  ( since the ergodicity is broken , the ground state is counted once ) and @xmath73-fold single - spin excitation of energy  @xmath74 . the condition for extreme @xmath75 yields equation @xmath76 .",
    "the last relation predicts a monotonous decrease of @xmath77 with @xmath78 and solution can be simply approximated by @xmath79 for infinite @xmath78 asymptotics . to estimate @xmath77",
    "we have carried out simulation for @xmath80 and @xmath81 that gives @xmath35 from @xmath82 range .",
    "the mean value @xmath35 is approximated by @xmath83 .",
    "the assumption about the energy gap corresponding to two lowest levels is consistent with the presence of the crossing over memory depth @xmath84  ( two mc steps ) . to maintain a stationary regime the substantial memory reduction for @xmath85 have to be compensated by the enlarged @xmath39 value .",
    "we observed that for @xmath86 the ergodic time @xmath87 between the plus and minus magnetization stages diverges as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the dynamical exponent  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath90 is smaller than @xmath87 , the broken symmetry can be detected .",
    "clearly , for @xmath85 the `` jaggy '' @xmath91 dependence indicates the occupancy of only few lowest energy levels .",
    "the concept of soc proposed by bak  @xcite represents the unifying theoretical framework of systems that drive themselves spontaneously to critical regime . the sand pile ,",
    "forest - fire  @xcite and game - of - life @xcite are well - known examples of cellular automaton soc models .",
    "their stationary regime can be characterized by invariant _ probability distribution functions _",
    "( pdf s ) of spatial or temporal measures of the dissipative events called  _ avalanches_. the corresponding pdf s include a power - law intervals with the specific non - equilibrium critical exponents .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the stationary soc regime implies the operation of inherent feedback mechanism . on the contrary ,",
    "our model has explicitely defined global feedback coupled to the mc dynamics .",
    "such coupling is completely different from the standard models of soc , but the arguments given in this section suggest that additional coupling anchors statistical properties indistinguishable from soc models .    in the next , we focus our attention to the problem of _ partial information regulation _ to answer the question , how important can be a concrete feedback form .",
    "we consider spatially truncated form of feedback defined by energy cumulants calculated for the rectangular @xmath92 \\times l$ ] lattice segment , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 $ ] denotes an integer value of @xmath95 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig.[fig3]b for @xmath96 .",
    "the simulation has confirmed that stationary regime is robust with respect to the _ partial information regulation _ represented by @xmath40 and @xmath97 terms .",
    "as one can be see in fig.[fig3 ] , both sufficiently small @xmath40 , ( @xmath98 , and @xmath97 have similar influence on diminishing the stationary @xmath39 value .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pdf s of spin clusters at a second - order critical point resembles pdf s of the spatial extent of avalanches .",
    "admittedly , the correspondence between spins and clusters is not unique and thus numerous mapping schemes could be examined .",
    "we have utilized the well - known mapping to bond percolation model  @xcite via wolf s algorithm  @xcite to identify cluster without overturning . to interpret the cluster statistics",
    ", we suggest the universal scaling in the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the number of spins belonging to the same cluster . in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "are depicted spin cluster pdf s .",
    "as one can see , the distribution functions for clusters @xmath101 clearly obey the scaling given by eq.[scaclus1 ] , where @xmath102 is proportional to the size of a spanning cluster .",
    "it is associated with the peak @xmath103 in @xmath104 distribution . using the scaling relation @xmath105 , the fractal dimension",
    "@xmath106 has been determined from the fit , see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a . assuming an asymptotic form @xmath107 in the limit @xmath108 we obtained @xmath109 that implies independence on @xmath78 if @xmath110 .",
    "surprisingly , the dependencies in fig.[fig4]b indicate that small - scale power - law scenario survives for full @xmath16 range .",
    "it does nt matter how distant an assembly is from the thermal equilibrium except a spanning cluster that grows with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "since the static bond percolation model pays no attention to temporal variations , the alternative maps should be examined , for instance those taking into account a short - time memory of cluster evolution  @xcite . the question whether differences in a spin - cluster map definition might affect a non - equilibrium exponent @xmath111 , introduced in eq.[scaclus1 ] ,",
    "is left for future research .",
    "performed simulations for pdf of @xmath31 defined as @xmath112 confirm that flat tails exhibit within the full range of @xmath40 , see fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "therefore , it is worth to check _ functional stability _ of aggregated regulatory responses @xmath113 the results of analysis depicted in fig.[fig5]b has validated the expected scaling @xmath114 for @xmath115 with estimated exponent @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is some universal function . since @xmath31 is bounded , the crossing - over from lvy to gaussian",
    "scaling has been verified , see fig.[fig5]b .",
    "more profound connection to the price dynamics is discussed in the following section .",
    "the dynamics of self - adjusted system can be analyzed by means of autocorrelation functions of the time lag @xmath7 : @xmath118 the mc model yields nearly exponential decrease of @xmath119 , see fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the power - law dependence of @xmath120 which becomes more pronounced for larger @xmath78 is identified . assuming the form @xmath121 we have determined @xmath122 .      on the basis of previous facts",
    "we have proposed model based on the two postulates : ( i )  under the conditions of new economy the world market entities ( participants , companies ) are forced to evolve towards the longer auto - correlation times .",
    "it means that hardly predicable - volatile price statistics gets stuck in the regime which imply highest degree of uncertainty .",
    "it might be classified as an  _ edge of the chaos_. such interpretation is fundamentally equivalent with the dynamics of the continuous phase transitions and dynamics of information processing  @xcite ; ( ii )  the centralized institutions are established to satisfy the global information and legislative needs of market entities looking for the arbitrage opportunities . the action of participants leads to enhancement of market effectiveness in the sense of the postulate  ( i ) .",
    "our simulation have shown that presented spin model that involves feedback has much in common with ising spin market models of the price dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the feedback introduced in bornholdt s model  @xcite , which was later elucidated by kaizoji , bornholdt and fujiwara ( bkf ) , is linked to the local in time and global in lattice space magnetization @xmath123 .",
    "both models are inspired by the paradigm of minority game  @xcite .",
    "speaking in game theory term , the feedback promotes the continuing tournaments between competing ordered  ( ferro ) and disordered  ( para ) magnetic phases . to maintain a balance between ordered ferromagnetic and disordered - paramagnetic spin phase ,",
    "the feedback mechanism including a global cooling or heating is applied .",
    "the predicted temperature is simultaneously transmitted to all lattice sites .",
    "clearly , the effect of such step has probabilistic nature , because a freedom exists between the market entities which can uphold or abolish older or establish new coalitions , respectively .",
    "subsequently , any decision is reflected by correlations between entities .",
    "two principal situations may be observed from the view point of the proposed model . at the subcritical temperatures the clusters grow , which means that correlations among market entities become increase .",
    "a subcritical temperature can increase a mean cluster size until a spanning cluster come into existence .",
    "the ferromagnetic domain state can be understood as a market situation where competition is distorted due to monopoly , duopoly or trust formation effects . to prevent from highly correlated stocks",
    ", the feedback triggers the antitrust operations  @xcite .",
    "the portfolio diversification is represented by the fragmentation of the spin clusters .",
    "the spin model presented in previous sections displays several interesting statistical properties that are particularly relevant for stochastic financial market dynamics .",
    "one of our challenges is to examine cross - links between our feedback model and bkf model . in bkf model the local spin behavior",
    "is given by the competition between the local and non - local interactions involved in local field @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is proportionality factor of feedback instant magnetization .",
    "the probability of @xmath126 lattice spin states is given by @xmath127 $ ] , where @xmath128 is the inverse constant temperature .",
    "the difference @xmath129 is interpreted as a logarithm of the price return . within the bkf model",
    "the instant price is proportional to @xmath130 term , where @xmath131 is related to the ratio of the interacting and fundamental traders .    in",
    "further we assume the equivalence of @xmath132 and @xmath133 terms considered for different models .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath133 as a price term is in accord with requirement that price increases when the competition is weakened .",
    "the crucial items emphasizing the common aspects of models are listed in table  [ tabbb1 ] and illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and  [ fig8 ] .",
    "we see that both models yield lvy distributions with the nearly common index @xmath134 related to cumulative distributions with power law slope @xmath135 that is consistent with the empirical data  @xcite .",
    "the bowl - shaped anomaly at small @xmath136 is probably due to @xmath30 sharpness .",
    "the remarkable feature of this comparison is a similarity of the exponents obtained for pdf s of the bull ( bear ) market durations .",
    "in addition , the similarity of temporal aspects can be seen in coincidence of stationary conditional probabilities of bull - bear switching listed in the table  [ tabbb1 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath31 feedback model acquires the exponential form typical for the positively correlated quantities , whereas the magnetization variations predicted by bkf are anticorrelated .",
    "clearly , this difference can be explained providing energy cumulants temporal filtering .",
    "the simulation of bkf model reveals some gap between hurst exponents  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the standard diffusive  @xmath137 behaviour which is typical for @xmath138 , the superdiffusive short - time regime @xmath139 has been identified for @xmath31 feedback model .    .",
    "the comparison of the statistical characteristics of models of financial market for @xmath80 . the simulation results obtained for parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the bkf parameters @xmath142 , @xmath143 are chosen to attain the intermittent regime .",
    "the positive @xmath31 ( also @xmath144 ) is the signature of so called bull market regime , while @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) is interpreted as a bear market regime . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the subsection certain diverse application of our model is presented .",
    "as one sees , the mc model may be used to understand the basic features of the mechanism of regulation of bilateral stock cross - correlations .",
    "the role of central institutions , modeled via the feedback , is to perform large - scale eligible decisions that could enhance portfolio efficiency .",
    "these contribute to @xmath31 comprising a summary of the stock prices .",
    "we assume that different stocks are distinguished by lattice position and sign of dominant trend at given time . and for now the correspondence between spins and stocks follows a simple majority rule : @xmath147  ( @xmath148 when the _ sell _  ( buy ) market _ orders _ prevail during elementary time lag  ( 1  mc step / site ) , respectively .",
    "the cross - correlations among directly regulated - four `` nearest '' stocks are related to the mean exchange energy term @xmath149 optimized by @xmath31 to be extremely susceptible to regulation .",
    "the long - range cross - correlations stem from indirect regulation of the portfolio composition near to criticality .",
    "the presence of correlations  ( and anticorrelations ) between pairs of stocks play a key role in the theory of selecting of the most efficient portfolio composition of the financial goods  @xcite . for discussed spin model the properties of the pairs of stocks",
    "can be characterized by the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath150 ranging from @xmath151 to @xmath152 . here",
    "@xmath153 denote the pair of randomly chosen sites .",
    "in the simulations the temporal averages have been calculated for  @xmath154 steps and accumulated in pdf s depicted in  fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "we see that the pair correlations are dominantly positive except a negative tail that agrees qualitatively with the empirical studies  @xcite . for @xmath40 larger than @xmath155 the negative tail vanishes and pdf of @xmath156",
    "is shifted towards @xmath152 .",
    "clearly , such `` coherent '' regime is typical for inefficient portfolio structure .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented application of adaptivity concept to critical phenomena . despite of the principal difficulties , insufficient understanding of the systematic errors which arise proceeding from non - equilibrium to equilibrium",
    ", we expect that work might inspire numerous applications to other inverse statistical problems where constrains are written in terms of running averages .",
    "we have demonstrated that mc model can be reinterpreted in macro - economic terms .",
    "the simulations indicated spontaneous emergence of the power - law distribution for feedback regulatory signals which is universal feature of the stationary non - equilibrium regime .",
    "surprisingly , we found that @xmath157 statistics contradicts to our previous expectations based on the finding @xmath158 , which does not imply power - law fall - off of the autocorrelations of @xmath136 .",
    "the influence of the memory depth related to parameter @xmath40 has also been investigated extensively .",
    "the critical point related to the most efficient portfolio structure , is an abstract of ideal situation when @xmath159 , which is unattainable in a real finite - memory conditions .",
    "otherwise , we have found that the portfolio efficiency is weakened via short - time memory for @xmath160 .",
    "the comparative study of two spin models have confirmed that presented mc dynamics based on the specific heat feedback offers an alternative description of financial markets . despite of outstanding similarities , the comparison of exponents indicate non - trivial relationship between the universality classes of studied models .",
