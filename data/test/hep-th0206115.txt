    "the basic premise of string phenomenology is to explore the constructions and the particle physics implications of four - dimensional string solutions with phenomenologically viable features ( _ i.e. _ , solutions which give rise to an effective theory containing the standard model ) .",
    "the moduli space of different compactifications of string theory is highly degenerate at the perturbative level , and so we are faced with the poorly understood question of how the string vacuum describing the observable world is selected .",
    "nevertheless , by exploring models with quasi - realistic features from various corners of m theory , one may deduce some generic physical implications of string derived models .",
    "prior to the second string revolution , the focus of string phenomenology was on the construction of such solutions within the framework of the weakly coupled heterotic string . over the years",
    ", many semi - realistic models have been constructed in this framework , and the resulting phenomenology has been subsequently analysed @xcite . the richness of semi - realistic heterotic string models is also in sharp contrast to the apparent no - go theorem in other formulations of string theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , the techniques of conformal field theory in describing d - branes and orientifold planes allow for the construction of quasi - realistic string models in another calculable regime of m theory , as illustrated by the various four - dimensional @xmath2 supersymmetric type ii orientifolds@xcite . in these models ,",
    "chiral fermions appear on the worldvolume of the d - branes since they are located at orbifold singularities in the internal space .",
    "another promising direction to obtain chiral fermions , which has only recently been exploited in model building , is to consider branes at angles .",
    "the spectrum of open strings stretched between branes at angles may contain chiral fermions which are localized at the intersection of branes @xcite .",
    "this fact ( or its t - dual version , i.e. , branes with flux ) was employed in @xcite in constructing semi - realistic brane world models .",
    "however , the semi - realistic models considered in this context are typically non - supersymmetric , and the stability of non - supersymmetric models ( and the dynamics involved in restabilization ) is not fully understood .",
    "this was one of the motivations of @xcite in constructing chiral supersymmetric orientifold models with branes at angles .",
    "the constraints on supersymmetric four - dimensional models are rather restrictive . despite the remarkable progress in developing techniques of orientifold constructions ,",
    "there is only one orientifold model @xcite that has been constructed so far with the ingredients of the mssm : @xmath3 supersymmetry , the standard model gauge group as a part of the gauge structure , and candidate fields for the three generations of quarks and leptons as well as the electroweak higgs doublets .",
    "the general class of supersymmetric orientifold models considered in @xcite corresponds ( in the strong coupling limit ) to m theory compactification on purely geometrical backgrounds admitting a @xmath1 metric , providing the first explicit realization of m theory compactification on compact @xmath1 holonomy spaces that yields non - abelian gauge groups and chiral fermions as well as other quasi - realistic features of the standard and gut models .",
    "this work also sheds light on the recent results of obtaining four - dimensional chiral fermions from @xmath1 compactifications of m theory @xcite , as further elaborated in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we further explore the basic properties of the models , in particular the three - family standard - like model in @xcite .",
    "the construction , the chiral spectrum and some of the basic features of the model were described in the original work @xcite .",
    "the details of the chiral and non - chiral spectra , the explicit evaluation of the gauge couplings , the properties of the two extra @xmath4 symmetries , and further phenomenological implications associated with charge confinement in the strongly coupled quasi - hidden sector were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the model is not fully realistic .",
    "in addition to the standard model group , there are two additional @xmath4 symmetries , one of which has family non - universal and therefore flavor changing couplings , and a quasi - hidden non - abelian sector which becomes strongly coupled above the electroweak scale .",
    "the perturbative spectrum contains a fourth family of exotic ( @xmath5- singlet ) quarks and leptons , in which , however , the left - chiral states have unphysical electric charges . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that these could decouple from the low energy spectrum due to hidden sector charge confinement , and that anomaly matching requires the physical left - chiral states to be composites .",
    "the model has multiple higgs doublets and additional exotic states .",
    "the low energy predictions for the gauge couplings depend on the choice moduli parameters .",
    "the study in @xcite reveals that @xmath6 can be fitted to the experimental value , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are off by about a factor of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to carry out further the analysis of the couplings in the model . in particular , we focus on the calculation of yukawa couplings and study their physical implications .",
    "the yukawa couplings among chiral matter are due to the world - sheet instanton contributions associated with the action of string world - sheet stretching among intersections where the corresponding chiral matter fields are located .",
    "the leading contribution to the yukawa couplings is therefore proportional to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the smallest area of the string world - sheet stretching among the brane intersection points .",
    "the complete calculation of the yukawa couplings involves techniques of calculating correlation functions involving twisted fields in the conformal field theory of open strings .",
    "the origin of the yukawa couplings , i.e. , their world - sheet instanton origin and the consequences of the exponential hierarchies within interesecting brane constructions , was first discussed and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "( for related applications to the fermion mass hierarchy within gut intersecting brane constructions , see @xcite . )",
    "the purpose of our work is to systematically evaluate the leading order contributions to the yukawa couplings for the supersymmetric three family standard - like model . even though we will approach the study only in the leading order of world - sheet instanton contributions",
    ", we shall elucidate these features explicitly and discuss the consequences of the resulting hierarchies of the yukawa couplings .",
    "the method can also be further applied to other constructions involving intersecting branes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the features of the model and the chiral spectrum . in section 3",
    "we focus on the calculation of the yukawa couplings both in the quark and lepton sectors of the model . in section 4",
    "we discuss some physical implications of the hierarchical structure of these couplings and other possible low energy implications .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the model is an orientifold of type iia on @xmath13 .",
    "the orbifold actions have generators @xmath14 , @xmath15 acting as @xmath16 , and @xmath17 on the complex coordinates @xmath18 of @xmath19 , which is assumed to be factorizable .",
    "the orientifold action is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is world - sheet parity , and @xmath22 acts by @xmath23 .",
    "the model contains four kinds of o6-planes , associated with the actions of @xmath20 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the cancellation of the rr crosscap tadpoles requires an introduction of @xmath27 stacks of @xmath28 d6-branes ( @xmath29 ) wrapped on three - cycles ( taken to be the product of 1-cycles @xmath30 in the @xmath31 two - torus ) , and their images under @xmath20 , wrapped on cycles @xmath32 . in the case where d6-branes are chosen parallel to the o6-planes , the resulting model is related by t - duality to the orientifold in @xcite , and is non - chiral .",
    "chirality is however achieved using d6-branes at non - trivial angles .",
    "the cancellation of untwisted tadpoles imposes constraints on the number of d6-branes and the types of 3-cycles that they wrap around .",
    "the cancellation of twisted tadpoles determines the orbifold actions on the chan - paton indices of the branes ( the explicit form of the orbifold actions are given in @xcite ) .",
    "the condition that the system of branes preserves @xmath3 supersymmetry requires @xcite that each stack of d6-branes is related to the o6-planes by a rotation in @xmath33 : denoting by @xmath34 the angles the d6-brane forms with the horizontal direction in the @xmath31 two - torus , supersymmetry preserving configurations must satisfy @xmath35 .",
    "this in turn imposes a constraint on the wrapping numbers and the complex structure moduli @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the respective sizes of the @xmath38-th two - torus .",
    "an example leading to a three - family standard - like model massless spectrum corresponds to the following case .",
    "the d6-brane configuration is provided in table [ cycles3family ] , and satisfies the tadpole cancellation conditions .",

    "the basic results for the yukawa couplings are given in equations ( [ yukawa ] ) , ( [ area0 ] ) , ( [ arealep ] ) , and ( [ areaup ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to discuss the implications for the fermion masses without a detailed knowledge of the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , which in turn depend on the details of the soft supersymmetry breaking , the effective @xmath41 terms for the higgs fields , and the normalization factors of the kinetic energy terms , which have not been determined .",
    "as was discussed in  @xcite , the large number of higgs doublets and the lack of a compelling mechanism to generate effective @xmath41 terms , at least at the perturbative level , are significant drawbacks of the construction .",
    "also , the construction contains a strongly coupled quasi - hidden section , which is a candidate for dynamical supersymmetry breaking , and the detailed study of these phenomena is in progress @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can make a few general comments about the implications of the yukawa couplings , emphasizing the simplest case in which the d6 branes are positioned very close to the symmetric positions in the six - torus , as in  ( [ area0 ] ) . in this case",
    ", there are only four independent yukawa couplings , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ yukawasection ] there are theoretical uncertainties concerning the prefactors and numerical factors in the exponents .",
    "for definiteness , we will assume that @xmath44 is a good approximation at least for the ratios of yukawa couplings .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath45 .",
    "in that case , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , with all but @xmath50 being extremely small for @xmath51 much larger than the minimum value of @xmath52 .",
    "intermediate values for the @xmath51 will yield nontrivial hierarchies for the yukawas .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite ( [ yukawa ] ) as @xmath53 \\bar{u}_k   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & q_l^{ii } \\sum_{k=1}^4 \\left [ h_{1,ii } h^1_{uk } + \\sqrt{2 } h_{2,ii } \\left ( \\frac{h^2_{uk } + h^3_{uk}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\right ) \\right ] \\bar{u}_k , \\label{yukawa2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath27 represents the four terms ( @xmath54 , and the primed terms ) in  ( [ yukawa ] ) .",
    "when some of the higgs fields acquire vevs this will yield a @xmath55 mass matrix for the two @xmath56 quarks and four antiquarks .",
    "however , in the special case that the two rows are proportional ( i.e. , that they are aligned in the @xmath27 direction ) , there will only be a single nonzero mass eigenvalue .",
    "let us first consider the case of large sizes , so that all of the couplings are small except @xmath50 .",
    "then , there will only be one significant mass term , corresponding to @xmath57 and a linear combination of the @xmath58 , with coefficients depending on the vevs of the @xmath59 .",
    "the other mass eigenvalue will be exponentially small .",
    "in the special case of radiative symmetry breaking , usually associated with supergravity mediated supersymmetry breaking but also occurring for gauge mediation , the second mass would be exactly zero .",
    "that is because only the @xmath59 s have the large yukawa couplings needed to drive their ( presumably positive ) mass - squares at the string scale to negative values at low energies , and the vevs of the other higgs doublets would vanish .",
    "( the small @xmath43 would lead to a tiny mixing between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , but not generate a second non - zero mass because the two terms would be aligned in @xmath27 . ) on the other hand , for small @xmath62 both @xmath50 and @xmath63 ( the yukawa coupling for the relevant state @xmath64 ) , could be significant , leading to two non - zero mass eigenstates provided that the terms are not aligned in @xmath27 . for radiative",
    "breaking , the two large yukawas could drive both relevant mass - squares negative , and alignment would not be expected except for very specific values for the mass - squares at the string scale and the effective @xmath41 parameters and kinetic terms . in this case , the hierarchy @xmath65 , @xmath66 could be achieved by a hierarchy in the vevs of the @xmath59 s relative to the @xmath64 ) , which could be achieved by modest differences in the relevant soft supersymmetry breaking and other terms .    thus , it is possible to achieve a hierarchy of up mass eigenvalues , associated with the hierarchy of yukawa couplings or of vevs or both . as discussed after ( [ areaud ] ) ,",
    "even after moving the branes from their symmetric positions the up and down yukawas are the same up to relabelling except for the smallest coupling @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the hierarchy @xmath67 would have to come about because the @xmath59 vevs are much larger than those for the @xmath68 , analogous to the large @xmath69 region of the mssm .",
    "this can easily occur for moderate differences in the soft mass - squares , especially if the effective @xmath12 parameters are small .",
    "the full hierarchy of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 ) could most likely be achieved for appropriate soft and effective @xmath41 parameters and kinetic energy terms , but we do not pursue this in detail since these have not been calculated .",
    "similarly , non - trivial quark mixing could be generated by different @xmath27 dependence of the vevs in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 sectors .    in the symmetric case",
    "the charged lepton yukawas are the same as for the up and down quarks , and the charged leptons couple to the same higgs doublets as the down quarks .",
    "this is analogous to the @xmath75 yukawa universality of the simplest version of @xmath76 grand unification , which is successful for large @xmath69 .",
    "( in addition to the @xmath77 yukawa relation at the string scale , one also has @xmath78 unification .",
    "of course , the quark yukawas are enhanced by qcd and other effects in the running down from the string scale , leading to a successful @xmath79 prediction , but a rather large value for @xmath80 . )",
    "the corrections to the lepton yukawas from moving the @xmath81 branes in ( [ arealep ] ) decrease the lepton yukawas relative to the symmetric quark couplings , increasing the @xmath79 prediction .",
    "such a shift is acceptable as long as is small .",
    "the @xmath82 shifts in ( [ areaup ] ) have the same effects on the leptons as the quarks .",
    "one expects dirac neutrino masses comparable to the quark and charged lepton masses close to the symmetric points .",
    "the possibility of a neutrino seesaw was commented on in  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos @xmath83 can not be significantly larger than the scales at which the two additional @xmath4 factors of the model are broken .",
    "it was shown that when the charge confinement and anomaly conditions associated with the strongly coupled quasi - hidden sector are taken into account , then there would be scalar fields with the appropriate quantum numbers to break both @xmath4s at a high scale at which the interactions become strongly coupled .",
    "this could be @xmath84 gev or higher , which could lead to acceptable seesaw mass scales for the neutrinos .",
    "however , the actual potential for those fields and their couplings to the @xmath83 states ( needed to estimate the actual masses and mixings ) would be non - perturbative effects , beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "we have considered the yukawa couplings in a supersymmetric three family standard - like string model . in particular , we have calculated the leading order contributions to the world - sheet instantons associated with the action of the string worldsheet stretching among the intersection points corresponding to the chiral matter fields .",
    "we considered both the case in which the branes are located very close to symmetric positions in the six - torus , which leads to a high degeneracy of yukawa couplings , and the consequences of moving some of the branes away from the symmetric positions .",
    "in general there is a large hierarchy of yukawa couplings , which increases exponentially as the sizes of the tori are increased .",
    "the actual fermion masses depend on the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields , which in turn depend on the supersymmetry breaking and on the effective @xmath41 parameters .",
