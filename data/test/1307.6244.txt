    "the formation of massive stars has a major impact on the surrounding interstellar medium , and regions of massive star formation dominate the star formation appearance of galaxies .",
    "while during the last couple of decades significant progress ( both observational and theoretical ) has been made in the study of massive stars and their parental molecular clouds , we are still far away from a complete picture of their formation process ( for a recent discussion about this subject , see * ? ? ?",
    "* )    massive stars rapidly affect their surroundings , so catching one early in the formation process can provide valuable insights . since they form rarely compared with their low - mass counterpart , most are at large distances , making high resolution observations challenging .",
    "the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) provides the capability to study distant objects in the galaxy with good spatial resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the g331.5 - 0.1 molecular cloud is a giant , elongated ( 178 by 41 pc ) cloud in the norma spiral arm , at a distance of 7.5 kpc , with a total co mass of @xmath3  ( m@xmath4  from c@xmath5o emission ) and a total infrared luminosity of 3.66 ( @xcite ) , making it one of the most active and extreme high - mass star forming environments in our galaxy .",
    "the central region hosts an extended region / infrared source and a number of ultracompact ( uchii ) regions .",
    "maps at submillimeter wavelengths show six continuum sources , with masses above 3 and average gas surface densities of 0.4 g .",
    "single dish spectral line observations with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment and the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) of one of these sources , mm3 , revealed extremely broad ( @xmath6 km s@xmath1 ) wings on lines of co , cs ( bronfman et al . 2008 ) , so , and sio ( merello et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this highly massive and energetic outflow , g331.512@xmath00.103 , is unresolved spatially in a 7  beam .",
    "here we present observations with alma that resolve the g331.512@xmath00.103  molecular outflow , allowing derivation of the outflow properties including age . in forthcoming papers",
    "we will describe the full set of molecular lines observed with alma band 7 .",
    "the observations were performed on 2012 january 12 at frequencies around 350 ghz ( 0.86 mm ) with alma band 7 in cycle 0 with 17 ( 12-m diameter ) antennas in the compact configuration , with baselines ranging from 18.5 m to 269 m. we observed a single field of view centered at @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the primary beam was 17.8  and the synthesized beam was @xmath9 , with a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath10 .",
    "the integration time was 34 minutes on source , with an additional 24 minutes on calibrators . the nearby quasar j1604 - 446 was used for flux calibration , and j1427 - 421 , located at 27.7  from the g331.512@xmath00.103  source ,",
    "was used for phase and bandpass calibrations .",
    "the data were processed using the common astronomy software application ( casa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resulting maps have cells with sizes of 0.14 , with 254 cells in each spatial dimension .",
    "our images were obtained considering a  briggs \" weighting mode on the data with robust=0.5 .",
    "the four spectral windows have a bandwidth of 1875 mhz containing 3840 channels .",

    "table 1 presents the four lines reported in the present work , the noise for each , the peak flux density , and the velocity at the peak .",
    "the rms noise was assessed over a region of 35@xmath1335   centered on the source , avoiding a square area of 11  in size centered on the emission . for line - free channels ,",
    "the noise was @xmath20.014 jy beam@xmath1 .",
    "however , for strong emission lines , the noise is larger , presumably because of incomplete @xmath14 coverage . on the channels of maximum intensity , toward the systemic velocity of the source ,",
    "the noise increases substantially . to be conservative",
    ", we use the noise values at the line velocities in setting thresholds for contours , etc .",
    "moment 0 maps were obtained for each emission line over its full velocity extension , and fwhm angular sizes and p.a.s of these maps were fitted using the task imfit of casa ( columns 6 and 7 of table 1 ) .",
    "physical sizes , considering a source distance of 7.5 kpc , are presented in column 8 of table 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the integrated spectra for the lines described in table 1 . the integration is made over a box of 10.5@xmath1310.5 , centered at @xmath15 , @xmath16 . very wide wings ( up to @xmath17 km s@xmath1 ) are seen on the sio 87 , co 32 , and  43  lines .",
    "the  43  line is narrow toward the systemic velocity of the source ( @xmath18 km s@xmath1 ) , but also shows traces of emission over the red wing of the outflow .",
    "the high velocity wings in the sio profile match those in the apex spectra presented in @xcite , with differences between both profiles of less than 10% , indicating that the alma observations recover all the emission seen in the single - dish spectra .",
    "the co spectrum presents several absorption features at different velocities . besides the self - absorption component at the systemic velocity of the source , an absorption dip at @xmath19 km",
    "s@xmath1  is related to a second velocity component in the central region of the g331.5@xmath00.1  giant molecular cloud , while the large feature between @xmath20 and @xmath21 km s@xmath1  and the one at @xmath22 km s@xmath1  are related to foreground galactic emission identified in @xcite .",
    "the self - absorption dip at @xmath18 km s@xmath1  is also present in the  profile and weakly in the  profile .",
    "the  profile resembles a typical blue - profile found in regions with infalling material @xcite , but observations of a more optically thin molecule , like hc@xmath5o@xmath12 , will be needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "the profile also shows a trace of emission in the red wing of the outflow , with a secondary peak of emission at @xmath23 km s@xmath1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the channel maps of the sio line emission .",

    "these channels define a  bipolar axis \" of symmetry of @xmath25 .",

    "found in the deconvolved moment 0 map of sio , ( p.a .",
    "of 105 ; see table 1 ) .",
    "the integrated intensity sio map shows a ring - type feature toward the systemic velocity of the source ( @xmath26 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "we used the 3 @xmath27 contour level to estimate the outer edge of this emission , obtaining major and minor axes of 5.12@xmath28  and 4.52@xmath29 , respectively , with a p.a .",
    "the deconvolved sizes are then 4.79@xmath300.19  and 4.42@xmath300.35  ( 0.17 pc at the source distance ) , with a p.a . of 137 .",
    "the p.a . of the beam elongation is 175  from this angle , so some of the extension may be beam - related , but the extent is considerably larger than the beam , and the deconvolution should remove that effect .",
    "the inner cavity is centered at @xmath31 , @xmath32 , it has a size of 0.99@xmath130.66 , with a pa of 160 , and it is determined by the 16@xmath27 emission contour .",
    "therefore , the cavity in the sio emission at the systemic velocity is not resolved with the present beam size .",
    "the sio map also shows clumpy , irregular structure at the systemic velocity , with two peaks of emission of 5.0 and 3.9 jy beam@xmath1 , located symmetrically at both sides of the inner cavity .",

    "the line maps are at @xmath33 km s@xmath1 , near the systemic velocity of the source , where the  profile shows the peak of intensity .",
    "the  emission shows a ring shape similar to that seen in sio , with a inner hole coincident with the cavity found in the sio observations , but with most of this emission lying outside the sio ring . the  inner hole has a size of 1.82@xmath131.12 , with a pa of 112 , and it is determined by the 4 @xmath27 emission contour .",
    "the  structure observed at this velocity channel has major and minor axes , considering the 3 @xmath27 contour as the outer edge of this emission , of 8.10@xmath300.32  and 6.79@xmath300.20 , respectively , with a pa of 78 .",
    "the deconvolved angular sizes are then 8.03@xmath300.32  and 6.57@xmath300.22 , with a pa of 76 , which correspond to a geometric mean size of 0.26 pc at the source distance .",
    "the red ellipse in figure 3 represents the 50% contour of the radio continuum source at 8.6 ghz ( merello et al .",
    "the emission at 8.6 ghz is located inside the inner cavity of the sio emission and is unresolved within the beam ( 1.51@xmath130.99 ) .",
    "the sio emission is an indicator of shocked gas , commonly seen around young stellar objects , with enhanced abundance attributed to si being sputtered from dust grains for jet velocities exceeding 25 km s@xmath1(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the wing velocities of the g331.512@xmath00.103  outflow extend to @xmath17 km s@xmath1 , we expected to see sio emission in the wings , likely with a bipolar pattern , and we do .",
    "however , the fact that a ring of sio emission is also present at the systemic velocity , with a cavity of the size of the beam , indicates that a more isotropic high speed wind is producing shocked gas in a shell .",
    "we interpret then that the g331.512@xmath00.103  source corresponds to a jet almost in the line of sight with an expanding shocked shell surrounding its driving source , which in projection is observed as a ring at the systemic velocity .    to explore this hypothesis , we construct position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams of the sio and  emission ( figure 4 ) , for slices along the bipolar axis and perpendicular to it . the cavity is clearly present in all diagrams , centered near @xmath34 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the sio pv diagram along the secondary axis shows two strong peaks nearly symmetric around the cavity .",
    "these two peaks extend around the cavity down to the 16 @xmath27 emission contour ( represented in red in figure 4 ) , extending in velocity between @xmath35 and @xmath36 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the pv diagram along the bipolar axis shows a strong peak at an angular offset of 1 .",
    "the 3 @xmath27 contour of the  traces the red wing of the outflow up to a velocity of @xmath37 km s@xmath1 .",
    "an additional peak is observed at @xmath38 km s@xmath1  along the primary axis , but at @xmath39 km s@xmath1  along the secondary axis .",
    "this emission extends between @xmath40 km s@xmath1 , defined by the 6 @xmath27 contour in the  pv diagram along the symmetry axis , and it has a size of 2.5@xmath131.4(@xmath41 pc ) .",
    "we consider this high - velocity emission likely to be a molecular `` bullet '' , feature sometimes observed in star formation regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bipolar symmetry at the extreme velocities requires a jet - like outflow , but the ring structure at the systemic velocity indicates a nearly isotropic component .",
    "the latter surrounds a region of ionized material , whose expansion could produce the isotropic component .",
    "considering the extension of the symmetric peaks in the pv diagram of sio , we estimate that the expanding shell has a velocity of @xmath224 km s@xmath1 .",
    "a jet originating from the high - mass forming star , the likely source of the radio emission observed at 8.6 ghz , could drive the molecular outflow observed in the high - velocity wings of the sio spectra .",
    "the  emission , being optically thin toward the wings of the outflow , is only tracing the red lobe of this outflow , and the line profile suggests that toward the systemic velocity , some gas is still infalling toward the central star .",
    "however , such a dip can also be created by resolving out ambient cloud emission , so further observations would be needed to test this interpretation .",
    "an estimate for the crossing time is given by @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the diameter of a projected shell , and  the maximum velocity relative to the ambient gas .",
    "using @xmath44 km s@xmath1 , we obtain @xmath45 yr for the inner hole and @xmath22000 yr for the sio ring with diameter 3  ( or 0.11 pc , considered as the middle point between the inner and outer edges of the ring ) .",
    "these estimates would make this source one of the youngest examples of flows around massive forming stars . the momentum ( @xmath46  km s@xmath1 ) and kinetic energy ( 1.4 erg ) of the outflow were measured by @xcite from co(7 - 6 ) observations .",
    "taking 2000 years as the relevant time , the resulting force is 1.2  km s@xmath1  yr@xmath1 and the mechanical luminosity is 6.43 , both higher than any values found in the compilation of outflow properties by @xcite .",
    "the mass of the  emission toward the ambient gas and the bullet is estimated considering a local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) formalism and optically thin emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "considering an excitation temperature of 100 k , a mean molecular weight @xmath47 = 2.72 @xmath48 , and an abundance [ /h@xmath49 = 3.3@xmath50 @xcite , the lte mass of the ambient gas and the bullet are 36  and 1.8 , respectively .",
    "the continuum emission was determined from regions of the alma band 7 spectrum that appeared to be line free , though we can not rule out some level of contamination by line emission .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : h13cop_sio ] shows the 0.86 mm continuum emission , overlaid on the h@xmath11co@xmath12 emission at @xmath51 km s@xmath1 .",
    "a point - like source lies within the ring of sio and  emission , and a more extended component agrees well with the ring .",
    "the continuum emission has a fwhm of 2.94@xmath132.18  and a total flux of 4.3 jy .",
    "this emission could arise from either free@xmath0free emission from a very dense ionized wind or from dust emission , or a combination . as a test",
    ", we estimated the integrated flux of the continuum emission with a point source removed at the peak position of the 8.6 ghz continuum emission showed in figure 3 , obtaining a value of 3.9 jy .",
    "this integrated flux of the continuum emission is much less than the 66.7 jy measured at this wavelength in a 33  region @xcite , but much more than would be expected from a uniformly distributed emission , therefore we associate this emission with an envelope around the central object .",
    "if we attribute this measured flux to dust emission , we can estimate mass and other properties of the source . at a radius of 1 , or 0.036 pc at the source distance , and a luminosity of 75  @xcite",
    ", the equilibrium dust temperature would be @xmath52 k , for a range of dust properties .",
    "assuming 400 k , and using oh5 opacities , the mass estimated in a region of 2.9  in size , or 0.11 pc , would be 38 , implying a mass surface density of 5140  pc@xmath53 , or 1.07 g cm@xmath53 , and a mean volume density of 1.36 .",
    "an interesting comparison can be made to the outflow from g5.89 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which also shows a shell morphology along with a bipolar flow .",
    "the expansion age for the uchii region is 600 yr , measured from multi - epoch observations @xcite , while the bipolar outflow is older , with estimates ranging from 3000 to 7700 yr .",
    "estimates of the outflow properties vary , but the values in the @xcite compilation are a mass of 70 , a momentum of 1600 km s@xmath1 , and a mechanical luminosity of 1600 . in comparison with the g5.89 source ,",
    "the g331.512@xmath00.103  outflow has a shorter age and a higher mechanical luminosity and momentum .",
    "we have performed a study with alma band 7 of the massive and energetic molecular outflow g331.512@xmath00.103 .",
    "the high angular resolution observations allow us to resolve this source in a set of four molecular lines : sio(8 - 7 ) , h@xmath11co@xmath12(4 - 3 ) , hco@xmath12(4 - 3 ) and co(3 - 2 ) .",
    "the sio emission is confined in a region of size less than 5  ( 0.18 pc at a distance of 7.5 kpc ) , and reveal the presence of a ring - type structure toward the systemic velocity of the source .",
    "this feature is also observed in the  line , and the cavity is coincident with a strong and compact radio continuum source observed at 8.6 ghz .",
    "we interpret these observations as a young stellar object producing a compact region , with an expansion shock propagating into the medium and possibly with dense material still infalling around this shell .",
    "co , hco@xmath12 and sio observations trace the full extension of the outflow wings , but the h@xmath11co@xmath12 only traces the red wing , also showing the possible presence of a bullet of dense material .",
