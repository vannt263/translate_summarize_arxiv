    "quantum disordered systems is a very active research field in condensed matter physics ( cm ) initiated by the work by p.w .",
    "anderson @xcite who first pointed out that quenched ( _ i.e. _ time - independent ) disorder can dramatically change the properties of a quantum system compared to its long - range ordered counterpart .",
    "hence , disorder plays a central role in modern solid state physics as it can significantly alter electronic normal conductivity @xcite , superconductivity @xcite and the magnetic @xcite properties of dirty alloys .",
    "it is by now clear that studying disordered systems is comparable to opening the _ pandora box_. on the one hand , disorder introduces a list of non - negligible difficulties .",
    "first , averaging over disorder usually turns out to be a complex task that requires either original methods such as the replica trick @xcite and supersymmetry @xcite or numerical computations using huge samples or a large number of repetitions with different configurations .",
    "second , the possible existence of a huge number of excited states with infinitely small excitation energies leads to complex quantum phases such as bose glasses @xcite or spin glasses @xcite .",
    "third , the interplay of kinetic energy , particle - particle interactions and disorder is usually a non - trivial problem @xcite which is still challenging . on the other hand",
    ", disorder leads to an extraordinary variety of physical phenomena such as , for example , anderson localization @xcite , quantum percolation @xcite , or quantum frustration @xcite .",
    "studies of quantum disorder in cm have several limitations .",
    "first , the disorder can not be controlled as it is fixed by the specific realization of the sample .",
    "in particular , one can not switch adiabatically from one configuration to another .",
    "second , the particles are fermions ( electrons ) and the inter - particle interaction corresponds to the coulomb long - range potential .",
    "third , theoretical studies rely on toy models and experiments do not provide control parameters .",
    "thus , it would be highly desirable to consider new kinds of disordered quantum systems . as shown in this work and",
    "also discussed in other papers @xcite , one exciting possibility is that of ultracold atomic gases where these problems can be revisited with unique parameters control and measurements possibilities .      following the recent progress in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms @xcite , dilute atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , degenerate fermi gases ( dfg ) @xcite and mixtures of both @xcite are now currently produced at the laboratory . in these systems",
    "almost all parameters prove to be highly controllable @xcite : ( i ) using standard techniques , one can easily control the trapping potential , the size , the density and the temperature of the atomic gas . (",
    "ii ) due to the strong dilution , the contact interactions are usually small and can be computed _",
    "ab initio_. in addition , their sign and strength can be controlled using feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "( iii ) quantum statistics is also a degree of freedom as one can use bosons or fermions .",
    "( iv ) finally , inhomogeneous trapping potentials can be designed almost at will using standard optical techniques .",
    "in particular , periodic potentials ( optical lattices ) with no defect nor phonons can be designed in a wide variety of geometries @xcite .",
    "controlled disordered @xcite or quasi - disordered @xcite potentials can also be optically produced opening new possibilities .",
    "hence , equilibrium and transport properties of interacting bose - einstein condensates in random potentials have been investigated in recent experiments @xcite .    in recent works",
    "@xcite , we have shown that fermi - bose mixtures in an optical lattice with diagonal ( _ i.e. _ with random on - site energy ) randomness constitute a case study of quantum disordered systems . in the strongly correlated regime ( strong interactions )",
    ", the dynamics reduces to a universal effective hamiltonian whose parameters can be controlled through the boson - boson and fermion - boson interactions , or the depth of the periodic and disordered potentials .",
    "it results in a rich quantum phase diagram ranging from fermi glasses and fermi anderson localization to quantum spin glasses and quantum percolation @xcite .",
    "this paper reviews our works on strongly correlated fermi - bose mixtures in disordered optical lattices .",
    "it further details the results discussed in ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have presented a complete study of the system and discussed a wide variety of cases , including several composite types and quantum phases .",
    "as in such a rich system , completeness competes with conciseness , we think that a shorter review would be useful for non - specialist readers .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide such a concise review of our findings .",
    "we have thus chosen to restrict the present analysis to a specific case that proves to be non the less paradigmatic but also one of the richest ones . for more details",
    ", the interested reader should refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : strongly ] , we introduce the model describing the considered system ( [ sec : fbhm ] ) and the composite fermions formalism that leads to the effective hamiltonian ( [ sec : composites ] and [ sec : effective ] ) . section  [ sec : weak ] shows the results for the non - disordered and weakly disordered lattices and in section  [ sec : spinglass ] the strong disorder limit , the spin glass limit , is discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ]",
    "consider a mixture of ultracold bosons ( b ) and spinless ( or spin - polarized ) fermions ( f ) trapped in an optical lattice . in addition , the mixture is subjected to on - site inhomogeneities consisting in a harmonic confining potential and/or in diagonal disorder .",
    "eventually , the periodic potential and the inhomogeneities are different for the bosons and the fermions .",
    "however , we assume that the lattices for the two species have the same periodicity .",
    "the lattice sites are indexed by @xmath0 and are thus the same for the fermions and the bosons . in all cases considered below ,",
    "the temperature is assumed to be low enough and the potential wells deep enough so that only quantum states in the fundamental bloch bands for both the bosons and the fermions are populated .",
    "notice that , this requires that the filling factor for fermions @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath2 _ i.e. _ the total number of fermions @xmath3 is smaller than the total number of lattice sites @xmath4 .",
    "we use the wannier basis of the fundamental bloch band which corresponds to wave - functions well localized in each lattice site @xcite for both the bosons and the fermions .",
    "this basis is particularly well suited for the strongly correlated regime that is investigated here @xcite .",
    "then , the second quantization hamiltonian reduces to the fermi - bose hubbard ( fbh ) model @xcite  : @xmath5 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_i \\left[\\frac{v}{2 } n_i(n_i-1 ) + u n_i m_i \\right ] \\label{hamiltonian } \\\\ & & + \\sum_i \\left[-\\mu^\\textrm{b}_i n_i -\\mu^\\textrm{f}_i m_i \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are bosonic and fermionic annihilation operators of a particle in the @xmath0-th site and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the corresponding on - site number operators .",

    "eventually , @xmath14 and @xmath15 also contain the chemical potentials in grand canonical description .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the properties of the strong coupling regime , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 and we derive a one - species effective hamiltonian using a perturbative development up to second order in @xmath17 .      in the limit of a vanishing hopping ( @xmath18 ) with finite repulsive boson - boson interaction @xmath12 , and in the absence of interactions between bosons and fermions ( @xmath19 ) , the bosons are pinned in the lattice sites with exactly @xmath20 bosons per site , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denotes the integer part of @xmath23 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath24 for all sites so that the boson system is in the mott insulator ( mi ) phase with @xmath2 boson per site . in contrast , the fermions can be in any set of wannier states , since for a vanishing tunneling , the energy of the system does not depend on the distribution of the fermions in different lattice sites for the homogeneous optical lattice and will be very similar for the different repartitions of fermions in the case of small disorder .",
    "assume now that the boson - fermion interaction is turned on positive ( @xmath25 ) and define @xmath26 .",
    "the presence of a fermion in site @xmath0 may expel @xmath27 boson depending on the interaction strength . the on - site energy gain in expelling @xmath28 boson from site",
    "@xmath0 is @xmath29 . minimizing @xmath30 versus @xmath28",
    ", we find that @xmath31 that we assume to be @xmath2 in all sites . within the occupation number basis , excitations correspond to having @xmath2 boson in a site with a fermion , instead of @xmath32 boson and , therefore , the corresponding excitation energy is @xmath33 . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the temperature is smaller than @xmath13 so that the populations of the above mentioned excitations can be neglected .    summarizing the discussion above ,",
    "we have assumed that @xmath34 ( so that @xmath24 ) , @xmath35 ( so that in the lowest energy states , each lattice site is populated by either one boson or one fermion but never @xmath32 or @xmath36 particles ) , and @xmath37 ( so that only these lowest energy states are significantly populated ) .",
    "the physics of our fermi - bose mixture can thus be regarded as the one of composite particles made of one fermion plus one bosonic hole .",
    "notice that the bosonic hole is created because the initially present boson is expelled from the site by the fermion , due to the repulsive interactions between bosons and fermions . within the picture of composites ,",
    "a lattice site is either populated by one composite ( i.e. by one fermion plus bosonic hole ) or free of composite ( i.e. populated by one boson ) .",

    "we assume now that the tunneling rates @xmath43 and @xmath44 are small but finite . for weak enough disorder",
    ", one can assume site independent tunneling rates for bosons and fermions @xcite .",
    "using second order projection perturbation theory @xcite , we derive an effective hamiltonian for the fermionic composites by means of a unitary transform applied to the total hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "the nearest neighbor hopping for the composites is described by @xmath54 and the nearest neighbor composite - composite interaction is given by @xmath53 , which may be repulsive ( @xmath55 ) or attractive ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this effective model is equivalent to that of spinless interacting fermions @xcite .    in the situation under consideration",

    "the mzard - parisi picture _ predicts a large number of low - energy states with very similar energies .",
    "this leads in particular to _ disorder - induced quantum frustration_. this theory is a mean - field , based on the _ replica method _ which is a special trick introduced to compute the non - trivial average over disorder of the free energy functional .",
    "the mzard - parisi theory is formulated in long - range spin glasses such as the sherrington - kirkpartick model @xmath154 that differs from the edwards - anderson model  ( [ hamiltoniansg ] ) by the long - range spin exchange [ @xmath155 denotes here the sum over _ all _ pairs of lattice sites , either neighbors or not ] .",
    "the applicability of the mzard - parisi picture to short - range spin glasses is still controversial .",
    "as the disorder is quenched , one must average over disorder the free energy density , @xmath156 using the _ replica trick_. in the following we assume that the random variables @xmath71 and @xmath48 are gaussian distributed with average @xmath143 and @xmath157 respectively and standard deviation @xmath144 and @xmath158 respectively .",
    "we form @xmath159 identical copies of the system ( the _ replicas _ ) and the average is calculated for an integer @xmath159 and a finite number of spins @xmath4 . then , using the well - known formula @xmath160 , @xmath161 is obtained from the analytic continuation of @xmath162 for @xmath163 . finally , we take the thermodynamic limit @xmath164 .",

    "computing the average over disorder leads to coupling between spin - spin - interactions of different replicas .",
    "after some analytics that are detailed in @xcite , one finally gets @xmath167 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath168 these are characteristic values of spinglasses that may be measured in experimental realizations of the proposed systems .    finally , a study of stability of the replica method as detailed in @xcite shows that the magnetization constraint specific to our model would not change the occurrence of replica symmetry breaking , provided the mzard - parisi approach is valid in finite range spin glass models .",
    "in this paper , we have reviewed our recent theoretical works on fermi - bose mixtures in disordered optical lattices . in the strongly correlated regime and under constraints that we have discussed in detail",
    ", the physics of the mixture can be mapped into that of single - species fermi composites .",
    "this is governed by a fermi - hubbard like hamiltonian with parameters that can be controlled with accuracy in state - of - the - art experiments on ultracold atoms .",
    "we have shown that the presence of disorder ( created by random on - site energies ) introduces further control possibilities and induces an extraordinary rich quantum phase diagram .",
    "for the sake of conciseness , we have restricted our discussion to a particular regime that proves to be a case study ( more details may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for weak disorder",
    ", we have discussed the phase diagram which corresponds to the formation of fermi glass , domain insulator , dirty superfluids and metallic phases .",
    "numerical calculations support our discussion .    for larger amplitudes of disorder",
    ", we have shown that the hamiltonian reduces to that of a spinglass , _",
    "i.e. _ a spin system with random exchange terms . in our system ,",
    "the fictitious spins are coded by the presence or the absence of particles in each lattice site .",
    "the physics of spinglasses is a challenging problem in statistical physics which is still unsolved .",
    "in particular , two theories are competing : the _ droplet picture _ and the _ mzard - parisi picture_. these two theories lead to different predictions and even the nature of ordering in spinglasses is not known . on the one hand ,",
    "the mzard - parisi picture , which is assumed to be valid for long - range spin exchange , predicts the existence of a huge number of quantum states with very similar energies that all contribute to the low - temperature physics of spinglasses . on the other hand ,",
    "the droplet picture , which is believed to be valid for short spin exchange , assumes the existence of only two pure states connected by spin flip symmetry and excitations are domains of constant magnetization with fractal boundaries . as possible experimental realizations of spinglass systems with controllable parameters , mixtures of ultracold fermions and bosons",
