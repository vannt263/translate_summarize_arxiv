    "wireless powered communication network has arisen as a new system with stable and self - sustainable power supplies in shaping future - generation wireless communications @xcite .",
    "the enabling technology , known as simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) , has particularly drawn an upsurge of interests owing to the far - field electromagnetic power carried by radio - frequency ( rf ) signals that affluently exist in wireless communications . with the transmit power , waveforms , and dimensions of resources , etc .",
    ", being all fully controllable , swipt promises to prolong the lifetime of wireless devices while delivering the essential communication functionality , as will be important for low - power applications such as rf identification ( rfid ) and wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    on the other hand , privacy and authentication",
    "have increasingly become major concerns for wireless communications and physical ( phy)-layer security has emerged as a new layer of defence to realize perfect secrecy transmission in addition to the costly upper - layer techniques such as cryptography . in this regard , relay - assisted secure transmission was proposed @xcite and phy - layer security enhancements by means of cooperative communications have since attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "in particular , cooperative schemes can be mainly classified into three categories : _ decode - and - forward ( df ) _ , _ amplify - and - forward ( af ) _ , and _ cooperative jamming ( cj ) _",
    "@xcite with cj being most relevant to phy - layer security .",
    "specifically , coordinated cj refers to the scheme of generating a common jamming signal across all single - antenna relay helpers against eavesdropping @xcite , while uncoordinated cj considers that each relay helper emits independent artificial noise ( an ) to confound the eavesdroppers @xcite .",
    "it is expected that in the scenarios where the direct link is broken between the transmitter ( tx ) and the legitimate receiver ( rx ) , some of the relays have to take on their conventional role of forwarding the information while others will perform cj @xcite .",
    "a recent paradigm that generalizes all the above - mentioned cooperation strategies is _ cooperative beamforming ( cb ) mixed with cj _",
    "@xcite , where the available power at each relay is split into two parts : one for forwarding the confidential message and the other for cj .",
    "however , mixed cb - cj approaches may be prohibitive in applications with low power devices because idle relays with limited battery supplies would likely prefer saving power for their own traffic to assisting others communication . in light of this",
    ", swipt provides the incentive for potential helpers to perform dedicated cb mixed with cj at no expense of its own power , but opportunistically earn harvested energy .",
    "motivated by this , our work considers secrecy transmission from a tx to a legitimate rx with the aid of a set of single - antenna wireless energy harvesting ( weh)-enabled af - operated relays in the presence of multiple single - antenna eavesdroppers . as a matter of fact",
    ", cooperative schemes that involve weh - enabled relays was recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "we consider the use of the _ dynamic power splitting ( dps ) _ receiver architecture , initially proposed for swipt in @xcite , which divides the received power with an adjustable ratio for energy harvesting ( eh ) and information receiving ( ir ) .",
    "weh - enabled relays using dps receivers have also been considered in @xcite and @xcite , without ( w / o ) and with secrecy consideration , respectively .",
    "note that there is also interest in addressing the threat that weh receivers may attempt to intercept the confidential messages in swipt - enabled networks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will focus on exploiting the benefits of weh - enabled relays when they are trustful .",
    "in particular , motivated by the strong interest in swipt and the vast degree - of - freedom ( dof ) achievable by cooperative relays , this paper aims to maximize the secrecy rate with the aid of weh - enabled af - operated relays , subject to the eh power constraints of individual relays by jointly optimizing the cb of the relays and the cj covariance matrix . in this paper",
    ", we assume that there is no direct link between the source and destination nodes , and perfect global channel state information ( csi ) is available for the case of centralized optimization .",
    "it is worth pointing out that although our setting may look similar to @xcite , their optimal cb - cj design is not applicable to ours due to the multiplicative nature in beamforming weights incurred by the power splitting ( ps ) ratios that intrinsically poses more intractability to our optimization problem .",
    "further , our work also differs from @xcite where an efficient algorithm was proposed to maximize the secrecy rate for the optimization of the ps ratios and af relay beamforming .",
    "the difference is twofold .",
    "first , an was not considered in the second transmission phase in @xcite and in addition , their algorithm only converged to a local optimum , as opposed to our work that gives the global optimal solutions for cb .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : system model ] describes two types of weh - enabled rx architecture for the af relays and defines the secrecy rate region of the relay wiretap channel .",
    "section  [ sec : problem formulation ] then formulates the secrecy rate maximization problems that jointly optimize the an ( or cj ) and the af - relay cb for the weh - enabled relays operating with the two types of rx .",
    "the problems are respectively solved by centralized schemes in section  [ sec : centralized ] and distributed approaches in section  [ sec : distributed ] .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical results ] provides simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes .",

    "in this paper , we consider secrecy transmission in a swipt - enabled wsn , where a tx ( alice ) wants to establish confidential communication with the legitimate rx ( bob ) with no direct link but with the aid of @xmath19 weh - enabled sensors operating as af relays , denoted by @xmath20 , in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers ( eves ) , denoted by @xmath21 , all equipped with single antenna .",
    "we assume that there is no direct link from the tx to any of the eves , due to , for instance , severe path loss or shadowing , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] .",
    "we consider a two - hop relaying protocol based on two equal time slots and the duration of one transmit - slot is normalized to be one unit so that the terms `` energy '' and `` power '' are interchangeable with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "one transmit - slot .    at the receiver of each af relay , we introduce two types of weh - enabled receiver architecture , namely , _ static power splitting ( sps ) _ ( fig .  [ fig : subfig : sps rx ] ) and _ dps _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig : dps rx ] ) , both of which allow the relay to harvest energy and receive information from the same received signal .",
    "specifically , the receiver first splits a portion of @xmath22 , of the received power for eh and the rest @xmath23 for ir , @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath22 portion of harvested power is further divided into two streams with @xmath25 used for generating the an to confound eves and @xmath26 used for amplifying the received signal , where @xmath27 is the @xmath11th element of the received signal @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denotes the eh efficiency .",
    "note that dps with adjustable @xmath22 s is presently the most general receiver operation because practical circuits can not directly decode the information from the stream used for eh @xcite and sps is just a special case of dps with @xmath30 , @xmath24 , fixed for the whole transmission duration .",
    "however , sps , advocated for its ease of implementation , is introduced separately in the sequel for its simplified relay beamforming design . in the first transmit - slot , the received signal at each individual relay can be expressed as @xmath31 where the transmit signal @xmath32 is a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with zero mean and unit variance , denoted by @xmath33 , @xmath34 denotes the complex channel from the tx to the @xmath11th relay , @xmath35 is the transmit power at the tx , and @xmath36 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) introduced by the receiving antenna of the @xmath11th relay , denoted by @xmath37 . as such , the linearly amplified baseband equivalent signal at the output of the @xmath11th relay",

    "for example , a larger @xmath295 indicates that each relay prefers to splitting a larger portion of power for jamming and vice versa .",

    "next , since an individual relay can not evaluate the secrecy performance of the whole system , @xmath44 s are simply chosen to be the optimum for the multi - af relaying without security considerations , i.e. , @xmath298 , @xmath24 .      following the same designs for @xmath112 s and @xmath44 s in section  [ sec : distributed alg . for sps",

    "furthermore , denoting @xmath468_{i , i}^{1/2}]_{i=1}^n$ ] by @xmath251 , it is easily checked that the diagonal entries remain the same after we replace @xmath250 with @xmath252 . combining the above two facts , we arrive at the conclusion that such modification does not affect its optimality while returning a rank - one @xmath250 for @xmath238 , which completes the proof for @xmath405 .",

    "<S> this paper studies secrecy transmission with the aid of a group of wireless energy harvesting ( weh)-enabled amplify - and - forward ( af ) relays performing cooperative jamming ( cj ) and relaying . </S>",
    "<S> the source node in the network does _ simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) _ with each relay employing a power splitting ( ps ) receiver in the first phase ; each relay further divides its harvested power for forwarding the received signal and generating artificial noise ( an ) for jamming the eavesdroppers in the second transmission phase . in the centralized case with global channel state information ( csi ) , we provide closed - form expressions for the optimal and/or suboptimal af - relay beamforming vectors to maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to individual power constraints of the relays , using the technique of semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) , which is proved to be tight . a fully _ distributed _ algorithm utilizing only local csi at each relay is also proposed as a performance benchmark . </S>",
