    "in recent studies on non - equilibrium thermodynamics , the entropy production rate ( ep ) has been highlighted as a promising determinant of self - organized ordered structures .",
    "the minimum ep ( minep ) principle succeeded to describe various structures self - organized in nonlinear dissipative systems  @xcite .",
    "the minep principle has its historical origin in helmholtz minimum dissipation principle that determines the velocity distribution of a stationary viscous flow  @xcite .",
    "l. onsager generalized this principle to a variational principle relating thermodynamic forces ( potentials ) and fluxes  @xcite .",
    "the minep principle proposed by i. prigogine , independently rooted in the study of linear discontinuous systems , has extended the scope ( by hypothetical studies ) toward various nonlinear systems .",
    "i. gyarmati showed the equivalence of onsager s variational principle and the minep principle in a linear dissipative system  @xcite . a literal application of ep in the variational principle , however",
    ", may lead to an improper result .",
    "for example , consider a heat diffusion on a homogeneous medium where fick s law @xmath0 ( @xmath1 : heat flux , @xmath2 : temperature , @xmath3 : diffusion coefficient ) applies .",
    "then , the total ep is the volume integral @xmath4 , which , however , is not the target of minimization leading to fourier s law ( which must be @xmath5 ) .    at the opposite pole to the expanded narrative of minep , examples of `` maximizing '' ep have been found in various non - equilibrium systems , suggesting the possibility of antithetical `` maximum ep ( maxep ) '' principle .",
    "g. w. paltridge showed , in his pioneering work  @xcite , that the atmospheric heat transfer from the tropical to the polar regions maximizes ep in a sense that the temperature contrast tends to be enhanced compared to that of simple heat diffusion ; see also  @xcite .",
    "maxep states are often found in turbulent fluid systems .",
    "ozawa  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that fluid - mechanical instabilities play an essential role in increasing ep a nonlinear regime .",
    "yoshida and mahajan  @xcite formulated a thermodynamic model of heat transfer through a self - organizing fluid ( plasma ) , demonstrating the bifurcation of a maxep operation mode ; it is shown that the maxep branch is stable when the system is `` flux - driven , '' i.e. the heat flux driving the non - equilibrium system is the parameter that controls the operation mode ; the opposite is a `` force - driven '' system , in which a thermodynamic force ( for instance , a temperature difference between two boundaries connected to heat baths ) is the control parameter .",
    "we note that , in usual plasma experiments ( as well as in most natural processes , like atmospheric heat transfer driven by solar heat source ) , the input power is controlled ( or , given as a determining parameter ) , which must be transferred to some heat sink in a steady state , thus the `` flux '' is the controlling parameter . on the other hand , theoretical analysis or",
    "a computational study often uses a force - driven model giving a boundary condition on the intensive quantities ( like the temperature ) .",
    "mathematically , a flux - driven condition and a force - driven condition correspond to a neumann boundary condition and a dirichlet boundary condition , respectively ( one may consider a mixed - type boundary condition if appropriate ) .",
    "statistical mechanical theories build a foundation for the use of ep as a scalar in variational principle : r. c. dewar  @xcite related ep to the count of `` paths '' in phase space by invoking jaynes formalism  @xcite .",
    "r. k. niven  @xcite proposed a different information - theoretic evaluation of ep ; he also pointed out that the driving condition ( what he calls a `` flow controlled '' system is equivalent to the aforementioned flux - driven system ) is essential to yield a maxep state .    here , we note that a `` maximum '' ep does not mean the maximization of the dissipation function in a transient / local process ; in fact , transient / local ep is bounded only from below .",
    "we say maximum or minimum by comparing the total ep of _ bifurcated _ operation points in ( quasi ) stationary states . in a general nonlinear system , total ep",
    "may be changed by a structure ( flow in a fluid / plasma system ) on a large scale , even if the ultimate dissipation occurs on a small scale ( such as the kolmogorov scale ) .",
    "the maxep state is the operating mode with the largest ep among possible modes of ( quasi ) stationary states ( other authors say `` global maximum / minimum of ep ''  @xcite ) . in view of the rich phenomenologies and various theoretical interpretations",
    ", it may be useful to develop a simple paradigm by which one can compare basic structures as well as the modes of operation ( or drive ) of systems .",
    "for this purpose , the problem of heat transfer in a plasma provides appropriate examples ; a plasma is a strongly nonlinear system which exhibits various aspects of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "as pointed out by yoshida and mahajan  @xcite , a typical example of bifurcation of a maxep state is the h - mode  @xcite , which is stably sustained by a given large - enough heat flux .",
    "recently formulated variational principle of non - equilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite can determine the stable operating point of a nonlinear system ( modeled by a nonlinear impedance ) , and evaluate either maximum or minimum ep depending on how the system is driven ( or sustained ) ; the min / max duality is described by a legendre transformation of a _",
    "generalized dissipation function_.    in the present study , we discuss not only how the system is driven but also how the nonlinear impedance is `` arranged . '' in the h - mode , the nonlinearity of the thermal conduction is caused by the self - organization of a _ zonal flow _ that is directed perpendicular to the heat flow ; its strong shear suppresses the turbulence , resulting an increased impedance of heat transport .",
    "however , there is another type of self - organization of an ordered flow in fluid mechanics , known as bnard convection , and in plasma physics , called `` streamer ''  @xcite which brings about an `` opposite '' effect on heat transport ; such a flow parallels to the direction of heat flow and causes convective heat transport , resulting in a reduced impedance of heat transport . while the zonal flow blocks the thermal conduction , the streamer opens up a new channel of heat transfer . to model these two different structures by _ equivalent circuits _ , we consider two different topologies of connecting a nonlinear impedance to a `` baseline '' impedance ; one is series connection and the other is parallel connection ( here , the baseline is determined by the impedance observed when the macroscopic flow is absent , i.e. _ before _ the self - organization ) . the blocking ( series )",
    "impedance changes from zero to a finite value as the zonal flow grows and suppresses the turbulent heat transport ( the baseline impedance is that of the turbulent heat transport ) . the bypath ( parallel ) impedance , on the other hand , changes from infinity to a finite value as the streamer glows ( the baseline impedance is that of classical heat diffusion ) .",
    "the aim of this study is to describe an abstract ( general ) balance law that dictates bifurcation , stability , and ep of operation points ( quasi - stationary macroscopic states ) in a nonlinear driven system ; such a thermodynamic relation will be `` mechanism free , '' hence specifying the mechanisms that yield nonlinear impedances or control which type of flow self - organizes is not the subject of the present practice .",
    "here we refer to a limited number of theoretical arguments on relevant mechanisms of self - organization .",
    "the creation of a zonal flow is explained by the so - called @xmath6 term in the rossby wave equation@xcite and its cousin hasgawa - mima equation of drift wave ( see a review paper@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a bnard convection is caused by a buoyancy term measuring a baroclinic effect ( which is related to an inhomogeneity of entropy caused by the gravity ; see@xcite ) .",
    "a `` bifurcation '' of the zonal flow and the streamer has been studied for magnetic - curvature driven rayleigh - taylor instabilities , showing that the strength of dissipation is the control parameter@xcite .",
    "we consider a layer bounded on one side by a high temperature core plasma ( temperature @xmath2 ) and on the other side by a low temperature outer region ( heat bath with temperature @xmath7 ) .",
    "the temperature difference ( thermodynamic force ) and the heat flux are related by a thermal impedance @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "when the system is flux - driven , a heat flux @xmath10 is given , and then , the inner boundary temperature @xmath2 is a dependent variable . on the other hand , in a temperature - driven system",
    ", the temperature difference @xmath11 is given , and @xmath10 is a dependent variable .",
    "we start by reviewing the thermodynamic model of h - mode / zonal flow self - organization  @xcite . in a turbulent heat transport ,",
    "the thermal impedance @xmath8 may be written as a sum of two components @xmath12 ; @xmath13 represents the background ( baseline ) turbulent heat transport , and @xmath14 represents a blocking impedance modeling the suppression of turbulent heat transport by a zonal flow .",
