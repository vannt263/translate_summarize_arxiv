    "dark matter plays an important role in the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "however , little is known about the nature of dark matter , but it has become clear that the simplest paradigm , that of collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) , can explain the observed structure in the universe quite well .",
    "numerical simulations , which provide a powerful way to study the formation of structure in the universe , indicate that cdm gives rise to a particular density profile ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) . in these simulations",
    ", the nfw profile appears to be an excellent description of the radial mass distribution for halos with a wide range in mass .",
    "the density profile on small scales , however , remains controversial as other groups find different results ( e.g. , ghigna et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , realistic simulations should include the effect of baryons , which complicate matters even further . on the other hand ,",
    "there is good agreement for the density profile on large scales , and a comparison of the profiles of real objects with the predictions provides an important test of the assumption that structures form through dissipationless collapse .",
    "clusters of galaxies are particularly well suited for such a comparison , because their formation can be simulated fairly well .",
    "unfortunately , because clusters are dark matter dominated , it is difficult to measure the mass distribution at large radii from the cluster centre .",
    "dynamical estimators can be used , but assumptions have to be made about the shape of the cluster , its dynamical state , and the velocity anisotropies ( e.g. , van der marel et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a promising approach is that of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the tidal gravitational field of the cluster distorts the images of distant background galaxies .",
    "this distortion can be measured and can be used to reconstruct the projected mass density of the cluster ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ) .",
    "the advantage of weak lensing over dynamical methods is that the results do not rely on the dynamical state or the nature of the deflecting matter .",
    "more importantly , it does not require a tracer of the gravitational potential ( which limits many dynamical methods ) , and as a result the lensing signal can be measured out to large radii from the cluster centre .",
    "the weak lensing signal induced by galaxy clusters has been measured for a large number of systems ( e.g. , bonnet , mellier & fort 1994 ; fahlman et al .",
    "1994 ; clowe et al .",
    "2000 ; hoekstra et al . 2002a ; squires et al .",
    "these early studies were limited by the field of view of the ccd cameras used in the observations . with the recent introduction of wide field imagers",
    "it is now possible to measure the lensing signal out to large radii ( clowe & schneider 2001 , 2002 ) or study the mass distribution in superclusters ( e.g. , kaiser et al .",
    "1998 ; gray et al . 2002 ) .",
    "many other weak lensing applications are discussed in hoekstra , yee & gladders ( 2002b ) .",
    "the lensing signal at large radii is low , and special care has to be taken to correct for observational distortions , such as psf anisotropy , seeing and camera shear .",
    "these systematic signals typically have amplitudes comparable to the lensing signal one is interested in .",
    "fortunately , detailed studies have shown that the lensing signal can be recovered with great accuracy ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "1998 ; erben et al .",
    "2001 ; bacon et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "however , another source of error is usually ignored : the contribution of large scale structure .",
    "the weak lensing signal is sensitive to all matter along the line of sight . in general ,",
    "cluster studies assume that the signal introduced by the cluster is so dominant that the contributions from other structures can be neglected .",
    "the effect of local large scale structure ( such as the filaments connecting clusters and groups ) on cluster mass estimates has been studied through numerical simulations ( cen 1997 ; metzler et al .",
    "1999 ; white et al . 2002 ) .",
    "these studies show that local structures introduce both a bias and additional noise in the mass measurement .",
    "estimates of cluster mass - to - light ratios are affected less by these structures , as both the mass and the light are expected to probe the same structure .",
    "the study of the contribution from distant large scale structure ( not correlated with the cluster ) requires large cosmological simulations , as one needs to account for all matter along the line of sight .",
    "hoekstra ( 2001 ) demonstrated how the contribution of distant large scale structure can be computed analytically .",
    "hoekstra ( 2001 ) showed that the large scale structure introduces noise in the cluster mass measurement , but does not bias the result .",
    "the results presented by white et al . ( 2002 ) , based on detailed numerical simulations , are in good agreement with the findings from hoekstra ( 2001 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the distant large scale structure does affect the determination of the cluster mass - to - light ratio .",
    "furthermore , the distant large scale structure provides a fundamental limit to the accuracy of weak lensing mass estimates : deeper observations reduce the statistical uncertainty ( because of the intrinsic shapes of the sources ) , but increase the noise from large scale structure ( hoekstra 2001 ) .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that the large scale structure can be an important source of noise for the mass determination of individual objects .",
    "the cluster mass is an integral over the cluster profile , and therefore large scale structure will have an impact on the determination of cluster mass profiles .    local large scale structure and substructure in the cluster",
    "will change the profile .",
    "this was studied by king , schneider & springel ( 2001 ) using a numerical simulation of a cluster .",
    "they found that substructure increases the error on the parameters by only @xmath6 . doubling the amount of substructure resulting in @xmath7 larger errors .",
    "based on these results , king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that weak lensing studies of clusters can be of great use to study mass profiles .",
    "however , king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) did not consider the contribution of distant large scale structure to the error budget . in this paper , we use the approach introduced by hoekstra ( 2001 ) to quantify the contribution of distant large scale structure on measurements of cluster density profiles .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we calculate the contribution of distant large scale structure to the lensing signal .",
    "the lensing properties of the nfw profile are discussed in section  3 .",
    "the effects of distant large scale structure are studied in section  4 , where we consider clusters with different masses and redshifts .",
    "in the weak lensing regime , the coherent distortion of the images of the background galaxies provides a direct measure of the lensing shear @xmath8 as a function of position .",
    "the projected mass distribution of a cluster can be reconstructed in a parameter - free way from the observed shear field ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ) .",
    "the resulting mass map can be used to derive the cluster mass profile . however , the mass reconstruction is a non - local operation , and as a result the noise in the map varies as a function of position .",
    "although one can estimate the noise in non - parametric reconstructions from bootstrap simulations , it is more convenient to use parameterised models which are fitted to the observations . in the latter case",
    "the error properties are well understood . to study the distribution of matter in the cluster , 2-dimensional models can be fitted .",
    "another approach is to consider the azimuthally averaged tangential shear as a function of radius from the centre .",
    "the latter is particularly useful to estimate the mass of the cluster ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "1998 ) or study the mass profile ( e.g. , clowe et al .",
    "2000 ; clowe & schneider 2001 ; clowe & schneider 2002 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "hoekstra ( 2001 ) showed how distant large scale structure affects the mass estimate when a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model is fitted to the tangential shear profile . in this paper",
    "we apply the approach presented in hoekstra ( 2001 ) to estimate how large scale structure affects the measured tangential shear profile .",
    "this allows us to efficiently simulate observations , and quantify the effect of distant large scale structure on the derived cluster profile .",
    "we focus on the nfw profile , which is discussed in section  3 , although the procedure can be readily applied to any model .",
    "the quantity of interest is the tangential shear averaged in an annulus ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "we will show that the tangential shear in an annulus is a filtered measurement of the surface mass density , i.e. , it is a particular choice of the aperture mass statistic @xmath12 ( e.g. , schneider et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the aperture mass is defined as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the weight or filter function .",
    "provided that @xmath14 is compensated , i.e.    @xmath15    the aperture statistic can be related to the tangential shear @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately @xmath16 can not be observed directly , but one can measure the distortion @xmath17 . in the weak lensing regime ,",
    "where @xmath18 , one can use @xmath19 , which is what we do throughout this paper .",
    "hence ,    @xmath20    @xmath21 is related to @xmath14 through    @xmath22    hence , similar to the mass estimate of the cluster ( hoekstra 2001 ) , the tangential shear in an annulus can be written as an aperture mass , with the filter function @xmath21    @xmath23    and the corresponding @xmath24 is    @xmath25    the coefficients @xmath26 are defined as    @xmath27}{\\pi(\\theta_2 ^ 2-\\theta_1 ^ 2)},\\ ] ]    @xmath28    and    @xmath29    under the assumption that the cluster is the only lensing structure in the field , the measured @xmath30 as a function of the distance to the cluster centre can be readily used to study the cluster mass profile : the parameters describing the cluster can be inferred from a least squares fit of the model to the data .",
    "however , the observed weak lensing signal is sensitive to all matter along the line of sight , and other structures ( the distant large scale structure ) will introduce an additional signal , and the observed signal is the sum of the contribution from the cluster and large scale structure    @xmath31    the aperture mass measures a density contrast , and therefore the expectation value for the contribution by uncorrelated large scale structure vanishes ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) . thus on average , distant structures do not bias the measurements , but they introduce and additional statistical uncertainty in the measurement of size @xmath33 . however , because of non - linear gravitational evolution , the distribution of @xmath12 will be skewed ( e.g. , bernardeau et al . 1997 ; schneider 1998 ) . in the analysis we will ignore the skewness , and assume that @xmath12 follows a normal distribution .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of the average tangential shear @xmath34 in a bin ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 is    @xmath35    where @xmath36 corresponds to the uncertainty introduced by the intrinsic shapes of the galaxies and the noise in the shape measurement .",
    "it depends on the number density of sources @xmath37 and the scatter in the ellipticities @xmath38    @xmath39    for the dispersion in the shapes of the sources we adopt a value @xmath40 , similar to what is observed in deep hst images ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "depending on the image quality and depth of the observations , the dispersion is likely to be larger for faint galaxies in ground based data , because of the correction for the circularization by the psf .",
    "the number density of galaxies with @xmath41 is @xmath42 galaxies arcmin@xmath43 in space based observations . in ground based data ,",
    "however , the effective number density of galaxies is lower , because many of the faint galaxies have sizes comparable to the psf , and are not useable in the weak lensing analysis ( i.e. , these galaxies have @xmath44 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt a typical value of @xmath45 galaxies arcmin@xmath43 ( e.g. , bacon et al . ( 2002 ) ) .    the variance in the aperture mass caused by large scale structure",
    "is given by ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 )    @xmath46    where the effective projected power spectrum @xmath47 is given by :    @xmath48    here @xmath49 is the radial coordinate , @xmath50 the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath51 the comoving angular diameter distance .",
    "@xmath52 is the source averaged ratio of angular diameter distances @xmath53 for a redshift distribution of sources @xmath54 :    @xmath55    the function @xmath56 in equation  [ eqmap ] depends on the filter function @xmath24 as    @xmath57    as has been demonstrated in jain & seljak ( 1997 ) and schneider et al .",
    "( 1998 ) it is necessary to use the non - linear power spectrum in equation  14 .",
    "this power spectrum can be derived from the linearly evolved cosmological power spectrum following the prescriptions of hamilton et al .",

    "these results show that @xmath63 declines rather slowly ( @xmath64 ) with increasing @xmath60 , and therefore probes a large range in @xmath60 .    for the analysis in this paper it is convenient to consider the aperture mass statistic @xmath65 , which corresponds to the the average tangential shear measured in an annulus @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "provided that @xmath67 , one obtains a simple form    @xmath68    which is independent of @xmath69 , and is an excellent approximation to the exact calculations .",
    "in the remainder of the paper we will adopt a value of @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ gt_lss ] shows the dispersion @xmath71 in the averaged tangential shear introduced by distant large scale structure . to derive these results",
    ", we have used the redshift distribution presented in hoekstra ( 2001 ) , which are based on photometric redshift studies of the hubble deep fields .",
    "the solid lines shows the results for sources with @xmath41 and the dashed line corresponds to sources with @xmath72 .",
    "the number density and mean source redshifts are higher in deeper observations .",
    "consequently , the lensing signal is higher , and the statistical noise is lower . however , as figure  [ gt_lss ] shows , the effect of large scale structure is also increased , and the actual accuracy of the measurements improves only marginally ( also see hoekstra 2001 ) .    to study the effect of distant large scale structure on the measurement of the cluster mass profile , we create simulated tangential shear profiles .",
    "we include the noise caused by the intrinsic shapes of the background galaxies , and the noise introduced by intervening large scale structure .",
    "the statistical error @xmath73 in each bin , caused by the intrinsic shapes of the sources , is uncorrelated with the other bins .",
    "the noise from large scale structure at various scales is correlated . to properly account for this , we need to compute not only @xmath74 but also the cross correlation coefficient between bins .",
    "the cross - correlation between bins @xmath75 is calculated using    @xmath76    and the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath77 is    @xmath78    the cross - correlation coefficients @xmath79 for three different values of @xmath80 are shown in figure  [ crosscor ] .",
    "the measurements on small scales have small range correlations , whereas at large radii the contribution of large scale structure introduces large scale correlations .    correlated random noise @xmath81 can be obtained by smoothing of the white noise @xmath82 with a an appropriate smoothing kernel @xmath83    @xmath84    where @xmath82 , @xmath81 are random functions with correlators    @xmath85    and    @xmath86    for @xmath82 we take a random number with a gaussian distribution with a dispersion of unity . the smoothing kernel is readily obtained from the cross correlation coefficient .",
    "the correlation coefficient is the convolution of the smoothing kernel with itself .",
    "the smoothing kernel is normalized such that @xmath87 .",
    "numerical simulations have indicated that dark matter halos originating from dissipationless collapse of density fluctuations can be described by a universal density profile ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) . the nfw density profile is given by    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the halo .",
    "the overdensity of the halo is parameterized by @xmath90 , which is related to the concentration parameter @xmath1 through    @xmath91    the scale radius @xmath92 is the characteric radius of the halo , which depends on the virial radius @xmath93 and the concentration parameter @xmath1 as @xmath94 .",
    "the virial radius is defined as the radius where the mass density of the halo is equal to @xmath95 , and the corresponding mass @xmath0 inside this radius is given by    @xmath96    given the cosmology , redshift , and mass of the halo , @xmath93 follows immediately .",
    "the simulations have also shown that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are correlated , albeit with some scatter . hence , given @xmath0 , the values of @xmath90 , and @xmath1 can be computed using the routine charden made available by julio navarrojfn / charden ] . in this case",
    "the halo profile is described by a single parameter , e.g. , the mass .",
    "however , one can also consider @xmath1 as a free parameter in the model .",

    "the critical surface density @xmath99 is given by    @xmath100    where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are , respectively , the angular diameter distances between the observer and the lens , the observer and the source , and the lens and the source .",
    "the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are defined as    @xmath106    and    @xmath107    figure  [ nfw ] shows the tangential shear for a cluster with an nfw profile .",
    "the cluster has a mass @xmath108 , and is at a redshift @xmath3 .",
    "the amplitude of the lensing signal corresponds to that for source galaxies with apparent magnitudes @xmath41 .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ nfw ] corresponds to a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model , which was matched to the nfw model at intermediate radii .    in principle",
    "one can distinguish between the sis model and the nfw profile by examining the lensing signal on either small or large scales . in practice , however , substructure in the cluster core , and contamination of the sample of background galaxies by cluster members , complicates the small scale comparison .",
    "furthermore , the profile on small scales is still debated ( e.g. , ghigna et al .",
    "the lensing signal at large radii can be measured accurately , provided that the shapes have been accurately corrected for observational distortions .",
    "to study cluster mass profiles , it is common to compare a parametrized mass model to the data .",
    "ideally one would like to minimize the number of parameters describing the model . in this section",
    "we consider the nfw profile ( eqn .",
    "24 ) , with @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the only two free parameters .",
    "in addition to these two parameters , one could introduce the slopes of the profile on small and large scales .    to examine",
    "how well we can constrain the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we create simulated tangential shear profiles as described in section  2 .",
    "the profiles include the statistical noise due to the intrinsic shapes of galaxies and the contribution from distant large scale structure .",
    "a typical realisation is presented in figure  [ simnfw]a .",
    "the points indicate the simulated measurements , and the error bars reflect only the statistical error ( the intrinsic shapes of the sources ) .",
    "the input nfw signal is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the actual lensing signal , which is modified because of the large scale structure , is given by the solid line    figure  [ simnfw]b shows the difference between the `` observed '' signal and the input nfw profile .",
    "the large scale structure introduces significant deviations , which , in this particular case , systematically lower the signal on scales larger than 10 arcminutes .",
    "the input profile has @xmath109 and @xmath110 . the best fit nfw profile to the profile with the contribution from large scale structure only ( i.e. , no statistical noise from the shapes of the sources ) yields @xmath111 and @xmath112 when fitted out to 15 arcminutes",
    "when the profile is fitted out to 30 arcminutes , we obtain @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "hence , the large scale structure alters the inferred profile of an individual cluster , and the inferred values depend on the range in radius included in the fit .",
    "note , however , that the ensemble average value is not changed when a large sample of clusters is used .",
    "we now quantify the contribution of distant large scale structure to the total error budget .",
    "we start by considering clusters at a redshift @xmath3 , and masses @xmath115 .",
    "we assume that , because of substructure in the cluster core and contamination by cluster members , the nfw profile is fitted at radii larger than 30 arcseconds .",
    "the inclusion of measurements at smaller radii does not change the results significantly , because of the large statistical error on small scales .",
    "figure  [ noise_nfw ] shows how the @xmath116 uncertainty in the determination of @xmath0 ( upper panels ) and @xmath1 ( lower panels ) varies with increasing @xmath117 , the outermost point included in the fit .",
    "the uncertainties are determined from 1000 realisations .",
    "the dotted lines corresponds to the contribution from the intrinsic ellipticities of the background galaxies .",
    "the statistical uncertainty decreases when the lensing signal is measured out to larger distances from the cluster centre .",
    "the dashed lines denotes the contribution from the large scale structure .",
    "the combined uncertainty is indicated by the solid lines .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ noise_nfw ] demonstrate that contribution of distant large scale strucure to the total error budget can not be neglected .",
    "this is true , even for clusters as massive as @xmath118 .",
    "the accuracy in the measurement of @xmath1 improves with increasing mass of the cluster , whereas the uncertainty in @xmath0 increases ( although the relative accuracy does improve ) .",
    "the real uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are typically a factor @xmath5 larger than expected from the statistical noise caused by the intrinsic shapes of the sources alone .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of the parameter estimation does not improve by fitting the model to radii larger than @xmath119 arcminutes .",
    "it is also interesting to examine how well we constrain @xmath0 and @xmath1 for clusters at various redshifts .",
    "for instance , hoekstra ( 2001 ) showed that large scale structure seriously limits the accuracy of mass determinations for low redshift clusters . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the accuracy is limited by the intrinsic shapes of the sources .",
    "we consider a cluster with @xmath120 at redshifts ranging from 0.05 to 0.7 .",
    "figure  [ noise_nfw ] shows that the most accurate results are obtained for @xmath121 , and we use this value to fit the profiles .",
    "the @xmath116 uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of redshift are presented in figure  [ noise_z ] .",
    "the results show that the optimal redshift for the determination of @xmath0 is @xmath122 , although for the adopted limiting magnitude of @xmath123 , the uncertainty does not increase dramatically for higher redshift clusters .",
    "this is because for a fixed angular scale , one probes larger physical scales at high redshift , which explains why the contribution from the intrinsic shapes is almost constant , and the noise from large scale structure increases .",
    "the noise , however , increases rapidly for low redshift clusters .",
    "the situation is different for the measurement of the concentration parameter @xmath1 , which is presented in figure  [ noise_z]b .",
    "the error increases significantly for high redshift clusters , and the most accurate measurements are obtained for clusters with redshifts @xmath124",
    ".    therefore studies of intermediate redshift clusters are best suited to test the predictions of dissipationless collapse .",
    "in addition these systems can be studied efficiently using x - ray telescopes and new multi - object spectrographs ( such as imacs ) .",
    "comparison of the results obtained through these various techniques can provide also new insights in the dynamics of structure formations",
    "the comparison of measured mass profiles of cluster of galaxies with the outcome of numerical simulations provides an important test of our current understanding of structure formation .",
    "although mass profiles can be inferred through various techniques , weak lensing is of particular interest , because it probes the ( dark ) matter distribution directly .",
    "it does not rely on assumptions about the dynamical state of the cluster or the nature of dark matter .",
    "in addition it does not require a visible tracer , which is important to study the mass profile at large distances from the cluster centre .",
    "unfortunately , a simple interpretation of the lensing signal is complicated because of the contribution of large scale structure along the line of sight . to date",
    ", weak lensing studies of clusters of galaxies have ignored the effect of distant large scale structure .",
    "the effect on mass estimates was studied previously by hoekstra ( 2001 ) . in this paper",
    "we followed the approach of hoekstra ( 2001 ) to quantify the effect of distant large scale structure on the mass profile inferred from weak lensing .",
    "we considered nfw profiles , which provide a good description of the outcome of simulations with collisionless dark matter .",

    "for a cluster at @xmath3 , optimal results are obtained when the lensing signal is measured out to @xmath4 arcminutes .",
    "measurements at larger radii do not improve the accuracy .",
    "this is different from the situation where the contribution from large scale structure is ignored : the measurement error decreases when the signal is measured out to larger radii .",
