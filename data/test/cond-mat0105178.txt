    "if the isospin interaction is spherically symmetric then the total symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) is @xmath12 . at the point @xmath13 the hamiltonian has even higher @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "investigation of the model at this point has attracted great interest @xcite . in the one - dimensional case",
    "there is an exact solution for the ground state and for several types of excitations @xcite .",
    "for the two - dimensional case ( square lattice ) an exact solution is not known .",

    "it was pointed out in ref . @xcite",
    "that at @xmath13 the ising part of the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) is equivalent to the 4-state potts model @xcite .",
    "this model has classical macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state , and this is another indication in favor of the disordered ground state of the spin - orbital model at the @xmath0 point . as a possible ground state",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested a liquid of plaquette @xmath0 singlets .",
    "this ground state is a @xmath0 singlet , but it has spontaneous breaking of the translational lattice symmetry .",
    "further analytical and numerical work supports this scenario @xcite .",
    "the present work has the following goals : to investigate the spin - orbital model on the square lattice , away from the @xmath13 point and to identify all the quantum transitions , and also to investigate the model away from the isotropic @xmath12 line .",
    "we also present new evidence in favor of the anisotropic plaquette spin - orbital liquid in the vicinity of the @xmath0 point .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we start from the limit @xmath15 and then approach smaller values of @xmath9 , using both spin - wave and perturbation methods . in section iii",
    "we consider the opposite limit , of strong quartic interaction : @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the spin - wave theory is not valid and the only tool is a modified series expansion .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in the limit @xmath18 the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) describes two almost independent heisenberg subsystems .",
    "both of them are ordered antiferromagnetically , and so the @xmath12 symmetry is spontaneously broken",
    ". therefore there are two goldstone excitations , spin - wave ( @xmath19- wave ) and isospin - wave ( @xmath20- wave ) , that determine the low energy physics of the model .",
    "the ground state is a direct product of the nel - ordered spin subsystem and of the nel - ordered isospin subsystem , with two sublattices in each subsystem . in each sublattice",
    "we introduce a dyson - maleev transformation of spin and isospin operators @xcite . for the a sublattice , @xmath21 and for the b sublattice , @xmath22 we are interested in @xmath23 , but for now we keep them as parameters . after the transformation the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] )",
    "takes the following form    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath26 is the number of nearest neighbors . in eq .",
    "( [ tr_hamilton ] ) the part containing only the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 describes the spin subsystem with a renormalized exchange constant , @xmath29 , while the part containing only the @xmath30 and @xmath2 operators describes the isospin subsystem with similar renormalization , @xmath31 .",
    "the other terms describe the interaction between the subsystems .    in the linear spin wave approximation",
    "we neglect all quartic terms in the hamiltonian ( [ tr_hamilton ] ) .",
    "after this the standard @xcite bogoliubov transformation diagonalization gives the dispersion relation for @xmath19- and @xmath20-waves : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "the staggered magnetization in this approximation is independent of @xmath35 , and is @xmath36 one can also easily take into account single loop corrections to the linear spin wave approximation . to do this , following the usual procedure @xcite , we make all possible decouplings in the quartic terms in the hamiltonian ( [ tr_hamilton ] ) .",
    "this gives the following effective hamiltonian @xmath37 here we use the notations : @xmath38 the value of @xmath39 can be calculated in the linear spin - wave approximation or it can be found self - consistently .",
    "both values are very close . for further analysis",
    "we take the self - consistent value : @xmath40 .",
    "the excitation spectra for @xmath19- and @xmath20-waves are then @xmath41 the difference from the linear spin - wave approximation is only in the renormalized values of @xmath42 .",
    "the staggered magnetization is exactly the same as that in the linear spin wave approximation , see eq .",
    "( [ sztz ] ) .",
    "the values of the effective exchange constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 vanish at some critical value of the bare exchange constant @xmath9 .",
    "one finds from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_exchanges ] ) that at @xmath23 the critical value is @xmath45 the staggered magnetization given by eqs .",
    "( [ sztz ] ) remains constant on approaching this point , and therefore the quantum phase transition at @xmath46 is of first - order .    in the above analysis we have taken into account explicitly only the @xmath19- and @xmath20-waves .",
    "however along with these two excitations there are also the so called spin - isospin excitations ( @xmath47-wave ) carrying simultaneous spin and isospin flips . in the spin - wave approach the @xmath47-excitations",
    "are not treated explicitly .",
    "they appear in the calculation via the quartic interaction term in the hamiltonian ( [ tr_hamilton ] ) that we treat in the one - loop approximation .",
    "however as one approaches the transition point this interaction becomes more important and our way of treating it is questionable .",
    "moreover , it is known that in the 1d model at @xmath13 for @xmath23 the @xmath19- @xmath20- and @xmath47-excitations are almost degenerate at @xmath48 , see ref .",
    "this raises further questions about the validity of our implicit treatment of the @xmath47-excitation . in the remainder of this section",
    "we treat the @xmath47 excitations explicitly .",
    "the spin - wave approach is not convenient for the explicit consideration of the @xmath47-excitation . to address this problem we use a kind of series expansion method .",
    "one takes the ising part of the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) as a zeroth - order approximation and the transverse terms are treated as perturbations proportional to the introduced small parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "so we represent the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) in the following form @xmath51 the properties of the initial spherically symmetric hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) are recovered in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "the effect of the @xmath53 perturbation @xmath54 alone leads to the the same reduction of the staggered magnetization as in the pure heisenberg model .",
    "the average spin is reduced from 1/2 to @xmath55 the numerical value corresponds to @xmath56 , see ref .",
    "the antiferomagnetically ordered isospin subsystem background results only in a renormalization of exchange constant @xmath57 .",
    "however it does not effect the magnetization as it does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "the same effect occurs with @xmath58 acting alone on the isospin subsystem .",
    "an additional reduction of the staggered magnetization appears due to the simultaneous action of @xmath53 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 channel ) .",
    "for example first @xmath53 flips the spins at nearest sites and then @xmath58 flips the isospins at the same sites .",
    "so a virtual fluctuation with @xmath47-flips at neighboring sites is created .",
    "after that the fluctuation can collapse back to the ising ground state using the same chain of spin and isospin flips .",
    "thus the effect of the staggered magnetization reduction arises in 4th order of perturbation theory and hence it is proportional to @xmath60 . near the critical value @xmath61",
    ", this reduction is so small that there is no point to calculate it more accurately .",
    "a more important effect arises from the @xmath62 term ( @xmath47-channel ) in the hamiltonian ( [ series_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this perturbation creates , in first order , a pair of @xmath47-flips at the neighboring sites .",
    "the matrix element of the perturbation is @xmath63 , and the energy of the virtual excitation is @xmath64 .",
    "hence the reduction of the staggered magnetization due to this mechanism is @xmath65 at the critical value @xmath66 and at @xmath67 this gives @xmath68 .",
    "this is the additional reduction of the value presented in eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) .",
    "we see that the effect of @xmath47-excitations is not completely negligible , but it is not qualitatively important : the staggered magnetization remains finite at the critical point .",
    "this supports our conclusion that the phase transition from the nel@xmath69nel state at @xmath70 to some other state at @xmath71 is of first order . unfortunately because of the first - order phase transition this analysis does not give any insight into the structure of the ground state at @xmath71 .",
    "a different approach is needed for consideration of the strong quartic interaction limit .",
    "we will see that in the limit @xmath16 the @xmath47-excitations are crucially important .",
    "this makes this regime qualitatively different from that considered in the previous section , and this is why the spin - wave approach is not helpful at @xmath16 .",
    "we base our analysis on series expansions using a representation of the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) in the form ( [ series_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "there are two immediately obvious possibilities for the ground state of the system at small @xmath9 : a ) the nel@xmath69ferromagnetic state ( n@xmath69f ) , where one subsystem has nel ordering and the other is ordered ferromagnetically , b ) the stripe@xmath69stripe state ( s@xmath69s ) , where one subsystem has collinear magnetic order along one crystal axis and the other subsystem has collinear magnetic order in the perpendicular direction , see fig.1 .",
    "the n@xmath69f ground state spontaneously violates the @xmath12 symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ model_hamilton ] ) .",
    "the s@xmath69s state in addition violates the @xmath73 group of the square lattice , so the total spontaneously broken symmetry in this case is @xmath74 .",
    "now let us look at the hamiltonian ( [ series_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "one can easily show that in the ising limit ( i.e. at @xmath75 ) the n@xmath69f and s@xmath69s states have the same energy .",
    "moreover there is an infinite set of other degenerate states because a simultaneous spin - isospin flip on any lattice site ( @xmath47- wave ) does not cost any energy ( we consider the @xmath23 case ) .",
    "so in the ising approximation there is an infinite macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "what we want to demonstrate first is that the quantum fluctuations stabilize the s@xmath69s state .",
    "let us consider the simpleast quantum fluctuations : spin or isospin flips at nearest sites , @xmath19- and @xmath20-waves .",
    "these fluctuations are generated by @xmath53 and @xmath58 correspondingly , see eq .",
    "( [ series_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "a straightforward second - order perturbation theory calculation gives @xmath76 thus the @xmath77 state has lower energy than the @xmath78 state for @xmath79 .",
    "so , in the following , we consider only the @xmath77 state .",
    "however eq . ( [ nfss ] ) does not answer the question posed above : what is the excitation energy of the @xmath47-wave above the @xmath77 background ?",
    "if it is still zero then the background is unstable .",
    "analysis of the second - order perturbation theory result shows that the @xmath47-excitation blocks some @xmath19- and @xmath20-fluctuations , and hence the @xmath47-excitation energy is nonzero .",
    "a calculation gives the following value of the @xmath47-gap @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the energy of the @xmath77-background with one @xmath47-excitation . in this order of perturbation theory",
    "the @xmath47-excitation is dispersionless .",
    "the gap @xmath82 vanishes at @xmath83 and @xmath13 .",
    "however the gap is positive in the interval @xmath84 and hence the quantum fluctuations do , in fact , stabilize the @xmath77-state .",
    "one can also calculate the dispersion relations of @xmath19- and @xmath20-waves . to first - order in @xmath53 and @xmath58 the results",
    "are @xmath85 we see that these energies are substantially higher than @xmath82 . therefore below we concentrate on the @xmath47-waves that drive all the critical dynamics in the system .",
    "the excitation energy of two remote @xmath47-waves is @xmath86 .",
    "however if two @xmath47-waves are localized at the nearest diagonal sites of the lattice then supression of quantum fluctuations is reduced and a direct calculation shows that the energy of such a configuration is just @xmath82 .",
    "this means that two @xmath47-waves attract each other and the binding energy is @xmath87 .",
    "we would like to stress that this is not an effect of a simple potential attraction , this is the effect of a quantum bag : supression of quantum fluctuations .",
    "we have found that there is a quantum bag attraction between the @xmath47-waves . in this situation",
    "it is quite natural to put more @xmath47-waves in the bag .",
    "three excitations do not fit naturally into the square lattice , and therefore we consider four @xmath47-excitations combined into a plaquette bag as shown in fig.2 .",
    "this is the _ plaquette _ excitation .",
    "the corresponding excitation energy , the _ plaquette _ gap @xmath88 , is equal to @xmath89 the value of @xmath88 versus @xmath90 is plotted in fig.3 , as the solid line . for comparison in the same figure we plot the value of @xmath82 given by eq .",
    "( [ deffectenergy ] ) .",
    "the gap @xmath88 vanishes at @xmath91 and in the interval @xmath92 it is negative .",
    "this means that in this interval the @xmath77-state is unstable with respect to condensation of plaquette excitations . in the phase diagram shown in fig.4 this region",
    "is separated from that with smaller values of @xmath9 by the vertical dashed line @xmath93 .",
    "naively one would say that a crossing of this line corresponds to a second - order phase transition from the @xmath77-state to a state with the plaquette order considered in refs .",
    "however , one needs to examine this more carefully . as we mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath77-state violates the @xmath74 symmetry of the hamiltonian . on the other hand the plaquette state at @xmath13 considered in refs .",
    "@xcite violates only @xmath94-symmetry ( plaquette state has 2-fold degeneracy in @xmath49-direction and 2-fold degeneracy in @xmath50-direction ) .",
    "as we have demonstrated above , the @xmath94 order parameter appears in the second order phase transition at @xmath93 .",
    "however the question arises : how do the @xmath12 and @xmath73 order parameters disappear when going from small @xmath9 to @xmath13 . to confirm this scenario @xcite we have to find two additional quantum phase transitions : 1 ) disappearence of @xmath12 order parameters , 2 ) restoration of @xmath73 order .",
    "the @xmath12 order parameter is the usual staggered magnetization .",
    "so let us calculate reduction of the staggered magnetization .",
    "there are four types of relevant quantum fluctuations that reduce the magnetization a ) spin flips at nearest sites , i.e. a virtual creation of two @xmath19-waves , b ) isospin flips at nearest sites , i.e. a virtual creation of two @xmath20-waves , c ) simultaneous spin and isospin flips at nearest sites , i.e. a virtual creation of two @xmath47-waves , d ) similtaneous spin and isospin flips at four plaquette sites , i.e. a virtual creation of a _ plaquette _ excitation .",
    "we can not use a conventional perturbation expansion approach because , in the ising approximation , the excitation energies @xmath82 and @xmath88 vanish , see eqs .",
    "( [ deffectenergy ] ) and ( [ plaquettetenergy ] ) .",

    "( [ deffectenergy]),([plaquettetenergy ] ) are the excitation energies corresponding to the fluctuations a , c , and d. the matrix elements @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 are the amplitudes of creation of these fluctuations from the ising ground state",
    ". the fluctuation b ( isospin flips at nearest sites ) does not contribute to the reduction of @xmath101 .",
    "the coefficients 2 , 4 , and 4 in eq .",
    "( [ sztd ] ) give the number of possibilities for a given virtual excitation to contribute to the reduction of @xmath101 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath98 arises in the first order of perturbation theory in @xmath53 , the amplitudes @xmath102 and @xmath100 arise in the second order in @xmath62 or in the combined fourth order of @xmath53 and @xmath58 .",

    "( [ sztd ] ) allows us to find the reduction of the staggered magnetization . in the final analysis we set @xmath79 . at any given value of @xmath9",
    "the magnetization vanishes at some particular @xmath49 .",
    "this is the location of the second - order phase transition from the magnetically ordered phase to the spin - orbital liquid . in the phase diagram shown in fig.4",
    "the solid line separates these two states .",
    "thus we have found the transition from the magnetically ordered @xmath104-state to the spin - orbital liquid .",
    "however we do not see any mechanism for restoration of the @xmath73-symmetry violated in the @xmath77-state .",
    "these considerations lead us to the following phase diagram , see fig.4 .",

    "the phase ( ii ) is the spin - orbital liquid .",
    "it has no magnetization , but still must violate the @xmath73-symmetry .",

    "@xcite certainly we can not claim that the state ( ii ) is a kind of dimer quantum liquid , but its symmetry is the same .",
    "finally , the state ( iii ) on the right hand side of the dashed line is a plaquette spin - orbital liquid because of the condensation of the plaquette excitations at @xmath93 .",
    "however it is not an isotropic plaquette liquid considered in refs .",
