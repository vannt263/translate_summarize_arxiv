    "while most observed protoplanetary discs display accretion rates of order @xmath6  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  @xcite , some objects , in particular fu orionis systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have exhibited episodes of enhanced accretion up to @xmath9  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  @xcite over observed time - scales of 10 - 100  years .",
    "it has been hypothesised that _ all _ protostellar systems actually undergo such episodic accretion , equating to a small fraction ( the `` duty cycle '' ) of their total lifetime , possibly concentrated in their early stages @xcite .",
    "indeed this would alleviate the apparent discrepancy between the low observed accretion rates and that required to achieve the final mass of the protostars @xcite .",
    "although the mechanism underlying fu orionis outbursts has not been established to date @xcite , a presently popular class of model uses as its only ingredients the two currently favoured drivers of transport in protoplanetary disks , namely the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) and the gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "the `` gravo - magnetic cycle '' , as it has come to be called @xcite , relies on the fact that a disc with a `` normal '' density is typically too cold ( @xmath10  k ) and too dense for its mid - plane to be sufficiently ionised to trigger the mri , giving rise to a _",
    "dead zone_. as the disc is gravitationally stable at such densities , accretion will only be possible in the surface layers where x - ray / uv ( or cosmic ray ) ionisation keeps the mri alive @xcite .",
    "however , a steady - state situation can not be achieved and mass accumulates in the dead zone , until gravitational instability sets in , raising the disc s mid - plane temperature ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "near @xmath12  k , thermal ionisation triggers the mri throughout the entire thickness of the disc , resulting in an accretion burst which lasts @xmath13  years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once the previously accumulated mass is dumped on the proto - star , the disc returns to the initial `` low state '' ( or quiescent state ) .",
    "the cycle may then resume , with a duty cycle @xmath14  % at low infall rates ( @xmath15  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  ) up to @xmath16 at high infall rates ( @xmath17  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  ) .",
    "the significant changes in the disc s temperature and luminosity during such an accretion burst can chemically process a large fraction of the disc material .",
    "several previous studies have shown the impact of accretion bursts on the chemical evolution of the envelope and disc .",
    "@xcite studied the impact of accretion busts on the co chemistry in the envelopes , in particular the large increase in luminosity , and found that repeated bursts could lead to repeated freeze - out cycles .",
    "these evolutionary co cycles lead to possible observational evidence of accretion outbursts in young star forming cores @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite used ` single - point ' models to study the impact of accretion bursts on the local evolution of various chemical species in the envelope , indicating that the outcome depends delicately on the balance between burst and chemical time - scales .",
    "however , what has not been considered in great detail is that this processed material can then be transported to smaller radii in the disc by advection and to larger ones by turbulent diffusion . these effects , which may persist for significantly longer than the duration of the bursts , may lend themselves to observable diagnostics ; whether for extrasolar systems , e.g. with the increased resolution and sensitivity offered by _ alma _ and _ herschel _ , or our own solar system , taking advantage of the rich body of cosmochemical evidence . to this end , in this series we set out to investigate the chemical consequences of accretion bursts .",
    "an astrochemically abundant species of choice in this regard is water @xcite , and in particular its d / h  ratio @xcite .",
    "observations of the interstellar medium and pre - stellar cores suggest that water starts deuterium - rich ( d / h@xmath18 ; @xcite ) . yet",
    "bulk chondrites and comets ( with a further _ in situ _ measurement to come for comet churyumov - gerasimenko @xcite ) in our solar system display lower ( d / h)@xmath0 ratios ( around @xmath19 ) , although some micron - scale d - rich hotspots in clays of the semarkona chondrite do reach ( d / h)@xmath0 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this in turn is much higher than the protosolar value ( essentially that of molecular hydrogen ) of @xmath3 @xcite , and reaction kinetics prohibit the conversion of low ( d / h)@xmath0 ratios to higher values in the protoplanetary disc @xcite .",
    "the current interpretation is that the solar system inherited its water from the parent molecular cloud @xcite , and that this water _ partially _ exchanged its deuterium with the nebular gas @xcite .",
    "coupling this deuterium exchange with mixing throughout the disc produced the range of intermediate ( d / h)@xmath0 values we now observe @xcite .",
    "the bottom line is that the ( d / h )  ratio of water is a sensitive tracer of infall , temperature and turbulent mixing conditions .",
    "all previous studies of the ( d / h)@xmath0  ratio assumed a constant turbulence level ( often parametrised in terms of the shakura & sunyaev @xmath21 , @xcite ) , and thus could not reproduce the gravo - magnetic cycle , and had no accretion outbursts .",
    "additionally , only @xcite considered the effects of infall , during which most of the outbursts are expected to take place @xcite , along with the subsequent disc evolution .",
    "@xcite presented steady - state analytical calculations , indicating that in such types of model , a high efficiency of turbulent diffusion - with a schmidt number @xmath22 of 0.2 or smaller - until the snow line and beyond would be required to account for the smallness of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio of carbonaceous chondrites and the earth relative to oort cloud comets ; but as yet the realism of such a small schmidt number is unclear @xcite .",
    "however , as isotopic exchange is most efficient for temperatures above @xmath23  k , clearly , outbursts , which may reach temperatures in excess of 1000 k , could significantly impact the ( d / h)@xmath0 profile of protoplanetary disc and possibly account for the low ( d / h)@xmath0 ratios of carbonaceous chondrites .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the effect of accretion outbursts arising from the gravo - magnetic limit cycle on the evolution of the ( d / h )  ratio of water using numerical models presented in section [ sec:1dmodel ] .",
    "since this process has not been studied before , to gain insight we perform numerical experiments where the disc experiences a steady infall rate for the entire simulation ( section [ sec : steady ] ) . secondly , we perform more realistic evolutionary calculations which include a disc building phase for a few hundred - thousand years followed by a stage of isolated evolution for several million years , that are meant to represent the evolution of an actual protoplanetary disc , e.g. the solar nebula ( section [ sec : building ] ) .",
    "the implications are then discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] and the conclusions summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of accretion bursts on the chemical evolution of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio we adopt a simple one - layer approach @xcite . our model is a modified version of that originally presented by @xcite to study the impact of dead - zones in protoplanetary discs and associated accretion bursts , where we additionally include radial transport of heat by radiation and turbulence ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here we extend the model to include the transport of water due to advection and turbulent diffusion as well as the chemical evolution of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio .",
    "the evolution of the surface density @xmath24 for a disc around a forming star , with a dead - zone is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the evolution of the temperature at the mid - plane of the disc is given by @xcite : @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\&&-\\left(\\frac{2h}{\\sigma^g rc_p}\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(rf_r\\right)\\label{eqn : temp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the heat capacity at constant pressure , @xmath36 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath37 is the scale height of the disc , with @xmath38 the keplerian angular velocity and @xmath39 the isothermal sound speed .",
    "@xmath40 is the ` potential temperature ' of the disc s mid - plane and following @xcite we define it as : @xmath41 noting that equation  [ eqn : temp ] is independent of the choice of scaling for the potential temperature.the net heating rate ( @xmath42 ) is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath45 is the vertical optical depth , with @xmath46 the opacity .",
    "the two fluxes @xmath47 & @xmath48 are the radial heat fluxes due to turbulence and radiation respectively ; which are given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the prandtl number ( in most calculations we take @xmath51 , the preferred value suggested by @xcite ) , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 the radiation constant , @xmath54 the speed of light and @xmath55 the mid - plane density . for our model",
    "we adopt the @xcite opacities and equation  [ eqn : temp ] is integrated as described in @xcite .",
    "our heating term ( equation  [ eqn : gamma ] ) does not account for stellar irradiation , which is known to dominate the heating in the outer disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we do not allow the disc s temperature to drop below what would be obtained for a passively heated disc given by : @xmath56 we set @xmath57 to : @xmath58^{1/4}\\ ] ] where the mass scaling is identical to that adopted by @xcite , based on a fit to a t tauri star s birth - line from @xcite .",
    "finally , the temperature is also restricted to be no less than 10  k at very large radius , to account for heating from the surrounding star - forming region . in all calculations",
    "we assume an ideal equation of state with @xmath59 and a mean molecular weight ( @xmath60 ) of 2.35 amu as the majority of the disc material we are interested in remains molecular and neutral .",
    "we treat the viscosity using an ` alpha ' model such that : @xmath61 for mri turbulence we set @xmath62 and for angular momentum transport due to self - gravity we set @xmath63 to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the toomre parameter @xcite given by : @xmath66 the form of @xmath67 is not important and is merely designed to keep @xmath68 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as suggested by simulations of self - gravitating discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we treat the water component of the disc as a passive scalar species , such that it is advected along with the gas and can diffuse with respect to the gas due to turbulence .",
    "thus , the evolution of the water component is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath69+\\dot{\\sigma_i}\\label{eqn : s_water}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we evolve equation  [ eqn : s_water ] for the two water species h@xmath70o and hdo .",
    "@xmath71 represents both infall onto the disc and the chemical evolution of the two species .",
    "since the purpose of this work is to understand whether accretion bursts affect the evolution of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio rather than make detailed predictions , we do not attempt to model a full chemical network but adopt the simple model proposed by @xcite based on @xcite , where the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio in water evolves as : @xmath72\\label{eqn : water_chem}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the gas number density at the disc s mid - plane , @xmath74 is the rate constant for the deuteration of water given by @xcite @xmath75 \\ ] ] and ( d / h)@xmath76 is the equilibrium d / h ratio at a given temperature , which we take from @xcite assuming the d / h ratio in the background molecular hydrogen dominated disc is @xmath77 .",
    "the latter values were found by @xcite to agree reasonably well with the values obtained from their more detailed chemical network . in all calculations we assume , like @xcite , that the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio of the in - falling primordial water is @xmath78 .",
    "the infall profile adopted depends on the evolutionary model ( steady infall vs. disc building calculations ) . for the steady infall problem",
    "we use a gaussian infall profile which peaks at a radius @xmath79 and has standard deviation @xmath80 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the full evolutionary calculations , where we account for disc building from a uniformly rotating collapsing core , we follow @xcite and adopt the @xcite infall profile : @xmath81,\\ ] ] where the instantaneous centrifugal radius ( @xmath82 ) of the infalling material is given by angular momentum balance : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the core s rotation rate ( considered to be constant in space and time ) , @xmath85 is the temperature of the core and @xmath86 is the mass of the star & disc .",
    "finally , we assume the core follows an isothermal inside - out collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and use a constant infall rate of @xmath87 until the core mass is fully depleted , where @xmath88 is the sound speed for gas at a temperature of @xmath89 in all calculations ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "our numerical code is based on the method detailed in @xcite where advective fluxes are reconstructed using a second order method and a van - leer limiter .",
    "equations  [ eqn : temp ] & [ eqn : gas ] are integrated explicitly using a scheme that is second order in space and first order in time using a staggered mesh and finite volume operators . in order to evolve the transport and chemistry of the water content",
    "we make use of operator splitting : first , equation  [ eqn : s_water ] without the chemical evolution terms is integrated explicitly using a scheme that is second order in space and first order in time .",
    "secondly the chemical evolution is evolved by integrating equation  [ eqn : water_chem ] using an implicit update , such that : @xmath90\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such a scheme is stable for equation that are both stiff and non - stiff over a simulation domain and thus appropriate for our problem .",
    "the simulations are initialised with the gas surface density set to the numerical floor of @xmath91 g  @xmath32 and the temperature set to 10  k. we use a non - uniform radial grid , using power - law spacing @xcite . at the inner boundary we use a zero - torque boundary condition for the gas surface density and a free outflow boundary for the water species . for our steady infall calculations",
    "we use 200 cells spaced between 0.1 and 66.8 au and at the outer boundary we use a zero - flux boundary condition for both the gas and water species .",
    "whereas for the disc building calculations we use 400 cells spaced between 0.047  au and 6685  au , at the outer boundary we use a zero shear boundary condition for the gas and a free - outflow boundary condition for the water .    in appendix",
    "a , we benchmark our simplified scheme against the results of the more complicated chemical network used by @xcite and find very good agreement .",
    "therefore , our simple scheme is appropriate for analysing the impact of accretion bursts on the d / h ratio in water .",
    "in order to better understand the effects of accretion bursts we consider a setup with steady infall ; where the star s mass does not grow with time and is fixed to @xmath92  m@xmath7  .",
    "such calculations have been previously used to study the properties of the accretion bursts themselves @xcite as they reach a steadily repeating limit cycle .",
    "initially , only gas falls onto the disc and it reaches a steady - limit cycle after approximately 0.3 - 0.6  myr . after 1  myr",
    "we then allow both water and gas to fall onto the disc and evolve the calculation for a further 3  myr .",
    "we perform large sets of calculations , where in all sets we vary the infall rate from @xmath93 to @xmath94  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  and the infall radius from 0.32 to 32  au .",
    "we run one set of calculations with no dead - zone and thus no accretion bursts .",
    "additionally , we run five further sets which include accretion bursts : three have a prandtl number of 10 ( the theoretically preferred value of @xcite ) and vary the schmidt number taking @xmath95 , 1.0 & 3.0 ; finally we run two sets with a schmidt number of 1.0 but prandtl numbers of 1 & 100 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : dh_profile1 ] , we show the radial distribution of the d / h ratio in water 0.5 myr after the water has been introduced into the disc ( we plot the profile during quiescence as the d / h ratio shows a transient during the burst ) for a simulation with @xmath96  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  and @xmath97  au in the six sets of calculations .",

    "the thin solid line shows the result with no dead zone ( and therefore no accretion bursts ) .",
    "the thick lines show simulations with accretion bursts with schmidt numbers of ( 0.3 - dashed , 1.0 - solid & 3.0 - dot - dashed ) .",
    "the thin dotted lines represent calculations with accretion bursts and a schmidt number of 1.0 but prandtl numbers of 1.0 ( black ) & 100.0 ( grey ) . ]",
    "these profiles clearly show that accretion bursts have a strong impact on the d / h ratio distribution . with accretion",
    "bursts the radius at which the d / h ratio reaches the fully equilibrated value of @xmath98 ( the `` equilibration radius '' ; where the equilibration time - scale is comparable to the transport time - scale c.f .",
    "@xcite ) increases from roughly 1  au to 3  au .",
    "additionally , it decreases the d / h ratio at large radius in the disc from the unprocessed value ( @xmath78 ) with no accretion bursts to @xmath99 with accretion bursts and a schmidt number of 0.3 .",
    "finally , we note that the value of the prandtl number makes little difference .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that while the prandtl number does affect the individual properties of an accretion burst ( e.g. duration ) it does not effect the duty - cycle of the burst significantly @xcite and hence the fraction of disc material processed by the accretion burst when averaged over a time - scale longer than the burst time - scale .    in figures  [ fig : space_time_nb ] & [ fig : space_time_b ] we show the space - time evolution of the temperature ( right - panel ) and ( d / h)@xmath0 ( middle - panel ) , along with the accretion rate evolution ( left - panel ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : space_time_nb ] shows that the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio quickly reaches a steady state distribution where the equilibration radius occurs at 1  au ( the temperature here is essentially due to viscous dissipation ) , in agreement with the analytic models of @xcite .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : space_time_b ] shows that , in the presence of accretion bursts , the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio never reaches a steady state ; but like the accretion rate reaches a steadily repeating pattern , where incoming material is accreted into the dead zone region with a ( d / h)@xmath0 @xmath100 , which is then equilibrated in the dead zone region when the disc goes through an accretion burst , which raises the temperature well above the equilibration temperature to @xmath101  k. thus , the dead zone is able to thermally process a larger fraction of the disc material , such that the equilibration radius is considerably further out than predicted by models that do not include accretion bursts . furthermore , as well as being carried by advection along with the gas , this newly equilibrated water in the dead zone region can diffuse out to large radius ( @xmath102  au ) in the disc lowering the ( time - independent ) ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio . in the case with accretion bursts ,",
    "this is more efficient than without because equilibration occurs at a larger radius .              in figures  [ fig : panel_nb ] and [ fig : panel_sc1 ]",
    "we show the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio measured at different locations in the disc after 0.5 myrs of evolution for the whole range of @xmath103 and @xmath79 examined .",
    "figure  [ fig : panel_nb ] shows the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio at 1.0 , 3.0 , 10 & 30 au for the simulation set with a schmidt number of 1.0 and no accretion bursts .",
    "this shows that at high accretion rates and small infall radii , most of the in - falling water is equilibrated before it can be transported to large radii resulting in a fully equilibrated disc . at low accretion rates",
    "@xmath104  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  the disc is too cold to equilibrate the water except at very small radii ( @xmath14  au ) and at intermediate values one gets a profile similar to that shown in figure  [ fig : dh_profile1 ] where the water is equilibrated inside some radius , the equilibration radius , which is an increasing function of mass accretion rate .",
    "essentially , the warmer the disc region onto which the infalling matter arrives , the more equilibrated the water of the disc as a whole will be .    the simulation set with accretion bursts and schmidt number of 1.0",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : panel_sc1 ] with the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio measured at 1.0 , 3.0 , 10.0 & 30.0 au after 0.5 myr of evolution .",
    "this shows a similar trend with infall rate and infall radius as previously ; however , with accretion bursts it is much more pronounced .",
    "similarly , the general trend of larger equilibration radius and lower ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio at large radius in the specific case discussed above holds for the majority of the parameter space . comparing these results with those found in figure  [ fig : panel_nb ] indicates that for the majority of the parameter space of interest the terrestrial region will have equilibrated water .",
    "however , in order for the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio to be reduced from primordial values at large radius requires infall rates @xmath105  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  , which is expected to occur at early times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the reduced ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio at large radius does appear to sensitively depend on the infall radius , with @xmath106  au resulting in fully equilibrated water at large radius : essentially all the incoming water is thermally processed in the dead - zone before it is transported to large radius .",
    "whereas with @xmath107  au the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio is only reduced from primordial values by a factor of @xmath108 , where the equilibrated water at large radius comes from the turbulent diffusion of material processed in the dead - zone that has then be transported to larger radius .",

    "we now consider calculations where we build the disc from a uniformly rotating core . initially the star has a mass of 0.2  m@xmath7  and the cloud core contains 0.8  m@xmath7  .",
    "the cloud core then falls onto the disc as described in section  [ sec : infall ] . any material that falls inside the inner boundary",
    "is automatically added to the star , whose mass is subject to an explicit update .",
    "since we have seen above that the prandtl number makes little difference to the results , we only perform calculations with @xmath51 . we then perform a series of simulations where we vary the cloud s rotation rate @xmath84 between @xmath109 & @xmath110  s@xmath8 , the schmidt number between 0.1 & 10 and whether or not the disc experiences accretion bursts .      in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_evolve ] , we show how the individual components ( star , cloud core & disc ) in our disc building calculations evolve during the simulation for a model with @xmath111  s@xmath8 .",

    "no accretion bursts the star rapidly approaches 1  m@xmath7  after infall ceases and the disc remains below 0.1  m@xmath7  for the majority of the evolution and steadily declines in a power - law fashion .",
    "however , in the case with accretion bursts , the dead zone traps material in the disc .",
    "this results in a more massive disc around 0.1 - 0.2  m@xmath7  for the majority of the evolution , which accretes material onto the star in rapid bursts .",
    "this evolution is similar to that found previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) where discs that contain dead zones are generally more massive ( and thus hotter ) than discs that do not .            in figures  [ fig : db_st_nb ] & [ fig : db_st_b ]",
    "we show the evolution of the accretion rate ( left panel ) , centrifugal radius and snow - line radius taken at @xmath112  k ( thick dashed line and thick solid line respectively in middle and right panels ) , ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio ( middle panel ) and disc temperature ( right panel ) as a function of time of the calculations shown in figure  [ fig : mass_evolve ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : db_st_nb ] shows the space - time evolution for a calculation with @xmath111  s@xmath8 and no accretion burst .",
    "the accretion rate evolution shows that once the infall onto the disc ceases the accretion rate drops dramatically ; this coincides with a large decrease in disc temperature , which then slowly declines with time .",
    "the middle panel shows that the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio has a plateau around 10  au and declines at both large and small radius .",
    "this evolutionary track was seen by @xcite and is also shown in our benchmark calculation discussed in the appendix . at large radius",
    "this disc is primarily composed of material that fell at small radius into the hot disc and then was transported to large radius by decretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the water that fell at early times into the hot inner disc was equilibrated and then transported to large radius resulting in a ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio close to the equilibrated value at large radius ( although this radius increases with time ) . at small radius",

    "however , we see that the presence of a dead - zone and accretion bursts dramatically changes the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio profile in the inner regions of the disc .",
    "we also see an individual accretion burst has a transient effect that lasts @xmath1130.5  myr .",
    "each accretion burst processes a large fraction of water in the disc , resulting in a lower peak ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio ( as also seen in the steady infall calculations ) and results in a equilibration radius that on average remains constant with time ( at @xmath114  au ) and does not move in with time like in the case without accretion bursts .",

    "in the cases with accretion bursts at all rotation rates we find that at radii of @xmath5  au the water is equilibrated , unlike the case without accretion burst where above the critical core rotation rate it returns to near primordial values . at large radii",
    "the trend seen from the steady infall calculations is also repeated here , where accretion bursts results in a lower ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio ; however , the effect is less pronounced .",
    "we note the variability seen in the 1.0 & 3.0 au is indicative of the variability in the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio with time , in the case with accretion bursts .",
    "ratio as a function of radius for calculations with @xmath120  s@xmath8 for schmidt numbers of 0.1 ( dashed ) , 1.0 ( solid ) & 10.0 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "the top panel shows calculations without accretion bursts the bottom panel shows calculations with accretion bursts . ]    finally , in figure  [ fig : profile_sc ] we show the impact of the schmidt number on the ( d / h)@xmath0 profile , where we plot our the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio as a function of radius in our calculations with @xmath121  s@xmath8 after 1  myr of evolution with schmidt numbers of 0.1 ( dashed ) , 1.0 ( solid ) & 10.0 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "the top panel shows the calculation without accretion bursts and the bottom panel shows the calculations with accretion bursts . at small schmidt numbers",
    "there is enhanced transport of equilibrated water to large radius resulting in a lower ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio at large radius ( as seen by @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , larger schmidt numbers result in sharper transitions from the equilibrated water to the primordial value outward as expected from the reduced efficiency of turbulent diffusion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our calculations have shown that the presence of dead zones in protoplanetary discs , which can give rise to accretion bursts have a significant impact on the evolution of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio in water .",
    "this is not surprising since the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio equilibrates at temperatures @xmath122  k @xcite which lies in - between the quiescent temperature of the dead - zone of @xmath123  k and the dead - zone temperature during an accretion burst of @xmath101  k. hence , un - equilibrated material that resides in the dead zone prior to an accretion burst is brought closer to equilibration by the higher disc temperatures .",
    "our calculations have shown that the cloud core s rotation rate plays a strong role in setting the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio at large radius in the disc .",
    "thus , given the several order of magnitude spread in observed core rotation rates , with typical values @xmath124",
    "s@xmath8 @xcite then one would expect to observe a large spread in the ( d / h)@xmath0 values measured at large radii in protoplanetary discs .",
    "therefore , herschel ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , alma or tmt measurements of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio would allow inferences about the initial angular momentum of the discs .",
    "additionally , if the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio could be spatially resolved then the properties of accretion bursts could be probed or spatial variations in the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio then the probe could be used to place constraints on the schmidt number , similar to the method detailed by @xcite for spatial variations at various molecular snow lines .",
    "furthermore , combined observations of the crystalline silicate fraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio would allow the outward transport of crystalline materials by decretion during disc building hypothesis ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to be tested . indeed discs with high crystallinity fractions at large radius should also possess lower ( d / h)@xmath0 ratios .",
    "thus , future observations of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio should be able to probe the angular momentum distribution of the disc during the its building and formation .",
    "additionally , spatially resolved observations of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio should be able to determine whether the majority of protoplanetary discs experienced accretion bursts during their early evolution .",
    "to first order , the d / h systematics in the solar system may be subsumed in two salient features @xcite :    * most oort cloud comets show ( d / h)@xmath0 values of @xmath125 ( with some comets showing lower values ) , lower than expected in molecular clouds .",
    "* carbonaceous chondrites display d / h ratios significantly lower than cometary ( around the terrestrial value @xmath126 ) .",
    "both domains of variation are significantly higher than the protosolar value ( @xmath3 ) and significantly lower than the value observed in molecular clouds ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "in our framework , fact ( i ) indicates that infall has occurred on relatively small radii to allow significant equilibration before outward transport , which , as mentioned in the previous subsection , would also account for the presence in comets of crystalline silicates , also deemed to have originated in the inner solar system @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "the relatively large d / h ratio of cometary water compared to the protosolar value suggests that equilibration has not been complete .",
    "judging from figure [ fig : dh_omega ] , that would at face value constrain the rotation rate to be within a factor of several of @xmath127  s@xmath8 ( with a factor of @xmath108 systematic difference between the outburst - free and outburst - laden cases ) .",
    "of course , the infall model is very idealized , so the situation may not be as fine - tuned as it may seem ( whether with or without outbursts , incidentally ) .",
    "it is also possible that comets , whose ( d / h)@xmath0 is somewhat variable , do not mark the _ peak _ ( d / h)@xmath0 value of the disc , and whatever that may be , this latter value may still be consistent with the lower end of those determined for prestellar cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of fact ( ii ) may be grasped from examination of figure  [ fig : dh_temp ] which plots ( d / h)@xmath0 against the disc temperature for various disc models , along with the aforementioned solar system data .",
    "the dashed line shows the curve for a simulation without outbursts @xmath128  s@xmath8 and a schmidt number of 1 , for which the maximum d / h ratio roughly matches that displayed by comets at large radii ( @xmath102  au ) .",
    "it is seen that at the snow line ( taken here to correspond to a temperature of 170 k ) , ( d / h)@xmath0 is not very different from this maximum value , that is , in this case diffusion of equilibrated water from the inner solar system is too inefficient to induce a substantial deviation .",
    "however , carbonaceous chondrites , which generally show ample evidence of aqueous alteration and therefore initial presence of ice , should have formed beyond the snow line , and yet their d / h ratio is much lower than this .",
    "this @xcite pointed out as a general problem of standard disc models with @xmath129 .",
    "however , @xcite noted that assuming a schmidt number of about 0.2 ( more efficient turbulent diffusion ) , would alleviate this discrepancy , as illustrated by their analytic profile ( in a quasi - static approximation ) plotted as a red dot - dashed line in the figure ( at higher temperatures ) there . ] . while non - mri and non - ideal turbulence may produce sc values @xmath14",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is unclear how realistic such low schmidt numbers are , and the required sc values could be yet lower if the d / h values displayed by carbonaceous chondrite clays were compromised by isotopic exchange with organic matter as suggested by @xcite .",
    "if we now allow for bursts , the situation changes : the solid blue line in figure  [ fig : dh_temp ] stands for a simulation with bursts ( @xmath130  s@xmath8 ) also matching the cometary ( d / h)@xmath0 value at large radii , but this time matching the chondritic value at the snow line , despite a schmidt number of 1 .",
    "this is because accretion bursts have been able to process water in the inner disc , affecting the snow line , but the ( d / h)@xmath0 value at large radii has not evolved in pace with it ( see also figure [ fig : pre_post ] ) .",
    "so this may be an alternative way to account for the low d / h ratios of carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "to summarize , in order to explain the distribution of ( d / h)@xmath0 ratios measured in carbonaceous chondrites and comets we need that either : ( i ) the turbulent transport occurs with a rather low schmidt number @xmath131 , and the disc did not experience accretion bursts @xcite ; or ( ii ) turbulent transport occurs with a nominal schmidt number of @xmath5 and the disc experiences several accretion bursts during the initial stages of its evolution .     ratio shown against temperature after 1  myr of evolution",
    "compared to several solar - system constrains : protosolar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , carbonaceous chondrites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the majority of oort cloud comets ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the snow - line at a temperature of @xmath132  k is marked with the thin vertical dotted line .",
    "the thick solid line shows a simulation with @xmath115 , accretion bursts and @xmath111  s@xmath8 .",
    "the thick dashed line shows a simulation with @xmath115 , no accretion bursts and @xmath128  s@xmath8 .",
    "the thick dot - dashed line corresponds to the best fit solution of @xcite with @xmath133 . ]",
    "while we have shown that accretion bursts can have a significant impact on the evolution of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio , our results can not be considered precise predictions .",
    "rather , our simple models have allowed us to explore a large parameter space .",
    "thus , we must discuss the impact our simplifications may have had on the evolution .",
    "in particular , we adopted a rather simple model for the chemical evolution of the water and integrated one rate equation instead of a large chemical network ; however , we have shown our method agrees well with the more detailed calculations of @xcite , although reactions not considered by the latter ( e.g. ion - neutral ) could be important @xcite .",
    "perhaps the biggest simplification is the use of a one - dimensional , one - layer model , where the evolution is controlled by the properties at the mid - plane of the disc .",
    "@xcite performed a series of simulations where they considered the impact of the vertical temperature structure on the evolution of the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio and found it to be negligible .",
    "however , this may not be true for the layered structure in the dead - zone where the active surface layers that contain little mass , have a temperature different from the more massive dead zone @xcite and there may be turbulent mixing between the active and dead layers , with the possibility that the dead zone itself contains residual levels of turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a 2d structure would be worth taking into account .",
    "we have also assumed throughout the paper that water was tightly coupled to the gas .",
    "however , this may not be true at large distances ( where water is solid ) and late stages of the disc s evolution , especially if water becomes incorporated in growing aggregates of mm to m size ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". it might be _ a priori _ expected that the effect will be to make outward transport of equilibrated water more difficult @xcite but simulations including gas - solid drift , accretion and fragmentation would be worthwhile to address the effect on the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio .    finally , since we have shown ( in agreement with @xcite ) that the radius and time at which infalling material reaches the disc plays an important role in the late time ( d / h)@xmath0 profile , then more realistic disc formation models should be considered that account for differential rotation and turbulence in the cloud core , as well as the two- ( and possibly three- ) dimensional nature of the infall onto the disc @xcite , along with the associated angular momentum mis - match that can occur between the keplerian disc rotation and the rotation rate of the infalling material .",
    "we have used a 1d model of a layered protoplanetary disc that undergoes accretion bursts due to the gravo - magnetic limit cycle ( a commonly invoked mechanism to explain fu orionis outbursts ) to study their impact on the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio .",
    "we have performed two types of calculations ; firstly , a set of calculations with a steady infall rate onto the disc where we vary the infall rate , infall radius , schmidt number , prandtl number and whether or not the disc contains a dead zone .",
    "secondly , we perform a series of calculation where we build the disc and star from a uniformly rotating isothermal cloud core , where we vary the rotation rate , schmidt number and whether the disc contains a dead zone . in all these calculations",
    "we find that accretion burst play a major role in equilibrating water with the surrounding hydrogen gas .",
    "thus , the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio carries an imprint of whether the disc experienced accretion bursts or not .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    1 .   during an accretion burst , water in the dead zone region",
    "is equilibrated , lowering its d / h ratio to @xmath98 , as the dead zone temperature reaches @xmath101  k during the accretion burst , higher than the equilibration temperature .",
    "discs that undergo accretion bursts have , in general , lower ( d / h)@xmath0 ratios as the burst thermally process a larger fraction of the disc material .",
    "equilibrated water from the accretion burst can be carried to large radius by diffusion resulting in lower d / h ratios at 10 - 100s of au .",
    "discs that undergo accretion bursts have larger equilibration radii ( 1 - 5  au ) compared to discs that do not experience accretion bursts . 4 .",
    "the rotation rate of the parent cloud core plays an important role in setting the large scale ( d / h)@xmath0 profile as suggested by @xcite , indicating there should be a significant variation in the d / h ratio in protoplanetary discs .",
    "agreement with the solar - system constraints requires , either : ( 1 ) the solar nebula experienced no accretion bursts and had a low schmidt number @xmath4 ; or ( 2 ) the solar nebula experienced accretion bursts and had a schmidt number close to `` nominal '' ( i.e. unity ) .",
    "given the important role of accretion bursts in the evolution of ( d / h)@xmath0 , we suggest more detailed modelling of their impact on the chemical and physical evolution of protoplanetary discs be performed .",
    "finally , coupling these models with future observations , the ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio and profile could be used as probe for the prevalence of accretion bursts in the earliest stages of protoplanetary disc evolution .",
    "we thank the referee for comments which improved the paper .",
    "we are grateful to phil armitage for useful discussions .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the sunnyvale cluster at cita , which is funded by the canada foundation for innovation .",
    "since we have adopted a simplified approach to the chemical evolution in view of the numerous chemical reactions that may govern evolution of the deuterium fraction in water , we need to test whether our method is appropriate for studying the effect of accretion bursts .",
    "therefore , we repeat the ` standard model ' of disc evolution calculation of @xcite who include a much more complete chemical network with 14 species and 48 reactions .",
    "the model parameters are described in table  3 of @xcite ( i.e. @xmath134  s@xmath8 , @xmath135  k & @xmath136 ) .",
    "however , we do not simplify our temperature solver and opacity structure to that used by @xcite , but rather use the more detailed method described in section  [ sec:1dmodel ] .",
    "the results of our calculation are shown every 0.05myr in the left hand panel of figure  [ fig : yang_bench ] and the results from the yang et al.s original calculation are shown in the right - hand panel at 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 & 1.0 myr .",
    "we see that the two evolutionary paths agree very well , particularly at late times ( which we are primarily interested in from the point of view of observables ) .",
    "this indicates that our simple method for calculating the evolution ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio produces results comparable with the more detailed chemical method used by @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since @xcite performed a detailed exploration of the different approaches for the chemical evolution and found they gave similar results .",
    "therefore , we are confident that our method is suitable for exploring the effect of accretion bursts on the d / h ratio in water .",
