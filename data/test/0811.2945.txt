    "[ exc1e2e](a ) .",
    "the antiferromagnetic coupling between the electron and the magnetic ion starts at smaller magnetic field as the magnetic ion is moved .",
    "this is different from the previous results for @xmath109 .",
    "the reason is as follows : for the quantum dot with a single electron , the electron tends to accommodate permanently the @xmath82-shell with @xmath110 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ exc1e2e](a ) ) in the ground state while the exchange parameter in the @xmath82 shell ( @xmath111 ) is found to be maximum right at the center of the quantum dot . moving the magnetic ion away from the center of the dot",

    "the story for @xmath88 electrons ( see fig .",
    "[ exc1e2e](b ) ) is now interesting since the two electrons accommodate the @xmath82 shell with spins antiparallel making the total spin of the electron zero in the ground state with almost unit probability .",
    "this leads to zero contribution to the first term written in the last line in [ [ e : secondquantized ] ] for diagonal elements .",
    "therefore , the main contribution ( even very small ) to the exchange energy is now expected to come from coupling with configurations where one of the electrons ( spin down ) stays in the @xmath82 level and the other occupies higher level ( see the schematic diagram in fig .  [ exc1e2e](b ) ) . in this diagram , the magnetic ion is assumed to be located at the center of the dot with spin down ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the coupling of the electron ( spin up ) in the @xmath82 orbital with an electron from either of the @xmath81 shell is zero .",
    "the only non - zero coupling is with an electron with the quantum numbers ( 1,0 ) of the @xmath112 shell ( as shown in the diagram and this quantum state would change if the ion is located away from the center of the dot ) with the amount of about @xmath113 .",
    "this picture remains valid until the magnetic field is high enough to excite one electron from the @xmath82 shell to a higher quantum state forming the ground state with two up spins antiferromagnetically coupling with the magnetic ion .",
    "for smaller coulomb interaction strength , the antiferromagnetic behavior occurs at larger magnetic field since the two electrons repel each other less and consequently they stay longer antiparallel in the @xmath82 shell .     calculated for a three - electron quantum dot with the magnetic ion ( white cross ) located at @xmath76 in ( a ) , ( b ) and @xmath114 in ( c ) when the coulomb strength @xmath69 in a magnetic field @xmath115 ( see ( a ) ) and @xmath116 ( see ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",

    "<S> the electron - electron correlations in a many - electron ( @xmath0 ) quantum dot confined by a parabolic potential is investigated in the presence of a single magnetic ion and a perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the energy spectrum and calculated the addition energy which exhibits cusps as function of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex properties of the many - particle wave function of the ground state are studied and for large magnetic fields are related to composite fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the impurity influences strongly the spin pair correlation function when the external field is large </S>",
    "<S> . in small applied magnetic field , the spin exchange energy together with the zeeman terms leads to a ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic(fm - afm ) transition . when the magnetic ion is shifted away from the center of the quantum dot a remarkable re - entrant afm - fm - afm transition </S>",
