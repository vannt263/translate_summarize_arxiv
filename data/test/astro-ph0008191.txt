    "m51 is probably among the most famous galaxies in the sky , instantly recognizable by its nearby companion ngc  5195 .",
    "also known as the `` whirlpool galaxy '' , it was one of the first galaxies in which spiral structure was discovered by lord rosse , and it provides a spectacular text - book example of a grand - design sbc type spiral seen nearly face - on .",
    "it has a very high optical surface brightness @xcite and is also a strong emitter of far - infrared radiation , indicating strong star formation activity in the spiral arms @xcite .",
    "deep images reveal faint outlying material embedding both m51 and ngc  5195 @xcite , providing clear evidence that the two galaxies are physically interacting .",
    "these characteristics , along with the relatively small distance ( @xmath6 mpc , feldmeier et al .",
    "1997 ) and the location far from the galactic plane ( @xmath7 ) make m51 an attractive target for studying its population of _ young massive star clusters _ ( ymcs )",
    ".    ymcs are abundant in interacting and merger galaxies like e.g. the `` antennae '' ngc  4038/4039 ( a list of galaxies with known ymc populations is given in larsen ( 1999b ) ) .",
    "however , they are also seen in more normal galaxies like e.g. the lmc @xcite and m33 @xcite . in a recent study of 21 nearby , non - interacting spiral galaxies ,",
    "larsen & richtler ( lr2000 ) found a strong correlation between the specific @xmath1-band luminosity  of ymcs in a galaxy and the area - normalized star formation rate . in this respect , m51 provides a highly interesting intermediate case of a clearly interacting galaxy that has still retained the characteristics of a normal spiral .",
    "this paper reports the results of a study of ymcs in m51 . in sect .",
    "[ sec : selection ] , ymcs are identified and photometry is obtained from ground - based @xmath0 ccd imaging .",
    "archive hst / wfpc2 images are then used to examine a few clusters in detail , including measurements of their sizes ( sect .",
    "[ sec : hst ] ) .",
    "next , the specific @xmath1-band luminosity of the m51 cluster system is derived and compared with other galaxies ( sect .",
    "[ sec : glob ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] the ymc population in m51 is compared with young clusters in the milky way and the lmc , along with some considerations on formation of ymcs .",
    "finally , conclusions are in sect .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "ccd images in the @xmath0 passbands were obtained on mar 13  14 , 2000 with the prime focus camera ( pfcam ) on the lick 3 meter shane telescope at mount hamilton , california .",
    "the total integration times were 3600 , 1200 and 900 sec . in @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , split into 3 individual exposures in each filter .",
    "typical seeing values ranged between 10 and 15 , but the image quality was degraded by problems with the alignment of the mirror cell after recent re - aluminization and oscillations due to wind , making stellar images appear somewhat elongated .",
    "the image scale was 0296 /pixel and the total field of view was @xmath10 , sufficient to fully cover both m51 itself and the companion ngc  5195 .    to reduce read - out time ,",
    "the two halves of the ccd were read out in parallel through two amplifiers . during the subsequent reductions ,",
    "the difference between the bias levels in the two parts of the ccd image was found to change by up to @xmath11 adu from one exposure to another .",
    "the difference was eliminated by adding a constant number to all pixel values in one half of the image .",
    "a more serious concern was that the flat - field varied significantly , most likely because of scattered light . dividing two skyflats in the same filter with each other",
    ", the ratio was found to vary by up to @xmath12 from the centre to the corner of the chip , with the most severe problems in the southern @xmath13 pixels ( about @xmath14 ) of the field . within the central @xmath15 pixels the variations were less dramatic , but still quite significant at about the 5% level .",
    "the effect was clearly visible in the final calibrated images as large - scale gradients in the background .",
    "however , the pattern appeared to be more or less the same in all passbands so the flatfielding errors may , to a certain extent , cancel out for colour indices ."
