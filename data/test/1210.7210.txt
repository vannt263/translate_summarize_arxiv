    "the lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is invariant under the transformations described by the chiral symmetry group @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of light - quark flavors @xcite . in vacuum and at low temperatures ,",

    "lattice - qcd computations have found that the quark condensate `` melts '' with increasing temperature  @xcite until its disappearance signals the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the gradual dissolution of the quark condensate is expected to be accompanied by an emerging degeneracy of chiral partner hadrons .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 masses , or more generally , the pertinent vector and axial - vector spectral functions , should approach each other with rising temperature and finally become degenerate when chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the interplay between the temperature dependence of spectral functions and condensates can be analyzed using finite - temperature sum rules .",
    "these relate integrals over spectral distributions to an operator product expansion ( ope ) which is expressed in terms of low - energy condensates .",
    "the most relevant sum rules for the present work are the qcd sum rules ( qcdsrs )  @xcite and the weinberg - type sum rules ( wsrs )  @xcite .",
    "the former are channel specific , i.e. , they differ for the vector and axial - vector channels , and they contain both chirally breaking and symmetric operators .",
    "the latter relate moments of the difference between the vector and axial - vector spectral functions to chiral order parameters .",
    "both sets of sum rules provide useful tools from which either the temperature dependence of the spectral functions can be constrained , or by which models of temperature dependence of the spectral functions and condensates can be tested  @xcite .    a low - temperature medium at vanishing chemical potential can be represented by a dilute gas of thermally excited pions . in ref .",

    "this result holds for any vacuum spectral function provided that no further adjustments are applied , e.g. , in the treatment of the continua  @xcite .",

    ", the temperature corrections to the vector 4-quark condensate can be written in terms of the chirally breaking 4-quark condensate , @xmath117 thus the rhs takes the form @xmath118 comparing the lhs and rhs of the qcdsrs one now sees that the chirally breaking 4-quark condensate cancels between the two sides while the remaining terms are simply the vector qcdsr in vacuum .",
    "a similar derivation can be made for the axial - vector channel as well .",
    "thus , for massless pions , the qcdsrs are analytically satisfied to order @xmath119 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , for finite pion mass , some of the simplifications on the ope side no longer occur .",
    "the expressions for the lhs remain unchanged , while the temperature dependence of the vector 4-quark condensate still can be expressed in turns of the chirally breaking 4-quark condensate so that the cancelation between the two sides for this term occurs .",

    "most notably , there is an incomplete cancelation between the temperature corrections of the quark condensate , the gluon condensate , and the twist-2 , spin-2 condensates .",
    "a similar lack of cancelation applies to the dimension-6 nonscalar operators .",

    "[ fig : qcdft ] for four different temperatures as a function of borel mass , while table  [ tab : qcdsrt ] quantifies the average deviation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dvalue ] ) , over the pertinent in - medium borel window .",
    "since neither channel s vacuum spectral functions exactly satisfy the vacuum qcdsrs , residual vacuum deviations will contribute to the in - medium analysis .",
    "therefore it is important to compare the in - medium deviations with the vacuum s deviation .",
    "overall , the @xmath77 values stay within a factor of two of the vacuum values for temperatures up to 120 - 140mev for the vector and axial - vector channels , respectively .",
    "these temperatures also roughly reflect the range within which the @xmath77 values are approximately linear in @xmath119 , as one would expect in the regime of validity .",
    "thus one may conclude that the qcdsrs are reasonably well satisfied up to these temperatures .",
    "let us address some of the uncertainties in the evaluation of the qcdsrs .",
    "closer inspection of the borel window reveals its lower end to expand significantly with temperature , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdft ] .",
    "the decrease of @xmath120 can be attributed to the decrease of the @xmath21 term with @xmath38 , i.e. , the 10%-level contribution of the @xmath121 moves to lower @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , the low - end portion of the borel window ( extending outside the vacuum window ) causes most of the increase of the deviation at higher temperature . if instead one postulates the in - medium borel window to be the same as in vacuum ( indicated by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdft ] ) , the @xmath77 values decrease appreciably at higher temperatures ( quoted in parenthesis in table  [ tab : qcdsrt ] ) , thus staying within a 1% margin up to temperatures as high as 160mev .",
    "further uncertainties are due to the non - scalar terms in the in - medium ope .",
    "the accuracy of the twist-2 contributions , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , is not well known , while @xmath74 has not been measured for the pion .",
    "we find the impact of the twist-2 terms on the @xmath77 values to be small , while @xmath74 produces a more significant deviation .",
    "for example , a 20% change in the value of @xmath68 causes a _ relative _ change of less than 0.7% in @xmath122 and @xmath123 for all temperatures .",
    "a similar variation in @xmath69 causes a larger relative deviation in @xmath122 and @xmath123 of @xmath124 at the higher temperatures , but less than @xmath125 at the lowest temperature .",
    "a larger uncertainty arises from the numerical value of @xmath74 .",
    "while this parameter has not been experimentally measured for the pion , a relative estimate of its size may be made by adopting the value for the nucleon , @xmath75 .",
    "we then find that @xmath122 is altered by less than 1% at 100mev but as much as 25% at 180mev .",
    "the effect on the axial - vector channel is not as pronounced with the maximum relative deviation of 5% at the highest temperature .",
    "let us finally put our results into context with previous works on in - medium sum rules .",
    "most qcdsr analyses thus far have been based on a ground - state plus continuum ansatz for the vector and/or axial - vector spectral function .",
    "this usually implied that ( a ) the continua in the two channels are different , and ( b ) a reduction of the in - medium threshold was deduced from the qcdsrs . both properties can potentially cause complications when carried out within a rigorous low - temperature implementation as given by chiral mixing , due to overlaps of the nonperturbative resonance regime with the perturbative continuum in the two channels .",
    "this becomes particularly problematic in the wsrs , whose low - temperature versions require a strict mixing of the entire vacuum spectral functions . in the present work ,",
    "we resolve this issue by employing vacuum spectral functions with a universal separation of nonperturbative and perturbative regimes , thanks to excited states and a degenerate continuum .",
    "this ensures a straightforward fulfillment of the low - temperature wsrs ( i.e. , within chiral mixing ) but also maintains a numerical agreement of the qcdsrs in both vector and axial - vector channels at low temperature .",
    "the wsrs and the qcdsrs for chirally mixed axial-/vector spectral functions are analytically satisfied in the chiral limit , without an apparent limitation due to temperature for their validity . however , for finite pion mass , the qcdsr are violated at order @xmath57 .",
    "the then - required numerical evaluation of the qcdsrs does exhibit deviations suggesting their breakdown at temperatures of the order of the pion mass .",
    "it is interesting that this breakdown roughly sets in at temperatures where one expects corrections from higher resonances to become important .",
    "this is not seen if only massless pions are considered .",
    "in the present work we have performed a simultaneous analysis of qcd and weinberg - type sum rules with vector and axial - vector spectral functions in the low - temperature limit .",
    "specifically , we have utilized updated vacuum spectral functions as an ingredient to their chiral mixing , and numerically evaluated the role of pion mass corrections in the sum rules .",
    "the in - medium spectral functions confirm earlier findings of a mutual flattening trend with increasing temperature . while the wsrs could be shown to remain valid analytically ( thereby avoiding a mixing of perturbative and nonperturbative components in the spectral functions ) , the finite pion mass corrections required a numerical analysis of the qcdsrs .",
    "they were found to be reasonably satisfied up to temperatures of about 140mev , with deviations markedly increasing beyond .",
    "this may be an indirect indication for additional physics , beyond low - energy chiral pion dynamics , which is , of course , well known from other contexts ( resonance excitations ) .",
    "our work may be extended to include more realistic medium effects , either by working to higher orders in @xmath41 and @xmath40 , or by considering spectral functions which are known to agree with dilepton emission data .",
    "it is instructive to note that even the most simple , yet rigorous , construction of low - temperature vector and axial - vector spectral functions satisfies sum rules rooted in qcd while suggesting a mechanism that could play a role toward their degeneration .",

    "<S> we analyze qcd and weinberg - type sum rules in a low - temperature pion gas using vector and axial - vector spectral functions following from the model - independent chiral - mixing scheme . toward this end </S>",
    "<S> we employ recently constructed vacuum spectral functions with ground and first - excited states in both channels and a universal perturbative continuum ; they quantitatively describe hadronic @xmath0-decay data and satisfy vacuum sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> these features facilitate the implementation of chiral mixing without further assumptions , and lead to in - medium spectral functions which exhibit a mutual tendency of compensating resonance and dip structures , suggestive for an approach toward structureless distributions . in the sum rule analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we account for pion mass corrections , which turn out to be significant . </S>",
    "<S> while the weinberg sum rules remain satisfied even at high temperatures , the numerical evaluation of the qcd sum rules for vector and axial - vector channels reveals significant deviations setting in for temperatures beyond @xmath1140mev , suggestive of additional physics beyond low - energy chiral pion dynamics . </S>"
