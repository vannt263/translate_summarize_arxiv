    "the commonly accepted paradigm for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is that they are formed in ultrarelativistic , collimated jets .",
    "typical terminal lorentz factors for these jets , such that the photons can freely escape , are @xmath1 a few hundreds , even above on thousand ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "opening angles @xmath2 are inferred from achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curves , although these are not clearly detected in several bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the lorentz factor decreases during the afterglow phase , and the break in the light curves occurs when the beaming angle equals @xmath2 , the product @xmath3 should be larger than one at the start of this phase , typically of the order of a few tens .    the long / soft class of grbs are thought to be connected with the death of massive stars , since some of them are associated with type ic supernovae and are observed in star - forming regions of the host galaxies ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . during this process a compact central object and accretion disk",
    "are formed , and the jet is powered by either the neutrino annihilation , or by magnetic fields , tapping the rotational energy of the central object or disk .",
    "it is not clear which of the two mechanisms ( or both ) operates , with the detection or not of the thermal photospheric emission being a key factor @xcite .",
    "thermal ( fireball ) acceleration is in general a fast and efficient process , with the lorentz factor increasing linearly with the cylindrical distance from the symmetry axis",
    ". magnetic acceleration also works provided that the jet is supported externally by an environment whose pressure does not drop faster than the inverse square of the distance from the origin , as was analytically shown in @xcite . the interior of the progenitor star could very well play this role .",
    "relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations by @xcite show that the efficiency of the magnetic acceleration is @xmath4 or more .",
    "the model faces two problems though : ( 1 ) the jet looses its external support when it exits the progenitor star , its motion becomes ballistic and its acceleration is practically halted .",
    "( 2 ) the magnetic acceleration requires that the flow is expanded in a way such that the separation between neighboring streamlines increases faster than the cylindrical radius .",
    "this is achieved through stronger collimation of the inner part of the outflow relative to the outer part , and for this reason the mechanism was dubbed _",
    "collimation - acceleration _ by @xcite .",
    "the resulting jets are very narrow with @xmath5 , and the product @xmath6 is close to unity before the start of the afterglow phase , making the breaks unlikely to happen .    a solution to both problems can be given by carefully studying the dynamics at the regime where the jet comes out from the star , and its external pressure drops to practically zero .",
    "@xcite simulated this transition and found that it is accompanied by a spurt of acceleration .",
    "@xcite confirmed their finding numerically and interpreted it as _ rarefaction acceleration_. the loss of external support induces a sideways expansion of the jet , and a strong rarefaction wave that is driven into the flow and accelerates it .",
    "in fact this is a powerful mechanism seen in other numerical simulations of both , hydrodynamic and mhd flows with contact discontinuity and flow along it , see @xcite .",
    "+ a similar mechanism was studied in @xcite , for the problem of an initially static magnetized plasma allowing to move into an environment .",

    "( for the hydrodynamic case this distance is a few orders of magnitude larger . )",
    "our model assumes planar geometry and symmetry , which only locally hold near the points where the surface of the jet intersects the stellar surface .",
    "improvements include axisymmetric studies , and also to take into account the reflection of the wave on the rotation axis , which will possibly cause the lorentz factor to saturate at a value smaller than the maximum ( a crude approximation of the time needed for the information to start from a fluid parcel passing the corner , hit the axis and come back at the same parcel is @xmath212 ) .",
    "axisymmetric studies are inherently nonuniform ( one of the reasons being that the magnetization vanishes on the rotation axis where the azimuthal magnetic field should be zero ) . for this reason comparison of numerical simulations of axisymmetric jets with our model that assumes a uniform jet",
    "initially should be done with caution at distances far away from the corner .",
    "another limitation is the assumption of a zero external pressure outside the progenitor star .",
    "a finite external pressure will create a standing shock and a contact discontinuity between the jet and its environment , and also limit the terminal lorentz factor to some value smaller than its maximum .",
    "our model can not capture this inherently non - self - similar geometry .",
    "nevertheless it describes the basic physics of the mechanism and gives quantitatively correct results for most of the rarefaction acceleration phase , till the point where the shock is crossed . since the pressure contrast inside and outside the progenitor star is expected to be high , only the small shocked outflow part can not be described by our model .",
    "all our findings are very similar to the ones discussed in @xcite .",
    "this is surprising at first , since their study is time dependent and one dimensional in space , while ours is steady - state and two dimensional in space .",
    "the reason for this similarity is the so - called frozen pulse approximation , first introduced by @xcite for a relativistic hydrodynamic flow and extended by @xcite for the full relativistic mhd case . according to this approximation , when",
    "a time dependent flow is ultrarelativistic and superfast - magnetosonic , it can be described using steady - state equations .",
    "the full mathematical proof can be found in appendix  [ appendixc ] .",
    "the physical reason is that each part of the flow moves practically with @xmath213 and can not communicate with neighboring parts through fast - magnetosonic waves ( which also move at most with @xmath213 ) .",
    "thus , a possible time dependence of the flow quantities at some point of space is carried with the flow as a frozen pulse , and the motion of each part is effectively time independent .",
