    "the data set analyzed includes the archival jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) data and the pushchino radio astronomy observatory ( prao ) data .",
    "the early timing observations of psr b0919 + 06 were carried out at the jpl at the frequency of 2388 mhz between 1979 december and 1983 march and covered a span of 3.2 years @xcite . at the prao ,",
    "timing observations of the pulsar were made between 1983 august and 2010 february .",
    "together , both the data sets cover the 30-year span from 1979 to 2009 with a four - year gap between 1987 and 1990 .",
    "an analysis of these experimental data showed that psr b0919 + 06 has unstable rotation over the entire data span .",
    "the timing residuals after the removal of deterministic pulsar spin - down from the arrival times are characterized by a large second derivative that indicates a high level of timing noise .",
    "two types of unpredictable variations may occur in the spin rate of pulsars  timing noise and glitches @xcite .",
    "timing noise is manifestation of random , continuous wandering of the pulse phase that may produce long - term polynomial trends in the timing residuals .",
    "glitches represent sudden , discrete jumps in the pulsar s rotation frequency , followed by an exponential recovery to the pre - glitch value .",
    "glitches are characterized by short rise times of less than one day and reveal themselves as sudden discontinuities in the timing residuals .",
    "a study of the timing behavior of the pulsars b1822@xmath709 and b1642@xmath703 has shown that there is another type of glitches which can be classified as peculiar or slow glitches ( * ? ? ?",

    "the rotation frequency of these pulsars undergoes continuous , slow oscillations during a long period of time . for the pulsar b1822@xmath709 ,",
    "the oscillatory changes in the rotation frequency were observed over the 19952004 interval . in the case of psr b1642@xmath703 ,",
    "cyclical changes in the timing residuals are observed during the 40-year period from 1969 to 2008 .",
    "this pulsar demonstrates such striking properties of the slow glitches which allow us to predict the epochs and the amplitudes of new glitches in its rotation frequency ( see sh09 ) .    in this paper , we study the rotation history of the pulsar b0919 + 06 over the 30-year period , report the detection of a large glitch , and show that cyclical changes in the timing residuals from this pulsar are due to the presence of slow glitches .",
    "these results indicate that two types of discontinuities , specified as normal and slow glitches , can occur in the rotation frequency of one pulsar .",
    "timing observations of the pulsar b0919 + 06 were carried out at the pushchino observatory for more than 26 years from 1983 august to 2010 february with a four - year gap between 1987 and 1990 .",
    "the observations were made with the large phased array of the pushchino observatory , which is a transit telescope , at frequencies near 102 or 112 mhz using a 64-channel radiometer with a channel bandwidth of 20 khz and a time resolution of 2.56 or 1.28 ms .",
    "the duration of one observation of psr b0919 + 06 was determined by the width of the antenna beam at the pulsar declination and lasted 3.2 minutes . during this time",
    ", 450 individual pulses were summed synchronously with a predicted topocentric pulsar period to produce the mean pulse profile in each 20 khz channel .",
    "after dispersion removal , all the channel profiles were summed to form an integrated pulse profile for the given observing session . then this integrated profile was cross - correlated with a standard low - noise template to give the topocentric pulse arrival times for each observing session .",
    "the topocentric arrival times collected at prao and the geocentric arrival times obtained from the archival jpl timing data were all referred to as the barycenter of the solar system at infinite frequency using the program tempo and the jpl de200 ephemeris .",
    "the position and the proper motion that are required for this correction were taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in order to obtain residuals from the timing model ,",
    "the pulsar s rotation is modeled by a polynomial including several frequency derivatives . in accordance with a taylor expansion , the pulse phase @xmath9 at the barycentric arrival time @xmath10",

    "the timing residuals , obtained as differences between the observed times and the times predicted by a best fit model , were used for an analysis of the rotation behavior of the pulsar .",

    "in 2009 november 5 , the pulsar b0919 + 06 suffered a very large glitch with the fractional increase in the rotation frequency @xmath20 .",
    "this glitch is comparable in size to the glitches observed in the vela pulsar .",
    "the glitch was accompanied by a significant decrease in the frequency derivative @xmath21 .",
    "a glitch was detected during a series of daily observations , so the uncertainty in determining the glitch epoch was within several hours , mjd 55139.8(1 ) .",
    "figure  [ glitch ] shows the timing residuals relative to a simple @xmath13 , @xmath17 model fitted to the data before the glitch . the negative growth in the residuals due to this glitch corresponds to a shift of the pulse in the observing window by @xmath2 109 ms / day .",
    "the glitch parameters are given in table  [ glitchp ] .",
    "uncertainties in parentheses represent the formal standard deviation and refer to the last digit quoted .",
    "the large glitch has occurred in a relatively old pulsar with a characteristic age of @xmath22 years .",
    "this age is comparable to the age of psr b0355 + 54 ( @xmath23 years ) that experienced a giant glitch with @xmath24 in 1987 @xcite .",
    "the timing observations of psr b0919 + 06 over four months after the glitch are not sufficient for the detailed research of the post - glitch behavior . moreover , as will be shown in the following sections , the rotation frequency of this pulsar undergoes continuous , slow oscillations with the spacing of maxima @xmath2 600 days .",
    "further observations are needed to establish a relationship between the large glitch and this oscillatory behavior .",
    "the timing behavior of psr b0919 + 06 over the 30-year interval from 1979 december to 2009 november before the large glitch occurred is presented in figure  [ resid1 ] . a four - year data gap seen in the residuals between 1987 and 1990",
    "insignificantly distorts the information about the pulsar s rotation .",
    "an analysis of the full data set showed that the timing behavior of psr b0919 + 06 exhibits significant deviations from a deterministic spin - down low that indicates a presence of large timing noise .",
    "so , the pulsar s rotation was modeled by polynomials including several frequency derivatives .",
    "the timing residuals after subtraction of the third - order polynomial for @xmath13 and two frequency derivatives @xmath17 and @xmath19 are shown in figure  [ resid1](a ) .",
    "the corresponding rotation parameters for the model 19792009 are given in table  [ model ] .",
    "the post - fit residuals display a large quartic term with the amplitude approximately equal to half the pulsar period .",
    "this plot shows that the residual curve has weak but well noticeable short - term cyclical structure over the entire time span .",
    "this cyclical structure become more discernible in the timing residuals presented in figure  [ resid1](b ) .",
    "the post - fit residuals obtained after subtraction of a polynomial including @xmath13 and three frequency derivatives exhibit the three maxima of a large - scale structure .",
    "the timing model with higher - order derivatives , for example , with four or five frequency derivatives , gives similar post - fit residuals and does not remove this structure from the timing residuals .",
    "its origin is uncertain .",
    "we pay attention to the short - term cyclical structure superimposed on this residual curve .",
    "it contains 19 cycles which are located through the intervals approximately equal to 600 days .",
    "the properties of just this cyclical structure will be studied in detail in the following sections .",
    "the changes in the rotation frequency with time are shown in figure  [ resid1](c ) . the curve a marks the frequency residuals @xmath18 relative to the mean rotation parameters @xmath13 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 over the 19792009 interval ( table  [ model ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath13 were calculated from the local fits , performed to the pulse arrival times over the intervals of @xmath2 300 days .",
    "this interval is approximately equal to half a cycle duration in the timing residuals .",
    "the strong curvature of the @xmath18 curve is due to the presence of higher - order frequency derivatives which are not taken into account by the timing model .",
    "the curve a clearly shows that the signature of the frequency residuals @xmath18 has a sawtooth - like character .",
    "this pattern is well appreciable over the interval 19912009 .",
    "the observed appearance of the @xmath18 changes indicates that the rotation frequency of the pulsar underwent slow oscillations during all the observational interval .",
    "these slow oscillations in @xmath13 give rise to cyclical changes in the timing residuals .",
    "our purpose is to determine the cause of slow oscillations in the pulsar s rotation frequency .",
    "because of the paucity of data between 1979 and 1986 , the properties of this oscillatory structure will be investigated over the time span from 1991 to 2009 where there is a great deal of experimental data .",
    "figure  [ resid2 ] exhibits the timing behavior of the pulsar over the 19-year period between 1991 january and 2009",
    "figure  [ resid2](a ) displays the timing residuals after subtraction of a polynomial including @xmath13 and two frequency derivatives .",
    "the rotation parameters measured over this period are given in table  [ model ] .",
    "the last point in the residual curve indicates the large glitch that occurred in 2009 november 5 .",
    "the short - term cyclical structure is clearly seen in the timing residuals .",
    "the timing residuals after subtraction of a polynomial including @xmath13 and five frequency derivatives are given in figure  [ resid2](b ) .",
    "this plot shows a clear cyclical structure that contains 12 cycles with the amplitudes of about 10 ms and the spacing of maxima of about 600 days .",
    "comparison of the timing residuals presented in figures  [ resid1](a ) and [ resid1](b ) and figures  [ resid2](a ) and [ resid2](b ) exhibits that the epochs and the spacing of the maxima of these cycles are the same in all the plots and do not depend on the time span of the data analyzed and the polynomial model fitted . at the same time , the shape and amplitude of these cycles are different in these plots .    the time behavior of the frequency residuals @xmath18 and the frequency derivative @xmath17 relative to the mean rotation parameters for the model 19912009 from table  [ model ] are presented in figures  [ resid2](c ) and [ resid2](d ) .",
    "the plotted values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 were calculated from the local fits , performed to arrival time data over the intervals of @xmath2 150 days that overlapped by 75 days .",
    "then the eight points in @xmath18 will correspond to a cycle duration of 600 days in the timing residuals .",
    "it is clearly seen from figure  [ resid2](c ) that the rotation frequency of the pulsar b0919 + 06 slowly oscillates during the time interval observed . in each successive cycle , the stage of increase in @xmath18 is followed by the stage of decrease in @xmath18 .",
    "this oscillatory process looks like a continuous sequence of 12 glitch - like events .",
    "in contrast to normal glitches , these events can be classified as peculiar or slow glitches because they exhibit long rise times of about a few hundred days .",
    "the similar glitch phenomenon was observed earlier in the pulsar b1642@xmath703 ( see sh09 ) .",
    "figure  [ resid2](d ) shows that the time changes in the frequency derivative @xmath17 are the effect of the changes in @xmath18 .",
    "the peaks of @xmath25 define the steepness of the front in the @xmath18 cycles . in order to study the properties of the slow glitches observed ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain the shape of the @xmath18 cycles which is not distorted by the presence of the timing noise .      from figure  [ resid2](c )",
    ", it is seen that the @xmath18 curve shows appreciable deviations relative to the timing model 1991 - 2009 .",
    "these deviations are a result of the variations in @xmath17 due to higher - order frequency derivatives which are not taken into account by the timing model . in order to obtain the undistorted shape of the @xmath18 cycles",
    ", we should calculate the frequency residuals @xmath18 relative to several timing models that describe the data over the shorter time intervals , including a few slow glitches .",
    "a measured magnitude of @xmath19 is so large that a simple @xmath26 spin down model can not be used to describe the experimental data even over the short intervals .",
    "besides , @xmath19 changes a sign within the interval 19912009 .",
    "the positive value @xmath27 measured over the interval 19912002 becomes negative @xmath28 over the next interval 20022009 .",
    "the maximum length of each short time interval was determined by such quantity of the @xmath18 cycles that the timing residuals relative to the model , including the mean values of @xmath13 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 defined over this interval , were nearly symmetrical with respect to the @xmath29-axis .",
    "we found the three suitable time intervals on which the pulse arrival times , corresponding to a few slow glitches , are well described by the @xmath30 model .",
    "the timing model 1991 - 1995 was used to define the frequency residuals @xmath18 for glitches 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ; the model 1995 - 2004  for glitches 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ; the model 20042009  for glitches 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 .",
    "the frequency residuals @xmath18 defined relative to these three models were combined then into a single data set .",
    "this adjusted set of the @xmath18 cycles describing the shape of 12 slow glitches is plotted in figure  [ form](a ) .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath18 curve is nearly symmetrical with respect to the zero line .",
    "this indicates that the shapes of the slow glitches were reconstructed rather correctly ( compare with figure  [ resid2](c ) ) .",
    "the parameters describing the sequence of 12 slow glitches plotted in figure  [ form](a ) are given in table  [ param ] .",
    "the parameters are presented in the following order : the glitch number ; epoch of the point @xmath31 , which corresponds to the minimum deviation of @xmath32 ; epoch of the point @xmath33 , which corresponds to the maximum deviation of @xmath34 ; the glitch amplitude @xmath35 ; the time interval to the next glitch @xmath36 ; the time interval between the minimal points of the @xmath18 cycles @xmath37 ; the rise time interval @xmath38 ; the relaxation time interval after the glitch @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ form](a ) and table  [ param ] allow us to study the properties of the slow glitches in the dependence on the glitch number .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ depend ] .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ depend ] shows the relation between the glitch amplitude and the glitch number .",
    "it is seen that all the slow glitches have approximately an identical amplitude equal to @xmath40 hz , where the error in parentheses is the formal standard deviation .",
    "the middle panel shows the relation between the time intervals @xmath36 ( the interval between the successive glitches ) and @xmath37 ( the interval between the minimal points of the @xmath18 cycles ) and the glitch number .",
    "this plot shows that the indicated intervals are approximately equal to 580 and 600 days , respectively .",
    "the bottom panel shows the relation between the glitch parameters @xmath41 ( the relaxation time interval ) and @xmath42 ( the rise time interval ) and the glitch number and defines the average values of these parameters equal to 400 and 180 days , respectively .",
    "these three relations indicate that all the slow glitches observed have similar properties which can be described by the following average parameters .",
    "the glitches have a small absolute amplitude equal to @xmath43 hz .",
    "they are characterized by the identical inter - glitch intervals @xmath36 and approximately the same width of the intervals @xmath37 , equal to @xmath2 600 days .",
    "the glitches have similar signature related to a slow increase in the rotation frequency during @xmath2 200 days and the subsequent relaxation back to the pre - glitch value during @xmath2 400 days . the relaxation after all the glitches",
    "can be described by a linear curve as is seen from figure  [ form](a ) .",
    "these properties suggest that the sequence of the slow glitches observed can be approximated by a sawtooth - like function .",
    "we created the model sawtooth - like curve using the indicated average parameters .",
    "this model curve has the starting point mjd 48350 and includes 10 cycles consisting of two stages  the stage of a linear glitch arising with a timescale of 200 days and the stage of a linear post - glitch relaxation with a timescale of 400 days .",
    "only two glitches observed , 2 and 3 , take off from this sequence .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath18 cycles showed that event 2 represents the sum of two partially overlapping glitches 2 and 3 .",
    "glitch 3 defines the starting point of a new phase in the sequence of the slow glitches .",
    "therefore , event 2 should be described by three stages  the stage of a linear glitch arising with a timescale of 200 days is followed by the stage in which the glitch amplitude keeps constant within 400 days ( the duration of this interval corresponds to the duration of the relaxation time interval @xmath41 ) and only then is followed by a linear post - glitch relaxation with a timescale of 400 days .",
    "the derived values for this model sawtooth - like curve are given in table  [ sawt ] .",
    "figure  [ form](b ) shows a model sawtooth - like curve with a period of 600 days which is superimposed on the glitch sequence observed .",
    "it is seen that the maxima of the model curve well coincide with the maxima of nearly all the slow glitches .",
    "only the maxima of glitches 8 and 9 slightly do not correspond to the model curve .",
    "however , as is seen from the plot , the slight deviations of the amplitude and phase of these cycles from a model curve do not change a phase of the next cycles of the sequence .",
    "probably , the shape of these glitches was not restored precisely .",
    "the model curve very well describes partially overlapping glitches 2 and 3 .",
    "it is seen that in this range there was a phase shift for 400 days , exactly equal to @xmath41 .",
    "after that , point 3 started marking the starting point of a new phase in the sequence of the slow glitches . despite the phase shift between points 2 and 3",
    ", we suppose that the model sawtooth - like function is a periodic function . a comparison of the model parameters @xmath31 and @xmath33 , given in table  [ sawt ] , and the same experimental parameters , listed in table  [ param ] , shows that these parameters agree well within a precision limited by the time resolution of @xmath2 100 days . we conclude that a model periodic sawtooth - like function approximates a sequence of the slow glitches observed very well .",
    "this result indicates a surprising regularity in the occurrence of slow glitches  the time intervals between the slow glitches , equal to 600 days , keep constant within approximately of 100 days during @xmath2 19 years .",
    "thus , we found that the cause of slow oscillations in the rotation frequency of psr b0919 + 06 over the 19912009 interval lies in a continuous generation of slow glitches .",
    "the originality of these slow glitches is that they have similar properties and their sequence is described by a periodic sawtooth - like function .",
    "estimates show that the time intervals between glitches remain constant within 100 days during @xmath2 19 years .",
    "the regular occurrence of similar slow glitches creates the sawtooth - like pattern in the frequency residuals with a period of 600 days .",
    "the presence of the regular pattern over a long time - span of 19 years indicates that the slow glitches observed are not random events .",
    "this conclusion is also valid for the full time span 19792009 .",
    "figure  [ resid1](c ) displays the curve b which represents the model sawtooth - like curve extended by an initial data segment 19791986 .",
    "poor and irregular experimental points obtained over this interval give an approximate picture of oscillations observed in the frequency residuals @xmath18 and the timing residuals .",
    "nevertheless , as is seen in figures  [ resid1](b ) and  [ resid1](c ) , the cycles in the model sawtooth - like curve b correspond well to cyclical changes in the frequency and timing residuals .",
    "the curve b shows how cyclical changes in the rotation frequency could look if the pulsar s rotation was described by a simple spin - down model over the interval 19792009 .",
    "an analysis of the rotation behavior of the pulsar b0919 + 06 over the 30-year period from 1979 to 2009 has shown that the nature of cyclical changes in the timing residuals from this pulsar implies a continuous generation of slow glitches which have similar properties .",
    "they are characterized by small sizes of @xmath44 hz , long rise times of 200 days , and relaxation time intervals of 400 days .",
    "we found that a sequence of the slow glitches observed over the 1991 - 2009 interval is well approximated by a periodic sawtooth - like function with a period of 600 days .",
    "estimates show that the time intervals between the slow glitches observed keep constant within approximately 100 days during this period . in figure  [ resid1](c )",
    ", the curve b suggests that this conclusion can be generalized to all the observational interval 19792009 .",
    "we may suppose that a sequence of similar slow glitches occurring at regular time intervals produced a sawtooth - like modulation of the rotation frequency , superimposed on the secular spin down , during all the period 19792009 .",
    "an analysis of the pulse arrival times showed that the process , responsible for a generation of the slow glitches over @xmath2 30 years , was interrupted by the large glitch of magnitude @xmath45 that occurred in 2009 november 5 .",
    "slow glitches as a unique glitch phenomenon were originally detected for the pulsar b1822@xmath709 in the timing observations which are carried out at the pushchino radio telescope since 1991 @xcite .",
    "further observations showed that this pulsar experienced a series of five slow glitches and also suffered three glitches of normal signature @xcite .",
    "the slow glitches observed were characterized by a gradual increase in the rotation frequency with a long rise time of 100300 days .",
    "it was found that all these slow glitches were the components of one process that acted continuously during @xmath2 10 years from 1995 to 2004 .",
    "then these events were followed by two glitches of normal signature .",
    "the glitches of magnitude @xmath46 and @xmath47 occurred in 2006 january and 2007 january , respectively @xcite .",
    "all these events clearly show the presence of two types of discontinuities in the rotation frequency of the pulsar b1822@xmath709 .",
    "these discontinuities can be classified as normal and slow glitches .",
    "the pulsar b1642@xmath703 is the second pulsar known , after psr b1822 - 09 , in the rotation frequency of which slow glitches were revealed .",
    "as shown in sh09 , the rotation frequency of this pulsar undergoes continuous generation of slow glitches and over the 40-year period of observations this pulsar suffered eight slow glitches .",
    "the amplitude of these glitches and the time interval to the next glitch obey a clear linear relation .",
    "this dependence gives strong evidence against the statement that slow glitches can be caused by the same process as the timing noise in pulsars @xcite .",
    "the existence of the modulation process which causes the discrete changes of the glitch amplitudes and the post - glitch time intervals in the dependence on the serial number of the glitch in a given modulation period also confirms that the slow glitches observed are the distinct events .",
    "the indicated dependencies allow us to predict the epochs and sizes of new glitches in this pulsar .",
    "the verification of these predictions can be obtained in the near future , in 2013 .",
    "this verification will provide strongest evidence that the slow glitches observed are a unique glitch phenomenon .",
    "the pulsar b0919 + 06 is the third pulsar in our research that experienced slow glitches in its rotation frequency .",
    "the main properties of slow glitches observed are a similarity in their signatures and a regularity in their occurrence .",
    "the regular occurrence of similar slow glitches produces a periodic sawtooth - like modulation of the rotation frequency with a period of 600 days . as discussed above",
    ", the timing residuals do not show strictly periodic cyclical changes because this pulsar possesses a high level of timing noise and the observed amplitude and the shape of the cycles depend on a polynomial model fitted .",
    "a derived sawtooth - like modulation of the rotation frequency , shown in figure  [ resid1](c ) by the curve b , is a result of reconstruction of cyclical changes that could take place in the pulsar s rotation frequency if the pulsar rotation is modeled by a simple spin down model .",
    "the curve b reflects the properties of an actual process that generated slow glitches during @xmath2 30 years .",
    "this process was interrupted by a large glitch that occurred in 2009 november .",
    "the pulsar b0919 + 06 , as well as b1822@xmath709 , clearly exhibits that the pulsar s rotation frequency underwent two types of discontinuities that can be classified as normal and slow glitches .",
    "comparison of the rotation parameters for the pulsars showing the slow glitches is presented in table  [ 3psr ] where the pulsars are listed in order of decreasing of their age .",
    "the table gives the pulsar s b1950 name , the rotation parameters @xmath13 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 , characteristic age @xmath48 , and surface magnetic field @xmath49 g. it is seen that all these pulsars are relatively old pulsars with ages greater than @xmath50 years .",
    "the oldest pulsar b1642@xmath703 has only the slow glitches .",
    "their amplitude and the time interval between glitches strictly obey a certain law , that is , the glitch sequence in this pulsar possesses the predicted , steady - state properties .",
    "the two others , b0919 + 06 and b1822@xmath709 , are substantially younger , have the higher frequency derivatives @xmath17 and @xmath19 , and the stronger magnetic fields .",
    "they experience large glitches of normal signature that followed the oscillatory process in the rotation frequency identified with slow glitches .",
    "a comparison of the pulsar parameters in this table indicates that a tendency to have a sequence of slow glitches with steady - state properties is correlated with the characteristic age of the pulsar .",
    "probably , the number of pulsars with slow glitches in their rotation frequency will considerably increase in the future .",
    "the candidates can be pulsars that exhibit cyclical changes in the timing residuals .",
    "long sequences of the timing residuals were recently published for 366 pulsars observed at the jodrell bank between 1968 and 2006 @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of these data shows that the timing residuals of some pulsars have clear cyclical changes during all the period of observations .",
    "according to @xcite , the quasi - periodic structure in the timing residuals is clearly visible for six pulsars : b1540@xmath706 , b1642@xmath703 , b1818@xmath704 , b1826@xmath717 , b1828@xmath711 , and b2148 + 63 .",
    "it should be noted that all these pulsars are old pulsars with ages varying from @xmath51 to @xmath52 years . among these pulsars",
    "there are two pulsars b1642@xmath703 and b1828@xmath711 that were investigated earlier .",
    "the results of spectral analysis by @xcite for these two pulsars agree with the results of previous papers @xcite .",
    "it is known that clear periodic structure in the timing residuals of b1828@xmath711 that is accompanied by correlated pulse shape changes is explained by free - precession of the neutron star @xcite . in the case of psr 1642@xmath703 , multiple low frequency components in the power spectrum of timing residuals can be explained well as a result of continuous generation of slow glitches , the amplitude of which is correlated with the time interval following the glitch @xcite .    as reported by @xcite ,",
    "the slow glitches have been identified yet for two pulsars j0631 + 1036 and b1907 + 10 .",
    "the first pulsar is a young pulsar with @xmath53 years , and the second one is substantially older with @xmath54 years .",
    "the latter has cyclical timing residuals , as is shown in figure 3 of @xcite , that can imply cyclical changes in the rotation frequency .",
    "it is thought that pulsar glitches reflect a variable coupling between the solid crust of a neutron star and the superfluid interior rotating more rapidly than the solid crust . in terms of vortex",
    "pinning models , the origin of glitches can be explained by the catastrophic unpinning of superfluid vortices @xcite .",
    "these models provide a satisfactory interpretation of large glitches in pulsars .",
    "now the interpretation of a phenomenon of slow glitches is uncertain . according to @xcite ,",
    "the slow glitch phenomenon is a quasi - periodic component of timing noise , unrelated to normal glitches . at the same time",
    ", the slow glitches revealed in psr b1642@xmath703 possess the properties which meet the requirements of the glitch models : 1 ) all the slow glitches observed have significant exponential decay after glitch which is characterized by the same parameter @xmath55 , 2 ) the size of glitches and the time interval to the following glitch obey a strong linear relation .",
    "the third property , the presence of a modulation process which forces the glitch amplitudes and the inter - glitch intervals to change with a discrete step , was not considered yet by any theory of pulsar glitches . in the case of slow glitches , it is necessary to account for the cause of a continuous generation of slow glitches .    for psr b0919 + 06 , a sawtooth - like modulation of the rotation frequency with a period of 600 days could be interpreted by the free precession of an isolated pulsar if this modulation was accompanied by correlated observable changes in the pulse profile @xcite .",
    "we detected no pulse profile changes during our observations at 112 mhz .",
    "a precession model requires a strictly periodic modulation of the pulsar s rotation frequency .",
    "the presence of the phase shift , equal to 400 days , in the modulation curve b between cycles 9 and 10 , as is shown in figure  [ resid1](c ) , contradicts this requirement .",
    "these two arguments testify against the interpretation of this sawtooth - like modulation in the terms of a free precession model . besides",
    ", this pulsar has experienced a large glitch . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", a slowly precessing neutron star can not produce a glitch",
    ". the useful information for explanation of an origin of slow glitches can be obtained from further timing observations of psr b0919 + 06 .",
    "the observations in the nearest 510 years allow us to find out whether there is a relationship between different phenomena observed in this pulsar , such as a large glitch and a sequence of the slow glitches .",
    "whether a large glitch has put a stop to a process of generation of slow glitches or this process continues to work after a large glitch in the same mode .",
    "i should like to thank r. d. dagkesamansky for useful discussion and comments , the staff of the prao for their aid in carrying out the many - year observations of this pulsar on the lpa antenna .",
