    "we use this limit to simplify the scattering integral and show that the calculated value of @xmath27 is self - consistent .",
    "the sink term for the boosted distribution is given by the zero - modes of the scattering integral linearised about an antisymmetric , boosted distribution .",

    "further evidence of the profound non - equilibrium nature of the steady state is provided by the different temperature scales characterising the current noise and the steady - state distribution .",
    "curiously , other calculations have found that both the response function and fluctuations depend upon the same effective temperature and are related by an apparent fluctuation dissipation relation  @xcite at all frequencies even though the steady state itself is characterised by a different effective temperature .",
    "we end with some words about the feasibility of realising these results experimentally .",
    "this may be possible either in cold atomic gasses - in which the bose hubbard model has been realised  @xcite along with effective fields through potential gradients or otherwise  @xcite - or else in solid state systems with particle - hole symmetry such as graphene . in both cases ,",
    "the main limitation is the difficulty of appropriate coupling to a bath .",
    "this may be accompanied by thermal boundary resistivity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , any deviation from particle - hole symmetry may lead to significant constraints upon the size of system over which universal results may be observed  @xcite .",
    "one fascinating way around this is suggested in an elegant recent work , ref.@xcite where the system in effect acts as its own thermal bath with the universal non - equilibrium steady state in a limited region of the sample ."
