    "magnetic reconnection is a process in which magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy as the topology of the magnetic field changes .",
    "this process can produce fast energy transfer and accelerate particles to high energies . in the relativistic reconnection regime ( see @xcite for a review ) where",
    "the ratio of the magnetic energy to the total enthalpy of the particles ( the magnetization @xmath0 ) is much larger than 1 , emission from these high - energy particles has been hypothesized to produce observed high - energy emission in various astrophysical contexts .",
    "systems whose emission may be explained by relativistic reconnection include the prompt phase of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite pulsar wind nebulae @xcite , and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) jets @xcite .",
    "one of the features of magnetic reconnection is that it may be able to evade a constraint on particle acceleration called the synchrotron burnoff limit @xcite .",
    "this constraint can be derived by equating the synchrotron energy loss from a particle ( which increases with the lorentz factor of a particle as @xmath1 ) , with the energy gain from electrical acceleration ( which is independent of @xmath2 ) .",
    "this produces a maximum energy reachable by synchrotron radiation from electromagnetically accelerated particles of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electron mass , @xmath5 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath6 is the speed of light , @xmath7 is the typical electric field that accelerates particles , and @xmath8 is the typical magnetic field should be @xmath9 because only the magnetic field perpendicular to the particle s motion is responsible for synchrotron radiation .",
    "but unless there are special geometric constraints the perpendicular magnetic field is similar to the background magnetic field . in the case of harris - like magnetic reconnection @xcite",
    "that is investigated in this paper , the motion of accelerating particles is primarily perpendicular to the reversing field .",
    "unless a very strong guide field is present , @xmath8 is therefore approximately equal to both the reversing field and the background field . ] that is responsible for synchrotron radiation . in ideal plasmas like those involved in the simplest models of shock acceleration @xmath10 ,",
    "so synchrotron emission can not be produced above @xmath11 mev , the maximum synchrotron burnoff limit .",
    "yet there are many systems that appear to go above this limit .",
    "observations of gamma - ray flares in the crab nebula @xcite present a clear case of emission beyond the synchrotron burnoff limit , with peak energies of 375 mev with significant radiation up to 1 gev @xcite and there is no evidence of ultrarelativistic motion there @xcite to boost the photon energy .",
    "there are also other cases of high - energy emission which may involve synchrotron radiation .",
    "the extended emission at energies of up to 300 gev in grbs @xcite seems to require rest - frame photon energies above 160 mev , although the emission may be inverse compton radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "tev flares observed in agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seem to require relativistic motion within the jet to escape scattering in the emission region @xcite , but they may also involve rest - frame synchrotron emission above the burnoff limit .    in order to produce emission beyond 160 mev , it is necessary to decouple particle acceleration and cooling so that the constraint @xmath10 no longer applies . in the context of relativistic shocks , particles may accelerate in the background field but radiate in spatially varying or microturbulent fields near the shock in the synchrotron @xcite or jitter @xcite regimes . but numerical simulations indicate that particle acceleration in relativistic shocks is unlikely to be efficient enough to produce synchrotron radiation beyond 160 mev @xcite , and particles in these shocks are unlikely to emit in the jitter regime @xcite .    in contrast",
    ", magnetic reconnection naturally produces emission above the maximum synchrotron burnoff limit . in the diffusion region of magnetic reconnection , where much of the particle acceleration takes place , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "significant cooling only occurs after the particle has left the acceleration region .",
    "thus , particle acceleration and cooling are naturally decoupled in magnetic reconnection .",
    "analytical studies of magnetic reconnection @xcite and a test particle study in a fixed reconnection geometry @xcite indicate that particle acceleration through this mechanism is not limited by cooling .",
    "these studies suggest that particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection can produce synchrotron radiation beyond the maximum burnoff limit .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations are the most common method for probing the acceleration of particles in fully dynamic magnetic reconnection .",
    "these simulations , which focus on the pair - plasma case which is easier to simulate and is directly applicable to the crab nebula , have shown that relativistic reconnection can produce hard non - thermal tails of highly accelerated particles that are typically interpreted as power laws @xcite . in general , the physics of reconnection is similar in two and three dimensions @xcite unless the initial reconnection structure is inherently three - dimensional , justifying the use of two - dimensional simulations which reduce computational cost and allow larger - scale simulations to be carried out .",
    "studies of the radiation produced by accelerated particles in reconnection that do not include the effect of cooling on particles @xcite indicate that radiation above the synchrotron burnoff limit should be highly beamed , and therefore highly variable , which is consistent with observations of fast variability in the crab flares @xcite .",
    "several researchers have used pic codes with a form of the radiation reaction force included @xcite to investigate the effects of cooling on particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection @xcite .",
    "they find that relativistic reconnection produces beamed particles and highly variable radiation above the synchrotron burnoff limit in both two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions .",
    "relativistic reconnection also produces high - energy radiation above the synchrotron burnoff limit in the presence of a guide field @xcite as long as it is weaker than the reversing field , and in reconnection produced by the collapse of a two - dimensional flux rope system @xcite .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that the production of radiation beyond the synchrotron burnoff limit is robust in relativistic magnetic reconnection . however , they are limited in dynamic range to @xmath14 decades in lorentz factor @xmath2 .",
    "the peaks of the corresponding radiation spectra are located at or below the burnoff limit , with the high - energy tail reaching above the limit by less than a factor of 10 in frequency .",
    "therefore , these simulations do not predict how far above the synchrotron burnoff limit radiation can be produced in relativistic reconnection .",
    "we overcome this problem in our simulations using the new test particle comparison ( tpc ) method .",
    "in this paper we use two - dimensional pic simulations including the radiation reaction force to reexamine the extent to which particles accelerated in relativistic reconnection can produce radiation above the synchrotron burnoff limit . in the absence of a large dynamic range in lorentz factor , which is difficult to produce from an initial thermal spectrum even in the largest simulations @xcite , we instead choose to trace particle trajectories to separate the effects of cooling during acceleration ( which limit the maximum radiation energy ) from the effects of cooling after acceleration is complete ( which do not limit it ) .",
    "but tracing particles throughout the whole simulation imposes significant computational costs , and it is nontrivial to correct for the different sizes and characteristics of dynamically changing acceleration regions throughout the system , which are expected to influence the effects of cooling on particle trajectories and acceleration .",
    "therefore , we carry out two simulations of relativistic reconnection in which the ( uncooled ) structural particles and fields that determine the evolution of the reconnection are identical , and compare the trajectories of test particles incident on a single typical reconnection region with and without cooling .",
    "this tpc method allows us to isolate the effects of cooling on accelerating particles in a fully dynamic reconnection region , because its properties are the same in both simulations .",
    "we calculate a prescription for the effects of cooling based on a particle s uncooled trajectory in the reconnection region and the acceleration it experiences there .",
    "we apply this prescription to analytically predict the effects of cooling on an uncooled power law energy spectrum produced in reconnection over a large dynamic range .",
    "we qualitatively confirm our results over a limited dynamic range by comparing the particle spectra in these uncooled simulations with the spectrum in a simulation in which structural particles are cooled .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : methods ] , we discuss our simulation methods , including our treatment of the radiation reaction force and a detailed discussion of the tpc method . in section [ sec :",
    "results ] , we discuss the results , and in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss the conclusions of our research .",
    "we use the particle - in - cell method to simulate reconnection .",
    "this method includes kinetic effects by discretizing the equations of electrodynamics ( the mean - field maxwell s equations and the lorentz force law ) , replacing groups of physical particles with larger macroparticles and tracking fields only on the vertices of a grid .",
    "we implement the pic simulations using the tristan - mp code @xcite , which uses current filtering to greatly reduce noise even at relatively small macroparticle densities .",
    "we initialize all of our simulations with a simple harris current sheet configuration that is susceptible to reconnection , described in section [ sec : init ] .",
    "our first two simulations have identical evolution for the structural particles ( which do not experience cooling ) and fields .",
    "after nonlinear reconnection has developed , we inject test particles that duplicate structural particles flowing into a single reconnection region in the current sheet with ( simulation tc ) and without ( simulation tu ) applying cooling to those test particles .",
    "using this tpc method allows us to isolate the effects of cooling and predict its effects in large - scale simulations . to do this",
    ", we first find a prescription for the energy loss due to cooling for an accelerating particle as a function of the particle s trajectory .",

    "we call @xmath18 the burrowing parameter , because it represents the extent to which the particle has burrowed into the current sheet and experienced a lower magnetic field than the background field . by finding the burrowing parameter as a function of the ( uncooled ) final energy of the test particles in the acceleration region",
    ", we can analytically predict the cooled particle energy spectrum from the uncooled spectrum , as explained in section [ sec : tpc ] .",

    "quantitatively , approximately @xmath104 of the accelerated particles with @xmath105 have @xmath106 .",
    "however , particles in x - point regions in this simulation always have @xmath107 , so the physics of particle acceleration and the high - energy part of the particle energy spectrum are unaffected by inaccuracies arising from the use of the classical radiation reaction force .",
    "we then compare of simulation ac with a simulation that is identical except for larger @xmath108 to verify that cooling does not greatly change the current sheet structure .",
    "we find that the small qualitative effects resulting from cooling found in simulation ac are verified in this additional simulation , and they are quantitatively even smaller as expected due to the weaker cooling .",
    "the reason that the inaccuracies have little effect is that they merely affect the details of how particles lose energy in islands after the end of particle acceleration . because the purpose of simulation ac is merely to test that particles can be accelerated beyond the burnoff limit and verify that cooling does not strongly affect the current sheet structure , we reserve more rigorous fully cooled simulations for future work .",
    "background particles in simulation ac are mildly relativistic and can cool slowly over the time of the simulation .",
    "this can distort the reconnection configuration in a way that would not occur in a realistic case in which the burnoff limit corresponds to a much higher lorentz factor @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , we turn off cooling in simulation ac for particles that are below @xmath110 to prevent background cooling from affecting the current sheet structure .",
    "the tpc method compares initially identical test particles entering a reconnection region with ( simulation tc ) and without ( simulation tu ) cooling to calculate the effect of cooling on a chosen uncooled spectrum over a large dynamic range .",
    "it assumes that the trajectories of these test particles , and the values of @xmath18 ( defined below ) that parameterize those trajectories , do not depend significantly on whether cooling is present . using this assumption",
    ", we can predict the maximum lorentz factor reached by a particle in simulation particle as a function of its trajectory and final lorentz factor in the uncooled simulation .    the local limit on particle acceleration resulting from cooling at a given point",
    "is given by equation ( [ eq : lorentzbo ] ) , with the local values of the fields replacing @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting local burnoff limit is given by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "we hypothesize that the global limiting lorentz factor for the particle is @xmath113 , where @xmath18 , called the burrowing parameter , is an average of @xmath114 over the particle s trajectory . because we are interested in the values of @xmath114 at locations where the particle radiates , we weight the average by the synchrotron power of the particle .",
    "in a simple approximation , synchrotron power is proportional to @xmath115 , so we define",

    "because both @xmath18 and @xmath119 on the right side of the equation are calculated in the uncooled simulation tu , this equation can be used to predict the effects of cooling in a simulation with a given value of @xmath84 without actually carrying out that simulation .",
    "the final step of the tpc method is the calculation of the distribution function for @xmath18 at any given value of @xmath120 using the measured trajectories . for",
    "any given uncooled particle energy spectrum , we can use this distribution function and the prescription ( [ eq : prescription ] ) to derive the cooled particle energy spectrum . in section 3.5 , we describe in detail how to derive the cooled spectrum corresponding to an uncooled power law energy spectrum and the distribution for @xmath18 at each @xmath121 that we find in our simulations .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : structure ] with a description of the overall structure of the current sheet in simulation tu as well as the characteristics of the x - point region we focus on in our analysis .",

    ", the current sheet has broken up into many x - point regions ( where reconnection takes place ) and high - density magnetic islands ( where outflows from the x - point regions meet ) .",
    "the right part of the figure shows an inset of the asymmetric x - point region into which test particles are injected in both simulations .",

    "the narrow reconnection region at , @xmath124 in the central part of the x - point region is identical in both plots , indicating that the magnetic field is far below the background as expected in reconnection regions .",
    "in contrast , in the outflow regions of the figure with @xmath125 the magnetic field is similar to that in the background but the density is enhanced , producing a lower @xmath126 that is consistent with expectations for outflow regions where particles are being ejected into the magnetic islands .",
    "the lower left panel shows the momentum structure of the reconnection region .",
    "this clearly indicates that the center of the x - point is indeed at @xmath127 .",
    "the maximum inflow momentum we find for this x - point region is @xmath128 , while typical outflow bulk momenta are @xmath129 .",
    "this is similar to the values found in @xcite for @xmath130 .    in order to calibrate our analysis of the test particle trajectories",
    ", we must find the value of @xmath86 in the x - point region .",
    "the lower right panel of the figure shows that the electric field is approximately uniform with @xmath131 throughout the central reconnection region ; therefore , we set @xmath132 for this region .",
    "since we chose @xmath87 for our simulations , the fiducial burnoff limit for particles in this x - point region is @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath86 is also a measurement of the reconnection rate , because in a steady state reconnection equilibrium @xmath134 .",
    "we also consider the results of two other methods of measuring the reconnection rate .",
    "one involves calculating the ratio of the inflow velocity to the alfvn velocity in the inflow region ( which is close to @xmath6 for relativistic plasmas ) ; with this definition , the typical reconnection rate shown in the lower left panel of figure 1 is @xmath135 .",
    "however , this is a local measure that overestimates the overall rate of energy conversion .",
    "another , global , method involves comparing the total kinetic energy gain to the maximum possible gain @xcite , with the equation    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is the total kinetic energy and @xmath138 is the total initial magnetic energy . with this definition , we find @xmath139 , which is consistent with ( but somewhat smaller than ) the reconnection rate calculated from @xmath86 .",
    "this indicates that the energy conversion rate in our chosen x - point is representative of that in the overall simulation .",
    "we select a sample of @xmath140 particles from the test particles the were initiated in the shaded regions in figure [ fig : overall ] and trace their trajectories within our chosen reconnection region in the cooled simulation tc and uncooled simulation tu the particles selected are approximately uniformly distributed in @xmath141 at @xmath142 well after all of the particles have left the x - point region .",
    "this enables us to calculate the properties of particles that have undergone differing amounts of acceleration with reasonable number statistics .",
    "we choose to calculate the properties of the electrons in the rest of this work , but the properties of the positrons are similar .",
    "we calculate the final lorentz factors for particles in the uncooled ( @xmath119 ) and cooled ( @xmath117 ) simulations as follows . to ensure that we calculate the final lorentz factor for the main acceleration episode for each particle and properly estimate the values of the fields during this episode",
    ", we restrict our analysis of trajectories to particles in the central x - point region at @xmath124 , where they accelerate in a region of low magnetic field .",
    "this restriction does not have a strong effect on our results , because particles do not spend much time or undergo a great deal of acceleration in the region @xmath143 .",
    "we then estimate the lorentz factor at the end of the acceleration episode by calculating the location where it reaches @xmath144 of its maximum value .",
    "this allows us to avoid including locations where the particle lorentz factor plateaus , resulting in an underestimation of the average electric field acceleration .",
    "because particles in the uncooled simulation may undergo multiple acceleration episodes , we add an additional stipulation : if the rate of energy gain by a particle falls below a fraction @xmath145 of the fiducial gain given by @xmath146 and the particle has reached @xmath147 of its maximum value in the x - point , we estimate that acceleration has ended at that location .",
    "figure [ fig : trajectories ] compares the trajectories within the chosen reconnection region of three particles cooled simulation tc and uncooled simulation tu ; all of the particles chosen were significantly accelerated in the current sheet with @xmath148 and significantly cooled before leaving the current sheet in the cooled simulations .",
    "the fact that a significant number of particles can reach such high energies is an indication that radiation does not directly prevent acceleration beyond the fiducial burnoff limit in magnetic reconnection .",
    "the figure shows that all of the particles undergo speiser orbits : they are accelerated by the reconnection electric field while oscillating across the current sheet in the @xmath149 direction .",

    "particles cooled and uncooled trajectories typically differ most in the phase of their oscillation across the current sheet , but cooled particles also tend to leave the x - point slightly earlier than the uncooled particles , probably because cooling has reduced their inertia against deflection out of the x - point region .",
    "the third panel shows the relatively rare case in which the cooled and uncooled particles exit in different directions .",
    "such particles are only around @xmath150 of all particles , but they are a somewhat larger proportion ( @xmath151 ) of the highly accelerated particles with @xmath148 . because few particles have trajectories that are strongly modified by cooling , it should be possible to use the properties of the particles in the uncooled simulation to predict the acceleration and cooling of the particles in the cooled simulation .",

    "may become important before the classical perturbation result breaks down .",

    ", we conservatively estimate that the accelerating particles experience a field @xmath8 in the plasma rest frame . because @xmath238 even in the diffusion region where @xmath239 , the lorentz transformation into the frame of a particle with cooled lorentz factor @xmath240 yields @xmath241 . combining this result with equation ( [ eq : bpcrit ] ) and the definition of @xmath242 then yields the condition for the validity of our classical analytical spectrum @xmath243",
    "our main conclusion that cooling has no effect below @xmath244 is valid if @xmath245 .",
    "this condition may be expressed as @xmath246    taking @xmath247 and @xmath184 , this equation gives @xmath248 , which corresponds via equation ( 10 ) to @xmath249 g. reconnection models that produce observed emission through the synchrotron mechanism in grb prompt emission @xcite , agn flares @xcite and the crab flares @xcite invoke magnetic field strengths far below this value ( 1 g-@xmath250 g , @xmath2511 g , and @xmath2511 mg , respectively ) .",
    "we also note that the presence of quantum effects for magnetic fields approaching @xmath252 is likely to lessen the strength of the radiation reaction force rather than increasing it , because the classical force includes photons with energy larger than the electron rest energy whose production will be suppressed by quantum effects .",
    "therefore , our derived spectrum below @xmath244 should accurately estimate the effects of cooling on particles accelerated in magnetic reconnection in these systems .",
    "we now compare the overall structure of simulation ac with cooling and simulation tu without cooling .",
    "we find that in simulation ac the evolution of the current sheet is somewhat slower , but the energy conversion rate is somewhat faster than in simulation tu .",
    "the global reconnection rate is approximately @xmath253 , which is @xmath254 higher than in the uncooled simulation . the typical reconnection electric field is @xmath255 , which is @xmath256 higher than in the uncooled simulation .    figure [ fig : overallcomp ] compares the densities and the average kinetic energies in the uncooled simulation tu and the cooled simulation ac at time @xmath50 .",
    "the density structures of the current sheets in the two runs are similar , except for the slower evolution , as are most other properties of the reconnection .",
    "the only significant difference is that the particles in the islands and outside of the center of the current sheet have been cooled to low energies @xmath257 ; as a result , the particle density at the very center of magnetic islands in simulation ac is extremely high , up to @xmath258 times the background density at the center point of islands .",
    "this cooling is in line with what we expect given that @xmath133 and particles are able to cool for many plasma times if they are not being accelerated in reconnection regions .",
    "we conclude that the structure of reconnection regions will not vary greatly due to cooling , and our test particle results may be approximately applied to uncooled simulations to estimate the effects of cooling .",
    "figure [ fig : energyspectra ] compares the particle energy spectra in the two simulations in the ( half ) box , in the x - point regions , and in the islands .",
    "the figure clearly shows that there is no cutoff at @xmath133 in any of these locations .",
    "the cutoff of the power laws is instead located at @xmath259 in both simulations and is a result of the saturation of acceleration due to low @xmath0 @xcite . for a magnetic field equal to @xmath8",
    "this corresponds to a cutoff synchrotron energy of over 16 times the burnoff limit in the cooled simulation",
    ". the cutoff synchrotron energy may be even higher than this because the edges of islands often have a magnetic field significantly larger than @xmath8 .",
    "thus , acceleration well beyond the burnoff limit is present even in these limited simulations .",
    "the power law index in the uncooled simulation is @xmath260 , and that in the cooled simulation is @xmath261 , with no obvious break in either spectrum .",
    "in contrast , our analytical power law model with @xmath184 predicts that because the beginning of the power law in simulation tu is located at @xmath262 , there will be a break in the cooled spectrum at @xmath263 with a power law index above the break of @xmath264 .",
    "the disagreement between the analytical model and the actual results is not surprising given the limited dynamical range of the simulations , but it is encouraging that the slope of the power law is indeed moderately steeper in the cooled simulation .    the population of particles in both the x - point regions and the islands is larger in the cooled simulation ac than in the uncooled simulation tu , reflecting the difference in reconnection rate . in the uncooled simulation tu ,",
    "the islands have far more particles than the x - points at almost all energies , with the x - points becoming important only at the highest energies of @xmath265 .",
    "this is because most particles eventually escape from the x - points after accelerating and enter islands without losing significant energy in the uncooled simulation , and can even undergo significant additional acceleration there @xcite . only at the highest energies are the x - points important , because particles that remain there are capable of accelerating for a longer time period than other particles .    in the cooled simulation ac , in contrast",
    ", the x - point population makes a significant contribution to the overall energy spectrum for @xmath266 and becomes dominant for @xmath267 .",
    "this is because the strong cooling experienced by particles in the islands greatly reduces their contribution to the high - energy particle spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the island particle spectrum still does not have a cutoff at @xmath133 , because particles are always flowing into the islands from the x - point regions as long as reconnection is ongoing , so that high - energy particles are continuously replenished there .",
    "overall , the burnoff limit does not limit the particle energy anywhere in the system in our fully cooled simulation ac , indicating that it is not an important limit at any stage of particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection .",
    "we do note that this conclusion is tentative in magnetic islands because particles there may have been affected by the presence of fields with @xmath268 , but the islands do not strongly affect the overall high - energy spectrum because the island and x - point populations are comparable there .",
    "this confirms that our analytical results obtained using the tpc method are correct , and indicates that particles can be accelerated above the burnoff limit by orders of magnitude .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the effect of cooling on particle acceleration in relativistic magnetic reconnection by using the tpc ( test particle comparison ) method , in which we compare test particle orbits in the same reconnection region with ( simulation tu ) and without ( simulation tc ) cooling .",
    "we also carried out an additional simulation ( simulation ac ) to find the effect of cooling on reconnection overall and confirm the utility of the tpc method and the parameterization of particle trajectories using the burrowing parameter @xmath18 .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    * the trajectories of the vast majority of accelerating particles are weakly affected by cooling .",
    "the most prominent effect of cooling is that the phase of oscillation across the current sheet is different for cooled particles , and cooled particles leave the x - point regions slightly earlier due to reduced inertia as a result of cooling . in rare cases , cooling causes a particle to exit the x - point region in the opposite direction from its uncooled path . *",
    "the acceleration of a particle in a cooled simulation can be derived from its acceleration in the uncooled simulation and its burrowing parameter @xmath18 using the prescription @xmath269 . here",
    ", the burrowing parameter @xmath270 indicates the extent to which the particle spends time in the current sheet and experiences a lower magnetic field ( and therefore a reduced amount of cooling ) . *",
    "the burrowing parameter @xmath18 of particles varies between approximately unity and @xmath271 , with @xmath184 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with analytical speiser orbit calculations , which predict that @xmath182 .",
    "* if the uncooled particle energy spectrum is a power law of the form @xmath272 , we predict analytically that when cooling is present the distribution @xmath273 will be the same up to @xmath274 .",
    "this is far above the burnoff limit of @xmath84 . above this break ,",
    "the power law index becomes @xmath275 , which is only a moderate break in the spectrum for @xmath276 .",
    "the unimportance of @xmath84 for the particle energy spectrum is confirmed in fully cooled simulation ac . * in the cooled simulation ac , the effect of overall cooling is to speed up the rate of energy transfer relative to the uncooled simulation tu while slightly slowing the current sheet evolution .",
    "however , there are no significant qualitative differences in the reconnection structure . *",
    "the particle energy spectrum in the fully cooled simulation ac is similar to that found in the uncooled simulation tu , and does not show any cutoff at @xmath133 . only in the islands is the form of the spectrum significantly different in the two simulations , because that is where accelerated particles experience significant cooling . * the analytical results from the tpc method",
    "are confirmed by the fully cooled simulation ac .",
    "we conclude that particles can be accelerated above the burnoff limit by many orders of magnitude .",
    "our analytical calculations of the effect of cooling on power law energy spectra , together with the measured particle energy spectra in the fully cooled pic simulation , confirm the conclusion of @xcite that particle acceleration is not limited by cooling .",
    "therefore , emission beyond the synchrotron burnoff limit is indeed well explained by a magnetic reconnection model .",
    "we now turn to the applications of our results in astrophysical contexts .",
    "we show here that reconnection is that the particle energy spectrum and the resulting radiation spectrum have no direct dependence on the burnoff limit .",
    "the tev emission in agn is far beyond the synchrotron burnoff limit ( even accounting for relativistic boosting of the bulk of the jet ) .",
    "this is consistent with being produced by reconnection . on the other hand ,",
    "if the crab flares are produced by reconnection it is necessary to explain why their peak energies are only a factor of @xmath277 above the maximum synchrotron burnoff limit of 160 mev .",
    "this difficulty can be resolved if the typical sizes of the flaring regions are small enough that electrons can not reach extreme energies except in the largest flares . alternatively ,",
    "if typical flaring regions have a strong guide field perpendicular to the plane of reconnection , most regions will not produce significant acceleration beyond 160 mev @xcite .",
    "if future studies of the morphology of the crab nebula during flaring activity are consistent one of these scenarios , they will provide further evidence that high - energy flares above 160 mev in the crab nebula are produced by particles accelerated in relativistic magnetic reconnection .",
