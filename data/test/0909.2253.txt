    "the end products of stellar evolution for 98% of all stars will be white dwarfs .",
    "this final state results because most stars are not massive enough to ignite c and o , so that nuclear reactions cease with the formation of a degenerate core of he or a combination of he , c , and o. with the cessation of nuclear reactions , white dwarfs emit light only via their cooling and become dimmer as time passes .",
    "these remnants have very thin surface layers of h and/or he , the bulk of the envelope having been blown away during relatively quiescent stages of mass loss in the progenitor star .",
    "for the oldest stellar populations , @xmath215% of the entire present day mass of the system is tied up in white dwarfs , and therefore their distribution and detailed properties represent a unique link to explore the nature of the now - evolved population ii progenitors .",
    "such studies are enhanced in star clusters where all of the remnants are co - spatial , have the same total age , and evolved from stars with the same metallicity , yet over a range in initial mass .        milky way globular star clusters",
    "have been dated to a formation time roughly 12  gyr ago ( e.g. , krauss & chaboyer 2003 ) , and therefore represent the first structures to form in the galaxy .",
    "these systems are one of the most important tools that we have to probe the formation and evolution processes of galaxies @xcite .",
    "given their ages , the present day main - sequence turnoff mass in globulars is about 0.8  @xmath0 , and therefore the bulk of their population has evolved through post main - sequence evolution , the majority having formed faint white dwarf stars . through almost 400 orbits of hubble space telescope imaging observations this decade , our team has uncovered the complete white dwarf cooling sequences of the two nearest globular clusters , m4 and ngc  6397 @xcite , and will target the third nearest cluster , 47  tuc , in cycle 17 ( go-11677 )",
    ". a shallower study of the massive globular omega  cen by @xcite and @xcite has successfully uncovered over 6500 remnants in this single cluster , roughly a quarter of the total known white dwarf population in the entire milky way from all other studies combined ( e.g. , eisenstein et  al .",
    "2006 , and subsequent sloan digital sky survey work ) .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of these clusters , extending to impressively faint magnitudes , are presented in figure  [ fig : globswds ] ( see also bedin et  al .",
    "2009 for a more recent acs study of m4 ) .",
    "the white dwarf cooling sequences of nearby globular clusters have been analyzed to independently ( e.g. , of main - sequence stars and turnoff morphology ) derive the distances and ages of the clusters @xcite , explore age variations between metal - rich and metal - poor systems using stars whose evolution is almost completely independent of metallicity @xcite , possibly suggest large fractions of helium - core white dwarfs produced through binary interactions @xcite , and hint that mass loss stages leading to the formation of white dwarfs may involve small asymmetric kicks @xcite .",
    "for each of these studies , the interpretation of the photometry to yield the results depends on knowledge of the mass of the brightest white dwarfs that are forming today in these old systems . yet , at present , _ no direct measurements of the masses of such population ii white dwarfs exists _ , although several indirect arguments suggest that the value should be @xmath3 @xmath4 0.53  @xmath0 . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , stellar evolution theory and our understanding of the maximum luminosity of red giant ( rg ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , as well as the luminosity of the horizontal branch ( hb ) ,",
    "predict that white dwarfs forming in globular clusters today should have 0.51 @xmath5 0.55  @xmath0 . the best observational verification of this theoretical prediction in the case of cluster white dwarfs was provided recently by @xcite , who reported the masses of white dwarfs in ngc  6752 to be 0.53  @xmath0 . however , their spectroscopic measurements were only of sufficient quality to yield the temperatures of the white dwarfs , and therefore the photometry from the cmd was leveraged to derive masses .",

    "we present the first results from a new study aimed at _ directly _",
    "( i.e. , purely from spectroscopic absorption line fitting ) measuring the masses of known population  ii white dwarfs in different environments .",
    "our goal is to target the brightest white dwarfs in the nearest globular star clusters ( such as m4 , ngc  6397 , and 47  tuc ) and in the halo field , with ground - based spectroscopic instruments on 810  m telescopes .",
    "the clusters listed above span an appreciable range in metallicity ( factor of 20 ) and are located at distances such that the brightest white dwarfs with @xmath6 = 10.5 have apparent magnitudes of @xmath7 = 22  24 .",
    "the faintness of these stars , crowding issues in the cluster , and the need to obtain high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra of the higher order balmer lines at @xmath8 4000  @xmath9 make this a difficult , but possible , project with current telescopes .",
    "below , we discuss the results from our first study , in which we target two dozen white dwarfs in m4 with the gemini / gmos and keck  i / lris multiobject spectrographs over several observing runs .",
    "the spectra for six of these stars , that are confirmed as cluster members and that have sufficient s / n to yield accurate mass measurements , are consistent with @xmath3 = 0.53 @xmath1 0.01  @xmath0 .",
    "the impact of this measurement for bettering our knowledge of stellar structure and evolution , and for dating halo globular clusters through white dwarf cooling theory , are discussed .",
    "an analysis of the remaining m4 spectra that did not yield masses , e.g. , to define the spectral types of population ii white dwarfs , is presented in the companion paper by @xcite .",
    "the deep hst imaging data of m4 illustrated in figure  [ fig : globswds ] ( left ) were collected with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) camera in 2001 as a part of go-8679 @xcite .",
    "the observations spanned a total of 123 orbits , in the broadband @xmath10 and @xmath11 filters , and were centered on a field located at ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) = ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , 2.4  pc ( 4.8@xmath16 ) s - e of the center of the cluster .",
    "although the hst photometry is very accurate , and there is no ambiguity on the membership of the white dwarfs , the bulk of the stars are too faint to be useful for spectroscopic follow up with modern day facilities . additionally , the wfpc2 field of view is 5.3  square arcminutes , about six times smaller than our ground based instruments , and therefore the spectroscopic program would be highly inefficient with just this input list of targets .",
    "below we first discuss supplemental imaging of these data with the gemini south telescope (  [ geminiimaging ] ) , followed by spectroscopic follow up (  [ geminispect ] ) . in   [ keckspect1 ] and [ keckspect ] , we discuss additional spectroscopic observations of m4 s white dwarf population with the keck  i telescope .",
    "we reobserved m4 with the gemini south telescope and gemini multiobject spectrograph ( gmos ) , anchoring the deep hst field near the south - eastern edge of the ground based image and placing shallower hst pointings near the western side .",
    "the gmos photometry , over a 5.5@xmath17 5.5@xmath16 area , has the added advantage that it extends continuous imaging into the denser region towards the center of m4 and therefore provides a higher density of targets down to a given magnitude limit .",
    "of course , crowding in the ground - based data prevents the targeting of white dwarfs near bright stars , and this increases in the direction of the cluster center .",

    "the spectra for these 18 stars , as well as an analysis of their spectral types is also presented in davis et  al .",
    "unfortunately , in order to determine reliable spectroscopic masses , characterization of h@xmath29 is crucial , and even h@xmath30 ( 3889  @xmath9 ) is very useful .",
    "the lack of flux at these wavelengths in our gemini data limited the utility of the gmos spectra for the central goals of this paper .",
    "although we could derive mass measurements from the spectra ( see  [ modelfit ] ) , the uncertainties are several tenths of a solar mass and therefore we decided to supplement these data with higher s / n observations , especially at bluer wavelengths .      with a sample of confirmed white dwarfs established from the gmos observations , we applied for keck  i telescope time to reobserve the targets using the lris multiobject spectrograph . not only does keck provide a larger aperture than gemini , but the spectrograph is very efficient in the blue and has an atmospheric dispersion corrector to minimize light loss at large airmasses ( this is important for this study since keck is in the north and m4 is in the south ) . given the similarities in the field of view ( lris has a 5@xmath31 7@xmath16 footprint ) , we simply used as many of the _ confirmed _ sample of white dwarfs from gemini as our input , as well as several additional redder stars in the same brightness range .",

    "keck / lris spectroscopic observations ( r.  m.  rich , pi ) of the single m4 mask proved challenging .",
    "half nights , required due to the low declination of m4 , were scheduled in 2005 june , 2007 april / july , and 2008 april , with the 2007 and 2008 observations benefiting from the lris atmospheric dispersion correction system .",
    "the multiple allocations were required due to poor weather that resulted in the loss of a significant number of scheduled hours .",

    "even these data are of highly variable quality , with seeing measurements ranging from 08 to over 20 . in these crowded fields ,",
    "our final spectra are dominated by a few of the contributions from the best nights .",
    "lris @xcite has a dichroic that splits the spectrum into two channels at @xmath45500  @xmath9 . on the blue side ,",

    "fitting the balmer lines of a white dwarf to model atmospheres involves reproducing multiple line profiles from h@xmath37 to higher order transitions @xcite .",

    "h@xmath30 , is the weakest and bluest ( at @xmath40 = 3889  @xmath9 ) , and therefore a spectrograph with high throughput in the blue is needed to characterize the feature accurately in faint stars .",
    "general details of the fitting technique used to derive @xmath39 and log  @xmath21 are provided in @xcite , and recent refinements to this method are given in @xcite .",
    "additional information on the fitting of white dwarf spectra similar to these observations , and taken with our instrumental setup , are presented in  6 of @xcite .",
    "specifically , the improved method to normalize the line profiles described in @xcite is used in our work .",
    "simultaneous fits of model atmospheres to all of the balmer lines , in each of the ten white dwarfs discussed above , are presented in figure  [ fig : wdspectram4 ] ( top - right ) . within each panel ,",
    "the absorption lines of a given white dwarf are arranged with h@xmath37 at the bottom , and successive higher order transitions on top .",
    "the model fits are shown as smooth red curves and are excellent in all cases .",
    "we also confirmed that the two anomalous features , small spikes caused by bad sky subtraction in the h@xmath37 line of wd  00 and 29 , do not affect the results of the fit .",
    "this line is least sensitive to changes in the gravity of the star .",
    "the output from the spectroscopic fits are the @xmath39 and log  @xmath21 for each star , which we summarize in table  2 .",
    "the masses of these ten stars ( @xmath3 ) are simply calculated by combining the measured surface gravity of the stars with the well established mass - radius relation for white dwarfs . in general ,",
    "most of the white dwarf masses are @xmath40.5  @xmath0 with an uncertainty of @xmath3410% .",
    "we also estimate both the cooling ages , @xmath41 , and the theoretical luminosity of each star by interpolating the @xmath39 and log  @xmath21 within evolutionary models similar to @xcite , but assuming a 50/50 carbon - oxygen core mix .",
    "our default calculations assume thick hydrogen layers with @xmath42 = @xmath43 = 10@xmath44 and helium layers of @xmath45 = 10@xmath46 , and are summarized in table  2 and discussed further below .",
    "we also tested the sensitivity of our results to models ( e.g. , wood 1995 ) with pure carbon cores and to models with very thin hydrogen layers ( e.g. , @xmath42 = 10@xmath47 ) .",
    "the results from these comparisons , for both the final remnant masses and the theoretical luminosities , are identical to our default values within the measured uncertainties in these properties ( which are small , see table  2 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the cooling ages of these bright , young white dwarfs are systematically larger in the pure c core models by 20  30% .    at the time of writing this paper , tremblay & bergeron ( 2009 )",
    "have just presented the first results from an improved calculation of the stark broadening of hydrogen lines in dense plasmas that are representative of white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "their new results , including non - ideal effects , suggest that the masses measured through the spectroscopic technique require a slight upward revision of 0.034  @xmath0 . as the temperatures of the stars using the new calculations are also slightly hotter ( e.g. , 1,000  2,000  k ) , the luminosities are unaffected .",
    "the full implications of this study have not yet been investigated and the dependency of this offset on mass is not well constrained . in the results that follow ,",
    "we have adjusted our default masses by @xmath480.034  @xmath0 to be consistent with these new calculations ( including the reported masses in table  2 ) .",
    "we have not corrected the individual @xmath39 and log  @xmath21 values by a common offset ( which would be approximately 1,500  k and 0.1  dex , respectively ) .",
    "the s / n of the ten white dwarfs in our sample is listed in column 8 of table  2 .",
    "this is calculated from the pseudo - continuum between the h@xmath13 and h@xmath29 balmer lines , at @xmath44030  @xmath9 .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel rms scatter is converted to a s / n per resolution element by multiplying by the square root of the number of pixels per fwhm ( six , in our case ) .",
    "the bulk of the stars have s / n = 40  50 , although a few are as low as @xmath430 and one object is above s / n = 60 .",
    "note , these s / n values should only be used as a relative ranking of the quality of each spectra , and are not indicative of the global s / n .",
    "we can see that , due to the throughput , the s / n decreases blueward of the wavelength at which we made this measurement .",
    "in figure  [ fig : synthetic ] ( top ) , we produce simulated white dwarf spectra over a range of s / n .",
    "these spectra have been convolved with a gaussian profile with 6  @xmath9 fwhm . directly comparing the quality of our data in figure  [ fig : wdspectram4 ] to these simulated spectra",
    ", we can conclude that most of our objects are better than the s / n = 30 case , and similar , if not better , than the s / n = 40 case . for the latter ,",
    "we generate a monte - carlo with 500 trials and fit each of these spectra in our fitting code .",
    "the prescription used in the fitting is identical to that for our actual white dwarfs , namely , the same models are used in the fit with five balmer lines .",
    "the results from this test are shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : synthetic ] .",
    "the input stellar parameters for the synthetic white dwarf are @xmath39 = 25,000  k , log  @xmath21 = 7.80 , and @xmath38 = 0.536  @xmath0 . from the distribution of recovered masses , we find @xmath49@xmath38@xmath50 = 0.54  @xmath0 with a dispersion of 0.06 @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we expect to measure the masses of our white dwarfs to roughly 10% precision based on this test , which agrees nicely with our reported uncertainties in mass ( see table  2 , column 5 ) . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : synthetic ] ,",
    "we extend the test above for other s / n values and plot the associated error from this fitting .",
    "thus far , we have established masses for ten white dwarfs in the m4 direction . as we have reported in previous spectroscopic studies of white dwarfs in star clusters , some fraction of the stars along these lines of sight",
    "are actually members of the field population and therefore need to be removed before discussing the mass distribution of bonafide members .",
    "the best method to establish such membership is through proper motion analysis , and we have such data from the hst overlap of a portion of our lris field ( see figure  [ fig : foot ] ) . out of these ten white dwarfs , we can confirm that wd  00 , 09 , 20 , and 24 are proper motion members ( as are wd  16 and 23 ; these are rejected from our sample based on the poor quality of the recovered spectra and/or contamination from a nearby neighbor  see  [ culling ] ) .",
    "this is not a surprising result since the proper motions were folded into the selection process to target white dwarfs in the region of overlap with our hst field .",
    "in addition to these five confirmed m4 white dwarfs , we note that the remaining objects in our sample closely follow the 0.5  @xmath0 cooling sequence , and are consistent in position in the cmd with the confirmed members .",
    "although we do not have proper motions for these stars , some of them are likely members of m4 .",
    "to distinguish members from non - members , we can use the theoretical luminosity of each star to calculate its distance modulus . any stars that have significantly discrepant values from the known distance of m4 , ( @xmath51)@xmath52 = 12.51 @xmath1 0.09 @xcite , should be eliminated from our sample as they likely represent field white dwarfs along the line of sight , binary white dwarfs , or possibly objects for which the spectroscopic fit is incorrect due to some unknown artifact in the spectrum .",
    "we compare the calculated distance modulus of each of our ten white dwarfs with the known m4 distance in figure  [ fig : mags ] .",
    "the 1@xmath53 uncertainty in the theoretical magnitude ( i.e. , from spectral fitting ) is plotted as a horizontal bar for each star , and the mean distance of m4 and @xmath12@xmath53 uncertainties are indicated with the solid and dashed lines .",
    "we can use the proper motion members of the cluster as a rough guide to establish the expected scatter of known members in this diagnostic .",
    "the calculated distances of three of the four proper motion members of the cluster , wd  00 , 20 , and 24 , are close to , but slightly larger than the distance of m4 , whereas the fourth star ( wd  09 ) appears to be 0.7  mags closer than the cluster . this object could therefore be a non - member that shares the proper motion of the cluster . alternatively ,",
    "if the object is a member , its overluminous nature may suggest an unresolved double degenerate in the cluster .",
    "we note that the mass derived from the spectrum of this star yields the unexpectedly high value of @xmath38 = 0.79  @xmath0 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "three additional white dwarfs are clearly members of the cluster , wd  04 , 06 , and 15 , whereas three other stars wd  02 , 05 , and 29 are possibly field white dwarfs .    to summarize , our final secure sample of singly evolved , m4 member white dwarfs includes three objects that are proper motion members ( wd  00 , 20 , and 24 ) and three objects which are on the cooling sequence and have the correct distance from spectral fitting ( wd  04 , 06 , and 15 ) .",
    "theory predicts that the masses of white dwarfs forming in old , population ii systems such as globular clusters are expected to be in the range 0.51 @xmath54 0.55  @xmath0 @xcite . as table  2 indicates , the six single white dwarfs that we have confirmed as members of m4 have masses that range from 0.50  0.59  @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainties in our mass measurements are all roughly the same , under 10% , and therefore the un - weighted mean mass of the sample of six white dwarfs is measured to be @xmath3 = 0.53 @xmath1 0.01  @xmath0 .",
    "the present day temperature of these cooling remnants is also well measured from our data .",
    "there is a group of four stars in our sample with @xmath7 @xmath4 22.6 ( @xmath6 = 10.1 ) and all have the same temperature , @xmath55 = 25,000  k. the two fainter stars , wd  00 and 20 , are cooler than this group by about 5,000  k , as expected .",
    "the surface gravities , log  @xmath21 , of all six stars are in the range log  @xmath21 = 7.68  7.95 . as mentioned earlier , the exact @xmath39 and log  @xmath21 values have not been adjusted to reflect the small corrections required by the new stark broadening calculations @xcite .",
    "our sampling of m4 cluster member white dwarfs in this study puts us in the fortunate situation of having characterized a group of four remnants at the same position on the cmd .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the mass difference between white dwarfs at the tip of the cooling sequence to those five magnitudes fainter at the limit of the hst study is only @xmath40.1  @xmath0 .",
    "these four white dwarfs , wd  04 , 06 , 15 , and 24 , differ in luminosity by just 0.07  mag , and therefore should have the same mass , and have evolved from stars with the same progenitor mass . the expected temperature range in this group of four stars",
    "should only be @xmath42% .",
    "as these differences are much smaller than our uncertainties , we can verify our mean mass measurement of m4 white dwarfs by creating a composite white dwarf spectrum , with very high s / n , from the coaddition of these individual spectra .",
    "@xcite have shown that for unresolved double degenerate systems , the atmospheric parameters derived from assuming a single star are in fact an average of the parameters of both components of the system .",
    "therefore , spectra with identical gravities should yield the same average gravity in a coaddition as compared to the true individual values .",
    "such a coaddition has the advantage that the resulting fit will be minimally influenced by any artifact affecting a given balmer line in one spectrum ( e.g. , presence of a cosmic ray ) .",
    "this method has several disadvantages as well , for example , the spectral lines in the composite may be artificially blurred if the wavelength solution is not well determined in each of the individual spectra .",
    "we stress that this test is only intended as a verification of our results and should not be attempted in samples where the mass variation between individual white dwarfs is non - negligible ( e.g. , similar studies in younger clusters ) .    the composite spectrum from this analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : composite ] ( top ) , and exhibits a s / n @xmath4 100 at @xmath40 = @xmath44030  @xmath9 .",

    "the total integrated post main - sequence mass loss of low mass stars in old population ii systems will be @xmath434% .",
    "theoretically , there is an expected lower limit to the masses of carbon - oxygen core white dwarfs .",

    "our first observational constraint from a half dozen white dwarfs in this single star cluster suggests the actual remnant masses are just slightly larger than the minimum core mass ( with a slight extrapolation ) .",
    "this implies that the progenitors of such low mass stars had just enough mass to experience thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch and that the cores of these stars will not grow appreciably during this evolution .",
    "as m4 is a typical population  ii system in terms of its old age and low metallicity , it is reasonable to assume that these trends may extend to stars that are presently in similar phases of stellar evolution both in the general field halo population and in other globular clusters with similar properties to m4 .",
    "in addition to extending the initial - final mass mapping to lower masses , m4 represents the first star cluster with a significantly sub - solar metallicity in which white dwarf masses have been measured .",
    "the mean metallicity of the cluster is [ fe / h ] = @xmath201.10 @xcite , 13 times more metal - poor than the bulk of the open clusters used to define the relation and 40 times more metal - poor than the metal - rich system ngc  6791 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath480.40 , peterson & green 1998 ) .",
    "for this cluster , after accounting for the new stark broadening calculations discussed earlier , @xcite actually measured a mean mass for nine white dwarfs of @xmath3 = 0.46 @xmath1 0.06 @xmath0 , much lower than expected .",
    "as they show , the bulk of these white dwarfs contain helium - cores , after evolving through a channel involving intense mass loss on the red giant branch , likely driven by the high metallicity of the cluster .",
    "the single data point shown in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] is based on the only clearly non he - core white dwarf in that sample , and does not affect the discussion above .",
    "however , the results from ngc  6791 suggest strong dependencies of mass loss on metallicity , especially at super - solar metallicities .",
    "to date , we lack a good theoretical understanding of the dependence of post main - sequence mass loss on metallicity .",
    "the general expectation in evolutionary models is for more efficient transport of material outward from the star if the metallicity is higher , and therefore higher rates of mass loss .",
    "however , the exact treatment depends on the modeling of winds on the red giant branch and thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch ( e.g. , see weidemann  2000 and habing 1996 ) , phases of stellar evolution that are poorly understood .",
    "as @xcite summarizes , mass loss prescriptions along the red giant branch alone show very different behaviors with metallicity .",
    "for example , over a 1  dex metallicity change from [ fe / h ] = @xmath201.0 to 0.0 , the @xcite and @xcite laws predict that @xmath58@xmath59 should increase by @xmath340.05  @xmath0 whereas the @xcite and @xcite laws suggest @xmath58@xmath38 increases by 0.15  0.25  @xmath0 .    to qualitatively compare the dependence of mass loss in post main - sequence evolution with metallicity to these estimates , we can first parameterize the initial - final mass relation .",

    "the bounds on this relation range from the oldest open cluster white dwarf in ngc  6791 to the youngest white dwarfs in the pleiades , and therefore are @xmath56 = 1.1  6.5  @xmath0",
    ". a small extrapolation of the empirical relation to the mass of the present day turnoff in m4 ( e.g. , @xmath40.8  @xmath0 ) yields @xmath3 = 0.52 @xmath1 0.02  @xmath0 , which is therefore consistent ( at 1@xmath53 ) with our measured value of the masses of m4 s white dwarf population .",
    "these data therefore _ hint _ that mass loss rates have a weak or no dependence on metallicity , at least over the range extending from metal - poor populations such as m4 to roughly solar metallicity .",
    "interestingly , we know from our study of ngc  6791 that mass loss rates are strongly correlated with metallicity at extremely high [ fe / h ] , and therefore this may lead to an interesting shape for the empirical mass loss ",

    "of course , stronger conclusions will benefit greatly from additional observations of clusters spanning a wide range of metallicities , especially at the metal - poor end . for completion ,",

    "the present study serves to establish several of the input ingredients that are needed to make this measurement . for example ,",
    "knowledge of the masses and spectral types of white dwarfs , and the initial - final mass relation , are all required to fully model an observed white dwarf cooling sequence ( e.g. , hansen et  al .  2004 ; 2007 ) .",
    "for m4 , two recent studies have modeled the white dwarf cooling sequence using independent data sets , and both have concluded with similar ages ( however , see discussion below ) .",
    "first , @xcite used a full 2-d treatment of the white dwarf cooling sequence in the observed hst wfpc2 cmd ( i.e. , luminosity and color information are used ) , and just recently , @xcite have used a more simplified technique of age dating based solely on the luminosity function in newer and deeper acs data .",
    "an analysis of these studies illuminates several interesting choices relative to the findings in this paper :    * the present day mass of cluster white dwarfs forming today sets the normalization for the masses along the entire cooling sequence . in their modeling ,",
    "@xcite assume the mass at the tip to be 0.55  @xmath0 and @xcite assume 0.54  @xmath0 .",
    "as we have shown , the actual mass of white dwarfs at the bright end of the cooling sequence is only slightly lower at 0.53  @xmath0 , and therefore the mass distribution ( and hence cooling rates ) along the entire cooling sequence are not very different from the assumptions in these studies .",
    "* hydrogen ( da ) and helium ( db ) atmosphere white dwarfs have different cooling rates , and so the fraction of stars cooling with these spectral types leads to structure in the luminosity and color function that must be modeled correctly to infer the age of the population from white dwarf cooling theory . for m4 ,",

    "@xcite treated the fraction of db white dwarfs as a free parameter and found the best fit to yield an upper limit of 40% ( good fits were obtained as long as more than 60% of the white dwarfs are da ) , whereas @xcite choose an arbitrary value of 30% ( e.g. , the field disk ratio ) . * the initial - final mass relation is required to properly evolve the progenitor stars on to the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "the normalization and form of the initial - final mass relation adopted in both of these studies ( e.g. , wood 1992 ) , is based on empirical constraints from solar metallicity data points at higher masses , and a theoretical anchor at low masses .",
    "this can now be updated to our new result given earlier .",
    "we encourage future theoretical modeling efforts to make full use of this new information in their analysis , preferably on the newer acs imaging data of m4 .",
    "of course , the white dwarf models themselves should also be updated with new physical insights .",
    "for example , the contribution to the opacity of cool white dwarfs from the far red wing of the ly@xmath12 line ( kowalski 2007 ) alone can yield ages of globular clusters ( e.g. , ngc  6397 ) that are higher by @xmath40.5  gyr ( kowalski 2007 ; b.  hansen 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "we noted above that the @xcite and @xcite studies concluded with similar white dwarf cooling ages for m4 .",
    "formally , @xcite reported an age of 12.1  gyr ( 2@xmath53 lower limit of 10.3  gyr ) and @xcite measured an age of 11.6 @xmath1 0.6  gyr ( internal errors ) . a deeper look at these two studies suggests they are , in fact , grossly _",
    "inconsistent _ with one another given differences in white dwarf cooling models and uncertainties in the cluster distance modulus .",
    "as our present work is closely linked to obtaining very accurate absolute age measurements of globular clusters ( through the study of white dwarfs ) , we briefly summarize these two studies below and highlight the respective assumptions and differences that are being made .    in the @xcite study",
    ", the authors compare their data to three sets of models and adopt a distance to m4 based on the well established technique of subdwarf distance fitting .",
    "they find @xmath62 = 1.73 @xmath1 0.10  kpc for m4 ( e.g. , richer et  al .",
    "1997 ) , which is identical to independent distance measurements for the cluster from the baade - wesselink distance using the m4 rr lyrae stars ( @xmath62 = 1.73 @xmath1 0.01  kpc , liu & janes 1990 ) and from astrometry ( @xmath62 = 1.72 @xmath1 0.14  kpc , peterson et  al .",
    "1995 ) . at present",
    ", it appears the latter estimate is the most secure . for the subdwarf measurement ,",
    "the comparison was based on pre - hipparcos parallaxes , and for some other clusters , a calculation with post - hipparcos parallaxes indicates a longer distance by @xmath40.2  mags than initially estimated ( gratton et  al .",
    "similarly , the baade - wesselink method yields luminosities for m4 s rr lyrae stars that are fainter by @xmath40.2  mags as compared to the @xmath6[fe / h ] relation derived by gratton et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) for clusters with low extinction ( using post - hipparcos main - sequence fitting techniques ) .",
    "unfortunately , re - deriving the distance to m4 using any photometric technique is problematic given the very high extinction along the line of sight ( @xmath63 @xmath2 1 ) , the variation in @xmath63 across the face of the cluster , and the non - standard shape of the extinction curve along this line of sight ( which passes through the scorpius - ophiucus dark cloud complex  vrba , coyne , & tapia 1993 ) .",
    "irrespective of the adopted distance ( although see below ) , @xcite find that the white dwarf cooling age they derive for m4 from their own models ( e.g. , hansen 1999 ) is consistent with that measured using the @xcite models , however they rule out the @xcite models which yield ages that are older than the universe .",
    "therefore , this suggests that , for the same distance modulus and data set , simply changing the white dwarf model yields an absolute age difference of 2  gyr .",
    "in the recent @xcite study , the authors use only the @xcite white dwarf models , and still conclude with an age similar to that derived by @xcite .",
    "the difference is actually reflected in the distance to m4 ; @xcite use a much larger ( i.e. , 15% ) value of @xmath62 = 1.98  kpc .",
    "this value is formally inconsistent with the three independent studies above .",
    "@xcite measure the distance to m4 by simply fitting a single isochrone of approximately the correct metallicity to the turnoff and horizontal branch . in principle , this method can of course yield the distance to any stellar population with a measured turnoff , however it has almost always been avoided for a large number of reasons .",
    "first , and most importantly , there are uncertainties in both the microphysics built into the stellar evolution models ( e.g. , opacities , equation of state effects , and nuclear reaction rates ) and in the treatment of processes that do not come from first principles ( e.g. , convection , core - rotation , diffusion , gravitational settling , etc . ) . because of these unknowns , simply adopting an isochrone from another groups models would lead to a different measured distance modulus for the cluster ( e.g. , different models predict different horizontal branch luminosities ) .",
    "second , such comparisons of data and models to yield distances require transformation of the model from the theoretical to the observational plane , resulting in another source of error . finally , in this specific case , this comparison does not alleviate any of the aforementioned uncertainties related to our lack of knowledge of the reddening and extinction along this line of sight . in the end ,",
    "the application of the @xcite models and the longer distance modulus derived by @xcite effectively offset each other , yielding a derived age similar to that of @xcite .",
    "summarizing , there are clearly both intrinsic differences in white dwarf models calculated by different groups and there is a lack of consensus on the correct distance to m4 . for the former , increased testing of the white dwarfs models on star clusters with well known fundamental parameters ( e.g. , distance , metallicity , and foreground reddening ) are sure to resolve the correct prescriptions . for the latter",
    ", it appears that only the @xcite astrometric measurement is free of the unknown reddening and extinction laws along this line of sight , and therefore should be preferred . until these differences are unambiguously resolved ( e.g. ,",
    "the space interferometry mission could directly measure the distance to m4 to within a few percent ) , the error budget from these uncertainties will remain large and the new physical constraints on masses , spectral types , and the initial - final mass relation are secondary to the analysis .",
    "of course , if the properties of bright white dwarfs in other population ii systems are similar to m4 , the new results can have immediate significance on those studies .",
    "this is especially exciting given the remarkable data set that has been presented for ngc  6397 by @xcite and will soon be available for 47  tuc ( h.  richer , cycle 17 acs / wfc3 proposal go-11677 ) .",
    "the mass measurement of white dwarfs in a globular cluster provides important leverage to the use of these stars as distance calibrators .",
    "although the white dwarf cooling sequence is fainter than the bright part of the main - sequence in a star cluster , uncovering the sequence can offer several advantages over canonical techniques involving main - sequence distance fitting .",
    "for example , the location of the bulk of the white dwarf cooling sequence in a cmd does not depend on the metallicity or age of the population , or on any of the other systematics that plague main - sequence evolution ( e.g. , convection theory ) .",
    "however , the location does depend on mass ( e.g. , wood  1995 ) , with a 0.1  @xmath0 difference translating to a @xmath58(mag ) = 0.25 shift ( i.e. , a 12% distance offset ) .",
    "so , first , a simple offset can now be calculated to correct the location of any local calibrating sample of white dwarfs with parallax measurements ( usually 0.60  @xmath0 for field white dwarfs ) to the expected location of 0.53  @xmath0 stars .",
    "following this , a straightforward comparison with the apparent luminosity of the globular cluster white dwarf cooling sequence can yield the distance to the population ( e.g. , see renzini et  al .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to actually make this measurement and independently derive the distance of m4 given the aforementioned uncertainties in the slope of the extinction curve along this line of sight .",
    "however , the true distances of other clusters with well constrained reddenings and extinctions can be easily calculated from their cooling sequences and the new mass measurements .",
    "we have presented the first directly determined spectroscopic mass measurements of white dwarfs that are known to be population ii members .",
    "our measurements suggest that the final remnant mass at the tip of the white dwarf cooling sequence in the globular cluster m4 is @xmath3 = 0.53 @xmath1 0.01  @xmath0 , in nice agreement with expectations based on stellar evolution theory .",
    "these results suggest that low mass population ii stars will lose @xmath434% of their mass through post main - sequence stellar evolution . if , in fact , all milky way globular clusters have the same age , then this mass loss rate should be applicable to the evolution of stars in all but the most metal - rich galactic globular clusters .",
    "we use this measurement to first extend the initial - final mass relation of stars to the lowest possible limit , given the age of the universe .",
    "this single observation also hints that mass loss rates are not significantly different for metal poor stars when compared to solar metallicity stars of the same mass .",
    "finally , we offer several pieces of new input that are required to measure more accurate white dwarf cooling ages of globular clusters in the galactic halo .",
    "imaging observations of globular clusters with ground and space based telescopes have now uncovered thousands of white dwarfs in population ii clusters ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : globswds ] ) .",
    "the science that results from these purely photometric surveys is greatly enhanced with spectroscopic follow up , which we have shown can yield the spectral types of the remnants @xcite , the mapping of initial to final mass , and the mass at the tip of the observed cooling sequence ( and therefore a calibration for the masses along the entire cooling sequence ) .",
    "all of the nearest globular clusters are in the southern hemisphere , and given their larger distances compared to m4 , an extension of this work to these systems will require superior blue sensitivity and throughput , and much larger allocations of spectroscopic time on 8-meter class telescopes ( e.g. , see moehler et  al .",
    "future white dwarf spectroscopy in these clusters will benefit greatly from a 30-m telescope with a multiobject spectrograph with the bluest sensitivity .",
    "such a telescope would not only allow a direct measurement of the mass loss rates in an expanded set of open and globular clusters , but would permit the first initial - final mass relations to be built from observations of a set of white dwarfs in a _",
    "single _ cluster .",
    "deep spectroscopy of white dwarfs over a range in luminosity ( and therefore mass ) can be engaged in a given cluster , minimizing the systematics introduced by metallicity variations in samples of clusters .",
    "fortunately , the nearest three globular clusters also sample a wide range in metallicity ( e.g. , a factor of 20 from ngc  6397 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath202.0 to 47  tuc at [ fe / h ] = @xmath200.7 ) , and therefore the dependence of mass loss on metallicity can be probed in detail with such observations .",
