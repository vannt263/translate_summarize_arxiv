    "this sharp decline in both @xmath30  and  is a surprising and profound result . before discussing its origin , we emphasize that the evolution must occur at all column densities of the dlas such that the shape of @xmath0  remains invariant .",
    "therefore , one should focus on processes that affect the inner and outer regions of disks together .",
    "the results of the previous section have far reaching implications for the nature and role of disks and for the processes of galaxy formation .",
    "let us begin with the invariance in the shape of @xmath0 . in terms of statistical power ,",
    "the shape of @xmath0  is dominated by systems with low @xmath24  values and the primary result is that the ` faint - end slope ' of @xmath0  is invariant . in the local universe ,",
    "low @xmath24  sightlines correspond to the outer regions of disks .",
    "we draw the inference that galaxies have self - similar surface density profiles in the outer disk at all cosmic times .    in the most straightforward , analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath0 is determined by the radial surface density profiles , which in turn are set by the total mass of the system , the angular momentum distribution of the galaxy , the gas mass fraction , etc .",
    "this simple picture is modified by spiral density waves , warps , galaxy mergers , the detailed nature of ism clumping , molecular cloud formation , and feedback from supernovae and/or agn activity .",
    "all of these processes are expected to vary with time , especially the characteristic mass of galaxies .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ fig : fnhi]b suggest that the outer regions of disks are not especially sensitive to these processes nor to the underlying dark matter halo mass .",
    "we note that this is actually a prediction of viscous models of galactic disk formation @xcite .",
    "we await explorations of this topic witin the context of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "secular and feedback processes may be expected to have greater effect on the gas toward the inner regions , i.e.  at the highest surface densities .",
    "we have also searched for variations in @xmath0  at large @xmath24 , but identify none . at the 95@xmath81 c.l .",
    ", all of the redshift intervals have @xmath0  distributions consistent with a break column density of @xmath82 . furthermore , restricting the frequency distributions to @xmath83 , all give satisfactory ks - test probabilities .",
    "we conclude there is no evolution at these column densities , but caution that the full sample includes only 105  dlas .",
    "the data also reveal , for the first time , that @xmath0  is steeper than @xmath84 beyond the break .",
    "this can not be attributed to projection alone ( which predictes @xmath84 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we associate the steeper drop to the conversion of atomic gas to molecules @xcite .        now consider the sharp decrease in the total comoving covering fraction and mass density from @xmath6 to 2 ( figure  [ fig : moments ] , table  [ tab : newsumm ] ) .",
    "one s initial reaction may be to interpret this decline in terms of active star - formation , i.e.  the conversion of the gas in dlas to stars via _ in situ _ star formation .",
    "this interpretation is problematic for several reasons .",
    "first , one expects star formation to mainly influence gas at high surface densities ; this is revealed , in part , by the form of the schmidt law , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the sfr per unit area and @xmath87 is mass surface density @xcite .",
    "but the invariant shape of @xmath0 suggests that _ in situ _ star formation in dlas is unlikely to consume gas according to the schmidt law .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]a , which shows how an initial single power - law approximation for @xmath0 steepens with time if stars form according to the schmidt law @xcite .",
    "we find that the absence of changes in the shape of @xmath0 implies that the star - formation efficiency is less than 1/10 that in local galaxies .",
    "second , @xcite used the infrequent detection of extended , low surface - brightness galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field to set an upper limit on the comoving sfr density of sfr density ,  @xmath88 .",
    "we used this limit to set an upper limit on the decrease in @xmath89 due to _ in situ _ star formation .",
    "we fitted a conservative expression for to be consistent with ( a ) this upper limit at z @xmath20 3 and ( b ) observations of star - forming galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath12=[0,8 ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we then computed the decrease in @xmath90 by integrating from @xmath12=6 to @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting dip in @xmath91 is shown as the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]b .",
    "clearly the decrease in @xmath89 predicted by _ in situ _ star formation is too small to account for the factor of two decrease observed .",
    "specifically , the total mass density of stars formed in - situ in disks is less than a few percent of the observed  at @xmath6 .",
    "third , to markedly change the covering fraction of the disks , _ in situ _ star - formation would have to lower @xmath77 of the disks below the dla criterion . at the dla threshold ,",
    "star formation is likely very weak ( if not absent ) and should not affect this gas .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that _ in situ _ star formation on its own is insufficient to explain the sharp decline in @xmath30  and  at high @xmath12 . by similar arguments ,",
    "one rules out an interpertation where the majority of gas is simply conveted into molecular gas .",
    "furthermore , observational biases ( e.g.  dust obscuration , gravitational lensing ) are most important at high @xmath24  values and can be ruled out as dominant factors .",
    "finally , the extragalactic uv background ( euvb ) will modify the distribution of neutral gas in the outer parts of disks but the dla threshold is sufficiently large that variations in the euvb should play only a minor role for @xmath30  and a negligble one for  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand it is possible that the gas in dlas fuels star formation @xcite .",
    "in that case the schmidt law would not apply to dla gas .",
    "rather , secular processes could drive the gas to the center where it would be consumed by star formation in compact star - forming regions . to compute the decrease in we fitted analytic functions to the intrinsic values of derived by @xcite and computed by integrating the under the curve .",
    "the results are well - matched to the data at @xmath12=[2.5,4.5 ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : models]b ) .",
    "although we obtained this fit by arbitrarily increasing the `` initial '' at @xmath12=6 by 10 @xmath81 above our highest data point at @xmath12=4.0 , the decrease in predicted by this model for provides a good match to the data for a wide range of initial values of .",
    "however , the model breaks down at @xmath92 , where the predicted falls below the constant value set by at @xmath12=[0,2.4 ] .",
    "but the levelling off of at @xmath12 @xmath93 2.4 , could be explained by delayed infall of gas from the igm at a rate that balances gas consumption by star formation , a phenomenon observed in some numerical simulations of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "of course , a crucial challenge to this idea is how to transport gas from the extended regions comprising dlas to the center , i.e. , by a factor of 15 or more in radius ( cf .",
    "* ) , without affecting the shape of @xmath0 , but by reducing its normalization by a factor of two .",
    "the other extremum is that the sharp decline in covering fraction and mass density of disks results from ` violent ' feedback processes . by violent ,",
    "we envision processes that altogether remove the gas from a galaxy .",
    "these may include agn activity , galactic - scale winds , tidal effects , and ram - pressure stripping . to match the observed evolution in @xmath30  and",
    ", one would require that approximately half of the galaxies exhibiting disks at @xmath79 have lost their gas by @xmath14 .",
    "this implies a dramatic evolution in the fraction of -rich to poor galaxies in the 2gyr interval centered at @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting galaxies , if unable to accrete new gas for subsequent star formation , would passively evolve into ` red and dead ' galaxies .",
    "we speculate , therefore , that @xmath95 marks the formation epoch for the formation of stars in the ancestors of modern , early - type galaxies .",
    "the data in figure  [ fig : moments ] provides another surprising result .",
    "the red bands in the figure show @xmath96 estimates of @xmath30  and , as inferred from 21 cm observations @xcite .",
    "we find that  at @xmath97 matches the present - day value .",
    "a brazen , but reasonable , assertion by interpolation is that  has not evolved over the past 10gyr of our universe .",
    "if confirmed , this result has several important implications .",
    "first , if processes destroy disks below @xmath14 , these must be matched by the formation of new galaxies .",
    "because the assembly of dark matter halos of galactic - scale masses ( @xmath98 ) is expected to be nearly complete at @xmath99 , we contend that the destruction of disks is also nearly complete .",
    "second , the accretion of gas into existing disks must be balanced by the the consumption of that gas into stars and/or its removal from the galaxy by feedback processes .",
    "this suggests that disks play a special , but subserviant role in the formation of stars .",
    "in essence , disks represent a bias level of gas that is a necessary but insufficient condition for star formation . in this scenario , the global star formation rate at any given epoch is driven predominantly by the accretion rate of fresh material onto existing disks , an inference also drawn from cosmological simulations of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "it further suggests that disks have been critically unstable to star formation over the past 10  billion years and possibly all of cosmic time .    before concluding , we comment briefly on current estimates of @xmath0  and  at @xmath100 where absorption has been used to identify dla candidates @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : fnhi]b , we present the cumulative @xmath0  distribution for dlas derived in this fashion .",
    "the @xmath100 sample exhibits a higher incidence of dlas with @xmath83 than at @xmath13 or @xmath78 .",
    "if taken at face value , the results indicate that disks at @xmath100 have a higher cross - section at column densities @xmath101 than @xmath102 .",
    "it is unlikely that there is a single galaxy in the universe with this characteristic , much less the integrated population of disks . as such",
    ", we conclude that the @xmath100 results suffer from a statistical fluke or an unfortunate observational bias . if we demand that @xmath0  at @xmath100 follow the same shape as at @xmath13 and @xmath78",
    ", then we estimate a  value consistent with no evolution over the past 10gyr .",
    "the observations presented here will be supplemented by future data releases of the sdss and next generation surveys .",
    "the key open empirical issues include : ( i ) is there even a mild evolution in the break column density with redshift ?",
    "( ii ) what is the functional form of @xmath0  beyond the break ? ( iii ) what are the values of these quantities at @xmath103 ? of greater interest will be to compare the observational constrainst presented here against theoretical models for the build - up and evolution of disks over cosmic time .",
