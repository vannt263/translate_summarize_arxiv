    "one of the ways in which a gauge theory with massless charged matter can arise in type iia , m - theory , and f - theory is known as geometrical engineering . in this framework ,",
    "gauge theory at low energy arises from co - dimension four singular surfaces in the compactification manifold @xcite and charged matter arises as isolated points ( curves in f - theory ) on these surfaces over which the singularity is enhanced .",
    "katz and vafa @xcite constructed explicit examples of local geometry which would give rise to different representations of various gauge groups .",
    "their work was presented explicitly in the language of type iia or f - theory , but the general results have been shown to apply much more broadly to m - theory as well @xcite .",
    "the picture of matter and gauge theory arising from pure geometry via singular structures has been used very fruitfully in much of the progress of m - theory phenomenology . in @xcite witten engineered an interesting phenomenological model in m - theory which could possibly solve the higgs doublet - triplet splitting problem ; this model was explored in great detail together with friedmann in @xcite .",
    "there , the explicit topology of the ade - singular surface and the relative locations of all the isolated conical singularities was motivated by phenomenology ",
    "the description of the geometry of the singularities themselves was taken for granted .",
    "unlike model building with d - branes , for example , geometrical engineering as it has been understood provides little information about the number , type , and relative locations of the many different singularities needed for any phenomenological model .",
    "this information must either come _ a posteriori _ from phenomenological success or via duality to a concrete string model .",
    "but recent successes in m - theory model building ( for example , @xcite ) motivate a new look at how to describe the relative structure of singularities  at least locally  within the framework of geometrical engineering itself .    in this paper , we reduce the apparent arbitrariness of the number and relative positions of the singularities required by low - energy phenomenology by showing how they can be obtained from deforming a smaller number of singularities in a more unified model . in section [ geo ]",
    "we review the ingredients of geometrical engineering as described in @xcite .",
    "the basic framework is then interpreted in a novel way in section [ modelbuilding ] to relate manifolds with matter singularities to those with more or less symmetry .",
    "the idea is used explicitly to deform an @xmath0 grand unified model into the standard model .    to be clear , as in @xcite our results apply only strictly to @xmath1 models from type iia compactifications or @xmath2 models from f - theory compactifications - fibrations over @xmath3 .",
    "if the @xmath3-base is fibred over @xmath4 as an @xmath5 bundle , for example , then the total space will be a calabi - yau four - fold upon which f - theory can be compactified , giving rise to an @xmath2 theory . ]",
    "; but we suspect that this framework has an m - theory analogue in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "in the framework of geometrical engineering the compactification manifold is described as a fibration of ( singular ) @xmath6 surfaces over a base space of appropriate dimension .",
    "the collection of point - like ( co - dimension four ) singularities of the @xmath6 fibres would then be a co - dimension four surface in the compactified manifold , giving rise to gauge theory of type corresponding to the singularities on each @xmath6 fibre .",
    "table [ orbifolds ] lists polynomials in @xmath7 whose solutions can be ( locally ) taken to be the fibres for each corresponding gauge group .",
    "one of the strengths of this framework is its generality : the local geometry is specified in terms of the @xmath6 fibres , so that the description applies equally well to compactifications in type iia , m - theory , and f - theory  the difference being the dimension of the space over which the surfaces in table [ orbifolds ] are fibred .",
    ".[orbifolds]hypersurfaces in @xmath7 giving rise to the desired orbifold singularities . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     to obtain massless charged matter , however , additional structure is necessary .",
    "specifically , at isolated points ( in type iia or m - theory ) on the co - dimension four singular surface , the type of singularity of the @xmath6 fibres must be enhanced by one rank .",
    "mathematically , this requires that one can describe how the various polynomials in table [ orbifolds ] can be deformed into each other ; and the possible two - dimensional deformations have been classified @xcite .",
    "for example , to describe the embedding of a massless @xmath8 of @xmath0 in type iia , you would need to start with a @xmath6-fibred calabi - yau where each of the fibres are of the type giving rise to @xmath0 gauge theory . from table",
    "[ orbifolds ] we see that these four - dimensional fibres are locally the set of solutions to the equation @xmath9 in @xmath7 .",
    "now , to obtain matter in the @xmath8 representation , there would need to be an isolated point somewhere on the two - dimensional base space where the fibre is enhanced to @xmath10 , @xcite .",
    "a description of the local geometry can be given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a complex coordinate on the base over which the @xmath6 s are fibred .",
    "notice that when the equation describes precisely the fibre which would have given rise to @xmath10 gauge theory if it were fibred over the entire base manifold .",
    "however , because it is the fibre only over the origin in the complex @xmath12-plane , there is no @xmath10 gauge theory .",
    "equation ( [ su6tosu5 ] ) is said to describe the ` resolution ' @xmath13 , which is found to give rise to @xmath0 gauge theory at low energy with a single massless @xmath8 at @xmath14 .",
    "this and many other explicit examples of such resolutions and the matter representations obtained are given in @xcite .",
    "one subtlety which makes the description above not automatically apply to m - theory constructions , however , is that in equation ( [ su6tosu5 ] ) the complex parameter @xmath12 is two - dimensional : taken as a coordinate over which the @xmath6 surfaces are fibred , it gives rise to a six - dimensional compactification manifold . in m - theory",
    ", co - dimension four singularities are three - dimensional and chiral matter would live at isolated points on these three dimensional orbifold singularities .",
    "so in m - theory the resolution would need a three - dimensional deformation .",
    "morally , the structure is identical to that described in equation ( [ su6tosu5 ] ) , but the parameter @xmath12 must be upgraded to describe three - dimensional deformations .",
    "this can be done in terms of hyper - khler quotients .",
    "we suspect that all the resolutions described explicitly for type iia here and in @xcite can be upgraded to three - dimensional deformations needed in m - theory , and in many cases these generalizations have already been given @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is that distinct conical singularities on a surface with some gauge symmetry can be deformed into each other in ways analogous to unification ; and conversely , that a description of a single matter field in a unified theory can be ` unfolded ' into distinct matter fields in a theory of lower gauge symmetry . because the tools used to perform these unification - like deformations are precisely the same as those used to describe the singularities themselves",
    ", some care must be taken to avoid unnecessary confusion .",
    "we will start by reinterpreting the tools used above to engineer charged matter , and then we will use both interpretations simultaneously to construct explicit examples of the geometric analogue to unified model building .    consider again the resolution @xmath13 described by @xmath15 where we have replaced @xmath16 from equation ( [ su6tosu5 ] ) to make a interpretative distinction that will soon become clear .",
    "we propose to momentarily discuss pure gauge theory and ignore any description of matter . with this in mind , take a fixed ( real ) two - dimensional neighborhood over which _ every _ point is fibred by the solutions to equation ( [ gsu6tosu5 ] ) for any fixed value of @xmath17 . because the fibres are the same everywhere on the manifold , there is no matter : for any @xmath17 the geometry would give rise to pure gauge theory at low energy . for @xmath18 solutions to equation ( [ gsu6tosu5 ] )",
    "are @xmath0 fibres and so the compactification manifold would give rise to pure @xmath0 .",
    "however , when @xmath19 the fibres are all @xmath10 and so the low - energy theory would be pure @xmath10 .",
    "therefore @xmath17 is a ` global ' parameter which deforms the gauge content of the theory such that for arbitrary values of @xmath18 the theory is pure @xmath0 and for @xmath19 it is pure @xmath10 . that this deformation is ` smooth ' is apparent at least when @xmath18 .",
    "an obvious question to ask is how this framework applies when conical singularities are present .",
    "we will show that when the ade - surface singularity changes because of some complex structure modulus such as @xmath17 above , the conical singularities giving rise to charged matter ( often ) behave as one would expect from unified model building intuition .",
    "this is best demonstrated with explicit examples .",
    "suppose that the singular @xmath6 surfaces are fibred over a two - dimensional base space with local complex coordinate @xmath12 . and",
    "say the four - dimensional fibre over the point @xmath12 is given by the solutions to @xmath20 for a given value of @xmath17 , which is now to be interpreted as a complex structure modulus deforming the entire local geometry near @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath19 the geometry is of course identical to our previous description of @xmath13 and so the theory would be @xmath0 with a single massless @xmath8 located at @xmath14 .",
    "consider now @xmath17 to be fixed at some non - zero value .",
    "the gauge theory is then @xmath21 : for generic values of @xmath12 , the fibres given by equation ( [ 5tosm ] ) have two singular points , at and , and so the union of these points over the base manifold coordinatized by @xmath12 will be two distinct , two - dimensional singular surfaces : one giving rise to @xmath22 and the other @xmath23 .",
    "these surfaces become coincident as a single @xmath0 surface when @xmath19 .",

    "the base space over which solutions to ( [ 5tosm ] ) are fibred are indicated by the black line .",

    "this resolution , @xmath35 , gives rise to a @xmath31 of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "following the same idea as before , the deformation of this singularity into @xmath36 is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath17 is again interpreted as a complex structure modulus deforming the geometry near the singularity .",

    "notice that the relative positions of the three isolated ( conical ) singularities are fixed by @xmath17.[so10doubleres ] ]",
    "one of the primary reasons why geometrical engineering had not been more widely used phenomenologically is because the number , type , and relative locations of the singularities giving rise to various matter fields were explicitly _ ad hoc _ : the inherent local framework prevented relationships between distinct singularities from being discussed . in this paper , we have shown a framework in which these questions can be addressed concretely , systematically reducing the arbitrariness of these models .",
    "of course , the local nature of geometrical engineering is still inherent in this framework , and continues to prevent us from addressing questions about the global structure such as stability , quantum gravity , and the quantization of seemingly continuous parameters like @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the spirit of @xcite , we think that local engineering is a good step toward realistic string phenomenology , and may perhaps offer new insights .",
    "in this paper we explicitly illustrated the geometric unfolding of the matter content of an @xmath0 grand unified model into the standard model .",
    "but the procedure can easily be generalized .",
    "it is not difficult to see how this will work for a more unified theory .",
    "for example , one can envision how an entire family could unfold out of a single @xmath44 resolution ( which starts as a @xmath45 of @xmath33 ) , or how all three families of the standard mode could be unfolded out of a single @xmath46 or @xmath47 resolution .",
    "however , these examples require more sophisticated tools of analysis , and so we have chosen to describe these in a forthcoming work .",
    "this work originated from discussions with malcolm perry whose insights drove this work forward in its earliest steps .",
    "the author also appreciates helpful discussions , comments , and suggestions from herman verlinde , sergei gukov , gordon kane , edward witten , paul langacker , bobby acharya , dmitry malyshev , matthew buican , piyush kumar , and konstantin bobkov ."
