    "the bcs theory is considered as a conventional theory of superconductivity at a microscopic level , where bosonic excitations like phonons or spin fluctuations play the role of mediators in the formation of cooper pairs and hence superconductivity occurs in a metallic state . in recent years many varieties of superconductors have been discovered which are unconventional .",
    "some examples are    1 .",

    "singlet and triplet pairings coexist , 5 .",
    "strong electronic correlations dominated so - called non - fermi liquid state , believed to be found in high @xmath5 oxides and in heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , there is another class of unconventional superconducting systems , the novel multiband superconductors . in these systems",
    "two or more energy bands are cut by the fermi energy giving rise to multiple energy gaps with different magnitudes in the different fermi sheets .",
    "recent measurements of tunnelling , point - contact spectroscopy , angle - resolved photoemission and specific heat provide clear evidence of multiple gap structures .",
    "examples of such systems are mgb@xmath3 , rni@xmath3b@xmath3c ( r= lu , y ) , 2h - nbse@xmath3 and many in the pnictide feas family .",
    "the bcs theory of superconductivity has been generalised to multiband systems . in one of our recent publications",
    "we have given a brief appraisal of the history of multiband bcs theory @xcite and have presented a theory of the time - reversal symmetry broken state in the bcs formalism .",
    "we are reminded that a phenomenological theory of superconductivity by ginzburg and landau [ gl ] was developed before the proposal of microscopic bcs theory .",
    "the gl approach is a successful theory of phase transitions with many practical applications .",
    "the basis of this theory rests on two approximations correct around the critical temperature ( @xmath5 ) ( i ) the order parameter , @xmath6 , is small near @xmath5 and ( ii ) @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . despite these limitations",
    "there is a myth that the gl theory applies not only around @xmath5 , rather it is useful for much lower temperatures . in early years soon after the appearance of bcs theory , gorkov @xcite established the equivalence of the bcs energy gap , @xmath9 , with the order parameter of the gl theory for single band superconductors with the above conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) .    in multiband superconductors",
    "the equivalence has been investigated by many authors ( see a brief review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in both theories ( bcs and gl )",
    "an additional interaction term appears due to interband interaction , which is recognised as the josephson term .",
    "this term is the lowest order coupling between the gaps ( in bcs ) and order parameter ( in gl ) in the different bands .",
    "the presence of josephson terms in multiband superconductors causes several problems in the gorkov type derivations . recently in a series of papers vagov and coworkers @xcite have made detailed analysis and established a generalisation of the standard gl theory ( which is correct to @xmath10 ) by retaining additional terms in the expansion up to order @xmath0 . in practice",
    "they have analysed the @xmath11 corrections to the order parameter for 1 , 2 and 3 bands .",
    "they call this formalism extended gl theory",
    ". this extended version with @xmath12 corrections seems to have improved the validity of the gl expansion to some lower temperatures away from @xmath5 in one- and two - band systems .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the microscopic approach of gorkov generally for uniform multiband systems with isotropic ( spherical ) fermi surfaces . other types of fermi surfaces for dirty superconductors and with anisotropy can be done appropriately with more complications .",
    "we present here our detailed calculations of bcs gaps and gl order parameters for superconductors with one and two bands .    in sec.2",
    "we extend the gorkov technique to multiband superconductors in the absence of an external magnetic field , going beyond the standard / traditional model of gl .",
    "the coefficients for all terms in the series expansion of the self - consistent gap equation are given explicitly , and we show how to solve the resulting equations for the gap functions .    in sec.3 results for the one band superconductor are presented showing clearly the departure of the standard gl order parameter ( with @xmath10 ) while comparing with the bcs result .",
    "higher order corrections are reported with impressive agreement with the bcs .",
    "we see that each additional term increases the range of @xmath13 for which the expansion is accurate .    in sec.4 similar results for the two band superconductors",
    "are presented .",
    "these calculations are done for different interband couplings .",
    "in contrast with the single band results , additional terms in the two - band gl expansion only improve the agreement with the bcs result up to a certain value for @xmath13 . pushing beyond this point ,",
    "the agreement becomes worse as additional terms are added .",
    "this disagreement is associated with the appearance of a second critical temperature in the weak coupling limit .    in sec.5",
    "we present the conclusions and summary of this work .",
    "the bcs theory is generalised to a multiband theory @xcite by allowing multiple fermion operators , which are identified by a band index , @xmath14 , and including a josephson interband term in the interaction .",

    "the thin red line that overshoots this is the conventional @xmath10 gl theory , while a selection of plots with higher order corrections up to @xmath0 with @xmath117 are also shown .",
    "the first correction , @xmath12 is seen as the dashed line just above the bcs solution @xcite , while higher order corrections are almost indistinguishable except near @xmath113 . including a larger number of corrections increases the range of convergence , and it is presumed that the infinite sum will converge for all @xmath114 .",
    "however for any large finite sum , the deviation near @xmath113 is expected to remain large .",
    "on the bottom plot of figure [ fig : extendedglonebandbigplot ] we plot the magnitude of each term in the sum .",
    "the error of any finite sum is approximately given by the magnitude of the next term in the sum , and so this plot can be viewed as an estimation of the error in any given finite sum .",
    "the magnitude of each term decreases in general except near @xmath113 , where , after the first few terms , it remains approximately constant .",
    "for the single band case , an exact form for each term in the expansion can be computed , though the number of terms needed increases rapidly .",
    "we report the result for the first three terms in the expansion . @xmath118",
    "in two band gl , things progress in much the same way . however , there is now more a larger range of possibilities due to three parameters in the interband coupling matrix , @xmath24 , especially the role of the interband interaction , @xmath119 .    we know from bcs theory that in the limit that the interband coupling goes to zero , the two gaps are independent and each has their own critical temperatures , which we label @xmath77 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "when the interband coupling is small but nonzero , there is still a large change in the behaviour of the smaller gap near the temperature @xmath120 .",
    "however the critical temperature of the combined system is an enhancement of the dominant band s critical temperature .",
    "the exact lowest order solution can easily be calculated , with the result @xmath121 the higher order terms become increasingly complicated , however the results for specific parameters are calculated numerically to high order .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bcsglplot ] we show plots of the bcs solution for a range of values for the interband coupling , @xmath119 . in a ) the first band is plotted , and it is seen that the interband coupling only has a weak effect on the behaviour of this band , while in b ) , the second gap shows a drastic change as @xmath119 increases , especially near @xmath120 , the critical temperature of the second band in the noninteracting limit . with the increase of the coupling strength ,",
    "the large up - swell of the second band near this critical temperature gets washed out , so that at large coupling the plot looks reminiscent of a one band bcs plot .",
    "plots c ) and d ) depict the order parameters of band 1 and 2 respectively as calculated using the extended gl formalism derived earlier . for @xmath122",
    "the behaviour shown in the gl plots is similar to that of the bcs plots above .",
    "however , for @xmath123 the behaviour of the gl plots is drastically different from the bcs plots , with the difference appearing sooner for smaller @xmath119 .",
    "the point where the solutions begin to disagree is very close to the location of @xmath120 , which in the small coupling limit is @xmath124 . while this finite summation approach does not prove that the series is divergent , it is clear that the sum has not converged in this range for the large number of terms computed .",
    "we expect that in general the sum will converge for all @xmath125 , but converge very slowly or diverge for @xmath126 .",
    "komendova et al .",
    "@xcite argue that there is a possibility of hidden criticality near @xmath120 which becomes critical in the limit that the coupling goes to zero .",
    "this feature is likely to be associated with the anomalous behavior of the gl gaps near this point , and is expected to prevent the series from converging below this point .",
    "surprisingly , while the bcs solution for the first band showed only a weak perturbation with the interband coupling , the non - convergent behaviour seen in the gl solution of the smaller band also affects the dominant band .",
    "this occurs for any small non - zero interband coupling , even though the solution converges for all @xmath13 if the interband coupling is zero . in figure",
    "[ fig : extendedglseries3bigplot ] the first two columns show the extended gl of band 1 and band 2 respectively as a function of @xmath127 for various @xmath119 .",
    "we can see that as the number of terms included in the expansion is increased , the gl solution departs from the bcs solution , shown as dots , in the region @xmath126 , and increasing the number of terms increases this difference .",
    "therefore , with this number of terms , the solution is not converging to the true solution in this range .",
    "the second two columns show the magnitude of each of the terms in the sum on a log plot . in these plots",
    "it is shown that there is approximately a pivot point above which the magnitude of the terms decrease , while below this point the magnitude of the terms increase . at the pivot",
    "point the magnitude of the terms remains approximately constant .",
    "the location of the pivot point is close to the point @xmath128 , especially for small interband coupling .",
    "the location of the point @xmath128 is shown as a vertical black line in the figure .",
    "as @xmath119 increases the location of the pivot point seems to move towards @xmath129 .",
    "however we know that @xmath120 is a constant .",
    "a possible reason for this behaviour of the pivot point is that as @xmath119 increases , @xmath120 does indeed remain constant , but @xmath5 increases , so that @xmath128 should move towards @xmath130 as @xmath119 increases .",
    "it is this increase in @xmath5 that makes the non - convergent point move towards zero as @xmath119 increases .    in figure",
    "[ fig : extendedglseries5bigplot ] we have produced a similar plot to figure [ fig : extendedglseries3bigplot ] but where the gaps in the noninteracting limit have similar critical temperatures . with these parameters , the bcs solution shows that the dominant band is almost unperturbed by the interband interaction . at small interband interaction , the second band",
    "is weakly perturbed except near @xmath5 , however with increasing interband interaction , the second band quickly becomes indistinguishable from the first band .",
    "this is expected since the interband interaction causes the two bands to behave as a single band .",
    "since the properties of the two gaps are already similar in the uncoupled limit , only a reasonably small interband interaction is required before the two bands behave like a single band .",
    "when we look at the gl solution , we see that with these parameters and small interband coupling the region of validity of the solution is very tiny . even after the inclusion of a very large number of terms ,",
    "the region where the gl solution has converged to the bcs solution is only in the range @xmath131 .",
    "when the interband coupling is increased , this range of convergence increases significantly . at large coupling",
    ", the solution converges over almost the complete temperature range . in this case",
    "the two gaps are almost identical .",
    "we see that in the two band case where the two gaps are close to degenerate and the interband coupling is very weak , the gl approximation is only valid in a very small temperature region near @xmath5 , and the theory should be applied with care .",
    "however , for the case where one band is very dominant , or where the interband coupling is very large , the gl theory performs very well , and converges quickly to the bcs result over a fairly large temperature range .",
    "in this paper we have reconstructed the relationship of the bcs theory with the gl theory with the limitations developed by gorkov in his ground - breaking work .",
    "the theory has been restricted to the case of a uniform system , but has been extended to allow multiple bands and large order in @xmath13 .",
    "this extends on the work of ref where the authors calculated a similar expansion keeping terms of order @xmath12 in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we have shown that in a one band superconductor the @xmath12 correction improves the magnitude of order parameter closer to the bcs value .",
    "higher order corrections for @xmath132 in @xmath0 improve the agreement with the bcs result except at @xmath129 , where the series for the gap appears to be nonconvergent .    in the two band situation ,",
    "the interband coupling plays a pivotal role in enhancing the smaller order parameter above the @xmath120 value in the bcs model . as the interband coupling increases the point of inflection around @xmath133 heals gradually . at large interband coupling",
    "both gaps look similar to a one band solution .",
    "the critical temperature of the system evolves smoothly out of the largest critical temperature , @xmath77 , and is enhanced by the interband coupling .    in the gl model",
    "there are significant differences for both the gaps below @xmath126 .",
    "the large deviation persists for weaker interband couplings despite including larger @xmath0 corrections .",
    "this issue is significant when @xmath120 is close to the critical temperature @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the range of validity of the gl solution can be extremely small .",
    "the gl solution to the gaps below @xmath120 is unreliable , and therefore care must be taken when applying the gl model to multiband superconductors .",
    "when the interband coupling is larger or when one of the gaps is very dominant , the gl solution performs much better and including higher order terms can make the solution close to the bcs value over a large temperature range .",
    "similar to the one band case , the point @xmath129 is nonconvergent in the multiband solution regardless of interband coupling .    in summary",
    "we have clearly demonstrated the importance of @xmath0 expansion for large @xmath134 for multiband gl superconductors .",
    "this point emphasises the weaker validity of the gl theory for lower temperatures , and especially for applications with small interband coupling .",
    "we are of the opinion that any use or misuse of gl theory has to be carefully examined considering its domain of applicability .",
