    "in recent years , there has been intense research work in the topic of highly inhomogeneous light beams , and in particular , in light carrying orbital angular momentum ( oam)also called twisted light ( tl ) @xcite .",
    "the research in tl spans several areas , such as the generation of beams @xcite , the interaction of tl with atoms and molecules @xcite or with condensed matter @xcite .",
    "tl has already proved to be useful in applications .",
    "the most notable example is perhaps the optical trapping and manipulation of microscopic particles @xcite .",
    "applications in other fields are also sought , for example in quantum information technology , where the oam adds a new degree of freedom encoding more information @xcite .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies in solid state physics predict , for instance , that tl can induce electric currents in quantum rings @xcite , and new electronic transitions ( forbidden for plane waves ) in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "this all suggests that tl can be a new powerful tool to control quantum states in nanotechnological applications .",
    "two features of tl are particularly striking .",
    "first , tl exhibits a vortex or phase singularity at the beam axis .",
    "second , polarization and oam are so intermixed that two beams having the same oam but opposite circular polarization behave in a completely different way .",
    "this is in contrast to what happens to plane waves , where the polarization alone does not determine other important properties .",
    "these two features can also be found in other inhomogeneous beams , namely the so - called azimuthally polarized @xcite fields .",
    "the interaction between tl and matter is particularly interesting due to the inhomogeneous nature of the tl , and it is worth revisiting its mathematical formulation .",
    "the most general form to describe the light - matter interaction is the minimal coupling hamiltonian , where the electromagnetic ( em ) fields enter through their potentials . in many cases of interest",
    ", the hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of em fields using gauge transformations , i.e. , transformations among potentials that preserve the em fields @xcite . usually , the transformations are accompanied by approximations .",
    "one of the best - known among these hamiltonians is the dipole - moment approximation ( dma ) .",
    "it can be derived under the assumption that the em fields vary little in the region where the matter excitation takes place , and effectively the electric field @xmath0 is treated as spatially homogeneous .",
    "the dma hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dipole moment of the material system .",
    "while gauge invariance is a symmetry property of the electromagnetic interaction and therefore all observable quantities have to be independent of the special choice of a gauge , this independence is usually lost when approximations are performed @xcite .",
    "a standard example is the @xmath3-@xmath4 two - photon transition in a hydrogen atom where it has been explicitly shown that in the case of the @xmath5 coupling already very few intermediate states are sufficient to obtain a very accurate results while in the case of the @xmath6 coupling a very large number of intermediate states is required @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior has been found in calculations of the level width of microwave transitions for the measurement of the lamb shift @xcite . also for single photon transitions in a h@xmath7 ion large differences between the two gauges",
    "have been found when variational wave functions for the molecular orbitals are used with , e.g. for the @xmath8-@xmath9 transition , a strong preference of the @xmath10 coupling @xcite .",
    "the dma form of light - matter coupling is advantageous for several additional reasons : because the dma only contains the electric field , it is manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "the momentum operator has a clear physical meaning and can be used directly for the calculation of quantities like current densities .",
    "in contrast , in the case of the minimal coupling there is an additional , gauge - dependent contribution , usually called the diamagnetic current @xcite .",
    "the difference between the canonical and the mechanical ( or kinetic ) momentum may also lead to an apparent ambiguity in the definition of the photon momentum , as has been discussed in detail in a recent review by barnett et al .",
    "finally , since the dma interaction hamiltonian is linear in the field it can be easily treated perturbatively while the minimal coupling hamiltonian contains terms linear and quadratic in the potential which therefore have to be combined in a proper way when calculating optical nonlinearities .",
    "all these arguments show that a coupling in terms of the electric field has clear advantages .",
    "in fact , when the light field is sufficiently homogeneous over the size of the matter system the dma is perfectly applicable .",
    "this holds for example in atomic and molecular physics and also in the case of nanoscale systems such as quantum dots , where the matter states are highly localized .",
    "when the inhomogeneous nature of the field becomes important the dma can not be used anymore .",
    "one could perform calculations with the minimal coupling hamiltonian , which contains the vector potential . still , it is appealing to work with a hamiltonian which contains the electric and magnetic fields only ,",
    "because then the theory is manifestly gauge invariant . of course , using the so - called poincar gauge @xcite one can formally rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of fields , however , it is not always possible to express the fields explicitly",
    ". a desirable expression would be one resembling the electric dipole - moment hamiltonian , but retaining the spatial dependence : @xmath11 .",
    "we will call this _ electric field coupling _ ( efc ) hamiltonian .",
    "in addition to the dipole - moment coupling , the efc hamiltonian also contains higher order couplings in the electric field , e.g. , quadrupole moments .    in some situations",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity of the field can be kept in an efc hamiltonian in a parametric way , while the transition matrix elements are determined by the coupling via the electric dipole term only @xcite , which has been used to describe for instance four - wave - mixing phenomena @xcite . because for tl new transitions are induced by its oam @xcite",
    ", such an approach would not describe the main feature of tl and , thus , it is crucial to include the spatial dependence also in the transition matrix elements . under certain assumptions , e.g. ,",
    "for the interaction with localized structures placed at the beam maximum , it is possible to cast the hamiltonian in a efc form , and thus , describe the modified selection rules @xcite for example using a power - zienau - woolley transformation @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we show that for tl - matter interaction in the vicinity of the beam axis an efc hamiltonian can not in general be used .",
    "the tl - matter interaction at the phase singularity for highly focused beams has been analyzed using a multipolar expansion for electric and magnetic fields @xcite , which already revealed that higher order electric and magnetic terms can be of significant importance .",
    "nevertheless , for a subgroup of tl beams we will show that it is possible to derive an electric multipolar hamiltonian for the tl - matter interaction close to the phase singularity , which offers the advantages of a dma hamiltonian .",
    "we organize the article as follows . as a next step we briefly revisit the concepts of gauge transformation and dma hamiltonian necessary to understand the discussion ahead . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tl ] we introduce the mathematical representations of tl . in sec .",
    "[ heur ] , using a heuristic derivation much alike the one found in the literature for the dma , we arrive at the new expression for the tl - matter hamiltonian .",
    "section [ sec : bfields ] shows that the atypical behavior of the electric and magnetic fields of tl is in part responsible for the need to modify the hamiltonian .",
    "section [ lag ] is devoted to a careful derivation of the new hamiltonian .",
    "we wrap up with the conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conc ] . in the appendix",
    "we discuss why the efc gauge , which seems to be the natural extension of the dma , is not useful for tl .",
    "the starting point for a mathematical description of the effect of light on matter is the minimal coupling hamiltonian , that expresses the external em fields in terms of a scalar @xmath12 and a vector @xmath13 potential . for a single particle of mass @xmath14 and charge @xmath15 under a static potential @xmath16",

    "u(\\mathbf r , t ) \\,.\\ ] ] it is obtained from the lagrangian @xmath18 via the canonical momentum @xmath19 and the legendre transformation @xmath20 .",
    "the relationship between potentials and the electric @xmath21 and magnetic @xmath22 fields are    @xmath23    gauge transformations are defined such that they preserve the electric and magnetic fields    [ eq : gauge - transf ] @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the scalar gauge transformation function . since the canonical momentum ( [ eq : canonical ] ) depends on the vector potential it is obviously gauge dependent .    in cases where the em fields vary little on the scale of the system , taken to be centered around @xmath26 , a gauge transformation",
    "is sought that would render @xmath27 in the region around @xmath26 . assuming that for external radiation @xmath28 , this is achieved by the gppert - mayer gauge transformation @xmath29 @xcite leading to the new potentials    [ eq : gm - gauge ] @xmath30    by neglecting the derivatives of the old vector potential in the relevant region of space we can obtain @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to the well - known dma hamiltonian @xmath32 which is evidently gauge - invariant .",
    "it should be understood that the requirement @xmath33 in an extended region of space is a very stringent one , for it demands the magnetic field to be zero in that region , in violation to maxwell s equations for a propagating field .",
    "a striking feature of the dma is that operators retain their physical meaning . as an important example",
    ", we look at the momentum . due to the fact that @xmath27 , the canonical momentum in the new gauge is equal to the mechanical momentum @xmath34 .",
    "the mechanical momentum is indeed important , since it is a form - invariant operator @xcite . as such ,",
    "its eigenvalues are independent of the gauge and are therefore representing physical quantities .",
    "the canonical momentum , on the other hand , is not form - invariant .",
    "this is a drawback , because the quantized version of the canonical momentum , i.e. , the operator @xmath35 , is typically used to perform calculations ( see sect .",
    "iv.a.2b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order",
    "to obtain measurable quantities such as current densities , the correction due to the vector potential have to be taken into account , e.g. , in terms of a diamagnetic current @xcite .",
    "the physical ( i.e. , gauge - independent ) current is then given by the sum of two gauge - dependent contributions .",
    "it is obvious that the dma can not be used to describe the interaction of tl with objects placed close to the beam center because there the electric field and thus the whole light - matter coupling vanishes . in analogy with the dma , a transformation function @xmath36",
    "could be used @xcite which keeps the spatial dependence of the vector potential , yielding new potentials    [ eq : local - dipole ] @xmath37    as expected , the new scalar potential has the dipole - like form as that resulting from the gppert - mayer transformation , but now with a position - dependent electric field .",
    "like in the case of the dma the new vector potential does not vanish , but it contains spatial derivatives of the old one .",
    "again , for sufficiently localized charges and a sufficiently smooth vector potential it may be permissible to disregard these terms resulting in new potentials @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with the concomitant benefits of equality of momenta .",
    "we call this the electric field coupling ( efc ) approximation",
    ". however , we will show below that for tl in the region close the the beam axis this gauge is not useful .",
    "let us now come to the case of tl .",
    "a tl beam can have different radial profiles such as laguerre - gaussian or bessel type beams . here",
    "we will consider the case of a bessel beam , which has the advantage of being an exact solution of maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "in mathematical terms , the vector potential of a monochromatic tl beam in cylindrical coordinates @xmath40 , can be described by @xmath41 with components @xcite    [ eq : a_bessel ] @xmath42\\ , ,   \\\\ \\label{eq : a_bessel_phi }      a_\\varphi(\\mathbf r , t ) & = &      \\sigma f_{q_r\\ell}(r ) \\sin[(\\omega t - q_z z ) - ( \\ell + \\sigma)\\varphi]\\ , ,   \\\\ \\label{eq : a_bessel_z }      a_z(\\mathbf r , t ) & = &      -\\sigma \\frac{q_r}{q_z } f_{q_r\\ell+\\sigma}(r )      \\sin[(\\omega t - q_z z ) - ( \\ell + \\sigma)\\varphi ] \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with frequency @xmath43 , wave vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 , related by @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the index of refraction of the medium , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 denoting unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the integer @xmath51 is related to the oam of the beam , as will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the circular polarization of the field , given by polarization vectors @xmath52 , is singled out with the variable @xmath53 , which yields left ( right)-handed circular polarization for the values @xmath54 .",
    "sometimes , in particular in the quantum theory of light , @xmath53 is referred to as the spin angular momentum of the photon with @xmath55 being the spin per photon @xcite .",
    "the radial profile of the beam @xmath56 is a bessel function : @xmath57 , with @xmath58 being the amplitude of the potential .",
    "note that @xmath59 is a measure of the beam waist .",
    "the vector potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_bessel ] ) satisfies the coulomb gauge condition @xmath60 and the vectorial helmholtz equation @xcite .     of the in - plane components of the vector potential ( and",
    "thus of the in - plane components of the electric field ) for a non - vortex beam ( @xmath61 ) and tl beams ( @xmath62 ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : profile ] shows the beam profile @xmath63 of the in - plane components @xmath64 and @xmath65 and thus also of the in - plane components of the electric field for three different values of the oam : @xmath66 . in the region close to @xmath67 , we observe a main difference that exists between non - vortex beams and tl .",
    "while for non - vortex beams ( @xmath61 ) the amplitude has a maximum at @xmath67 , for tl ( @xmath68 ) the amplitude of the in - plane components is zero there .",
    "close to the origin , the profile of the in - plane components can be approximated by @xmath69 .    since for bessel functions the relation @xmath70 holds ,",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_bessel ] ) that the structure of the beam is unchanged if simultaneously the parameters @xmath71 are replaced by @xmath72 .",
    "therefore in the following we will restrict ourselves to tl beams with @xmath73 .    in the paraxial approximation , when @xmath74 , the @xmath75-component of the vector potential is disregarded .",
    "this case has been extensively used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the vector potential in the paraxial approximation @xmath76 then reads @xmath77 in this approximation the positive and negative frequency components of @xmath78 are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator @xmath79 with eigenvalue @xmath80 , which can thus be identified with the oam per photon @xcite .",
    "although this does not strictly hold in the non - paraxial case , for the sake of brevity , in the following whenever we refer to the oam of the beam , we are implicitly referring to the oam of its paraxial version .",
    "the integer @xmath51 is also sometimes called the topological charge @xcite .",
    "in this section , following the spirit of the dma , we derive a gauge transformation that captures the essential features of tl , and at the same time retains the advantages of the dma .",
    "the derivation is intended to be intuitive and self - evident , and is only done for the paraxial vector potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainitial ] ) . a formal analysis leading to the same results will be given in sec .",
    "[ lag ] , where the more general form of the vector potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_bessel ] ) will be used and also the limitations of the paraxial approximation will be discussed .",
    "we are interested in the interaction of tl with a planar , localized structure , such as a quantum disk or a quantum dot , whose lateral dimensions are smaller than the the characteristic radial length scale @xmath81 of the beam ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) .",
    "if such a structure is placed at a position with non - vanishing electric field , in particular close to the beam maximum , the conditions of the dma are satisfied and thus the dma is well applicable .",
    "however , this is different in the case of such a structure centered at @xmath83 . at the beam center",
    "the radial profile of the vector potential can be approximated by @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "note that the vector potential eq.([eq : ainitial ] ) and consequently also the electric field at @xmath83 are zero and thus , within the dma there would be no interaction whatsoever .",
    "motivated by the efc hamiltonian , we try a gauge transformation function of the form @xmath86 where we have defined a two - dimensional in - plane position vector @xmath87 out of the 3d vector @xmath88 , and added a constant prefactor @xmath89 to be determined later .",
    "for @xmath90 the transformation obviously reduces to the efc case . according to eqs .",

    "this is consistent with keeping terms up to order @xmath95 . in the efc gauge ( @xmath90 ) we then have @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "thus , for @xmath98 the new vector potential is not smaller than the old one clearly demonstrating that this gauge does not help to reduce the difference between mechanical and canonical momentum .    on the other hand , when @xmath99 the in - plane components @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the new vector potential vanish for @xmath102 . as a result , @xmath103 .",
    "the hamiltonian then reads @xmath104 we achieve a hamiltonian which contains an efc - like term , but with a different prefactor . furthermore , since the new vector potential vanishes , the canonical and mechanical momenta are equal .",

    "conversely , choosing @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 ) would remove the @xmath113-component but keep the @xmath114-component .",
    "it is legitimate to wonder why there is such an asymmetry between tl fields having the same @xmath51 but differing in their circular polarization state , while an asymmetry of this type is not present in plane waves .",
    "we will further explore this in the next section .",
    "the aforementioned results suggest that there are two topologically distinct classes of tl fields , depending on the combination of oam and circular polarization , which we will study now in detail .",

    "a plot of two representative cases of electric and magnetic fields for @xmath115 and @xmath116 , at @xmath117 and @xmath118 is presented in fig .",

    "the fields of a non - vortex beam with @xmath119 and @xmath120 are also shown .",
    "the vectorial character of the non - vortex beam is similar to a plane wave with perpendicular @xmath121 and @xmath122 fields .",
    "the amplitude is radially modulated according to the bessel function @xmath123 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of tl with @xmath115 the field profiles are much more complex . when @xmath124 , the electric field is oriented azimuthally around the beam axis , and the magnetic field in the central region points inwards . for other values of @xmath125 ( or @xmath75 ) , the patterns change , but eventually both magnetic and electric fields cycle through the radially - like and azimuthally - like polarization patterns .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath99 , the fields look entirely different , and never evolve into azimuthal or radial patterns .",
    "we refer to these two as the anti - parallel [ sign@xmath126 sign@xmath127 and the parallel [ sign@xmath128 sign@xmath127 beam classes .",

    "such a vector field can indeed be written as the gradient of a scalar field .",
    "in contrast , in the anti - parallel class the field lines of the electric field are obviously closed indicating that this is dominantly a vortex - type field which has a non - vanishing curl and therefore can not be obtained as a gradient of a scalar potential .",

    "[ heur ] for the paraxial approximation , also here it is obvious that the efc gauge with @xmath178 is not useful for tl because the transformed in - plane components of the vector potential are not smaller than the original ones .",
    "in fact , for @xmath179 they are in general even larger .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the efc gauge can be found in the appendix . in the following",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the tl gauge @xmath180 and @xmath181 and discuss the vector potential for the different cases .",

    "[ heur ] . in the parallel class",
    "the radial dependence of the transformed potential is the same as for the original one .",
    "moreover , each component of the vector potential contains a term proportional to the small quantities @xmath185 .",

    "then the expressions simplify to    @xmath186      a_{z}(\\mathbf r , t ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first thing to notice is that the components @xmath187 and @xmath188 of the new vector potential are zero , as we have already found in sec .",
    "therefore , in the hamiltonian @xmath189 the in - plane tl - matter interaction can be expressed solely by a dipole - like term @xmath190 with a prefactor different to the efc hamiltonian . for the @xmath75-component we have both a dipole - like term , but also",
    "a term @xmath191 which still contains the vector potential .",
    "we point out that @xmath192 a'_z\\,^2(\\mathbf r , t ) \\propto ( q_r r)^{2\\ell+2}$ ] , and may be safely disregarded .",
    "it is interesting to also compare again the canonical and mechanical momenta .",
    "their difference is given by @xmath193 also here the canonical and mechanical momenta are the same for the in - plane components and only in the @xmath75-component a difference in the momenta arises , which is however of the order @xmath143 and therefore one order higher than the correction to the in - plane momenta in the original gauge .",
    "let us now consider what happens in situations of experimental and application interest .",
    "we first address the situation when the interaction with the system only occurs through the in - plane components of the field , for example in the selective excitation of heavy holes in a quantum dot .",
    "then , the tl - matter interaction reads @xmath194 and is modeled by electric multipoles only with all the benefits of a dma .",
    "effectively we end up in the desirable situation where the vector potential is eliminated , as also shown in sec .",
    "nevertheless the description is beyond the dma because it keeps the full spatial dependence of the electric field and thus can give rise to transitions which are forbidden in the case of excitation by plane waves , for example transitions from envelope function with @xmath195-type symmetry in the valence band to those with @xmath196-type symmetry in the conduction band or vice versa .",
    "next , we consider the case where the system interacts with the @xmath75-component of the field , for example in intersubband transitions in quantum wells @xcite or the excitation of light holes @xcite . here , the electric multipoles are accompanied by a magnetic term arising from the non - vanishing @xmath75-component of the vector potential . however , since no atypical behavior of the fields near the phase singularity occurs , it is expected that the electric interaction is larger than the magnetic one as usually happens .",
    "one could then safely only retain the electric multipolar term , and possibly neglect the difference between momenta .",
    "therefore for the parallel class a hamiltonian with only electric dipole - moment terms having the correct prefactors can describe the tl - matter interaction at the phase singularity .      for the anti - parallel class",
    ", we already found that a description with electric field only is not sufficient .",
    "still , we can gain valuable insights from studying the anti - parallel case with sign(@xmath51 ) @xmath145 sign(@xmath53 ) , i.e. , @xmath124 . here , the vector potential reads :    @xmath197 a_\\varphi(\\mathbf r , t ) \\ , , \\\\ \\label{eq : apbeta4_varphi }      a_\\varphi'(\\mathbf r , t ) & = &      \\frac{2\\ell}{\\ell+1 } a_\\varphi(\\mathbf r , t )      - \\frac{q_r^2}{2q_z^2 } \\frac{q_z z}{\\ell } \\left [ ( \\ell-1 ) - \\frac{4\\ell(\\ell-1)}{(q_r r)^2}\\right ] a_r(\\mathbf r , t ) \\",

    "thus , the transformed vector potential becomes even stronger close to the phase singularity .",
    "the magnetic interaction resulting from these terms may be comparable or even surpass the electric interaction .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results for highly focused beams , where a magnetic field contribution stronger than the electric field contribution at the phase singularity was found @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting , that even far from the phase singularity , the in - plane term @xmath188 does not vanish .",
    "let us study this in more detail using as an example the excitation of a quantum dot placed at the beam axis by a tl beam and energy close to the qd band - gap .",
    "considering again the case of optical transitions with in - plane matrix elements such as the heavy hole - to - conduction band transitions , we neglect the @xmath75-component of the interaction , and also the terms proportional to @xmath201 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath202 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ we note that the angular component of the momentum vector reads @xmath203 , where the canonical momentum @xmath204 is in fact an angular momentum @xcite . ]",
    "though there is an efc - type hamiltonian , clearly the in - plane vector potential remains in the hamiltonian .",
    "we wonder how electric and magnetic contributions compare to each other .",
    "let us specifically consider the case @xmath150 .",
    "then , the electric multipolar term is proportional to @xmath205 . on the other hand , the magnetic term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_anti - parallel ] ) is proportional to @xmath206 .",
    "if we assume that momentum and position vector are proportional to each other , as it is so in the dma ( since @xmath207 $ ] ) , it becomes clear that one should not a priori neglect the magnetic interaction , for it may be comparable or even larger the electric interaction , in particular at the phase singularity .",
    "when the @xmath75-component of the fields become also important , it is clear that also here the vector potential remains in the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , for the anti - parallel class the tl - gauge transformation , though being mathematically correct , is in general not advantageous .",
    "we have studied the tl - matter interaction close to the beam axis .",
    "in contrast to conventional light beams , twisted light has a phase singularity at the point @xmath83 , and a strong intermixing between polarization and oam .",
    "we distinguished the tl beams into two topologically different classes , namely the parallel class where handedness of circular polarization ( i.e. , the photon spin ) and oam have the same sign and the anti - parallel class where the signs of circular polarization and oam differ .    to obtain a hamiltonian which includes the em fields instead of the potentials , we suggested to use a new gauge , the tl gauge .",
    "for the parallel class , the tl gauge leads to a hamiltonian which has a dipole - type structure , but a different prefactor . for in - plane problems it takes the simple form @xmath208 .",
    "the prefactor is mandatory to describe the correct interaction and to achieve the identity of canonical and mechanical momentum .",
    "the origin of the prefactor in the tl gauge is the vortex , which exists at the phase singularity . for the anti - parallel class we showed that the tl gauge , which casts the hamiltonian at least partly into electric fields , is not in general advantageous as the vector potential can not be eliminated nor neglected .",
    "because in the anti - parallel class magnetic effects can not be neglected compared to the electric ones , the hamiltonian should include magnetic as well as electric terms , and their relative strength must be analyzed in the particular problem at hand .",
    "we compared the tl gauge to the more common dma and efc hamiltonians . while for structures located close to the beam maximum",
    "the dma is applicable , for structures located close to the beam center it can not be used since the electric field at the phase singularity vanishes .",
    "we have also pointed out that the use of the paraxial approximation close to the phase singularity may be misleading and should be avoided at least in the anti - parallel beam class .",
    "in contrast to other gauges the tl gauge depends explicitly on beam parameters , in particular on the oam @xmath51 . on the one hand",
    "this is clearly a restriction , but on the other hand , when tl is used to excite structures in the region of the beam center , this is usually done with the aim to address specific transitions which are driven by a light field with a given value of @xmath51 . in this case",
    "a beam with a well - defined @xmath51 is used and thus , at least for beams within the parallel class , the tl gauge for this experimental set - up is well defined and can be used to write the coupling completely in terms of the electric field .    in comparison to other gauges , like the poincar - gauge or the multipolar gauge",
    ", the tl gauge offers the same advantages for tl beams in the parallel class as the dma offers for slowly varying light beams : in contrast to the poincar - gauge , the tl gauge can be simply evaluated and leads to explicit formulas . for in - plane problems @xmath209 contains only the electric field , which makes it manifestly gauge invariant and secures the physical meaning of the momentum operator .",
    "furthermore , it contains all the higher order electric field couplings like coupling to quadrupole terms in a compact , appealing form .",
    "g.  f.  quinteiro would like to thank p.  i.  tamborenea for fruitful discussions in the topic of gauge - invariance in general and applied to tl .",
    "he also thanks the argentine research agency conicet for financial support through the `` programa de becas externas '' .",
    "in this appendix we will discuss in some more detail why the efc gauge is not useful for tl .",
    "we obtain the efc gauge from our more general gauge function eq .",
    "( [ eq : chigeneral ] ) by setting @xmath210 . from the general formulas ( [ eq : new_a ] ) we can then calculate the new potentials . in the parallel class , when restricting ourselves to the lowest non - vanishing order in @xmath138 ( which is the order @xmath51 for the in - plane components and @xmath177 for the @xmath75-component ) and , as discussed in sec .",

    "such a contradiction is only apparent for the following reason .",
    "we approximated the in - plane components of the vector potential to lowest order in @xmath213 , i.e. , @xmath214 . under this approximation @xmath215 and thus there is no contradiction .",
