    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of macromolecules such as proteins and polymers have become increasingly common as forcefields have improved and computers have become more powerful . of particular interest is the integration of md simulations with nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy ( noesy ) , and variants thereof , which directly probe the nuclear dipole - dipole interactions , and which have proven to yield unique information about the structure and dynamics of macromolecules @xcite .",
    "an important approach in the interpretation of non - rigid macromolecules has been the separation of the fast internal dynamics which are accessible by md simulations , from the much slower dynamics related to rotation of the entire macromolecule .",
    "a popular technique for this separation has been the model - free lipari - szabo approach @xcite , which yields important information about the structure and dynamics of the non - rigid branches and internal motions of the macromolecules .",
    "the integration of md simulations and nmr measurements presented here also requires state of the art in both computation and measurement . on the measurement side ,",
    "such studies require careful de - oxygenation of the fluid for accurate measurements of the intrinsic nmr relaxation times @xcite , as well as diffusion experiments free of convection and hardware artifacts @xcite . on the computational side , with current empirical potential ( forcefield ) models",
    "it is now possible to readily access @xmath10  ns time scales that are of interest in understanding relaxation processes in confined fluids .",
    "but care is needed in ensuring the potential models are reasonable and the simulations are well - crafted .",
    "one emerging area of interest for integrating md simulations with nmr measurement is in porous organic media such as kerogen , where the phase - behavior and transport properties of hydrocarbons and water are greatly affected by confinement in the organic nanometer - sized pores .",
    "studies of fluid confinement in organic nano - pores is of great interest in characterizing organic - shale reservoirs such as gas - shale and tight - oil shale @xcite .",
    "for example , md simulations are well suited for investigating the effects of wettability alterations in organic matter @xcite , or the effects of restricted diffusion and pore connectivity of organic nano - pores .",
    "recent md simulations of fluids confined in graphitic nano - pores have shown promising results for molecular interactions between surfaces and fluids such as hydrocarbons and water @xcite .",
    "recent nmr measurements of hydrocarbons and water confined in the organic nano - pores of isolated kerogen indicate that @xmath0h@xmath0h dipole - dipole interactions play a key role in surface relaxivity , pore - size analysis , and fluid typing @xcite",
    ". however , to the best of the authors knowledge , no comprehensive studies have been performed which integrate md simulations with nmr measurements of hydrocarbons and water , either in the bulk phase or under confinement in porous media , even though the techniques exist to generate molecular models of kerogen for md simulations @xcite .",
    "another emerging area of interest is in using md simulations to characterize the nmr relaxation in complex multi - component fluids such as heavy crude - oils @xcite , or model systems for crude - oils such as polymer - solvent mixes @xcite . in such cases",
    "the lipari - szabo model is a good approach for separating the slow dynamics related to viscosity from the fast dynamics related to local non - rigid molecular motions .",
    "the objective in such cases is to obtain a more fundamental understanding of the nmr relaxation and diffusion of crude - oils , thereby helping to characterize petroleum fluids .",
    "the first step in embarking in such studies is to successfully integrate md simulations and nmr measurements of relaxation and diffusion for bulk hydrocarbons and bulk water .",
    "this report presents such a task , and validates the forcefields used in md simulations for bulk hydrocarbons and water , without any adjustable parameters in the interpretation of the simulation data .",
    "the md simulations are then used to distinguish intramolecular from intermolecular nmr relaxation .",
    "our studies provide new insight into the two relaxation mechanisms , which is not straightforward to do from nmr measurements alone @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive investigation into the two relaxation mechanisms is required to improve the characterization of macromolecules such as proteins and polymers , where typically only the intramolecular interaction is considered @xcite , without any substantial justification .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows .",
    "the methodology behind the md simulations of nmr relaxation and diffusion are presented in section [ sc : method ] .",
    "this is followed by results and discussions in section [ sc : results ] , including correlation between simulations and measurements , intramolecular versus intermolecular interactions , and , analysis using traditional hard - sphere models .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sc : conc ] .",
    "this section presents details of the molecular simulation procedure , the nmr relaxation analysis , and the diffusion analysis .",
    "the molecular simulations were performed using namd @xcite version 2.11 .",
    "the bulk alkanes were modeled using the charmm general force field ( cgenff ) @xcite and bulk water was modeled using the tip4p/2005 model @xcite . in the case of water , the relaxation behavior ( see below ) using the more refined amoeba polarizable model @xcite was in excellent agreement with predictions based on tip4p/2005 ( data not shown ) . given the typically greater challenge in modeling water , we thus expect the relaxation behavior in alkanes modeled with a polarizable model and the modern cgenff non - polarizable model to be comparable .",
    "thus for computational economy , in this study we used non - polarizable models throughout .",
    "( the good agreement between simulations and experiments supports this suggestion . )",
    "the simulation cells for the hydrocarbons were constructed as follows .",
    "we first construct a single molecule using the avogadro program @xcite .",
    "we than create @xmath11 copies of this molecule and pack it into a cube of volume @xmath12 using the packmol program @xcite .",
    "the volume is chosen such that the number density @xmath13 corresponds to the experimentally determined number density at 293.15  k ( 20@xmath14c ) .",
    "all the subsequent simulations are performed at this number density and temperature due to the availability of density @xcite and viscosity @xcite data at that temperature .",
    "this initial system was energy minimized to relieve any energetic strain due to limitations in the packing procedure .",
    "for the water simulation , we used an existing equilibrated simulation cell for the present study .",
    "the alkane simulations typically comprised between 1660 ( @xmath1-c@xmath2h@xmath3 ) and 2125 ( @xmath1-c@xmath4h@xmath5 ) carbon atoms , while the water system comprised 512 water molecules .    for the molecular dynamics simulations , the equations of motion",
    "were propagated using the verlet algorithm with a time step of 1.0  fs .",
    "( the shake @xcite procedure was used to constrain the geometry of water molecules , but the c  h bond in the alkane was not similarly constrained . )",
    "we first equilibrate the simulation cell for 2  ns at a temperature of 293.15  k. the temperature was controlled by reassigning velocities ( obtained from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) every 250  fs .",
    "the lennard - jones interactions were terminated at 14.00   ( 11   for water ) by smoothly switching to zero starting at 13.00   ( 10   for water ) .",
    "electrostatic interactions were treated with the particle mesh ewald method with a grid spacing of 0.5  ; the real - space contributions to the electrostatic interaction were cutoff at 14.00   . for water",
    "the equilibration was for 0.25  ns .",
    "we started the production run of 2  ns time from the end - point of the equilibration run .",
    "since the dynamics of relaxation are of first interest here , the production phase was performed at constant density and energy ( nve ensemble ) , i.e.  the system was not thermostated .",
    "the average temperature of the system is within 2  k of the target ( 293.15  k ) for all the alkanes except @xmath1-c@xmath15h@xmath3 ( pentane ) for which the deviation was about 3  k. as a further check of the simulation , we also monitored the average energy of the system .",
    "all the simulations showed excellent energy conservation , with the standard error of the mean energy relative to the mean energy being less than @xmath16 . in the production phase",
    ", configurations were saved every 0.1  ps for the hydrocarbons and 0.125  ps for water .",
    "the theory of nmr relaxation in liquids is very well established @xcite , and for brevity we consider only the essential details .",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath17 of fluctuating magnetic dipole - dipole interactions is central to the development of nmr relaxation theory in liquids .",
