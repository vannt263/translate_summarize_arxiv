    "spin - charge separation and interaction dependent power laws of correlation functions have been known as non - fermi - liquid behavior of tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid , which is expected to describe the low energy physics of one dimensional ( 1d ) interacting electron systems @xcite . in the past ten years , experimental evidences for the realization of tl states have been reported in many systems such as carbon nanotube devices @xcite , quantum wires in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite and fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite , as predicted by theories  .",

    "instead , experiments on resonant tunneling @xcite seems to be a more suitable procedure to detect the spin - charge separation , since they probes the energy level spacings in the quantum island .    the resonant tunneling in tl liquid has been studied for more than a decade since kane and fisher s work @xcite .",

    "and the preparation of the local magnetic field @xmath1 with a submicron meter scale is also an open issue , though there are some works reporting magnetic fields with a micron meter scale  @xcite .",
    "however , if one uses a quantum wire with a small fermi energy and a large @xmath235-factor _ e.g. _ an insb quantum wire with @xmath240 , two problems lying on carbon nanotubes are cleared , and our predictions can possibly be verified in experiments .",
    "ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , which shows remarkable progress in experiments , with controllable parameters such as interaction parameters , lattice shapes , and the potential height , will also give us another conceivable stage to test our theory .",
    "it is the more important issue of spintronics to suggest new ways of creating spin filters _",
    "i.e. _ the way to modify the split of scaling dimensions between two spin channels in more realistic models",
    ". however the concepts of `` spin - charge mixing effect '' will play one key role in this matter .",

    "we check whether their statements can also be applied to a polarized tl liquid , and whether our result in eq.([eq : conductance in clean limit 2 ] ) , which implies that applying bias voltage generates spin current by spin - charge mixing effect , is an artifact of the assumption to be an infinite system .",
