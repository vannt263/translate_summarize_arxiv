    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) has become a standard tool in bayesian analysis .",
    "the greatest benefit of mcmc is its generality  it is guaranteed to be consistent with virtually no assumptions on the underlying model . however , the practical applicability of mcmc generally depends on the dimension of the unknown variables , the number of data , and the computational resources available .",
    "furthermore , because mcmc is sequential in nature , it can be difficult to implement efficiently with modern parallel and distributed computing architectures ; see @xcite for general discussion about mcmc in challenging scenarios , and with parallel computing architectures .",
    "in recent years , a number of generic approximation methods have been developed for complex bayesian inference , for instance variational bayes ( cf .",
    "reviews * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , expectation propagation @xcite and laplace approximations @xcite .",
    "these methods have been reported to provide accurate enough inference for practical purposes in many scenarios , with a fraction of computing time compared with ( asymptotically ) exact approaches such as mcmc .",
    "one problem with approximate methods is that the related bias is typically hard or impossible to quantify , and in practice the only way to ensure the validity of the method is to compare the outcome with an exact method , such as mcmc .",
    "we promote , in broad terms , a well - known principle : the combination of an approximate method for ` preliminary ' inference , and importance sampling type correction of the output .",
    "our primary focus is on the approximation of a marginal distribution ( or marginal likelihood ) and the use of mcmc for approximate marginal inference .",
    "the outcome of the mcmc is corrected with importance sampling type estimates .",
    "we detail minimal requirements which lead to strongly consistent estimators and give general conditions under which central limit theorems hold .",
    "our setting highlights explicitly the connection of importance sampling type correction and recently developed pseudo - marginal type mcmc @xcite , such as particle mcmc @xcite , grouped independence metropolis - hastings ( gimh ) @xcite , approximate bayesian computation mcmc @xcite , the algorithm for estimation of discretely observed diffusions suggested in @xcite , and using annealed importance sampling @xcite .",
    "it also enables the use of debiased estimators as suggested in @xcite .",
    "all these methods are often computationally expensive , but our approach is based on independent realisations of such importance sampling type estimates , which can be calculated efficiently in parallel .",
    "we focus on bayesian state space models , where importance sampling and particle filters are used for correction .",
    "we believe that the setup is useful much more generally , for instance in latent variable models or discretisations of continuous models , such as diffusions or inverse problems .",
    "importance sampling correction of mcmc has been suggested early in the mcmc literature ; see at least @xcite .",
    "it has been used , for instance , when estimating bayes factors using a single mcmc output @xcite .",
    "bhattacharya @xcite has suggested a consistent estimator based on regeneration and tan , doss and hobert @xcite give such estimators in case of using multiple markov chains .    using unbiased estimators of importance weights in this context",
    "has been suggested at least in @xcite , who consider a generalisation of the pseudo - marginal method , allowing for likelihood estimators that occasionally take negative values .",
    "this allows , for instance , using the recently discovered ` debiasing tricks ' @xcite in order to construct an unbiased estimator .",
    "similar tricks , which would lead into non - negative unbiased estimators , as required by the pseudo - marginal method , may be unavailable ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "quiroz , villani and kohn @xcite applied the is correction in the data sub - sampling context .    nested sampling has also appeared in many forms in the monte carlo literature .",
    "the smc^2^ algorithm @xcite is based on an application of nested sequential monte carlo steps , which has similarities with our framework , and the is^2^ method @xcite focuses on the case where the preliminary inference is based on importance sampling .",
    "we focus on the mcmc approximation of the marginal distribution , which we believe often to be easily implementable in practice .",
    "the markov chain nature of the marginal monte carlo approximation comes also with some extra theoretical issues which we address .",
    "another specific feature of our work is that we connect is type correction explicitly with recently discovered ` exact approximation mcmc ' techniques @xcite .",
    "theoretical advances @xcite have already led to more efficient implementation of such methods , but has also revealed fundamental limitations .",
    "for instance , the methods may suffer from slow ( non - geometric ) convergence in practically interesting scenarios @xcite .",
    "recently proposed correlated version of the pseudo - marginal mcmc @xcite may help in more efficient implementation of pseudo - marginal type methods , but the question of their efficient parallelisability remains a challenge .",
    "the blocked parallelisable particle gibbs @xcite has appealing limiting properties , but its implementation still requires synchronisation between every update cycle , which may be costly in some computing environments .",
    "we recognise that our is approach comes with its own limitations ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) , but we believe that it can often be very useful with parallel computing facilities .",
    "after preliminaries and notation in section [ sec : notation ] , we discuss a general importance sampling ( is ) type correction of mcmc outputs and we state related consistency results in section [ sec : simple ] .",
    "we detail the general case where unbiased estimators are used ( proposition [ prop : simple - is ] ) and then extend the setting in order to allow inference in an extended state space ( proposition [ prop : proper - consistency ] ) .",
    "the latter result is based on a general concept ( assumption [ a : proper ] ) , which we call ` proper weighting scheme ' following the terminology of liu @xcite .",
    "it accommodates naturally estimators from importance sampling and sequential monte carlo .",
    "we believe that assumption [ a : proper ] , or the more general assumption [ a : super - general ] , could be satisfied relatively easily in a wide variety of scenarios .    in section [ sec : ssm ] ,",
    "we discuss how our importance sampling correction method applies in general state space models ( ssm ) , and observe that sequential importance sampling and particle filters both lead to proper weighting schemes ( corollary [ cor : proper - ssm ] ) .",
    "the unbiasedness property of particle filters observed in @xcite suggests a method of its own interest : a simple , general and parallelisable general particle ssm smoothing algorithm , with naturally available consistent confidence intervals ( proposition [ prop : particle - smooth - confidence ] ) .",
    "we are unaware of earlier works which explicitly state this potentially useful result , but we are mindful that it may be widely known by particle filter experts .",
    "section [ sec : asvar - clt ] discusses conditions under which our estimators admit a central limit theorem .",
    "the expressions for the asymptotic variance may be useful , for instance , when optimising the computational resources .",
    "section [ sec : block ] focuses on a so - called jump chain representation @xcite , where we propose block estimators that use the jump chain structure . in this context , it is possible to employ variance reduction techniques , such as stratification or rao - blackwellisation using the scheme of @xcite . section [ sec : delayed ] starts by making an explicit connection between the proper weighting schemes and the pseudo - marginal type mcmc , and then between the is type correction of mcmc and a two - stage delayed acceptance scheme @xcite .    in section [ sec : exp ] , we detail a more specific class of ssms with linear - gaussian state dynamics and explain a generic laplace approximation method that fits this class of models . we compare different algorithmic variations with a model having poisson observations and with a stochastic volatility model . we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] with a discussion of the possible implications of our findings .",
