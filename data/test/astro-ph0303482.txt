    "the acceleration and collimation of powerful bipolar outflows and jets in a variety of astronomical settings are often attributed to the action of magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the commonly invoked scenario is that magnetic field lines threading a rotating compact object or its surrounding accretion disk can efficiently tap the rotational energy of the source and accelerate gas to supersonic speeds through centrifugal and/or magnetic pressure - gradient forces .",
    "it is argued that the hoop stresses of the twisted field lines can account for the narrowness of many jets and that , in many cases , alternative production mechanisms ( such as thermal driving ) can be excluded on observational grounds .",
    "although numerical simulations have provided useful insights into various aspects of hydromagnetic jet production , practical limitations have necessitated complementing this approach with analytic studies .",
    "owing to the complexity of the problem , the most general semianalytic solutions obtained so far have been time - independent and self - similar , patterned after the pioneering disk - outflow solutions of @xcite .",
    "the advantage of pursuing such solutions is that they are exact and self - consistent , and that they can be systematically classified ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , these solutions are evidently rich enough to capture most of the relevant physics , as corroborated by numerical calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "almost all of the previous semianalytic work on jet magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) was done in the newtonian limit of nonrelativistic bulk and random speeds .",
    "relativistic outflows are , however , observed quite commonly in nature  with examples including active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , galactic superluminal sources ( often referred to as `` microquasars '' ) , pulsars , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs) and in many of these cases magnetic fields are again implicated as the main driving and collimation mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this provides a motivation for generalizing the newtonian self - similar outflow solutions , although it is readily seen that this can not be done in a totally straightforward manner .",
    "for one thing , special - relativistic mhd ( unlike the nonrelativistic theory ) involves a characteristic speed ( the speed of light @xmath1 ) , which precludes the incorporation of gravity into the self - similar equations and a simple matching of the outflow solution to a particular ( e.g. , keplerian ) disk rotation law .",
    "furthermore , again in contrast with the nonrelativistic formulation , the displacement current and the charge density can not be neglected in the constitutive equations ( which now must also satisfy relativistic covariance ) .    despite the aforementioned complications , @xcite and @xcite succeeded in generalizing the `` cold , '' radially self - similar solutions of @xcite to the relativistic regime .",
    "their solutions are characterized by the thermal pressure playing a negligible role in the flow acceleration and by the flow being trans - alfvnic : the poloidal speed is less than the poloidal component of the alfvn speed at the base of the flow , and comes to exceed it further up .",
    "our aim in this paper is to further generalize these solutions to the `` hot '' relativistic case  i.e. , we allow both the bulk _ and _ the random speeds to be relativistic . this is motivated primarily by the desire to apply these solutions to grb outflows , in which thermal driving by an optically thick , hot `` fireball '' composed primarily of radiation and electron - positron pairs could play a role .",
    "in fact , most previous models of grb outflows were purely hydrodynamical and included only thermal driving ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it has subsequently been realized that energy deposition by annihilating neutrinos , which had been one of the main proposed heating mechanisms , would typically be inefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it was , furthermore , argued @xcite that only a small fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the energy deposited in the source could be in thermal form to avoid generating strong photospheric emission in the outflow ( for which there has been no observational evidence ) . for these ( and other ) reasons , it is now believed that magnetic fields play the dominant role in the driving of grb jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , some thermal energy injection , either by neutrinos or by magnetic energy dissipation , is likely to take place ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , as we show in",
    " [ soln_a ] , even if it contributes only a small fraction of the initial energy flux in the flow , it can dominate the early phase of the acceleration . there are indications that thermal energy deposition at the source may also contribute to the initial acceleration of relativistic jets in agns ( e.g. , @xcite ; n. vlahakis & a. knigl , in preparation ) .",
    "it thus appears that , to fully understand the nature of such jets , it is necessary to model them in terms of a `` hot '' mhd outflow .",
    "the ability of large - scale , ordered magnetic fields to guide , collimate , and accelerate relativistic outflows has been previously discussed by various authors ( including , in the grb context , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "these discussions , however , did not include exact solutions from which detailed quantitative estimates could be made . in a previous paper , vlahakis & knigl ( 2001 , hereafter vk01 ) presented a semianalytic self - similar solution of the `` hot '' relativistic mhd equations and applied it to the interpretation of grbs .",
    "the full formalism underlying this solution is described in the present paper , where we also analyze its dependence on the relevant physical parameters and compare it with other characteristic solutions of trans - alfvnic flows .",
    "this discussion is extended in the companion paper ( vlahakis & knigl 2003 , hereafter paper ii ) , where we focus on super - alfvnic flows .",
    "the self - similar solutions that we derive correspond to ordered magnetic field configurations in the ideal - mhd limit .",
    "although it is quite conceivable that the fields that drive the flow from a differentially rotating star or disk are at least in part small - scale and disordered , the statistical ( temporal and spatial ) averages of such fields could in principle have a similar effect to that of large - scale , ordered field configurations in providing both acceleration @xcite and collimation @xcite .",
    "the applicability of ideal mhd to the acceleration of ultrarelativistic flows has been questioned by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , who proposed instead a force - free electromagnetic formulation .",
    "we note in this connection that a force - free behavior can be recovered from the relativistic mhd formulation as a limiting case of negligible particle inertia .",
    "furthermore , electromagnetic energy dissipation  perhaps the strongest argument against the ideal - mhd modeling framework  has been claimed to lead , on its own , to an efficient conversion of poynting flux into a highly relativistic bulk motion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our ideal - mhd solutions may thus be regarded as a first step toward a more comprehensive theory in which dissipation effects will be taken into account ( and possibly further enhance the effectiveness of the magnetic acceleration process ) .    although the formulation presented in this paper",
    "is quite general , the main application that we consider is to grb sources . for definiteness",
    ", we adopt the `` internal shock '' scenario for the origin of the prompt high - energy emission in grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "considerations involving variability time scales ( as interpreted in the context of this picture ) as well as source energetics support the identification of an accretion disk around a newly formed black hole as the source of the grb outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; accordingly , we concentrate on modeling jets from accretion disks",
    ". however , our solutions should be at least qualitatively applicable also to other source configurations , such as a rapidly spinning neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a rotating , magnetically threaded black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since grb outflows have a limited duration ( the value of which is plausibly related to the disk accretion time ) , a naive application of a steady - state similarity solution is not warranted .",
    "in previous , purely hydrodynamical models of grb outflows , this difficulty was circumvented by applying the so - called `` frozen pulse '' approximation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prove (  [ governing ] ) that this approximation can be generalized to the relativistic mhd regime , but we also demonstrate (  [ timerecovery ] ) how any inherent time dependence can be recovered .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  [ mhd ] we present the equations of time - dependent relativistic mhd , simplify them using the frozen - pulse approximation , and discuss what effect each of the various forces acting on the plasma has on the flow acceleration and collimation . in  [ r - ss_section ]",
    "we describe the @xmath3 self - similar model and in  [ results ] we give the results of the numerical integration of the model equations .",
    "we discuss general implications of this work to grb sources and other relativistic jet sources in  [ conclusions ] , where we also summarize our conclusions .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of relativistic mhd consists of three parts  matter ( subscript m ) , radiation ( subscript r ) and electromagnetic fields ( subscript em ) : @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the matter component is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the total comoving matter energy density , @xmath8 is the particle pressure , @xmath9 is the fluid four - velocity , and @xmath10 is the metric tensor ( assuming a flat spacetime and cartesian space coordinates @xmath11 ) . here @xmath12 is the baryon rest - mass density , @xmath13 is the internal energy density , with @xmath14 denoting the polytropic index ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 in the limit of an ultrarelativistic or a nonrelativistic temperature , respectively ) , @xmath17 is the three - velocity measured in the frame of the central object , and @xmath18 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the radiation component is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the radiation energy density and pressure in the fluid rest frame .",
    "radiation forces are typically most important in regions that are sufficiently optically thick that one can take the local radiation field to be nearly isotropic and set @xmath22 .",
    "we are most interested in the ultrarelativistic case @xmath23 , in which the matter and radiation can be treated ( under optically thick conditions ) as a single fluid .",
    "thus , we henceforth write @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .    introducing the specific ( per baryon mass ) relativistic enthalpy @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and including the contribution of the electric ( @xmath29 ) and magnetic ( @xmath30 ) fields ( measured in the central - object frame )",
    ", the components of the total stress - energy tensor take the form ( @xmath31 )    @xmath32    with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 representing the energy density , energy flux , and spatial stress contributions , respectively .",
    "the electromagnetic field obeys maxwell s equations @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the four - current ( with @xmath38 representing the charge density ) . under the assumption of ideal mhd ,",
    "the comoving electric field is zero , which implies @xmath39    the baryon mass conservation equation is @xmath40 , or @xmath41 in the absence of a gravitational field or any other external force , the equations of motion are @xmath42 .",
    "the momentum conservation equation is given by the @xmath43 components , @xmath44 the entropy conservation equation ( the first law of thermodynamics ) is obtained by setting @xmath45 , @xmath46 which can be rewritten ( using @xmath47 $ ] ) as @xmath48    one can carry out a partial integration of equations ( [ maxwell])([energy ] ) under the assumptions of axisymmetry [ in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 and of a zero azimuthal electric field ( @xmath51 ) if the flow is time - independent ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we now show that the equations describing a highly relativistic mhd `` pulse '' that could be identified with a grb event may , in fact , be cast in a steady - state form .",
    "we start by noting that , with the above assumptions @xmath52 , the poloidal component of faraday s law implies that the poloidal magnetic field is time independent .",
    "if the field is anchored in an accretion disk , then the poloidal field near the disk surface would remain quasi steady at least on the timescale of the local radial inflow ( @xmath53 ) . in the case of a grb outflow associated with the emptying up ( by accretion onto a black hole ) of a disk of finite size",
    ", the poloidal field may be expected to change significantly only on the timescale of the burst duration . at the end of this time interval ,",
    "the information that the field has changed starts to propagate with at most the speed of light ( the actual speed of propagation is the fast magnetosonic speed , which is generally @xmath54 in a material medium ) .",
    "as we are concerned with highly relativistic outflows , it is reasonable to expect that the poloidal field associated with the outflowing fluid elements that produce the burst will exhibit negligible explicit time dependence ( @xmath55 ) over the duration of the burst .",
    "( note , however , that the azimuthal component of the magnetic field , which is related to the poynting flux , will be time dependent . )",
    "the solenoidal condition on the magnetic field , @xmath56 , implies that there is a poloidal magnetic flux function @xmath57 , defined by @xmath58 , which satisfies @xmath59 where the subscripts @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the poloidal and azimuthal components , respectively .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ ohm ] ) together with the condition @xmath62 implies @xmath63 , from which it follows that there are functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( whose coordinate dependence we discuss below ) such that @xmath66    denoting the arclength along a poloidal fieldline by @xmath67 , we change variables from ( @xmath68 ) to ( @xmath69 ) , with @xmath70 . for any function @xmath71 , we can define the operator @xmath72 we now rewrite the mhd equations using @xmath73    [ mhd - eqs - s ] equation ( [ solenoidal ] ) becomes @xmath74 whereas equation ( [ ohm ] ) gives @xmath75 faraday s law implies @xmath76 and the continuity equation yields @xmath77 where , using equation ( [ v - b ] ) , @xmath78 .",

    "@xmath89 2 ) the term @xmath96 in equation ( [ continuity - s ] ) is of the order of @xmath97 and is thus negligible in comparison with the first term on the left - hand side of this equation .",

    "thus , all terms in equation ( [ momentum - s ] ) that contain @xmath103 ( i.e. , the first two terms on the right - hand side ) are a factor @xmath104 smaller than the last term on the right - hand side and can be neglected .",

    "it is much smaller than the lorentz force in the transfield direction , consistent with the fact that the field is everywhere close to being force - free in that direction ( especially so in the region near the origin , where thermal effects are most important ) . along the field",
    ", there is a force that is @xmath106 times larger ( namely , the inertial force component associated with the @xmath107 term ) , as in the purely hd case examined in @xcite . in general",
    ", the pressure force is important up to the slow magnetosonic point , where , for highly relativistic temperatures , @xmath108 , and its contribution is negligible in the highly relativistic regime .",
    "one can therefore replace the term @xmath109 by @xmath110 or even completely neglect the pressure - gradient force in the momentum equation without introducing a significant error .    with the above approximations , all the @xmath111 terms in the continuity , momentum , and entropy equations",
    "can be eliminated , and the conservation equations simplify to a steady - state form .",
    "although the label @xmath112 remains attached to the @xmath113 operator , it now serves only to identify a given outflowing shell ( or pulse ) .",
    "the motion remains effectively time independent and can be described as a frozen pulse whose internal profile is specified through the variable @xmath112 . as we noted in  [ introduction ] , the frozen - pulse approximation was first applied to relativistic hd outflows in grb sources by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "two integrals remain to be performed , involving the bernoulli and transfield equations .",

    "such a component is incorporated into solution @xmath384 but is missing in solution @xmath385 .",
    "it is , nevertheless , worth reemphasizing that the dominant energy source even in solution @xmath384 is the poynting flux .",
    "we note in this connection that one of the potential problems of traditional fireball models has been the `` baryon contamination '' issue : why does the highly super - eddington luminosity that drives the fireball not lead to a more significant mass loading of the flow and thereby keep @xmath685 comparatively low ?",
    "if most of the requisite energy were injected in a nonradiative form , then this problem would be alleviated .",
    "the expectation that grb outflows are poynting flux - dominated also renders the slow - rotator ( enthalpy flux - dominated ) solution @xmath1 less relevant to their interpretation than the fiducial solution .",
    "grb outflows are inferred to be highly collimated at large distances from the origin : this has motivated us to construct our fiducial solution in the current - carrying ( @xmath686 ) regime , which is applicable near the symmetry axis ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . however , as demonstrated in figure [ fig3 ] , the illustrative current - carrying solution @xmath386 also becomes well collimated on a similar length scale , so it may also provide an adequate representation of such outflows .",
    "in fact , this regime may be a natural choice for modeling the far - downstream region of the flow since it corresponds to a plausible current - configuration on large scales ; furthermore , as shown in @xcite , it also results in a more efficient acceleration .",
    "we have opted to focus on the current - carrying regime in this paper since the solutions in this case , unlike the return - current solutions formally extends to infinity .",
    "we incorporate the return - current regime into a grb outflow model in @xcite .",
    "our fiducial self - similar `` hot '' solution as well as our `` cold '' relativistic mhd solution ( and the corresponding ones derived by @xcite and @xcite ) have cylindrical asymptotics .",
    "in the nonrelativistic theory , it was shown @xcite that it is possible to derive exact solutions of radially self - similar flows that have either one of the following three types of asymptotes : cylindrical , parabolic , or conical .",
    "although we expect that it should be possible to obtain different asymptotic behaviors also in radially self - similar relativistic flows , this has not yet been studied in detail .",
    "our basic conclusions about the magnetic acceleration of the flow do not , however , depend on the shape of the asymptotic flowlines , although the quantitative constraints on the mass loading ( to assure that the flow is optically thin in the shell - collision region ) would be eased if the flow continued to expand rather than collimated to a cylinder .",
    "grb jets are often modeled in terms of conical jets , and this picture has gained support from observations of a panchromatic break in the light curve of several grb afterglows ( from which jet half - opening angles in the range of @xmath687 to @xmath688 have been inferred ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a sharp physical boundary may not be required for interpreting the data in the context of a beam - patterned outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that a cylindrical jet model could provide a better fit to the light curves of at least some afterglows and might perhaps even be able to account for the panchromatic breaks commonly attributed to a finite jet opening angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if grb jets are not characterized by a global cylindrical geometry , the asymptotically cylindrical solutions that we derived may be applicable to the `` patchy shell '' scenario for variable grb outflows @xcite . in this picture , the outflowing shells are ejected within a given opening angle but do not fill the entire solid angle into which they are injected . in the context of the internal shock model ,",
    "this scenario alleviates the energy requirements on bright bursts ; it is also consistent with the apparent lack of a strong correlation between the prompt high - energy and the afterglow fluences , and it may account for the early - time variability in the afterglow emission of a source like grb 021004 @xcite . in the phenomenological model considered by @xcite , successive blobs of angular scale @xmath689 are ejected randomly within an opening angle of @xmath690 , and the number of blobs ejected along a given direction ( given that more than one is required for the production of internal shocks ) is also taken to be a random number ( distributed uniformly in a predetermined range ) .",
    "this model was intended to mimic the behavior of causally disconnected regions in large - scale ejected shells .",
    "an alternative physical picture is that of a collection of magnetically active regions on the surface of the disk that feed the grb outflow . in this picture , the magnetic field associated with each `` patch '' guides successive `` mini '' shells along roughly congruent paths , thereby enhancing the efficiency of internal - shock production .",
    "however , the ejection directions from different sites need not be parallel to each other , so some of the beamed @xmath90-ray emission may miss the observer : this might contribute to the appearance of quiescent times between grb pulses @xcite .",
    "the high ( @xmath561 ) poynting - to - kinetic energy conversion efficiency exhibited by all our fast - rotator solutions ( solutions @xmath384 , @xmath385 , and @xmath386 ) has made it possible for our models to accommodate the internal - shock emission scenario without requiring a prohibitively large energy input at the source ( see  [ results ] ) .",
    "however , currently available data on the radiated @xmath90-ray energy @xmath691 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the outflow kinetic energy @xmath692 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicate that they are both approximately equal ( @xmath693 ) , are inconsistent with this scenario for any reasonable radiative energy efficiency of such shocks ( see @xcite for further discussion of this issue ) .",
    "one possible resolution of this apparent inconsistency is that the prompt high - energy emission arises directly from electromagnetic energy dissipation without the intermediate step of poynting - to - bulk - kinetic energy conversion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our solutions seem to be consistent with this possibility : they imply that about half of the injected energy is converted into bulk kinetic energy ; if the remaining poynting flux can be efficiently converted into high - energy emission , then this would lead to an approximate equality between @xmath691 and @xmath692 .",
    "@xcite used ideal - mhd equations with parameterized magnetic energy dissipation to demonstrate ( in the context of a strictly radial flow , i.e. , without taking into account the transfield force - balance equation that determines the fieldline shape ) that the poynting - to - radiation energy conversion could in principle be as high as 50% and that the dissipation may also result in significant bulk acceleration .",
    "it would be interesting to combine the approach taken by these authors ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) with the one utilized in this paper to consider the effects of dissipation in a _ nonradial _ flow .",
    "we now briefly compare the results of our exact solutions with some of the previous work on mhd effects in grb outflows .",
    "the incorporation of `` disposable '' magnetic energy into the traditional fireball model was discussed by @xcite .",
    "the behavior that they infer is consistent with our solutions in the regime where @xmath102 ( but not beyond it ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted the outflows in terms of pulsar winds that generate intense electromagnetic waves at the point where the ideal - mhd approximation breaks down .",
    "he highlighted the fact that the lorentz factors of the particles accelerated by such waves could be as high as @xmath694 and thus greatly exceed the terminal lorentz factors ( @xmath695 ) attained in the @xcite ideal - mhd monopole solution .",
    "the acceleration efficiency of our collimating ( and thus nonmonopolar ) ideal - mhd solutions is much higher yet : they yield @xmath696 .",
    "@xcite examined a magnetized conical jet with a pure electron - positron composition .",
    "they deduced ( and our solutions have confirmed ) that the pair ",
    "photon fluid is initially accelerated by thermal pressure , with the magnetic field acting only to guide the flow .",
    "they also pointed out that radiation drag effects allow the pairs and photons to remain coupled even beyond the point where the scattering optical depth drops below 1 and that at some point pair annihilation freezes out .",
    "@xcite subsequently showed that the surviving pairs carry only a fraction @xmath697 of the initial energy , implying that , in the absence of magnetic acceleration , this scenario is extremely inefficient .",
    "we note , however , that if a nonnegligible fraction ( @xmath698 ) of the total injected energy is in magnetic form ( [ with the ratio of magnetic to pairs - plus - photons energy injection rates being @xmath699 , as assumed by @xcite ) , then , based on our `` cold '' solution ( see   [ soln_b ] ) , half of the magnetic energy could be eventually transformed into kinetic energy of the surviving pairs , reaching overall efficiencies @xmath700 . as the rest - mass density of the final pair population , which represents only a tiny fraction of the initial rest - mass density of pairs . ] for @xmath701 this yields an efficiency of @xmath702 , which is significantly higher than the values estimated by @xcite . as was , however , discussed by these authors , the resulting outflow would have a huge lorentz factor and might not by itself be able to reproduce the observed properties of real grbs .",
    "although the presentation in this paper and its companion is focused on the application to grbs , our formalism is quite general and the solutions that we present should be relevant also to other magnetically driven relativistic outflow sources , notably agns and microquasars .",
    "the possible relationship between the different classes of beamed relativistic outflows in astrophysics has already been noted before by various authors .",
    "one potential attraction of adopting a common modeling framework for these outflows is that it could shed new light on each of the different types of sources .",
    "for example , the concept of internal shocks was originally proposed in the context of agn jets @xcite , and it has recently been adopted also for modeling microquasars @xcite . in the latter class of objects ,",
    "there is direct observational evidence ( in the form of correlated x - ray , infrared , and radio flux variations and the appearance of superluminal radio knots ) for a causal connection between a rapid accretion episode onto the central black hole and the ejection of superluminal blobs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is the same basic scenario as the one commonly adopted ( albeit without direct observational support ) for grb outflows .",
    "a similar correlation between the x - ray and radio flux behavior and the appearance of radio - bright superluminal knots was recently discovered also in an agn jet @xcite .",
    "although the observed behavior in this case does not support the notion that agns are a simple scaled - up version of microquasars , this might be attributable to a different origin of the underlying disk instability that induces the accretion / ejection episodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or to different environmental conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is now also evidence that the high - energy ( gev - range ) @xmath90-ray emission in the blazar class of agns originates in superluminal radio knots  which likely represent discrete blobs or shocks in a relativistic jet  at a large distance from the origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is essentially the picture envisioned for grb outflows .",
    "the superluminal knots in blazar jets such as 3c 345 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 3c 279 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are inferred to move along distinct curved paths , although in the former case it has been argued @xcite that at least two of the knots follow each other along the same trajectory .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the `` patchy shell '' model discussed above in connection with grbs .",
    "there are also indications that the outflows continue to accelerate on large scales : for example , the lorentz factor of knot c7 in the quasar 3c 345 was inferred to increase from @xmath703 to @xmath704 as it moved from a distance of @xmath705 from the galactic nucleus to @xmath706 @xcite .",
    "a scaled - down version of this behavior was found in the radio galaxy ngc 6251 , where knots in the radio jets were inferred to accelerate from @xmath707 at @xmath708 to @xmath709 at @xmath710 @xcite .",
    "such large - scale acceleration is most naturally interpreted in terms of a poynting - dominated jet model of the type discussed in this paper ( n. vlahakis & a. knigl , in preparation ) .    in conclusion , we have derived in this paper the general formalism for radially self - similar , relativistic mhd outflows and presented exact solutions ( obtained by solving the euler and transfield equations and imposing regularity conditions at the relevant critical points ) to illustrate their basic properties .",
    "we focused on trans - alfvnic flows , deferring a discussion of super - alfvnic solutions to the companion paper .",
    "we considered `` hot '' and `` cold '' rapid - rotator flows ( the latter reproducing previous results by @xcite and @xcite ) as well as slow - rotator flows in the current - carrying regime ( which should apply near the rotation axis ) , but also described a `` hot , '' fast - rotator solution in the return - current regime . in all cases",
    ", we demonstrated that the poynting flux injected at the source can be transformed with high ( @xmath561 ) efficiency into kinetic energy of relativistic baryons at a large ( but finite ) distance from the origin .",
    "we concentrated on applications to grb outflows , although we pointed out that similar solutions may describe jet acceleration in agns and microquasars . in the application",
    "to grbs , we presented a particular `` hot , '' fast - rotator outflow as a fiducial solution . in this case the outflow is initially accelerated thermally , with the magnetic field acting only to guide and collimate it , but subsequently magnetic effects become fully dominant and are responsible for the bulk of the acceleration ( which occurs between the classical fast - magnetosonic and modified fast - magnetosonic surfaces ) and for the final collimation to cylindrical asymptotics .",
    "we stress , however , that this solution is only illustrative and is not meant to provide an accurate description of a typical grb flow . in this solution is about an order of magnitude higher than the minimum lorentz factors typically inferred in real grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] as we discuss in paper ii , super - alfvnic outflows can also provide plausible representations of grb outflows ; their basic properties , however , are quite similar to those of trans - alfvnic flows .",

    "<S> our results are applicable to relativistic jets in gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources , active galactic nuclei , and microquasars , but our discussion focuses on grbs . </S>",
    "<S> we envision the outflows in this case to initially consist of a hot and optically thick mixture of baryons , electron - positron pairs , and photons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the flow is at first accelerated thermally but that the bulk of the acceleration is magnetic , with the asymptotic lorentz factor corresponding to a rough equipartition between the poynting and kinetic - energy fluxes ( i.e. , @xmath0 of the injected total energy is converted into baryonic kinetic energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic forces also strongly collimate the flow , giving rise to an asymptotically cylindrical structure . </S>"
