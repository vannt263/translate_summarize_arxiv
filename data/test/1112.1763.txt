    "the collapse of lehman brothers and the ongoing eur - zone sovereign debt crisis have brought the details of csa ( credit support annex ) into sharp focus in the pricing problems of financial contracts . according to the survey recently carried out by kpmg  @xcite",
    ", it seems that there is now wide recognition among practitioners that the appropriate discounting rate for the collateralized deals is the corresponding collateral rate .",
    "since the overnight rate is the standard choice for the cash collateral , it is now a market standard to use ois ( overnight index swap ) rate to discount the future cash flows for single - currency domestic trades .",
    "however , as we have already pointed out in the work fujii , shimada & takahashi ( 2010 )  @xcite , the choice of collateral currency does significantly affect the price of derivatives .",
    "this is because non - zero basis spread in ccs ( cross currency swap ) is nothing but the difference of the relative funding cost between the two currencies , which then affects the funding cost of a deal collateralized by a foreign currency .",
    "the problem becomes even more complicated when there exist multiple eligible collateral currencies ( or assets in general ) .",
    "the right of the collateral payer to choose a collateral each time induces _ cheapest - to - deliver option _ to the contract . as we have emphasized in fujii & takahashi ( 2011 )  @xcite , the value of this option can be quite significant when the ccs market is volatile . considering the ongoing concern on eur - zone debt crisis and the historical level of ccs basis spreads , it is easy to imagine that these complexities are evoking disputes on valuation , and hence reducing market transparency and liquidity .    in order to mitigate the problem , isda ( international swaps and derivatives association ) is planning to release scsa ( standard credit support annex )  @xcite in 2012 .",
    "it is now argued that there will be one collateral requirement per currency , delivered in each currency ( or converted to a single currency with an interest adjustment overlay ) so that there is no embedded optionality in collateral agreements . in scsa , each trade will be assigned to one of the five dcc ( designated collateral currency ) silos of g5 currencies : usd , eur , gbp , chf , and jpy . for a trade",
    "involves only a single currency within the above g5 will be assigned to the corresponding currency silo , and collateralized by the same currency . in this case , the discounting rate is simply the ois rate of the same currency .",
    "if a contracting party chooses different currency to post , the collateral rate will be adjusted in such a way that it gives the same economic effects as the standard case .",
    "non - g5 currency as well as multiple - currency trades will be assigned to the usd silo , where the collateralization is done by usd cash , or a different currency with adjusted collateral rate to achieve the same economic effects .    in this note , we discuss the issues of the usd - silo valuation framework .",
    "one possible reason that non - g5 currencies are assigned to the usd silo is the lack of liquid domestic ois markets for these currencies .",
    "if scsa becomes the dominant choice among practitioners , we need to consider the fundamental issues , such as the swap curve construction , interest rates and fx modeling under a peculiar situation , in which most of the trades are collateralized by a foreign currency ( i.e. usd ) , and hence it is impossible to rely on the domestic ois rate for valuation . although the theoretical background was already analyzed in our previous works , we will provide a simple closed framework particularly for the usd silo .",
    "we have also shown that a ccs basis spread can be interpreted as a difference of two swap rates . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the _ clean price _ of the contract without counter party credit risk  .",
    "before going to the details of the usd silo , let us review the valuation under the collateralization by a foreign currency .",
    "see , @xcite for the details .",
    "we will assume the following conditions throughout the paper : + full collateralization ( zero threshold ) by cash .",
    "+ the collateral is adjusted continuously with zero minimum transfer amount ( mta ) .",
    "+   + since the daily margin call with zero threshold and zero mta will be a part of scsa , the above simplification will be a reasonable proxy for the reality .",
    "now let us consider a derivative whose payout at time @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 in terms of currency @xmath2 .",
    "we suppose that currency @xmath3 is used as the collateral for the contract .",
    "note that the instantaneous return ( or cost when it is negative ) of holding cash collateral at time @xmath4 is given by y^(i)(t)=r^(i)(t)-c^(i)(t ) where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the risk - free interest rate and the collateral rate of the currency @xmath3 , respectively . here",
    ", we have used the risk - free rate as the effective investment return or borrowing cost of cash after adjusting all the market and credit risks .",
    "if there remains additional funding cost independent from the credit risk , we need to include fva ( funding value adjustment )  .",
    "however , even in this case , it will not be categorized as the _",
    "clean part _ since it is not agreeable between the two contracting parties , in general .",
    "considering the return from the collateral account as a dividend yield , one can easily see that h^(j)(t)=e_t^q^(j)+f_x^(j , i)(t)e_t^q^(i ) + where @xmath7 is the fx rate at time @xmath4 representing the unit amount of currency @xmath3 in terms of currency @xmath2 , and @xmath8 $ ] denotes the time @xmath4 conditional expectation under the risk - neutral measure of currency @xmath9 , where the money - market account of currency @xmath9 is used as the numeraire .",
    "then it can be checked that the process defined as x(t):=e^-_0^t r^(j)(s)dsh^(j)(t)+_0^t e^-_0^s r^(j)(u)duy^(i)(s)h^(j)(s)ds is a @xmath10-martingale under appropriate technical conditions .",
    "thus , the option price process can be written as dh^(j)(t)=(r^(j)(t)-y^(i)(t))h^(j)(t)dt+dm^q^(j)_t with some @xmath10-martingale @xmath11 . as a result , we have the following pricing formula : h^(j)(t)=e_t^q^(j )  . as a corollary ,",
    "when the collateral and the payment currencies are the same ( i.e. , currency @xmath2 ) , we obtain h^(j)(t)=e_t^q^(j )  .      in the reminder of the paper , we fix currency @xmath3 as usd , and denote ^(j):=r^(j)-y^(i ) as the effective discounting rate under the usd collateralization .",
    "we define the usd collateralized zero coupon bond as ^(j)(t , t)=e_t^q^(j )  .",
    "it is also useful to consider the usd adjusted collateral account defined by ^(j)(t)=(_0^t ^(j)(s)ds )  , and then it is straightforward to check that @xmath12 is a positive @xmath10-martingale .",
    "thus , we can define the usd - collateralized forward measure @xmath13 by .|_t=  . using these notations , the option price in the previous section",
    "can also be written as h^(j)(t)=^(j)(t , t)e^q^(j)_t_t  .",
    "now , let us consider the fx forward contract between currency @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( = usd ) collateralized by usd .",
    "we define the @xmath0-maturing fx forward at time @xmath4 as : + at the current time @xmath4 , the two parties agree to exchange the unit amount of currency @xmath2 with @xmath14 unit of currency @xmath3 at time @xmath0 . + the fx forward rate @xmath15 is the amount of @xmath14 that makes the present value of the above exchange at time @xmath4 zero .",
    "+ from the above description , the corresponding @xmath14 should satisfy f_x^(i , j)(t)e^q^(j)_t = e^q^(i)_tand hence f_x^(i , j)(t , t)=f_x^(i , j)(t ) [ fxfwd ] where the usd zero coupon bond collateralized by the usd cash is defined by d^(i)(t , t)=e^q^(i)_t  . for the later purpose ,",
    "let us define the measure @xmath16 by .|_t= where ^(i)(t)=(_0^t c^(i)(s)ds )  .",
    "then , it is easy to check that @xmath17 is a @xmath18-martingale , and hence f_x^(i , j)(t , t)=e^q^(i)_t_tfor @xmath19 .",
    "similar calculation gives the fx forward between the two non - usd currencies @xmath20 under the usd silo as f_x^(j , k)(t , t)=f_x^(j , k)(t )  .",
    "note that the fx forward does depend on the choice of collateral currency .",
    "although we have a currency triangle relation f_x^(i , j)(t , t)f_x^(j , k)(t , t)=f_x^(i , k)(t , t ) within the usd silo , it is not true once we mix different collateral currencies , in general .",
    "if all the multi - currency trades are allocated to the usd silo in the scsa , the complexity associated with the violation of currency triangle under the current csa will be significantly reduced once scsa becomes the standard choice among practitioners  .",
    "we assume that there exist an fixed - versus - libor interest rate swap market of currency @xmath2 and a @xmath21-mtmccs ( mark - to - market cross currency swap ) market . both types of contracts",
    "are assumed to be usd collateralized .",

    "in scsa , non - g5 currencies will be assigned to the usd silo and collateralized by the usd cash . however ,",
    "if usd is the unique eligible collateral , it may induce liquidity squeeze and raise the usd funding cost under stressed market conditions . in order to mitigate the problem ,",

    "at the moment , ois still lacks liquidity relative to the standard irs .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that it will be more liquid as the increase of the use of cash collateral and associated standard csa in otc and ccp markets . in many non - g5 markets , even in some of the g5 , advanced foreign financial firms are playing an important role as dominant suppliers of derivatives . for these players , particularly after scsa gains popularity , managing the market risks of various currencies under usd collateralization will be one of their central concerns .",
    "in addition , the recognition of non - negligible credit risk even for the banks in the libor panel now calls the usefulness of libor as the reference index for the wide market participants into serious question . considering the difficulty to separately manage its embedded risks on top of those associated with collateral rates",
    ", we think that it is not unrealistic that ois ( rather than irs ) will gain much higher liquidity in coming years .",
    "based on these considerations , we think it is worthwhile studying the possible future developments of usd - collateralized ois and mtmccois markets   and their implications .",
