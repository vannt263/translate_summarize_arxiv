    "ground states of quantum systems with many constituents are typically entangled . in a similar manner",
    "as one can identify characteristic length scales of correlation functions , quantum correlations are expected to exhibit some general scaling behavior , beyond the details of a fine - grained description .",
    "such characteristic features provide a physical picture that goes beyond the specifics of the underlying microscopic model .",
    "a central question of this type is the following : if one distinguishes a certain collection of subsystems , representing some spatial region , of a quantum many - body system in a pure ground state , the state of this part will typically have a positive entropy , reflecting the entanglement between this region and the rest of the system @xcite .",
    "this degree of entanglement is certainly expected to depend on the size and also on the shape of the region . yet , how does the degree of entanglement specifically depend on the size of the distinguished region ?",
    "in particular , does it scale as the volume of the interior  which is meant to be the number of degrees of freedom of the interior ? or , potentially as the area of the boundary , i.e. , the number of contact points between the interior and the exterior ?",
    "this paper provides a detailed answer to the scaling behavior of the entanglement of regions with their exterior in a general setting of harmonic bosonic lattice systems and provides a comprehensive treatment of upper bounds on these quantities .",
    "we find that in arbitrary spatial dimensions the degree of entanglement in terms of the von  neumann entropy scales asymptotically as the area of the boundary of the distinguished region .",
    "this paper significantly extends the findings of ref.@xcite on harmonic bosonic lattice systems : there , the area - dependence of the geometric entropy has been proven for cubic regions in non - critical harmonic lattice systems of arbitrary dimension with nearest - neighbor interactions , corresponding to discrete versions of klein - gordon fields . in this paper",
    "we extend our analysis to a general class of finite - ranged harmonic interactions and also take regions of arbitrary shape into account . for thermal gibbs states ,",
    "the entropy of a reduction is longer a meaningful measure of entanglement . instead",
    ", an area - dependence for an appropriate mixed - state entanglement measure , the distillable entanglement , is established .",
    "also , an analogous statement holds for classical correlations in classical systems .",
    "the area - dependence is even found in certain cases where one can prove the divergence of the two - point correlation length .",
    "this demonstrates that this previously conjectured dependence between area and entanglement is valid under surprisingly general conditions .",
    "the presented analysis will make use of methods from the quantitative theory of entanglement in the context of quantum information science @xcite .",
    "it has been become clear recently that on questions about scaling of entropies and degrees of entanglement  albeit often posed some time ago  new light can be shed with such methods @xcite . in this language ,",
    "quantum correlations are sharply grasped in terms of rates that can be achieved in local physical transformations . to assess quantum correlations using novel powerful tools from quantum information and to relate them to information - theoretical quantities constitutes an exciting perspective .    in the context of quantum field theory ,",
    "such questions of scaling of entropies and entanglement have a long tradition under the keyword of geometric entropy .",
    "in particular , work on the geometric entropy of free klein - gordon fields was driven in part by the intriguing suggested connection @xcite to the bekenstein - hawking black hole entropy @xcite . in seminal works by bombelli et al .",
    "@xcite and srednicki @xcite the relation between the entropy and the boundary area of the region has been suggested and supplemented with numerical arguments .",
    "this connection has been made more specific using a number of different methods .",
    "in particular , for half spaces in general and intervals in the one - dimensional case , the problem has been assessed employing methods from conformal field theory , notably @xcite , based on earlier work by cardy and peschel @xcite , and by cardy and calabrese @xcite .    in one - dimensional non - critical chains , one observes a saturation of the entanglement of a distinguished block , as was proven analytically for harmonic chains @xcite and was later observed for non - critical spin chains numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite . in turn , in critical systems systems , one often ",
    "but not always  finds a logarithmically diverging entropy @xcite . in case of a model",
    "the continuum limit of which leads to a conformal field theory , the factor of the logarithmically diverging term is related to the central charge of the conformal field theory .",
    "the findings of the present paper and of the above - mentioned results motivate further questions concerning the general area - dependence of the degree of entanglement , for example in fermionic systems @xcite . in particular , the connection between the geometric entropy fulfilling no area law and the correlated quantum many - body system being critical is not fully understood yet .",
    "this is particularly true for the interesting case of more than one - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start , in section [ major ] , with a presentation of the major results of the paper . in section  [ prelims ] we define our notation and recall some basics on harmonic lattice systems .",
    "section [ bounds ] provides a general framework of upper and lower bounds for entanglement measures , expressed in terms of the spectrum of the hamiltonian and two - point correlation functions .",
    "this analysis is performed both for the case of the ground state as well as for mixed gibbs states .",
    "of particular interest are hamiltonians with finite - ranged interactions in section [ sectionfiniteranged ] . for such hamiltonians",
    ", we first study the behavior of the two - point correlation functions , then the entanglement bounds . in section  [ nomore ] , discussing the gibbs state case , we determine temperatures above which there is no entanglement left .",
    "a class of examples of hamiltonians which exhibit a divergent two - point correlation length in their ground state , but an area - dependence of the entanglement is presented in section  [ divergent ] and expressed in analytical terms .",
    "the specific case of hamiltonians the interaction part of which can be expressed as a square of a banded matrix is discussed in section [ thasquared ] . in this case , very explicit expressions for entanglement measures can be found .",
    "we then consider , in section [ classical ] , the case of classical correlations in classical harmonic systems with arbitrary interaction structure .",
    "interestingly , this case is related to the quantum case for squared interactions in the sense of section  [ thasquared ] .",
    "finally , we summarize what has been achieved in the present paper , and present a number of open questions in this context .",
