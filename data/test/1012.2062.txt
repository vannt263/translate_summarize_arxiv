    "there is a vast literature on epidemics on complex networks ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "most of the epidemic models consider a transmission mechanism which is independent of the local condition faced by the agents concerned .",
    "however , if there is a factor of coordination or persuasion involved , relative considerations tend to be important in understanding whether some new belief or behavior is adopted @xcite . to fix ideas , it may be useful to think of the diffusion process as modeling the adoption of a new technology . in this case , when an agent is confronted with the possibility of adoption , her decision depends on the persuasion effort exerted on her by each of her neighbors in the social network .",
    "more formally , those neighborhood effects can be captured as follows : the probability that an agent adopts the new technology when @xmath0 out of her @xmath1 neighbors have already adopted can be modeled by a threshold function : this probability is one if @xmath2 and it is zero otherwise . for @xmath3 , this would correspond to a local majority rule .",
    "more generally , some simple models for the diffusion of a new behavior have been proposed in term of a basic underlying model of individual decision - making : as individuals make decisions based on the choices of their neighbors , a particular pattern of behavior can begin to spread across the links of the network @xcite , @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the diffusion in the large population limit when the underlying graph is a random network with given vertex degrees .",
    "there is now a large literature on the study of complex networks across different disciplines such as physics @xcite , mathematics @xcite , sociology @xcite , networking @xcite or economics @xcite .",
    "there is also a large literature on local interaction and adoption externalities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "similarly to these works , we study a game where players payoffs depend on the actions taken by their neighbors in the network but not on the specific identities of these neighbors . our most general framework ( presented in section [ sec : mod ] ) allows to deal with threshold games of complements , i.e. a player has an increasing incentive to take an action as more neighbors take the action .",
    "the main contribution of our paper is a model which allows us to study rigorously semi - anonymous threshold games of complements with local interactions on a complex network .",
    "we use a very simple dynamics for the evolution of the play : each time , agents choose the strategy with best payoff , given the current behavior of their neighbors .",
    "stochastic versions of best response dynamics have been studied extensively as a simple model for the emergence of conventions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a key finding in this line of work is that local interaction may drive the system towards a particular equilibrium in which all players take the same action .",
    "most of the literature following @xcite , @xcite is concerned with stochastic versions of best response dynamics on fixed networks and a simple condition known as risk dominance @xcite determines whether an innovation introduced in the network will eventually become widespread . in this case , bounds on the convergence time have been computed @xcite , @xcite as a function of the structure of the interaction network . in this paper , we focus on properties of deterministic ( myopic ) best response dynamics .",
    "in such a framework , as shown in @xcite , coordination on the risk dominant strategy depends on the network structure , the dynamics of the game and the initial configuration . in particular , this coordination might fail and equilibria with co - existent strategies can exist .",
    "this was shown in @xcite already in the simple case where the underlying network is the two - dimensional lattice . while the results in @xcite depend very much on the details of the particular graph considered",
    ", @xcite derives general results that depend on local properties of the graphs .",
    "more formally , agents are nodes of a fixed infinite graph and revise their strategies synchronously .",
    "there is an edge @xmath4 if agents @xmath5 and @xmath6 can interact with each other .",
    "each node has a choice between two possible behaviors labeled @xmath7 and @xmath8 . on each edge @xmath4",
    ", there is an incentive for @xmath5 and @xmath6 to have their behaviors match , which is modeled as the following coordination game parametrized by a real number @xmath9 : if @xmath5 and @xmath6 choose @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) , they each receive a payoff of @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) ; if they choose opposite strategies , then they receive a payoff of @xmath12 .",
    "then the total payoff of a player is the sum of the payoffs with each of her neighbors .",
    "if the degree of node @xmath5 is @xmath13 and @xmath14 is her number of neighbors playing @xmath8 , then the payoff to @xmath5 from choosing @xmath7 is @xmath15 while the payoff from choosing @xmath8 is @xmath16 .",
    "hence the best response strategy for agent @xmath5 is to adopt @xmath8 if @xmath17 and @xmath7 if @xmath18 .",
    "a number of qualitative insights can be derived from this simple diffusion model @xcite .",
    "clearly , a network where all nodes play @xmath7 is an equilibrium of the game as is the state where all nodes play @xmath8 .",
    "consider now a network where all nodes initially play @xmath7 and a small number of nodes are forced to adopt strategy @xmath8 ( constituting the seed ) .",
    "other nodes in the network apply best - response updates , then these nodes will be repeatedly applying the following rule : switch to @xmath8 if enough of your neighbors have already adopted @xmath8",
    ". there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to @xmath8 such that a network - wide equilibrium is reached in the limit .",
    "in particular , contagion is said to occur if action @xmath8 can spread from a finite set of players to the whole population .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there is a contagion threshold such that contagion occurs if and only if the parameter @xmath10 is less than the contagion threshold . in particular",
    "the contagion threshold is always at most @xmath19 so that @xmath8 needs to be the risk - dominant action in order to spread .",
    "however this condition is not sufficient and @xcite gives a number of characterizations of the contagion threshold and also shows that low contagion threshold implies the existence of equilibria where both actions are played .",
    "most of the results on this model are restricted to deterministic infinite graphs and the results in @xcite depend on local properties of graphs that need to be checked node - by - node . in networks exhibiting heterogeneity among the nodes",
    ", this approach will be limited in its application . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the diffusion in the large population limit when the underlying graph is a random network @xmath20 with @xmath21 vertices and where @xmath22 is a given degree sequence ( see section [ sec : conf ] for a detailed definition ) .",
    "although random graphs are not considered to be highly realistic models of most real - world networks , they are often used as first approximation and are a natural first choice for a sparse interaction network in the absence of any known geometry of the problem @xcite .",
    "our analysis yields several insights into how the diffusion propagates and we believe that they could be used in real - world situations . as an example , we show some implications of our results for the design of optimal advertising strategies .",
    "our results extend the previous analysis of global cascades made in @xcite using a threshold model .",
    "they differ greatly from the study of standard epidemics models used for the analysis of the spread of viruses @xcite where an entity begin as susceptible and may become infected and infectious through contacts with her neighbors with a given probability . already in the simple coordination game presented above , we show that connectivity ( i.e. the average number of neighbors of a typical agent ) plays an ambiguous role : while it allows the diffusion to spread , when the network is highly connected , the diffusion is also limited by high - degree nodes , which are very stable .",
    "these nodes require a lot of their neighbors to switch to @xmath8 in order to play @xmath8 themselves .    in the case of a sparse random network of interacting agents ,",
    "we compute the contagion threshold in section [ sec : cont ] and relate it to the important notion of _ pivotal players_. we also show the existence of ( continuous and discontinuous ) phase transitions . in section [ sec : eq ] , we analyze the possible equilibria of the game for low values of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we give conditions under which an equilibrium with coexistence of large ( i.e. containing a positive fraction of the total population ) connected sets of players @xmath7 and @xmath8 is possible . in section [ sec : ad ] , we also compute the minimal size of a seed of new adopters in order to trigger a global cascade in the case where these adopters can only be sampled without any information on the graph .",
    "we show that this minimal size has a non - trivial behavior as a function of the connectivity . in section [ sec : lmf ] , we give a heuristic argument allowing to recover the technical results which gives some intuition behind our formulas .",
    "our results also explain why social networks can display a great stability in the presence of continual small shocks that are as large as the shocks that ultimately generate a global cascade .",
    "cascades can therefore be regarded as a specific manifestation of the robust yet fragile nature of many complex systems @xcite : a system may appear stable for long periods of time and withstand many external shocks ( robustness ) , then suddenly and apparently inexplicably exhibit a large scale cascade ( fragility ) .",
    "our paper is divided into two parts .",
    "the first part is contained in the next section .",
    "we apply our technical results to the particular case of the coordination game presented above .",
    "we describe our main findings and provide heuristics and intuitions for them .",
    "these results are direct consequences of our main theorems stated and proved in the second part of the paper .",
    "this second part starts with section [ sec : mod ] , where we present in details our most general model of diffusion ( where initial activation and thresholds can vary among the population and also be random ) .",
    "this general model allows to recover and extend results in the random graphs literature and is used in @xcite for the analysis of the impact of clustering .",
    "we also state our main technical results : theorem [ th : epi ] and theorem [ prop : cascade ] .",
    "their proofs can be found in sections [ sec : thepi ] and [ sec : casc ] respectively .",

    ", for the erds - rnyi graph @xmath53 with @xmath54 , our results will hold with the limiting probability distribution @xmath51 being a poisson distribution with mean @xmath52 .",
    "an interesting perspective is to understand how different network structures are more or less hospitable to cascades .",
    "going back to the diffusion model described in the introduction , we see that the lower @xmath10 is , the easiest the diffusion spreads . in @xcite , the contagion threshold of a connected infinite network ( called the cascade capacity in @xcite )",
    "is defined as the maximum threshold @xmath55 at which a finite set of initial adopters can cause a complete cascade , i.e. the resulting cascade of adoptions of @xmath8 eventually causes every node to switch from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "there are two possible models to consider depending whether the initial adopters changing from @xmath7 to @xmath8 apply or not best - response update .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the same contagion threshold arises in both models . in this section ,",
    "we consider a model where the initial adopters are forced to play @xmath8 forever . in this case , the diffusion is monotone and the number of nodes playing @xmath8 is non - decreasing .",
    "we say that this case corresponds to the _ permanent adoption model _ : a player playing @xmath8 will never play @xmath7 again .",
    "we will discuss a model where the initial adopters also apply best - response update in section [ sec : eq ] .    to illustrate the notion of contagion threshold , consider the infinite network depicted on figure [ fig : counter34 ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the contagion threshold for such a network is @xmath56 , the same as for the @xmath57-dimensional lattice .",

    "a @xmath0-regular random graph is connected w.h.p , so that for any @xmath104 , an initial adopter will cause a complete cascade ( i.e. reaching all players ) . in particular , in this case , the only possible equilibria of the game are all players playing @xmath7 or all players playing @xmath8",
    ". we will come back to the analysis of equilibria of the game in section [ sec : eq ] .",
    "given a degree distribution @xmath51 , proposition [ prop : cap ] gives the typical value of @xmath105 under the uniform distribution on graphs with the prescribed degree distribution .",
    "a question of interest is to find among all graphs with a given degree sequence , which ones achieve the lowest or highest value of the contagion threshold .",
    "indeed , the contagion threshold of a graph can be seen as a proxy for its susceptibility to cascades : the higher the contagion threshold is , the more susceptible the graph is to cascading behavior . clearly if @xmath106 is the maximal degree in the graph , we have @xmath107 . in the case of regular graphs , we saw that the typical contagion threshold is equal to this lower bound : @xmath108 .",
    "note however that there are examples of regular graphs in @xcite with a strictly higher threshold ( see figure 3 there : a @xmath109-regular graph with contagion threshold @xmath110 ) .",
    "hence among all @xmath0-regular graphs , picking a graph at random will give w.h.p . a graph which is the least susceptible to cascades among those @xmath0-regular graphs .",
    "however it is not always the case that picking a graph at random among all graphs with a given degree sequence will result in the least susceptible one .",
    "there are situations where the typical value of the contagion threshold exceeds the lowest possible value : this is the case in the example presented above in figure [ fig : counter34 ] for which the contagion threshold is @xmath111 whereas the sequence of random graphs @xmath20 with asymptotic degree distribution such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 has a contagion threshold of @xmath64 . the recent work @xcite has a similar focus .     for erds - rnyi random graphs and for power law graphs ( dashed curve ) as a function of the average degree @xmath52 .",

    ", we can apply our results with @xmath116 for all @xmath47 , i.e. the poisson distribution with mean @xmath52 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : qc ] ( left ) for the case of erds - rnyi random graphs @xmath53 , @xmath55 is well below @xmath117 , indeed we have @xmath118 for any value of @xmath52 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : qc ] ( right ) , we see that @xmath55 is a non - decreasing function of @xmath52 the average degree in the graph for @xmath119 .",
    "clearly on figure [ fig : qc ] ( left ) , @xmath55 is a non - increasing function of @xmath52 , for @xmath120 .",
    "the second curve in figure [ fig : qc ] corresponds to the contagion threshold for a scale - free random network whose degree distribution @xmath121 ( with @xmath122 ) is parametrized by the decay parameter @xmath123 .",
    "we see that in this case we have @xmath124 . in other words , in an erds - rnyi random graph , in order to have a global cascade , the parameter @xmath10 must be such that any node with no more than four neighbors must be able to adopt @xmath8 even if it has a single adopting neighbor . in the case of the scale free random network considered , the parameter @xmath10 must be much lower and any node with no more than nine neighbors must be able to adopt @xmath8 with a single adopting neighbor .",
    "this simply reflects the intuitive idea that for widespread diffusion to occur there must be a sufficient high frequency of nodes that are certain to propagate the adoption .",
    "we also observe that in both cases , for @xmath10 sufficiently low , there are two critical values for the parameter @xmath52 , @xmath125 such that a global cascade for a fixed @xmath10 is only possible for @xmath126 .",
    "the heuristic reason for these two thresholds is that a cascade can be prematurely stopped at high - degree nodes . for erds - rnyi random graphs , when @xmath127 , there exists a giant component , i.e. a connected component containing a positive fraction of the nodes .",
    "the high - degree nodes are quite infrequent so that the diffusion should spread easily . however , for @xmath52 close to one , the diffusion does not branch much and progresses along a very thin tree , `` almost a line '' , so that its progression is stopped as soon as it encounters a high - degree node . due to the variability of the poisson distribution ,",
    "this happens before the diffusion becomes too big for @xmath128 .",
    "nevertheless the condition @xmath129 is not sufficient for a global cascade .",
    "global diffusion also requires that the network not be too highly connected .",
    "this is reflected by the existence of the second threshold @xmath130 where a further transition occurs , now in the opposite direction . for @xmath131 ,",
    "the diffusion will not reach a positive fraction of the population .",
    "the intuition here is clear : the frequency of high - degree nodes is so large that diffusion can not avoid them and typically stops there since it is unlikely that a high enough fraction of their many neighbors eventually adopts .",
    "following @xcite , we say that these nodes are locally stable .     of the cascade ( in percent of the total population ) for erds - rnyi random graphs as a function of @xmath52 the average degree for a fixed @xmath132 .",
    "the lower curve gives the asymptotic fraction of pivotal players @xmath133.,width=170 ]    the proof of our theorem [ prop : cascade ] makes previous intuition rigorous for a more general model of diffusion and gives also more insights on the nature of the phase transitions .",
    "we describe it now .",
    "the lower curve in figure [ fig : cascade ] represents the number of pivotal players in an erds - rnyi random graph as a function of @xmath52 the average connectivity for @xmath134 : hence we keep only the largest connected component of an erds - rnyi random graph where we removed all vertices of degree greater than @xmath135 . by the same heuristic argument as above , we expect two phase transitions for the size of the set of pivotal players . in the proof of theorem [ prop : cascade ] , we show that it is indeed the case and moreover that the phase transitions occur at the same values @xmath136 and @xmath130 as can be seen on figure [ fig : cascade ] where the normalized size ( i.e. fraction ) @xmath133 of the set of pivotal players is positive only for @xmath137 .",
    "hence a cascade is possible if and only if there is a giant component of pivotal players .",
    "note also that both phase transitions for the pivotal players are continuous , in the sense that the function @xmath138 is continuous .",
    "this is not the case for the second phase transition for the normalized size of the cascade given by @xmath139 in proposition [ prop : cap ] : the function @xmath140 is continuous in @xmath136 but not in @xmath130 as depicted on figure [ fig : cascade ] .",
    "this has important consequences : around @xmath136 the propagation of cascades is limited by the connectivity of the network as in standard epidemic models . but around @xmath130 , the propagation of cascades is not limited by the connectivity but by the high - degree nodes which are locally stable .     of the cascade ( in percent of the total population ) for erds - rnyi random graphs as a function of the frequency of the cascade.,width=170 ]    to better understand this second phase transition , consider a dynamical model where at each step a player is chosen at random and switches to @xmath8 .",
    "once the corresponding cascade is triggered , we come back to the initial state where every node play @xmath7 before going to the next step .",
    "then for @xmath52 less than but very close to @xmath130 , most cascades die out before spreading very far .",
    "however , a set of pivotal players still exists , so very rarely a cascade will be triggered by such a player in which case the high connectivity of the network ensures that it will be extremely large .",
    "as @xmath52 approaches @xmath130 from below , global cascades become larger but increasingly rare until they disappear implying a discontinuous phase transition . for low values of @xmath52 , the cascades are infrequent and small .",
    "as @xmath52 increases , their frequencies and sizes also increase until a point where the cascade reaches almost all vertices of the giant component of the graph .",
    "then as @xmath52 increases , their sizes remain almost constant but their frequencies are decreasing .",
    "we considered so far the permanent adoption model : the only possible transitions are from playing @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "there is another possible model in which the initial adopters playing @xmath8 also apply best - response update .",
    "we call this model the _ non - monotonic _ model ( by opposition to the permanent adoption model ) . in this model ,",
    "if the dynamic converges , the final state will be an equilibrium of the game .",

    "this paper analyzes the spread of new behaviors or technologies in large social networks .",
    "our analysis is motivated by the two qualitative features of global cascades in social and economics systems : they occur rarely , but are large when they do .    in our simplest model , agents play a local interaction binary game where the underlying social network is modeled by a sparse random graph . considering the deterministic best response dynamics ,",
    "we compute the contagion threshold for this model .",
    "we find that when the social network is sufficiently sparse , the contagion is limited by the low connectivity of the network ; when it is sufficiently dense , the contagion is limited by the stability of the high - degree nodes .",
    "this phenomenon explains why contagion is possible only in a given range of the global connectivity .",
    "most importantly , we identify the set of agents able to trigger a large cascade : the pivotal players , i.e. the largest component of players requiring a single neighbor to change strategy in order to follow the change .",
    "the notion of pivotal player is crucial in the context of random graphs .",
    "cascades occur only when pivotal players represent a positive fraction of the population and in this case , any cascade will be triggered by such a pivotal player .",
    "we found that these pivotal players exist only if the connectivity of the network is in a given range . at both ends of this range ( i.e. for low and high - connectivity ) ,",
    "the number of pivotal players is low .",
    "however in the high - connectivity case , we found that the system displays a robust - yet - fragile quality : while pivotal players are very rare , they trigger very large cascades .",
    "this feature makes global contagions exceptionally hard to anticipate .",
    "we also analyze possible equilibria of the game and in particular , we find conditions for the existence of equilibria with co - existent conventions .    motivated by social advertising , we also consider cases where the number of pivotal players is a negligible fraction of the population . in this case , contagion is still possible if the set of initial adopters is sufficiently large .",
    "we compute the final size of the contagion as a function of the fraction of the initial adopters .",
    "we find that the low and high - connectivity cases still have different features : in the first case , the global connectivity helps the spread of the contagion while in the second case , high connectivity inhibits the global contagion but once it occurs , it facilitates its spread .",
    "finally , we analyze a general percolated threshold model for the diffusion allowing to give different weights to the ( anonymous ) neighbors .",
    "our general analysis gives explicit formulas for the spread of the diffusion in terms of the initial condition , the degree sequence of the random graph , and the distribution of the thresholds .",
    "it is hoped that this analysis will stimulate applications of our results to other practical cases .",

    "<S> we consider a model of diffusion where the individuals behavior is the result of a strategic choice . </S>",
    "<S> we study a simple coordination game with binary choice and give a condition for a new action to become widespread in a random network . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the possible equilibria of this game and identify conditions for the coexistence of both strategies in large connected sets . </S>",
    "<S> finally we look at how can firms use social networks to promote their goals with limited information . </S>",
    "<S> our results differ strongly from the one derived with epidemic models and show that connectivity plays an ambiguous role : while it allows the diffusion to spread , when the network is highly connected , the diffusion is also limited by high - degree nodes which are very stable .    </S>",
