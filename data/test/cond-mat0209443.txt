    "macroscopic particles suspended in an isotropic fluid - colloidal dispersions - have been the subject of intensive study for over a century @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel class of materials have been realised in which colloidal particles are dispersed in _",
    "fluids , typically thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "the combination of anisotropy and long - range order inherent in these mesophases leads to totally new kinds of interactions between the dispersed particles , which have no analogues in conventional colloidal dispersions @xcite .",
    "the most important of these new interactions results from the elastic deformation induced by a particle in the liquid crystalline host .",
    "the overlap of the the elastic deformations of two particles produces an effective long - ranged interaction between them .",
    "this mechanism , which relies only on the _ mean _ distortions of the order parameter , implies that other sources of deformation like topological defects also interact with particles through long - range forces .",
    "fluctuations of the order parameter together with the boundary conditions on the particle surface lead to another novel kind of casimir - like interaction @xcite , which can often be important near special points in the phase diagram . in particle - doped nematics , for instance ,",
    "director fluctuations lead to a casimir force which is stronger than the van der waals force near the isotropic - to - nematic transition @xcite .",
    "interparticle interactions are further complicated by the inevitable presence of topological defects surrounding the particles @xcite .",
    "these defects compensate the mismatch in the boundary conditions imposed on the order parameter at the particle surface and at infinity . to clarify with an example , a particle in a nematic with director - normal boundary conditions on its surface is equivalent to a radial hedgehog with unit positive topological `` charge '' , and is incompatible with the requirement of an uniform director configuration at infinity .",
    "the mismatch is relieved by the spontaneous appearance of a defect of unit negative `` charge '' , which is tightly bound to the particle .",
    "such companion defects usually lead to rapidly decaying , repulsive , power law forces between the particles @xcite .",
    "the interactions mentioned above , when combined with the multitude of interactions already present in conventional colloidal dispersions @xcite , can drive the particles into spatially organised structures - chains @xcite , clusters @xcite , and even crystalline arrangements @xcite have been observed for particles in nematic hosts .    as a result of these novel interactions , the static and dynamic properties of ( with an obvious extension of terminology ) _ liquid crystalline colloids _ are quite unusual .",
    "the change in the mechanical properties is particularly dramatic - particles added in volume fractions as low as several percent can totally alter the rheological behaviour of the host phase @xcite .",
    "when the particles have a magnetic moment interesting ferro - liquid crystalline phases are formed @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical studies have been done on these and related effects in nematic colloids @xcite .",
    "comparatively less work has been done on particle - doped lamellar phases @xcite .",
    "it is therefore surprising that in spite of recent experiments @xcite , there has been no theoretical study of the properties of particle - doped columnar phases . in the following sections of this paper , therefore , as a first step towards a more detailed theory , we calculate the elastic field mediated interparticle interactions ( section [ effective ] ) , as well as the interactions of particles with point topological defects ( section [ topological ] ) .",
    "we conclude the paper with a critical discussion of our results and possible extensions of the present work .",
    "let us recall that the columnar phase is macroscopically equivalent to a regular array of tubes , aligned in , say , the @xmath0 direction ( directions in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane are denoted as @xmath3 ) and free to slide along their axes .",
    "a cross - sectional slice normal to the tubes shows a two - dimensional crystal structure , which , for the case we study , is hexagonal .",
    "mechanically , the phase is liquid - like in the @xmath0 direction , and solid - like and isotropic in the @xmath3 directions .",
    "elastic deformations are described by a pair of `` broken - symmetry '' variables @xmath4 corresponding to the local displacements of the tubes from their equilibrium position .",
    "to lowest order in gradients , the harmonic free energy density includes contributions from in - plane bulk and shear deformations , and out - of - plane column curvatures @xcite : @xmath5.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are first - order elastic constants ( with dimensions of energy density ) corresponding to bulk and shear deformations respectively , while @xmath8 is a second - order elastic constant ( with the dimension of force ) corresponding to column curvature .",
    "an elastic description of this sort is valid at length scales large compared to the column spacing @xmath9 .",
    "the colloidal particles are modelled as monodisperse spheres of radius @xmath10 and are described by a concentration field @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the center - of - mass coordinate of the @xmath13th particle .",
    "a description of this sort is valid at length scales large compared to the particle radius @xmath10 , when in effect , the particles can be treated as point masses . in this dilute limit , where the typical distance between particles is much larger than their size , all short - range interactions can be ignored , and the particles need to be assigned only an ideal gas entropy . as in the theory of point defects in three dimensional crystals , it is assumed that the particles behave as force dipoles ( `` centers of dilation or compression '' ) @xcite and produce a body force proportional to @xmath14 at the point @xmath15 .",
    "this is equivalent to a coupling of the form @xmath16 in the free energy , where @xmath17 is the local dilation .",
    "it is not difficult to see that to linear order in @xmath18 and lowest order in gradients , this is the only possible symmetry - allowed coupling of the concentration to the column displacement @xcite . with these considerations , then , the free energy density ( in units of @xmath19 ) is @xmath20 + \\alpha c({\\bf r})e({\\bf u}).\\ ] ] the second term in ( [ fullf ] ) accounts for the entropy of the particles whose mean concentration is @xmath21 .",

    "the fourier transform @xmath39 of the kernel @xmath40 can be obtained explicitly in terms of modified bessel functions @xcite , but we prefer the integral representation given above .",
    "the potential @xmath41 presents several interesting features .",
    "it is non - central ( not a function of @xmath42 only ) and radially non - monotonic .",
    "this last property prevents us from inferring the sign of the radial component of the force from that of the potential .",
    "therefore , the attractive or repulsive character of the interaction can not be correlated with the sign of the potential , and the forces have to be considered explicitly . however , in the @xmath0 and @xmath3 directions the potential _ is _ monotonic and decays with a power law . near the @xmath0-axis ( for @xmath43 ) the potential vanishes as @xmath44 , leading to a rapidly damped and repulsive force along the columns.near the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ( for @xmath45 ) the potential decays more slowly as @xmath46 , implying a repulsive force in the @xmath3 direction . in a general direction the nature of the interaction is best visualised through the plot of the equipotentials of @xmath41 shown in fig.[cplot1 ] . from the plot it is clear that the radial component of the force is positive near the @xmath0-axis and the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , and negative in the region bounded by the two paraboloids @xmath47 .",
    "broadly speaking , the force felt by a particle at @xmath48 due to another particle at the origin varies from repulsive , to attractive , to repulsive again as the polar angle @xmath49 varies from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "since the potential is even in @xmath0 , the sequence repeats as the angle decreases from @xmath52 to @xmath51 .",

    "the potential is even in @xmath0.,width=264,height=264 ]    given the nature of the interparticle forces described above , we might expect an attraction induced aggregation of the particles . however , repulsive forces due to the companion topological defects mentioned in the introduction may dominate at short distances , and arrest the aggregation . in that case , it is likely that particles will spontaneously organise in chains oblique to the columns",
    ". this process will be dominated by brownian motion , and not the elastic interaction , which though long - ranged , decays too rapidly to affect the kinetics of aggregation .",
    "the correction to the interparticle potential due to a finite density of particles may be calculated quite easily within a mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "augmenting the free energy @xmath55 with an external potential @xmath56 which couples to the concentration , the equilibrium concentration is obtained by demanding @xmath57 .",
    "this gives @xmath58.\\ ] ] the mean ( or effective ) potential is defined by @xmath59 . using this to eliminate the density from the previous equation and identifying the external potential with that of a fixed particle at the origin ,",
    "we obtain the following self - consistent equation for @xmath60 : @xmath61.\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath62 we can linearise the above integral equation . neglecting the term corresponding to the background concentration and fourier transforming we find @xmath63 the mean potential is of the same functional form as the `` bare '' interparticle potential , but with a `` renormalised '' characteristic length @xmath64 .",
    "recalling that a similar calculation with a coulomb potential @xmath65 leads to charge screening @xcite , we must conclude that , despite the long - ranged interaction , many - particle effects are quite modest in our case .      in the absence of interactions the particles in our model have only configurational entropy and their two - point correlations are like those of an ideal gas : @xmath66 . however , elastic interactions lead to quite complex correlations , as we show below .",
    "defining the dimensionless structure factor @xmath67 as the fourier transform of @xmath68 we find from the effective free energy in ( [ eff1 ] ) that @xmath69 the fourier transform of the pair correlation function @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath71 , and therefore the pair correlations themselves are well described by the contour plot of fig.[cplot1 ] with all the signs reversed .",
    "the correlations are negative along the @xmath0 and @xmath3 axes , indicating a reduction in the particle concentration compared to the mean value of @xmath21 , while in the region bounded by the paraboloids @xmath72 the correlations are positive , indicating an enhancement of the concentration .",
    "this is broadly consistent with our earlier picture of particle chains oblique to the columns . it may be possible to measure the particle structure factor by small - angle x - ray scattering , and the form of @xmath73 above",
    "would then provide a test of the particle - column coupling assumed in our theory .",
    "while the column displacements induce particle correlations , the particle aggregates in turn modify the column fluctuations . in particle - doped lamellar phases",

    "this requires that we modify the particle - column coupling to @xmath75 .",
    "next , we define an effective free energy @xmath76 for the column fluctuations ( in a way similar to the definition of @xmath55 ) by integrating out the concentration field . carrying out the integration by steepest descent we obtain the effective free energy @xmath77.\\ ] ]",
    "this shows that the coefficients of all symmetry - allowed terms which contain @xmath78 are `` renormalised '' by the presence of particles . within our harmonic description",
    "the only relevant term , obtained by expanding the exponential term to quadratic order , is @xmath79 . retaining only this term in ( [ eff2 ] ) and defining the longitudinal and transverse parts of @xmath80 as @xmath81 and @xmath82 we obtain the @xmath83 correlations as @xmath84 @xmath85 the transverse correlations are identical to those of the pure columnar phase , which indicates that there are no corrections to @xmath7 and @xmath8 due to the particles .",
    "the longitudinal correlations while identical in form , have a modified bulk modulus @xmath86 .",
    "particles thus produce a softening of the columnar phase .",
    "topological defects are common in liquid crystalline phases , being easily produced under conditions of processing such as shear flows.much of the interesting macroscopic behaviour of liquid crystalline colloids comes from the interaction of the colloidal particles with the topological defects of the host @xcite . for example , the solid - like response of particle - doped cholesteric @xcite and smectic @xcite phases is due to the formation of a stable network of defects .",
    "the colloidal particles play the crucial role of _ stabilising _ this network , which otherwise would anneal away .",
    "it is likely that elastic interactions do not play a dominant role in such processes , and that short - range forces , not captured in a coarse - grained description such as ours , are more important .",
    "nevertheless , elastic interactions between particles and topological defects are known to have important consequences @xcite , and so in what follows , we calculate this interaction for a point defect configuration in the columnar phase .",
    "the statistical mechanics of thermally activated point defects @xcite may be modified in the presence of particles and a knowledge of particle - defect interactions could be potentially useful in a study of this phenomenon . an interesting duality ( see below ) between the columnar and lamellar phases has been noted by de gennes and prost @xcite and explored in detail by selinger and bruinsma @xcite .",
    "this suggests that it may be of interest to compare particle - defect interactions in the lamellar and columnar phases and we conclude this section with such a comparison .",

    "[ hexdefect ] .",
    "this is not unduly restrictive , since any linear defect which consists of column endings ( eg . a transverse edge dislocation ) can be constructed out of a collection of such point defects @xcite .",
    "the ease with which a column can break depends on what constitutes the `` column '' , and therefore , on what the particular realisation of the columnar phase is . in polymeric columnar phases ,",
    "the columns consist of long chains arranged end - to - end along their length . here",
    ", thermally activated column scission can occur only at those places where one end of a chain meets that of another .",
    "( polymeric liquid crystals are found predominantly in the nematic and isotropic phases ; however , longer and stiffer biopolymers like dna can also positionally order into columnar phases @xcite ) .",
    "since columns in discotic and micellar phases are composed of weakly bonded molecules , thermally activated scission can take place anywhere along the length of the columns . in all of these examples ,",
    "the column scission energy is finite and thus a state of thermal equilibrium at non - zero temperature will always contains a finite number of such defects .",
    "the ends of a scissioned column may either separate along the @xmath0-axis to form a string of vacancies , or may translate past each other in the @xmath3 direction to form a string of interstitials @xcite .",
    "such strings will begin from and end on the column extremities , the lower of which , by convention , is called a `` tail''(fig .",
    "[ hexdefect ] ) and the upper a `` head '' @xcite . at high temperatures",
    "the entropy of wandering of the string can overcome the energy due to its line tension , leading to a string proliferation , and producing isolated `` heads '' or `` tails '' @xcite .",

    "since defect motion is one of the main mechanisms of stress relaxation in ordered phases , less mobile defect strings may lead to an increase in the viscosity of the columnar phase .",
