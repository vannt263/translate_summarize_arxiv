    "because globular cluster stars are faint , they are difficult to study at high spectral resolution . thus , metallicity - sensitive indices have been devised from photometric and low- to medium - resolution data in order to study large samples of clusters .",
    "zinn & west ( 1984 ; `` zw84 '' ) provided the first truly extensive data set based on metallicity - sensitive photometric indices of integrated cluster light .",
    "most recently , rutledge et al ( 1997a , b ) , employed infra - red ( `` ir '' ) ca  ii triplet features in low - resolution spectra of individual cluster giant stars .",
    "regardless of the method employed , both indices require calibration to high - resolution abundance analyses of [ fe / h ] .",
    "metallicity estimates for other clusters are then derived by interpolating the correlation of the observed values of the indices and [ fe / h ] determinations .",
    "the resulting metallicity scale therefore depends upon the reliability of the [ fe / h ] determinations of nearby key clusters .    at the present time , two competing calibrations based on high resolution",
    "spectroscopic analyses exist .",
    "zw84 employed the high resolution studies of cohen ( 1978 , 1979 , 1980 , 1981 ) and supplemented the results by butler s ( 1975 ) measurements of @xmath2@xmath3 determinations for rr lyrae stars .",
    "later , in a study by carretta & gratton ( 1997 ; `` cg97 '' ) , ccd - based equivalent width ( `` ew '' ) measurements were adjusted to a common system in order to define a new metallicity scale . cg97",
    "employed a common set of fe  i _",
    "gf_-values , kurucz ( 1992 , 1993 ) model atmospheres with overshooting , and a uniform colour - effective temperature ( `` t@xmath4 '' ) relationship ( gratton et al 1996 ) for 160 stars in 24 globular clusters .",
    "the difference in the metallicity scales , in the sense of @xmath2[fe / h ] = _ cg97 _  _ zw84 _ , is 0.1  dex for metal - rich clusters and @xmath5 + 0.2  dex for metal - poor clusters .      in the five years",
    "since the cg97 scale was established , there have been new developments that affect the abundance analysis of metal - poor giants , and thus the metallicity scale of globular clusters .",
    "first , new scales of colour versus t@xmath4 have been devised , one by alonso et al ( 1999 ) based on the ir flux method ( blackwell et al 1990 ) , and another by houdashelt et al ( 2000 ) who modelled broad - band colours as a function of t@xmath4 and stellar surface gravity ( `` log  _ g _ '' ) .",
    "second , consideration of the effects of non - local thermodynamic equalibrium ( `` non - lte '' ) suggests that the assumption of lte ionization equilibrium between fe  i and fe  ii may be invalid ; iron may be overionized in the atmospheres of metal - poor giant stars ( see e.g.  thvenin & idiart 1999 ; `` ti99 '' ) .",
    "finally , new cluster distance moduli based on _ hipparcos _ ( esa 1997 ) parallaxes for nearby subdwarfs has led to slightly increased globular cluster distances , which has slightly decreased the estimates of log  _ g _ in globular cluster stars .      by `` metallicity '' , we make the usual assumption that it is equivalent to [ fe / h ] as derived from high resolution analyses . in the past , [ fe / h ]",
    "has normally been based on the abundance derived from fe  i lines , or on the mean of the abundances derived from both fe  i and fe  ii lines .",
    "however , in a detailed study of lte models of metal - poor stellar atmospheres , ti99 concluded that abundance analyses of fe  i underestimate the abundance of iron . at any given optical depth , the populations of the atomic levels of fe  i are affected by the outward leakage of higher energy photons from inner layers ; the local kinetic temperature is not in equilibrium with the radiation field .",
    "the result is that iron is overionized .",
    "but , in such atmospheres , fe  ii is by far the dominant species and is essentially unaffected by departures from lte .",
    "so , the effect of this lack of equilibrium , while serious for fe  i , is negligible for fe  ii .",
    "thus , metallicities for globular clusters can safely be based on lte analysis of fe  ii .",
    "this is supported by 3-dimensional atmosphere modelling by asplund & garcia perez ( 2001 ) and nissen et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "although the analyses vary widely in cluster sample size , high resolution abundance analyses for giant stars in over 30 globular clusters can be found in the literature .",
    "many giants are in common to multiple investigations . these stars provide information from which t@xmath4 and log  _ g _ transformations can be estimated .",
    "we focussed our attention on those clusters in which a reasonable number of fe  ii lines ( @xmath64 ) were measured in each giant star analyzed and to those clusters in which at least three giants were studied .",
    "the clusters studied by the lick - texas group ( see kraft & ivans 2003 for all of the references employed ; `` ki-03 '' ) usually proved to include results for more stars in a given cluster than those included by other groups .",
    "in addition , the fe linelists and _ gf_-values chosen varied considerably from group to group .",
    "thus , we focussed our attention on 16 clusters , uniformly analyzed for fe  ii abundances mostly by the lick - texas group , ranging in metallicity 2.5 @xmath7 [ fe / h]@xmath0 @xmath7 0.7 .",
    "the present results are based on more than 150 stars .    in order to put the clusters on the same metallicity scale",
    ", we needed to make adjustments to the input parameters .",
    "the following considerations were incorporated : ( i ) the adopted solar fe abundance ; ( ii ) the derivation of _",
    "gf_-values for fe  i and fe  ii ; ( iii ) estimates of interstellar reddening ; ( iv ) the assignment of t@xmath4 ; ( v ) estimates of cluster moduli and stellar masses ; and ( vi ) the determination of log  _ g_. the lick - texas group studies , which made up the bulk of our sample , are based on analyses employing marcs models ( gustafsson et al 1975 ) .",
    "thus , we also derived transformations to kurucz models , both with and without overshooting .",
    "we adopted the colour - t@xmath4 relationship of alonso et al but also derived the offsets that need to be applied if one employs the houdashelt et al calibration instead .",
    "details of the strategy we devised are found in ki-03 ( their  3 and table  5 ) .    in column",
    "( 3 ) of table  [ table1 ] , we display the true distance moduli we derived for five key clusters on the basis of _ hipparcos_-based distances to low - metallicity subdwarfs .",
    "column ( 2 ) shows the metallicity we derived .",
    "details regarding the method of the analysis , including the adoption of t@xmath4 , log  _ g _ , _",
    "gf_-values , the solar model , and log  @xmath8(fe)@xmath9 , are presented in ki-03 .",
    "_ metal - rich clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath11 0.65 ) : _ most of the globular clusters more metal - rich than those included in our estimations lie in or near the galactic bulge , are obscured by interstellar dust , and have not been studied extensively at high resolution . extrapolating the correlations given in ",
    "[ calibrate ] predicts values of [ fe / h]@xmath0 0.3  0.5 dex lower than the measured metallicities in the literature .",
    "we refer the reader to further discussion in ki-03 ( their  9 ) .",
    "if fe is a surrogate for `` metallicity '' , then metallicity should be represented by the dominant species of fe . in the case of giant stars in globular clusters , the dominant species , by far ,",
    "is fe  ii .",
    "use of fe  i for this purpose is troublesome due to possible departures from lte . summarizing the discussion in ki-03 ( their  10 ) , we make the following recommendations in the determinations of [ x / fe ] ratios for globular cluster giant stars :    * c , n , and o are all overwhelmingly in the neutral state .",
    "their abundances should be derived from indicators of the abundance of the neutral species and should be normalized to the abundance of iron based on fe  ii . *",
    "elements such as ti , sc , ba , and eu , derived from features due to the singly ionized state , should have their [ x / fe ] values normalized to the iron abundance based on fe  ii .",
    "* other neutral elements which may suffer from effects of over - ionization similar to that of iron , should be normalized to abundance of iron based on fe  i.      there exists no  definitive \" set of cluster metallicities that are systematically reliable on the 0.05  dex level .",
    "any discussion of cluster abundances ( galactic or extragalactic ) must state clearly the underlying assumptions concerning the stellar atmosphere models used ; the adopted t@xmath4-scale ; what is meant by  metallicity \" ( eg .",
    "fe  ii ? or a mean thereof ? ) ; what is the method used to derive log  _ g _ ; and the origin of _ gf_-values .",
