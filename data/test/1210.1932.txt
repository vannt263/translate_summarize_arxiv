    "the theory of persistent homology builds a bridge between computational algebraic topology and data analysis using homology as an effective tool to associate a computable invariant to a point cloud .",
    "other applications of the theory range from coverage problems in sensor networks to complex network theory .",
    "the main idea is to approximate the point cloud embedded in a metric space with an increasing sequence of simplicial complexes ( filtration ) , see @xcite . by analysing the persistent , i.e. long living , homological features in the filtration ,",
    "the shape of the point cloud can be inferred .",
    "multipersistent homology is a generalization of this theory in which the homology of a filtration of simplicial complexes indexed by @xmath0 ( multifiltration ) is analysed .",
    "a multifiltration represents a simplicial complex evolving along @xmath1 different directions .",
    "multipersistent homology has been introduced by carlsson and zomorodian in the seminal paper @xcite , where the authors study the classification problem for multipersistence homology modules . from then , several papers have considered these modules : the same authors and singh in @xcite developed an algorithm for computing their grbner bases @xcite and chacholski et al .",
    "@xcite gave a combinatorial multigraded resolution for multipersistence homology modules .",
    "the classification problem has been studied in @xcite .",
    "a particular type of multifiltration is highlighted in @xcite and called one - critical .",
    "intuitively , in the one critical case , simplices enter the filtration in one single instance rather than in non comparable states . the algorithm in @xcite works on one - critical multifiltrations",
    "optimally and on general ones , reducing them to the one - critical case by using the mapping telescope .    as observed by the authors in @xcite the mapping telescope increases the size of the multifiltration exponentially in the worst case .    therefore , although the algorithm in @xcite has polynomial complexity in the one - critical case , the use of the mapping telescope introduces a bottleneck in the general case . in this paper",
    ", we give a new presentation of multipersistence modules . by using this , we are able to extend a version of the algorithm presented in @xcite to all multipersistence modules avoiding the use of the mapping telescope and therefore eliminating the bottleneck of the previous approach .",
    "our algorithm has polinomial complexity for all multifiltrations and in the one - critical case it essentially coincides with the one in @xcite .",
