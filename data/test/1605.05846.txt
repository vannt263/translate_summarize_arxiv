    "entanglement and nonlocality are two manifestations of quantum correlations , both are essential ingredients of quantum theory .",
    "they also play an important role in the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "for instance , entanglement is in the heart of quantum teleportation and plays a crucial role in quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "nonlocality , on the other hand , witnessed by the violation of bell inequalities  @xcite , reduces communication complexity @xcite and enables device - independent quantum information protocols  @xcite .",
    "these protocols do not rely on a detailed knowledge of the internal working of the experimental devices used , thereby allowing secure cryptography involving untrusted devices  @xcite or expansion of secure random numbers  @xcite .",
    "the quantification of entanglement and nonlocality in the bipartite case ( i.e. , the case when two parties share an entangled state ) is relatively well understood .",
    "however , the multipartite case is much less explored .",
    "this is mainly due to the rapidly growing complexity of the problem with the number of parties .",
    "for instance , for bipartite pure states , there is a unique measure of entanglement , however , for three or more parties , this is not true any more ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "concerning nonlocality , there is a single tight bell inequality for two binary settings per party , the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) one @xcite .",
    "however , moving to three parties , the number of tight bell inequalities already becomes 42 @xcite .",
    "in fact , determining all bell inequalities for growing number parties is an np - hard problem @xcite .",
    "bipartite and tripartite quantum nonlocality are different from a fundamental point of view as well .",
    "while gleason s theorem can be extended to the bipartite scenario , however , there remains a gap between the quantum and gleason s correlations in the tripartite scenario @xcite .",
    "one of the most famous multipartite quantum states is the w state @xcite playing a crucial role in the physics of the interaction between light and matter .",
    "up to now , w states have been prepared in lots of experiments , e.g. , photonic experiments can generate and characterize six qubit entangled states  @xcite .",
    "more recently , genuine 28-particle entanglement was detected in a dicke - like state ( a generalization of the w state ) in a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite .",
    "w states are very robust to losses , hence suited to quantum information applications such as quantum memories @xcite .",
    "for instance , by tracing out all but two parties from an @xmath0-party w state , the remaining two - qubit state is still entangled , no matter how big @xmath0 is .",
    "hence , the w state shows a high persistency of entanglement against particle loss ( actually , the highest possible persistency among @xmath0 qubit states  @xcite ) .    on the other hand",
    ", one may wonder how robust the nonlocality of the w state is with respect to particle loss . in order to quantify this , ref .",
    "@xcite introduces the persistency of nonlocality of @xmath0-party quantum states @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which is the minimal number of particles to be removed for nonlocal quantum correlations to vanish .",
    "@xcite investigates this measure for various classes of multipartite states including w states up to @xmath5 with two settings per site . in this paper",
    ", we bound this value both from above and from below for any @xmath0-qubit w states . to do this",
    ", we refine the definition of @xmath4 to account for bell nonlocality involving @xmath6 settings per party .",
    "this quantity will be called @xmath7 . clearly , in the limit of large @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 tends to @xmath4 .",
    "our main result concerns the case of @xmath8 and we prove the bounds of @xmath9 for @xmath0 large , featuring a relatively small gap between the upper and lower bounds . the lower bound is based on an explicit construction of a class of bell inequalities .",
    "we also give a numerical framework to put reliable lower bounds on @xmath10 beyond two settings ( up to @xmath11 ) and a tractable number of @xmath0 parties .",
    "this numerical study supports that our analytical lower bounds for @xmath12 are tight .",
    "there are recent papers which discuss the robustness of dicke states @xcite ( and in particular the w state ) to various types of noises @xcite .",
    "lower bounds also follow from these papers for the value of @xmath12 . in particular , we obtain considerable improvement over the lower bounds presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "notably , the persistency of nonlocality also gives a device - independent bound on the persistency of entanglement introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . other device - independent approaches to quantify multipartite entanglement including w states appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , multipartite",
    "w states are promising candidates to close the detection loophole  @xcite in multipartite bell tests  @xcite .",
    "such bell violations would complement the experimental loophole - free violations obtained recently in the bipartite case  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ setup ] introduces notation . section  [ ub ] proves a simple upper bound on the persistency of nonlocality @xmath13 for w states and in general for any permutationally symmetric state with two settings per party ( case @xmath8 ) . on the other hand",
    ", section  [ lb ] presents lower bound values based on numerical investigations . to this end",
    ", we first outline the numerical method , then show results for @xmath8 and also beyond @xmath8 up to @xmath11 . in section",
    "[ family ] , a family of bell inequalities is presented ( valid for any number of parties @xmath0 ) , which allows us to obtain good lower bounds for @xmath12 .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion in section  [ disc ] .",
    "let us imagine the following bell setup  @xcite .",
    "a quantum state @xmath3 is shared between @xmath14 spatially separated systems , on which the local observers can conduct measurements .",
    "we focus on binary outcome measurements in which case we may define the joint correlators by the following set of expectation values : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we identify @xmath18 and @xmath19 refers to the @xmath20th @xmath21-valued observable of party @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding real vector of correlators defines a point in the @xmath23 dimensional space of probabilities .",
    "each member of the set  ( [ correlators ] ) has an order , which is given by the amount of parties @xmath24 involving a non - trivial observable ( i.e. not involving @xmath18 ) .",
    "in particular , those with @xmath25 are usually called full - correlators , while those with @xmath26 are called one - body correlators or marginal terms .    a multipartite ( 2-outcome ) bell inequality  @xcite is a linear function of the above correlators  ( [ correlators ] ) , @xmath27    where we denote by @xmath28 the bound which holds for any local hidden variable model .",
    "these are the correlations which the parties can simulate by merely using local strategies and some shared classical information .",
    "the local correlations attainable this way forms a polytope , the so - called bell polytope , whose extremal points consist of those vectors in ( [ bellineq ] ) in which all correlators factorize , that is , @xmath29 and the mean value of each single party @xmath30 , @xmath31 equals either @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "let us define the persistency of nonlocality of a multipartite state @xmath3 according to ref .",
    "@xcite as follows .",
    "let us take the partial trace over @xmath34 systems @xmath35 , and denote the @xmath36-party reduced state by @xmath37 .",
    "the persistency of nonlocality of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is defined as the minimal @xmath38 such that the reduced state @xmath39 becomes local for at least one set of subsystems @xmath40 . in other words ,",
    "the correlators  ( [ correlators ] ) obtained from local measurements @xmath19 on @xmath37 do not violate any bell inequality .    if we allow at most @xmath6 different measurement settings in the bell expression  ( [ bellineq ] ) , we arrive at @xmath41 which provides a lower bound to @xmath4 and for @xmath42 recovers @xmath4 .    in this paper , we focus on computing @xmath41 for the noiseless @xmath0-qubit w state @xcite , @xmath43 , where @xmath44    we may consider this state as a state of an atomic ensemble , and we assume that @xmath38 particles are lost from this ensemble . in that case",
    ", the reduced state contains @xmath36 particles , and the density matrix reads @xmath45 since the w state is permutationally symmetric , the reduced state @xmath46 does not depend on the particular set of subsystems removed , which simplifies considerably the analysis of @xmath10 .",
    "in the next section we provide an upper bound of @xmath2 for @xmath47 in case of arbitrary even @xmath0 number of parties , whereas in sec .",
    "[ lb ] we bound this quantity by @xmath1 from below .",
    "we first prove the following lemma :    [ lbound ] let us have a @xmath48-qudit permutationally invariant state , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by tracing out any @xmath14 qudits , the remaining @xmath14-qudit system @xmath52 can not violate any two - setting @xmath14-party bell inequality with arbitrary number of outcomes .",
    "we take @xmath53 and denote the @xmath14-qudit reduced state of an @xmath0-qudit permutationally invariant state @xmath3 by @xmath37 and the two measurements conducted on station @xmath54 by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . by permutationally invariance we mean that the exchange of any two qudits of the @xmath0-qudit state @xmath3 does not change the state itself .",
    "then , the @xmath14-particle joint probability distribution reads @xmath57 it is not difficult to see that the same probability distribution can be achieved in the following way : let us redistribute the permutationally invariant state @xmath3 between @xmath14 parties such that the @xmath22th qudit pair @xmath58 belongs to party @xmath54 ( so that each party owns two qudits ) .",
    "then party @xmath22 performs measurement @xmath59 on the first qudit and measurement @xmath60 on the second qudit of the @xmath22th pair .",
    "this generates the same distribution as of eq .",
    "( [ half ] ) . since for any @xmath22 these two measurements act on different subspaces , they are commuting .",
    "however , bell inequality violation is not possible ( with any number of outcomes ) if the two alternative measurements for each party are pairwise commuting @xcite .",
    "since the w state is a permutationally invariant multiqubit state ( with local dimension @xmath61 ) , lemma  1 above directly applies to our situation , hence we get the upper bound @xmath62 for @xmath8 with @xmath53 . in other words , @xmath63 for even @xmath0 .",
    "some notes are in order .",
    "( i ) it is straightforward to extend lemma  1 to more than two settings as well . for multiple settings , we get the general upper bound @xmath64 with @xmath65 . however , we conjecture that these upper bounds are not tight in general . for @xmath8 ,",
    "a gap between the lower and upper bound values for the @xmath66-qubit w states are supported by a numerical study performed in sec .",
    "for @xmath6 infinite , the trivial upper bound @xmath67 follows by plugging @xmath68 in the above formula .",
    "if this bound happened to be tight , it would imply that the two - qubit reduced state @xmath69 of the @xmath70 state was bell nonlocal . for large @xmath0",
    "this is very unlikely , since the weight of the entangled part @xmath71 goes to zero .",
    "in fact , a recent computer study in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the state @xmath72 is local for @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , a. amirtham conjectures in ref .",
    "@xcite that the state @xmath74 is local for @xmath75 .",
    "\\(ii ) the permutational invariance property of the state is crucial in the above state .",
    "if the multipartite state does not possess this high symmetry , e.g. it only obeys translational invariance , the above theorem does not hold true any more .",
    "let us illustrate this with a simple example .",
    "we consider a 4-qubit translationally invariant state @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "let us trace out particles @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( constituting half of the 4 particles ) , and as a result we get a maximally entangled pair of qubits , which violates maximally the bipartite chsh - bell inequality  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , translationally invariant systems also impose certain restrictions which can be exploited in bell scenarios as studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we now give a numerical procedure which allows us to get useful ( and often tight ) lower bounds to @xmath10 .",
    "we note that this procedure with some modification can also be applied to generic permutationally invariant multiqubit states .",
    "we consider the bell violation of the following one - parameter family of states : @xmath80 notice that the state  ( [ rhonp ] ) reproduces ( [ rhonk ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "hence , given an @xmath14-party @xmath6-setting bell inequality which is violated by state  ( [ rhonp ] ) with a given critical value , @xmath82 , we get the following lower bound on the persistency : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , where @xmath85 maps a real number @xmath86 to the largest previous integer . hence , in order to get good lower bounds to @xmath10 our task reduces to get good upper bounds to @xmath82 . to this end , we introduce the following linear programming based numerical method .",
    "let us stick to @xmath8 settings ( generalization to more settings is straightforward ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all parties measure the same qubit observables , that is , @xmath87 for @xmath88 . moreover , due to symmetry of the states , we assume these observables are coplanar , lying on the @xmath89 equatorial plane . other works ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) maximizing bell functionals using the w state rely on the same symmetry considerations . with this simplification",
    ", we have two optimization parameters .",
    "hence , for the state @xmath90 and the above measurements , the @xmath91-dimensional correlation point @xmath92 given by the set of correlators  ( [ correlators ] ) is defined by two angles .",
    "likewise , we define the correlation point @xmath93 generated by the same measurements and the state @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ correlators ] ) .",
    "geometrically , the correlations accessible in a local hidden variables theory form a polytope , the so - called bell polytope , with vertices defined by deterministic classical strategies for a fixed scenario of @xmath14 parties and @xmath6 settings ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the two correlation points @xmath93 and @xmath92 are situated within this space .",
    "since the product state @xmath95 is local , point @xmath93 sits inside the bell polytope , whereas point @xmath92 depends on the two measurement angles and may well fall outside the bell polytope ( see fig .",
    "[ bellpolytope ] ) . for a given @xmath96 in ( [ rhonp ] ) , the corresponding correlation point is @xmath97 , and @xmath82 is given by the intersection of the line joining points @xmath93 and @xmath92 with the boundary of the polytope ( see figure  [ bellpolytope ] ) . given the two measurement angles , standard linear programming allows us to compute @xmath82 and the underlying facet , which corresponds to a bell inequality .",
    "[ figgeom ]   corresponding to the @xmath70 state is outside the bell polytope , whereas the point @xmath93 corresponding to the product state falls inside the bell polytope .",
    "@xmath82 is fully determined by points @xmath98 and the facets of the polytope.,title=\"fig : \" ]    clearly , the above described procedure works for @xmath99 as well . in particular , we have chosen a given bell scenario ( @xmath14 parties , @xmath6 settings ) and by varying the @xmath6 angles , we maximized the value of @xmath82 .",
    "we note that this search is a heuristic one and as such it is not guaranteed to terminate in a global maximum of @xmath82 .",

    "in addition , we had to resort to a symmetrization procedure of the bell polytope introduced in @xcite which considerably reduces the complexity of the problem in order to attain @xmath100 .    plugging the @xmath82 values shown in fig .",
