    "it has been well established that neutrinos have nonzero masses as shown in the neutrino oscillation measurements  @xcite although they are massless particles in the standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "since the scale of neutrino masses is much different from that of the other fermion masses , they might be generated by a different mechanism from the one for the other fermions .",
    "usually , the possibility that neutrinos are majorana fermions is utilized as a characteristic feature of the neutrino masses .",
    "the most popular example is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite where very heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos are introduced .",
    "however , lepton number violation which is caused by masses of the majorana neutrinos has not been discovered .",
    "thus it is worth considering the possibility that neutrinos are not majorana fermions but dirac fermions similarly to charged fermions .",
    "the neutrinophilic two higgs doublet model  ( @xmath4thdm ) is a new physics model where neutrinos are regarded as dirac fermions . the second @xmath1-doublet scalar field which couples only with right - handed neutrinos @xmath5",
    "was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for majorana neutrinos .",
    "phenomenology in the model of majorana neutrinos is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . the neutrinophilic doublet field is also utilized for dirac neutrinos  @xcite where a spontaneously broken @xmath3 parity is introduced in order to achieve the neutrinophilic property .",
    "smallness of neutrino masses are explained by a tiny vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) of the neutrinophilic scalar without extremely small yukawa coupling constant for neutrinos . instead of the @xmath3 parity , the model in ref .",
    "@xcite uses a global @xmath2 symmetry that is softly broken in the scalar potential .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry forbids majorana mass terms of @xmath5 , and then neutrinos are dirac fermions can also be acceptable as soft breaking terms of the @xmath2 , the lepton number conservation may be imposed to the lagrangian . ] .",
    "we refer to the model in ref .",
    "@xcite as the @xmath4thdm .",
    "the new particle which was discovered at the lhc  @xcite is likely to be the sm higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "it opens the new era of probing the origin of particle masses .",
    "then it would be a natural desire to expect that the origin of neutrino masses are also uncovered .",
    "if the neutrinophilic scalars in the @xmath4thdm  exist within the experimentally accessible energy scale  ( namely the tev - scale ) , decays of the neutrinophilic charged scalar into leptons can provide direct information on the neutrino mass matrix because it is proportional to the matrix of new yukawa coupling constants for the neutrinophilic scalar field  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the smallness of a new vev which is relevant to dirac neutrino masses is interpreted by the smallness of a soft - breaking parameter of the global @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "it seems then better to have a suppression mechanism for the soft - breaking parameter by extending the @xmath4thdm  with tev scale particles including a dark matter candidate .",
    "the existence of dark matter has also been established in cosmological observations  @xcite , and it is an important guideline for constructing new physics models .    the reason why the neutrino masses are tiny can be explained by a mechanism that the interaction of neutrinos with the sm higgs boson is generated via a loop diagram involving a dark matter candidate in the loop while the interaction is forbidden at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "notice that smallness of neutrino masses in such radiative mechanisms does not require new particles to be very heavy .",
    "similarly , if neutrino masses arise from a new vev , smallness of neutrino masses can be explained by assuming that the vev is generated at the loop level by utilizing a dark matter candidate  @xcite . in this paper",

    "in the @xmath4thdm , the sm is extended with the second @xmath1-doublet scalar field @xmath6 which has a hypercharge @xmath7 and right - handed neutrinos @xmath8  ( @xmath9 ) which are singlet fields under the sm gauge group .",
    "a global @xmath2 symmetry is introduced , under which @xmath6 and @xmath8 have the same nonzero charge while the sm particles have no charge .",
    "then , the yukawa interaction with @xmath6 is only the following one : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the lepton flavor and @xmath12 are the pauli matrices . since majorana mass terms",
    "@xmath13 are forbidden by the @xmath2 symmetry , there appears an accidental conservation of the lepton number where lepton numbers of @xmath6 and @xmath14 are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "we rely on an additional scalar @xmath43 which is a singlet field under the sm gauge group . similarly to the singlet majoron model  @xcite where a vev of a singlet field spontaneously breaks the lepton number conservation by two units , the nambu - goldstone boson from @xmath43 is acceptable  @xcite ; the nambu - goldstone boson couples first with only neutrinos among fermions . if @xmath2-charges of @xmath6 and @xmath43 are @xmath44 and @xmath16 , respectively , a dimension-5 operator @xmath45 is allowed by the @xmath2 symmetry although @xmath46 is forbidden .",

    "<S> we extend the scalar sector of the neutrinophilic two higgs doublet model , where small masses of dirac neutrinos are obtained via a small vacuum expectation value @xmath0 of the neutrinophilic @xmath1-doublet scalar field which has a yukawa interaction with only right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> a global @xmath2 symmetry is used for the neutrinophilic nature of the second @xmath1-doublet scalar field and also for eliminating majorana mass terms of neutrinos . by virtue of an appropriate assignment of the @xmath2-charges to new particles </S>",
    "<S> , our model has an unbroken @xmath3 symmetry , under which the lightest @xmath3-odd scalar boson can be a dark matter candidate . in our model , @xmath0 is generated by the one - loop diagram to which @xmath3-odd particles contribute . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss a possible signature of our model at the lhc . </S>"
