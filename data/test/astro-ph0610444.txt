    "in the relativistic jets of agns or grbs , the observed flux is related to their intrinsic flux by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is doppler factor , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the observed and intrinsic flux respectively , and @xmath4 is the spectral index ( ( * ? ? ? * blandford & knigl 1979 ) ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is greater than 1 , then the observed flux will be enhanced , which is called doppler boosting effect . on the other hand , if @xmath5 is less than 1 , the observed flux is attenuated , which is named to doppler deboosting effect .",
    "the doppler factor of a jet can be described by the following equation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the velocity , @xmath8 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath9 is the viewing angle .    for a counter relativistic jet where @xmath10 , the doppler factor @xmath1 is always less than 1 , which can easily be derived from equation  [ eqn1 ] .",
    "so a counter jet is always doppler deboosted . for a forward relativistic jet ,",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "provided that the viewing angle of jet @xmath11 ( when @xmath12 , @xmath1 is always greater that 1 ) , the doppler factor can be greater than 1 as well as less than 1 ( see figure  [ fig01 ] for detail ) .",
    "therefore , both doppler boosting and deboosting effects could happen in forward jets .",
    "in many radio loud agns , the large scale jets share some common features in their profiles .",
    "firstly , there are compact and bright cores in the center of jets .",
    "secondly , adjacent to the cores , the flux of the jets drops down very quickly , even form some gaps where the jets are undetectable .",
    "thirdly , the jets will be re - brightened in the outer region .",
    "recently , the swift found some interesting properties in grbs .",
    "five grbs x - ray light curves are characterized by a rapid fall - off for first few hundred seconds , followed by a less rapid decline lasting several hours .",
    "the light curves also show discontinuity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tagliaferri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) ) .",
    "@xcite found that there were bright x - ray flares in grb afterglows .",
    "* stage i : the jets are accelerating and boosting , which relates to the bright cores of agns and the bursts of grbs .",
    "the initial acceleration of relativistic jets has been detected in 3c 273 by @xcite and modeled by @xcite . in this stage",
    ", @xmath8 is usually less than a few tens , and @xmath1 increase very quickly . *",
    "stage ii : the jets are accelerating but deboosting .",
    "as the acceleration continues , @xmath8 will be very large ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , the jets will enter into the deboosting area , i.e. @xmath14 . in this stage ,",
    "the observed flux of the jets decreases very quickly , and often forms the gaps between inner and outer jets in agns and the rapid decays and discontinuous light curves in grbs .",
    "* stage iii : the jets are decelerating and boosting .",
    "the acceleration , however , wo nt last forever because of radiation loss and the interaction between the jets and the surrounding medium . thus , the jets will decelerate and their @xmath1 will increase again . consequently , the doppler boosted jets will appear again in the profiles of agns or in the light curves of grbs . *",
    "stage iv : the jets are decelerating and deboosting . finally , due to the same reasons in stage iii",
    ", the jets will gradually disappear .",
