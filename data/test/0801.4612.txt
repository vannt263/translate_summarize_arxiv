    "the post - agb phase is a short period in the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath4 ) between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and the planetary nebula ( pn ) phases .",
    "the theoretical evolutionary tracks of the central stars @xcite predict that this phase lasts @xmath5 yrs , depending on the core mass , yet even shorter kinematical age for nebulosities , of order of @xmath6 yrs @xcite .",
    "shorter kinematical life time is obvious from the observational point of view since the entire shell ( especially an extended cold shell of post - agb object ) is not necessarily detected at the optical wavelength .",
    "many significant changes occur during this phase to both the star and the nebula .",
    "the superwind ( suddenly increased mass loss at the end of the agb phase ) stops , large amplitude pulsations cease and the circumstellar envelope slowly expands and cools revealing the central star .",
    "the post - agb star evolves at constant luminosity on the hertzsprung - russell diagram towards higher temperatures .",
    "the morphology of the expanding envelope changes , resulting in the fascinating shapes of the nebula itself .",
    "despite many efforts the post - agb phase is still poorly understood . especially the departure from spherically symmetric agb circumstellar envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the formation of diverse , axisymmetric , nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are of great interest to astronomers .",
    "determining the main cause(s ) of the breaking of mass - loss symmetry is an important issue in understanding the late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "previous morphological studies of post - agb objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter umb00 ) revealed many asymmetrical nebulae around central stars , where jets and concentric arcs or rings were not unusual .",
    "further , the ground - based mid - ir ( 821 @xmath7 m ) observations done by @xcite showed two morphological classes of extended axisymmetric nebulae among post - agb objects : `` core / elliptical '' with unresolved cores and elliptical nebulae and `` toroidal '' with limb - brightened peaks that suggest equatorial density enhancements .",
    "optical observations revealed more interesting details on structures seen in post - agb nebulae .",
    "umb00 observed 27 ppn candidates and divided them into two classes : the star - obvious low - level elongated ( sole ) nebulae which show star - dominated emission with faint extended nebulosity and dust - prominent longitudinally extended ( duplex ) nebulae which are dust dominated with a faint or completely obscured central star .",
    "they also noticed that those two optical classes corresponded to the mid - ir ones , i.e. core / elliptical @xmath8 duplex and toroidal @xmath8 sole , and that the main difference between sole and duplex nebulae was the degree of the equatorial enhancement ( i.e. , duplexes tend to have a higher equator - to - pole density ratio than soles ) and could not be attributed only to the inclination - angle effects .",
    "they also suggested that sole nebulae were optically thinner than duplex nebulae and that sole ppns would have evolved from low - mass progenitors and duplex from high - mass progenitors .",
    "later model calculations @xcite confirmed the physical differences between those two classes of objects .",
    "other high - resolution near - infrared @xmath3 observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also supported optical results .",
    "follow - up studies by e.g. , @xcite were conducted to further investigate the asymmetry of observed objects .",
    "they also found that differences in observed morphologies are caused ( mainly ) by optical depth and ( to a lesser extent ) by inclination of the objects .",
    "all those observations strengthen the hypothesis of an equatorial mass loss enhancement at the end of the agb ( superwind ) phase @xcite and that morphological shaping of nebulae occurs before the post - agb phase . moreover , the resulting diverse shapes observed in proto - planetary as well as pns may be caused by some properties of the central stars such as chemical composition , mass and/or metallicity .    in order to find further support to those results we have executed an @xmath3 snapshot survey of post - agb objects by increasing the range of masses and chemical composition ( c / o ratio ) and by enlarging the sample of studied objects . the goal of the project is to connect the observed diversity of nebular shapes with physical and chemical properties of the central stars",
    "in this paper we present the results for post - agb objects observed recently with @xmath3 .",
    "observation and data reduction are summarized in @xmath92 .",
    "the results and differences between selected groups of objects are shown in @xmath93 .",
    "in @xmath94 we discuss obtained results with references to physical and chemical properties of stars .",

    "we needed only two axis of extension . in case of duplex sources , where the central star was not visible and the lobes were clearly separated , we measured the size of each lobe separately and , in addition , the extension of the whole object .",

    "we measured also surface intensity of the nebulae at the edge and compared it to the star ( or peak if the central star was not visible , as in duplex sources ) surface intensity and got star - to - nebula surface intensity ratios ( @xmath39 ) . for objects without nebulae only the peak intensity was measured .",

    "we detected nebulosities in 15 out of 33 sources and classified them as sole and duplex following umb00 .",
    "soles have an optically thin ( continuous ) envelope and the star is therefore very bright at optical and near - infrared wavelengths in comparison to the nebula ( in terms of @xmath39 we consider values of @xmath42 ) . the surface brightness peaks at the central star .",
    "because of multiaxis lobes , with different shapes and surface brightness , umb00 divided those objects in subgroups of simple ellipse , multiple ellipses , an ellipse with embedded bipolar structure and an ellipse with concentric shells . these structures are also present in our objects .",
    "in addition we observe snail - like structures .",
    "the psf effects are apparent in the images : the faint nebular structures are often buried under the psf of the bright central star .",
    "duplexes have an optically thick torus that completely or partially obscures the central star .",
    "@xmath39 values are much below 1000 and the peak of the surface brightness is far away from the center of the object .",
    "the nebula is bipolar and the ( multiple ) lobes are seen through scattered light .",
    "the psf diffraction feature is usually not seen in the images of duplex objects .",
    "these observational characteristics of the nebulae are consistent with the present understanding of the structure of these shells , in which sole and duplex nebulae respectively represent the low and high ends of the degree of equatorial enhancement for an intrinsically axisymmetric circumstellar shell . in other words , there is not much of a difference between sole and duplex nebulae as far as the shell structure goes , but the difference is the optical depth along the equator due to the difference in the equator - to - pole density ratio resulting from the different degree of equatorial density enhancement .",
    "this is what makes duplex nebulae appear bipolar with a well - defined dust lane , while making sole nebulae appear elliptical without a clear dust lane .",
    "because of this , their shell morphology tends to become less definitive when the optical depth along the equator is close to unity ( and/or the inclination angle of the shell is far from edge - on ) .",

    "it may be a case of an intermediate optical depth object with a massive circumstellar envelope that makes its dust peak higher than the stellar component .",

    "this finding possibly indicates that duplexes tend to be optically thicker than soles , suggesting the more massive nature of duplexes with respect to soles .",
    "while it is an intriguing trend , it is nevertheless based on small number statistics ( only 3 sole : iras 11385 - 5517 , iras 12175 - 5338 and iras 18095 + 2704 and 4 duplex : iras 08005 - 2356 , iras 10197 - 5750 , iras 17150 - 3224 and iras 23541 + 7031 objects ) .",
    "thus , more observations are needed to verify this .",
    "most of the stellar sources in our sample is oxygen - rich ( 15 o - rich and 5 c - rich ) and we see no correlation between their chemical composition and morphology and/or masses .",
    "thus it can not be said that chemistry of the central star is a key leading to differences between groups of post - agb objects .",
    "umb00 found almost equal number of sole and duplex objects , 11 and 9 respectively ( the 10th duplex source in their sample , iras 09452 + 1330 , is an agb star ) , while in our sample there are 9 sole and only 4 duplex post - agbs .",
    "the reason for this are selection criteria .",
    "the umb00 sample focused mostly on sources for which evidence for spatial extension existed .",
    "our objects were selected to complement the existing images of ppns and to cover more diverse properties of stars .",
    "most of them were already studied previously and hence we know their magnitudes , temperatures and chemistry . and",
    "usually they are quite bright , there are not many faint objects in our sample .",
    "this selection was also caused by requirements of snapshot survey preferring brighter stars with shorter observation time .",
    "all this provided to the lack of duplex objects , which are usually very faint ( @xmath8315.4 in our sample ) .",
    "we analyzed hst images of 31 post - agb objects .",
    "we increased the number of observed ppns and covered a wider variety of ppns . following previous results of umb00 we selected sole and duplex sources based on their morphology .",
    "our results are consistent with umb00 , and therefore , strengthen the validity of the general ppn structure suggested by umb00 , in which an intrinsically axisymmetric shell assumes a different morphology mainly due to the varying degree of the equatorial density enhancement which determines the presence of the dust lane in duplexes and the absence of it in soles .",
    "we selected a separate group of stellar post - agb objects without visible nebulosities .",
    "we searched for connections between morphology of the nebulosities and the chemical and physical properties of their central stars and did not find any obvious connection .",
    "we confirmed results of umb00 that sole objects with thin envelopes are bluer then dusty duplex sources .",
    "we also suggested that some of the stellar sources may be objects with the nebulosity around central star , but seen pole - on and/or too faint and distant to be resolved .",
    "we also found the differences in galactic distribution of different groups with the soles lying farther from the galactic plane than duplexes , which could suggest that duplex objects may have more massive progenitors .",
    "however , we were not able to confirm this suggestion directly because the masses of duplexes and some soles are not known .",

    "<S> the results from a @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) snapshot survey of post - agb objects are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the survey is to complement existing @xmath3 images of ppn and to connect various types of nebulosities with physical and chemical properties of their central stars . </S>",
    "<S> nebulosities are detected in 15 of 33 sources . </S>",
    "<S> images and photometric and geometric measurements are presented . for sources with nebulosities </S>",
    "<S> we see a morphological bifurcation into two groups , duplex and sole , as previous studies have found . </S>",
    "<S> we find further support to the previous results suggesting that this dichotomy is caused by a difference in optical thickness of the dust shell . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 18 sources are classified as stellar post - agb objects , because our observations indicate a lack of nebulosity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that some stellar sources may in fact be duplex or sole based on their infrared colors . </S>",
    "<S> the cause of the differences among the groups are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some evidence suggesting that high progenitor - mass agb stars tend to become duplex post - agb objects . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate progenitor - mass agb stars tend to be sole post - agb objects . </S>",
    "<S> most of the stellar sources probably have low mass progenitors and do not seem to develop nebulosities during the post - agb phase and therefore do not become planetary nebulae . </S>"
