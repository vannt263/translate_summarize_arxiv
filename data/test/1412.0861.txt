    "recently a progress has been brought about to understand the confinement mechanism in qcd - like theories by compactifying the theories in one spatial dimension with the period @xmath5 . because of the asymptotic freedom , the small @xmath5 theory is in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath6 ) in qcd(adj . ) on @xmath7 .",

    "a molecule of fractional instantons and anti - instantons are generally called bions . for compactified space with small @xmath5 ,",
    "the perturbative analysis is reliable and shows that the wilson holonomy stabilizes the @xmath2 twisted boundary condition . in this case",
    ", one can demonstrate the condensation of classical field configurations composed of fractional instantons and anti - instantons with magnetic charge , which are called magnetic bions .",
    "condensation of magnetic bions implies the confinement in the compactified theory .",
    "it is anticipated that this phenomenon continues to hold for large @xmath5 , suggesting the confinement even for uncompactified theory .",
    "it has also been pointed out that neutral bions play an important role in explaining the resurgence phenomenon @xcite .",
    "neutral bions are composite of fractional instantons and anti - instantons with vanishing topological charge ( instanton number ) and zero magnetic charge .",
    "although perturbation series in field theories are divergent , the borel transformation is useful to obtain the re - summation of such divergent series .",
    "the borel transform often exhibits singularities on the positive real axis producing an imaginary ambiguities in the borel - resummed results .",
    "it has been found that these ambiguities in quantum mechanics are cancelled by contributions from molecule of instanton and anti - instantons @xcite .",
    "however , asymptotically free field theories like qcd and the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma models exhibits similar but more serious singularities near the origin , which are called infrared renormalons @xcite .",
    "recently it has been found that the nonperturbative contributions around the neutral saddle points also have imaginary ambiguities .",
    "these imaginary ambiguities of bion amplitudes are found to cancel @xcite precisely the imaginary ambiguities associated with the infrared renormalons , resulting in a more rigorous foundation of field theory .",
    "this phenomenon is called the resurgence .",
    "it is expected that full semi - classical expansion including perturbative and non - perturbative sectors , which is called resurgent expansion @xcite , leads to unambiguous and self - consistent definition of field theories in the spirit of quantum mechanical examples @xcite .",

    "models in two spacetime dimensions are more tractable compared to gauge theories in four dimensions , but have many features which are common to gauge theories in four dimensions . among them , the @xmath0 model in two spacetime dimensions has been studied as a toy model @xcite of the yang - mills theory in four spacetime dimensions , because of their interesting features such as the dynamical mass gap , the asymptotic freedom and the existence of instantons as bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) solutions @xcite .",

    "let us give a brief review of resurgence and the importance of bion contributions .",
    "it has been known that the number of feynman diagrams in quantum field theory grows factorially .",
    "this factorially divergent perturbation series of quantum field theory is usually discussed by means of the borel transform .",
    "the borel transform method is applicable to the following class of divergent series ( called gevrey-1 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 are constants .",
    "the borel transform @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 and the borel resummation @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 one can easily see that the borel resummation @xmath45 reproduces the original sum @xmath47 correctly whenever one can exchange the integral and the sum . otherwise , we need to define the sum in terms of the borel resummation .    as a simplified toy model ,",
    "let us consider a factorially divergent series of the following one with alternating signs @xmath48 then the borel transform becomes an analytic function without singularities on the positive real axis @xmath49 therefore the borel resummation is well - defined as an integral along the positive real axis @xmath50 this alternating factorially divergent series is a typical example of borel summable divergent series .",
    "on the other hand , if perturbation series is not alternating , the factorially divergent series gives the borel transform with singularities on positive real axis and the borel resummation has imaginary ambiguities .",
    "for instance , suppose that the perturbation series @xmath51 gives non - alternating factorially divergent series like @xmath52 the borel transform has a singularity on positive real axis @xmath53 @xmath54 therefore the borel resummation has imaginary ambiguities depending on the choice of integration contours to avoid the singularity ( equivalently the analytic continuation from negative real axis ) @xmath55 this ambiguous imaginary part has to be cancelled by contributions from other saddle points in the path - integral . in quantum mechanics or scalar field theories ,",
    "the position of the singularity in the borel plane has been found to correspond to molecules of instanton and anti - instanton @xcite .",
    "however , the asymptotically free theories like qcd and the @xmath0 model give additional singularities due to ir renormalons which are much closer to the origin and hence give much larger contributions .",
    "recent study @xcite showed that the bion amplitudes give the nonperturbative contribution needed to cancel the imaginary ambiguity due to the ir renormalons .",
    "when one space direction is compactified to @xmath56 with the circumference @xmath5 , there is a possibility to impose non - periodic boundary condition .",
    "moreover , asymptotic free theory becomes weakly coupled , and the stable configurations of wilson holonomies of @xmath57 subgroup of @xmath58 can be analyzed perturbatively @xcite .",

    "the fractional instanton is located at @xmath66 .",
    "a neutral bion is a molecule of fractional instantons and anti - instatons and is unstable under the annihilation process .",
    "then we anticipate that generic neutral bion configuration is not a solution of field equations .",
    "therefore we wish to construct a field configuration that reduces to a solution at least for far - separated fractional instantons and anti - instantons asymptotically .    from the bps solution in eq.([eq : fractional_instanton ] ) and their complex conjugates , we are naturally led to consider the following ansatz for the @xmath67 model satisfying the @xmath2 twisted boundary condition in eq .",

    "now we are in a position to sketch briefly how our results fit into the resurgence phenomenon .    according to the study , the imaginary ambiguity arising in non - borel - summable perturbative series",

    ". the imaginary ambiguity has the same magnitude with an opposite sign as the leading - order ambiguity ( @xmath125 ) arising from the non - borel - summable series expanded around the perturbative vacuum .",
    "the ambiguities at higher orders ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 , ... ) are cancelled by amplitudes of bion molecules ( 2-bion , 3-bion , ... ) , and the full trans - series expansion around the perturbative and non - perturbative vacua results in unambiguous definition of field theories .",

    "<S> classical configurations in the @xmath0 model on @xmath1 is studied with twisted boundary conditions . starting from fractional instantons with the @xmath2 twisted boundary conditions , we review briefly the relevance of our study to resurgence phenomenon in field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we consider primarily configurations composed of multiple fractional instantons , called  neutral bions \" , which are identified as  perturbative infrared renormalons \" . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an explicit ansatz corresponding to topologically trivial configurations containing one fractional instanton ( @xmath3 ) and one fractional anti - instanton ( @xmath4 ) , which is guaranteed to become a solution of field equations asymptotically for large separations . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive interactions between the instanton constituents from small to large separations are found to be consistent with the standard separated - instanton calculus . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the ansatz enables us to study bions and the related physics for a wide range of separations . </S>",
    "<S> this talk is mainly based on our recent work published in jhep * 1406 * , 164 ( 2014 ) [ arxiv:1404.7225 [ hep - th ] ] . </S>"
