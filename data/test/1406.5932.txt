    "the observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in 1995 was the culmination of a series of experiments carried out with atomic neutral gases @xcite in which macroscopic samples of matter were cool down until quantum degeneracy was reached .",
    "as it is well known , the method of evaporative cooling was the essential technique to reach temperatures below the @xmath0k degrees , necessary for the realization of bec .",
    "this technique works in several stages by lowering the temperature at each step as highly energetic particles are removed from the system .",
    "condensation in macroscopic samples was finally attained at 150 nk at a density of 2.5 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 for @xmath4rb atoms @xcite , and below @xmath5 @xmath0k at a density of 1 @xmath1 @xmath6 @xmath3 for @xmath7na atoms @xcite .    while there is well established knowledge of ground state and non - equilibrium properties of trapped bec , mostly within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field approach @xcite , those predictions are restricted to the very low temperature regime where the transition to bec has already occurred .",
    "thus , there is interest in describing the dynamics or kinetics of the formation of the condensate , taking into account the essential mechanism of atomic collisions that end up equilibrating the system once , say , a evaporative cooling step has been performed .    the incorporation of collisional effect has been the main goal in all the formulated kinetic theories so far that describe the dynamics during the formation of a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the present work is within such a dynamical description context and it is particularly concerned with the derivation , in the weak coupling limit and the markov approximations , of irreversible master equations for the one body reduced density matrix operator . to be precise ,",
    "our aim is the description of the time evolution of the occupation numbers as the bec transition takes place .    similarly to earlier kinetic formulations , @xcite we work in the born and markov approximations to straightforwardly derive irreversible master equations that describe the dynamics during the formation of a condensate .",
    "as we explain below , we have added the important contribution of bogoliubov to take into account the role played by the condensate below the transition temperature .",
    "we derive kinetic equations appropriate for temperatures @xmath8 and for @xmath9 .",
    "the equations describing the relaxation towards equilibrium for @xmath10 allow us to demonstrate that the ideal bose - einstein distribution with negative chemical potential is the stationary solution for both the ground and excited states , and that the total number of particles as well as the total energy are conserved along the thermalization of each cooling step .",
    "however , since this equation is unable of describing the dynamics for the ground and excited states when the chemical potential becomes zero , that is , for the dynamics below @xmath11 , we derive a novel kinetic equation to properly describe the evolution in time of a weakly interacting bose gas for @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , we consider the fact that when the chemical potential becomes zero , the particles in the separate ground and excited states are not conserved .",
    "thus , we propose to replace the interaction term of the master equation , accounting for every single collision event , by an interaction potential in which the colliding particles arising from the ground state are treated within the bogoliubov approximation @xcite . technically speaking",
    ", we shall consider that the creation and annihilation operators involving the ground state @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be substituted by @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "such a practice is well justified by the fact that the number of of particles in the ground state , when the chemical potential is zero , becomes macroscopic , i.e. @xmath17 and thus the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the number - occupation states appear simply as @xmath15 .",
    "this procedure leads us to obtain a new kinetic equation for the particles in the excited states , exhibiting the correct limits .",
    "the equilibration after each cooling stage can thus be analyzed for all temperatures , above and below @xmath11 .",
    "for the numerical simulation of the kinetic equations we propose here a protocol of energetic cooling .",
    "this scheme consists of several cooling steps in which the temperature in the closed system is decreased while maintaining constant the number of particles .",
    "the temperature at each cooling step is lowered by transferring particles from higher energy levels and distributing them in levels with lower energy .",
    "interatomic collisions re - thermalize the gas to a lower temperature .",
    "in contrast with the evaporative cooling technique , this scheme prevents the system against decreasing the number of particles , yet , by reducing its energy , its density at the center of the trap increases and , thus , degeneracy can be reached .",
    "this protocol may represent an alternative route for the experimentalists to achieve the degeneration regime with a much larger number of atoms than usual .",
    "although it is not the purpose of this article , we suggest that the transferring to lower energy levels may be implemented by means of impulsive anti - stokes stimulated raman scattering @xcite with properly tailored ultrashort microwave pulses , similarly to techniques used with light in single - molecule wavepacket interferometry @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the derivation of the kinetic master equations describing the growth dynamics of the condensate for temperatures above and below the critical temperature defining the transition . in section",
    "iii we present numerical results that model the energetic cooling process as several stages are performed in a bosonic gas towards the formation of a condensate .",
    "finally , in section iv a summary of this work is given .",
    "as envisaged by einstein and stated in textbooks , there are two routes to achieve the condensation in a macroscopic system .",
    "one is by lowering the temperature and maintaining constant the density and the other is by increasing the density and keeping constant the temperature . the implementation of the first method requires to put the closed system in thermal contact with a reservoir at a lower temperature , wait for the system to reach thermal equilibrium and then repeat the scheme until the system reaches the transition temperature .",
    "the second route conceives an open system that increases its density being in contact with a reservoir at fixed temperature . as before",
    ", the system reaches an equilibrium state after a relaxation time , and again is placed in contact with a reservoir with larger chemical potential , as part of the sequence , until the transition is reached .",
    "it is important to note that both procedures ensure that the onset of condensation may be achieved in a reversible way . in practice none of these methods",
    "is performed in the laboratory .    in actual experiments , the observation of the bec transition requires to perform several cooling stages in a thermally isolated bose gas , in which a given equilibrium state is perturbed reducing its energy ( and the number of atoms in evaporative cooling ) and then , by a necessarily irreversible process , the system reaches a new equilibrium state with a lower temperature .",
    "this cooling is repeated until the system attains the critical temperature @xmath11 at which the transition to condensation occurs .",
    "our aim in this work is to describe , through quantum kinetic equations , the dynamical process that takes place during the thermalization at each cooling step . to accomplish this goal in this section",
    "we derive the kinetic equations that describe the relaxation process towards the stationary or equilibrium state in each cooling step .",
    "as we shall see , such a description requires to take into account that the cooling process must be divided in two parts , one for temperatures above the critical temperature @xmath11 at which the gas is in the normal phase , and the other for temperatures below @xmath11 when the bec transition to occurs .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the system consists of an ideal term @xmath18 that takes into account a isotropic harmonic confinement of the atoms , perturbed by a weakly interacting part @xmath19 that models the collisions among the particles . in a second quantization formalism these terms are :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 are the eigenenergies of a single particle confined in a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath22 in three dimensions , @xmath23 .",
    "since the energy of each single particle is characterized by three quantum numbers @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 their corresponding quantum state is denoted as a vector @xmath27 . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the operators that create and destroy particles in the state @xmath27 . in the expression for single particle energy @xmath21",
    "we have omitted the ground state energy @xmath30 , and as we recall below , this fixes the bec transition at @xmath31 . writing @xmath32 the degeneracy of each energy",
    "is given by @xmath33    regarding the interacting term , we shall assume that the ultracold gas is very diluted and consequently only @xmath34-wave binary collisions are relevant for the dynamics@xcite .",
    "this two - body interaction can be modeled by a contact potential whose interaction strength is proportional to the @xmath34-wave scattering length @xmath35 , assumed positive throughout ,    @xmath36    here and henceforth we identify the transition amplitude elements of equation ( [ interac ] ) as @xmath37 :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 .",
    "our starting point is the derivation , in the weak coupling limit and the markov approximation , of an irreversible master equation for the one body reduced density matrix operator@xcite .",
    "this is the quantum boltzmann equation for the operator @xmath40 that we define below .    as it is well known , the essence of a boltzmann equation is to consider that collisions among the particles are responsible for driving the system towards thermal equilibrium . once in equilibrium",
    "every thermodynamic property depends on single particle properties only .",
    "having in mind this idea , we write first the expectation value of any @xmath41-body single particle operator @xmath42 in the occupation number representation :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a one - body operator and @xmath45 is the density matrix of the whole system .",

    "we can identify the one body reduced density matrix operator @xmath48 :    @xmath49    where    @xmath50    we notice that by setting @xmath51 the one body reduced density matrix operator becomes the average occupation number in the state @xmath27 :    @xmath52    in order to derive the quantum kinetic master equation for @xmath48 , and in particular the equation for the average occupation number @xmath53 , we start by considering the schrdinger equation for the full density matrix of the system ,    @xmath54 . \\label{ecrho}\\ ] ]    after we substitute this equation into the resulting expression for the time derivative of equation ( [ gamma ] ) we obtain :    @xmath55 \\ } , \\label{qkme}\\ ] ]    where we have defined @xmath56 .",

    "such an approximation is directly related to the time scales involved in the collision integrals . in other words",
    ", we must compare the time scale during the relaxation process against the correlation time arising from the duration of a single collision .",

    ", we should emphasize that bec transition occurs in an ideal gas at at @xmath31 since the ground state energy @xmath83 has been neglected .    from a theoretical point of view , the occurrence of the transition to bose - einstein condensation in an ideal gas depends on both , dimensionality and the confining potential where the atoms move @xcite . the combined aspects of dimensionality and isotropy , mathematically expressed in the density of states , determine if bec can occur in an ideal gas @xcite .",
    "a 2d ideal uniform bose gas does not exhibit bec , by contrast to the 2d harmonically trapped one . regarding the 3d case , both the homogeneous and the harmonically trapped gas can have the transition .",

    "therefore , taking into account the underlying physics , an alternative kinetic equation for @xmath78 and @xmath9 must be derived to properly describe the time evolution and equilibration of the gas .",
    "the most important property of a dilute bose gas that has experienced the transition to the condensate state is that as a result of having chemical potential equal to zero , the ground state becomes macroscopically populated . as a consequence of this fact the intensive thermodynamic variables , that adjust to the extensive ones , are exclusively determined by the particles occupying the excited states only .",
    "perhaps a most relevant effect when a bose gas has chemical potential equal to zero , is that the number of particles @xmath41 is no longer a thermodynamic variable .",
    "although in the whole system the number of particles @xmath41 remains constant , the number of particles in the ground and excited states separately are not conserved since there is no energy cost in adding particles from the excited to the ground state and viceversa since @xmath85 . therefore , if one looks at the isolated fractions of particles in the ground and excited states , a continuous process of creation and annihilation of particles ( having @xmath85 ) takes place in each one of them .",
    "the physical process exposed above has not been considered previously , neither in the treatments involving kinetic descriptions , nor in the present one depicted in section [ sectiona ] .",
    "that is , for temperatures below @xmath11 the non conservation of particles in the separated fractions of ground and excited states has not been considered properly in the derivation of the kinetic equations describing the relaxation to the equilibrium state .",
    "the binary collisions are the key element where the non conservation of particles can be taken into account .",
    "since such collisions are the elementary mechanism to reach thermal equilibrium and they involve particles in the ground and excited states , we must have special care in each collision event .",
    "up to now , each pair of particles coming from either the ground state , or the excited states , transform after the collision into a pair of particles that again can occupy the ground state or the excited states , in such a way that there is no distinction between the fractions of particles in the ground and excited states respectively .",
    "however , if we consider the fact stated in the above paragraph regarding the non conservation of particles in the separate ground and excited states , and that the occupation number in the ground state becomes macroscopic @xmath17 , we can proceed in a different way treating separately the ground state and the excited states .",
    "in particular , we can explicitly assume that below the critical temperature , the fraction of the particles in the excited states participating in the collision process is not conserved .",
    "this procedure lead us to derive a new kinetic equation for the excited states . then , by considering the fact that the _ total _ number of particles is conserved we can obtain the number of particles in the ground state by subtracting the particles in the excited states from the total number of particles @xmath41 .    to model a process in which the number of particles in the excited states is not conserved , we first rewrite the interaction term given in equation ( [ interac ] ) including separately the ground and excited states :    @xmath86    where we have made explicit the fact that the ground state is not included in the sums . to take into account that the dynamics in the excited states ( when @xmath31 ) is dictated with no constrains under conservation of the number of particles in such states , we propose to replace the interaction term given in equation ( [ full - int ] ) by    @xmath87    in this expression we have replaced the creation and annihilation operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "this is the bogoliubov approximation @xcite .",
    "the aim behind such an assumption is to consider the macroscopic character of the particle population in the ground state @xmath16 for temperatures ranging below the critical temperature @xmath11 .",

    "to justify our suggestion let us consider one of terms of the interaction potential ( [ full - int ] ) ,    @xmath88    this term represents the anhilation of particles in the states @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and creation of particles in the states @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "if such a term is substituted by @xmath93 the number of particles in the excited states is explicitly not conserved , although of course , the missing particle belongs to the ground state . in other words , every interaction term in which the ground state participates is now omitted and the total number of particles in the system is conserved . after the expression ( [ int - ex ] ) for the interaction potential is substituted in the master kinetic equation ( [ maineq ] ) we obtain :    @xmath94 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2 \\text { } v_{{\\vec i } { \\vec \\eta } { \\vec l } { \\vec i } }   v_{{\\vec k } { \\vec l } { \\vec k } { \\vec \\eta } }   \\text { } \\delta _ { \\epsilon_{\\vec \\eta } , \\epsilon_{\\vec l } } n_{\\vec i } n_{\\vec k } \\left ( n_{\\vec l } - n_{\\vec \\eta } \\right ) \\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + n_{0}\\sum_{{\\vec k } { \\vec i } \\neq 0}v_{{\\vec \\eta}{\\vec k}{\\vec i } { \\vec 0 } } ^2\\ { \\text {   } 2\\delta_{\\epsilon_{\\vec \\eta}+\\epsilon_{\\vec i},\\epsilon_{\\vec k}}[n_{\\vec k}(1+n_{\\vec \\eta}+n_{\\vec i})-n_{{\\vec i}}n_{\\vec \\eta}]\\ } \\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\delta_{\\epsilon_{\\vec \\eta},\\epsilon_{\\vec k }   + \\epsilon_{\\vec i}}[n_{\\vec i } n_{\\vec k}-n_{\\vec \\eta}(1+n_{\\vec k}+n_{\\vec i})]+ \\nonumber \\\\   & & + 2n_{{\\vec 0}}^2\\sum_{\\vec{k}}\\delta_{\\epsilon_{\\vec \\eta},\\epsilon_{\\vec k } } v^2_{{\\vec \\eta}{\\vec k}{\\vec 0}{\\vec 0}}(n_{\\vec k}-n_{\\vec \\eta } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath95 being @xmath96 is the number of particles in the ground state .    by substituting @xmath97 - 1 } , \\label{bose - ex}\\ ] ]",

    "as we discuss below , the solution for @xmath139 becomes numerically unstable as @xmath166 . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinetic equations for @xmath99 become extremely good in the vicinity @xmath167 , notwithstanding the small number of particles .",

    "as expected , this solution becomes less confident as @xmath171 from below , and similarly to the equations for @xmath139 near absolute zero , the numerical description for @xmath168 becomes unstable as bec transition is approached .",
    "one expects that in the limit of very large number of particles , and large number of levels included in a numerical calculation , the limitations of both descriptions in the regions where are not supposed to be valid , should be more apparent .",
    "this is further discussed below .",
    "[ fig7a ] and [ fig7b ] show details of calculations near @xmath167 and @xmath139 , eq .",

    "( [ eccinergomu ] ) , respectively .",
    "the purpose of these figures is to exemplify the numerical instabilities of the corresponding descriptions .",
    "[ fig7a ] shows the number of particles in the condensate , with @xmath139 , with a very large number of particles , @xmath172 , which can be performed due to the very small value of the temperature .",
    "one sees , first , that the solution deviates from the that of the thermodynamic limit ( solid line ) , then it becomes unstable .",
    "the simpler explanation is that , at these temperatures @xmath0 must be zero , but the fitted bose - einstein distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ bed ] ) can not take @xmath99 for a divergence would occur . although not shown here , the solution for @xmath99 fits smoothly the solid curve all the way down to @xmath167 . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] shows the stationary total occupation number in the excited states for @xmath99 and @xmath9 .",
    "similarly to the previous case , as @xmath11 is approached , a numerical difficulty arises in the form of a double valued solution .",
    "again , this exhibits that this solution requires not only more particles but more equations for higher energy levels .",
    "it is satisfactory , nevertheless , to find that , apart from near the vicinity of @xmath11 , the solution for @xmath99 , which explicitly takes the bogoliubov approximation into account , fits extremely well the curves of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have studied the cooling process that leads a low - interacting bose gas confined in a harmonic potential to reach the bose - einstein transition . for this purpose",
    "we modeled the reduction of temperature in the gas through an energetic cooling protocol . in an analogous way to the evaporative cooling mechanism",
    ", the fundamental principle behind such a process , is that the temperature in a gas can be reduced in several stages by removing selectively the most energetic particles , and then allowing the system to thermalize to an equilibrium state with a lower temperature .",
    "the essential mechanism that leads the low interacting gas to reach the equilibrium state are the inter particle collisions .",
    "thus the path to equilibrium at each cooling step can be followed dynamically through a quantum kinetic boltzmann description .",
    "we derived the equations that describe the relaxation to the equilibrium in the gas taking into account that the cooling process must be divided in two parts , one for temperatures above the critical temperature @xmath11 at which the gas is in the normal phase , and the other for temperatures below @xmath11 when the transition to bose - einstein condensation takes place .    to derive the irreversible master equations for the one body reduced density matrix operator in both cases ( @xmath10 and @xmath12 )",
    ", we worked in the born and markov approximations that assume the perturbative character of the interaction term that represents the collisions among the particles , and that memory effects of the collision kernel are negligible , respectively . among the dynamics of any one - body reduced density matrix operator @xmath173",
    ", we specifically followed the evolution in time of the occupation number operator @xmath174 to determine the particle population , in a single quantum state @xmath175 , as a function of time during the thermalization process .",
    "first , based on the fact that bose - einstein condensation can occur in a harmonically trapped bose gas in two and three dimensions , we derived for @xmath10 the kinetic equation that describes the relaxation to a stationary state of a collection of particles out of equilibrium , eq .",
    "( [ eccin ] ) .",
    "we demonstrated that such equation satisfies that the total energy and the total number of particles are conserved , and that the ideal bose - einstein distribution with @xmath176 is the stationary solution of equation ( [ eccin ] ) for both the ground state , and the excited states .",
    "however , since equation ( [ eccin ] ) does not describe the dynamics for the ground and excited states when the chemical potential becomes zero or the temperature diminishes below @xmath11 , we derived a new kinetic equation , taking into account the underlying physics using the bogoliubov approximation @xcite , to properly describe the evolution in time of a low - interacting bose gas for @xmath12 .",
    "the quantum kinetic equation for @xmath12 was derived considering the physical significance of the fact that the chemical potential remains unchanged at the occurrence of the bose - einstein transition .",
    "in other words , we took into account that the thermodynamic state of the system is solely determined by the particles occupying the excited states . and",
    "therefore , considering the fact that the number of particles @xmath41 is no longer a thermodynamic variable although the total number of particles in the whole system remains constant . to derive a new kinetic equation considering this facts , we proposed to replace the interaction term that accounts for every single collision event , by an interaction potential in which the colliding particles arising from the ground state are treated within the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "this means that the creation and annihilation operators involving the ground state @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be substituted by @xmath16 , being @xmath16 the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "such an assumption lead us to end up with an equation , eq .",
    "( [ eccin2 ] ) , that describes the dynamics below @xmath11 for which the chemical potential no longer varies , but is equal to zero .",
    "we have presented a numerical simulation employing equations ( [ eccin ] ) and ( [ eccin2 ] ) to model the process of the bose - einstein condensation . to achieve this purpose we implemented an energetic cooling protocol .",

    "to lower the temperature we considered a given number of particles distributed according to the bose - einstein statistics , then , we removed the particles occupying the highest excited states and distribute them uniformly in the remaining lowest states . the system was allowed to evolve via the kinetic equations towards the equilibrium state .",
