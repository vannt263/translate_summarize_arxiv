    "energy harvesting facilitates the battery charging to prolong the lifetime of wireless networks , especially under some extreme conditions , such as battle - field , underwater and body area networks @xcite .",
    "wherein , electromagnetic wave based wireless power transfer has received considerable research attentions from academic and industry due to two - fold reasons .",
    "first , it is a controllable power transfer mode .",
    "second , information and power can be simultaneously transferred in the form of electromagnetic wave @xcite @xcite .",
    "similar to information transmission , wireless power transfer may suffer from channel fading , resulting in low energy efficiency . in this end",
    ", energy beamforming is proposed by deploying multiple antennas at the power source @xcite @xcite .",
    "the impact of channel state information ( csi ) at the power source on the performance of wireless information and power transfer ( wipt ) is quantitatively analyzed in @xcite .",
    "recently , large scale multiple input multiple output ( ls - mimo ) techniques are also introduced to significantly improve the efficiency of wipt by exploiting the high spatial resolution @xcite . moreover , relaying technique is also proved as an effective way of improving the performance of wipt by shortening the transfer distance , since the distance has a great impact on both information and power transfer @xcite . a two - way relaying scheme",
    "is proposed in @xcite to offer a higher transmission rate with the harvested energy .",
    "in fact , through combing relaying schemes and multi - antenna techniques , especially the ls - mimo techniques , the performance of wipt can be improved significantly , even in the case of long - distance transfer . however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no work studying the problem of the ls - mimo relaying techniques for wipt .",
    "meanwhile , information transfer may encounter interception from the eavesdropper due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels . in recent years , as a supplementary of encryption techniques , physical layer security is used to realize secure communications , by exploiting wireless channel characteristics , i.e. , fading and noise .",
    "the performance of physical layer security is determined by the performance difference between the legitimate and eavesdropper channels @xcite .",
    "thus , the ls - mimo relaying technique is also an effective way of improving the secrecy performance @xcite . for secure wipt , long - distance transfer and short - distance interception are two challenging issues @xcite @xcite . to solve them",
    ", we introduce the amplify - and - forward ( af ) ls - mimo relaying technique into secure wipt .",
    "the contributions of this paper are two - fold :    1 .",
    "we derive an explicit expression of the secrecy outage capacity for such a secure wipt system in terms of transmit power , csi accuracy and transfer distance .",
    "we propose a power splitting scheme at the relay , so as to maximize the secrecy outage capacity .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give an overview of the secure wipt system based on the ls - mimo af relaying scheme in section ii , and then derive the secrecy outage capacity under imperfect csi in section iii . in section iv , we present some simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme .",
    "finally , we conclude the whole paper in section v.",
    "we consider a time division duplex ( tdd ) ls - mimo af relaying system , where a single antenna source communicates with a single antenna destination aided by a multi - antenna relay , while a single antenna passive eavesdropper intends to intercept the message , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "note that the number of antenna at the relay @xmath0 is quite large for such an ls - mimo relaying system , i.e. , @xmath1 or greater .",
    "the relay only has limited energy to maintain the active state , so it needs to harvest enough energy from the source for information transmission . considering the limited storage , the relay should be charged from the source slot by slot .",
    "the whole system is operated in slotted time of length @xmath2 , and the relay works in the half - duplex mode .",
    "then , the information transmission from the source to the destination via the aid of the relay requires two time slots .",
    "specifically , in the first time slot , the source sends the signal , and the relay splits the received signal into two streams , one for energy harvesting and the other for information processing . during the second time slot",
    ", the relay forwards the post - processing signal to the destination with the harvested energy .",
    "note that the direct link from the source to the destination is unavailable due to a long distance .",
    "we assume that the eavesdropper is far away from the source and is close to the relay , since it thought the signal comes from the relay . note that it is a common assumption in related literature @xcite @xcite , since it is difficult for the eavesdropper to overhear the signals from the source and the relay simultaneously .",
    "then , the eavesdropper only monitors the transmission from the relay to the destination .",
    "we use @xmath3 to denote the channel from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 representing the source , the relay , the destination and the eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the distance - dependent path loss and @xmath10 is the small scale fading . in this paper , we model @xmath10 as gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "@xmath9 remains constant during a relatively long period and @xmath10 fades independently slot by slot .",
    "thus , the received signal at the relay in the first time slot can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalized gaussian distributed transmit signal , @xmath13 is the transmit power at the source , and @xmath14 is the additive gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance at the relay .",
    "as mentioned above , the relay splits the received signal @xmath15 into energy harvesting stream with proportional factor @xmath16 and signal processing stream with @xmath17 .",
    "then , according to the law of energy conservation , the harvesting energy at the relay is given by @xmath18 where the constant parameter @xmath19 , scaling from 0 to 1 , is the efficiency ratio at the relay for converting the harvested energy to the electrical energy to be stored @xcite @xcite . with the harvested energy , the relay forwards the post - processing signal @xmath20 to the destination .",
    "then the received signals at the destination and the eavesdropper are given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the additive gaussian white noises with zero mean and unit variance at the destination and the eavesdropper .",
    "@xmath25 is the post - processing signal with @xmath26 being a transform matrix .",
    "we assume the relay has full csi @xmath27 by channel estimation , and gets partial csi @xmath28 via channel reciprocity in tdd systems . due to duplex delay between uplink and downlink",
    ", there is a certain degree of mismatch between the estimated csi @xmath29 and the real csi @xmath28 , whose relation can be expressed as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the error noise vector with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero mean and unit variance complex gaussian entries .",
    "@xmath32 , scaling from 0 to 1 , is the correlation coefficient between @xmath29 and @xmath28 . a larger @xmath32 means better csi accuracy . if @xmath33 , the relay has full csi @xmath28 .",
    "additionally , due to the hidden property of the eavesdropper , the csi @xmath34 is unavailable .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 is designed only based on @xmath27 and @xmath29 , but is independent of @xmath34 . considering the better performance of maximum ratio combination ( mrc ) and maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) in ls - mimo systems , we design @xmath26 by combining mrc and mrt .",
    "mathematically , the transform matrix is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the power constraint factor .",
    "to fulfill the energy constraint at the relay , @xmath36 can be computed as @xmath37    based on the af relaying scheme , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the destination is given by ( [ eqn9 ] ) at the top of the next page ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the received snr at the eavesdropper is given by ( [ eqn10 ] ) at the top of this page ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "letting @xmath45 and @xmath46 be the legitimate channel and the eavesdropper channel capacities , then the secrecy rate is given by @xmath47^+$ ] , where @xmath48^+=\\max(x,0)$ ] @xcite .",
    "since there is no knowledge of the eavesdropper channel at the source and relay , it is impossible to maintain a steady secrecy rate over all realizations of fading channels . in this context",
    ", we take the secrecy outage capacity @xmath49 as the performance metric , which is defined as the maximum available rate while the outage probability that the transmission rate surpasses the secrecy rate is equal to a given value @xmath50 , namely @xmath51",
    "in this section , we first analyze the secrecy outage capacity of such an ls - mimo af relaying system with energy harvesting , and then derive an optimal power splitting scheme to determine the proportional factor @xmath16 .      according to ( [ eqn11 ] ) , the secrecy outage capacity is jointly determined by the legitimate and eavesdropper channel capacities , so we first analyze the legitimate channel capacity . based on the received snr at the destination in ( [ eqn9 ] )",
    ", we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 1 _ : the legitimate channel capacity in an ls - mimo af relaying system under imperfect csi can be approximated as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a half of the spectral bandwidth .",
    "please refer to appendix i.    it is found that the legitimate channel capacity is a constant due to channel hardening in such an ls - mimo af relaying system .",
    "then , according to the definition of the secrecy outage capacity , we have a theorem as below :    _ theorem 2 _ : given an outage probability bound by @xmath50 , the secrecy outage capacity for an ls - mimo af relaying scheme is @xmath54 .",
    "please refer to appendix ii .    while theorem 2 is useful to study the secure wireless information and power transfer system s secrecy outage capacity , the expression is in general too complex to gain insight .",
    "motivated by this , we carry out asymptotic analysis on the secrecy outage capacity at high transmit power regime , and derive the following theorem :    _ theorem 3 _ : at high transmit power regime , the secrecy outage capacity in this case is independent of transmit power @xmath13 .",
    "there exists a performance upper bound on the secrecy outage capacity",
    ".    please refer to appendix iii .",
    "_ remarks _ : the secrecy outage capacity will be saturated once the transmit power surpasses a threshold .",
    "this is because the af relaying system is noise limited due to noise amplification at the relay in this case .",
    "thus , it makes sense to find the minimum power that achieves the maximum secrecy outage capacity .",
    "according to theorem 2 , for a given transmit power , the secrecy outage capacity is a function of power splitting ratio @xmath16 .",
    "intuitively , a large @xmath16 leads to a high transmit power at the relay , but the received signal power decreases .",
    "moreover , from the view of wireless security , a high transmit power at the relay may also increases the interception probability .",
    "thus , it is necessary to optimize the power splitting ratio , so as to maximize the secrecy outage capacity .",
    "since @xmath55 is an increasing function , in order to maximize the secrecy outage capacity , it is equivalent to maximizing the term @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the optimal power splitting can be described as the following optimization problem : @xmath57    the objective function is not concave , so it is difficult to provide a closed - form expression for the optimal @xmath16 . however , because ( [ eqn13 ] ) is a one - dimensional function of @xmath16 , it is possible to get the optimal @xmath16 by numerical searching .",
    "specifically , by scaling @xmath16 from 0 to 1 with a fixed step , the optimal @xmath16 related to the maximum objective function is obtained .",
    "to examine the accuracy and effectiveness of the derived theoretical results for secure wipt in an ls - mimo af relaying system , we present several simulation results in the following scenarios : we set @xmath1 , @xmath58khz , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 without extra explanation .",
    "the relay is in the middle of a line between the source and the destination .",
    "we normalize the path loss as @xmath62 , and use @xmath63 to denote the relative interception path loss . specifically , if @xmath64 , the interception distance is shorter than the legitimate propagation distance , and then the interception becomes strong .",
    "in addition , we use snr@xmath65 to represent the transmit signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in db at the source .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    first , we validate the accuracy of the theoretical results with snr=10db . as shown in fig.[fig3 ] , the theoretical results coincide with the simulations nicely in the whole @xmath63 region under different requirements of outage probability .",
    "given a outage probability bound by @xmath50 , as @xmath63 increases , the secrecy outage capacity decreases gradually .",
    "this is because the interception capacity of the eavesdropper enhances due to the shorter interception distance . on the other hand , for a given @xmath63 ,",
    "the secrecy outage capacity improves with the increase of @xmath50 , since the secrecy outage capacity is an increasing function of outage probability .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    second , we investigate the impact of power transfer distance on the secrecy outage capacity with @xmath66 , @xmath67 and snr=0db for secure swip .",
    "note that optimal power splitting is adopted to improve the secrecy outage capacity . as seen in fig.[fig2 ] , even at a small @xmath68 , namely long transfer distance , there is a large secrecy outage capacity . as a simple example , at @xmath69 , the proposed scheme with @xmath70 can achieve @xmath71 kb / s . as @xmath72 increases",
    ", the secrecy outage capacity significantly improves .",
    "thus , the proposed scheme can solve the challenging problem of long - distance transfer for secure wipt .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    then , we examine the effect of interception distance on the secrecy outage capacity with @xmath67 and snr=0db for secure swip . similarly , optimal power splitting is adopted to improve the secrecy outage capacity . as seen in fig.[fig6 ] , even at a large @xmath63 , namely short interception distance , there is a large secrecy outage capacity . as a simple example , at @xmath73 , the proposed scheme with @xmath70 can achieve @xmath74 kb / s .",
    "as @xmath72 increases , the secrecy outage capacity significantly improves .",
    "thus , the proposed scheme can solve the challenging problem of short - distance interception for secure wipt .",
    "next , we show the impact of snr on the secrecy outage capacity with @xmath66 . as seen in fig.[fig4 ] , the secrecy outage capacity is an increasing function of snr .",
    "however , as snr increases , the secrecy outage capacity will be saturated .",
    "this is because the af relaying system is noise limited due to noise amplification , which confirmed the claim in theorem 3 .",
    "thus , it makes sense to find the optimal snr to maximize the secrecy outage capacity in ls - mimo relaying systems with the minimum transmit power .",
    "finally , we check the effectiveness of the proposed optimal power splitting scheme with respect to a fixed scheme .",
    "specifically , the fixed scheme sets @xmath16 as 0.1 fixedly regardless of channel condition and transmit power . as seen in fig.[fig5 ]",
    ", the proposed scheme performs better obviously .",
    "especially , as snr increases , the performance gain becomes larger .",
    "note that the proposed scheme also will suffer from performance saturation .",
    "however , the performance bound can be lifted by adding antennas at the relay , which is a main advantage of the ls - mimo relaying scheme for secure wipt .",
    "a major contribution of this paper is the introduction of the ls - mimo relaying technique into secure wireless information and power transfer to significantly enhance wireless security and improve transmission rate .",
    "this paper derives a closed - form expression of the secrecy outage capacity in terms of transmit snr , power splitting ratio , antenna number and interception distance .",
    "furthermore , through maximizing the secrecy outage capacity , we present a power splitting scheme , which has a huge performance gain with respect to the fixed scheme .",
    "based on the snr @xmath75 at the destination , the legitimated channel capacity can be expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath53 is a half of the spectral bandwidth , since a complete transmission requires two time slots .",
    "@xmath77 denotes the real part of @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath28 is replaced by @xmath79 in ( [ app1 ] ) .",
    "( [ app2 ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath80 scales with the order @xmath81 as @xmath82 while @xmath83 scales as the order @xmath84 , which can be negligible .",
    "( [ app3 ] ) holds true because of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , namely channel hardening @xcite .",
    "therefore , we get the theorem 1 .",
    "according to ( [ eqn11 ] ) , for a given @xmath50 , we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath89 . in order to derive the secrecy outage capacity ,",
    "the key is to get the cdf of @xmath89 . examining ( [ eqn10 ] ) , due to channel hardening , we have @xmath90 since @xmath91 is an isotropic unit vector and independent of @xmath34 , @xmath92 is @xmath93 distributed with 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "let @xmath94 , we can derive the cdf of @xmath89 as @xmath95 if @xmath96 , then we have @xmath97 since @xmath98 is impossible when @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 equivalently , we have @xmath101 hence , we get the theorem 2 .",
    "for the secrecy outage capacity in ( [ app9 ] ) , if the transmit power @xmath13 is sufficiently large , it can be approximated as @xmath102 where ( [ app10 ] ) holds true since the constant  1 \" is negligible when @xmath13 is large enough .",
    "it is found that the secrecy outage capacity in this case is independent of transmit power @xmath13 .",
