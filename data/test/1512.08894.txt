    "the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) in the presence of an external magnetic field has been explored extensively in recent years@xcite .",
    "this is of great phenomenological relevance for non - central heavy ion collisions and dense neutron stars as well as cosmological evolutions in its early stage . in particular , the peculiar response of the spontaneously breaking of chiral symmetry to a strong magnetic field",
    "is among the central issues and posseses a theoretical challenge .",
    "the profound effect of the magnetic field on chiral symmetry breaking had been pointed out in quantum electrodynamics(qed ) very early@xcite .",
    "it was found that magnetic fields can enhance the chiral symmetry breaking due to an effective dimension reduction in the lowest landau level(lll ) in the charged fermionic sector .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ magnetic catalysis_. in qcd , this problem can be addressed reliably by the lattice monte - carlo simulation without sign problem@xcite . it has shown intriguingly and , however , unexpectedly that the chiral critical temperature decreases with an increasing magnetic field , which is in explicit conflict with magnetic catalysis and thus termed as _ inverse magnetic catalysis _ or _",
    "magnetic inhibition_. many attempts already exist in the literatures trying to explain this contradiction@xcite .    along with the dimension reduction in the fermionic sector , which accounts for the magnetic catalysis",
    ", the significance of magnetic fields manifests in another important aspect in a general way in systems with spontanously symmetry breaking .",
    "it enhances the fluctuations through the spatial anisotropy of the spectrum of bosonic modes in the system , although the bosons are still in @xmath0 dimension and do not directly suffer from the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem which forbids the spontaneously breaking of continuous symmetry in @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions@xcite .",
    "this claim follows by the observation that the ginzburg critical window of the chiral phase transition gets widened in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the role played by magnetic fields is thus twofold which competes with each other .",
    "a simple and straightforward model to investigate this competition is the bose - einstein condensation(bec ) of neutral bosons composed by two equally and oppositely charged fermions@xcite , which is a physical analog of chiral condensate in a magnetic field , yet analytically tractable .",
    "the corresponding non - relativistic case had been studied in @xcite , where we found that the critical temperature for the bec was dramatically affected by the magnetic field . in weak coupling domain ( where the coupling fails to support a two fermion bound state in the absence of a magnetic field ) ,",
    "dimension reduction dominates and we found the usual magnetic catalysis effect . in strong coupling domain ( where a two fermion bound state exists in the absence of a magnetic field ) , however , the fluctuations dominate and the situation gets reversed , we found the inverse magnetic catalysis , i.e. , the critical temperature of bec decreases as an increasing magnetic field .    in the present paper , we shall extend the above analysis to the relativistic fermions .",
    "technically , this amounts to replace the non - relativistic fermionic propagator by the dirac one in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the corresponding one loop diagram underlying the theory will be quadratically divergent . the leading divergence can be removed by the coupling renormalization , similar to the non - relativistic case , where the renormalized coupling is in terms of the scattering length , but the logarithmic subleading divergence remains and a uv cutoff has to be introduced by hand .",
    "consequently , the results will be explicitly cutoff dependent , like all relativistic field theories with 4-fermion interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the cutoff does not change the results qualitatively .",
    "we found that the low lying spectrum of the bound pairs is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4(@xmath5 ) is the momentum component parallel ( perpendicular ) to the magnetic field , @xmath6 is an anisotropicity factor and @xmath7 is the rest energy of a bound pair .",
    "this spectrum implies a nonrelativistic like condensation temperature @xmath8^{2/3}\\frac{\\pi}{\\bar\\mu}\\label{transitiontemperature}.\\ ] ] at sufficiently low density . unlike the nonrelativistic case where only the anisotropicity factor @xmath9 is magnetic field dependent",
    ", the `` mass '' @xmath10 here depends on the magnetic field as well . in the weak coupling domain ,",
    "the magnetic field dependence of both @xmath9 and @xmath10 support magnetic catalysis and @xmath11 increases with an increasing magnetic field as in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the situation in strong coupling domain , however , is very different from that in the nonrelativistic case , in which the inverse magnetic catalysis prevails regardless of the strength of the magnetic field . in the present case",
    ", the inverse magnetic catalysis only appears when magnetic field is low and the magnetic catalysis effect takes place again when magnetic field is sufficiently high because of opposite roles played by @xmath9 and @xmath10 there .",
    "consequently , @xmath11 decreases first and then increases with the magnetic field .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we lay out the general formulation and present the mean field approximation . the fluctuations beyond the mean field theory , which is necessary for bec ,",
    "is calculated under the gaussain approximation in section iii .",
    "the numerical solutions to the gap equation and the condensation temperature are presented in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the conclusions and outlooks .",
    "some calculation details and useful formulas are presented in the appendices a , b , c and d. throughout the paper , we will work in euclidean space with the four vector represented by @xmath12 with @xmath13 the matsubara frequency for bosons @xmath14 or for fermions @xmath15 with @xmath16 the temperature .",

    "bound pairs may appear at zero magnetic field in contrast to the case in weak coupling domain , in which the pairs can only support by magnetic catalysis .",
    "therefore , the curve in fig.1 starts from @xmath178 at @xmath162 while the curve in fig.2 from @xmath179 at @xmath162 . in both cases",
    ", the results display an explicit dependence on the uv cutoff , which is intrinsic in the ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional model with contact interaction .",
    "but the dependence does not change the results qualitatively .",
    "the reason for the cross between the solid and dashed curves at lower magnetic field can be explained as follows .",
    "one can show that @xmath180^{-1}.\\label{muoflambda}\\ ] ] with @xmath181 and @xmath182 the rhs of the gap equation ( [ regularizedgapeq ] ) .",
    "it had been proved in the appendix that @xmath183 and ( [ muoflambda ] ) thus changes sign at a critical value @xmath184 .",
    "one therefore expects a crossing of the two sets of solutions corresponding to different uv cutoffs at strong coupling domain with @xmath185 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "such crossing should be absent in weak coupling since @xmath186 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the dimensionless critical temperature ( [ dimltc ] ) is determined by that of the anosotropicity factor @xmath9 and the ratio @xmath187 , which are plotted in fig.3 to fig.8 .",
    "as we can see , the anisotropicity decreases ( increases ) with magnectic field in strong ( weak ) coupling domains while the ratio @xmath188 increases with magnetic field in both domains .",
    "consequently , the competetion between the two opposite field dependence of @xmath189 and @xmath188 in the strong coupling domain yields an inverse magnetic catalysis at lower magnetic field but magnetic catalysis at higher magnetic field . in the weak coupling domain , however , both factors increases with the magetic field and the usual magnetic catalysis emerges .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the bec of bound pairs composed by two equally and oppositely charged relativistic fermions in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this is inspired by the inverse magnetic catalysis effect found in lattice qcd and is a generalization of our non - relativistic work @xcite .",
    "the purpose is to explore the interplay between the pairing dynamics and the fluctuations of bound pairs in a magnetic field , the latter of which underlies the mermin - wigner - coleman theorem on the absence of a long range order in lower dimensions .",
    "a nambu - jona - lasinio(njl)-like pairing interaction is considered and the fluctuation is examined within the gaussian approximation , which is valid at a sufficiently low density . unlike the case without a magnetic field where a bound state emerges for the coupling strength above a certain threshold , the bound states occurs also in the weak coupling domain because of the @xmath190 nature of the fermionic spectrum within lll .",
    "the binding energy of a bound pair is found to increase with the magnetic field as a consequence of the magnetic catalysis .",
    "the dependence of the bec critical temperature on the magnetic field depends on the coupling strength . in weak coupling domain",
    ", we found the usual magnetic catalysis . in strong coupling domain , unlike the nonrelativitic case , the inverse magnetic catalysis appears only in small magnetic field region and magnetic catalysis takes place again when magnetic field becomes sufficiently large .",
    "the reason for this difference is the dependence of the mass of bound pairs on the magnetic field in relativistic case .",
    "the condensation temperature is thus determined by two factors , the anisotropy and the ratio between the mass of bound pairs at zero magnetic field and the one with magnetic field dependence , both depends on the magnetic field . in strong coupling domain ,",
    "the two factors have opposite field dependence and yield the inverse magnetic catalysis in small magnetic filed region but magnetic catalysis at large field . in weak coupling domain ,",
    "both factors increase with the magnetic field and magnetic catalysis prevails .",
    "this variation indicates that the enhanced fluctuations by the anisotropy in the kinetic terms of the bound pairs is less dominant as compared with the nonrelativistic case .",
    "although the system we have studied shares the same physics as the chiral condensate in qcd regarding general prperties of a long range order and its fluctuations and is analytically tractable .",
    "the qcd dynamics , however , are expected to be far more complicated and other mechanisms may also contribute the simulated magnetic field dependence of the condensation temperature .",
    "for example , the quark loop that is influenced by the magnetic field can impact on the running of qcd coupling . in recently works based on functional renormalization group studies@xcite , inverse magnetic catalysis at a low magnetic field and",
    "a delayed magnetic catalysis at a high field had been found . the magnetic field at the turning point ( minimum @xmath52 ) between decreasing and increasing @xmath52",
    "is expected to be of order of several @xmath191 .",
    "ads / qcd model suggests the same behavior and similar value of magnetic field at the turning point@xcite .",
    "it is shown by one lattice calculation@xcite , however , that even at an extremely strong field @xmath192 , inverse magnetic catalysis still prevails .",
    "the reconciliation is still lacking at the present stage .",
    "in addition to the theoretical values of our present study , the physics involved may also be applicable in cold dense quark matter , such as the color - flavor - locking superconducting phase and the planar phase in single flavor superconductivity@xcite .",
