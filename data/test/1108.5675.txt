    "the binary fraction is an essential component in the formation and evolution of dynamically active systems , like globular clusters ( gcs ) . in such dense environments , where stellar gravitational interactions are very frequent",
    ", binaries can exert a significant influence on both the dynamical evolution of the system and the properties of its stellar populations .",
    "being , on average , more massive than the other stars , binaries tend to sink into the highly crowded cluster centers , because of equipartition .",
    "the characteristic timescale of this process ( the relaxation time ) depends on the cluster structure and can be even longer than a hubble time in the outskirts . hence , in the outer regions of gcs we essentially expect to observe primordial binary systems , i.e. , binaries created as part of the star formation process and evolving undisturbed . in the cluster core , on the other hand , a variety of dynamical processes ( exchange interactions , three - body encounters , tidal captures , etc . )",
    "can take place , with competing effects on the binary population : binaries can be destroyed , created or just modified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with relative efficiencies that still are a matter of debate in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general",
    ", however , the gravitational encounters occurring in the core tend to make the binaries harder ( more tightly bound ) , thus providing a central energy source able to slow down the cluster core collapse @xcite . following the n - body simulations of @xcite",
    ", this energy source could also suppress the mass segregation process , with a detectable effect on the radial behavior of the mass function of main - sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "since the same effect could alternatively be due to a central intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* herefater b10 ) , if we can measure the fraction of binaries , then we can say whether or not we need an imbh to explain the low level of mass segregation that has been observed .",
    "hence , the empirical estimate of the binary fraction in a sample of gcs representative of different environments is a prime ingredient for dynamical models , which help us understand the internal cluster dynamics .",
    "the knowledge of the binary fraction is also crucial for understanding the properties of puzzling objects like blue stragglers , millisecond pulsars and cataclysmic variables , which are all thought to be the by - products of binary evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the bimodal radial distribution of blue stragglers observed in a number of gcs ( e.g. , ferraro et al . 1997 , 2004 ; * ? ? ? * ) suggests that a non - negligible fraction of these stars is generated by primordial binaries , which still orbit in isolation in the cluster outskirts and produce the observed rising branch of the distribution ( mapelli et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "the interpretation of the double blue straggler sequence recently discovered in the core of m30 also requires a significant fraction of primordial binaries @xcite .    despite its implications , however , the binary fraction in gcs still remains badly constrained , because of the challenging observational requirements .",
    "the main techniques commonly used for its estimate are : radial velocity variability surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , searches for eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the first two methods rely on the detection of individual binary systems in a given range of periods and mass ratios .",
    "hence , the nature of these methods leads to intrinsic observational biases and a low detection efficiency .",
    "the latter approach relies on the simple fact that , since the flux of unresolved binaries is equal to the sum of the fluxes of the two components , the binaries composed by ms companions are shifted towards brighter magnitudes with respect to the single - star ms .",
    "this technique has the advantage of being more efficient and detecting binary systems regardless of their orbital periods and inclinations .    for the present paper we used this latter technique to estimate the binary fraction in the core and the outskirts of m10 ( ngc 6254 ) .",
    "this is an `` ordinary '' , dynamically relaxed gc , with absolute visual magnitude @xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) , central mass density @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being in units of @xmath5pc@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and half - mass relaxation time @xmath7 gyr ( harris 1996 ; see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the deep and high - quality photometry that b10 obtained for both the centre and beyond the half - mass radius , allowed them to study the cluster mass function at different radial distances .",
    "the resulting mass - segregation profile is moderately flattened and can be explained by the presence of either an imbh of @xmath8 , or a population of binaries with an initial fraction of 3 - 5% ( b10 ) .",
    "hence , within the framework proposed by @xcite , any empirical constraint on the binary content in this system would allow us to assess the possible presence of a central imbh .",
    "in addition , it will provide precious clues and constraints that would be useful for a robust interpretation of the properties the blue - straggler - population in this cluster ( emanuele dalessandro et al .",
    "2011 in preparation ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the used data - sets are presented in section 2 .",
    "the method adopted to estimate the binary fraction is outlined in section 3 .",
    "the results and the discussion are presented in section 4 and 5 .",
    "the data - set used in the present work ( the same as in b10 ) consists of a sample of @xmath9 images acquired in the f606w ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath9 images in f814w filters obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; go-10775 , pi : sarajedini ) , complemented with @xmath11 and @xmath12 images in f606w and @xmath11 and @xmath12 images obtained with the field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ; go-6113 , pi : paresce ) on board the hubble space telescope .",
    "the acs data - set samples the cluster central regions , while the wfpc2 one covers an area located between one and two half - mass radii ( see figure [ map ] ) . the detailed description of the data reduction , photometric calibration and @xmath13 magnitudes have been calibrated to the vegamag system by following the prescription of @xcite and @xcite for the acs and the wfpc2 samples , respectively . ] and astrometric solution procedures is given in b10 and the sample used in the present analysis contains the same `` bona - fide '' stars selected on the basis of the quality of the point - spread - function fitting ( as measured by the daophotii sharpness parameter ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cmds of the two data - sets are shown in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath14 and @xmath15 are saturated in the acs and wfpc2 samples , respectively .",
    "b10 also performed a detailed photometric completeness study , based on artificial star experiments , where artificial stars were added to the original flt frames and the whole data reduction procedure was repeated . from the resulting catalogue , listing the input and output positions and magnitudes for more than 500,000 artificial stars , b10 estimated that the photometric completeness drops below 50% at @xmath16 in the innermost region of the cluster , and at @xmath17 for the wfpc2 data - set .",
    "in order to estimate the binary fraction of m10 , we followed the method extensively described in @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s07 ) .",
    "the basic idea is that the magnitude of a binary system corresponds to the luminosity of the primary ( more massive ) star , increased by the contribution of the companion of an amount that depends on the mass ratio of the two components ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "in fact , since the stars along the ms follow a mass - luminosity relation , the luminosity of a binary can be written in terms of the mass ratio of the two components . by definition , @xmath19 and for @xmath20 ( equal - mass binary ) the system appears @xmath21 magnitudes brighter than the single component , while the luminosity enhancement decreases for decreasing @xmath22 .",
    "the spanning of all the possible values of @xmath22 , at different magnitudes of the primary component , produces a broadening of the single - star ms , to its bright- and red - hand side . in principle",
    ", the ratio between the number of stars lying on the red side of the single - star ms and the total number of stars observed along the `` broadened ms '' provides the cluster binary fraction . in practice , depending on the photometric error of the data , a minimum value of the mass ratio ( @xmath23 ) exists below which it is impossible to observationally distinguish a binary system from a single ms star .",
    "moreover , it is necessary to take into account a number of effects , like stellar blends and the contamination by foreground / background field stars , which can add spurious sources in the cmd .    indeed",
    ", chance superpositions of two stars ( blends ) can produce a luminosity enhancement that mimics the magnitude shift characteristic of a genuine binary system . in order to correct for this effect we analyzed the distribution of the residuals between the input and the output magnitudes of the artificial star catalogue built by b10 for the completness study ( see previous section ) . from the asymmetry of the distribution ( which is skewed toward brighter output magnitudes because of the blending between artificial and real stars ) we estimated that the percentage of blended sources that would mimick binary systems with @xmath24 , varies from @xmath25 in the core , to less than @xmath26 in the external regions .",
    "b10 also estimated the galactic field contamination in the direction of m10 , finding that it is very low : even in the worst case ( the wfpc2 data - set ) , where the number of cluster sources is small , the field stars are just @xmath27 of the total sample .",
    "despite such a low value , for a proper measurement of the binary fraction we performed a detailed study of the field contamination as a function of the magnitude .",
    "from the galaxy model of @xcite we retrieved a catalogue covering an area of @xmath28 in the direction of m10 , and we randomly extracted two sub - samples of synthetic stars , scaled to the fields of view of the acs and wfpc2 data - sets .",
    "their magnitudes were converted from the johnson to the vegamag photometric system adopting the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "finally , by exploiting the artificial - star catalogue used for the completeness study ) and we assigned the shifts between its input and output magnitudes to the field star , in a effort to mimick and take into account the effects of completeness and blending . ]",
    "[ data ] ) , we obtained a catalogue of synthetic field stars that includes the observational biases ( incompleteness and blending ) , for both the acs and wfpc2 data - sets .    once all the contaminant effects are taken into account , the binary fraction was estimated as the number of stars in the _",
    "`` binary population '' _ divided by the total number of stars , i.e. , binaries plus genuine , single , ms stars ( hereafter the _ `` ms population '' _ ) .",
    "the `` ms population '' is defined as the set of stars having a color difference from the ms ridge line ( msrl ) smaller than three times the typical photometric error at that magnitude level ( see figure [ regions ] ) .",
    "the operational definition of the `` binary population '' is given in sects .",
    "[ fmin ] and [ fglob ] .",
    "the high photometric quality and the spatial coverage of the data - sets previously described allowed us to study the binary fraction at different distances from the cluster centre .",
    "in particular , here we have defined three concentric annuli bounded by the core radius and the half - mass radius .",
    "the adopted centre of gravity and structural parameters have been recently determined from resolved star counts ( dalessandro et al .",
    "2011 ) : the coordinates of the centre are @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; the core , half - mass and tidal radii are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this center is located at @xmath34 north - west from the one quoted by goldsbury et al 2010 , a difference that has no impact on the following analysis and the obtained results .",
    "hence , the first two radial bins ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) are sampled by the acs data - set , while the third one ( @xmath37 ) is covered by the wfpc2 data ( see fig .",
    "[ map ] ) . since the two data - sets have different saturation and completeness levels ( see sect .",
    "[ data ] ) , we perfomed the analysis in two different magnitude ranges : the adopted cuts along the msrl are @xmath38 for the acs sample , and @xmath39 for the wfpc2 one ( see figs .",
    "[ cmd ] and [ regions ] ) .",
    "these intervals define what we call the `` _ _ full _ _ magnitude range '' of the two data - sets .",
    "then , with the aim of having an interval of magnitudes in common between the two samples where to directly compare the computed binary fractions , we considered three magnitude sub - ranges defined as follows : a `` _ _ bright _ _ range '' corresponding to @xmath40 , an `` _ _ intermediate _ _ range '' at @xmath41 , and a `` _ _ faint _ _ range '' at @xmath42 ( all the quoted magnitude values are measured along the msrl ) . as is apparent from figs .",
    "[ cmd ] and [ regions ] , the _ bright _ range is probed only by the acs data - set , the _ faint _",
    "range is found only in the wfpc2 sample , while the _ intermediate _ range is in common between the two .",
    "we first estimated the _ minimum binary fraction _",
    "( @xmath43 ) , which is the fraction of binary systems with a mass ratio @xmath23 large enough to make them clearly distinguishable from the single - star ms .",
    "it is clear that the value of @xmath23 depends directly on the photometric errors and @xmath43 represents only a sub - sample of the whole population of binaries , but it has the advantage of being a purely observational quantity . in this case",
    "we define the _ `` binary population '' _ as the set of stars located in the cmd between the following boundaries ( see gray region in fig . [ regions ] ) : the left - hand boundary is the line corresponding to a color difference from the msrl equal to three times the photometric error at any magnitude level ( right dashed line ) ; the right - hand boundary is the line at a color difference from the equal - mass binary sequence equal to three times the photometric error ; the upper and lower boundaries are set by the largest and the smallest primary mass ( corresponding to the quoted bright and faint cuts of the various magnitude ranges along the msrl ) , combined with all the possible mass ratios . in other words ,",
    "the `` binary population '' includes all binary systems with primary mass set by the considered magnitude ranges and with @xmath44 , also taking into account the effect of photometric errors .    for each of the considered radial bins and magnitude ranges we estimated the minimum binary fraction by performing all the steps described in sect .",
    "[ analysis ] and , in much more detail , in s07 .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : fmin ] .",
    "as is apparent , @xmath43 monotonically decreases from the center to the outskirts , in agreement with previous findings and with theoretical predictions ( see sect . [ discuss ] ) . in the _ full _ magnitude range ,",
    "such a radial variation ranges from @xmath45 at @xmath35 , to @xmath46 at @xmath37 .",
    "there also seems to be a trend with magnitude , especially in the central bin , where @xmath43 varies from @xmath47 in the _ bright _ range , to @xmath48 in the _ intermediate _ one .",
    "however , since the photometric error depends on magnitude , the value of @xmath23 changes in the considered luminosity ranges : for decreasing luminosity , @xmath23 varies from 0.5 to 0.6 in both the acs and the wfpc2 samples .",
    "hence , the derived values of @xmath43 are neither strictly comparable to one other , nor to the estimates presented in different works . we have therefore computed the fraction of binaries with mass ratios larger than a fixed value @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this value has been chosen as a compromise between having enough statistics and avoiding contamination from single stars ( indeed , the line corresponding to @xmath49 in the cmd always runs to the right - hand side of the ms population boundary ) . in this case",
    "the `` binary population '' is made up of stars that , in the cmd , are located between the line of constant @xmath49 ( left boundary ; see dotted lines in fig . [ regions ] ) and the right - hand boundary defined above .",
    "its ratio with respect to the total number of stars gives the fraction of binaries with @xmath51 , which is presented in table [ tab : fq06 ] .",
    "obviously , the obtained values are smaller than the corresponding minimum fractions @xmath43 in table [ tab : fmin ] .",
    "we also note that the same behaviors discussed above are still present , thus again suggesting that the trend with magnitude could be real .",
    "one possible explanation for the trend with magnitude could be that _ bright _ range systematically samples more massive stars , which are also expected to be more centrally segregated .      in order to estimate the overall binary content of m10 , independently of the value of @xmath22 , we also computed the _ global binary fraction _",
    "( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this requires us to perform simulations of single and binary star populations assuming different input values of the global binary fraction ( @xmath53 ) and then determining @xmath52 from the comparison between the artificial and the observed cmds : the value of @xmath53 that provides the best match between the two cmds is adopted as the global binary fraction @xmath52 ( see bellazzini et al . 2002 and",
    "s07 for a detailed description of the procedure ) .",
    "once we assumed an input value of the binary fraction ( @xmath53 ) , for each of the considered radial and magnitude bins we have built a sample of @xmath54 and @xmath55 stars , with @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the number of observed objects ( after having taken into accout the number of contaminating field stars , discussed in sect . [ analysis ] ) in that bin , and @xmath54 being @xmath58 .",
    "the ms stars have been simulated by randomly extracting @xmath54 values of the mass from the present - day cluster mass function derived by b10 , the slope of the mass function decreases from @xmath59 to @xmath60 moving from the inner to the outer regions ( for reference , the slope of the canonical salpeter mass function would be @xmath61 ) . in order to understand how the assumed mass function may affect the binary fraction estimates ,",
    "we have re - computed @xmath52 by adopting the core mass function for the whole cluster . within the errors , the resulting values of @xmath52 turn out to be in agreement with those presented in table [ tab : fglob ] , thus guaranteeing that the global binary fraction is just mildly sensitive to changes in the mass function . ] , and transforming the masses into luminosities by using the @xcite isochrones .",
    "then , from the artificial - star catalogue previously described , we have randomly selected an object with similar ( @xmath62 ) magnitude and , if recovered , we assigned its output @xmath13 and @xmath10 magnitudes to the considered ms star . in order to simulate the binary systems we randomly extracted @xmath55 values of the mass of the primary component from the @xcite initial mass function , and @xmath55 values of the binary mass ratio from the @xmath63 distribution observed by @xcite in the solar neighborhood , thus also obtaining the mass of the secondary . after transforming masses into luminosities and summing up the fluxes of the two components , an object with similar magnitude",
    "was randomly extracted from the artificial - star catalogue and , if recovered by the photometric analysis , the shifts between its input and output magnitudes were assigned to the considered binary system .",
    "finally , the field stars were added to the sample .",
    "the result of this procedure is a list of synthetic stars with the same characteristics of real stars and containing a given fraction of binaries ( @xmath53 ) . to be precise ,",
    "the mss of the resulting artificial cmds are narrower than the observed ones , because the formal photometric errors of the artificial star catalogue systematically underestimate the true observational uncertainties .",
    "this is apparent in figure [ photerr ] , where , for the magnitude range @xmath64 , the histogram corresponds to the distribution of the observed color differences @xmath65 with respect to the msrl , the solid line is the best - fitting gaussian of the blue - side of this distribution ( gray histogram ; the red - side has been ignored because it also includes the contribution of binaries and blends ) , and the dashed line is a gaussian with a dispersion obtained by adopting the formal photometric error of the artificial star catalogue . in order to correct for this bias and adopt realistic values of the photometric uncertainty",
    ", we increased the formal errors @xmath66 and @xmath67 thus to reproduce the observed error distribution as a function of magnitude . as a check",
    ", we verified that the width of the resulting color distribution with respect to the msrl well matches the observed one .",
    "an example of the synthetic cmd thus obtained , compared to the observed one is shown in fig .",
    "[ simu ] . from the simulated catalogue",
    "we then computed the ratio @xmath68 between the number of synthetic stars belonging to the `` binary population '' defined in sect .",
    "[ fmin ] , and that of the synthetic `` ms population '' .",
    "the same was done for the observed data - sets , thus obtaining @xmath69 .",
    "for every value of @xmath53 , from @xmath70 to @xmath71 with steps of @xmath70 , the entire procedure was repeated 100 times .",
    "then , the penalty function @xmath72 was computed as the summation of @xmath73 for @xmath74 , and the associated probability @xmath75 was derived . to illustrate this , figure [ prob ]",
    "shows the distribution of @xmath76 as a function of the adopted values of @xmath77 , ranging from 3% to 10% .",
    "the mean of the best - fitting gaussian gives the global binary fraction ( @xmath52 ) and its dispersion has been adopted as the error .",
    "the values of @xmath52 obtained in the various radial and magnitude ranges are reported in table [ tab : fglob ] .",
    "the global binary fraction shows the same radial behavior observed for @xmath43 , varying from @xmath0 or @xmath78 in the cluster core ( for the _ full _ and the _ intermediate _ magnitude ranges , respectively ) , down to @xmath79 in the outskirts ( for both ) . as before we find a dependence of the binary fraction on the magnitude .",
    "this could be an effect of mass segregation , since the average binary mass in the _ bright _ , _ intermediate _ and _ faint _ ranges is @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "however it could also depend on the assumed mass - ratio distribution and the estimate of blended sources , and future studies will be required to resolve this .",
    "we have presented a homogeneous analysis of the binary fraction in m10 as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centre , from the core region , out to @xmath81 . within the errors ,",
    "the derived _",
    "binary fraction is consistent with that measured in other gcs , which have typical values of @xmath52 spanning from @xmath78 to @xmath82 ( s07 ; davis et al .",
    "2008 ) but it is significantly smaller than that estimated for the faintest clusters in the sample of @xcite , which reach also binary fractions @xmath83 .",
    "this is in agreement with the quoted anti - correlation between binary fraction and total luminosity @xcite .",
    "also the binary fraction beyond the half - mass radius ( @xmath84 ) is consistent with previous estimates in gcs ( see table 1 * ? ? ?",
    "the _ minimum _ binary fraction decreases from @xmath45 within @xmath85 , to @xmath46 beyond the half - mass radius .",
    "an analogous trend was found for the fraction of binaries with @xmath86 and for the _ global _ binary fraction ( fig .",
    "[ trend ] ) , the latter varying from @xmath0 to @xmath1 from the core to beyond the half - mass radius .",
    "such a radial behavior is in agreement with what has been previously found in the few other gcs where this kind of investigation has been performed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references in table 1 of davis et al .",
    "it is also in agreement with the expectations of dynamical models , where the effect is essentially due to the mass - segregation process , which leads to an increase in the number of binaries in the cluster cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . indeed , the half - mass relaxation time of m10 ( @xmath87 gyr , harris 1996 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is just a small fraction ( @xmath88 ) of the cluster age ( @xmath89 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it seems safe to conclude that the system has already had time to achieve equipartition .    by comparing the radial variation of the ms stellar mass function derived from the observations , with that obtained in n - body simulations ,",
    "b10 suggested that either an imbh or a population of binaries should be present and act as a central energy source in m10 , supressing the mass - segregation profile .",
    "in particular , the shallow mass - segregation profile could be modeled without an imbh only when the simulations started with a primordial binary fraction of about @xmath90 . within this framework , in figure [ trend ] we compare our derived values of @xmath52 , with those obtained from the dynamical evolution of the 5% primordial binary population in the 32k particle simulation of b10 . for a proper comparison we considered a simulation snapshot at @xmath91 relaxation times , and only those binaries made of two ms stars and with the primary component in the mass range @xmath92 , corresponding to the lower and upper cuts of the _ intermediate _ magnitude range along the msrl .",
    "the resulting binary fractions for the three considered radial bins are : @xmath93 , from the centre to the outskirts .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ trend ] that the observed binary fraction is larger than the simulated one , especially in the core .",
