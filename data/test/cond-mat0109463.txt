    "recent progress in the physics of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of atomic gases ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) stimulated a further development of theoretical methods used previously for the description of superfluidity , superconductivity , and collective effects in heavy atoms and nuclei ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "these methods treat condensates as mean fields , while interactions between particles , according to the bogolubov theory , lead to formation of fluctuations ( see refs.@xcite ) . in the case of a positive scattering length ,",
    "the condensate ( mean field ) is stable , while fluctuations can be treated by using a bogolubov transformation to quasiparticle states .",
    "recent experiments @xcite drew attention to the physics of condensates with a negative scattering length . in this case , a free condensate ( with a homogeneous mean field ) is unstable , collapsing within a finite time @xcite , while a trapped condensate is stable at the low occupations of the experiment @xcite . in the jila experiments on rb @xcite , the effect of feshbach resonance ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) was used for changing the sign of the scattering length .",
    "this effect allows the formation of a condensate with a positive scattering length , followed by a study of the dynamics of collapse after applying a sudden change of sign of the scattering length .",
    "a formal extension of the bogolubov transformation to the case of negative scattering lengths would lead to complex energies of the quasiparticles , but actually such a transformation does not exist in this case , as was proven by bogolubov ( see ref .",
    "nevertheless , the development of fluctuations can substantially affect the dynamics of an unstable condensate ( see the theoretical analysis @xcite of the jila experiments @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper describes the dynamics of fluctuations by using the parametric approximation employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a model problem of a two - mode atom - molecule condensate , and in ref.@xcite for a description of quantum effects on curve crossing .",
    "this method is similar to the parametric approximation used in quantum optics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and in the description of interaction of electromagnetic and matter waves in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it is also closely related to the linearization approximation in quantum soliton theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and to the theory of quantum integrals of motion ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fluctuations are treated here by a linearization of the exact quantum equations of motion for the field operators . in the case of a stable bec ,",
    "the resulting linear equations describe the motion of quantum oscillators , corresponding to the bogolubov quasiparticles .",
    "however , in the case of unstable condensates , these equations describe inverted oscillators , leading to a rapid growth of the fluctuations .",
    "this growth remains super - exponential as long as the fluctuations do not reach a macroscopic occupation .",
    "this dynamics offers a more precise picture compared to the exponential growth obtained from a liapunov analysis of the classical mean field .",
    "initially , the dynamics can be described as a quantum process of spontaneous decay of the condensate into the fluctuation vacuum ( see refs.@xcite ) , accompanied by the formation of entangled pairs ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as in the case of fluctuations in a stable condensate",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the pairs are formed in two - mode squeezed states .",
    "the formally calculated energy of a bogolubov quasiparticle becomes complex also when the energy of the excitation is lower than the energy of a particle in the condensate state .",
    "this case can take place if the condensate itself occupies an excited translational state , as realized recently in the nist experiments on four - wave mixing of atomic condensate waves @xcite .",
    "the loss of condensate atoms in such a situation was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the method of complex scattering lengths , without taking into account second - quantized properties of the atomic scattering .",
    "the results of the present theory , which take into account these properties , are in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite at short collision times [ see eq.([ndotstat ] ) below ] .",
    "however , at long collision times the effects of bose enhancement lead to a substantial increase of the losses [ see eq .",
    "( [ ndotenh ] ) below ] .",
    "notice that the necessity of accounting for the quantum effects was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite itself .",
    "these effects should appear under the conditions of the nist experiments @xcite .",
    "the present method can describe only qualitatively this case of large losses , comparable in magnitude to the initial occupation .",
    "this case may be treated by the incorporation of quantum effects into the slowly - varying - envelope approximation developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "quantum effects on the loss incurred by collisions of two condensate wavepackets were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , using an approach similar to the present one . however , the results of the present work disagree with those of ref .",
    "the losses quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which have been evaluated only for short collision times , differ also from the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "these disagreements are apparently due to some unjustified neglections in ref .  @xcite ( see discussion in sec .  [ gauss ] ) .    as in the case of fluctuations in a ground - state condensate ,",
    "the scattered particles are formed here in entangled ( squeezed ) states .",
    "therefore the processes considered here may open up possibilities for the formation of an entangled gas remained after the decay of a condensate , or after the collision of wavepackets .",
