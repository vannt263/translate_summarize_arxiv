    "the constellation of orion has pulled in the attention of astronomers and sky - watchers since the ancient times : it was mentioned in the bible , homer s odyssey and virgil s aeneid , has been widely used in celestial navigation , and represented important characters , deities , or tools in mythologies all over the world ( it was the babylonian shepherd of anu , the finnish vinminen , and the julpan , a canoe of the australian aborigines ) . within the constellation ,",
    "the prominent orion belt , formed by alnitak ( @xmath2  ori ) , alnilam ( @xmath3  ori ) , and mintaka ( @xmath4  ori ) , is perhaps the most famous asterism in the sky . thought to be mapped in the giza pyramid complex by the ancient egyptians , the orion belt has also been of great significance in other cultures : it was the scandinavian freyja s distaff , the iberian tres maras , the northern - european three kings , and the chinese lunar mansion shen ( literally `` three '' in chinese ) . the fourth brightest star in the orion belt , about 2mag fainter than the three main stars , is @xmath0  ori . the star , which is actually the hierarchical multiple trapezium - like stellar system that illuminates the famous horsehead nebula , has taken a great importance in the last decade .",
    "its significance lies in the very early spectral type of the hottest component ( @xmath0  ori  a , o9.5v ) and in the homonymous star cluster that surrounds the system ( garrison 1967 ) .",
    "the @xmath0  orionis star cluster , re - discovered due to its large number of x - ray emitters ( wolk 1996 ) , contains one of the best known brown dwarf and planetary - mass object populations ( bjar et  al .",

    "approximate canonical ages , heliocentric distances and visual extinctions are @xmath5 3ma , @xmath6 385pc and @xmath7 0.3mag .",
    "the knowledge of the whole stellar and substellar populations in a cluster in general , and in @xmath0  orionis in particular , has serious implications on the accuracy of the determination of some important parameters , such asthe slope of the initial mass function , frequency of discs , and degree of radial concentration .",
    "these observational parameters are , in their turn , fundamental for the theoretical scenarios that predict the formation of stars , brown dwarfs , and planets . the mayrit catalogue of stars and brown dwarfs in the @xmath0  orionis cluster , built by caballero ( 2008b ) , was an effort to compile key data on confirmed and candidate cluster members .",
    "the basis of that work was an optical - near infrared correlation between the 2mass and denis catalogues in a circular area of radius 30arcmin contred on the @xmath0  ori stellar system .",
    "the analysis was supported by an exhaustive bibliographic search of confirmed cluster members with signposts of youth and by additional x - ray , mid - infrared , and astrometric data .",
