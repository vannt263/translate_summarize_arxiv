    "more then ten years ago , the discovery that centimetre size samples of decagonal _ d_-alcuco and icosahedral _ i_-alpdmn could be grown opened up the possibility of surface studies of these quasicrystals  @xcite . since then other quasicrystal samples have been grown to similar dimensions . to date , most surface studies have been performed on the five - fold surface of _",
    "a consensus has emerged from these studies that this surface , after fairly standard ultra - high - vacuum ( uhv ) sputtering and annealing procedures , is itself quasicrystalline . in this work , using a combined experimental and theoretical approach , we show that this surface can be considered to be a termination of the known bulk structure  @xcite .",

    "the dark pentagons observed on the surface corresponded to the bergman polytopes   in the bulk layers .",
    "the position of a given type of terrace was matched to a layer characterized by a density of certain bergman polytopes and their distribution pattern .",
    "we assumed that the surface termination respects the integrity of the bergman polytopes as clusters , at least in the most dense layers , and we supposed that such a layer of bergman polytopes is exactly below the termination .",
    "however , under these assumptions it was not possible to explain the observed edge - length ( circa @xmath6  ) of the dark pentagonal holes , as this was bigger by the factor @xmath7 than the pentagonal surfaces of the bergman polytope ( circa @xmath8  )  @xcite .",
