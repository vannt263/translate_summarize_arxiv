    "unification physics has traditionally been seen as the problem of reconciling wildly disparate mass scales , for example the weak scale ( @xmath0gev ) and the planck scale ( @xmath1gev ) .",
    "this exponential hierarchy is technically unnatural in particle physics , since in general , the effects of renormalization are to make the observable values of such scales much closer in size . well - known attempts to address this issue , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) in which delicate cancellations between renormalization terms occur , or technicolor , in which the renormalization effects are much less dramatic than one might ordinarily expect , function by preventing dramatic corrections to an externally imposed mass hierarchy .    a fresh perspective on the problem of unification has received much attention in recent years @xcite . in this picture",
    "the hierarchy problem is is no longer a disparity between mass scales , and instead becomes an issue of length scales .",
    "the new approach is a superstring - inspired modification of the kaluza - klein idea that the universe may have more spatial dimensions than the three that we observe .",
    "the general hypothesis is that the universe as a whole is @xmath2 dimensional , with gravity propagating in all dimensions , but the standard model fields are confined to a @xmath3 dimensional submanifold that comprises our observable universe .",
    "the primary motivation for this comes from polchinski s discovery @xcite of @xmath4-branes in string theory .",
    "these extended objects have the property that open strings , the excitations of which correspond to standard model particles , may end on them , and thus are confined to the brane . however , closed string excitations , corresponding to gravitational degrees of freedom are free to occur anywhere in the space .",
    "as in traditional kaluza - klein theories , it is necessary that all dimensions other than those we observe be compactified , so that their existence does not conflict with experimental data .",
    "the difference in the new scenarios is that , since standard model fields do not propagate in the extra dimensions , it is only necessary to evade constraints on higher - dimensional gravity , and not , for example , on higher - dimensional electromagnetism . as we shall see , this is important , since electromagnetism is tested to great precision down to extremely small scales , whereas microscopic tests of gravity are far less precise",
    ".    since constraints on the new scenarios are less stringent than those on ordinary kaluza - klein theories , the corresponding extra dimensions can be significantly larger , which translates into a much larger allowed volume for the extra dimensions .",
    "it is the spreading of gravitational flux into this large volume that allows gravity measured on our @xmath5-brane to be so weak ( parameterized by the planck mass , @xmath6 ) , while the fundamental scale of physics @xmath7 is parameterized by the weak scale , @xmath8 say .",
    "thus , the problem of understanding the hierarchy between the planck and weak scales now becomes that of understanding why extra dimensions are stabilized at a volume large in units of the fundamental length scale @xmath9 .",
    "this is the rephrasing of the hierarchy problem in these models .",
    "it constitutes a fundamental shift in thinking .",
    "traditionally , these large compact extra dimensions have been conceived of as d - tori , or d - spheres . in this setting , one has the added bonus of requiring a linear tuning of length scales , compared to the usual exponential tuning of mass scales . nevertheless , a significant tuning is still required , although now in an entirely different sector of the theory .    in recent",
    "work @xcite two of us proposed a modification to the above picture , in which we argued that there exist attractive alternate choices of compactification .",
    "these compactifications employ a topologically non - trivial internal space  a @xmath10-dimensional compact hyperbolic manifold ( chm ) .",
    "they also throw into a new light the problem of explaining the large hierarchy @xmath11 , since even though the volume of these manifolds is large , their linear size @xmath12 is only slightly larger than the new fundamental length scale ( @xmath13 for example ) , thus only requiring numbers of @xmath14 .",
    "further , cosmology in such spaces has interesting consequences for the evolution of the early universe @xcite . in the next section we provide a brief review of the relevant properties of chms .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present a detailed analysis of radion stabilization in these models .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated @xcite that , in the context of general relativity in @xmath15 dimensions , stabilization of large hyperbolic extra dimensions , leaving minkowski space on our brane , requires a violation of the null dominant energy condition . in section [ stabilization ]",
    "we extend this argument to the case in which our brane is allowed to exhibit standard frw expansion , and comment on the regime of validity of this result .",
    "we then turn to possible ways in which stabilization may work due to a breakdown of the assumptions in the previous argument or through quantum stabilization effects .",
    "we provide an explicit example of this possibility through the casimir force in chms .",
    "for completeness we include some final comments on supersymmetry in compact hyperbolic backgrounds before concluding .",
    "a @xmath10-dimensional compact hyperbolic manifold has spatial sections of the form @xmath16 , where the fundamental group , @xmath17 , is a discrete subgroup of @xmath18 acting freely ( _ ie . _ without fixed points ) and discontinuously ( since it is discrete ) . the chm can be obtained by gluing together the faces of a fundamental domain in hyperbolic space .    hyperbolic space in @xmath10 dimensions can be viewed as the hyperboloid @xmath19 embedded in @xmath20-dimensional minkowski space . in the simple case @xmath21 , of particular interest in this paper , we can use the coordinate identifications @xmath22 to relate this representation to the induced metric @xmath23\\ ] ] on @xmath24 .",
    "> from this perspective it is easy to understand why the isometries of @xmath24 are described by the orientation preserving homogeneous lorentz group in 4-dimensions , @xmath25 .    to illustrate the features of compact hyperbolic spaces , we will consider the thurston manifold @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ thurston ] ) .",
    "one particularly useful way to study this and other compact hyperbolic spaces is to use the _ snappea _ @xcite catalogue .",
    "the thurston manifold @xmath26",
    "( m003(-2,3 ) in the _ snappea _ census ) has fundamental group , @xmath27 , with presentation @xmath28    here @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the generators of the fundamental group , describing identifications in the faces of the fundamental cell shown in fig .",
    "[ thurston ] , and in usual group - theoretic notation the expressions following the colon in equation  ( [ fun ] ) are set equal to the identify .",
    "the fundamental cell is drawn using klein s projective model for hyperbolic space . in this projection @xmath24",
    "is mapped into an open ball in euclidean @xmath5-space @xmath31 . under this mapping",
    "hyperbolic lines and planes are mapped into their euclidean counterparts .",
    "this is why the totally geodesic faces of the fundamental cell appear as flat planes .",
    "thurston s manifold has volume approximately @xmath32 .    by acting on points lying on the symmetry axis of each group element",
    "it is possible to compile a list of the the minimal geodesics .",
    "a typical isometry is a clifford translation  a corkscrew type motion , consisting of a translation of length @xmath12 along a geodesic , combined with a simultaneous rotation through an angle @xmath33 about the same geodesic .",
    "the length and torsion can be found directly from the eigenvalues of the group element , and are conveniently listed by the _ snappea _",
    "program@xcite .",
    "we can make some general observations about the existence of long wavelength modes on @xmath34 .",
    "in large volume chm s there is generically a gap in the spectrum of the laplacian ( more specifically , the laplace - beltrami operator ) between the zero mode and the next lowest mode . a theorem due to sarnak in @xmath35 and a conjecture due to brooks in @xmath36 state ( approximately ) that for large volumes characteristically @xmath37 .",
    "this puts an upper limit on the wavelength of modes .",
    "we are interested in chms as extra - dimensional manifolds . because they are locally negatively curved , chm s exist only for @xmath38 .",
    "their properties are well understood only for @xmath39 , however , it is known that chm s in dimensions @xmath40 possess the important property of _ rigidity _ @xcite . as a result , these manifolds have no massless shape moduli .",
    "hence , the stabilization of such internal spaces reduces to the problem of stabilizing a single modulus , the curvature length or the `` radion . ''",
    "the primary reason for considering such manifolds for compactification is the behavior of their volume as a function of linear size . in general , the total volume of a smooth compact hyperbolic space in any number of dimensions is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the curvature radius and @xmath43 is a constant _ determined by topology_. ( for @xmath21 it is known that there is a countable infinity of orientable chm s , with dimensionless volumes , @xmath44 , bounded from below , but unbounded from above ; moreover the @xmath44 do not become sparsely distributed with large volume . ) in addition , because the topological invariant @xmath45 characterizes the volume of the chm , it is also a measure of the largest distance @xmath12 around the manifold .",
    "chm s are globally anisotropic ; however , since the largest linear dimension gives the most significant contribution to the volume , there exists an approximate relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    "the appropriate asymptotic relation , dropping irrelevant angular factors , is @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "thus , in strong contrast to the flat case , the expression for @xmath6 depends _ exponentially on the linear size _",
    "@xmath50 \\ .\\ ] ] the most interesting case ( and as we will see later , most reasonable ) is the smallest possible curvature radius , @xmath51 .",
    "taking @xmath52  tev then yields ( with @xmath53 ) @xmath54 therefore , one of the most attractive features of chm s is that to generate an exponential hierarchy between @xmath55  tev , and @xmath6 only requires that the linear size @xmath12 be very mildly tuned if the internal space is a chm .",
    "our starting point is the action for einstein gravity in a @xmath56-dimensional space - time , with bulk matter .",
    "s = d^4+d+nx  , where @xmath57 is the @xmath56-dimensional planck mass and @xmath58 is the lagrangian density .",
    "we will assume that the geometry of the bulk space @xmath59 is factorizable into the form ^4+d+n = f^3 + 1 h^d / s^n  , where @xmath60 denotes a @xmath3-dimensional friedmann , robertson - walker ( frw ) space , @xmath61 is a @xmath10-dimensional compact hyperbolic manifold and @xmath62 is the @xmath63-sphere , with volume @xmath64 .",
    "we have included a spherical factor here because of the hope that its curvature will play a role in cancelling that of the hyperboloid .",
    "as we shall see this is not sufficient . in demonstrating this",
    "it will become clear that adding other factors will not help the situation .",
    "therefore this choice of manifold seems sufficiently general to prove our result .",
    "the metric ansatz consistent with this factorization is ds^2=g_abdx^adx^b=|g_dx^dx^+ r_h^2_ijdy^idy^j + r_s^2_abdz^a dz^b  . here",
    "@xmath65 are indices on the whole bulk space - time , @xmath66 are indices on the @xmath3 dimensional brane , @xmath67 are indices on the chm and @xmath68 are indices on the sphere .",
    "the metric on the brane is denoted by @xmath69 , that on the unit @xmath10-hyperboloid by @xmath70 and the metric on the unit @xmath63-sphere by @xmath71 .",
    "there are therefore two radion fields in the problem , @xmath72 , the curvature radius of the chm , and @xmath73 , the curvature radius of the sphere .",
    "we will denote the values of these radii at their putative stable points by @xmath42 and @xmath74 respectively . by the volume considerations of the previous section , the effective @xmath3-dimensional planck mass",
    "will then be given by m^2_4=m^2+d+n(r_h^d e^)(r_s^n _ n )  .",
    "there are two ways to analyze the issue of stabilization in extra - dimensional theories .",
    "we may consider the full @xmath56-dimensional equations , or those of the dimensionally reduced @xmath3 dimensional theory . for completeness we will express the problem in an effective theory setting and",
    "then demonstrate our main result in the full theory .    to derive our effective theory ,",
    "let us define the fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 by r_h & = & r_h + r_s & = & r_s  , and perform a conformal rescaling of the brane metric    the reduced einstein tensor .",
    "integrating over the compact manifolds , we may now define an effective action @xmath77 by s_4+d+n = d^d+nxe^ _ ns_eff  , with s_eff = d^4x  . here , the effective rescaled potential is w(,,g)&=&()l_bulk + + & + & m_4 ^ 2  , where we have used that @xmath78 .    in this language",
    "the stabilization of the two radii translates into the following obvious system of equations : _",
    "w|_(,)=0=0 & , & ^2_w|_(,)=0>0 + _ w|_(,)=0=0 & , & ^2_w|_(,)=0>0  , [ condition1 ] plus the condition that the effective four - dimensional cosmological constant vanish , = .(g_w -2 ) |_(,)=0=0  .",
    "[ condition2 ]    in the full theory we shall adopt a cosmological approach and assume that , whatever bulk matter is present , its energy - momentum tensor can be expressed in perfect fluid form on each of the submanifolds t_00 & = & + t _ & = & p|g _ + t_ij & = & qr_h^2_ij + t_ab & = & sr_s^2_ab  , [ emtensor ] where @xmath43 , @xmath79 .",
    "the einstein equations then become & & = 3 + 12m^2+d+n + & & p=--12m^2+d+n + & & q=-3 - 12m^2+d+n + & & s=-3 - 12m^2+d+n  .",
    "[ eqn5 ] the null energy condition , @xmath80 for all null @xmath56-vectors @xmath81 , in conjunction with the ansatz  ( [ emtensor ] ) yields + p & & 0 + + q & & 0 + + s & & 0  , which then implies + ( a)^2 -a & & 0 [ nec1 ] + a & & -16[nec2 ] + a & & 16  . [ nec3 ]    it is relatively straightforward to see how these inequalities are incompatible with a reasonable cosmological evolution on the brane . note first that  ( [ nec2 ] ) implies  ( [ nec3 ] ) .",
    "thus  ( [ nec2 ] ) is the important inequality to deal with .",
    "successful @xmath3-dimensional cosmology requires a radiation dominated phase ( in order that successful nucleosynthesis occur ) , followed by a matter dominated phase .",
    "focusing on the radiation dominated phase , the scale factor evolves as @xmath82 , which means that .|_radiation = -  . therefore ,",
    "certainly when the universe is older than than @xmath83 , the null energy condition is violated .",
    "since nucleosynthesis occurs at a later time than this , it is clear that , even in the most optimistic case the model is not cosmologically viable .",
    "therefore we conclude that any bulk matter that stabilizes the radion and gives rise to an acceptable cosmology on the brane must violate the null energy condition .",
    "note further that , in the special case that we restrict our brane to be @xmath3-dimensional minkowski space - time and restrict the extra - dimensional manifold to be purely a chm ( no @xmath62 factor ) , our constraints simplify ( see @xcite ) considerably to become & = & - + p & = & + q & = &  .",
    "[ eqn3 ] in this case it is simple to see that the required matter field can not obey the null energy condition .",
    "consider a general null vector with spatial components in the direction of the hyperboloid , for example n = _",
    "t+e_i  , where @xmath84 is an orthogonal vector basis on the hyperboloid .",
    "contracting the energy - momentum tensor twice with this vector yields t_abn^a n^b = - < 0",
    ". hence the required matter must violate the null energy condition .    to clarify the above general statement ,",
    "let us consider a simple example of bulk matter that one might expect to stabilize our chm .",
    "for this example we ll stay within the simplified context of requiring minkowski space to be the solution on our brane , as above .",
    "our bulk matter will consist of a cosmological constant @xmath85 and a d - form @xmath86}$ ] over the hyperbolic manifold .",
    "the bulk lagrangian density is therefore _",
    "the resulting field equations for @xmath86}$ ] can be solved by the ansatz f_abc & = & 0 + f_45 .. d+4 & = & b(x^ )  , so that @xmath87 is independent of the hyperbolic coordinates . with this ansatz",
    "there results a trapped magnetic flux on the compact hyperbolic space and the constant @xmath87 is related to the radion @xmath72 by the equation b = bm^(d+4)/2()^d  .",
    "thus the on - shell form of the bulk lagrangian density becomes _ bulk = m^d+4  .",
    "defining @xmath88 , equations  ( [ condition1 ] ) and  ( [ condition2 ] ) reduce to + b^2 2 + d(d-1)^2 & = & 0 , + b^2d+d(d-1)(d+2)^2 & = & 0  .",
    "the corresponding solution is & = & -(d-1)(d-2 ) + b^2 & = & -(d-1)(d+2)^2  . using these solutions",
    ", the on - shell stress energy tensor of the d - form becomes t_ab=(d-1)(d-2)^28(g_ab-^ij_abg_ij )  , therefore when contracted twice with a null vector along one of the hyperbolic directions ( i.e. @xmath89 ) , we obtain t_ab n^a n^b=-(d-1)(d-2)^28g_iin^i n^i < 0  , clearly violating the null energy condition .",
    "although classical fluids are expected to respect the null energy condition , it is well known that such conditions are violated quantum mechanically .",
    "a specific example of such violation is casimir energy density  the zero point energy density of the quantum fields on the space time .",
    "the magnitude and sign of the casimir energy depend in complicated ways on the topology and geometry of the underlying manifold , and on the specific field content ( for an example of the use of the casimir force in stabilizing extra - dimensional models see @xcite ) .",
    "let us continue to consider the simplified example space - time and further focus on the case in which the extra - dimensional manifold is @xmath5-dimensional , @xmath90 the casimir energy density will depend on both the details of @xmath17 , and on the curvature @xmath42 of the @xmath24 , @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "thus the casimir pressure in the @xmath34 directions will be proportional to @xmath93 , while the pressure will be zero in the minkowski space directions . since the null energy condition would require that when the casimir energy density , @xmath94 is negative the associated pressure is isotropic and equal to @xmath95 , the null energy condition is therefore violated .",
    "interestingly , with @xmath96 , the sign of the energy density and the pressure are precisely right to help stabilize @xmath34 .    because of the chaotic nature of flows on chms",
    ", we do not present any generic results for the value of @xmath94 in specific chms , except to note that the case of a minimally coupled scalar field on the thurston manifold has been studied numerically by miller , fagundes and opher @xcite . in this study they discovered that the casimir energy density can be negative , as needed for stabilizing the extra - dimensional manifold in our model .",
    "an understanding of the casimir energy in the specific highly topologically complex manifolds used in our model would be extremely useful , but seems calculationally formidable and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a question of great interest when suggesting any compactification scheme is that of low - energy supersymmetry . for the case of interest in this paper",
    ", we may begin with an explicit construction of the killing spinors of maximally symmetric spaces with negative cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "for the space @xmath97 we choose coordinates in the horospherical frame in which the metric takes the form , ds^2=e^2r_dx^dx^+dr^2  . in this frame ,",
    "the killing spinors are given by , = e^12 r_r  , where @xmath98 is an arbitrary constant spinor ( the cases d=2,3 are special and expressions can be found in ref   @xcite ) .",
    "we can see from this expression that the number of supersymmetries of @xmath97 is equal to the number of independent spinor components .",
    "now , recall that the isometry group is @xmath99 and that compact hyperbolic manifolds are obtained by quotient of @xmath97 by a discrete subgroup @xmath17 of @xmath99 , with no fixed points .",
    "whether or not any killing spinors survive this quotienting process depends on @xmath17 @xcite .    1 .   if d is even then the spinors are in an @xmath100 representation , and all supersymmetries are broken .",
    "2 .   if @xmath10 is odd , then the spinors are in an @xmath99 representation . in this case",
    "there are several possibilities",
    "if @xmath17 is a subgroup of @xmath100 some killing spinors may survive , since we can decompose the original killing spinors into weyl spinors on the representation of this group .",
    "if @xmath17 is a not subgroup of @xmath100 then all supersymmetries are broken .",
    "3 .   in the special case @xmath21 there also remain no supersymmetries .",
    "the initial motivation for the idea of large extra dimensions was to address the hierarchy problem .",
    "allowing the internal space to be a compact hyperbolic manifold @xcite introduces the attractive new feature that the hierarchy problem becomes a truly mild tuning of the length scales in the theory .",
    "in addition , such models have been shown to have interesting cosmological consequences @xcite .",
    "of course , in all extra - dimensional models , the stabilization of the radion mode is an essential component , since the effective four - dimensional gravitational constant does not change today .",
    "one advantage of chms as internal spaces is that in three or more dimensions the property of rigidity means that there is a single radion ",
    "the curvature radius of the manifold . nevertheless , stabilization of this single mode remains an important issue in these models .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the constraints on the bulk matter that is required to achieve this necessary stabilization .",
    "we have allowed for the metric on the brane to be cosmological , of frw form , and in this sense we have expanded on the elegant results of @xcite which apply to the case that the brane is minkowski .",
    "our results apply to extra dimensions large enough that general relativity is a valid theory , and show that stabilization may only be achieved by bulk matter that violates the weak energy condition .",
    "we have demonstrated this result explicitly , and have provided an example of how a specific example of matter violates this condition .",
    "since such violations are problematic for classical matter , quantum effects may be crucial in stabilizing these manifolds .",
    "in fact , since the essential feature that makes chms so attractive is their large volume without large linear spatial extent , the assumption that general relativity is completely valid may break down . as a specific example we have suggested the casimir effect as such a quantum contribution . while simple estimates indicate that this may be a successful way to stabilize chms , we caution that to understand the effect in the manifolds that are useful for brane - world models is a much more difficult task .    finally , although independent from the issue of stabilization , for completeness we have briefly discussed the ways in which supersymmetry in compact hyperbolic extra dimensions can be broken due to the obstructions to defining covariantly constant spinors on these spaces .    * acknowledgments * + the work of sn and gds is supported by grants from the u.s .",
