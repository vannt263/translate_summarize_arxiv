    "the study of the electronic structure of materials usually begins with noninteracting electrons due to the vast number of particles involved .",

    "the favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency makes the resulting dft and tddft schemes unrivaled for large but finite system sizes.@xcite    considerable effort has been spent to replicate this success of tddft for periodic solids.@xcite generally speaking , tddft works very well for simple metallic systems , where the excitation spectrum is dominated by collective plasmon modes .",
    "the reason is that common local and semilocal exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals are based on the homogeneous electron liquid as reference system , which is an ideal starting point to describe electrons in metals .",
    "the situation is more complicated in insulators and semiconductors .",
    "the first problem that comes to mind is that of the band gap , which is typically strongly underestimated by most popular xc functionals of dft . in principle",
    ", tddft provides a mechanism to obtain the correct band gap,@xcite but this puts very strong demands on the xc kernel @xmath0 ( it has to simulate a discontinuity , which requires a strong frequency dependence ) .",
    "the second difficulty are excitonic effects .",
    "it is a well - known fact that standard local and semilocal xc functionals do not produce any excitonic binding;@xcite again , the proper choice of @xmath0 is crucial .",
    "there are many examples in the literature of successful tddft calculations of excitonic effects , using exact exchange , @xcite an effective xc kernel engineered from the bse,@xcite a meta - gga kernel,@xcite and a recent ` bootstrap ' xc kernel.@xcite these kernels all have in common that they have a long spatial range ; however , it has also been shown that certain excitonic features can be equally well reproduced by simple short - range kernels .",
    "@xcite this calls for further explanation .    due to the complexity of real solids ,",
    "the question of the general requirements for excitonic binding in tddft has been difficult to analyze . as a first step towards a simplified tddft approach for excitons ,",
    "a two - band model was recently developed , which was used to test the performance of simple xc kernels for calculating excitonic binding energies in several iii - v and ii - vi semiconductors.@xcite in this paper we will push this reductionist approach further and propose a minimal tddft model for excitons .",
    "our model is one - dimensional ( 1d ) and uses two simple kronig - penney - type bands as input .",

    "the model is accessible and relatively easy to implement , and it can be used to identify important aspects of the xc functional for excitonic effects .",
    "it clearly shows that excitons are collective excitations of the many - body system : the appropriate phase - coherent mixing of the single - particle excitations is accomplished via a coupling matrix featuring @xmath0 .",

    "the electronic states form energy bands . in insulators and semiconductors , electronic excitations take place between the occupied ( valence ) and unoccupied ( conduction ) bands .",
    "these interband transitions can be described within a simple independent - particle approach based on fermi s golden rule ; one thus obtains a reasonable qualitative account of the optical properties in these materials.@xcite        however , experiments reveal that there are important modifications to this picture , as illustrated schematically in fig . [",
    "fig : bkgnd : illustrationexcitons ] . above the band gap , the spectrum appears strongly enhanced , and below the band gap one may find discrete absorption peaks known as bound excitons .",
    "the origin of these modifications are coulomb interactions : the simple picture of independent single - particle excitations is replaced by a more complex scenario where these excitations are dynamically coupled .",
    "excitonic effects are ubiquitous in nature , and occur in 3d , 2d and 1d systems alike.@xcite the details of the excitonic modifications to the noninteracting spectrum depend on the dimensionality of the system.@xcite        the standard textbook explanation of excitons is based on the simple picture of an electron - hole pair held together by coulomb interactions , see fig .",

    "sham and rice@xcite showed how the wannier equation can be derived from first principles starting from the bse , under the assumption that the bohr radius of the exciton is much bigger than the lattice constant .",
    "the resulting wannier picture of excitons appears clear and intuitive , but this simplicity is somewhat deceptive . in reality , excitons are a dynamical many - body phenomenon and require a subtle coordination and cooperation of many single - particle transitions between two bands . in the following , we will develop a model based on tddft which will illustrate the true physical nature of excitons , but which will remain sufficiently transparent to allow a simple interpretation of the collective many - body effects that are responsible for the excitonic binding .",

    "a square - well potential of finite depth does not support an infinite number of bound states as the coulomb potential does ; but this , in fact , closely reflects the reality of the effective potential felt by the valence electrons in a solid , which is relatively shallow due to the screening of the bare nuclear charges by the core electrons . in practice , many solid - state calculations account for this screening by using muffin - tin potentials or pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite the kp model can be viewed as an elementary version of this approach .    in the following , we always choose the first two bands to be fully occupied and the higher bands to be empty .",

    "consists of the following two ingredients :    \\(1 ) a two - band model for the vertical transitions between the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band , see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bkgnd : rhocvspa ] ) ;    \\(2 ) the band structure from a 1d kp model .",

    "this long - range part is thought to be essential for excitons.@xcite    the long - range behavior of @xmath35 depends on the dimensionality , and in our 1d model system we define the following long - ranged ( or ` soft - coulomb ' ) xc kernel : @xmath82 we also consider an extremely short - ranged contact xc kernel : @xmath83 these model xc kernels depend on the constants @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which we will treat as fitting parameters in the following .",
    "the idea is to tune the parameters in the model xc kernels so that bound excitons are produced , and to align the lowest bound exciton in the tddft spectrum with the lowest bound exciton in the bse spectrum .",

[ fig : results : tddftoneexciton ] and [ fig : results : tddfttwoexcitons ] show several identifiable bound excitons , in agreement with the rydberg series predicted by the wannier model ; the number of visible bound excitons somewhat depends on the numerical resolution in momentum space .    for the kp model parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : results : tddftoneexciton ] , we find that the adiabatic tddft can only bind a single excitonic state .",
