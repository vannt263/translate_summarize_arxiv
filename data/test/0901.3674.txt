    "the presence of non - abelian anyons gives rise to degeneracy in the energy spectrum and the evolution is described by a unitary matrix acting on the degenerate states . in general",
    ", anyons are known to exist in different varieties distinguished by their characteristic statistics @xcite . therefore , the explicit demonstration of the statistical behavior is essential for the unique characterization of a topological phase .",
    "such phases are of great interest due to the possibility of realizing anyons in a physical system and due to their potential for technological applications . in particular",

    "these systems are either tailored to identically support non - abelian statistics and have complex physical realizations , or they can be described by simple hamiltonians , but their statistical behavior is based on indirect arguments . in particular , for the fractional quantum hall states they rely on properties of trial wave functions  @xcite , whereas for the lattice models explicit calculations have not been previously attempted .",
    "although the indirect arguments are sound , direct calculations of the statistics are crucial to resolve any ambiguities , to address physical realizable finite - size systems and to provide exact predictions for the experiments .    here",
    "we demonstrate how to directly calculate the non - abelian statistics for a class of exactly solvable models . by applying the berry phase technique @xcite to the kitaev s honeycomb spin lattice model  @xcite",
    ", we calculate the evolution associated with an adiabatic exchange of quasiparticles .",
    "this is performed using exact eigenstates of a 360 spin system .",
    "we obtain a unitary matrix that corresponds to the statistics of the conjectured non - abelian ising anyons .",
    "together with the fusion rules of these anyons  @xcite , this conclusively demonstrates the non - abelian character of kitaev s model , thereby confirming the conjectured behavior .",

    "consequently , the plaquette operators @xmath39 can be identified with gauge invariant wilson loop operators , whose patterns of eigenvalues label the physical sectors of the model . fixing the gauge field configuration @xmath35",

    "however , the inner product of two such vectors , each depending possibly on some parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 , can be efficiently calculated and is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73_{kl } = \\psi_k^{-\\dagger}(t ) \\psi_l^-(t')$ ] .",
    "it has been conjectured that kitaev s model supports the ising anyon model  @xcite .",
    "this model has three types of particles : @xmath74 ( vacuum ) , @xmath75 ( fermion ) and @xmath76 ( non - abelian anyon ) . in  @xcite these",

    "the non - trivial fusion rules are given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the last fusion rule implies that there is a degree of freedom associated with the different ways a number of @xmath76 s can fuse when their total anyonic charge is fixed .",

    ", @xmath80 .",
    "its basis can be chosen to be the states associated with the two distinct pair - wise fusion channels : @xmath81 in @xcite the number of intermediate @xmath75 s is identified with the number of occupied zero modes .",
    "hence , a suitable basis is given by the states @xmath82 ( see ( [ basisrep ] ) ) .",
    "the braid operator , @xmath83 , describes the statistics of the @xmath76 anyons .",
    "in particular , the _ monodromy _ operator , @xmath84 , corresponds to one particle encircling another clockwise . on the basis  ( [ vbasis ] )",

    "in real physical systems the permutation of the coordinates corresponds to adiabatically transporting the anyons such that their positions are swapped .",
    "when the positions are swapped twice , i.e. a particle winds around the other along a suitable chosen path , the statistics corresponds to the accumulated wave function evolution , which is given by the berry phase , or the _ holonomy _ @xcite . for bosons and fermions",

    "it follows that the holonomy takes the form @xmath99 i.e. in the limit @xmath100 it is given by the ordered product of projectors onto the ground state space at each step @xmath70 .",
    "we evaluate the evolution in the fusion space @xmath80 .",
    "the basis states  ( [ basisrep ] ) are not symmetrized under gauge transformations ( [ d ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , their holonomy coincides with the holononomy of symmetrized states when @xmath10 is a loop in both the space of four vortex and gauge field configurations .",
    "this is due to the orthogonality of states belonging to different sectors of @xmath35 .",
    "a suitable path is illustrated in  ( a ) , where the path @xmath10 ( dashed lines ) is split into four parts .",
    "different ordering of these parts corresponds to the topologically inequivalent paths @xmath101 and @xmath102 given in  ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "neither path spans any area and hence all contribution to the holonomy is topological .",
    "since @xmath35 is a static background field , we need to introduce classical control parameters to physically implement the transport . assuming local control of @xmath28 and @xmath18 on all links , we see from  ( [ a ] ) that the simultaneous sign change of these quantities on link @xmath16 is equivalent to changing @xmath103 .",
    "this either generates a vortex pair or transports a vortex through the link @xmath16 . in our simulation",
    "this is performed in @xmath104 infinitesimal steps .",
    "taking @xmath105 and assuming @xmath96 to be a sufficiently large , the discrete holonomy  ( [ dhol ] ) for the degenerate states ( [ basisrep ] ) is well approximated by @xmath106 where we have used the inner product ( [ inner ] ) of the path @xmath10 gives rise to an accumulated unitary matrix , @xmath107 , making the result of the adiabatic evolution to be in general given by @xmath108  @xcite . here",

    "these are plotted in  , where we observe that both the fermion gap and the level of degeneracy improve as @xmath117 and @xmath3 increase . under the adiabatic approximation the holonomy corresponds to the exact time evolution when @xmath118 and @xmath119 . to physically accommodate these conditions in a finite size system",

    "this region can support the adiabaticity conditions and hence we take @xmath123 as a lower bound for identifying a stable topological phase .    to quantitatively study the holonomy , we introduce a fidelity measure for a target matrix @xmath89 and a test matrix @xmath124 as @xmath125 for @xmath89 , @xmath124 unitary @xmath126 matrices we have that @xmath127 if and only if @xmath128 , while in general @xmath129 .",

    "first , we observe that the unitarity measure is above @xmath143 for all parametrizations when @xmath144 , which we take as an upper bound for identifying a stable topological phase . for ( i )",
    "we obtain no significant off - diagonality due to the small size of the system .",
    "however , for ( ii ) the holonomy is predominantly off - diagonal ( e.g. @xmath145 ) for @xmath146 , and for ( iii ) for @xmath147 . the total fidelity , @xmath148 , accounts also for the overall phase and can distinguish between the ising ( @xmath149 ) and @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) anyon models whose monodromies only differ by an overall phase factor , @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "we observe that for ( ii ) there is a small region around @xmath153 and for ( iii ) there is a wider region , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 .",

    "parametrization ( iii ) also has a region @xmath158 where @xmath159 with error @xmath160 .",

    "further , we check for all parametrizations and all @xmath117 that @xmath161 with error less than @xmath162 , that for @xmath163 the holonomy vanishes and that @xmath164 when the direction of braiding is reversed .",
    "since our calculation involves only the experimentally accessible parameters @xmath165 and @xmath117 , it translates directly to how one could physically implement the creation and transport of anyons in the laboratory .",
    "in particular , in the optical lattice proposal of micheli et al .",
    "@xcite , the vortex transport would correspond , given sufficient site addressability , to the local adiabatic inversion of magnetic field as well as of the couplings @xmath165 through the introduction of suitably tuned lasers . also , as the energy of the system is known to depend on the zero mode populations  @xcite , the effect of braiding can be detected through spectral means . as the monodromy swaps these populations between the vortex pairs , the energy behavior of the system will be different when the vortices from a single pair are brought close together before and after the braiding . detecting this energy shift reveals the non - abelian statistics .    by evaluating the holonomy",
    ", we were able to identify a range of the model s parameters where the simulation approximates well the exact time evolution of a physical system and where the statistics corresponds to the ising anyons .",
    "as expected , larger systems exhibit the predicted statistics with higher fidelity .",
    "the required magnitude of @xmath117 , however , is larger than anticipated ( @xmath166 for parametrization ( iii ) ) . in the original work @xcite",
    ", the three - body term appears in third order perturbation theory when one considers a general zeeman term ( @xmath167 ) as a perturbation . in our normalization",
    "the expansion is valid when @xmath168 . since @xmath169 , for @xmath170 one can estimate @xmath171 , which clearly does not satisfy the criteria .",
    "therefore , in order to introduce the three - body terms into the hamiltonian perturbatively , such as by adding a small magnetic field in the optical lattice proposal @xcite , one needs to consider larger systems . on the other hand , were the three - body terms engineered @xcite , our calculation provides exact predictions for braiding experiments in such systems .",
    "in summary , we formulated a method to directly study non - abelian statistics in exactly solvable lattice models whose ground state admits representation as a slater determinant . by applying it to kitaev s model",
    ", we identified finite regions of the couplings , where the non - abelian statistics corresponds to ising anyons .",
    "this confirms the previous conjectures for the presence of a non - abelian topological phase . finally , we proposed a scheme for the implementation and detection of non - abelian statistics in the laboratory .",
    "such an experiment would be an important step towards the physical realization of topological quantum computation .",
    "it is an interesting topic for future research to study whether the holonomy can be used as an order parameter for the topological phase when the system is subject to perturbations .",
