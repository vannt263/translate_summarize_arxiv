    "@xcite proposed a new class of quantum heuristic algorithms , the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ( qaoa ) .",
    "we present a novel algorithm for grover s unstructured search problem @xcite inspired by qaoa  @xcite , demonstrating the breadth of the qaoa framework .",
    "this algorithm is the first within the qaoa framework to show a quantum advantage for a number of iterations in the intermediate range between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we also introduce a novel tool , a representation based on spin coherent states , for the design and analysis of the qaoa - type circuits . using this tool",
    ", we prove a @xmath5 query complexity for our algorithm .",
    "the algorithm has the advantage of requiring fewer @xmath6-qubit gates than grover s original algorithm , because we use the transverse field in place of grover s original diffusion operator . with increasing number of iterations",
    "@xmath7 , exhaustive search of the qaoa parameters often becomes inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality .",
    "our method avoids this difficulty by restricting the parameters to be periodic .",
    "the approach suggests a potential route for parameter optimization for qaoa - based quantum heuristic algorithms more generally .",
    "in our algorithm , mixing and problem ( oracle ) hamiltonians are applied to the system in a sequence that is periodic in time .",
    "the long - time dynamics of a periodically driven quantum system can be profoundly different from a time - homogeneous one  @xcite . to analyze the outcome after @xmath5 periods",
    ", we solve the relevant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the composite ( effective ) unitary in a single period to exponential precision @xmath8 .",
    "this analysis gives further evidence that , while the initial motivation for farhi _ et al .",
    "_ s design of qaoa circuits may have come from trotterization of adiabatic quantum optimization ( aqo ) , the analysis required to understand qaoa circuits involves a very different process from estimating an exponentially small energy gap of a hamiltonian .",
    "instead , the intuition for this algorithm comes from a novel phase - space representation based on spin - coherent states in which both the unitaries generated by the mixing and the oracle hamiltonians take simple forms .",
    "we find that the composite unitary generates a closed transition between two states that have high degrees of overlap with the initial state and the target state , respectively .",
    "the transition rate in our algorithm is of order @xmath0 , and the overlaps are of order @xmath1 , yielding a nearly optimal query complexity of @xmath2 .",

    "the most straightforward application of this picture results in a query complexity that is close to optimal , up to a polylog factor .",

    "qaoa circuits iteratively alternate between a classical hamiltonian ( usually the problem hamiltonian derived from a cost function ) and a mixing term ( often the transverse field )  @xcite .",

    "proposed these circuits to tackle approximate optimization of challenging combinatorial problems , with the approximation ratio improving ( or at least not decreasing ) as the number of iterations @xmath7 increases .",
    "we will refer to circuits with the above structure as qaoa circuits whether or not they are used for approximate optimization or for some other purpose . since farhi _",
    "_ s original work , qaoa circuits have also been applied for exact optimization @xcite and sampling @xcite .",
    "further , farhi and harrow  @xcite argued , under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions , that it is not possible for any classical algorithm to produce samples according to the output distribution of qaoa circuits with even a single iteration ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "their results suggest that qaoa circuits applied to sampling are among the most promising candidates for early demonstrations of `` quantum supremacy ''  @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question whether qaoa circuits provide a quantum advantage for approximate optimization .",
    "trotterization of adiabatic quantum optimization ( aqo ) implies that qaoa can always achieve the optimum in the limit of infinite iterations ( @xmath4 ) . at the other end of the spectrum ,",
    "farhi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that a qaoa circuit with @xmath9 beat the best classical approximation ratio for maxe3lin2 at the time ( which inspired a new classical approach that currently hold the record ) .",
    "the parameters for these circuits are the times @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , for which the mixing and classical hamiltonian , respectively , are applied .",
    "_  show that , for a fixed @xmath7 , the optimal parameters can be computed in time polynomial in the number of qubits @xmath13 .",
    "if we discretize so that each parameter can take on @xmath14 values , exhaustive search of the optimum takes exponential steps in @xmath7 as @xmath15 .    for this reason ,",
    "prior to this work , there were no results for qaoa circuits with an intermediate number of iterations @xmath16 . here , we give the first such algorithm .",
    "our approach suggests that considering qaoa circuits with periodic parameters may be a profitable way to parameter setting for qaoa circuits with @xmath16 .",
    "grover s algorithm  @xcite has attracted much attention , because it has been proven that it outperforms any classical algorithm .",
    "it searches for a needle in a haystack , achieving a query complexity of @xmath5 , where @xmath17 is the size of the search space .",
    "grover s algorithm is optimal among quantum algorithms for such a task  @xcite .",
    "it offers a modest quadratic speedup over any classical counterpart , though even quadratic speedup is considerable when @xmath18 is large .",
    "grover s algorithm selectively alters the phase of the target state given by the oracle , at each iteration .",
    "while this operation on its own would not change the probability of reading out the target state , it sets the stage for the next operation which takes advantage of the phase difference to increase the probability of the system being in that state .",
    "this effect would be impossible were quantum amplitudes not able to store phase information as well as the probability .",
    "this step is carried out by grover s diffusion operator , which applies a phase of @xmath19 to the even superposition state and does nothing to any state orthogonal to it .",
    "it requires @xmath20 two - qubit gates to implement grover s diffusion operator  @xcite .",
    "grover s unstructured search problem can also be solved by adiabatic quantum computation , where a mixing hamiltonian ( typically a transverse field ) is gradually replaced by the problem hamiltonian that encodes the answer in its ground state .",
    "the minimum gap of the total hamiltonian is crucial to the time complexity of the algorithm and was first given by farhi _",
    "et al . _",
    "recently , the exponential scaling of this minimum gap was rederived using an instanton approach , without solving the eigenvalue equation ( see supplementary material in  @xcite ) . by adjusting the evolution rate of the hamiltonian ,",
    "roland and cerf  @xcite recover the quadratic advantage of grover s original algorithm over classical search .",
    "roland and cerf do not use the standard mixing operator , the transverse field , but rather a hamiltonian related to grover s diffusion operator .",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to implement unstructured quantum search in the circuit model using the transverse field instead of grover s diffusion operator . here",
    ", we give an affirmative answer to this question .",

    "@xcite , we present a circuit - based quantum algorithm to search for a needle in a haystack . we show that grover s diffusion operator can be replaced by the transverse field , which only requires single - qubit gates , without sacrificing the quadratic quantum speedup . as single - qubit gates can usually be carried out much more efficiently than multi - qubit gates in practice , our algorithm offers a mild implementation advantage for grover s unstructured search and its variants .",
    "this circuit model approach can take advantage of fault - tolerant error - correcting schemes ; it is not known how , and could be impossible , to achieve fault tolerance in a purely adiabatic model  @xcite .",
    "we construct a simple periodic sequence of gates that induces a closed transition between two states which have large overlaps with the initial and the target states , respectively .",
    "the query complexity of our algorithm is @xmath224 , differing from the optimal value proved in  @xcite only by a constant factor of @xmath225 .",
    "our algorithm provides the first example of a qaoa circuit that exhibits a quantum advantage at an intermediate number of iterations @xmath7 , @xmath226 and the algorithm is not derived from trotterization of an aqo algorithm , demonstrating the breadth of the qaoa framework .",
    "it remains an open question whether qaoa circuits provide a quantum advantage for approximate optimization .",
    "it is generally hard to find the optimal parameters in the qaoa when the number of iterations of the algorithm is large .",
    "our work demonstrates that even simple periodic dynamics generated by the transverse field and the problem hamiltonian can induce interesting transitions between a problem - independent state and an approximate target state .",
    "it offers a strategy to drastically simplify the optimization of the parameters in qaoa by restricting them to be periodic . for grover s unstructured search , such simplification yields a near optimal solution to the problem",
    ". it will be interesting to see how well this strategy works for more general cases .",
    "our algorithm can be understood intuitively using a spin - coherent - state representation , where the weights of the basis states evolve in a simple way under the unitaries generated by the driver and the oracle .",
    "we also use a novel phase - space representation based on spin - coherent states to analyze the composite unitary in our algorithm . the eigenstates ( up to normalization factors ) of the composite",
    "unitary take explicit forms in this representation , and the eigenvalue equation can be readily derived using the periodic boundary condition .",
    "this enables us to solve the eigenstates and eigenvalues to exponential precision in @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth exploring the extent to which such a representation is effective for more general quantum heuristic algorithms .",
