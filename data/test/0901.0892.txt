    "in 1917 einstein tried to find a static solution of the field equations of general relativity that describes a homogeneous and isotropic universe . as static solutions , in general ,",
    "do not exist in this setting , einstein introduced the cosmological constant @xmath2 to make the solution static  @xcite .",
    "it was noted soon thereafter by eddington  @xcite that this solution is unstable with respect to homogeneous and isotropic perturbations .",
    "however , subsequent work by harrison  @xcite and gibbons  @xcite indicates that the issue is more subtle than originally thought . in particular gibbons showed that the einstein static universe maximizes the entropy for an equation of state with sound speed @xmath3 .",
    "these results have been further investigated in  @xcite where it was shown that the einstein static universe is neutrally stable against small inhomogeneous vector and tensor perturbations , and also neutrally stable against inhomogeneous adiabatic scalar density perturbations if the sound speed satisfies @xmath4 , and unstable otherwise .",
    "these results allow for the interesting scenario where the universe may have started out as an einstein static universe  @xcite , thereby allowing for a natural beginning for inflation .",
    "because of its interesting stability properties and its analytical simplicity , the einstein cosmos has always been of great interest general relativity and its extensions .",
    "these static cosmological models have been constructed in braneworld models @xcite , string theory @xcite , and loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "in addition , models with non - constant pressure have been considered @xcite .",
    "the first stability analyses of the einstein static universe in @xmath0 modified gravity can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the latter paper",
    ", it was found that stable solutions do exist which were unstable in general relativity .",
    "subsequent work on the einstein static universe in higher order gravity theories  @xcite , especially existence and stability , had led to slightly differing results .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite it was noted that that there exists only one functional form of @xmath0 that admits an einstein static universe . on the other hand , in",
    "@xcite the stability was analyzed for a model of a different type .",
    "both findings seem to be inconsistent at first glance , however , in this paper we are able to reconcile all previous results and show their consistency .",
    "( also see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the existence of einstein - static models in more general modified gravity scenarios . )",
    "although the cosmological constant was soon dismissed after its original introduction in 1917 , recent observations seem to indicate that the universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion , consistent with the presence of @xmath2 ( now called dark energy ) in the einstein field equations . the idea that dark energy may indicate the need for a gravitational theory beyond general relativity has recently inspired a vast amount of research , in what is know as modified gravity or higher order gravity .",
    "such models are not new and have been analyzed ever since the field equations have been formulated in their original form .",
    "however , it is only recently that these models are investigated in the context of alternatives to dark energy .",
    "@xmath0 models which have a viable cosmology were analyzed , and it was found that the models satisfying cosmological and local gravity constraints are practically indistinguishable from the @xmath2cdm model , at least at the background level  @xcite , for recent reviews see  @xcite . however , such models must also be consistent with cosmological structure formation , which means the study of perturbation theory in modified gravity is necessary  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relatively simple einstein static universe is an ideal test bed for perturbation theory to gain insight into the principal differences between general relativity and its modifications .",
    "we analyze the stability of the einstein static universe against homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar perturbations in the context of @xmath0 gravity . in the following section we discuss the existence of the einstein static universe as a solution of the cosmological field equations for two types of models , fine - tuned and non - fined - tuned models and make connections with previous work . in ",
    "[ sec : scalar perturbations ] we analyze the perturbations about the einstein static universe .",
    "the perturbations can be characterized by two parameters , namely the equation of state @xmath5 and a parameter @xmath6 which depends on the form of @xmath0 and the matter density .",
    "we discuss our results in the final  [ disc ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider modified gravity models governed by the action @xmath7.\\ ] ] here , @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the lagrangian density of matter , and @xmath10 .",
    "the field equations associated with this action are well known : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and we use a prime to denote derivatives of functions with respect to their arguments ; i.e. , @xmath13 . note that the ricci scalar depends on the second derivatives of the metric , so the last term on the right - hand side of ( [ field eqn ] ) involves fourth - order derivatives of @xmath14 . the trace of eq .",
    "( [ field eqn ] ) gives @xmath15 this gives a ( possibly nonlinear ) dynamical equation for the ricci scalar sourced by the trace of the stress energy tensor .",
    "the existence of such an equation means that instead of regarding ( [ field eqn ] ) as a fourth order equation for @xmath14 , we can regard ( [ field eqn ] ) and ( [ trace field eqn ] ) as a system of coupled second order equations for @xmath14 and @xmath8 .",
    "this observation is the basis for the treatment of @xmath0 gravity as a particular type of scalar - tensor theory , see e.g.  @xcite .      to find an einstein static solution of the field equations  ( [ field eqn ] )",
    ", we adopt the metric ansatz @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the metric on the 3-sphere @xmath18 we also assume that the matter content of the model is a single perfect fluid @xmath19 in these , @xmath5 is the constant equation of state parameter and @xmath20 is the constant radius of the universe .",
    "we have selected the spacetime coordinates @xmath21 to be dimensionless . putting these assumptions into the @xmath0 field equations yields that the ricci scalar is equal to a constant @xmath22 fixed by the radius @xmath23 and that the values of @xmath24 and its first derivative at @xmath25 are @xmath26 note that this can be rewritten as @xmath27 in other words ,",
    "if we view the equation of state parameter @xmath5 as fixed , then any @xmath0 model that satisfies ( [ es condition ] ) for one _ particular _ value of the curvature @xmath25 admits an einstein static solution  @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath28 is some mass scale the choice @xmath29\\ ] ] does not admit an einstein static solution unless the curvature is fine - tuned to @xmath30 .",
    "general relativity with a cosmological constant @xmath2 can be recast as an @xmath0 model with @xmath31 in this case , we have an einstein - static solution for @xmath32 if the equation of state parameter and cosmological constant are given , these equations determine @xmath22 and @xmath33 uniquely ; i.e. , in order to have a static configuration in general relativity the radius of the universe must be fine - tuned . from this",
    "it follows that any fluctuations in the universe s radius away from this fined - tuned value will result in time - dependent cosmologies , which is what we will see in  [ sec : scalar perturbations ] .",
    "it is possible to construct @xmath0 models such that one can find einstein static solutions for any choice of the radius @xmath20 , or conversely the curvature @xmath22 . to find these models , we regard ( [ es condition ] ) as an ordinary differential equation that holds for all curvature .",
    "the solution is @xmath34 where the mass scale @xmath28 is an integration constant .",
    "@xcite have previously considered this case and claimed that this choice of @xmath0 is the only one that admits einstein static solutions .",
    "this statement is perhaps misleading : ( [ eq : self - similar f(r ) ] ) is the only @xmath0 model that allows for einstein static solutions of arbitrary radius . in other words , one does not need to fine - tune the radius or curvature in these models to have an einstein static solution , which is quite different from the general relativity case above  @xcite .",
    "we will see in  [ sec : non - fine - tuned perts ] that the spectrum of homogeneous linear perturbations of this model admit static solutions , which is not possible when @xmath35 .",
    "we consider fluctuations of the background geometry and matter content parameterized by @xmath36 where the metric fluctuation is understood to be small @xmath37 .",

    ", it follows that the perturbation of the ricci scalar is @xmath42 where @xmath43 . note how we have defined the scalar quantity @xmath44 to be precisely the variation of @xmath8 . finally , we have the linear variations in @xmath24 and @xmath45:@xmath46    we now linearize the @xmath0 field equation ( [ field eqn ] ) about the background solution @xmath47 where @xmath48 \\nabla_m f_0 ' \\right .      \\\\ \\left .",

    "notice that they are presented as a pair of second order linear equations for @xmath52 and @xmath44 respectively . using the basic definition of @xmath44 ( [ phi definition ] ) , it is possible to combine these two equations into a single fourth order equation for @xmath52 which reflects the fourth order nature of the @xmath0 field equations .",
    "the einstein static solution has constant ricci curvature , which implies that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath53 are independent of spacetime position .",
    "that is , all gradients of these quantities vanish in equations ( [ graviton equation ] ) and ( [ scalar equation ] ) .",
    "these then simplify to @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 notice that these equations also govern perturbations about locally de sitter or anti - de sitter solutions in arbitrary @xmath0 models .",
    "( equations of motion for perturbations of de sitter backgrounds were first derived in @xcite . )      working in the longitudinal gauge , we can write scalar perturbations of the model as    [ scalar ansatz ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the spatial projection tensor and derivative , respectively : @xmath60 in this gauge , the perturbed metric reads @xmath61.\\ ] ] from this , it follows that @xmath62 represents the perturbation to the newtonian potential and @xmath63 represents the perturbation to the spatial curvature . in the matter sector , @xmath64 is related to the perturbation in the fluid s 4-velocity and the density and pressure perturbations are rewritten as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the relative density perturbation and we have used that the sound speed @xmath67 for a single perfect fluid .    it is useful to perform a harmonic decomposition of these scalar potentials and the perturbation to the ricci scalar @xmath44 : @xmath68 in these expressions , summation over @xmath69 is understood .",
    "the harmonic function @xmath70 satisfies @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the laplacian operator on the 3-dimensional spatial sections of the model ( i.e. , associated with @xmath17 ) .    putting ( [ scalar ansatz ] ) into ( [ graviton equation 2 ] ) and ( [ scalar equation 2 ] ) and performing some algebra , we find that @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are expressible in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath78}{2(1 - 3w ) f_0      f_0'},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have used an overdot to denote derivatives with respect to @xmath79 ; i.e. , @xmath80 .",

    "explicitly , the frequencies are given by @xmath91 where    @xmath92    obviously , we will have unstable perturbation modes if either @xmath93 or @xmath94 are nonzero .",
    "this leads to the following _ stability _ criteria : @xmath95 in other words , if the above conditions are met for a given choice of @xmath96 , the associated perturbations will be stable",
    ". it should be stress that the stability of a particular einstein static model is completely determined by @xmath5 , @xmath97 and the value of @xmath0 and its first and second derivatives _",
    "evaluated on the background solution_. that is , it is not necessary to know the full functional form of @xmath0 to determine the behavior of perturbations , we just need know about the first few terms of the taylor expansion of @xmath0 about the background curvature .",
    "notice that since @xmath98 for @xmath35 , the scalar mass @xmath99 in the gr limit .",
    "the corresponding limits for the frequencies ( [ eq : frequencies ] ) are @xmath100 the second of these matches the results of @xcite",
    ". the first frequencies are formally infinite , and represent an artifact of the reduction of fourth - order to second - order gravity .",
    "the second set of frequencies implies that the model is stable for all @xmath101 .      in the case of homogeneous perturbations we set @xmath102 in the above expressions .",
    "we then find that einstein - static solutions will be stable in two distinct regions of parameter space .",
    "the first we call the `` normal region '' : @xmath103 the term normal comes from the fact that the this region has @xmath104 $ ] , so the matter sound speed is sub - luminal .",
    "the other stability region is called the `` phantom region '' , and is given by : @xmath105 the stable models in this region have @xmath106 which implies a superluminal sound speed , hence the term `` phantom '' . also , the fact that @xmath107 implies that either the scalar mass @xmath50 is imaginary , or the density of matter @xmath33 is negative . moreover , the effective gravitational coupling constant is also negative . in either possibility ,",
    "models in the phantom region are quite strange and we are led to conclude that these models should be regarded as unphysical .",

    "we also show the general relativity stability region as inferred from  ( [ eq : gr frequencies ] ) .",
    "the key feature of this plot is that all models with equations of state @xmath110 are unstable with respect to homogeneous perturbations .",
    "we now turn our attention to the behavior of inhomogeneous perturbations @xmath111 . recall that the spherical symmetry of the 3-dimensional spatial sections of the model dictates that the value of the wavenumber is discrete @xmath112 .",
    "note that as in general relativity , the @xmath113 mode corresponds to a gauge degree of freedom related to a global rotation . for the @xmath114 modes ,",
    "we find that the model is stable for @xmath115 lying within two regions :    [ eq : inhomogeneous stability criteria ] @xmath116    where    @xmath117    and @xmath118.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    in figure [ fig : k = sqrt(8 ) ] we show the lefthand and righthand stability regions for the largest wavelength ( non - gauge ) inhomogeneous perturbations @xmath119 . as in figure [ fig : k=0 ] , we also show the relevant stability condition for general relativity .     parameter space for @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) perturbations of einstein static universes .",
    "note that all models with @xmath121 are unstable with respect to these types of perturbations . ]    from figure [ fig : k = sqrt(8 ) ] , we see that all models with @xmath122 are unstable to @xmath123 perturbations .",
    "it is not hard to confirm that this it true for all @xmath114 perturbations .",
    "it is clear that the stability regions in figures [ fig : k=0 ] and [ fig : k = sqrt(8 ) ] do not overlap . from this",
    "we can conclude that it is impossible to construct an einstein static universe in @xmath0 gravity that is stable with respect to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations , which is the main conclusion of this paper .",
    "as an example of the general results we have derived , we examine the non - fine - tuned models of  [ sec : non - fine - tuned ] .",
    "using the specific form of @xmath0 given in ( [ eq : self - similar f(r ) ] ) , we can easily obtain @xmath6 as a function of @xmath5 for these models : @xmath124 for the homogeneous ( @xmath108 ) perturbations , this leads to the following frequencies : @xmath125.\\ ] ] it is clear that for any choice of @xmath5 , one of these frequencies is zero and the other is nonzero .",
    "this means we can always find static and homogeneous perturbations of these models .",
    "recall that the unique feature of the non - fine - tuned scenario is that there exists einstein static solutions for all radii @xmath20 .",
    "hence , these static solutions are easy to understand : they represent the deformation of one einstein static solution into another one with a different radius .",
    "we can also see that the non - zero frequency will be real only for @xmath126 $ ] ; i.e. , the @xmath108 perturbations will be stable when @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "when the particular form of @xmath6 in ( [ eq : alpha non - fine - tuned ] ) is inserted into the inhomogeneous stability criteria ( [ eq : inhomogeneous stability criteria ] ) , we find that all @xmath114 perturbations will be stable if @xmath127 this reproduces the result of  @xcite , and hence provides a nice verification of our general formulae .",
    "in this paper we showed that one can not construct an @xmath0 modified gravity theory such that an einstein static universe is stable with respect to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar perturbations .",
    "our results and general formulae are valid for any generic form of the function @xmath0 .",
    "our approach allows us to verify results previously derived based on specific forms of @xmath0 , see  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we were able to reconcile the results of  @xcite and  @xcite , which at first glance seem to be contradictory .",
    "our results show explicitly that perturbation theory of modified gravity theories shows a much richer stability/ instability structure than general relativity .",
    "this due to the fundamentally fourth order nature of the theory , as evidenced by the @xmath128 matrix equation of motion ( [ scalar equations ] ) for scalar perturbations .",
    "this should be compared to the equation of motion in general relativity ( as in @xcite , for example ) , which is just a single second - order ode . in case of homogeneous perturbation we found a region in the parameter space where the equation of state is in the phantom regime @xmath106 ,",
    "see the phantom stable region of fig .",
    "[ fig : k=0 ] .",
    "it is unclear how this stability region can be interpreted from a physical point of view .",
    "finally , we would like to point out how the formulae and techniques in this paper can be applied to other situations .",
    "we note that the equations of  [ sec : general eoms ] can be applied to any @xmath0 background solution .",
    "the formulae of  [ sec : constant curvature eoms ] can be used for any constant curvature solution of the modified gravity field equations ; i.e. , they could be used to address the stability of black hole solutions of the modified field equations .",
    "our method of determining stability criteria entirely in terms of the background values of @xmath24 and its first and second derivatives is applicable beyond the einstein static solution .",
    "indeed , it can be an efficient method of analyzing perturbations of given constant curvature spacetime in the entire space of @xmath0 models ."
