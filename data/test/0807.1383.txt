    "getting back to the spirit of the xix@xmath0 century  when purely mechanical models were ubiquitous even for understanding systems involving electromagnetic fields  this paper discusses a simple model of an oscillator coupled to a string that presents a host of interesting features in a very accessible way .",
    "it will be presented in detail in    [ sec : model ] ( see figure  [ fig : cordosc ] ) . even though the required technical background is on an upper undergraduate / early graduate level ,",
    "if one remains within a classical ( _ i.e. _ non - quantum ) context , this model encapsulates many relevant features of physical interest which can be found in more realistic models , for instance when considering the interaction of an atom ( the oscillator ) with light ( the string ) .",
    "first (   [ sec : scattering ] ) , when the string is infinite , it allows one to gain insight into ( or to discover for the first time in academic studies ) the scattering of waves by a dynamical system .",
    "it provides the opportunity to introduce some of the ingredients of scattering theory : when dealing with a one - dimensional mechanical system , the notion of asymptotic states ( the so - called `` in '' and `` out '' states ) is made as simple as possible and the @xmath1 matrix takes a particular simple form . unlike the transmission of light in a fabry - perot interferometer , the resonant scattering appears here explicitly in connection with the familiar resonance phenomenon of a forced oscillator and we can also understand how the motion of the oscillator affects in return the external excitation .",
    "second (   [ sec : radiation ] ) , from the point of view of the oscillator , this model constitutes the most elementary example of radiation .",
    "it shows concretely how an interaction not only induces a shift in the natural frequency of the oscillator ( this can already be seen when only two degrees of freedom are coupled ) but also that the coupling to a large number of degrees of freedom ( the string being seen as a large collection of oscillators ) induces a friction term for the oscillator , although no dissipation exists in the system as a whole .",
    "indeed , as far as i know , there are very few places where this model is discussed and always in the specialised literature with a dalembert string @xcite .",
    "some of its variants @xcite are introduced precisely for studying dissipation at a quantum level .",
    "as we will see , a klein - gordon string allows to keep one discrete mode ( a bounded state ) without dissolving it in the continuous spectrum of the string and therefore allows to mimic the interaction of a field with a stable particle , not just a metastable one .",
    "this model is particularly relevant to see how backreaction works : for instance , for a dalembert string , the oscillator is governed by an abraham - lorentz - dirac - like equation . besides",
    ", we will be able to illustrate precisely the deep connection between the resonance and the poles of the @xmath1 matrix ( a major feature in high energy particle physics and in condensed matter physics ) .    before we give some guidelines for further developments in the conclusion (   [ sec : conclusion ] ) , we will complete our classical study in ",

    "then , the scattering is the most efficient since no transmission occur ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) .",
    "the resonance spike can be seen in figure  [ fig : rhotau ] and its quality factor can be evaluated from its width  @xmath145 when  @xmath146 : for a small coupling , @xmath147 and therefore , the smaller  @xmath9 , the better the quality of the resonance .",
    "the general idea that damping and therefore irreversibility emerge because of the interaction with a large number of degrees of freedom can be illustrated explicitly on our model .",
    "if we choose initial conditions such that the spring is at rest at @xmath148 , the entire energy being contained in the oscillator , for instance @xmath149 the energy transfer to the string will damp the oscillations of  @xmath7 and the latter may completely lose its energy far before the energy can get back from the string if its boundary is far away from the oscillator ( for a string of length  @xmath150 , poincar recurrence time is of order @xmath151 if there were no dispersion ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the oscillator is particularly simple when the string is non - dispersive ( @xmath152 ) and therefore we will start by studying this case .",
    "however , we will also consider the case of the klein - gordon string because when  @xmath153 , we will see that there exists a stable mode of the oscillator at a frequency  @xmath154 whose dissipation is blocked because  @xmath155 .",

    "equation   becomes @xmath157 and the elimination of  @xmath158 from   and yields to @xmath159 the two terms in the right hand side are dissipative forces .",
    "the first one has the familiar taste of the viscous resistive force whereas the second has the flavour of the schott term  @xmath160 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 2.7b ) ) in the abraham - lorentz - dirac equation which governs the dynamics of an electric charge  @xmath161 that takes into account the electromagnetic self - force of the charge .",
    "the major difference is the sign of the coefficient in front of the third - derivative . unlike the schott term ,",
    "the negative sign in   prevents the spurious exponentially accelerating solutions .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the irreversibility due to dissipation comes straightforwardly from the choice of initial conditions that break the time - reversal symmetry under which the original equations are invariant .",
    "many models of an oscillator coupled to one - dimensional waves are recovered in the limit of strong coupling  @xmath162 ( see the references given in the introduction , for instance when the mass is directly attached on the string ) . in that case , only the viscous force remains in   and we immediately get the well - known damped oscillator @xmath163 .    looking for exponential solutions  @xmath164 yields to the characteristic equation of  : @xmath165",

    "in addition to a more detailed study of the finite size effects , another natural development of the present work would be to deal with multiple scatterers .",
    "for instance , when there are two identical scatterers with  @xmath153 , we expect that the degeneracies of the two bounded modes is broken and that the splitting between the symmetric and the antisymmetric bounded modes decreases exponentially with the separation of the oscillators . starting with initial conditions where only one oscillator has some energy , the beating between the two oscillators is an example of tunnelling due to the presence of evanescent waves connecting the two oscillators",
    ".    even before we quantize the whole system , our model may be interesting to keep the field classical whereas only the oscillator is quantized .",
    "it would provide an illustration of say , the fermi golden rule within the context of time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however , we have proven that this golden rule transpires in our classical model since the transition rate   to the continuum of the modes is proportionnal to the square of the coupling strength  @xmath9 to first order in the perturbation .",
