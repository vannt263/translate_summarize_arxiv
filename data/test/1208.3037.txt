    "vesicle dynamics has long been investigated both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",

    "the external perturbation , be it thermal , electrical , sonication  @xcite , or flow  @xcite , transforms the lamellar structure into the vesicles .",
    "in such situation , one often obtains mixture of uni - lamellar vesicle and multi - lamellar vesicles ( mlv ) of various sizes .",
    "however , in sharp contrast with the very detailed calculations and scattering experiments on the unilamellar vesicles , there are relatively few studies of the mlv dynamics in the literature . in this paper , we consider the two - bilayer vesicle which is the simplest mlv .",
    "we calculate the dynamic relaxation rates , as well as the rheological response of the two - layer - vesicles . from the experimental point of view , it is hard to prepare vesicles with exactly two bilayers .",
    "nonetheless , such a concrete calculation provides a clear picture of how the interaction between the two membranes affect the relaxation rates , as well as the squeezing ( lubrication ) flow which arises exclusively in mlv .",
    "since our method can be extend to vesicles with more than two bilayers , a more specific calculation can be performed similarly .",
    "the squeezing dynamics of the sandwiched solvent between the two layers have been analyzed in two related problems .",

    ", the `` squeezing mode '' dispersion has been calculated and measured @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we obtain the similar relaxation in which the solvent is squeezed between the two adjacent bilayers to relax the bilayer curvature energy and the mutual interaction energy between the two bilayers . as this mode arises only in mlv , we are interested in its dispersion relation and its coupling strength with the applied shear . due to the strong lubrication resistance ,",
    "the squeezing mode is often the slowest relaxation mode .",
    "this makes the squeezing mode an important candidate for the vesicle rheology .",
    "however , not every relaxation mode is equally excited by the applied shear . therefore whether the shear can drive the squeezing mode with a large amplitude is an important problem to consider . in this work",
    ", we will try to build our understanding of the coupling strength through the concrete calculation .",
    "based on the analysis below , we find that the squeezing mode makes the dominant contribution to the complex viscosity for strongly interacting bilayers .",
    "interestingly , when the gap between the two bilayers is smaller than a characteristic crossover gap , the fast undulation mode becomes the dominant mode for the complex viscosity .",
    "we find that the crossover gap gets very small when the bilayer interaction is strong . on the opposite limit where the bilayer has extremely weak interaction ,",
