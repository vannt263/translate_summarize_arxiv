    "optical spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) exhibit an extremely wide variety of properties .",
    "the emission - line regions of agn have proven to be among the most complex of all astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "agn have also been known to emit a substantial fraction of their luminosity as x - rays .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of well - defined source samples are effective in understanding the physical processes in agn . in the last decade ,",
    "several correlations between optical emission line properties and x - ray properties were noted @xcite : for instance , the strong correlations between optical fe  ii , [ o  iii]@xmath1 line strengths , velocity width of h@xmath0 and the slope of soft x - ray continuum ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these correlations received great interest previously and were expected to give important insight into the agn phenomenon .",
    "still , however , their interpretation remained unclear .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to test whether these correlations are fundamental properties or subtle selection effects , and search for new ones .",
    "clearly , a large and homogeneous x - ray selected sample would be advantageous in addressing these issues .",
    "we present such a sample here .",
    "x - ray agn samples are also of great interest for a number of other issues .",
    "agn of different types are the major contributors to the extragalactic soft and hard x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "the definitions of statistically significant agn samples using x - ray data are key to test agn number - flux relations , luminosity functions and cosmological evolution . in the course of the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) @xcite , many new agn have been identified by different teams , confirming that x - ray surveys are very efficient in finding new agn .",
    "@xcite performed an unbiased survey of all bright , @xmath3 , high galactic latitude sources in the rass without applying other selection criteria .",
    "* paper i ) identified a sample with high x - ray to optical flux ratio .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented a catalog of sources in selected areas down to the rass limit .",
    "@xcite drew a high galactic latitude sample from the rass with soft pspc spectra ( @xmath4 ) , the corresponding sample of point - like x - ray sources with relatively hard x - ray spectra ( @xmath5 ) was presented by @xcite . @xcite published a catalog of northern agn in the rass based on their schmidt plate survey .",
    "these authors presented new agn , but they did not use their samples to address correlations issues .",
    "this will be done with the present sample .    in paper",
    "i we described and presented the optical identification of a sample of 165 x - ray sources with high x - ray to optical flux ratio ( @xmath6 ) discovered in the rass .",
    "about 73% of the sources were identified as agn , including 115 emission line agn ( qsos and seyferts ) as well as 2 bl lac objects and 4 bl lac candidates . in this paper",
    "we investigate the optical emission line properties of the emission line agn that were identified as main optical counterparts of the sample and discuss their connection with x - ray properties .",
    "not included in the following discussion are the bl lac objects .    the initial identification program excluded known x - ray sources that have counterparts in the simbad , ned and agn catalogs . motivated by the need of larger and better samples ,",
    "we have cross - referenced the rass bright source catalog with the ned and agn catalogs .",
    "we find that 40 known emission line agn meet our selection criteria . , where cr and r represent x - ray count rate and r magnitude respectively ; declination @xmath7 ; galactic latitude @xmath8 ; optical counterparts within a circle with radius @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the rass position error given by voges   et   al.(1996 ) ; optical counterparts with r magnitudes between 13.5 and 16.5 .",
    "] in order to keep consistent emission line properties measurements , new optical spectra have been acquired for the 40 additional sources .",
    "these data , combined with the previous optical identifications , provide a large , bright and ( @xmath6 ) limited sample of emission line agn in the rosat x - ray band .",
    "the relatively complete sample is the largest x - ray selected agn sample with intense optical investigation so far .",
    "as described in paper  i , our classifications and identifications were based on low resolution spectra obtained with a 2.16  m telescope at xinglong station , national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) .",
    "these spectra were exposed to reach a s / n suitable for a reliable classification .",
    "the quality of the majority spectra is sufficient to measure the properties of the emission lines , such as the line widths and line strengths .",
    "for spectra with inadequate s / n , new low resolution ( @xmath1110  fwhm ) optical spectroscopy was performed using the 2.16  m telescope at naoc .",
    "all objects in our emission line agn subsample are found to be seyfert 1 type agn . throughout this paper seyfert 1",
    "galaxies and qsos will be discussed jointly , since these two classes are distinguished only by a certain luminosity level according to our classification criterion .",
    "we do not divide the seyfert 1 class into subclasses such as seyfert 1.5 - 1.9 or nls1 galaxies ( as defined by @xcite , @xcite ) , since the definitions of seyfert classifications depend on the resolution of the spectra used and the noise in the spectra @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "detailed optical measurements are given in sect .",
    "the statistical properties are investigated in sect .",
    "3 . several diagnostically important correlations that exist between emission line and continuum properties are studied .",
    "4 discusses the implications of the results , followed by a brief summary of the main conclusions of the paper .    throughout this paper , a hubble constant of @xmath12 and a deceleration parameter of @xmath13",
    "are assumed and all measured parameters are quoted for the rest frame of the source .",
    "the known sources as well as sources without high quality observations in the identification campaign were investigated during several observing runs performed from november 1998 through december 2000 .",
    "the low resolution spectra were taken with the naoc 2.16  m telescope and the omr spectrograph , using a tektronix @xmath14 ccd as detector .",
    "the grating of 300  g  mm@xmath15 was employed in order to get large wavelength coverage .",
    "all observations were made through a 2.3@xmath16 slit that produced a resolution of 10 to 11  as measured from the comparison spectra .",
    "this set - up provided similar wavelength coverage ( 3800  ",
    "8200 ) and resolution to the identification data .",
    "exposure time was generally between 1200s and 3600s depending on the brightness of the object .",
    "for a few objects , multiple exposures were performed in order to get a higher s / n spectrum .",
    "the exposures were combined prior to extraction where possible in order to help remove cosmic ray contamination . in cases when the target source moved across the ccd chip between exposures ,",
    "the data were extracted separately from each frame and then combined .",
    "the raw data were reduced following standard procedures using iraf .",
    "the ccd reductions included bias subtraction , flatfield correction and cosmic - ray removal .",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out using helium - neon - argon lamps taken at the beginning and end of each exposure . the resulting wavelength accuracy is better than 1   .",
    "the flux calibration was derived with 2 to 3 observations of kpno standard stars @xcite per night .      in many of the spectra",
    "there is a clear contribution from blends of fe  ii line emission on both the blue and red sides of the h@xmath0-[o  iii ] complex .",
    "these blends contaminate strong lines such as [ o  iii]@xmath174959,5007 , and may alter the flux and width of h@xmath0+[o  iii]@xmath174959,5007 . in order to reliably measure line parameters and to determine the strength of the fe ii emission , we have carefully removed the fe  ii multiplets following the method described by @xcite , which relies on an fe  ii template .",
    "the template used in the present work is the same as that of @xcite , namely the fe  ii lines of i  zw  1 , a bright nls1 widely known for the strong and narrow permitted fe  ii emission @xcite .",
    "the observed spectra were wavelength - shifted to the rest frame according to the redshift.@xmath185007 to be the systemic redshift as most commonly used .",
    "the redshift was derived from fitting a gaussian to the upper half of the observed [ o  iii]@xmath185007 line in each spectrum .",
    "] the whole template was broadened to the fwhm of the broad h@xmath0 line by convolving with a gaussian and scaled to match the line intensities .",
    "the best match was then searched for in the two - dimensional parameter space of line width and line strength . from each object the best - fit fe  ii spectrum",
    "was then subtracted .",
    "a successful fe  ii subtraction showed a flat continuum between the h@xmath19 and h@xmath0 and between 51005400  ( which covers the fe  ii multiplets 48 , 49 ) .",
    "the fe  ii flux was measured between the rest wavelength 4434  and 4684   as in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic property of seyfert  1 type agn is the presence of broad emission lines .",
    "the line widths and their distributions provide important information on masses of the central black holes and mass distributions .",
    "the broad balmer lines in agn exhibit a wide variety of profile shapes and a large range in width @xcite and they are often strongly asymmetric @xcite . in many cases",
    "h@xmath0 is a mixture of broad and narrow components .",
    "differences in the relative strengths of these components account for much of the diversity of broad line profiles @xcite .",
    "the fe  ii subtracted spectra were used to measure the non - fe  ii line properties . in order to isolate the broad h@xmath0 component in all spectra ,",
    "we have assumed that the emission line profiles can be represented by a single or a combination of gaussian profiles .",
    "@xcite claimed that the broad emission lines in nls1 galaxies were better fitted with lorentzian profiles than with gaussian profiles .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , the choice of gaussian or lorentzian profiles as representatives of the observed emission lines may bear no physical meaning .",
    "we performed a multiple gaussian fit in the present work for its simplicity and a direct comparison with the measurements of previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted the method described by @xcite and used the iraf package specfit to measure blended lines .",
    "as a first step we tried to fit the emission lines with a single gaussian component .",
    "it worked well for most forbidden lines , e.g. , [ o  iii]@xmath185007 .",
    "however , this simplest representation could not fit adequately the wings of h@xmath0 , although its core was nicely fitted in most of targets . in such cases , we then included one narrow component and one broad component to describe adequately the observed profile .",
    "( note that when h@xmath0 measurements were taken from the literature , many of them refer to the whole line . ) for each assumed component , a first guess of the central wavelength , the total flux , and width of that component were specified .",
    "there were two parameters for each continuum component , i.e. , the flux and the slope .",
    "initially , we constructed a narrow component with a width determined from fitting the [ o  iii ] lines . in some spectra",
    "such a guess failed to give a good fit and needed an additional component .",
    "we then left the width of the narrow component as a free parameter .",
    "it led to a nice fitting result by checking the residual , i.e. , the narrow component could be well isolated from the broad component . for h@xmath0 lines with asymmetric profile , the two gaussian components are not stationary in wavelength .",
    "the velocity shift between the broad and narrow components is defined as the shift of the broad component relative to the narrow component in units of km  s@xmath15 ( see also zheng et al 2002 ) . as an illustration , we show the decomposition in figure  1 .",
    "the observed profile is represented by a solid line , the total fit by a dashed line , the individual gaussian components by a dot - dashed line and the differences between the data and the fit ( the residual ) by the lower dotted line .",
    "the broad component is referred as h@xmath20 , and the narrow component as h@xmath21 .",
    "the fwhm h@xmath20 is what we consider as representative of the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "the instrumental resolution was determined from the fwhms of night sky spectra taken with each of the exposures and tested by comparison - lamp spectra .",
    "all quoted line widths were corrected for the instrumental resolution .",
    "the uncertainty of h@xmath0 velocity shift measurement is within 150  km  s@xmath15 . to measure line fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) ,",
    "power - law continua were fitted and subtracted from underneath the lines and the remaining line flux was integrated . for most objects ,",
    "the uncertainty of flux measurement of emission lines is about 10% to 15% .",
    "the continuum level at the position of h@xmath0 @xmath184861 was measured from the fe  ii subtracted spectra .",
    "all equivalent widths measurements in this paper refer to the continuum at that point to allow direct comparison with the measurements for other samples @xcite .",
    "the optical index @xmath22 was calculated using the continuum flux density at 4000   and 7000   in the rest frame .    for the x - ray analysis ,",
    "a single power law description was employed .",
    "this application has proven to be a fairly good approximation for agn in previous studies ( e.g. fiore et al .",
    "1994 , brinkmann & siebert 1994 , schartel et al .",
    "1996 , grupe et al .",
    "1998 ) . because of the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the rass spectra we assumed that the absorption comes from our galaxy only .",
    "the assumption usually improves the reliability of the estimation of spectral index because of the reduced number of free parameters .",
    "the x - ray spectral slope @xmath23 was estimated using the rosat hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 , which are defined as @xcite : @xmath24 @xmath25 here , a , b , c and d denote the count rate in the energy range 0.10.4 kev , 0.52.0 kev , 0.50.9 kev and 0.92.0 kev , respectively .",
    "the full optical dataset was used to define the statistical properties of the sample and explore the correlations between various observed parameters . according to paper  i , 115 sources ( about 73% of the total )",
    "were identified as new seyfert  1s and qsos , together with 40 known emission line agn that meet our sample selection criteria , the agn subsample comprises 49 `` ultrasoft '' ( @xmath26 ) sources and 106 `` normal '' objects with mean @xmath27 . in the catalog in paper  i we listed the absolute magnitude m@xmath28 and redshift @xmath29 .",
    "the distributions of the m@xmath28 values and redshift are plotted in figure  2 .",
    "as shown by these figures , the sample is dominated by moderate luminosity objects ( @xmath30 ) with an average redshift @xmath31 .",
    "table  1 lists the derived parameters .",
    "the columns list the following information : ( 2 ) redshift ; ( 3 ) fwhm of broad h@xmath0 ; ( 4 ) fwhm of narrow h@xmath0 ; ( 5 ) fwhm of [ o  iii]@xmath185007 ; ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) the local equivalent widths of h@xmath0 broad component , fe  ii and [ o  iii]@xmath185007 ; ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ratio of fluxes of [ o  iii]@xmath185007 to broad and narrow h@xmath0 ; ( 11 ) ratio of fluxes of fe  ii to broad h@xmath0 ; ( 12 ) velocity shift between h@xmath0 broad and narrow components , where a positive velocity corresponds to a redshifted broad component relative to narrow component ; ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) h@xmath0 broad and narrow components velocity shift with respect to the systemic frame , where a positive velocity indicates a redward shift with respect to systemic ; ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) spectral indices defined above ; ( 17 ) the monochromatic 250ev luminosity .    the distribution of the broad h@xmath0 line width of the objects in our emission line agn subsample shows a significantly smaller fraction ( 3% ) of objects with fwhm @xmath32 2000  km  s@xmath15 compared to another x - ray selected sample ( 18% ) @xcite . however , the fwhm measurements in @xcite refer to the full line profile and the widths of the broad components may have been underestimated . therefore , the real difference should be smaller .",
    "five out of 155 objects in our sample are nls1 galaxies without detectable broad balmer line components of fwhm @xmath33 2000  km  s@xmath15 but with strong fe  ii emission , which agrees within the error limits with that of @xcite ( about 2% ) .",
    "the distribution of the fwhm of the broad component of h@xmath0 in the sample is displayed in figure  3 .",

    "the velocity shift distribution of h@xmath34 with respect to [ o  iii]@xmath1 is shown in figure  4a .",
    "positive velocity corresponds to a redward h@xmath0 with respect to systemic , while a negative velocity represents a blueshift .",
    "the peak of this distribution is near zero , but has a mean redshift of 78  km  s@xmath15 with standard deviation of 305  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "this shift is in good agreement with the previous studies @xcite , i.e. , balmer emission lines gives the same redshift to within 100  km  s@xmath15 of narrow forbidden emission ( _ e.g. _ [ o  iii]@xmath185007 ) in low redshift ( @xmath35 ) qsos and seyfert galaxies .",
    "in contrast , a systematic mean redward shift of 520  km  s@xmath15 was found for a high redshift ( @xmath36 ) qsos sample @xcite .",

    "we can see from the figures that the dispersion of the h@xmath21  [ o  iii]@xmath1 shift is significantly narrower than the h@xmath34  [ o  iii]@xmath1 shift , which is expected by the different emitting regions between h@xmath0 broad component and narrow component , as well as [ o  iii]@xmath1 .    in a similar manner to the h@xmath34 ",
    "[ o  iii]@xmath1 shift , figure  4c illustrates the velocity differences between the broad and narrow components of h@xmath0 .",

    "positive velocities refer to redshifts with respect to the narrow component velocities , whereas negative velocities indicate blueshifts .",
    "we emphasis that both the h@xmath0 redshift ( or blueshift ) in the present work and the asymmetry parameter in @xcite are measures for line profile , but characterized differently .",
    "the latter is a measure of the shift between the centroids at @xmath37 and @xmath38 maximum .",

    "correlation analyses involving the line profiles of h@xmath0 are investigated in section 3.3 .      in this subsection",
    ", we explore whether the various emission - line and continuum properties correlate with one another . for this purpose , we calculated the spearman rank - order correlation matrix @xcite , along with its significance matrix for measured properties .",

    "a set of 12 different properties results in @xmath41 correlation coefficients ; therefore , at this level of significance , we would expect @xmath42 spurious events .    among 66 trials ,",
    "31 correlations ( both positive and negative ) are found with two - sided probabilities @xmath40 .",
    "four are due to the dependent parameters , e.g. , relative strength of fe  ii to h@xmath0 and fe  ii  ew ; 12 are degenerate correlations , i.e. , different measures of the same property ( e.g. , [ o  iii ]  ew , [ o  iii]/h@xmath34 and [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 ) all correlate with another property ( e.g. , fe  ii  ew ) ; and therefore 15 are independent correlations at the @xmath43 confidence level .    the well - known anti - correlation between the x - ray spectral slope @xmath44 and the fwhm of h@xmath0 @xcite is not prominent in our sample ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) as is the case in the @xcite sample ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the relation between h@xmath0 width and @xmath44 is not a linear correlation , but probably resulted from a `` zone of avoidance '' @xcite , i.e. , broad line objects always tend to show flat x - ray spectra , whereas there is a very large scatter in the x - ray spectral steepness of nls1 galaxies , with several as flat as normal seyfert 1s ( xu et al .",

    "the lack of correlation between the line width and fe  ii strength ( when measured independently with h@xmath0 ) in @xcite , @xcite and the present work has confirmed that the anti - correlation arises because h@xmath0 gets weaker as the lines get narrower @xcite .",
    "in addition to our confirmation of well documented correlations between different agn properties , we report on three newly discovered correlations involving the h@xmath0 redshift ( or blueshift ) , flux ratios of fe  ii to h@xmath0 broad component ( fe  ii / h@xmath34 ) and [ o  iii ] to h@xmath0 narrow component ( [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 ) .",

    "there is a trend that strong fe  ii / h@xmath34weak [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 objects tend to have blueshifts in h@xmath0 while strong [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 weak fe  ii / h@xmath34 objects tend to have redshifts in h@xmath0 . these strong correlations between fe  ii / h@xmath34 , h@xmath0 redshift and [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 must reflect some physical connection between broad and narrow line emitting regions .",
    "one key to understand the central engines of agn lies in examining their local environment .",
    "the standard paradigm proposes that the surrounding gas is photoionized in physically distinct regions by radiation emerging from the central power source@xcite .",
    "however , the segregation of the ionized gas into broad - line region ( blr ) and narrow - line region ( nlr ) , as well as the details of the gas kinematics are still far from clear .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the ionized gas around galactic nuclei provides strong constraints on the excitation mechanisms .",
    "the following discussion addresses three key points : ( 1 ) how do the present results compare to previous work ; ( 2 ) which new correlations do we find and how can we understand them ; and ( 3 ) which future observations can we perform to distinguish between different suggested scenarios .    a number of consistent correlations among observational parameters have been searched in order to understand the basic properties underlying the observed spectra . in particular , @xcite made a landmark study of the optical emission - line properties and continuum properties ( radio through x - ray ) of 87 low redshift pg quasars .",
    "a principal component analysis revealed `` eigenvector  1 '' ( ev1 ) links stronger fe  ii emission , weaker [ o  iii ] emission from the nlr , and narrower h@xmath0 ( blr ) with stronger line blue asymmetry .",
    "more recently , @xcite found these optical properties also go along with steeper soft x - ray spectra and claimed the soft x - ray slope as a related part of ev1 .",
    "we confirm these trends and present in addition three newly discovered correlations involving the h@xmath0 redshift , fe  ii / h@xmath34 and [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 .",
    "potentially , ev1 represents a fundamental physical driver that control the energy producing and radiation emitting processes .",
    "the two leading interpretations by far are that ev1 is driven by ( 1 ) the eddington ratio @xmath59 @xcite and ( 2 ) orientation effect .",
    "@xcite argued strongly that viewing angle is unlikely to drive ev1 , by assuming [ o  iii ] emission is isotropic , originating from radii large enough to be free from orientation dependent obscuration .",
    "the isotropy of [ o  iii ] emission has been questioned by the studies of radio - loud agn @xcite .",
    "however , a recent study of radio - quiet quasars @xcite showed a significant correlation between ev1 and orientation independent [ o  ii ] emission , which implied that ev1 is not driven by orientation .",
    "moreover , the correlation between [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission indicated [ o  iii ] emission is not dependent on orientation .",
    "the most promising interpretation at present is that ev1 is mostly governed by @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this suggestion was based on the notion that the vertical thickness of the accretion disk , driven by the eddington ratio , controls the line strengths and continuum parameters .",
    "the striking correlations between the h@xmath0 redshift , fe  ii / h@xmath34 and [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 found in the present work give us linkages of the gas kinematics and ionization between blr and nlr .",
    "the question raised is what is the physical process behind the correlations ? can both the new and previous correlations be explained within one single scenario ?",
    "indeed , the @xmath59 interpretation provides plausible explanations for the observed trends .",
    "one of the two general scenarios in agn to explain asymmetric profile is in terms of an outflowing component in the blr with a change in obscuration by a central disk of clouds on the receding side .",
    "accreting systems in high @xmath59 agn will drive relatively thick outflows due to their larger photon luminosities per unit gravitational mass .",
    "as the velocity of the outflow increases , the h@xmath0 develops an increasing excess on the blue wing . the corresponding blue h@xmath34 velocity shift in comparison with [ o  iii ]",
    "can be also well predicted because both the line asymmetry and the shift of the line centroids are effects of the same process .",
    "the link between blr and nlr in terms of density is less straight forward to predict .",
    "e.g. , due to the strong outflow , the nlr might be replaced by denser clouds . given a typical radial distribution of nlr clouds , [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 peaks around densities of @xmath60 = 24 ( e.g. , komossa & schulz 1997 ) .",
    "high - density nlr clouds would therefore lead to a suppression of [ o  iii ] strength .",
    "the same is true for the other limit , a low - density nlr .",
    "some authors favored a low - density blr of nls1 galaxies ( see , e.g. , the discussion in rodriguez - pascual et al .",
    "1997 and komossa & mathur 2001 ) , which may indicate a low - density nlr as well , if both regions are coupled . the best way to measure directly the density of the nlr of nls1s in the future is to employ the density - sensitive line ratios [ o  ii]@xmath183729/[o  ii]@xmath183726 or [ s  ii]@xmath186716/[s  ii]@xmath186731 . these ratios are presently generally not reported in the literature .",
    "their measurements requires high s / n spectroscopy and/or resolution to detect and resolve these lines .-",
    "ratio measured by @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath61 2.8 and does not deviate significantly from the values found for , e.g. , seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",
    "however , ngc 4051 is not an extreme nls1 in terms of x - ray steepness and fe  ii emission . ] more indirectly , other line - ratios will also change in dependence of density and thus allow a density determination .",
    "for instance , a higher - density nlr would strongly boost the [ o  i]@xmath186300 line @xcite .    although it is more difficult to illustrate the direct connection between strong fe  ii emission and large @xmath59 , some suggestions have been proposed .",
    "@xcite suggested the x - ray spectrum becomes steeper in high @xmath59 agn .",
    "if the euv  x - ray spectrum plays an important role in the formation and confinement of the blr clouds ( e.g. , krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) , a steep x - ray spectrum coupled to a flatter euv spectrum will lead to a thicker blr ( e.g. , komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 ) , and thus stronger fe  ii emission if the the low - excitation part of the blr is mechanically heated @xcite .",
    "increased metal abundances in more extreme nls1 galaxies @xcite would enhance these trends , i.e. lead to thicker blrs @xcite .",
    "supersolar iron abundance may additionally boost the strength of fe  ii . in another model by @xcite ,",
    "fe  ii line emission is produced in an accretion disk .",
    "the agn with higher @xmath59 might simply have more mass in the accretion disk to produce stronger fe  ii emission by postulating collisional excitation @xcite as the origin of the fe  ii emission in general .",
    "the strong correlations of properties linking dynamics ( line widths ) , kinematics ( line shifts ) , ionization in blr and nlr ( fe  ii and [ o  iii ] strengths ) , and radiation process ( x - ray spectral shape ) are likely driven by an intrinsic properties , i.e. , the @xmath59 . in order to further test the favored scenario ( and get more constraints on , e.g. ,",
    "the density of the nlr ) , larger and even more complete agn sample with higher resolution optical data is needed .",
    "this paper presents the statistical study of optical emission line properties of a bright agn sample selected from rass .",
    "the sample comprises 155 seyfert  1 type agn .",
    "our conclusions based on the correlation analysis can be succinctly summarized as follows :    * the previously reported correlations between the strengths of fe  ii , [ o  iii ] emission and the x - ray slope are confirmed .",
    "strong optical fe  ii blends go along with weak forbidden emission lines ( e.g. , [ o  iii ] ) and steep x - ray slopes . *",
    "the anti - correlation between the x - ray spectral slope @xmath62 and the fwhm of h@xmath0 becomes prominent as far as the high luminosity agn are concerned .",
    "* striking correlations between the h@xmath0 redshift , fe  ii / h@xmath34 and [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 are found .",
    "there is a general trend that strong fe  ii / h@xmath34weak [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 objects tend to have blueshifts in h@xmath0 while strong [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 weak fe  ii / h@xmath34 objects tend to have redshifts in h@xmath0 . *",
    "we add new arguments that the observed trends are likely driven by @xmath59 and describe some future observations that could further test this suggestion .",
