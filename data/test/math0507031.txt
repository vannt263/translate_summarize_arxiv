    "<S> the authors extended patience sorting to a full bijection between the symmetric group and certain pairs of combinatorial objects ( called _ pile configurations _ ) that are most naturally defined in terms of generalized permutation patterns and barred pattern avoidance . </S>",
    "<S> this extended patience sorting algorithm is very similar to the robinson - schensted - knuth ( or rsk ) correspondence , which is itself built from repeated application of the schensted insertion algorithm .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a geometric form for the extended patience sorting algorithm that is in some sense a natural dual algorithm to g. viennot s celebrated geometric rsk algorithm . unlike geometric rsk , though , the lattice paths coming from patience sorting are allowed to intersect . </S>",
    "<S> we thus also give a characterization for the intersections of these lattice paths in terms of the pile configurations associated with a given permutation under the extended patience sorting algorithm . </S>"
