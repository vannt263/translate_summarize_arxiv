    "a quantum game @xcite describes the strategic interaction among a set of players sharing quantum state(s ) .",
    "players strategic choices , or strategies @xcite , are local unitary transformations on the quantum state .",
    "the state evolves unitarily and finally the players payoffs , or utilities , are obtained by measuring the entangled state .",
    "it turns out that under certain situations sharing of an entangled quantum state can put the players in an advantageous position and more efficient outcome(s ) of the game can then emerge . for readers not familiar with the formalism of quantum theory @xcite , sharing an entangled state",
    "can be considered equivalent to the situation in which the players have ( shared ) access to a ` quantum system ' having some intrinsically non - classical aspects .",
    "a quantum game would then involve a strategic manoeuvring of the shared quantum system in which different and perhaps more efficient outcome(s ) of the game can emerge due to non - classical aspect(s ) of the shared system .",
    "now , it is well known that non - classical , and thus apparently strange , aspects of a shared quantum system can be expressed as constraints on probabilities relevant to the shared system .",
    "usually expressed as constraints in correlations , the famous bell s inequality bell1,bell2,bell3,aspect , chsh , peres can be re - expressed as constraints on the relevant joint probability and its marginals fine1,fine2,halliwell1,halliwell2 .",
    "essentially , bell s inequality emerges as being the necessary and sufficient condition requiring a joint probability distribution to exist given a set of marginals .",
    "it is well known that bell s inequality can be violated by a set of quantum mechanical probabilities  the probabilities that are obtained by the quantum probability rule .",
    "this turns out to be the case even though the quantum probabilities are normalized as the classical probabilities are .",
    "this is because for a set of marginal ( quantum ) probabilities that are obtained via the quantum probability rule , the corresponding joint probability distribution may not exist .",
    "the possibility to express truly non - classical aspects of a quantum system in only probabilistic terms @xcite has led to suggestions for schemes of quantum games iqbalweigert , iqbal , iqbal1,iqbal2,chappell , iqbal3 that do not refer to quantum states , unitary transformations , and/or the quantum measurement .    in a classical game allowing mixed strategies , the players strategies are convex linear combinations , with real coefficients , of their pure strategies @xcite .",
    "players strategies in a quantum game @xcite , however , are unitary transformations and thus belong to much larger strategy spaces . in order to obtain an improved comparison between classical and quantum games ,",
    "it was suggested that the players strategy sets need to be identical .",
    "this has motivated proposals @xcite of quantum games in which players strategies are classical , as being convex linear combinations ( with real coefficients ) of the classical strategies , and the quantum game emerges from the non - classical aspects of a shared probabilistic physical system  as expressed by the constraints on relevant probabilities and their marginals @xcite .    in the usual approach in the area of quantum games @xcite , a classical game is defined , or given , at the start and its quantum version is developed afterwards . the usual reasonable requirement being that the classical mixed - strategy game can be recovered from the quantum game .",
    "one then studies whether the quantum game offers any non - classical outcome(s ) . in this paper ,",
    "the players strategies in the quantum game remain classical whereas the new quantum , or non - classical , outcome(s ) of the game emerge from the peculiar quantum probabilities relevant to the quantum system that two players share to play the game .",
    "in contrast to the usual approach in quantum games , in which the players strategies are unitary transformations , here we consider a particular classical strategy pair and then enquire about the set of games for which that strategy pair can exist as a nash equilibrium ( ne ) @xcite . in particular , for a given strategy pair , we investigate whether there are such games for which that strategy pair can exist as a ne only when the corresponding bell s inequality is violated by the quantum probabilities relevant to the shared quantum system .",
    "we consider two - player games that can be played using the setting of generalized einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) experiments peres , chsh , cereceda .",
    "as is known , in this setting a probabilistic version of bell s inequality can be obtained fine1,fine2,cereceda , halliwell1,halliwell2 .",
    "we consider particular strategies and find the sets of games for which the strategies can exist as a ne only when bell s inequality is violated . by identifying such games ,",
    "we show that there exist strategic outcomes that can only be realized when the game is played quantum mechanically and also only when the corresponding bell s inequality is violated .",
    "a number of papers @xcite discuss using the setting of generalized einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) experiments cereceda for playing quantum games .",
    "essentially , this is because this setting permits consideration of probabilistic version of the corresponding bell s inequality , which allows constructing quantum games without referring to the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics including hilbert space , unitary transformations , entangling operations , and quantum measurements @xcite .    in the setting of the generalized epr experiment , alice and bob are spatially separated and are unable to communicate with each other . in an individual run ,",
    "both receive one half of a pair of particles originating from a common source . in the same run of the experiment , both",
    "choose one from two given ( pure ) strategies .",
    "these strategies are the two directions in space along which spin or polarization measurements can be made . as is the case for notation for coins , we denote these directions to be @xmath0 , @xmath1 for alice and @xmath2 , @xmath3 for bob .",
    "each measurement generates @xmath4  or @xmath5  as the outcome .",
    "experimental results are recorded for a large number of individual runs of the experiment .",
    "payoffs are then awarded that depend on the directions the players choose over many runs ( defining the players strategies ) , the matrix of the game they play , and the statistics of the measurement outcomes .",
    "for instance , we denote @xmath6 as the probability of both alice and bob obtaining @xmath4 when alice selects the direction @xmath0 whereas bob selects the direction @xmath2 .",
    "we write @xmath7 for the probability @xmath6 and @xmath8 for the probability @xmath9 and likewise one can then write down the relevant probabilities as    @xmath10    being normalized , epr probabilities @xmath11 satisfy the relations    @xmath12    consider ( [ epr probabilities ] ) where , for instance , when it is the interaction between alice s type  @xmath13 and bob of type  @xmath14 , and the stern - gerlach detectors are rotated along these directions , the probability that both experimental outcomes are @xmath5 is @xmath15 and the probability that the observer @xmath14 s experimental outcome is @xmath4 and observer @xmath13 s experimental outcome is @xmath5 is given by @xmath16 . the other entries in ( [ epr probabilities ] ) can similarly be explained .",
    "we now consider a game between two players alice and bob , which is defined by the real numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and is given by    @xmath20    for this game , we now define the players payoff relations as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , for example , is alice s payoff when she plays @xmath0 and bob plays @xmath3 .    it can be seen that in the way it is defined , the game is inherently probabilistic .",
    "that is , in ( [ gamedef ] ) the players payoffs even for their pure strategies assume an underlying probability distribution as given by ( [ epr probabilities ] ) .",
    "now , we can also define a mixed - strategy version of this game inherently probabilistic game as follows .",
    "consider alice playing the strategy @xmath0 with probability @xmath23 and the strategy @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 whereas bob playing the strategy @xmath26 with probability @xmath27 and the strategy @xmath3 with probability @xmath28",
    ". using ( [ gamedef],[payoffparts ] ) the players mixed strategy payoff relations can then be obtained as    @xmath29    assuming that the strategy pair @xmath30 is a nash equilibrium , we then require    @xmath31    that takes the form    @xmath32    although this game is played using the setting of generalized epr experiments , in which the players strategies consist of choosing between two directions , one can notice that under appropriate conditions , the game can be reduced to the usual mixed - strategy version of the standard two - player two - strategy noncooperative game .",
    "non - cooperative games were investigated in the early work in the area of quantum games . to see this",
    ", we consider the case when    @xmath33    and then from eqs .",
    "( [ payoffparts ] ) and ( [ normalization ] ) we obtain    @xmath34    nash inequalities for the strategy pair @xmath35 then take the form    @xmath36    which give us nash inequalities for the mixed strategy @xmath37 for the following symmetric game    @xmath38    when @xmath39 this game results in the well known game of prisoners dilemma . as is well known , for this game @xmath40 comes out as the unique ne .",
    "we note that , in a particular run of the epr experiment , the outcome of @xmath4 or @xmath5 ( obtained along the direction @xmath0 or direction @xmath41 ) is independent of whether the direction @xmath2 or the direction @xmath42 is chosen in that run .",
    "similarly , the outcome of @xmath4 or @xmath43 ( obtained along @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) is independent of whether the direction @xmath0 or the direction @xmath41 is chosen in that run . these requirements , when translated in terms of the probability set @xmath44 are expressed as    @xmath45    a convenient solution of the system ( [ normalization],localityconstraint ) , as reported in @xcite is the one for which the set of probabilities @xmath46 is expressed in terms of the remaining set of probabilities @xmath47 that is given as    @xmath48    this allows us to consider the elements of the set @xmath49 as independent variables .",
    "relevant to the epr setting is the chsh ( clauser - horne - shimony - holt ) form of bell s inequality that is usually expressed in terms of the correlations @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . using ( [ epr probabilities ] ) the correlation @xmath54 , for instance , can be obtained as    @xmath55    expressions for the correlations @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 can similarly be obtained .",
