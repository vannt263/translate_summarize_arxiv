    "the solar neutrino problem and the atmospheric anomaly belong to the category of long base - line phenomena using natural neutrino sources . along with the short base - line oscillation",
    "experiments the long base - line projects with man - made neutrino sources are very promising . among them",
    "the recent chooz project using reactor neutrinos was completed with a negative effect @xcite .",
    "most others are planned for installation at high energy accelerators .",
    "the k2k project @xcite has taken the first run recently and has shown a preliminary first cc - event @xcite .",
    "minos at fermilab - soudan @xcite and icarus at cern - gran sasso @xcite are in a preparatory stage .",
    "the traditional interpretation of the origin of neutrino anomalies is the oscillation mechanism .",
    "another approach is the possibility of decay of conventional massive neutrinos , which may decay in some mixing components into a singlet majoron and another neutrino , as summarised in ref .",
    "this decay theory is restricted by very low upper limits on neutrino masses .    as an alternative",
    ", we suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite a three - body decay mechanism to explain the existing oscillation hints , which considers neutrinos as time - like leptons and where the heavier neutrinos may decay according to the dual principle in the super - luminous lorentz transformation ( slt ) .",
    "the idea is based on the symmetry between space - like and time - like bradyons , following e. recami et al .",
    "@xcite , according to which we may suggest that in the super - luminous lorentz transformation the space and the time dimensions should replace each other . as a result",
    ", tachyons may travel in a 3-dimension time while moving in an unique space direction .",
    "a very severe problem is that no tachyon was ever observed in an experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "neutrinos are an exception with the following appearances of tachyon properties :    - there is a very high symmetry between neutrinos and space - like leptons which is enhanced in the electro - weak unification ;    - each neutrino has its unique space direction , left or right , described by a definite helicity ;    - neutrinos never stop in a space position , similarly as a space - like particle can never stop in a moment of time - evolution .",
    "a big challenge is the fact that all neutrinos seem to have very small mass , which disturbs the lepton - neutrino symmetry . to solve this problem we assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that neutrinos are realistic tachyons , however due to weak interaction their transcendent masses m being complex have to be strongly suppressed .",
    "we suggested that the real part of mass is roughly equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the decay width of the unstable lepton and @xmath2 is its rest mass .",
    "the imaginary part of tachyon mass is suppressed by the factor @xmath3 , i.e. to the first order by the fermi constant @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the imaginary part may be measured in parity non - conserving experiments by interference of the weak interaction and electro - magnetic or nuclear force .",
    "generally , we may vary the rest mass @xmath2 as a free parameter to fit the experiments . in this work , however , we prefer to test the first order approximation by making the extreme assumption of time - space symmetry , i.e. that the absolute value of the transcendent mass of a neutrino is equal to the rest mass of its bradyon partner . for unification of the formalism",
    "we extend a similar formula for @xmath5 of unstable leptons to the electron , which does not harm the conclusion that electron neutrinos as time - like electrons should be stable . as a result",
    ", we have got a formalism almost without free parameters in our calculation . in table",
    "[ tab : mass ] we show the observable transcendent masses of space - like neutrino - tachyons or time - like leptons :    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    .observable transcendent masses of neutrino - tachyons [ tab : mass ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    2 for @xmath6 protons on target ( p.o.t . ) at k2k , if the muon neutrino decay works , only @xmath7 cc - events will be collected and if the particle identification ( pid ) works well only electron - like events , but no muon - like events will be seen . here",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the electron neutrinos are majorana . in this case",
    "only the dirac component may be detected , as in the solar neutrino flux and , as a result , the total amount of electron - like events may be decreased up to 50% ( for the maximum mixing @xcite ) .    for the oscillation mechanism",
    "there are different possibilities : i/ when the ( @xmath8 ) version works , we may have more electron - like events @xmath9 from the oscillation and an amounts of muon - like ones @xmath10 from the survivors of the initial muon neutrino spectrum ; ii/ when the ( @xmath11 ) version works , we may see the same amount of muon - like events from the surviving muon neutrinos , however the rate of cc - events from the tauon neutrinos decreases significantly , due to the high threshold of the @xmath12n reaction and the low ratios of tauon decay into muon or electron , which are 17.9% and 17.4% , respectively @xcite .",
    "the first run of k2k at super - k has seen the first cc - event @xcite .",
    "we have to wait for the next run in year 2000 , for sufficient statistics before making any definite conclusion . according to table  [ tab : ratev ] , minos will give more statistics to identify the origin of the oscillation hints .",
    "in the super - k long base - line detector we expect to identify muon - like events from electron - like ones as a criteria to test the three - body decay of muon neutrinos .",
    "the shape of the spectra and the quantity of cc - events are also sensitive to the origin of the oscillation hints .",
    "if the decay mechanism works , we suggest to the next long base - line experiments to use intensively the shorter base - line detectors .",
    "the optimal condition for observation is to get significant amounts of neutrino decays to see electron - like events , not to harm the intense flux to see also a proportion of muon - like events , that a decay rate larger than say 20% is desirable .",
    "it leads to a ratio @xmath13 and the base - line @xmath14(km ) equal to : 2.1 ; 15.3 and 41.8 km respectively , for the kek front detector , cosmos and jura .",
    "the experiments with modified shorter base - line detectors might collect a significant statistics for a short period .",
    "for example , 0.5 kton fiducial volume of the kek front detector at the distance 2.1 km may see @xmath15 muon - like and about ( 4 - 8)@xmath16 electron - like events for @xmath6 p.o.t .",
