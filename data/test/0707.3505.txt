    "this is nevertheless quite far - fetched as this would correspond to a very large mass of gas : 2@xmath66  m@xmath4 , assuming a canonical galactic ( cold)dust - to - gas mass ratios of 1/150 , and excluded given our non - detection of the co(2 - 1 ) line and the excitation temperature of co(2 - 1 ) ( t@xmath67 k ) .",

    "this would require @xmath68 to explain the discrepancy between the [ oii ] emission line and the submillimetre continuum flux .",
    "( 2 ) this host is member of a cluster and is an anemic or passive spiral galaxy @xcite . in this case , one can wonder given the absence of cross - identification in radio if this submillimetre flux might not be associated with a background galaxy rather than with sn1997ey host . if one considers the 8@xmath38 beam ( fwhp ) of scuba at 450@xmath1 m and integrates up to @xmath69 a schechter function ( with @xmath70 , @xmath71mpc@xmath72 , m@xmath73 , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite performed a statistical analysis to determine the association rate of grb and sn .",
    "they consider both short and long duration bursts as well as core - collapse and type - ia supernovae .",
    "surprisingly , the short burst grb971221 has thus been associated with sn1997ey .",
    "the burst was detected 1997 december 21 , while the supernova was discovered on december 29 ( expected to be the maximum of the light curve @xmath91 6 days ) .",
    "as the maximum of sn - ia light curves is expected @xmath92 days after the explosion @xcite , the association is plausible .",
    "however , the error box of 6.3 degree affecting grb050709 position is so large that the probability of a chance alignment is huge . if one integrates up to @xmath69 a schechter function ( with @xmath70 , @xmath71mpc@xmath72 , m@xmath73 , * ? ? ?",

    ", one can expect about 140 ( resp . 2000 ) snia , while 0.007 short grb would be expected .",

    "only a few short grb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) were intensively monitored to exclude definitively some association with sn . from a theoretical point of view , short grb",
    "are usually thought to be generated by the merger of two neutrons stars or one neutron star with a black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , @xcite suggested that the merger of two white dwarves could lead to the formation of a magnetar , which could produce short grb as studied by @xcite .",
