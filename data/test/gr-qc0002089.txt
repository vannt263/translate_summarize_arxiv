    "gravitational waves in inflationary cosmology are produced by sub - hubble scale vacuum fluctuations .",
    "they are stretched to super - hubble scales by inflationary expansion , and then they generate anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( see , e.g. , grishchuk 1975 , mukhanov et al .",
    "1992 ) . scales which re - enter before matter - radiation equality will rapidly redshift ( and suffer small damping during recombination ) , having negligible effect on cmb temperature anisotropies , while scales which re - enter later can affect the temperature anisotropies at large angles . roughly speaking ,",
    "we can approximate the impact of gravitational waves upon cmb temperature anisotropies by neglecting all local causal dynamics and treating the large - scale fluctuations as frozen beyond the hubble scale until re - entry , where their amplitude is conserved and determined by the inflationary hubble rate at the time of hubble - crossing .",
    "this picture is confirmed by the evolution equation ( lifshitz 1946 ) @xmath0 for the fourier modes of the transverse traceless tensor perturbation @xmath1 , defined ( on a flat background ) by @xmath2\\ , .",
    "\\label{2}\\ ] ] equation ( [ 1 ] ) shows that on very large scales , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 . if @xmath7 then the @xmath8-mode is decaying , and we have @xmath9 constant , with the constant determined by the hubble rate at inflationary hubble - crossing , @xmath10 .",
    "this simple picture is modified by small corrections induced at preheating . at the end of slow - roll inflation , the inflaton oscillates and transfers its energy to fluctuations , initiating the reheating era , which ends when created particles thermalize as a radiative plasma .",
    "reheating is often initiated by a preheating era , marked by coherent inflaton oscillations which drive parametric resonant amplification of scalar fluctuations ( see , e.g. , traschen and brandenberger 1990 , kofman et al . 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "one crucial point about preheating is that , since the inflaton is coherent on scales well beyond the hubble horizon , it is in principle possible for super - hubble fluctuations to be amplified _ without violating causality _ ( bassett et al .",
    "1999a , b ) . in the case of scalar fluctuations of",
    "the _ metric _ , this can in principle produce nonlinear amplification , depending on initial conditions and coupling strengths ( bassett et al .",
    "1999a , b , c , 2000 , ivanov 2000 , jedamzik and sigl 2000 , liddle et al . 2000 ) .",
    "while tensor fluctuations will not be strongly amplified by scalar inflaton oscillations , these oscillations nevertheless could leave an imprint on the tensor spectrum on large scales .",
    "such a possibility is usually ruled out on causality grounds , but no such causality constraint operates during coherent oscillations of the inflaton condensate .    these small corrections will be carried into eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) via the scale factor , which inherits an oscillatory addition to its average value .",
    "however , the nature of the effect is more clearly brought out via an alternative description of gravitational waves , based on the idea that a full characterization requires the curvature tensor , not the metric ( pirani 1957 ) .",
    "transverse traceless modes are given by the divergence - free electric and magnetic parts of the weyl tensor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the background four - velocity ( there are no velocity perturbations for tensor modes ) .",
    "this covariant description of gravitational waves was used by hawking ( 1966 ) , and is remarkably analogous to electromagnetic radiation theory ( dunsby et al .",
    "1997 , maartens and bassett 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the maxwell - weyl approach to gravitational waves to investigate the effects of inflaton oscillations in some simple preheating models , generalizing previous work in minkowski spacetime ( bassett 1997 ) . in sections 2 and 3",
    ", we give the basic equations and their qualitative properties . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical calculations , and section 5 contains concluding remarks and discussion .",
    "the background inflaton is governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "we will consider the simple chaotic inflation potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "although the resonance in scalar fluctuations is dramatically increased when the inflaton is coupled to other fields , for example via the additional potential term @xmath17 , this does not seem to have an effect on _ tensor _ fluctuations ( tilley 2000 ) .",
    "thus we will confine ourselves to simplified single - field models of preheating .",
    "preheating in more realistic models ends when backreaction effects of the fluctuations destroy the coherence of inflaton oscillations . in our simplified models ,",
    "backreaction effects are not incorporated , but we can use the results from detailed investigations to estimate the time that preheating lasts ( see , e.g. , kofman et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the hubble rate is determined by the friedmann equation @xmath18\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 .",
    "equations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) imply @xmath20 .",
    "the energy density and effective pressure of the inflaton are @xmath21    during slow - roll inflation , the coupled equations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) have approximate analytic solutions for the simple potentials .",
    "when the value of @xmath22 drops low enough , slow - roll ends and the oscillatory regime begins .",
    "the approximate analytic forms are ( see , e.g. , kaiser 1997 , kofman et al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 and cn is a jacobian elliptic function .",
    "the initial values of @xmath25 are @xmath26 in the quadratic case , and @xmath27 in the quartic case .",
    "time - averaging over oscillations shows that @xmath28 for the quadratic potential , and @xmath29 for the quartic potential .",
    "these are the asymptotic values of the scale factor , but in practice backreaction effects due to couplings will end the preheating oscillations . if one uses the average forms @xmath30 for @xmath31 , i.e. , if one ignores oscillatory behaviour in the inflaton , then one regains the standard results for gravitational wave evolution in the dust and radiation eras .",
    "in particular , models with a smooth transition from inflation to radiation - domination , neglecting reheating dynamics , show that there is no super - hubble amplification of gravitational waves ( e.g. caldwell 1996 , tilley and maartens 1998 ) .",
    "our numerical integrations show that this averaging loses interesting features in the gravitational waves ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we do not use the approximate forms in eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) for our numerical results  instead",
    ", we integrate the friedmann and klein - gordon equations numerically .",
    "gravitational wave perturbations in the covariant approach are governed by the maxwell - weyl equations : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the shear , a dot denotes @xmath34 , and div and curl are the covariant spatial divergence and curl for tensors ( maartens and bassett 1998 ) .",
    "these equations hold for perfect fluids and minimally coupled scalar fields ( in which case @xmath35 ) .",
    "the shear is a tensor potential for the electric and magnetic weyl tensors ( maartens and bassett 1998 ) : @xmath36 in close analogy with the maxwell relations @xmath37 and @xmath38 . taking the curl and dot of the maxwell - weyl propagation equations , and using the identity for the tensor curl of the curl , we find wave equations for the three tensors ( dunsby et al .",
    "1997 , maartens and bassett 1998 , challinor 2000 ) .",

    "one can also derive a wave equation for the shear : @xmath41\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } = \\delta \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\,.\\ ] ]    we decompose the tensors into modes ( challinor 2000 ) @xmath42\\,,\\label{14}\\\\ h_{\\mu\\nu } & = & a^{-2}\\sum k^2\\left[{\\cal h}_kq_{\\mu\\nu}^{(k)}+ \\tilde{\\cal h}_k\\tilde{q}_{\\mu\\nu}^{(k)}\\right]\\,,\\label{15}\\\\ \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } & = & a^{-1}\\sum k\\left[{\\cal s}_kq_{\\mu\\nu}^{(k)}+ \\tilde{\\cal s}_k\\tilde{q}_{\\mu\\nu}^{(k)}\\right]\\,,\\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes a symbolic sum over harmonic modes , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are tensor harmonics of electric and magnetic parity , which are time - independent , transverse traceless , and related by @xmath46 showing that the different polarization states are coupled . the mode functions @xmath47 determine the tensor contribution to the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the magnetic weyl mode functions are algebraically related to the shear mode functions by @xmath48 specializing the results in challinor ( 2000 ) to the scalar field case , we find the evolution equations @xmath49    for comparison , in the time - averaged approximation , the @xmath50 term in the coefficient of @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) is replaced by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , with @xmath54 for the averaged quadratic case ( i.e. cold matter or ` dust ' ) , and @xmath55 for the averaged quartic case ( i.e. radiation ) .",
    "equations ( [ 17])([19 ] ) for the gravitational wave perturbations , and ( [ 4])([5 ] ) for the background are integrated numerically , and the results are compared with those for the time - averaged approximation .",
    "we investigated the evolution of cobe modes , which left the hubble radius at about 50 to 60 e - folds before the end of inflation , so that @xmath56 at the start of preheating , @xmath57 .",

    "apart from specific features peculiar to the potential , these figures reflect two key properties : ( 1 ) super - hubble gravitational waves are not significantly amplified by coherent inflaton oscillations during preheating ; ( 2 ) gravitational waves on all scales carry some imprint of the coherent oscillatory dynamics of the inflaton during preheating .",
    "the latter point is clearly brought out by a comparison with the evolution in the absence of oscillations , i.e. for the time - averaged scale factor .",
    "in particular , one can see that the electric weyl modes on super - hubble scales , which determine the effect of gravitational waves on the cmb ( challinor 2000 ) , inherit oscillations from the inflaton . in the early part of preheating",
    ", there is also some amplification on average of @xmath47 , so that if backreaction takes effect early , then this does produce a small amplification relative to the no - oscillation time - averaged model .",
    "however , one can not expect these preheating imprints on @xmath47 to lead to detectable differences in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "firstly , the oscillations will effectively be averaged out , and secondly , any amplification is likely to be scale invariant for all measurable anisotropies , since the hubble scale at preheating corresponds to about 1 metre today , so that all cosmologically significant scales at preheating effectively have @xmath68 , and behave like the particular scale chosen in our numerical integrations ( bassett et al .",
    "2000 , jedamzik and sigl 2000 ) .",
    "gravitational waves on sub - hubble scales oscillate even in the case of time - averaged background , but figs . 3 , 4 , 7 and 8",
    "show that the frequency and amplitude of oscillation are significantly modulated by the inflaton oscillations . thus preheating leaves an imprint on these scales . in principle , this could be detected , but in practice the signal will be far too weak , since there is no preheating amplification on these scales .",
    "the absence of amplification is fundamentally due to the expansion of the universe , since there is strong amplification on a minkowski background of gravitational waves during preheating ( bassett 1997 , tilley 2000 ) . + * acknowledgement : * we thank bruce bassett for valuable discussions and comments .",
