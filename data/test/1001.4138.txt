    "while the equations governing the dynamics of non - magnetized stellar plasma are well known , a fundamental understanding of fully developed turbulent flow remains elusive .",
    "a reynolds decomposition , whereby the properties of the stellar plasma are separated into mean and fluctuating components @xmath0 provides some insight into the problem . decomposing the kinetic energy equation ( formulated by the product of the velocity and the momentum equation ) in this way and taking temporal and angular averages ( indicated by the operator @xmath1 ) results in @xcite    @xmath2    which is the full non - linear governing equation of interest .",
    "the primary goal of any stellar turbulence theory is to model the terms of this equation , including the rate of buoyancy work @xmath3 , the kinetic energy flux @xmath4 , the pressure correlation flux @xmath5 , the work done by pressure fluctuations @xmath6 , and the rate at which kinetic energy @xmath7 , is dissipated @xmath8 .",
    "differential rotation and circulation currents introduce additional sources of turbulence and transport terms .",
    "it is standard practice to ignore or grossly approximate most of these terms in stellar evolution calculations .",
    "for instance , mixing length theory ( mlt ) ignores @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 and approximates the _ integral _ of @xmath11 over a mixing length as the _ product _ of local properties of the flow . the time dependence expressed by the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : fke ] is also dropped .",
    "though still not widely used , some strides have been made to compensate for these deficiencies through embellished mlt type algorithms , most notably to address the issue of time dependence and the non - local nature of turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in order to develop a more realistic physical description of stellar turbulence , which is of central importance to modeling stellar pulsation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a better understanding of these non - linear terms is needed .",
    "a powerful method for gaining insight into this physics is analyzing fully non - linear simulation data . in the following",
    "we present a few select models from a new suite of turbulent stellar convection simulations designed to this end and briefly discuss the origin of the kinetic energy flux and its relationship to the kinetic energy dissipation and the large scale topology of the flow .",

    "variations in the driving source are made in order to study how this impacts the global characteristics of the flow , and in turn how this affects the transport terms .",
    "three models are presented including two in which heating ( by nuclear burning ) is present and one in which convection is driven by a cooling region near the top of the convection zone ( similar to radiative losses in surface convection zones ) .",
    "the heating and cooling profiles are presented in fig  1 .",
    "the heated and cooled regions ( @xmath13 ) are initially nearly adiabatic , and thus neutrally buoyant , while the surrounding layers are stably stratified .",
    "the fully compressible , reactive euler equations are solved using the prompi code @xcite which is a descendant of the prometheus piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) code @xcite adapted to parallel computing platforms .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the sensitivity of our results on resolution are tested within limits of computational cost by a series of higher resolution runs .",
    "a summary of simulation properties is presented in table  1 .",
    "the time evolution of the kinetic energy is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the convective turnover time @xmath14 is a little less than @xmath15100 s for all of the models studied .",
    "after an initial transient comparable to @xmath16 the models attain a quasi - steady state .",
    "the strong damping present in turbulent flow ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ensures that this state is reached within @xmath17 .",
    "time averages for analysis are performed over intervals that encompass @xmath18 and are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the simulated convection is very efficient in all cases and deviates only mildly from an isentropic state .",
    "since the simulated regions are not in thermal balance ( there is either a net heating or cooling ) the entropy will change over time and the fluxes and flows within the convection zones adjust to establish an isentropic state at each moment .",
    "in this situation the rate of entropy change at any one location is equal to that of the mass averaged rate over the convection zone , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 indicates a mass weighted average over the turbulent region . from the first law ( @xmath21 ) and the fundamental thermodynamic relationship ( @xmath22 )    @xmath23    and the convective luminosity is    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the local heating or cooling term ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the convective flux found from this relationship is compared to the simulation data in fig  2 for all three models .",
    "the good agreement shows that thermal relaxation is not necessary to study turbulent convection but can be incorporated into the analysis . a much more important effect than this slow thermal relaxation is the luminosity associated with boundary layer mixing events which is as large as @xmath2640% of peak in model c1 .",
    "the kinetic energy dissipation @xmath8 is required to appropriately calculate @xmath27 and is included in standard stellar evolution ( i.e. , mlt ) only implicitly through the structure variable @xmath28 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 throughout a convection zone , however , is intimately related to the resulting kinetic energy flux , which we discuss next .",
    "in quasi - steady states where @xmath9 and @xmath29 are not important the kinetic energy flux ( or luminosity ) can be found by integrating eq .  1    @xmath30    with @xmath31 . in this expression",
    "the radial component of the rate of buoyancy work is written in terms of the convective energy flux with @xmath32 for pressure scale height @xmath33 and adiabatic gradient @xmath34 .",
    "this expression for @xmath35 can be calculated directly from the background structure ( eq .  3 ) and is appropriate for small density fluctuations that can be linearly related to temperature fluctuations using the isobaric thermodynamic derivative , a good approximation in most cases of deep , nearly adiabatic convection .",
    "from eq .",
    "[ eq : ltot ] we see that _ the kinetic energy flux is the residual between buoyancy driving and viscous dissipation . _",
    "globally , the integrated dissipation @xmath36 is constrained by both the thermal state evolution , @xmath37 ( eq . 2 , 3 ) , and the balance with buoyancy driving ( eq .",
    "4 , noting that @xmath38 ) .",
    "the radial profile of @xmath8 is determined by the topology of the convective flow .",
    "@xcite show that the dissipation is well described by the properties of the isotropic component of turbulence , @xmath39 with @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the largest scale of motion in the flow and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the non - radial velocity fluctuations .    in fig .",
    "3 we present the radial distribution of the kinetic energy from the simulation data .",
    "the first panel shows the total @xmath7 and the second panel shows the horizontal component scaled to an equivalent isotropic value , @xmath44 .",
    "the increase in @xmath45 at the boundaries of the convection zones are due to the horizontal deflection of the large scale flow and wave motions excited in stable layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and should be corrected for when identifying @xmath46 with the convective turbulence .    in fig .  3 ( right ) we over plot two approximations to @xmath46 : one based on a uniform distribution of dissipation and one based on a dissipation that decreases linearly with enclosed mass .",
    "the relationship @xmath47 with @xmath48 is used .",
    "the absolute scale of the dissipation and kinetic energy profiles are provided by the constraint that the global dissipation rate must balance the global rate of buoyancy driving .",
    "the amplitude of the kinetic energy that satisfies this global balance is found by varying it until the boundary conditions on @xmath49 are satisfied ( i.e. , @xmath50 at the boundaries of the convection zone ) .",
    "@xmath51 provides a good first approximation .",
    "the kinetic energy fluxes found using this procedure are compared to the simulation data in fig .  4 for the two assumed dissipation profiles .",
    "we have provided a basic overview of the connection between turbulent dissipation and the kinetic energy flux in efficient ( high pclet number ) convection .",
    "the only assumption made in our analysis involved the radial profile of the dissipation @xmath8 which we will discuss in a future publication .",
    "for now we shall suffice to say that the dissipation can be derived directly from the stellar model by adopting certain constraints on the topology of the convective flow .",
    "in particular , a two component flow model consisting of a background isotropic turbulent state and a large scale , plume - like flow is a promising approach .    the data presented in figs .  3 and 4",
    "illustrate the shortcomings of the commonly used closure relation referred to as the _ down gradient approximation_. ] .",
    "most illustrative is the fact that while the @xmath7 distributions are nearly identical in models h1 and c1 the @xmath49 profiles are roughly mirror images .",
    "the locally defined down gradient approximation flux fails because the properties of the turbulent transport are strongly shaped by global constraints , a feature that is captured by the analysis presented in ",
    "[ sec : keflux ] .",
    "another consequence of the distribution of kinetic energy within the convection zone is the rate of boundary layer mixing ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which can significantly modify the stellar structure on evolutionary timescales ( see  7 in * ? ? ?",
