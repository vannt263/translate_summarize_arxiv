    "numerous observations , from galaxy rotation curves to gravitational lensing , to cosmic microwave background radiation , all point to the existence of dark matter which is not made of ordinary atoms , but , rather , of some new , yet undiscovered particles .",
    "in particular , the abundance of dark matter has been precisely determined recently by the wmap  @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of dark - matter particles remains unknown .",
    "one attractive candidate is a sterile neutrino with mass of several kev and a small mixing with the ordinary neutrinos .",
    "if such a particle exists , it could be produced in the early universe with the right abundance to be dark matter either from neutrino oscillations  @xcite , or from some other processes , for example from inflaton decay  @xcite .",
    "the same particle can explain the observed velocities of pulsars because its emission from a cooling neutron star would be anisotropic , hence providing the neutron star with a recoil velocity of a sufficient magnitude @xcite .",
    "in addition , the neutrino kick can enhance the convection during the first second of the supernova explosion , which can increase the energy of the supernova shock and bring the supernova calculations in better agreement with the observations @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos can also help the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe @xcite .",
    "although the dark - matter sterile neutrinos have interactions that are too weak to be discovered in the laboratory , some other sterile neutrinos may exist .",
    "most models of neutrino masses introduce sterile ( or right - handed ) neutrinos to generate masses of the ordinary neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the name _ sterile _ was coined by  @xcite .",
    "many seesaw models assume that sterile neutrinos have very large masses , which makes them unobservable .",
    "however , a number of theoretical models predict the existence of sterile neutrinos at or below the electroweak scale  @xcite . there is an indication that some light sterile mass eigenstates may cause the neutrino flavor transformation seen in the los alamos liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment @xcite .",
    "the results of lsnd are being tested by the miniboone experiment .",
    "one can expect that there are at least three light sterile neutrinos @xcite , in which case the neutrino oscillations can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "although dark - matter sterile neutrinos are stable on cosmological time scales , they nevertheless decay . the mass matrix is assumed to have the seesaw form with the majorana mass term of the order of several kev and with a much smaller dirac mass term .",
    "the diagonalization of such a mass matrix yields the light mostly active majorana mass eigenstates and the heavy sterile majorana eigenstates , which can decay into the light ones .",
    "the dominant decay mode , into three light neutrinos , is `` invisible '' because the daughter neutrinos are beyond the detection capabilities of today s experiments .",
    "the most prominent `` visible '' mode is decay into one active neutrino and one photon , @xmath0 . assuming two - neutrino mixing for simplicity",
    ", one can express the inverse width of such a decay as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass and @xmath3 is the mixing angle .",
    "for mass units we set @xmath4 .    since this is a two - body decay , the photon energy is half the mass of the sterile neutrino .",
    "the monochromatic line from dark matter decays can , in principle , be observed by x - ray telescopes .",
    "no such observation has been reported , and some important limits have been derived on the allowed masses and mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "these constraints are based on different astrophysical objects , from virgo and coma clusters , to large magellanic clouds , to the milky way halo and its components , etc .",
    "there are different uncertainties in modeling the dark matter populations in these objects .",
    "different groups have also used very different methodologies in deriving these bounds : from a conservative assumption that the dark - matter line should not exceed the signal , to more ambitious approaches that involved modeling the signal or merely fitting it with a smooth curve and requiring that the line - shaped addition not affect the quality of the fit .",
    "the x - ray limits are usually shown based on the assumption that the sterile neutrinos constitute the entire dark matter ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer to the sterile neutrinos and the dark matter , respectively ) .",
    "however , the x - ray observations exclude certain masses and mixing angles even if the sterile neutrinos make up only a fraction of dark matter .",
    "the production via mixing @xcite provides the lowest possible abundance of sterile neutrinos . in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] we show both the bounds based on the assumption @xmath5 and the model - independent exclusion region  @xcite based on the production only via the @xcite mechanism .",
    "@xcite used the analytical fit to the numerical calculation of @xcite , and re - scaled the x - ray flux in proportion to the amount of relic neutrinos produced for a given mass and mixing angle .",
    "a different set of bounds comes from the observations of the lyman - alpha forest  @xcite , which limit the sterile neutrino mass from below .",
    "based on the high - redshift data from sdss and some modeling of gas dynamics , one can set a limit as strong as 14  kev  @xcite .",
    "however , the high - redshift data have systematic errors that are not well understood  @xcite , and more conservative approaches , based on the relatively low - redshift data , have led to some less stringent bounds  @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have reanalyzed the high - redshift data and arrived at the bound @xmath8  kev .",
    "the mass bound as quoted depends on the production mechanism in the early universe .",
    "the lyman - alpha observations constrain the free - streaming lengths of dark matter particles , not their masses . for each cosmological production mechanism ,",
    "the relation between the free - streaming length and the mass is different  @xcite .",
    "for example , the bound @xmath9  kev  @xcite applies to the production model due to  @xcite . even within a given cosmological scenario ,",
    "there are uncertainties in the production rates of neutrinos for any given mass and mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties may further affect the interpretation of the lyman - alpha bounds in terms of the sterile neutrino mass .",
    "the x - ray bounds depend on a combination of mass and mixing angle as in eq .",
    "( [ meanlife ] ) , regardless of one s cosmological assumptions , as long as all the dark matter is comprised of sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , the x - ray bounds are subject to uncertainties in modeling the dark matter populations of different objects .",
    "if the sterile neutrinos make up only a part of dark matter , none of the above bounds apply .",
    "also , if inflation ended with a low reheating temperature , the bounds are significantly weaker  @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the lyman - alpha bounds appear to contradict the observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies  @xcite , which suggest that dark matter is warm and which would favor the 15  kev mass range for sterile neutrinos .",
    "there are several inconsistencies between the predictions of n - body simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and the observations @xcite .",
    "each of these problems may find a separate independent solution .",
    "perhaps , a better understanding of cdm on small scales will resolve these discrepancies .",
    "it is true , however , that warm dark matter in the form of sterile neutrinos is free from all these small - scale problems altogether , while on large scales wdm fits the data as well as cdm .    several independent considerations , from the pulsar kicks to small - scale behavior of dark matter , favor sterile neutrinos as the dark matter candidate .",
    "it is important , therefore , to examine the effects of sterile - neutrino dark matter on star formation and reionization of the universe .",
    "@xcite have attempted to study such effects for some kind of warm dark matter , but they have used a linear matter power spectrum and assumed that the dark matter particles have a thermal distribution , which is not the case for sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "even more importantly , they have not considered the effects of sterile neutrino decays and the resulting x - ray background .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the x - rays produced by the decays of relic sterile neutrinos can speed up the formation of molecular hydrogen , which can help the cooling of the gas and the star formation , which can lead , in turn , to a reionization of the universe at the redshift consistent with the wmap results .",
    "more specifically , the wmap ( three years ) measurement of the reionization redshift @xmath10 @xcite has posed a challenge to theories of star formation . on the one hand",
    ", stars have to form early enough to reionize gas at redshift  11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectra of bright distant quasars imply that reionization must be completed by redshift  6 .",
    "stars form in clouds of hydrogen which collapse at different times , depending on their sizes : the small clouds collapse first , while the large ones collapse last .",
    "if the big clouds must collapse by redshift  6 , then the small halos must undergo the collapse much earlier .",
    "it appears that the star formation in these small halos would have occurred at high redshift , when the gas density was very high , and it would have resulted in an excessive thompson optical depth @xcite . to be consistent with wmap , the efficiency for the production of ionizing photons in minihalos must have been at least an order of magnitude lower than expected  @xcite .",
    "one solution is to suppress the star formation rate in small halos by some dynamical feedback mechanism .",
    "the suppression required is by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "alternatively , one can consider warm dark matter , in which case the number of small clouds is strongly suppressed .",
    "however , for some wdm candidates ( for example , the gravitino ) , the lack of power on small scales in the spectrum of density perturbations leads to an unacceptable delay in the onset of star formation @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for sterile neutrinos , which decay slowly during the `` dark ages '' preceding the birth of stars .",
    "the decay photons could ionize gas , and , although this ionization is too weak to affect the wmap measurements directly  @xcite , the increase in the ionization fraction could cause a rapid production of molecular hydrogen at redshifts as high as 100  @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen is the essential cooling agent that allows the gas to cool and collapse to form the first stars .",
    "@xcite have not considered the effects of gas heating associated with the decays , which may , in some cases , thwart the effects of ionization .",
    "the increase in the fraction of molecular hydrogen can help cooling the gas , but if the heating from sterile neutrino decays is significant , it can overcome the radiative cooling and stymie the collapse and star formation .",
    "in this paper we will examine thermal evolution of gas clouds in detail , taking into account both effects of the sterile neutrino decays , namely the ionization and the heating of gas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_h2 ]",
    "we will discuss the role of sterile neutrino decays and the production of molecular hydrogen in the cooling of the primordial gas clouds .",
    "next , in sections 3 - 6 we will briefly describe the top - hat overdensity simulation .",
    "the results are shown in section  [ sec_results ] .",
    "the existence of the first objects is a direct consequence of the growth of the primordial density fluctuations . at the beginning , there are linear density perturbations which expand with the overall hubble flow .",
    "subsequently , these perturbations can grow and form primordial clouds .",
    "clouds with enough density contrast decouple from this flow and start to collapse .",
    "the kinetic energy of the infalling gas is dissipated through shocks and the cloud becomes pressure supported .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the cloud is determined by its ability to cool sufficiently fast .",
    "clouds that do not cool fast enough stay in a pressure - supported state and do not form stars .",
    "the existence of the efficient cooling mechanism is necessary to continue the collapse of the cloud , its subsequent fragmentation and star formation .    in the absence of metals",
    ", the most important cooling mechanism is cooling by hydrogen atoms and molecules .",
    "this mechanism involves the collisional excitation of h or h@xmath11 , subsequent spontaneous de - excitation , and photon emission .",
    "the emitted photons can escape and take away energy , hence reducing the kinetic energy of the collapsing cloud .",
    "cooling by h dominates for temperatures above @xmath12  k , while the h@xmath11 cooling is more important at lower temperatures .",
    "the temperature of the primordial cloud can be higher than @xmath12 k only during a short period of virialization of the baryonic gas .",
    "therefore , h@xmath11 cooling is the most important cooling mechanism during almost entire evolution of the halos , and it is crucial for the star formation .    in primordial gas clouds , h@xmath11 molecules can form mainly through the coupled reactions @xmath13 or @xmath14 in which @xmath15 and @xmath16 act only as a catalyst .",
    "x - ray radiation can increase the production of the h@xmath11 by enhancement of the ionization fraction .    as discussed above ,",
    "sterile neutrinos with the mass of several kev and a small mixing are stable on cosmological time scales .",
    "nevertheless some of them can decay .",
    "the decay channel important for us is @xmath17 its inverse width is given in equation ( [ meanlife ] ) .",
    "the energy of the photon is equal to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the active neutrino .",
    "x - ray photons from the sterile neutrinos decays can increase the ionization fraction and the h@xmath11 production .",
    "this can subsequently lead to a speed - up of the gas cooling and star formation .",
    "we will follow the evolution of the baryonic top - hat overdensity , the gas temperature and its h@xmath11 and @xmath15 fraction .",
    "our goal is to juxtapose the evolution of the gas temperature in the primordial clouds in the @xmath20cdm model and the wdm model with kev sterile neutrinos .",
    "we assume that the dark matter is smoothly distributed in the region we are considering .",
    "we will use the parameters from the best fit to the three years wmap data @xcite , namely @xmath21 km @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "let us take some spherical region with the top - hat overdensity @xmath30 .",
    "it is well known that such an overdensity will evolve according to the following equation @xcite @xmath31 where the parameter @xmath32 is related to the redshift @xmath33 and redshift of virialization @xmath34 through @xmath35    further evolution depends on the type of the matter in the overdense region .",
    "if it is the dark matter then after virialization its density remains constant forever .",
    "the situation is different in the case of baryons .",
    "if there exists an efficient cooling mechanism , then the density gradually increases . otherwise , the density remains constant , and there is no star formation in the halo .    in reality",
    "an overdense region consists of two components namely , baryonic gas and dark matter .",
    "baryonic density fluctuations are suppressed before recombination .",
    "in contrast , the dark matter density fluctuations can start to grow well before this period , so its initial overdensity is larger than that of the baryons .",
    "dark matter forms the potential wells into which the baryonic matter falls .",
    "overall , the baryon density follows the dark matter density in the early universe .",
    "therefore , one can consider the primordial fluctuations as the halos consisting of baryonic and dark matter , whose overall overdensity follow the top - hat solution ( eqs .",
    "[ th1 ] and [ th2 ] ) .",
    "of course , this assumption breaks down at the later stages of the halo evolution , e.g. after the virialization of the dark matter .",
    "following @xcite , let us assume that the evolution of the baryonic and dark matter density is described by equations ( [ th1 ] ) and ( [ th2 ] ) until @xmath32 reaches @xmath36 .",
    "this occurs at the redshift @xmath37 after this redshift , we assume that the density of the halo @xmath38 stays constant e.g. it is equal to the value @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "we note that the overdensity @xmath30 in equation ( [ th1 ] ) is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the combined average density of dark and baryonic matter .",
    "we have taken the ratio of the baryonic to the dark matter mass in the halo to be the standard cosmological ratio of @xmath43 .",
    "the density of the baryonic matter can be expressed as @xmath44",
    "the gas temperature evolution is governed by the equation of energy conservation @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath20 are the pressure , the internal energy per unit mass and the cooling / heating function respectively .",
    "we use the equation of state of perfect gas @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the adiabatic index .",
    "the internal energy per unit mass can be described as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath52 is the gas temperature , @xmath53 denotes the molecular weight , and @xmath54 is the mass of the hydrogen atom . introducing the number density of non dark matter particles @xmath55 we can write @xmath56 as @xmath57    if we use eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) , ( [ u ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) than we can cast eq .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) in the form @xmath58    the time @xmath59 can be translated to the redshift @xmath33 in the following way @xmath60 using eqs .",
    "( [ tt ] ) and ( [ hubble ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 to calculate the gas temperature of the primordial cloud we have to integrate this equation .",
    "one can assume that the gas temperature evolution is governed by eq .",
    "( [ tz ] ) except for the redshift range between @xmath62 and @xmath34 . if we simply integrate eq.([tz ] ) to the redshift @xmath34 , than the gas temperature will be much lower than the virial temperature @xmath63 , at least for clouds with mass greater than some critical value  @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are respectively the mean molecular weight during virialization , the halo mass and the overdensity of the halo at virialization given by @xcite , which is very well approximated by @xmath68 for redshifts @xmath69 .",
    "therefore we have to take into account shocks and increase the gas temperature to the virial value .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the gas temperature evolution is linear between the redshift @xmath62 and @xmath34 and is described by the equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the temperature at the redshift @xmath62 .",
    "let us consider the following five species : h , h@xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath15 , and @xmath74 with the mass fraction @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath76 ( @xmath77h , h@xmath72 , h@xmath11 , @xmath15 and he ) the number density of baryonic component @xmath78 .",

    "using eqs .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) , ( [ nbb ] ) and ( [ rob ] ) we can get @xmath85 at the virialization we have typically @xmath86 and @xmath87 , so one can take the mean molecular weight at this time to be @xmath88 .",

    "all the rates @xmath97 are given in table [ tab : reaction ] .",
    "we note in passing that neglecting he and h@xmath11 ionization renders the system with fewer free electrons , so the production of h@xmath11 is slower .",
    "in addition , cooling by h@xmath98 is stronger than by h@xmath11 ( see last figure in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the cooling we get in this approximation is somewhat less efficient than it should be in reality .",
    "the molecular hydrogen number fraction can be calculated by integration of the following equation @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the molecular hydrogen formation rate via @xmath101 and h@xmath98 channel @xcite . to get eq .",

    "we have compared the following four models :    1 .",
    "cold dark matter with no additional radiation besides cmb ( cdm ) .",
    "warm dark matter ( wdm ) with the sterile neutrino mass @xmath110 kev and mixing angle @xmath111 ( wdm1 ) .",

    "4 .   wdm with @xmath113 kev and @xmath114 ( wdm3 ) .",
    "the values of parameters chosen for these models are shown in fig.[fig : models ] .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "the choice of wdm1 is obvious because it satisfies all the constraints , including the x - ray bounds and the lyman - alpha bounds .",
    "the masses as large as @xmath110 kev can not be constrained by either chandra or xmm , and the best constraint comes from heao , which is weaker because of its lower energy resolution @xcite .",
    "also , wdm1 corresponds to a very small free - streaming length and , on large scales , it creates structure indistinguishable from cdm .",
    "the only difference between wdm1 and cdm is the additional x - ray flux .",
    "therefore , the comparison of cdm and wdm1 cases provides a clean test of the effects of the increased ionization fraction @xcite .",
    "also , wdm1 provides a realistic set of parameters consistent with all the bounds , as well as the pulsar kick mechanism due to resonant active - sterile neutrino conversions @xcite .",
    "wdm2 is also consistent with all the existing limits , including the most ambitious lyman - alpha bounds  @xcite .",
    "( we remind the reader that @xcite have obtained a 50% weaker limit using the same data . ) the x - ray background is lower in this case than in the case of wdm1 .",
    "finally , wdm3 corresponds to masses that would be ruled out by the `` strong '' lyman - alpha bounds obtained by  @xcite and by  @xcite .",
    "however , one has to remember that the relation between the masses and the free - streaming length depends on the production mechanism of sterile neutrinos .",
    "for example , the free - streaming length in the  @xcite production mechanism is different from the  @xcite mechanism . even within the latter framework ,",
    "additional entropy production can redshift the sterile neutrino momenta and eliminate the lyman - alpha bound  @xcite .",
    "if dark matter is produced from a coupling between the sterile neutrinos and the inflaton  @xcite , the free - streaming length is , again , different .",
    "wdm3 requires redshifting of the neutrino momenta by a factor @xmath115 , as compared to the thermal distribution .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by entropy production of the order of @xmath116 , which is comparable to the effect of change in the number of degrees of freedom from the electroweak scale to zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "hence , wdm3 should not be considered an unrealistic scenario .",
    "in addition , wdm3 is of interest because it is consistent with the pulsar kick mechanism via off - resonant active - sterile neutrino oscillations  @xcite , even if this sterile neutrino is not the dominant component of dark matter .",
    "the results of the calculation are presented in figures [ fig : t ] , [ fig : xe ] and [ fig : xh2 ] .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from these results .",
    "we find that large clouds , with masses greater than @xmath117 , collapse regardless of the details of cooling in all the models defined above .",
    "one could expect this behavior because the virial temperature of such a cloud is higher than @xmath12  k , so the h cooling mechanism is efficient enough and the additional h@xmath11 does not play an important role .",
    "there is , however , a dramatic difference when it comes to smaller clouds . for a virialization redshift @xmath118 ,",
    "a cloud of @xmath119 collapses in model wdm1 , but not in the cdm or other wdm models .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the increased h@xmath120 fraction on the cooling of gas .    in wdm2 and wdm3 model ,",
    "because of the relatively low associated x - ray flux , the temperature evolution is practically unaffected by the photons from the dark matter decay .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : xh2 ] one can draw another conclusion . in the large clouds ,",
    "all of the h@xmath11 molecules are destroyed during the virialization process .",
    "this is because of the very high virial temperature .",
    "in contrast , there is a drastic increase in h@xmath11 fraction during the virialization of the clouds with the mass of @xmath121 . in both cases ,",
    "most of molecular hydrogen is produced after virialization .",
    "for clouds with @xmath122 and @xmath123 the critical h@xmath11 fraction ( see eq .",
    "( 11 ) of @xcite ) is reached at virialization . on the other hand ,",
    "in the clouds having equivalent mass with @xmath118 , the molecular hydrogen faction @xmath106 attains its virial critical value only for wdm1 model .",
    "this happens at @xmath124 .    in all the wdm models the ionization and the molecular hydrogen fraction",
    "are enhanced in comparison with the cdm model , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can see that in wdm models the temperature of the collapsing clouds soon after virialization is lower then that in the cdm case , which speeds up the collapse , at least for the low - mass clouds .",
    "we note in passing that the density of the cloud was kept constant after virialization , so the evolution of @xmath52 , @xmath92 and @xmath106 is reliable for the redshifts close to virialization , but not for much smaller redshifts .",
    "it appears that wdm3 model is disfavored .",
    "the increase in the cooling rate is almost negligible in comparison with the cdm case , while the suppression on the small scales is very strong .",
    "therefore , this leads to an unacceptable delay in the onset of star formation , as discussed by @xcite .    in the case of wdm1 and wdm2 models ,",
    "the cooling is enhanced by the additional fraction of molecular hydrogen .",
    "however , we can not definitively prove that star formation occurs at the redshift consistent with wmap because of the simplifying assumptions and limitations of our analysis .",
    "the main limitation is that the virialization redshift of a particular cloud is a fixed parameter in the simulation . in reality , it can be changed by the enhancement of the cooling , so the cloud can reach its virial stage much earlier .",
    "moreover , the density of the cloud is kept constant after virialization , which is a simplifying assumption .",
    "we can not calculate the real redshift of the cloud collapse and onset of the star formation . as a result",
    ", we can not calculate how many clouds collapse at a given redshift and we can not calculate the redshift of reionization in wdm model reliably .",
    "also , we have not included the additional x - rays from the decay of sterile neutrinos inside the collapsing clump .",
    "this radiation can cause an additional increase in ionization and heating , which could change our results .",
    "also the effects of opacity can be important in large clouds , which we have not taken into account .",
    "these limitations will be addressed in the future work .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the cooling and collapse of primordial gas in the model with warm dark matter , taking into account both the increase in the fraction of molecular hydrogen  @xcite and the heating due to the sterile neutrino decay . as expected , the effect on the largest gas clouds is negligible , but the smaller clouds are , in fact affected .",
    "we have performed the analysis for some benchmark cases which arise in realistic scenarios . for the largest clouds , the additional molecular hydrogen made no difference . for smaller clouds , especially for those with masses",
    "@xmath125 , the increase in the x - ray background made the successful collapse possible in cases where it could not occur in the absence of sterile neutrino decays .",
