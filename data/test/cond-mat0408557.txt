    "complex systems have attracted much attention among physicists , applied mathematicians , engineers , and social scientists in recent years . in particular ,",
    "agent - based models have become an important part of research on complex adaptive systems @xcite .",
    "for example , self - organized phenomena in an evolving population consisting of agents competing for a limited resource , have potential applications in areas such as engineering , economics , biology , and social sciences @xcite .",
    "the bar - attendance problem proposed by arthur @xcite constitutes an everyday example of such a system in which a population of agents decide whether to go to a popular bar having limited seating capacity .",
    "the agents are informed of the attendance in past weeks , and hence share common information , make decisions based on past experience , interact through their actions , and in turn generate this common information collectively .",
    "these ingredients are key characteristics of complex systems @xcite .",
    "an important step in the recent explosion of research in agent - based models within the physics community , has been the introduction of binary ising - like versions of models of competing populations ",
    "examples include the minority game ( mg ) @xcite and the binary - agent - resource ( b - a - r ) game @xcite .    for modest resource levels in which there are more losers than winners , the minority game @xcite represents a simple , yet highly non - trivial , model that captures many of the essential features of such a competing population .",
    "it has been the subject of many theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the mg considers an odd number @xmath0 of agents . at each timestep",
    ", the agents independently decide between two options ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath4 ' .",
    "the winners are those who choose the minority option .",
    "the agents learn from past experience by evaluating the performance of their strategies , where each strategy maps the available global information , i.e. the record of the most recent @xmath5 winning options , to an action .",
    "one important quantity in the mg is the standard deviation @xmath6 of the number of agents making a particular choice .",
    "this quantity reflects the performance of the population as a whole in that a small @xmath6 implies on average more winners per turn , and hence a higher success rate per turn among the agents . in the mg",
    ", @xmath6 exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on the memory size @xmath5 of the agents @xcite .",
    "when @xmath5 is small , there is a significant overlap between the agents strategies .",
    "this crowd effect @xcite leads to a large @xmath6 , implying the number of losers is high .",
    "this is the crowded , or informationally efficient , phase of mg . in the informationally inefficient phase where @xmath5 is large ,",
    "@xmath6 is moderately small and the agents perform better than if they were to decide their actions randomly . in this regime ,",
    "information is left in the resulting bit - string patterns for a single realization of the system . in the inefficient phase",
    ", the mg can be mapped on to disordered spin systems and hence the machinery in statistical physics of disordered systems , most noticeably the replica trick , can be applied @xcite .",
    "however , the replica trick becomes ineffective in the efficient phase .",
    "the crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite gives a physically transparent , quantitative theory of the observed features of the mg in both the efficient and inefficient regimes .",
    "the crowd - anticrowd theory is based on the fact that it is the difference in the numbers of agents playing a given strategy @xmath7 and the corresponding anti - correlated strategy @xmath8 , that dictates the size of the fluctuations and hence performance of the population as a whole .    in agent - based models ,",
    "the non - triviality of the results comes from the actions taken by the agents which are directly related to the decision mechanism .",
    "the decision mechanism depends sensitively on how each strategy performs at the moment of decision . in the efficient phase of the mg ,",
    "no strategy outperforms the others and therefore the relative performance of the strategies oscillates as the game proceeds .",
    "this anti - persistent nature of the strategy performance @xcite is crucial in arriving at a quantitative understanding of the mg s dynamics .",
    "as the systems evolves , it goes from one @xmath5-bit outcome or history bit - string to another .",
    "mathematically , the evolution can be viewed in terms of transitions in the global information ( i.e. history ) space .",
    "the @xmath9 possible history bit - strings for a given value of @xmath5 constitute the nodes in this history space .",
    "as the system evolves , it makes transitions from one node to another .",
    "_ showed that in the efficient ( i.e. low @xmath5 ) phase of the mg , an effective restoring force dominates the strategy - score dynamics yielding a eulerian trail quasi - attractor in history space @xcite .",
    "as @xmath5 increases , a competing bias term  associated with the initial strategy allocation  becomes increasingly important and eventually leads to instability of the eulerian trail quasi - attractor @xcite .",
    "johnson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite subsequently introduced and studied numerically what is known as the binary - agent - resource ( b - a - r ) model , in which the winning group is not necessarily decided by the minority rule .",
    "the b - a - r model features a cutoff parameter @xmath2 , which is referred to as the global resource level @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 are not known to the agents . at each timestep @xmath11 , each agent decides upon two possible options : whether to access the resource or not .",
    "the winning action is decided by whether the number of agents attempting to access the resource , actually exceeds this resource level .",
    "the mg therefore corresponds to the particular case of @xmath12 in the b - a - r model . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was found numerically that the population may unwittingly self - segregate itself into groups if @xmath2 deviates sufficiently from @xmath13 . as an example , consider a very high resource level of @xmath14 with each agent holding two strategies : it was found numerically that approximately @xmath15 agents are persistent winners while the rest are persistent losers .    in the present work",
    "we analyze , both numerically and analytically , the transition from modest to high resources in this generic b - a - r model of a competing multi - agent population .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the system exhibits a set of abrupt transitions between distinct yet well - defined states as the resource level @xmath2 increases from @xmath13 to @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , both the highest success rate @xmath16 and the mean success rate @xmath17 among the agents , show abrupt transitions as @xmath2 varies .",
    "in addition , @xmath16 exhibits _ fractional _ values in the plateau regions between each transition .",
    "we show that this behavior can be understood in terms of the system s trajectory in the history space as time evolves . in particular , as @xmath2 increases , the portion of the history space that the system visits becomes increasingly restricted .",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the observed plateaux values and the values of @xmath2 at which the transitions occur .",
    "although the present analysis focuses on a non - networked population , the same elements of ( i ) strategy performance over time , and hence the dynamics of strategy scores , plus ( ii ) the system s trajectory in history space , provide the foundation for a quantitative understanding of a large class of agent - based models , including networked populations @xcite .",
    "we also note that for physicists interested in random walks , the present b - a - r system provides a fascinating laboratory for studying correlated , non - markovian diffusion on a non - trivial network ( i.e. the history space , which corresponds to a de bruijn graph ) .",
    "this non - trivial diffusion is in turn strongly coupled to the non - random temporal patterns arising in the strategy - performance dynamics . finally , we note in passing that the occurrence of abrupt transitions between plateau states , and stable fractions , are known to arise in a multi - electron quantum system as the external magnetic field is increased monotonically ( i.e. fractional quantum hall effect @xcite ) .",
    "however it is very curious to see such ` quantized ' phenomena arise in a classical multi - particle system as a function of a monotonically increasing external control parameter .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the b - a - r model . in sec .",
    "iii , we present numerical results from extensive simulations .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the existence of different phases or states at different values of the resource level . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss how the strategies performance evolves as the system evolves . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the history space of the b - a - r model and present results for the statistics in the outcome bit - strings at high resource levels . in sec .",
    "vi , we explain the observed numerical features based on the idea that at high resource levels , the system restricts itself to only visit a restricted portion of the history space .",
    "we derive an expression for the highest success rate @xmath16 among the agents and discuss the critical values of resource level at which transitions occur .",
    "we summarize the results in sec .",
    "vii , together with a discussion of how the present approach can be generalized to a wider class of agent - based models .",
    "we consider the binary - agent - resource ( b - a - r ) model @xcite .",
    "the b - a - r model is a binary version of arthur s el farol bar attendance model @xcite , in which a population of agents repeatedly decide whether to go to a bar with limited seating based on the information of the crowd size in recent weeks . in the b - a - r model",
    ", there is a global resource level @xmath2 which is not announced to the agents , where @xmath0 is the total number of agents . at each timestep @xmath11",
    ", each agent decides upon two possible options : whether to access resource @xmath2 ( action ` 1 ' ) or not ( action ` 0 ' ) .",
    "the two global outcomes at each timestep , ` resource over - used ' and ` resource not over - used ' , are denoted by ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath4 ' . if the number of agents @xmath18 choosing action @xmath4 exceeds @xmath2 ( i.e. resource over - used and hence global outcome ` @xmath3 ' ) then the @xmath19 abstaining agents win .",
    "by contrast if @xmath20 ( i.e. resource not over - used and hence global outcome ` @xmath4 ' ) then the @xmath18 agents win . in order to investigate the behavior of the system as @xmath2 changes , it is sufficient to study the range @xmath21 .",
    "the results for the range @xmath22 can be obtained from those in the present work by suitably interchanging the role of ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' @xcite . in the special case of @xmath23 ,",
    "the b - a - r model reduces to the minority game .    in the b - a - r model",
    ", each agent shares a common knowledge of the past history of the most recent @xmath5 outcomes , i.e. the winning option in the most recent @xmath5 timesteps .",
    "the full strategy space thus consists of @xmath24 strategies , as in the mg .",
    "initially , each agent randomly picks @xmath25 strategies from the pool of strategies , with repetitions allowed .",
    "the agents use these strategies throughout the game . at each timestep",
    ", each agent uses his momentarily best performing strategy with the highest virtual points .",
    "the virtual points for each strategy indicate the cumulative performance of that strategy : at each timestep , one virtual point ( vp ) is awarded ( deducted ) to ( from ) a strategy that would have predicted the correct ( incorrect ) outcome after all decisions have been made . a random coin - toss is used to break ties between strategies . in the b - a - r model , the population may or may not contain network connections . in the case of a networked population",
    "@xcite each agent has access to additional information from his connected neighbors , such as his neighbors strategies and/or performance . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the b - a - r model with a non - networked population .    to evaluate the performance of an agent , one ( real ) point is awarded to each winning agent at a given timestep .",
    "a maximum of @xmath2 points per turn can therefore be awarded to the agents .",
    "an agent has a success rate @xmath26 , which is the mean number of points awarded to the agent per turn over a long time window . the mean success rate @xmath27 among the agents is then defined to be the mean number of points awarded per agent per turn , i.e. an average of @xmath26 over the agents .",
    "we are interested in investigating the details of how the success rate changes as the resource level @xmath2 varies in the efficient phase , where the number of strategies ( repetitions counted ) in play is larger than the total number of distinct strategies in the strategy space .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath2 were first reported by johnson _ et al .",
    "these authors studied numerically the dependence of the fluctuations in the number of agents taking a particular option , on the memory size @xmath5 for different values of @xmath2 . for the mg ( i.e. @xmath23 ) in the efficient phase ( i.e. small values of @xmath5 ) the number of agents making a particular choice varies from timestep to timestep , with additional stochasticity introduced via the random tie - breaking process .",
    "the corresponding period depends on the memory length @xmath5 .",
    "the underlying reason is that in the efficient phase for @xmath12 , no strategy is better overall than any other .",
    "hence there is a tendency for the system to restore itself after a finite number of timesteps , thereby preventing a given strategy s vps from running away from the others . as a result ,",
    "the outcome bit - string shows the feature of anti - persistency or double periodicity @xcite . since a maximum of @xmath12 points",
    "can be awarded per turn , the mean success rate @xmath27 over a sufficiently large number of timesteps is bound from above by @xmath28 .    in the b - a - r system with high resource level",
    ", the mean success rate behaves differently . taking the extreme case of @xmath29 ,",
    "the winning action is obviously ` 1 ' ( i.e. access resource ) and in principle every agent could win in every timestep .",
    "the history upon which the agents decide , is persistently @xmath5-bits of ` 1 ' .",
    "however , due to the random initial strategy distribution , some agents may not hold a strategy that predicts the winning option for a history of @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath4 s .",
    "therefore , there are still losers and @xmath27 is less than @xmath2 .",
    "the number of losers depends on @xmath25 , the number of strategies that each agent holds . for @xmath30 and assuming that the strategies are picked randomly , a mean number of @xmath31 agents in a large population will hold two strategies both predicting the wrong option . the mean success rate is thus given by @xmath32 .",
    "we have carried out extensive numerical simulations on the b - a - r model to investigate the dependence of the success rate on @xmath2 for @xmath21 . unless stated otherwise , we consider systems with @xmath33 agents and @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure1](a ) shows the results of the mean success rate ( dark solid line ) as a function of @xmath2 in a typical run for @xmath34 , together with the range corresponding to one standard deviation about @xmath17 in the success rates among the @xmath0 agents ( dotted lines ) and the spread in the success rates given by the highest and the lowest success rates ( thin solid lines ) in the population . by taking a larger value of @xmath0 than most studies in the literature",
    ", we can analyze the dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath5 in great detail .",
    "in particular , these quantities all exhibit abrupt transitions ( i.e. jumps ) at particular values of @xmath2 . between the jumps , the quantities remain essentially constant and hence form steps or ` plateaux ' .",
    "we refer to these different plateaux as states or phases , since it turns out that the jump occurs when the system makes a transition from one type of state characterizing the outcome bit - string to another . for different runs ,",
    "the results are almost identical . at most , there are tiny shifts in the @xmath2 values at which jumps arise due to ( i ) different initial strategy distributions among the agents in different runs , and ( ii ) different random initial history bit - strings used to start the runs .",
    "these different states are most clearly seen by monitoring the _ highest _ success rate @xmath16 among the agents for given values of @xmath2 and @xmath5 . the most striking feature in fig.[fig : figure1](a )",
    "is that the values of the plateaux in @xmath16 are given by _ simple fractions _ , e.g. @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , etc .",
    "this feature strongly suggests that the system goes through different states with different ratios of ` @xmath4 ' and ` @xmath3 ' in the outcome bit - string as @xmath2 varies , as will be discussed in later sections .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure1](b ) shows that the features in the success rates for the simpler case of @xmath40 are similar to those in fig.[fig : figure1](a ) , except that the plateaux in @xmath16 take on fewer values , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "these values are closely related to the statistics in the outcome bit - string . for large @xmath0 and @xmath40 ,",
    "the outcome bit - string shows a period of 4 bits . for values of @xmath2 with @xmath42",
    ", it turns out that the fraction of the outcome ` @xmath4 ' in a period is exactly @xmath39 . for the range of @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath43 , there are three @xmath4 s in a period of @xmath44 , and so on . for @xmath34 ,",
    "we have also carried out detailed analysis of the outcome bit - string .",
    "for later discussions , we summarize in table [ tab : otsm3s2 ] the values of @xmath16 , the range of @xmath2 corresponding to the observed value of @xmath16 , the ratio of number of occurrence of ` 1'-bits to ` 0'-bits and the period in the outcome bit - string , as obtained numerically from the data shown in fig.[fig : figure1 ] .",
    "hereafter , @xmath16 is used to label the state at a given @xmath2 .",
    "the agents decide based on the best performing strategy that they hold at the moment of their decision .",
    "a strategy s performance is evaluated by its virtual points , which vary as the game proceeds .",
    "it is most illustrative to consider the case of @xmath40 and @xmath30 ( see fig.[fig : figure1](b ) ) since one can readily follow the dynamics for different values of @xmath2 . for @xmath40 , there are only four different strategies in the whole strategy space",
    ". these strategies can be represented by ( @xmath45 ) , ( @xmath46 ) , ( @xmath47 ) , and ( @xmath48 ) , with the first ( second ) index in ( @xmath49 ) giving the action for the history bit - string of ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath4 ' , respectively .",
    "the virtual points ( vp ) of the four strategies can then be represented by a @xmath50 matrix vp@xmath51 , with the @xmath49-element giving the vp of the strategy ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : strgevom1s2 ] shows the time evolution of the vps of the strategies in a few timesteps , the number of agents @xmath52 taking the action ` 1 ' , and the outcome for @xmath40 in a population with _",
    "uniform _ initial distribution of all possible pairs of strategies to the agents .",
    "we illustrate these ideas by considering the case of an initial history of ` 0 ' for given @xmath2 , but the same results are obtained for an initial history of ` 1 ' . for @xmath53 , the system follows the dynamics shown in the left column . in this range of @xmath2 ,",
    "the vps can not run away due to the decision making process of the agents .",
    "the vps restore their values in a few timesteps , as in the mg . for systems of large @xmath0",
    ", the outcome series shows a 4-bit periodic pattern of @xmath54 , with @xmath55 in agreement with the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](b ) .",
    "this highest success rate is achieved by the agents who hold two identical strategies .",
    "the result also implies that an agent s success rate is determined by the hamming distance between the two strategies that the agent holds @xcite .",
    "one could therefore say that different ` species ' of agent emerge in the population due to the dynamics of the system , with each species characterized by its own hamming distance ` gene ' .    for @xmath56 , two of the four strategies will have runaway vps , with one tending to increase without bound while another tends to decrease without bound ( see central column in table  [ tab : strgevom1s2 ] ) . following the dynamics",
    ", the outcome series shows a 4-bit periodic pattern of @xmath57 , in the limit of large @xmath0 . in this range , @xmath43",
    "as observed numerically and this value is achieved by those agents holding the strategy whose vps increase without bound . for @xmath58 ,",
    "two strategies have their vps increasing ( decreasing ) without bound ( see right column in table  [ tab : strgevom1s2 ] ) .",
    "the outcome series is persistently ` @xmath4 ' , i.e. it becomes effectively period-1 . in this high resource level regime , @xmath32 since three - quarters of the agents",
    "hold at least one strategy which predicts the persistently winning option . in this way , it is possible to follow the dynamics of the system and obtain the number of possible states and the range of @xmath2 for each state .",
    "table  [ tab : wrm1s2 ] summarizes the theoretical results for @xmath40 and @xmath30 , by following the analysis on the dynamics as shown in table  [ tab : strgevom1s2 ] .",
    "the results for the location of the transitions , the values of @xmath27 and @xmath16 are all in good agreement with numerical data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](b ) ) .",
    "the important point is that for small @xmath5 , the system undergoes several changes of state with successively higher values of @xmath27 and @xmath16 as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is related to the ratio of occurrences of the two possible outcomes in the outcome series , which in turn is related to the strategies performance and thus the decision - making process for a given value of @xmath2 .    we have carried out similar analysis for the case of @xmath59 and @xmath34 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the fraction of ` @xmath4 ' in a period is found to take on values in the set @xmath60 , which coincides with the numerical values of @xmath16 obtained by numerical simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figure1](a ) ) and shown in table  [ tab : otsm3s2 ] .",
    "however , the analysis becomes increasingly complicated for higher values of @xmath5 and/or @xmath25 .",
    "the reason is that there are @xmath61 strategies , and allowing @xmath25 strategies per agent divides the agents into @xmath62 groups according to the sequence in which an agent picks his @xmath25 strategies .",
    "this number increases rapidly with @xmath5 and @xmath25 , and the above microscopic analysis becomes hard to implement .",
    "it turns out the states are closely related to the way in which the system explores the possible histories . in what follows",
    ", we analyze the b - a - r model by an approach that focuses on the transitions between history bit - strings and hence on the path in the history space @xcite .",
    "our approach couples together consideration of the probability of the occurrence of various histories and the ranking in the performance of the strategies @xcite .",
    "the history space consists of all the possible history bit - strings for a given value of @xmath5 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "it includes @xmath63 bit - strings of @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure2](a ) shows the history space for @xmath34 , together with the possible transitions from one history to another .",
    "each history constitutes a node in the history space .",
    "the transitions are marked by arrows together with the outcome necessary for making the transitions .",
    "it will prove convenient to group the possible history bit - strings for a given @xmath5 into columns , in the way shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2](a ) .",
    "each column is labelled by a parameter @xmath64 , which is the number of ",
    "s in the @xmath65-bit history ( histories ) concerned . one immediate advantage of this labelling scheme is that the different states characterized by @xmath16 turn out to involve paths in a _ restricted _ portion of the full history space .",
    "for example , the state with @xmath66 is restricted to the @xmath67 portion of the history space , i.e. the @xmath68 history bit - string leads to an outcome of ` 1 ' and hence persistent self - looping at the node @xmath68 in history space .",
    "the states with @xmath69 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 correspond to different paths in the history space restricted to the @xmath70 and @xmath71 groups of histories , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2](b ) .",
    "the states with @xmath72 and @xmath38 have paths extended to include @xmath73 histories .",
    "the state with @xmath74 has paths that cover the whole history space ( @xmath75 ) . in general ,",
    "the deviation of @xmath2 from @xmath13 acts like a driving force in the history space that drifts the system towards an increasingly restrictive portion of the history space bounded by a smaller value of @xmath64 .",
    "one can also view this behavior as the system , in response to the global resource level @xmath2 , effectively avoiding certain nodes in the history space and hence avoiding particular patterns of historical outcomes .",
    "as the game proceeds , the system evolves from one history bit - string to another .",
    "this can be regarded as transitions between different nodes ( i.e. different histories ) in the history space . for @xmath12 in the efficient phase",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that the conditional probability of an outcome of , say , ` @xmath4 ' following a given history is the same for all histories . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the result still holds for states characterized by @xmath74 . note that a history bit - string can only make transitions to history bit - strings that differ by the most recent outcome , e.g. 111 can only be make transitions to either 110 or 111 , and thus many transitions between two nodes in the history space are forbidden .",
    "in addition , these allowed transitions do not in general occur with equal probabilities .",
    "this leads to specific outcome ( and history ) bit - string statistics for a state characterized by @xmath16 .",
    "we have carried out detailed analysis of the statistics of the outcomes following a given history bit - string for @xmath34 , and for each of the possible states over the whole range of @xmath2 .",
    "table  [ tab : tmm3 ] gives the relative numbers of occurrences of each outcome for every history bit - string .",
    "for the state with @xmath77 , for example , the outcomes ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath4 ' occur with equal probability for every history bit - string , as in the mg .",
    "for the other states , the results reveal several striking features .",
    "it turns out that @xmath16 is given by the _ relative frequency _ of an outcome of ` @xmath4 ' in the outcome bit - string , which in turn is governed by the resource level @xmath2 . for example",
    ", a ` 0 ' to ` 1 ' ratio of @xmath78 in the outcome bit - strings corresponds to the state with @xmath79 . in table",
    "[ tab : tmm3 ] , we have intentionally grouped the history bit - strings into rows according to the label @xmath64 in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure2 ] .",
    "we immediately notice that for every possible state in the b - a - r model , the relative frequency of each outcome is a property of the _ group _ of histories having the same label @xmath64 rather than the individual history bit - string , i.e. all histories in a group have the same relative fraction of a given outcome .",
    "this observation is important in understanding the dynamics in the history space for different states in that it is no longer necessary to consider each of the @xmath9 history bit - strings in the history space .",
    "instead , it is sufficient to consider the four groups of histories ( for @xmath34 ) as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure2](a ) .",
    "analysis of results for higher values of @xmath5 show the same feature .    for the state characterized by @xmath66 , the outcome bit - string is persistently `",
    "@xmath4 ' and the path in the history space is repeatedly 111@xmath801 .",
    "therefore , the path is restricted to the history labelled by @xmath70 and simply corresponds to an infinite number of loops around the history node 111 .",
    "since there is no ` @xmath3 ' in the outcome bit - string , we will also refer to this state as @xmath81 state .",
    "the system is effectively frozen into one node in the history space . in this case",
    ", there are effectively only two kinds of strategies , which differ by their predictions for the history 111 .",
    "the difference in predictions for the other ( @xmath82 ) history bit - strings become irrelevant . obviously , the ranking in the performance of the two effective groups of strategies is such that the group of strategies that suggest an action ` 1 ' for the history ` 111 ' , outperforms the group that suggests an action ` 0 ' . for a uniform initial distribution of strategies ,",
    "there are @xmath83 agents taking the action 0 and @xmath84 agents taking the action ` 1 ' , since half of the strategies predict 0 and half of them predict 1 . to sustain a winning outcome of ` 1 '",
    ", the criterion is that the resource level @xmath2 should be higher than the number of agents taking the action ` 1 ' .",
    "therefore , we have for the state with @xmath85 that @xmath86 and @xmath87 these results are in agreement with the results obtained by numerical simulations . for @xmath30 , @xmath88 for @xmath58 .",
    "note that equations   and are valid for _ any _ values of @xmath5 .",

    "more generally , we found that different states correspond to different paths covering a subspace within the whole history space . in the high resource level regime , namely @xmath184 , @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding path in the history space is one that loops around the history ` 111 ... ' indefinitely . just below the high resource level regime",

    "the system explores the whole history space by passing through trails that are almost eulerian @xcite .",
    "the random initial distribution of strategies and the random initial history bit - string that started the system , provide the seed for the diffusive behavior which develops in the history space as the system evolves .",
    "in fact , results of numerical simulations for @xmath187 show that slightly increasing @xmath2 beyond @xmath13 has the effect of suppressing this random wandering through the history space , and instead locks the system into the eulerian trail . however opposing mechanisms can arise to counteract this driving force , thereby enhancing the diffusive behavior .",
    "for example , this can be achieved by allowing the agents the chance of using a strategy besides the best - performing one @xcite or by allowing some agents to opt out of the system occasionally @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the system can be biased through the initial strategy scores , or by introducing a specially prepared non - random initial allocation of strategies @xcite .",

    "the present b - a - r system provides a fascinating laboratory for studying correlated , non - markovian diffusion on a non - trivial network ( i.e. history space ) .",

    "we note that the present results could also be used to generalize the crowd - anticrowd theory in order to incorporate the effect of restricted history - space dynamics : this would then allow identification of an appropriate set of correlated , uncorrelated and anti - correlated strategies in order to implement the crowd - anticrowd theoretical expressions .    as a side - product ,",
