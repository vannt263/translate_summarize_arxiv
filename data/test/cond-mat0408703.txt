    "for example , it is natural to expect the fermi surface to be flat in the stripe phase in the anti - nodal region , near the vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . in addition",
    ", quasi - one - dimensionality of the system should bring about the depletion of spectral weight in the nodal regions , near the brillouin zone diagonals .",
    "much research has been done to check if these hypotheses are true @xcite .",
    "it seems that some general structure of spectra may be definitely attributed to an underlying quasi - one dimensional electronic structure @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on doped @xmath4 ( lsco ) compounds , slightly above the doping level @xmath5 at which , it is believed , a tendency towards nanoscale phase separation seems to be evident in the the arpes results @xcite . in arpes intensity maps obtained by integrating over 30 @xmath6 at the fermi energy the spectra from 15% doped @xmath7 ( nd - lsco ) @xcite , patches with high intensity may be seen in anti - nodal regions .",
    "appreciable spectral weight is also detected at the fermi energy in nodal regions .",
    "a similar pattern of the spectral density at the fermi energy was predicted by a phenomenological theory of disordered charge stripes and anti - phase spin domains @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this theory does not discuss the origin of renormalized hopping terms in the effective one - body hamiltonian and does not explain the relation of this renormalization with the underlying magnetic structure .",
    "the evolution of the spectral weight as a function of doping has been analyzed for the stripe phase by means of the cluster perturbation technique ( cpt ) in the framework of the microscopic @xmath8-@xmath9 and hubbard models @xcite .",
    "this theory captures quite well the general trend of this development .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the spectral weight maps derived within this approach for the doping level at and above 12.5% do not show continuous well developed high - intensity straight patches bridging anti - nodal regions .",

    "in addition , that theory does not provide us with much information about the magnetic structure of stripes .",

    "the spreading of the quasiparticle - peaks in the single - particle spectrum obtained by means of the exact diagonalization is in good agreement with results of an additional calculation performed by means of a different method which is the bond operator theory for the spin - peierls phase .",
    "unfortunately , neither the numerical approach nor the analytical method reproduce the flattening of the experimental band near the point @xmath14 and both of them fail to explain the emergence of the spectral weight at the nodal region , in the form of a straight patch which is observed at the fermi energy in the experiments .",
    "another analysis of the spectral weight in doped afs , based on the exact diagonalization of a small cluster concerns the @xmath10 m with inhomogeneous terms locally breaking the translational invariance and the spin - rotational su(2 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the pattern of the spectral weight at the fermi energy obtained by means of this method resembles arpes spectra from nd - lsco at the doping level @xmath15 and does not show enhanced intensity at nodal regions .",
    "this enhancement observed in experiments is the manifestation of remnant two - dimensionality ( 2d ) in the stripe system .",
    "thus , also this theory seems not account for the shape of arpes spectra from nd - lsco or lsco at the doping level slightly higher than @xmath5 .",
    "results of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments indicate that pronounced af correlations exist in the stripe phase @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the relevance of bond - order has been recently demonstrated by means of the same experimental method @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have suggested that the coexistence of bond - order with long range af order may take place in the stripe phase .",

    "in addition it is also known about the site - centered stripe that it is more stable than a homogeneous system of holes created in the homogeneous af @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of coexistence between af order and spin - peierls order in the stripe phase is based on lowering the kinetic energy of holes moving without confinement in hole - rich stripes which are formed in the form of two - leg ladder - like domain walls ( dws ) between af hole - poor domains in which the exchange energy decreases @xcite .    in the next section , in the framework of a scenario for nanoscale phase separation and coexistence of af long range order with bond - order",
    ", we will derive an effective tight - binding hamiltonian describing a quasiparticle propagating in such a spin background .",
    "next we will calculate the part of the spectral function which is accessible to measurements in photoemission experiments .",

    "a natural question arises , what is mechanism which gives rise to long range af correlations , if af domains are separated by dws which consist of singlets ?",
    "the structure depicted in fig.[fig1 ] emerges in the presence of holes only .",

    "the creation of a hole gives rise to appearance of an uncompensated spin in the dw .",
    "this spin may be parallel or antiparallel to a nearest spin in the neighbor domain .",

    "some quantum fluctuations will be present in the underlying spin background of the stripe system .",
    "they may take the form of triplet excitations on bonds in dws and multimagnon excitations in domains .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] in the previous work @xcite contains some examples of quantum fluctuations in the spin background .",
    "they contribute a lot to the energy of the system . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that quantum fluctuations merely renormalize the shape of quasiparticle dispersion for a given spin background and do not change the picture qualitatively .",
    "this has been demonstrated in the case of a hole propagating in the af spin background @xcite , as well as in the case of bond ordered two - leg ladders @xcite and bond - ordered 2d systems @xcite .",
    "when it is necessary we will take into account the influence of quantum fluctuations on the distribution of spectral weight . a scenario which underlies the calculation which we are going to outline next ,",
    "is based on the assumption that hole motion inside ladder - like dws is governed by the exchange of positions between a hole - fermion pair on a bond and a singlet on a nearby bond @xcite .",
    "this exchange is mediated by the hopping terms in the initial hamiltonian ( [ hamorg ] ) .",

    "a hole created and moving in the nel background shifts spins between different sublattices and creates defects in the af structure , fig.[fig3 ] ( a)-(c ) .",
    "such a process gives rise to an increase of the ising energy .",
