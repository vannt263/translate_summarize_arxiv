    "building on the advances of laser technology , strong - field physics and attosecond science  @xcite have attracted a lot of attention as means to manipulate and probe the electronic structure at the atomic and molecular level  @xcite . among the variety of possible outcomes from the laser - matter interaction , high harmonic generation ( hhg )  @xcite focuses on the highly nonlinear and non - perturbative process by which coherent harmonic photons of the driving laser are emitted , with harmonic orders ranging up to the extreme ultraviolet regime  @xcite . in turn",
    ", the intrinsic coherence of the hhg process can be exploited in the development of novel high performance light sources such as attosecond pulses  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , by the fundamental properties of the hhg process , information on electronic structure and electron dynamics are encoded in the spectrum  @xcite , opening the way for high harmonic spectroscopy .    at the core of strong - field physics",
    "is the recollision picture  @xcite in which an electron , after being ionized , is accelerated and returned to its parent ion upon reversal of the electric field direction . upon recollision , electromagnetic radiation can be emitted therefore corresponding to hhg .",
    "following the decomposition of the process into three successive steps , one can intuitively expect the hhg cross section to factorize into the product of each individual step , as @xmath0 the ionization probability times @xmath1 the propagation , through the probability of recollision , times @xmath2 the efficiency of rescattering .",
    "such a factorization has been expressed in the temporal domain for atoms  @xcite and was extended to include more complicated core dynamics of molecular systems  @xcite .",
    "less intuitively , the quantitative rescattering ( qsr ) model has empirically shown that this factorization of the hhg spectrum can be expressed directly in the frequency domain , with results in very good agreement with full quantum simulations and experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "the theory for such a spectral factorization has been established for short range potentials  @xcite . in this general context",
    ", we introduce a semi - classical wavefunction ( scwf ) formalism which , by combining the wave / particle picture of the electron , leads to an intuitive derivation of the hhg spectrum factorizations , irrespective of the potential .    in most theoretical analyses and interpretations of hhg ,",
    "two main approaches have been considered in the literature . on the one hand , the plane wave / volkov state ( or further refined",
    "coulomb corrected models )  @xcite adopt a wave perspective of the recolliding electron .",
    "such an approach allows one to define the recollision dipole element  [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum ] ) ] .",
    "however , since the electronic wavefunction is completely delocalized in configuration space , at all times the ionized part of the wavefunction overlaps completely with the bound part and the instant of recollision , i.e. , step @xmath2 in the recollision picture , has to be imposed by hand . on the other hand , classical ( or semi - classical ) interpretations that make use of electronic trajectories  @xcite , e.g. , using the stationary phase approximation ,",

    "we introduce a semi - classical wavefunction that combines the wave / particle pictures with a quantum - like delocalized wavefunction supported by a trajectory in phase space .",
    "these combined perspectives allow us to overcome the aforementioned difficulties and naturally define the dipole signal associated with recollision .",

    "the strong field ionization process has drawn a lot of attention in the adiabatic regime and beyond from the seminal works of keldysh  @xcite , perelomov - popov - terentev  @xcite and ammosov - delone - krainov  @xcite to tdse numerical approaches  @xcite . generally speaking",
    ", these theories predict the electron , after exiting the ionization barrier at time @xmath32 , to exhibit a gaussian distribution in momentum , generally centered around @xmath36 for linear polarization . moving the momentum distribution picture into configuration space",
    ", we take the initial ionized part of the wavefunction as a gaussian profile . for the subsequent dynamics ,",
    "the scwf approximation consists of two main hypotheses .",
    "( 1 )  we assume that the spatial profile remains gaussian , with a time - dependent maximum @xmath37 and width @xmath38 . following the maximum of the gaussian then gives rise to a classical trajectory in phase space , with position and momentum @xmath37 and @xmath39 , respectively .",

    "insightful electron trajectory pictures have been developed for the interpretation of hhg spectra , for instance the well - known short and long trajectories with linearly polarized lasers  @xcite . in this section",

    "[ fig : scattering_cross_section ] for the latter ) . from this perspective , the variations of the propagation factor can be neglected and the trajectory contribution is reduced to @xmath142    for simplicity , we use the sfa to compute the scwf trajectory component  although as discussed in section  [ sec : scwf : trajectory ] , a more refined model including the effects of the potential could also be considered . in the upper panel of fig .",

    "this can be easily understood with the fact that long trajectories are born around the maxima of the electric field ",
    "therefore with the higher ionization rate in the adiabatic approximation  while short trajectories are initiated later on , when the instantaneous field is weaker . more generally note that , for a given harmonic energy , in the factorization framework we have developed here , both short and long ( and multiple recollision ) trajectories share the same rescattering cross section . as a consequence ,",

    "( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : direct_factorization ] ) and  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) .    compared to the reference system version ,",
    "the direct factorization bypasses the computation of a quantum hhg spectrum altogether . beyond this kind of computational considerations , and",
    "more interestingly , the direct factorization offers an intuitive interpretation of spectra in terms of electron trajectories and allows to disentangle their respective contributions to the spectrum .",
    "this separation is essential in experimental measurements and models including macroscopic propagation of the hhg field where typical phase matching conditions restrict the contribution to a given harmonics from ( at most ) a single identified trajectory  @xcite . in this context the individual spectra of isolated systems ,",
    "as provided with the reference system factorization , are quite different from the macroscopic counterpart as it lacks the filtering imposed on trajectories that are not phase matched .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced the semi - classical wavefunction ( scwf ) approximation which combines the wave / particle picture of the electron dynamics : it is supported by a semi - classical trajectory while incorporating a spatially delocalized extension of the wavefunction .",
    "this intuitive framework , applied to high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) allows the factorization of the spectrum as the product of the ionization  @xmath0 , propagation  @xmath1 and rescattering  @xmath2 cross - sections in energy ( frequency ) space .",
    "the propagation component can be described with a reference system  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : reference_atom : factorization ] ) as in the quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the factorization can be performed directly using the trajectory perspective of the scwf  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : direct_factorization ] ) and  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum : trajectory_contribution ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : angle_resolved_spectrum ] , we compare the accuracy of the two factorizations ( middle and lower panels ) in approximating the full quantum spectra ( upper panels ) .",
    "more specifically , we display the intensity of odd harmonics ( which gives the global envelope of the harmonic comb ) between @xmath143 and @xmath144 energy , as the polarization angle @xmath12 is varied for the @xmath28 molecule ( left panels ) and @xmath27 molecular ion ( right ) models of potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , we see that both factorizations reproduce full quantum results very well . in particular",
    ", we see that all three panels present very similar oscillations patterns in photon energy and , as the polarization direction is varied , they all exhibit a local minimum that follows the singularity in the scattering cross - section ( see black curves in the panels ) .",
    "for both factorizations though , we see that this local minimum is sharper than in the full quantum computation counterparts .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that in full quantum simulations , the scattering cross - section is expressed in the temporal domain as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : complex_dipole : factorization ] ) while it is directly expressed in the frequency domain for the factorization . in the former case",
    ", the singularity can be blurred by higher order effects when computing the fourier transform to compute the hhg spectrum  ( [ eq : hhg_spectrum ] ) . on the quantitative level , in fig .  [",
    "fig : angle_resolved_spectrum ] , we observe better results using the reference system ( middle panels ) than with the direct factorization with sfa ( lower ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : hhg_factorization ] , we attribute this to the fact that the reference includes long - range coulomb corrections to the electron dynamics away from the core whereas when choosing the sfa in the direct factorization we ignore such effects altogether .        beyond the results of the factorization derived in this article ,",
    "the scwf allows the identification of possible perspectives for improving the results of approximate predictions compared to full quantum simulations . for the reference system of eq .",
