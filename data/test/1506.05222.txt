    "spite of common belief , recently conducted channel measurements have shown that millimeter wave ( mmwave ) frequencies may be suitable for cellular communications , provided that the cell radius is of the order of 100 - 200 meters @xcite .",
    "based on these measurements , the authors of @xcite have recently studied system - level performance of mmwave cellular networks and have compared them against conventional micro wave ( @xmath0wave ) cellular networks .",
    "the results have highlighted that mmwave cellular communications may outperform @xmath0wave cellular communications , by assuming similar cellular network densities , provided that a sufficient beamforming gain is guaranteed between base stations ( bss ) and mobile terminals ( mts ) .",
    "these preliminary but encouraging results have motivated several researchers to investigate potential and challenges of mmwave cellular communications for wireless access , in light of the large and unused bandwidth that is available at these frequencies .",
    "system - level performance evaluation of cellular networks is widely recognized to be a mathematically intractable problem @xcite , due to the lack of tractable approaches for modeling the other - cell interference . only recently",
    ", a new mathematical methodology has gained prominence due to its analytical tractability and reasonable accuracy compared to currently deployed cellular networks .",
    "this emerging approach exploits results from stochastic geometry and relies upon modeling the locations of the bss as points of a point process @xcite .",
    "usually , the poisson point process ( ppp ) is used due to its mathematical tractability @xcite .",
    "recent results for cellular networks modeling based on stochastic geometry are available in @xcite-@xcite , to which the reader is referred for further information .    motivated by the mathematical flexibility of the ppp - based abstraction modeling",
    ", researchers have recently tried to study the performance of mmwave cellular communications with the aid of stochastic geometry , by developing new frameworks specifically tailored to account for the peculiarities of mmwave propagation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mathematical frameworks currently available for modeling @xmath0wave cellular networks are not directly applicable to mmwave cellular networks .",
    "the main reasons are related to the need of incorporating realistic path - loss and blockage models , which are significantly different from @xmath0wave communications .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have pointed out that line - of - sight ( los ) and non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) links need to be appropriately modeled and may have different distributions , due to the more prominent impact of spatial blockages at mmwave frequencies compared to @xmath0wave frequencies .",
    "furthermore , in mmwave communications a new outage state may be present in addition to los and nlos states , which better reflects blockage effects at high frequencies and accounts for the fact the a link may be too weak to be established .",
    "recently reported results on stochastic geometry modeling of mmwave cellular communications @xcite , @xcite take these aspects into account only in part .",
    "the approach proposed in @xcite is mathematically tractable for dense network deployments and relies upon an equivalent los ball approximation .",
    "the approach proposed in @xcite uses a similar los ball approximation , but is applicable to medium / sparse network deployments .",
    "the outage state observed in @xcite is not explicitly taken into account either in @xcite or in @xcite . against this background , in the present paper a new methodology to the stochastic geometry modeling of mmwave cellular communications",
    "is proposed , which explicitly incorporates the empirical path - loss and blockage models recently reported in @xcite .",

    "system model and main modeling assumptions are introduced . in section [ coveragerate ] , the mathematical frameworks for computing coverage probability and average rate are described . in section",
    "[ results ] , the frameworks are validated via numerical simulations and the performance of mmwave and @xmath0wave cellular networks are compared .",

    "the mt is assumed to be served by the bs providing the smallest path - loss to it .",

    "the set of interfering bss is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the distance from the generic bs to the mt is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "thanks to the small wavelength , mmwave cellular networks are capable of exploiting directional beamforming for compensating for the increased path - loss at mmwave frequencies and for overcoming the additional noise due to the large transmission bandwidth . as a desirable bonus ,",
    "directional beamforming provides interference isolation , which reduces the impact of the other - cell interference .",
    "thus , antenna arrays are assumed at both the bss and the mt for performing directional beamforming . for mathematical tractability and",
    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , the actual antenna array patterns are approximated by considering a sectored antenna model .",
    "in particular , the antenna gain of the generic bs , @xmath6 , and of the mt , @xmath7 , can be formulated as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the angle off the boresight direction , @xmath11 denotes the beamwidth of the main lobe , @xmath12 is the array gain of the main lobe and @xmath13 is the antenna gain of the side lobe .",
    "both the mt and its serving bs , @xmath3 , are assumed to estimate the angles of arrival and to adjust their antenna steering orientations accordingly . on the intended links , therefore",
    ", the maximum directivity gain can be exploited .",
    "thus , the directivity gain of the intended link is @xmath14 .",
    "the beams of all non - intended links are assumed to be randomly oriented with respect to each other and to be uniformly distributed in @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , the directivity gains of the interfering links , @xmath16 for @xmath17 , are randomly distributed .",
    "based on , their probability density function ( pdf ) can be formulated as @xmath18 , where : @xmath19 for @xmath9 , @xmath20 is the kronecker s delta function and @xmath21 denotes the convolution operator .",
    "let an arbitrary link of length @xmath5 , _",

    "iii - d ) , a three - state statistical model for each link is assumed , according to which each link can be in a los , nlos or in an outage ( out ) state .",
    "a los state occurs if there is no blockage between bs and mt .",
    "a nlos state , on the other hand , occurs if the bs - to - mt link is blocked .",
    "an outage state occurs if the path - loss between bs and mt is so high that no link between them can be established . in this case",
    ", the path - loss of the link is assumed to be infinite . in practice , outages occur implicitly when the path - loss in either a los or a nlos state are sufficiently large . in (",
    "7 ) , with the aid of experimental results , it is proved that adding an outage state , which usually is not observed for transmission at @xmath0wave frequencies , provides a more accurate statistical description of the inherent coverage possibilities at mmwave frequencies .",
    "in particular , the probabilities of occurrence @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 of los , nlos and outage states , respectively , as a function of the distance @xmath5 can be formulated , based on experimental results , as follows ( * ? ? ? * eq .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 .",
    "this originates from the thinning property of the ppps @xcite . from , the densities of the ppps @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are equal to @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "based on the channel measurements reported in @xcite , the path - loss model for los and nlos links is assumed to be : @xmath36 where @xmath5 denotes the generic bs - to - mt distance , @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be interpreted as the path - loss of los and nlos links at a distance of 1 meter , respectively , @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the power path - loss exponents of los and nlos links , respectively .",
    "the path - loss model in is general enough for modeling several practical propagation conditions .",
    "for example , it can be linked to the widespread used @xmath41 model @xcite , @xcite , by setting @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table i ) .",

    "@xmath47      in addition to the distance - dependent path - loss model of section [ pathlossmodeling ] , each link is assumed to be subject to a complex randomly distributed channel gain , which , for a generic bs - to - mt link , is denoted by @xmath48 . according to @xcite , the power gain @xmath49",
    "is assumed to follow a log - normal distribution with mean ( in db ) equal to @xmath50 and standard deviation ( in db ) equal to @xmath51 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 takes into account large - scale shadowing .",

    "the shadowing correlations between links are ignored .",
    "thus , the fading power gains of los and nlos links are assumed to be independent and identically distributed .",
    "as recently remarked and verified with the aid of simulations in @xcite , this assumption usually causes a minor loss of accuracy in the evaluation of the statistics of the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) . due to space limitations and for ease of description , fast - fading",
    "is neglected in the present paper , but it may be readily incorporated .",

    "they can be formulated as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 denotes the distance of a generic bs to the mt , and @xmath61 denotes an empty set .",
    "hence , the path - loss of the serving bs , @xmath3 , can be formulated as @xmath62 .",
    "based on the system model of section [ systemmodel ] , the sinr of the cellular network under analysis can be formulated as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the transmit power , @xmath66 is the power gain of the serving bs , @xmath3 , @xmath67 is the noise power and @xmath68 is the aggregate other - cell interference , _",

    "<S> its peculiarity lies in considering realistic path - loss and blockage models , which are derived from experimental data recently reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the path - loss model accounts for different distributions for line - of - sight and non - line - of - sight propagation conditions and the blockage model includes an outage state that provides a better representation of the outage possibilities of millimeter wave communications . by modeling the locations of the base stations as points of a poisson point process and by relying upon a noise - limited approximation for typical millimeter wave network deployments , </S>",
    "<S> exact integral expressions for computing the coverage probability and the average rate are obtained . with the aid of monte carlo simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the noise - limited approximation is shown to be sufficiently accurate for typical network densities . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is shown that sufficiently dense millimeter wave cellular networks are capable of outperforming micro wave cellular networks , both in terms of coverage probability and average rate .    tba . </S>"
