    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are often believed to play a significant role in galaxy evolution .",
    "as the observed scaling relations between black hole mass and global properties of their host galaxies seem to require self - regulation between black hole growth and galaxy evolution , theoretical models often include agn feedback as a core component of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , understanding how black holes and galaxies coevolve over hubble time is observationally limited due to the scarcity of direct measurements of scaling relations at high redshift @xcite , and the nature of agn feedback and the coupling of the agn energy output with the interstellar matter ( ism ) is a subject of active research in this field .",
    "agn gas outflows are often observed over galaxy scales @xcite , hence , outflows may function as an effective channel of agn feedback . by connecting nuclear activity with the larger scale ism and star formation ( sf ) , agn outflows may push gas out of host galaxies and/or heat up the ism , leading to suppression of sf @xcite . on the other hand , outflows may trigger sf by compressing the ism @xcite .",
    "currently , the evidence of negative agn feedback on sf is yet to be conclusive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while detections of positive feedback on sf have been reported by several observational works based on individual objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is of importance to investigate the true nature of agn feedback and understand the overall effect of agns through gas outflows .",
    "the direct connection between agn activity and sf seems complex as various observations have been presented in the literature . for typical agns",
    ", a positive correlation has been reported between agn luminosity , probed by either optical or x - ray , and sf luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating an average scaling between agn activity and sfr .",
    "in contrast , at high redshift in particular , x - ray agns seem to show enhanced sfr @xcite .",
    "since the sfr of agn host galaxies is difficult to measure and there may be systematic differecne among various sfr indicators based on uv , optical , ir signatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more detailed investigation is required to reveal the nature of agn and sf connection . in comparing with non - agn galaxies ,",
    "a recent study by @xcite reported that x - ray and optical agns tend to have lower specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) compared to star - forming galaxies .",
    "a similar work by @xcite showed that radio and optical agns have on average lower ssfr than star - forming galaxies , while mid - infrared selected agns show comparable or slightly higher ssfr than star - forming galaxies .",
    "these results based on the present - day galaxies may suggest that agn feedback suppresses sf .",
    "however , the physical mechanism for connecting agn and sf is yet to be clear , requiring further detailed studies of the link between outflows and sf .    to understand the role of agn gas outflows in galaxy evolution , it is important to investigate how common and strong these outflows are so that agns as a population , instead of individual objects , can be used for connecting outflows with agn energetics and galaxy evolution .",
    "while the demography of ionized gas outflows in agns was limited to relatively small samples in the past , more robust results became available recently based on statistical samples of agns from large surveys .    to perform a statistical investigation of gas outflows and their connection to agn activity",
    ", we are performing a series of studies using a large sample of type 2 agns from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",

    "* here after , paper 1 ) presented a census of ionized gas outflows based on the [ ] @xmath05007 kinematics , by analyzing a sample of 39,000 present - day type 2 agns .",
    "at least 50% of agns over the full luminosity range explored in that study , shows kinematic signatures of gas outflows .",
    "this outflow fraction is considered as a lower limit for low - luminosity agns since their outflow indicator ( i.e. , a wing component of the [ ]  line ) is relatively weak and the gravitational potential of their host galaxy dominates in forming the emission line profile .",
    "in fact , for high - luminosity agns , the outflow fraction is over 90% , indicating that the majority of energetic agns show outflows .",
    "the steep increase of the outflow fraction with eddington ratio indicates a close link between outflow kinematics and agn accretion .",
    "in contrast , we find no strong correlation between radio luminosity and ionized gas kinematics , indicating that the outflows are not directly connected to radio activity for most agns . in the second of this series , presented 3-d biconical outflow models combined with a thin dust plane , in order to constrain the intrinsic physical nature of gas outflows .",
    "our models successfully reproduced the observed emission line profiles and the distribution of the velocity - velocity dispersion ( vvd ) diagram measured from the [ ]  line .",
    "based on the monte carlo simulations of the vvd distribution , we constrained the physical parameters of the outflows , including launching velocity , opening angle , and dust extinction .    in this paper",

    "composite objects in general follow the same trend although at the highest luminosity bin , the number of objects is relatively small .",
    "in contrast , sf galaxies do not show any significant change of the vvd diagram as a function of [ ]  luminosity , suggesting that photoionization mechanism of the [ ]  line is not directly responsible for the [ ]  kinematics .",

    "as expected , sfr is not affected by gas kinematics in sf galaxies since gas kinematics are mainly due to the galaxy gravitational potential rather than agn outflows .",

    "interestingly , agns with higher outflow velocities have on average higher ssfr than agns with lower outflow velocities , implying that outflows do not instantly suppress sf , although the time scale of sf quenching has to be carefully investigated .",
    "since agns with strong outflows show higher sfr than agns with weak outflows , this may indicate a close link between outflows and sf .",
    "we find no evidence of enhanced sf in agns .",
    "even for the agns with extreme outflow velocities , ssfr is not very high and rather it is comparable to that of sf galaxies ( dashed line ) , suggesting that host galaxies of extreme agn outflows have regular sfr compared to sf galaxies .",
    "in contrast , ssfr decreases with decreasing outflow velocities .",
    "for example , agns with no or weak outflows ( i.e. , when @xmath57 ) , ssfr is almost an order of magnitude lower than sf galaxies or agns with strong outflows .",

    "although it is previously found that optical and x - ray agns have on average lower ssfr than sf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we see a distribution from agns with strong outflow , high eddington accretion , and regular sfr to agns with no outflow , low eddington accretion , and much lower sfr .",
    "the trend between eddington ratio and ssfr naturally explains the observed agn - star formation luminosity relation in the local universe @xcite .",

    "agns with high - eddington accretion develop strong outflows while sf is on - going as in regular sf galaxies .",
    "when the outflows start impacting on the ism after the order of a dynamical time , the effect of agn feedback is observable as the sfr decreases while agn becomes weaker and no strong outflows are visible .",

    "the distribution of agns from strong outflow , high eddington , and regular sfr to no outflow , low eddington , and low sfr may be understood as the evolutionary sequence caused by delayed agn feedback .",
    "alternatively , the same evolutionary sequence can be interpreted as the consequence of depletion of gas supply .",
    "when gas is supplied , both agn and sf are triggered .",
    "however , once gas is depleted , both agn activity and sf decreases . thus , we naturally expect that agns with strong outflow , high eddington , and regular sfr become agns with no outflow , low eddington , and low sfr . in this case , no agn feedback is invoked and simply gas depletion causes the transition .    instead of evolutionary sequence , it is also possible that intrinsic gas content varies among galaxies at given stellar mass . if the amount of gas is intrinsically large , agns may tend to be high - eddington with strong outflows and host galaxies show regular sfr as in sf galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "if gas content is intrinsically lower , sfr is lower than that of galaxies in star - forming sequence , and agns have relatively low eddington and weak outflows .    for given our data set ,",
    "it is not clear which scenario best explains the observed trend .",
    "in particular , in the evolutionary sequence scenario , it is very difficult to confirm whether agn feedback causes the transition or the transition is natural outcome of gas depletion . in the case of the 3rd scenario",
    ", we may be able to investigate the difference of intrinsic gas content based on co observations by selecting agns with strong and no outflow for given stellar mass and morphology .",
    "the decreasing trend of ssfr with decreasing eddington ratio down to 10@xmath67 shown in figure 10 can be interpreted in two different ways : selection bias and intrinsic nature .",
    "we first examine whether the lower ssfr of low eddington agns is due to the selection bias .",
    "since we classify agns based on the emission line flux ratios in the bpt diagram , if agns produce weak emission lines , which can be over - shined by the emission produced by strong star formation , the combined observed emission lines are likely to be classified as sf galaxies rather than agns .",
    "thus , it is possible that we may miss very weak black hole activity present in strongly sf galaxies due to the limitation of the optical bpt classification .",
    "note that we do not consider very weak black hole activity with extremely low eddington ratios ( @xmath13410@xmath66 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since these very weak activities are not generally considered as agn population and the feedback energy from these objects is expected to be negligible in the context of galaxy evolution .",
    "if we focus on low eddington ratio agns between 10@xmath66 and 10@xmath135 , it is not clear why we should expect these agns are dominantly hosted by highly sf galaxies , while we expect that very weak black hole activity is present in most galaxies . by selecting sf galaxies , @xcite reported that the mean sf luminosity correlates with the mean agn x - ray luminosity down to eddington ratio @xmath136 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is extremely difficult to investigate the distribution of eddington ratios below @xmath136 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for investigating whether our optical agn sample misses low eddington agns hosted by strongly sf galaxies ,",
    "x - ray agn sample is very useful since optical bpt - based classification can be avoided .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported that their swift - bat agn sample shows on average lower ssfr compared to sf galaxies , indicating the same trend as we found in our sample .",
    "we independently investigate this issue by selecting x - ray agns from swift - bat 70 month catalogue @xcite after matching with our sdss sample .",
    "although the number of x - ray agns , for which we can determine stellar mass and eddington ratio , is relatively small , these 59 x - ray agns show a consistent trend that agns with low eddington ratio tend to show lower ssfr than agns with high eddington ratio .",
    "for example , since the eddington ratio ( log l@xmath61/l@xmath60 ) of this matched sample ranges from -3 to 0 , we divide them into 3 groups . we find that the d@xmath52-based ssfr of high eddington agns ( log l@xmath137/l@xmath138 @xmath11 -1 ) is higher by 0.13 and 0.83 dex , respectively , than that of intermediate ( -2@xmath2 log l@xmath137/l@xmath138 @xmath2 - 1 ) and low eddington agns ( log l@xmath137/l@xmath138 @xmath2 -2 ) , although the distribution of ssfr in each group is very large with rms of 0.7 to 0.8 dex due to presumably small number statistics . note that we were not able to use ir - based sfr since ir luminosity taken from @xcite is available only for 20 out of 59 objects .",
    "although we see a consistent trend between eddington ratios and ssfr based on the x - ray sample , we can not firmly conclude whether the lack of low - eddington agns in sf galaxies in our optical sample is due to selection effect or intrinsic nature since the size of the matched sample is very small and the x - ray flux limit of the swift - bat sample is still shallow ( down to l@xmath137/l@xmath138 @xmath2@xmath1 - 3 ) .    in investigating the trend between ssfr and eddington ratio ,",
    "it is important to reliably estimate agn bolometric luminosity . in the case of optically - identified type 2 agns , the [ ]  luminosity",
    "is typically used for calculating eddington ratios as in our study ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the bolometric correction of [ ]  is difficult to determine due to various effects , including dust extinction and the dependency on the ionization parameter @xcite .",
    "also , star forming region can contribute to the [ ]  flux observed through an aperture larger than the size of the narrow - line region .",
    "therefore , it is important to decompose the agn and sf fraction in the observed [ ]  luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by simply assuming the maximum agn fraction in the [ ] luminosity of sf galaxies as 1% , 10% , and 50% , we simulate the distribution of ssfr as in figure 10 in order to test the effect of the contribution of non - detected agns in sf galaxies",
    "we find that the case of 1% and 10% agn luminosity does not change the decreasing trend of the ssfr as a function of eddington ratios down to 10@xmath139 .",
    "when we assume 50% of [ ]  in sf galaxies is originated from agns , we still see the same trend while the difference of ssfr between high and low eddington agns becomes smaller .    due to the aforementioned issues and uncertainty of eddington ratio ,",
    "it is clear that more detailed investigations are required to confirm the trend of the decreasing ssfr with decreasing eddington ratios .",
    "in particular , a detailed comparison between x - ray and optical agns , for example , using the optical follow - up survey of the swift - bat agns @xcite , will be very useful to constrain the nature of host galaxies of low eddington agns , which is beyond the scope of this paper .      since we have adopted the estimated sfr based on ir from @xcite , it is important to discuss whether the main results of this paper is affected by the uncertainty of ir - based sfr . as shown in figure 11 , other sfr indicators , i.e. , d@xmath52 and uv - to - optical color show consistent results . while sf galaxies have overall lower values of d@xmath1404000",
    ", there is a clear spread of d@xmath52 among agns , which broadly correlates with outflow velocities .",
    "also , the uv - to - optical color shows a similar trend with agn outflow velocities .",

    "using a large sample of @xmath1110,000 type 2 agns out to z@xmath10.3 , we investigated the kinematics of the ionized gas outflows , demography of outflows in agns and sf galaxies , and the connection between outflows and sf .",

    "<S> we present gas kinematics based on the [ ] @xmath05007 line and their connection to galaxy gravitational potential , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) energetics , and star formation , using a large sample of @xmath1110,000 agns and star - forming ( sf ) galaxies at z@xmath20.3 . </S>",
    "<S> gas and stellar velocity dispersions are comparable to each other in sf galaxies , indicating that the ionized gas kinematics can be accounted by the gravitational potential of host galaxies . in contrast , agns clearly show non - gravitational kinematics , which is comparable to or stronger than the virial motion caused by the gravitational potential . the [ ]  velocity - velocity dispersion ( vvd ) diagram dramatically expands toward high values as a function of agn luminosity , implying that the outflows are agn - driven , while sf galaxies do not show such a trend . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fraction of agns with a signature of outflow kinematics , steeply increases with agn luminosity and eddington ratio . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the majority of luminous agns presents strong non - gravitational kinematics in the [ ]  profile . </S>",
    "<S> agns with strong outflow signatures show on average similar specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) to that of starforming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , agns with weak or no outflows have an order of magnitude lower ssfr , suggesting that agns with current strong outflows do now show any negative agn feedback and that it may take the order of a dynamical time to impact on star formation over galactic scales . </S>"
