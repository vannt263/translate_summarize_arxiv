    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars show large amplitude pulsations with periods of about 100 to 1000 days .",
    "the pulsation creates strong shock waves in the stellar atmosphere , causing a levitation of the outer layers .",
    "this cool and relatively dense environment provides favourable conditions for the formation of molecules and dust grains .",
    "dust grains play an important role for the heavy mass loss , which influences the further evolution of the star .",
    "condensation and evaporation of dust in envelopes of pulsating stars must be treated as a time - dependent process since the time scales for condensation and evaporation are comparable to variations of the thermodynamic conditions in the stellar envelope .",
    "the radiation pressure on newly formed dust grains can enhance or even create shock waves leading to more or less pronounced discrete dust shells in the expanding circumstellar flow ( e.g.  fleischer et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; hfner et al .",
    "@xcite ; hfner & dorfi @xcite ) .",
    "since a significant part of the dust grains transferred to interstellar space are produced in the atmosphere of these old luminous stars ( sedlmayr @xcite ) an understanding of the nature of mass loss of these long - period variables is crucial for the general understanding of dust in space .",
    "modelling circumstellar envelopes requires knowledge of the absorption properties of the different types of grains over the relevant part of the electromagnetic spectrum . for this",
    "the optical properties of the corresponding dust material are needed .",
    "amorphous carbon is a very good candidate as the most common type of carbon grains present in circumstellar envelopes , since the far - infrared data of late - type stars show a spectral index as expected for a very disordered two - dimensional material like amorphous carbon ( huffman @xcite ) .",
    "silicon carbide ( sic ) grains seem to be another important component of the dust in circumstellar envelopes .",
    "while amorphous carbon could explain the continuum emission , sic particles could be responsible for the 11.3 @xmath0 m band observed in many c - rich objects .    in this paper",
    ", we present self - consistent dynamical models of circumstellar dust shells calculated with selected laboratory amorphous carbon data .",
    "based on these models we have performed radiative transfer calculations for pure amorphous carbon and in some cases also including sic dust . in sect.[opaci ] the used amorphous carbon data are described .",
    "the influence on the model structure is described in sect.[s : dynmod ] and the resulting spectral appearance is discussed in sect.[sed ] .",
    "the two sets of quantities that are used to describe optical properties of solids are the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index @xmath1 and the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function ( or relative permittivity ) @xmath2 = @xmath3 + @xmath4 .",
    "these two sets of quantities are not independent , the complex dielectric function @xmath2 is related to the complex refractive index , @xmath5 , by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , when the material is assumed to be non - magnetic ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "reflection and transmission by bulk media are best described using the complex refractive index , @xmath5 , whereas absorption and scattering by particles which are small compared with the wavelength are best described by the complex dielectric function , @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of evaluating the expected spectral dependence of extinction for a given grain model ( i.e.  assumed composition and size distribution ) is essentially that of evaluating the extinction efficiency q@xmath9 .",
    "it is the sum of corresponding quantities for absorption and scattering ; @xmath10 .",
    "these efficiencies are functions of two quantities ; a dimension - less size parameter @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 the grain radius and @xmath13 the wavelength ) and a composition parameter , the complex refractive index @xmath5 of the grain material . q@xmath14 and q@xmath15 can therefore be calculated from the complex refractive index using mie theory for any assumed grain model .",
    "the resulting values of total extinction can be compared with observational data .",
    "a limit case within the mie theory is the rayleigh approximation for spherical particles .",
    "this approximation is valid when the grains are small compared to the wavelength , @xmath16 and in the limit of zero phase shift in the particle ( @xmath17 ) . in the rayleigh approximation the extinction by a sphere in vacuum is given as : @xmath18      a proper application of mie theory to experimental data requires that the samples are prepared such that the particles are quite small ( usually sub - micrometer ) , well isolated from one another , and that the total mass of particles is accurately known .    in order to obtain single isolated homogeneous particles , the grains are often dispersed in a solid matrix .",
    "small quantities of sample are mixed throughly with the powdered matrix material e.g.  kbr or csi .",
    "the matrix is pressed into a pellet which has a bulk transparency in the desired wavelength region .",
    "some of the problems with this technique are that there is a tendency for the sample to clump along the outside rim of the large matrix grains and that the introduction of a matrix , which has a refractive index different from vacuum , might influence the band shape and profile .",
    "this matrix effect can be a problem for comparisons of laboratory measurements with astronomical spectra ( papoular et al .",
    "@xcite ; mutschke et al.@xcite ) .    by measuring the sample on a substrate ( e.g.  quartz , kbr , si or nacl ) using e.g.  an infrared microscope , the matrix effect can nearly be avoided since the sample is almost fully surrounded by a gas ( e.g.  air , ar or he ) .",
    "but the amount of material in the microscopic aperture remains unknown , which is an important disadvantage of this method .",
    "therefore , these measurements are not quantitative but they reveal the shape of the spectrum nearly without a matrix effect ( mutschke et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a major problem of both methods is clustering of the grain samples either during the production of the particles or within the matrix or on the substrate .",
    "clustering can cause a dramatic difference in the optical properties ( huffman @xcite ) . a way to avoid this problem is to perform the optical measurements on a polished bulk sample . for the determination of both @xmath19 and @xmath20 two or more measurements on bulk samples are required .",
    "this might be done either by a transmission and a reflection measurement , or by two reflectance measurements determinations at different angles or with different polarisations .",
    "since the real part , @xmath19 , of the refractive index , @xmath5 , is determined by the phase velocity and the imaginary part , @xmath20 , by the absorption , a transmission measurement easily fixes @xmath20 .",
    "the kramers - kronig relations can be applied in order to obtain the optical constants for grain measurements .",
    "the real part of the refractive index can be expressed as an integral of the imaginary part ( see e.g.  bohren & huffman @xcite ) .",
    "while carbon is expected to constitute a major fraction of the circumstellar dust in carbon stars , its exact form is still unclear .",
    "carbon has the unique property that the atoms can form three different types of bonds through sp@xmath21 , sp@xmath22 ( graphite ) and sp@xmath23 ( diamond ) hybridization .",
    "a number of observations of late - type stars contradict the presence of graphite as the dominant dust type ( e.g. campbell et al .",
    "@xcite ; sopka et al .",
    "@xcite ; martin & rogers @xcite ; grtler et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the far - infrared ( fir )",
    "data of late - type stars generally show a dust emissivity law of @xmath24 with a spectral index of @xmath25 .",
    "while graphite grains have a fir emission proportional to @xmath26 ( draine & lee @xcite ) , a @xmath27 behaviour can be expected in a very disordered two - dimensional material like amorphous material ( huffman @xcite ; jger et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "amorphous carbon grains therefore seem to be a very good candidate as the common type of carbon grains present in circumstellar envelopes",
    ". another possibility could be small diamond grains .",
    "presolar diamond grains have been identified from primitive ( unaltered ) meteorites ( carbonaceous chondrites ) and are the most abundant ( 500 ppm ) of the presolar grains discovered so far ( lewis et al .",
    "at least 3% of the total amount of carbon present at the formation of the solar system was in the form of diamonds ( huss & lewis @xcite ) .",
    "the place of origin of the presolar diamonds is still unknown , but since they can only have formed under reducing conditions jrgensen ( @xcite ) has suggested c - rich agb stars as the place of formation of the majority of the presolar diamond grains .",
    "it has been suggested by krger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that the surface growth processes on carbonaceous seed particles in circumstellar envelopes will take place at sp@xmath23 bonded carbon atoms rather than at sp@xmath22 bonded ones , which suggests that the grain material formed in circumstellar envelopes could be amorphous - diamond like carbon .",
    "presolar diamonds extracted from meteorites have a median grain size of about 2 nm ( fraundorf et al .",
    "@xcite ) , meaning that each diamond contains a few hundred to a few thousand carbon atoms .",
    "the presolar diamonds therefore seem to actually consist of a mixture of diamond ( core ) and hydrogenate amorphous carbon ( surface ) having about 0.46 the volume fraction of pure diamond ( bernatowicz et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "several spectra of presolar diamonds from various meteorites have been published ( lewis et al .",
    "@xcite ; colangeli et al .",
    "@xcite ; mutschke et al .",

    "submitted to meteorit .",
    "sci . ) and even though a number of artifacts tends to be present in all the spectra , the general trend is that the presolar diamonds have an absorption coefficient that is twice that of pure diamond and a factor of a hundred less than the `` diamond - like '' amorphous carbon of jger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "there exists a wide variety of possible amorphous carbon grain types , which fall in between the categories `` diamond - like '' and `` graphite - like '' amorphous carbon .",
    "we have calculated dynamical models using various laboratory data of amorphous carbon to determine the possible influence of these different grain types on the structure and the wind properties of c - rich agb star models .",
    "laboratory conditions are far from the actual space conditions where grains are produced or processed , but experiments in which physical and chemical parameters are controlled and monitored do give the option of selecting materials which may match the astronomical observations . when choosing which amorphous carbon data to use one",
    "is faced with the fact that due to the various processes used in the sample preparation , differences often appear between the measurements of various authors .",
    "another major problem is that the optical properties of amorphous carbon are most often obtained by different techniques in different wavelength regions .",
    "extinction measurements of sub - micron - sized particles is the most common technique in the infrared . in the visible and ultraviolet , reflectivity and transmission measurements",
    "are often obtained on bulk samples .",
    "= 1.0    bussoletti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have determined the extinction efficiencies for various types of sub - micron amorphous carbon particles and spectroscopically analysed them in the wavelength range 1000  ",
    "300 @xmath0 m . in their paper",
    "they present an updated version of the data already published from 2000  to 40 @xmath0 m ( borghesi et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) and new data obtained in the uv / vis ( 1000  3000  ) and in the fir ( 35  300 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the sub - micron amorphous carbon grains were obtained by means of two methods : ( 1 ) striking an arc between two amorphous carbon electrodes in a controlled ar atmosphere at different pressures ( samples ac1 , ac2 and ac3 ; where the numbers refer to different accumulation distances from the arc discharge ) ; ( 2 ) burning hydrocarbons ( benzene and xylene ) in air at room pressure ( samples be and xy ) .",
    "the smoke was collected on quartz substrates . for the uv / vis",
    "spectroscopy the quartz substrates on which the particles had been collected were used directly while the dust was scrapped from the substrate and embedded in kbr pellets for the ir spectroscopy .",
    "bussoletti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that the extinction efficiencies , @xmath28 , for the ac samples should be corrected by a factor of 5 due to an experimental underestimation of the pellet density .",
    "this correction gives an agreement with the data by koike et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "colangeli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) measured the extinction efficiency in the range 40 nm  2 mm .",
    "they produced three different samples ; two by arc discharge between amorphous carbon electrodes in ar and h@xmath29 atmospheres at 10 mbar ( sample acar and ach2 respectively ) and one by burning benzene in air ( sample be ) .",
    "the samples were deposited onto different substrates for the uv / vis measurements , while in the ir the samples where prepared both on a substrate and by being embedded in kbr / csi pellets and for the fir measurements the samples were embedded in polyethylene pellets .",
    "these different but overlapping methods gave the possibility of evaluating the difference as a result of embedding the samples in a matrix or by having them on a substrate .",
    "colangeli et al .  ( @xcite ) found that embedding the samples in a matrix introduces a systematic error ( the matrix effect ) while the spectra obtained for grains deposited onto a substrate did not suffer from any matrix effect detectable within the accuracy available in the experiment .",
    "therefore the fir data were corrected for the extinction offset introduced by the matrix .",
    "jger et al .  ( @xcite ) produced structurally different carbon materials by pyrolizing cellulose materials at different temperatures ( 400@xmath30c , 600@xmath30c , 800@xmath30c and 1000@xmath30c ) , and characterised them in great detail .",
    "these materials have increasing sp@xmath22/sp@xmath23 ratios making the amorphous carbon pyrolysed at 400@xmath30c the most `` diamond - like '' with the lowest sp@xmath22/sp@xmath23 ratio while the amorphous carbon pyrolysed at 1000@xmath30c is more `` graphite - like '' with the highest sp@xmath22/sp@xmath23 ratio .",
    "the pyrolysed carbon samples were embedded in epoxy resin and reflectance of the samples was measured in the range 200 nm to 500 @xmath0 m , making this the first consistent laboratory measurement of amorphous carbon over the whole spectral range relevant for radiative transfer calculations of c - rich agb stars . from the reflectance spectra the complex refractive index , @xmath5 , was derived by the lorentz oscillator method ( see e.g.  bohren & huffman 1983 , chap .",
    "there is a significant difference between the two low temperature ( 400@xmath30c and 600@xmath30c ) and the two high temperature samples ( 800@xmath30c and 1000@xmath30c ) .",
    "the latter two behave very similar to glassy carbon .",
    "in contrast to grain measurements , the bulk samples by jger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) give the possibility of investigating the difference between the influence of the internal structure of amorphous material and the morphology of the carbon grains .",
    "these two properties can be separated out due to the careful investigation of the internal structures of the four samples and the range of material properties that these four amorphous carbon samples span ( from `` diamond - like '' to `` graphite - like '' ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     = 0.90    from fig.[colours ] we can infer that the influence of the different amorphous carbon dust data used in the radiative transfer calculation is much stronger than the effect of the model structures .",
    "the colours resulting from the same dust data fall approximately into the same region of a two - colour - diagram , whether they are calculated on top of the corresponding model structure ( upper panel ) or a fixed model sequence ( lower panel ) .",
    "this applies for all data sets .",
    "in addition we computed synthetic colours for the and the data , but they are not shown in fig . [ colours ] to avoid overlaps in the plot .",
    "the colours fall into the same region as the colours as one would expect because the @xmath28 are very similar .",
    "the same applies for the and the data .",
    "only the j flux differs between and , the reason being that the data do not extend below 1  @xmath0 m and therefore the corresponding contribution to the j filter is lacking .",
    "carbon bearing grains are expected to form in the outflows of c - rich agb stars .",
    "the two most common types of carbon grains in these stars are expected to be amorphous carbon and sic grains .",
    "we have investigated the direct influence of different dust optical properties on the wind characteristics and the resulting observable properties of the dynamical models .",
    "the term amorphous carbon covers a wide variety of material properties from `` diamond - like '' to `` graphite - like '' .",
    "we have used @xmath19 and @xmath20 data of maron ( @xcite ) , rouleau & martin ( @xcite ) , preibisch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , zubko et al .  ( @xcite ) and jger et al .  ( @xcite ) to investigate the influence of different types of amorphous carbon , on the structure and the wind properties of dynamical models .",
    "the rosseland and planck mean values of q@xmath31/a used in the model computations were calculated from the rayleigh approximation for spheres .",
    "the difference between the planck and the rosseland means is relatively small for the amorphous carbon data because the grains have a continuous opacity with a smooth wavelength dependence .    in our test models , both the outflow velocity @xmath32 and degree of condensation @xmath33 change significantly with the dust data used .",
    "@xmath33 increases with decreasing dust extinction efficiency while @xmath32 decreases , reflecting a lower optical depth of the circumstellar dust shell .",
    "the mass loss rate is , however , not significantly influenced by the use of different dust data .",
    "on top of the structures resulting from the dynamic calculations we have performed detailed radiative transfer calculations to obtain the spectral energy distribution of the circumstellar dust shells . regarding infrared colours , the influence of the different dust data used in the radiative transfer calculation is much stronger than the effect of the underlying hydrodynamic model structure .",
    "however , this should not be used as an excuse for fitting observations by arbitrarily choosing the optical properties of the dust grains for a given model structure . in a consistent model the dynamical properties ( e.g.  outflow velocities ) and the optical appearance of the circumstellar envelope",
    "are related in a complex way .",
    "the influence of including sic grains is that the 11.3  @xmath0 m feature appears in the spectral energy distribution of the models .",
    "how much sic should be `` mixed '' into a model to reproduce the 11.3 @xmath0 m feature observed ( e.g.  class 4 in goebel @xcite ) will very much depend on the assumptions which are made about the size and shape of the sic grains which enter into the model ( papoular et al .",
