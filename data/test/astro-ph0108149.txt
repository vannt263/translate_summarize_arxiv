    "sn 1995n in mcg02 - 38 - 017 ( also known as arp 261 ) was discovered by pollas ( 1995 ) on 5 may 1995 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) . its approximate distance is 24 mpc , based on @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 and the measured recession velocity of the host galaxy ( 1834 @xmath0 ; theureau et al .",
    "optical spectra of the object obtained by benetti , bouchet , & schwarz ( 1995 ) and by garnavich & challis ( 1995 ) showed it to be a peculiar type ii supernova , with h@xmath2 emission ( full - width at half - maximum intensity [ fwhm ] @xmath6 ) and narrow lines of he  i , he  ii , [ n  ii ] , [ o  i ] , [ o  iii ] , [ ne  iii ] , [ ca  v ] , fe  ii , [ fe  ii ] , [ fe  iii ] , [ fe  vii ] , and [ fe  x ] . the intensity ratios of the narrow oxygen lines suggest a high electron density , @xmath7 @xmath8 ( garnavich & challis 1995 ) .",

    "the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity was @xmath9 in the 0.110 kev band .",
    "the narrow emission lines observed from sn 1995n place it in the type iin category ( schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1991a , b , 1997 ) , which often show a slow optical decline compared to other type ii supernovae ( sne  ii ) .",
    "baird et al . (",
    "1998 ) have noted the slow evolution of sn 1995n .",
    "the high x - ray and radio luminosities of sn 1995n place it in a subset of sne  iin whose other well - studied members are sn 1986j ( rupen et al .",

    "all of them have x - ray luminosities @xmath10 , which are at least an order of magnitude higher than the x - ray luminosities of other sne  ii .",
    "these are also among the most luminous radio sne , although sn 1979c does rival them in luminosity , as does sn 1998bw , a very different kind of object and at a much earlier epoch ( e.g. , galama et al . 1998 ; kulkarni et al . 1998 ) .    the early optical observations of sn 1988z ( stathakis & sadler 1991 ) showed velocities up to @xmath11 , and very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) radio observations of sn 1986j ( bartel , shapiro , & rupen 1989 ; bartel et al .",

    "this combination suggests that the rapidly moving supernova material is running into dense circumstellar clumps and is driving slower shock fronts into them ( chugai 1993 ; chugai & danziger 1994 ; chugai et al .",
    "in addition , the combination of high velocities with strong circumstellar interaction requires that the supernova have considerable high - velocity gas in order not to be rapidly decelerated . for sn 1988z",
    ", chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) estimate that the total mass in supernova ejecta is only @xmath14 if the explosion energy is the standard @xmath15 ergs .    in order to more fully understand the nature of this peculiar subset of sne  iin , we have undertaken a detailed spectroscopic study of sn 1995n , one of the most important and thoroughly studied examples .",

    "wfpc2 @xmath17-band ( f814w ) image of sn 1995n obtained on 22 july 2000 ; the supernova is easily visible at @xmath18 mag .",
    "these two images demonstrate that the supernova occurred in a region relatively free of background emission and dust .",
    "the main observations of sn 1995n presented in this paper consist of ground - based optical spectra obtained on nine epochs and ultraviolet ( uv ) _ hst _ spectra on one epoch .",
    "the log of the observations is given in table [ tab1 ] , where the wavelength ranges , ut dates , and approximate epoch since explosion are summarized .",
    "the assumed explosion date of 4 july 1994 is uncertain , but this does not appreciably affect our results because our data were taken long after the explosion ; the spectra cover epochs of 3211799 days .",
    "standard procedures were followed for the spectral extractions and reductions , which included sky subtraction , wavelength and flux calibration , and removal of telluric absorption ( e.g. , matheson et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the ground - based observations fall in two main groups : within @xmath19 years after discovery , and @xmath20 years after discovery .",
    "the former were obtained primarily with the kast spectrograph ( miller & stone 1993 ; @xmath21 slit ) on the 3-m shane reflector at lick observatory , but the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ; @xmath22 slit ) on the keck - i telescope was used to acquire an excellent spectrum ( day 1007 ) nearly contemporaneously with one of the lick spectra ( day 1012 ) .",
    "all of the lick and keck spectra ( except day 1012 ) are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "one can see that the spectrum evolved slowly during the time interval shown .",
    "in this paper , we present a detailed analysis of only two of these spectra ( days 716 and 1007 , which are among the two best ones ) .    the very late - time ( @xmath20 years )",
    "ground - based spectra were taken through a @xmath23 slit with fors1 on the vlt at eso .",
    "the day 1769 spectrum was obtained with gratings 300v and 300i , giving a resolution of @xmath24   . for the day",
    "1799 spectrum the 600b , 600r , and 600i grisms were used , giving a higher resolution of @xmath25   .",
    "the day 1769 observing was done in good conditions , while the data from day 1799 were taken through clouds .",
    "the latter spectrum has higher signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath26 ) than the former , however , so emission - line measurements are reported for it ( scaled to the flux level of the day 1769 spectrum ) .",
    "the _ hst _ spectra on day 943 were obtained with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) with the g400h , g270h , and g160l gratings .",
    "total exposures times were 2860 , 4770 , and 2110  s , and the resolution was 3.0 , 2.1 , and 6.9    per diode , respectively .",
    "the spectra were calibrated by the fos pipeline at the space telescope science institute .",
    "all spectra , except the vlt and _ hst _ spectra , were calibrated to the @xmath27-band and @xmath16-band photometry of baird et al .",
    "the keck spectrum ( day 1007 ) has the highest @xmath26 , and in figure [ fig3 ] we show it together with the _ hst _ spectra ( day 943 ) .",
    "the keck and _ hst _ spectra were taken at different epochs , but from the day 1037 lick spectrum we find a smooth evolution , and we normalize the flux level of the overlapping region between the _ hst _ g400h spectrum and the keck spectrum to that of the keck epoch .    the dirbe / iras maps ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) give @xmath28 mag for the galactic reddening of sn 1995n . in addition , there could be internal reddening from both the host galaxy and the circumstellar environment .",
    "the host galaxy is a blue compact galaxy , a class which is generally dust - poor , although h  ii regions can show substantial reddening ( kong & cheng 1999 ) .",
    "the fact that the supernova is located in the outskirts of the galaxy ( figures [ fig1a ] , [ fig1b ] ) also makes it natural to expect a relatively low extinction . from the relative strengths of the higher members of the h  i and he  i recombination series , there is no indication of strong reddening (   [ sec_result ] ) . the normal intensity ratio of uv o  iii ] lines relative to the optical also indicates this . in the following , we use @xmath29 mag for the total reddening .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that there are lines spanning a large range of velocities , and we can distinguish at least three kinematic components in the supernova .",
    "the narrow , unresolved lines are clearly distinct , while the other two components are less obvious and are shown in the mg  ii @xmath30 , [ o iii ] @xmath31 , and h@xmath2 lines at 9431007 days on the same velocity scale in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the h@xmath2 and [ o  iii ] profiles are from the keck day 1007 spectrum and the mg  ii profile from the _ hst _ spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath2 and [ o  iii ] lines have quite different profiles , with the former having a fairly peaked profile , but with weak wings reaching very high velocity , @xmath32 , while the latter has a more boxy profile reaching a velocity of @xmath33 .",
    "another strong indication of two separate high - velocity components is the different temporal evolution of the [ o  i ] , [ o  ii ] , and [ o  iii ] lines compared to the others (   [ sec_time ] ) .",
    "here we discuss these three components individually .",
    "the narrowest lines in the spectra are unresolved , implying fwhm @xmath34 .",
    "they are listed in table [ tab2 ] , where it can be seen that the emission is dominated by ions with moderately high ionization .",
    "some of the lines provide useful diagnostics for the emitting region , and we begin by considering them .    *",
    "[ o  iii]*. the [ o  iii ] @xmath354959 , 5007 lines are by far the strongest narrow lines and , together with [ o  iii ] @xmath364363 , provide a useful constraint on the electron temperature @xmath37 and the electron density @xmath38 .",
    "the relatively low ratio of @xmath39 implies that collisional deexcitation of the @xmath40 level is important , so that the ratio depends on density as well as temperature ( e.g. , filippenko & halpern 1984 ; osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the densities corresponding to various assumed temperatures are in the range @xmath41 for @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) , where @xmath45 . on day 1799",
    "the vlt spectrum shows a similar value , @xmath46 , which gives @xmath47 for @xmath48 .    *",
    "o  iii bowen lines*. in the near - uv spectral region , several bowen fluorescence lines are seen , most notably o  iii @xmath49 .",
    "we measure @xmath50 and @xmath51 . based on the bowen process ,",
    "kallman & mccray ( 1980 ) give ratios of 0.18 and 0.28 for these lines , respectively .",
    "considering that the uncertainties in the fluxes of both lines are at least a factor of two , the agreement is satisfying .",
    "the @xmath52 line is severely blended with [ ne  iii ] @xmath53 and [ ne  v ] @xmath54 , and no reliable flux estimate can be obtained .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 can be used to estimate the bowen yield for he  ii @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( 25 ) in kallman & mccray ( 1980 ) , together with @xmath57 , gives a bowen yield of @xmath58 . correcting for reddening , we find @xmath59 , and therefore @xmath60 for sn 1995n at day 1007 . as a comparison ,",
    "schachter , filippenko , & kahn ( 1990 ) find a mean @xmath61 for a sample of seyfert nuclei , while kallmann & mccray find that planetary nebulae have @xmath62 .",
    "the dispersion in both values is considerable .    *",
    "[ o  ii]*. the spectra show that [ o  ii ] @xmath633726 , 3729 are not detected , but that [ o  ii ] @xmath637320 , 7330 are weakly present with narrow components .",
    "the fact that @xmath64 implies that @xmath65 , provided that @xmath66 k.    * [ n  ii]*. the auroral [ n  ii ] @xmath365755 line is present , but the nebular lines are superposed on the very strong h@xmath2 emission and it is not possible to obtain strong limits on them .",
    "we estimate @xmath67 , which implies that @xmath68 for @xmath69 k ( osterbrock 1989 ) .    *",
    "[ fe  vii]*. the observed lines of [ fe  vii ] are @xmath633586 , 3759 , 5159 , 5276 , 5721 , 6087 .",
    "as discussed by nussbaumer & storey ( 1982 ) and keenan & norrington ( 1987 , 1991 ) , several of the [ fe  vii ] lines provide diagnostic information on the emitting region .",
    "there is temperature sensitivity of the lines , and collisional deexcitation causes transitions from the low - density limits to the high - density limits in the range @xmath70 .    the observed , reddening - corrected ratio @xmath71 in the keck spectrum ( day 1007 ) , and @xmath72 in the 12 june 1999 vlt spectrum ( day 1799 ) . from figure 2 of keenan & norrington ( 1987 )",
    ", this sets a limit @xmath73 k for any density on day 1007 , and @xmath74 k for day 1799 .    in the day",
    "1799 spectrum , with the highest resolution , there are three distinct peaks at the positions of [ fe  vi ] @xmath75 , [ fe  vii ] @xmath76 , and [ fe  vi ] @xmath77 . because of blending of these lines , it is difficult to obtain accurate fluxes , and depending on where we estimate the base of the line we get a ratio in the range @xmath78 and @xmath79 on days 1007 and 1799 , respectively . from figure 1 of keenan & norrington ( 1987 ) , the lower limits imply that @xmath80 if @xmath81 k. the lines at @xmath364942 and @xmath364989 are contaminated by the strong complex of [ o  iii ] @xmath634959 , 5007 , with the result that interesting constraints on @xmath37 and @xmath38 can not be obtained from these lines ( keenan & norrington 1991 ) .",
    "overall , the above results point to a relatively high density for the narrow - line gas , which suggests a circumstellar rather than interstellar origin .",
    "if the [ o  iii ] and [ fe  vii ] lines are assumed to come from gas with similar physical properties , the implied characteristics are @xmath82 and @xmath69 k , although there is some evidence that the [ fe  vii ] emission comes from a somewhat hotter region .",
    "it is likely , because of the low velocity and the relatively low pressure , that this gas is the unshocked circumstellar wind .",
    "presumably it was photoionized by the uv and x - ray radiation emitted by the supernova right after shock breakout .",
    "one can derive a lower limit to the radial distance of this gas by taking the product of the highest observed supernova ejecta velocity and the estimated age . as discussed below",
    ", the highest velocity is @xmath83 .",
    "the wind electron density in front of the shock then becomes @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mass - loss rate from the progenitor star , @xmath86 is the wind velocity , and it has been assumed that h and he are fully ionized .",
    "the reference value of @xmath85 chosen here is close to the highest values that have been observed for galactic stars and to the strong radio emitter sn 1979c ( e.g. , lundqvist & fransson 1988 ) .",
    "either the progenitor star of sn 1995n was losing mass at an extraordinary rate , or the density of the observed gas is higher than the average density in the circumstellar wind .",
    "the gas density is sufficiently high that the recombination and excitation time scales are less than the supernova age , and approximate equilibrium is expected .",
    "the ionizing source is the x - ray emission , which had an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath87 in the 0.110 kev band during july 1996  january 1998 ( fox et al .",
    "observations give a temperature estimate of 9  kev if the emission is thermal ( fox et al .",
    "models of x - ray nebulae have been presented by tarter , tucker , & salpeter ( 1969 ) and kallman & mccray ( 1982 ) .",
    "the latter models assume a constant density surrounding a central source and generally take @xmath88 kev for the photoionizing source , but the calculations can be used to approximate the current situation , especially because the [ fe  vii ] lines are likely to be formed in a region optically thin to the ionizing continuum .",
    "the ionization properties depend on the ionization parameter , which can be defined as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the luminosity of the ionizing source .",
    "taking @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 cm , we find @xmath94 , which is very close to the ionization parameter where fe  vii is expected , for a @xmath88 kev source ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) . a lower temperature for the continuum source would increase the estimated @xmath95 for a fixed @xmath90 .",
    "the gas temperature of this region in the photoionization models is @xmath96 k , consistent with the observations .",
    "this comparison provides support for the overall model and , in particular , for the estimated radial distance of the emitting region .",
    "the intensity of the narrow lines gives another constraint on the physical conditions .",
    "the hydrogen lines are the best to use because there are no abundance uncertainties .",
    "while no narrow h  i lines can be seen in the day 1007 keck spectrum because of the strong broad component , the higher resolution day 1799 vlt spectrum clearly shows h@xmath2 , h@xmath97 , and h@xmath98 . for h@xmath97 , we find a luminosity of @xmath99 at 1799 days .",
    "if the emitting region is assumed to be at radius @xmath100 with a thickness @xmath101 and a covering factor @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 where the emissivity of h@xmath97 has been taken for @xmath104 k ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "although the density is uncertain , it is clear that the observations imply a small filling factor .",
    "another indication of the small filling factor of the @xmath105 gas is the detection of a substantial x - ray flux by _",
    "rosat_. if the gas were pervasive at @xmath106 cm , the resulting hydrogen column density , @xmath107 , would give rise to the complete absorption of the soft x - ray flux .",
    "the gas is not fully ionized and thus can effectively absorb the x - ray emission . in their estimate of the x - ray luminosity ,",
    "fox et al .",
    "( 2000 ) take @xmath108 based on the expected galactic absorption .",
    "most of the other ions that are observed in sn 1995n require an ionization parameter that is similar to that of fe  vii .",
    "the ions fe  vi through fe  xi , which are observed , occur over a relatively small range of ionization parameter ( e.g. , kallman & mccray 1982 ) .",
    "however , the presence of narrow [ o  i ] emission implies the existence of a separate , lower - ionization component .",
    "the region could be of low ionization because of an especially high density , but it is more likely that the region is neutral because the ionizing photons have been used up in the h  ii region .",
    "the intermediate - width component is best exemplified by the [ o  iii ] @xmath634959 , 5007 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) , [ o  ii ] @xmath637320 , 7330 , and [ o  i ] @xmath109 , 6363 emission lines , which all show box - shaped profiles extending to @xmath110 .",
    "the strongest feature in this component at all epochs is the [ o  iii ] @xmath634959 , 5007 blend .",

    "the @xmath365007 line also has a strong feature to the red at @xmath114 ; however , it does not appear in [ o  iii ] @xmath364363 or in other lines of this kinematic component , so there is a question of whether the feature originates from [ o  iii ] or is a blend .",

    "the presence of the o  i recombination line at @xmath367774 is of special interest because it should be accompanied by strong h  i recombination emission with the same line profile , if the emission is from material with `` cosmic '' abundances , since hydrogen is more abundant than oxygen by a factor of @xmath124 in such material .",

    "the emission may be from the oxygen - rich ejecta in the supernova and may extend to relatively high velocity because of hydrodynamic instabilities with the overlying layer ( fryxell et al .",
    "1991 ) and/or a high expansion velocity of the oxygen core (   [ sec_nature ] ) .",

    "as shown in chevalier & fransson ( 1994 , hereinafter cf94 ) , both these alternatives are quite natural , because the [ o  i ] lines are expected to arise in a partially neutral zone of lower temperature ( see , e.g. , cf94 figures 4 and 5 ) .",

    "the broad component is dominated by lines of h  i , he  i , mg  ii , and fe  ii .    the interpretation of the mg  ii @xmath632796 , 2803 doublet is complicated by absorption features arising in gas in our galaxy and in the host galaxy of sn 1995n .",

    "it is especially interesting to note that many of the features can only be identified with fe  ii emission based on models of ly@xmath2 fluorescence of the transitions ( johansson & jordan 1984 ; penston 1987 ; sigut & pradhan 1998a ) .",
    "sigut & pradhan ( 1998b ) , who discuss this process in detail for agns , provide a detailed list of the predicted lines , yielding many identifications for sn 1995n .",
    "the best example of ly@xmath2 fluorescence is probably the feature at @xmath154   , which is difficult to explain with other mechanisms .",
    "based on other paschen lines , a significant contribution of h  i is unlikely , and he  i lines are also excluded by similar arguments , as well as by their wavelengths .",

    "although there are many lines observed with the high - velocity component , the only straightforward diagnostic of the physical conditions is given by the lack of forbidden - line emission .",
    "in the case of the broad - line regions of agns , this is taken to indicate a density @xmath157 ( e.g. , osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "this should be taken with some caution , however , because the gas is only partially ionized by the hard x - rays ( cf94 ) ; high - ionization lines like [ o  iii ] @xmath158 and c  iii ] @xmath159 are therefore unlikely to be present .",
    "the only forbidden lines expected are [ o  i ] @xmath160 , which are suppressed relative to permitted lines for @xmath161 . as we discuss in ",

    "the emission is presumably from a radius that is similar to the radius of the narrow - line emission , and the gas is thus exposed to a radiation field that is comparable to that of the narrow - line gas .",
    "the high density results in an ionization parameter that is a factor @xmath163 smaller than that for the narrow - line gas , or @xmath164 .",
    "the result is low ionization of the gas , as observed .",

    "the he  i @xmath353889 , 7065 lines are also adjusted by a common factor to account for optical - depth effects ( see osterbrock 1989 , p. 105 ) . all lines from metals are calculated as multilevel atoms for a given temperature and density .",
    "the ionization fractions for a given ionization stage ( such as c iii , n iii , o iii , and si iii ) are assumed to be the same .",
    "the continuum is due to h i , he i , and he ii bound - free and two - photon continua , consistent with the recombination lines .",
    "we do not attempt to include the many fe ii lines present , nor lines from the narrow component .",
    "the temperature and ionization are not calculated self - consistently , as in cf94 , so only the relative line fluxes for a given ion , or group of ions , are testing the model . the model should therefore mainly be viewed as a diagnostic tool .    for the line profiles we adjust the variation of the emissivity with velocity so that a best fit is obtained ( eq .

    "the fit gives a good general representation of most lines , in terms of both the relative fluxes and line profiles .",
    "in particular , many of the profiles that seem fairly complicated at first sight are well reproduced as a result of blends by several lines .",

    "compared to figure [ fig5 ] we see that , because of the high oxygen abundance , now both [ o  ii ] @xmath357320 , 7330 and o  i @xmath1847774 , as well as the strengths relative to the h  i lines , are well reproduced .",

    "the relative ratio of the he  i and h  i fluxes results in a he  ii / h  ii abundance of @xmath199 by number . because the he  ii and h  ii ionization zones are likely to coincide ( e.g. , cf94 ) , the he  ii",

    "as can be seen , there is a striking improvement with the observed features between 8000    and 9500    when the fe  ii lines are included . in particular , the feature at @xmath154    can be identified with the fe  ii @xmath359071 , 9128 , 9177 lines , and provides a good fit both in wavelength and profile of the blend .",
    "one of the strongest expected fluorescence - pumped fe  ii lines is at @xmath368451 , and there is indeed a strong feature at this wavelength .",
    "another possible identification for this feature is the recombination line of o  i @xmath368446 .",

    "the ly@xmath97 ",
    "o  i @xmath368446 fluorescence also results in a strengthened o  i @xmath1841300 multiplet .",
    "due to its narrowness , however , this is likely to be absorbed by the o  i in the host galaxy . in our keck day 1007 spectrum of sn 1995n , the center of the emission feature gives a better match to fe  ii @xmath368451 than to o  i @xmath368446 .",
    "an additional argument in favor of this mechanism is that fe  ii @xmath352506 , 2508 , which is indicative of ly@xmath2 pumping , is the strongest fe  ii feature in the uv .",
    "this has previously been seen in @xmath210 carina , rr tel , and kq pup ( baratta , cassatella , & viotti 1995 ; johansson & jordan 1984 ; redfors & johansson 2000 ) .",
    "other lines in the uv expected to be enhanced by fluorescence are the fe  ii multiplets 399 , 391 , and 380 at 2850   , multiplet 373 at 2770   , and multiplet 363 at 2530   .",
    "these most likely contribute to the broad wings of the mg  ii lines , but are too blended to be uniquely identified .",
    "ir lines at @xmath211 m are also expected to be strong ( johansson & hamann 1993 ) , but are outside our observed wavelength range .",
    "given that the model was intended for conditions in an agn , the fit is surprisingly good . only at @xmath212",
    "  are there a few features ( such as at @xmath213   ) which are not well reproduced , but the noise level at these wavelengths is considerable .",
    "one should also note that the relative strengths depend on the uncertain atomic data , as well as on the exact ly@xmath2 profile .",
    "in particular , the larger line width in sn 1995n compared with those assumed in the agn calculation by sigut & pradhan ( 1998a , b ) model can change the results appreciably .",
    "sigut & pradhan assumed a static ly@xmath2 profile with only damping included .",
    "an expanding medium means that the ly@xmath2 line can feed many more fluorescence channels , which is likely to enhance the fluorescence effects .",
    "finally , we note the strong he  i @xmath18410830 line in the day 1769 spectrum .",
    "although the region beyond @xmath214    becomes increasingly noisy , this feature clearly stands out above the noise level .",
    "compared to the strength expected by pure recombination , it is enhanced by collisional excitation by a factor of @xmath193 , which is common in many objects ( e.g. , osterbrock 1989 , p. 111 ) .",
    "in figure [ fig6a ] we show the evolution of the reddening - corrected h@xmath2 luminosity with time on a linear - log scale . we see that the evolution can be well approximated with an exponential decay , @xmath215 , where @xmath216 days .",
    "this is much longer than the @xmath217co decay time scale , and we conclude that the circumstellar interaction is responsible for the longevity , although there is no obvious explanation for this particular time dependence .    an efficient way of displaying the change of the spectrum with time is to plot the ratio of two spectra as a function of wavelength . in figure [ fig7a ]",
    "we show a running average taken over 2    of the day 1799 vlt and day 1007 keck spectra .",
    "the presence of two separate components in the spectrum is apparent . while most of the spectrum has decreased by a factor of @xmath218 , the intermediate - component [ o  i ] , [ o  ii ] , and [ o  iii ] lines only decreased by a factor of 23 .",
    "the o  i @xmath1847774 line shows a similar decrease , while the @xmath1848450 feature follows the h  i lines , consistent with it being mainly due to fe  ii fluorescence lines .",
    "in addition , mg  i ] @xmath1844571 belongs to the class of slowly declining lines .",
    "relative to h@xmath97 , the peak fluxes of the [ o  i ] and [ o  ii ] lines increased by a factor of @xmath219 between 1997 and 1999 , while the [ o  iii ] line increased by a more modest factor of @xmath220 between these observations .",
    "the [ o  iii ] @xmath354959 , 5007/@xmath1844363 ratio remained nearly constant at @xmath221 , while the o  i @xmath1847774/[o  ii ] @xmath357320 , 7330 ratio decreased from @xmath222 to @xmath223 . repeating the analysis in   [ sec_interm ] ( fig . [ fig4a ] ) , we find that the temperature in the oxygen - rich gas had not changed much , while the electron density decreased from @xmath224 to @xmath225 . this is less than expected from a simple @xmath226 law , but our analysis assumes that the relative sizes of the o  ii and o  iii zones remain constant , and that the temperatures and densities in these two zones are similar .",
    "neither of these conditions is obviously satisfied .",
    "in addition , the supernova may be older than our estimate , and the uncertainties in the relative fluxes are considerable .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior is qualitatively that expected for expanding ejecta .    in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we show the relative change of h@xmath2 , [ o  i ] @xmath356300 , 6364 , [ o  ii ] @xmath357320 , 7330 , and [ o  iii ] @xmath354959 , 5007 on a velocity scale . while the [ o  i ] and [ o  ii ] line profiles changed by roughly the same factor over the whole velocity range , @xmath227 to @xmath228 , the red side of the [ o  iii ] line decreased by a large factor relative to the blue .",
    "the most conceivable reason for the rapid [ o  iii ] change is that blending with another line , decreasing similarly to the h  i and he  i component , causes the apparent decrease in the red wing .",
    "the most likely candidates for this are the he  i @xmath355015 , 5049 and fe  ii lines .",
    "the blue side behaved in a manner similar to the [ o  i ] and [ o  ii ] lines .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is little change in the overall profiles of the oxygen lines .",
    "when comparing the width of the best - isolated [ o  ii ] line , we find a nearly constant blue extension , while the width on the red side decreased by @xmath229 during this period .",
    "the evolution of the h@xmath2 line profile differs dramatically from that of the oxygen lines . as shown in the upper - left panel of figure [ fig7 ] , the red wing up to @xmath142 decreased by almost a factor of 4 relative to the blue , with a maximum decrease at @xmath230 . to further illustrate the different evolution of the wings of h@xmath2",

    "[ fighaevol ] ) , so that the blue and red wings can be compared directly .",
    "the fluxes have been normalized to the same peak value .",
    "we see that the day 716 lick spectrum ( dashed lines ) showed nearly identical red and blue wings .",
    "the day 1007 keck spectrum ( solid lines ) shows a clear evolution in that for a given velocity the red wing decreased faster than the blue wing .",
    "this is even more pronounced in the 1999 vlt spectrum , where at @xmath231 the flux of the red wing is only @xmath232% that of the blue wing at the same velocity .",
    "equivalently , for a given intensity the red wing has a much smaller extension .",
    "for example , at @xmath233% of the peak flux the blue wing extends to @xmath234 , while the red wing only extends to @xmath235 .",
    "relative to the peak flux , the blue wing shows a steady increase in flux with time , while the red wing displays the opposite trend .",
    "similar evolution is seen for both h@xmath97 and he  i @xmath1845876 , although the continuum contribution and line blending make it difficult to compare directly to h@xmath2 .",
    "baird et al . (",
    "1998 ) have presented evidence that the line slowly narrows with time .",
    "we can therefore confirm this trend to the latest epochs .",
    "the h@xmath2/h@xmath97 ratio in the 1999 spectra decreased somewhat relative to the 1997 and 1996 spectra .",
    "this is consistent with the decreasing density during this time interval .",
    "the intensity ratio of the he  i lines to the balmer lines does not change much .",
    "the two he  i lines least affected by blending , he  i @xmath355876 , 7065 , have almost the same ratio relative to h@xmath97 at all epochs , and are all reproduced with a relative he  ii / h  ii abundance of @xmath199 by number . together with the similar line profiles , this argues for the fact that the he  i and balmer lines arise in the same region .",
    "their relative flux should therefore reflect their abundance ratio .    in most cases the fluxes of the narrow lines are uncertain , especially in the day 1799 spectrum .",
    "for the strongest lines , like [ o",
    "iii ] @xmath1845007 and [ fe vii ] @xmath1846087 , the decrease is by a factor of 510 , with no systematic distinction between lines from different elements .",
    "although the flux of the [ o  iii ] @xmath236 line is especially uncertain due to the underlying broad component , there is an indication for an increase in the [ o  iii ] @xmath1845007/@xmath1844363 ratio from @xmath237 to @xmath238 . however , because this ratio depends on both density and temperature , one can not directly translate this into a unique change in either of these parameters .",
    "the general scenario for the emission from sn 1995n and related supernovae ( generally type iin ) is interaction of the supernova ejecta with circumstellar gas .",
    "our spectra of sn 1995n show that the interaction is complex , but that there is sufficient diagnostic information on the emission components to deduce some of the interaction details .",
    "all the emission components are likely to be heated and ionized by the energetic radiation from the interaction region .      based on the unresolved line widths ,",
    "the density of @xmath239 , and the low filling factor , the narrow - line emission can be identified with clumps in the preshock circumstellar gas .",
    "the velocity is likely to be @xmath240 , typical of the circumstellar media of red supergiants .",
    "the intermediate - velocity component is identified with unshocked supernova ejecta .",
    "the maximum velocity in this component suggests either that the reverse shock front has a minimum velocity of @xmath241 , or alternatively that the emission is coming from a component which is photoionized by the shock but only extends in abundance to this velocity . the fact that this component is only seen as dense",
    ", oxygen - rich gas makes it natural to identify it as processed gas from the core .",
    "assuming that the oxygen core expands at @xmath113 , the typical oxygen density will be @xmath242 where @xmath102 is the filling factor of this component in the core , and we have assumed an oxygen - dominated composition . with @xmath243 , as was the case for sn 1987a ( e.g. , spyromilio & pinto 1991 ) , the density is of the same order as found from the [ o  iii ] and similar lines .",
    "we note that the density deduced from the models is based on the assumption that the temperatures and densities are the same in the o  i , o  ii , and o  iii zones .",
    "a velocity of @xmath241 is high for the oxygen core of a type iip or type iil supernova , but in the range found in type ib / ic supernovae , as well as in the type iib sn 1993j ( e.g. , houck & fransson 1996 ; matheson et al .",
    "this is an important result because it is consistent with a picture where the progenitor has lost most of its hydrogen - rich envelope before the explosion .",
    "while most of the hydrogen - rich gas comes from gas moving at velocities of @xmath244 , there is a smooth extension to @xmath83 .",
    "any model must explain the wide range of velocities for this component .",
    "in particular , the fact that there appears to be hydrogen - rich , cool gas moving at up to @xmath245 implies that there are some regions where the shock region extends considerably beyond the reverse shock front .    to explain this",
    ", one may identify three main alternatives for the broad , hydrogen - rich component .",
    "the first possibility is that it comes primarily from unshocked , freely expanding ejecta , extending from low - velocity hydrogen in the core up to the maximum ejecta velocity .",
    "a second possibility is that it comes from shocked ejecta gas , behind the reverse shock .",
    "the final possibility is that it comes from shocked circumstellar gas , either in the form of clumps or a more uniform medium . our synthetic spectral models in",
    "  4 are appropriate for the first possibility .    before discussing these possibilities",
    ", we note that the ca  ii lines , the absence of forbidden lines , and the h@xmath2/h@xmath97 ratio indicate a density @xmath157 for this component (   [ sec_result ] ) . a further independent lower limit to the density",
    "can be obtained by considering the state of ionization in this gas .",
    "the luminosity in h@xmath2 was @xmath246 on day 1007 (   [ sec_broad ] ) .",
    "typically , the conversion efficiency from x - rays to h@xmath2 is @xmath247% ( cf94 ) , indicating a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath248 .",
    "this is much more than was observed by _ rosat _ ( fox et al .",
    "2000 ) , but as calculations for sn 1993j showed ( fransson , lundqvist , & chevalier 1996 ) , almost all the x - ray emission can be absorbed in the ejecta and shocked gas , and only the hard x - rays escape the supernova . with this luminosity the ionization parameter on day 1007 is @xmath249 . for a uniform density , hydrogen - dominated envelope expanding at @xmath250 ,",
    "the density is @xmath251 therefore , if the emission came from unshocked ejecta and @xmath252 , the ionization parameter would be very high , @xmath253 , and one would expect strong emission from ions like [ o  iii ] from this component , contrary to the observations . instead , it is dominated by mg  ii and fe  ii emission , in addition to the h  i and he  i lines , characteristic of a partially ionized , high - density region ( e.g. , cf94 ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely to come from a uniform - ejecta component , and only if clumping of this component is very high ( @xmath254 ) is an ejecta origin likely .",
    "we therefore think the first possibility given above is unlikely .",
    "the density in the broad component is much higher than that in the narrow - line component , but the temperature is expected to be only slightly smaller .",
    "the conclusion is that the pressure in the gas is relatively high and one possibility is shocked circumstellar or ejecta gas .",
    "the gas pressure is @xmath255 k , where @xmath256 is the h density in units of @xmath257 and @xmath258 is the temperature in units of @xmath259 k. the pressure generated by a shock front moving into gas with a density of @xmath260 is @xmath261 k , where @xmath262 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath263 . if the emission is from shocks moving into a medium with a density of this order , the required high density can easily be produced .",
    "we can identify two possibilities for such a shocked gas : it could be either clumps caused by instabilities in the shocked ejecta behind the reverse shock , or clumpiness and instabilities of the shocked circumstellar medium .",
    "this is similar to the two scenarios discussed by chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) for sn 1988z .    _",
    "shocked ejecta : _ this is a version of the scenario discussed for `` normal '' interacting supernovae like sn 1979c or sn 1993j ( cf94 ; fransson et al .",
    "the fact that the line profiles in sn 1995n are peaked as opposed to the boxy profiles seen in sn 1993j , however , makes it necessary to modify this scenario .",
    "one possibility is that the circumstellar medium is highly asymmetric , as in the picture discussed by blondin , lundqvist , & chevalier ( 1996 ) .",
    "indications for a highly asymmetric circumstellar medium are seen in some red supergiants in a superwind phase ( see   [ sec_progenitor ] ) .",
    "most of the hydrogen emission could in this case come from the cool , dense shell expected behind the reverse shock ( cf94 ) .",
    "the shape of the h@xmath2 line profile then reflects the decreasing emission measure as one moves away from the equator .",
    "the maximum ejecta velocity is likely to occur at the poles , while the strongest interaction , with most of the energy release , occurs in the high - density circumstellar gas at the equator .",
    "the deceleration of the ejecta will therefore be most rapid here .",
    "if the hydrogen envelope mass is low , the reverse shock at the equator may rapidly recede to the massive oxygen core .",
    "this could qualitatively explain the presence of the high - ionization , oxygen - rich shell observed in the intermediate - component line profiles .",
    "the hydrogen - rich gas in the cool shell behind the reverse shock could then be excited by the x - rays from the shock , giving rise to an extended partially ionized zone .",
    "a prediction is that the maximum velocity of the shocks , and therefore the line widths , should decrease with time .",
    "this general scenario for sn 1995n receives support from observations of the related supernova sn 1986j in ngc 891 , which had a strong h@xmath2 line with fwhm @xmath264 and oxygen lines with widths of several @xmath263 ( leibundgut et al .",
    "it was a strong radio source , and vlbi images showed a shell with protrusions extending at least a factor of two beyond the shell radius ( bartel et al .",
    "1989 , 1991 ) .",
    "images on different dates revealed expansion ; the outer protrusions are moving at @xmath12 , while the shell is expanding at @xmath241 .",
    "these images suggest a picture that is consistent with that deduced from the spectra of sn 1995n .    the origin of the protrusions is uncertain , but there are computational simulations that suggest that they could arise from asymmetries or inhomogeneities in the circumstellar medium .",
    "blondin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that supernova expansion into a circumstellar medium with a density deficit in the polar direction could produce polar protrusions with a radius 24 times that of the main shell .",
    "the problem in comparison to the images of sn 1986j is that there are more than two protrusions .",
    "jun , jones , & norman ( 1996 ) carried out a simulation of the interaction of a supernova with a clumpy medium and found that the rayleigh - taylor instability that develops where the ejecta are decelerated by the surrounding medium is accentuated by the presence of clumps .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor fingers reach the outer shock front .",
    "the protrusions in the simulation did not reach the extent required for sn 1986j , but the simulation was run for a limited amount of time and the density of the surrounding medium was uniform . the circumstellar wind case remains to be investigated .",
    "_ shocked circumstellar clouds : _ in this scenario , the emission comes from the cool gas behind the slow radiative shocks propagating into the same clumpy gas clouds as are responsible for the narrow - line emission .",
    "the blast wave may then propagate in the intercloud medium , while the high - density circumstellar clumps are left behind . the maximum ejecta velocity will decrease only slowly , while the shocked clouds will be accelerated on a time scale which depends on the column density of the clouds .",
    "as simulations show ( e.g. , klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ; jun et al . 1996 ) , however , the cloud may gradually be evaporated , and finally be dissolved and merge with the ejecta gas . in this scenario one",
    "expects a smooth distribution of gas , with velocities ranging from newly shocked clouds with low velocity , or clouds with very high column density , to gas which has been accelerated to the ejecta velocity .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the observed h@xmath2 line profile .",
    "the observed gradual increase of the flux in the blue wing with time is also consistent with this scenario .",
    "the decrease in the red wing , however , is not naturally explained , unless it is caused by dust absorption , either from pre - existing dust in the circumstellar gas , or from newly formed dust in the ejecta , as discussed for sn 1998s by gerardy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "an important question is the location of the energy source for the excitation of the gas , and there are several possibilities .",
    "first , the source could be the shock separating the high - velocity hydrogen ejecta from the circumstellar gas . in the uniform - medium case",
    "this will be at the highest velocity and also maximum ejecta radius .",
    "this is the model discussed by cf94 , and applied to sn 1993j by fransson et al .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand the presence of the high - ionization , oxygen - rich shell at only @xmath265 , since most of the x - rays will be absorbed by the unprocessed ejecta between the shock and the oxygen core .    in the clumped circumstellar medium case",
    "the bow shocks may be distributed over a large radius , and immersed in the expanding ejecta , depending on the time of shocking and their column densities .",
    "the oxygen - shell emission is again difficult to explain .",
    "it may , however , explain the distributed nature of the hydrogen emission .",
    "some clues to realistic scenarios for the structure of the circumstellar medium can be obtained from observations of galactic supergiants in very advanced evolutionary stages . while most red supergiants , like @xmath2 ori , have fairly modest winds with mass - loss rates @xmath266 , there is a handful of massive stars having more extreme mass - loss rates , @xmath267 , often referred to as `` superwinds . ''",
    "van loon et al .  ( 1999 ) find that two out of eight red supergiants in an lmc sample have mass - loss rates @xmath268 , while the others have moderate mass - loss rates @xmath266 .",
    "the best - studied superwind cases are vy cma and irc + 10420 .",
    "the nature of the superwind phase is not yet clear , but can be related either to a specific evolutionary phase , occurring for most red supergiants , or to a phase only occurring for a specific mass range .",
    "a hint that the latter is the case comes from the fact that both vy cma and irc + 10420 are very luminous stars , with @xmath269 . from evolutionary models",
    "wittkowski , langer , & weigelt ( 1998 ) estimate a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass of 3040 @xmath270 for vy cma .",
    "the mass - loss rate is determined to be @xmath271 for a wind velocity of @xmath272 ( danchi et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "several authors have found an asymmetric distribution of the circumstellar gas and dust around vy cma . from _",
    "hst _ imaging kastner & weintraub ( 1998 ) find an asymmetric core region with wavelength dependent fwhm @xmath273 cm in the optical .",
    "the star itself has a radius of @xmath274 cm . outside of",
    "this is an asymmetric reflection nebula with an extent of @xmath275 cm , with the core close to its edge .",
    "based on symmetry arguments , kastner & weintraub speculate that this is only one half of a bipolar nebula , with the other half obscured by an opaque equatorial dust disk .",
    "the same conclusion is reached by monnier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from high - resolution observations of the core and extended structure .",
    "the supergiant irc + 10420 is similar to vy cma in terms of mass - loss rate and mass , but probably in an even later evolutionary state , intermediate between a red supergiant and a wolf - rayet star .",
    "there is also evidence for a disk - like geometry in this case , based on line profiles ( jones et al .",
    "1993 ) and on _ hst _ and ir imaging ( humphreys et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "wittkowski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) propose that the asymmetric mass loss arises as a result of rapid rotation in the phase preceding the evolution off the hayashi line when the major part of the envelope is lost .",
    "vy cma is now estimated to have a mass of @xmath276 , meaning that it has lost @xmath277 to the circumstellar medium .",
    "the helium fraction at this phase is @xmath278 by mass .",
    "this is lower than , although qualitatively consistent with , our results for sn 1995n , but is obviously sensitive to mixing prescriptions , the exact evolutionary status , and other factors . as an alternative , soker ( 2000 ) proposes that the asymmetric distribution is caused by the concentration of magnetic spots in the equatorial plane , which through the lower photospheric temperature causes dust formation preferentially at the equator .",
    "based on these cases , it seems probable that sn 1995n , and other type iin supernovae , arise from progenitors similar to vy cma or irc + 10420 .",
    "this is consistent with the high mass - loss rates needed to explain the strong interaction , as reflected in the total luminosity .",
    "a low hydrogen envelope mass is needed to explain the large oxygen core velocity .",
    "the observed high he / h ratio is also consistent with high mass loss .",
    "an asymmetric circumstellar distribution will result in faster expansion of the supernova ejecta in the polar directions , while it will be slowed down by the equatorial disk or torus as modeled by blondin et al .",
    "the radius of the inner boundary of the dusty disk in vy cma is estimated to be @xmath279 cm ( monnier et al .",
    "if the density in the disk is large enough , the radius of the inner edge would not be much affected by the supernova ejecta .",
    "the relative size of the ejecta and obscuring disk would therefore increase with time .",
    "if the disk is opaque due to dust , an increasingly large fraction of the ejecta on the far side of the supernova would be obscured .",
    "this could explain the fact that the red side of the h@xmath2 line decreased considerably faster than the blue side .",
    "the exact temporal evolution depends on the degree of asymmetry of the ejecta .",
    "evidence for dusty environments comes from several type ii supernovae .",
    "especially interesting are the observations of sn 1998s , where gerardy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find strong evidence for dust emission .",
    "as gerardy et al .",
    "discuss , although this dust could in principle be formed in the ejecta , perhaps a more likely interpretation is pre - existing circumstellar dust , heated by the supernova ( see also fassia et al .",
    "2001 ) .    from observations of h@xmath280o masers in vy cma , richards , yates , & cohen ( 1998 ) estimate a density of @xmath281 in the masing regions , while other species give a density of @xmath282 , indicating a considerable clumpiness of the circumstellar medium .",
    "one then speculates that these masing regions could be related to the high - density clumps needed to decelerate the supernova blast wave . finally , the small fraction of supernovae in this class , @xmath283% ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1993 ) , is at least qualitatively consistent with them coming from a fairly small fraction of the high - mass stars .",
    "late - time spectral observations of sn 1995n are presented , covering the uv to near - ir regions .",
    "three kinematic components are found , which most likely are powered by x - rays from the interaction of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium of the progenitor .",
    "spectral modeling shows evidence of an increased helium abundance , as well as cno burning .",
    "the first evidence for ly@xmath2 pumped fluorescence of fe  ii lines in supernovae is found .",
    "it is likely that other supernovae interacting with their circumstellar media show similar signatures , especially in the near - ir . while the narrow lines come from unshocked circumstellar gas and the intermediate - velocity component from processed ejecta , the high - velocity unprocessed gas has a more uncertain origin .",
    "different possibilities based on either clumpy or asymmetric circumstellar media are discussed , without strongly favoring either of these possibilities .",
    "the temporal evolution of the processed and unprocessed gas is distinctly different , again emphasizing the different origins of these components .",
    "we propose that the progenitors of the narrow - line supernovae ( type iin ) are similar to red supergiants in their superwind phase , as most of the hydrogen - rich gas is expelled in the last @xmath284 years before explosion .",
    "this explains the high oxygen core velocity .",

    "<S> the he / h ratio , @xmath3 by number , and the nitrogen overabundance provide strong evidence for cno burning products . </S>",
