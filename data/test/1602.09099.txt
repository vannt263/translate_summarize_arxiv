    "recently , the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations have both reported an excess in the diphoton channel near @xmath0  gev . with an integrated luminosity of 3.2 @xmath2 ,",
    "the atlas collaboration has observed a local @xmath3 excess at a diphoton invariant mass of around 747  gev , assuming a narrow width resonance . for a wider width resonance ,",
    "the signal significance increases to @xmath4 with a preferred width of about 45  gev . with an integrated luminosity of 2.6 @xmath2 ,",
    "the cms collaboration has also observed a diphoton excess with a local significance of @xmath5 at invariant mass of around 760 gev . assuming a decay width of around 45  gev , the significance reduces to @xmath6 in this case .",
    "the corresponding excesses in the cross section can be roughly estimated as @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "while this is well below the threshold to claim a discovery , this excess could be the first signal of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "as such , it is worthwhile to consider possible models of new physics which may explain the excess . indeed , many groups have proposed such possible explanations  @xcite    perhaps the simplest explanation for the excess is the addition of a sm singlet scalar with a mass near @xmath0  gev along with additional vector - like multiplets of colored particles . with this set - up , the singlet may be produced via gluon fusion with the vector - like particles appearing in loops .",
    "similarly , the singlet may decay to diphotons .",
    "however , in order to preserve gauge coupling unification as in supersymmetric versions of the sm , these vector - like states should come in complete multiplets of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , to preserve unification and avoid landau poles , the types and numbers of @xmath1 multiplets is restricted  @xcite .",
    "such light vector - like multiplets are often found in models constructed within the framework of string theory@xcite . indeed",
    ", vector - like states are generically present in intersecting / magnetized d - brane models on orientifold backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "one such model satisfying all global consistency conditions has been constructed from intersecting / magnetized d - branes within the context of type ii orientifold compactifications  @xcite on a @xmath8 background .",
    "this model corresponds to the mssm with three generations of quarks and leptons as well as a single pair of higgs fields .",
    "the model contains a minimal amount of exotic matter , which may be decoupled from the low - energy sector .",
    "in addition , the tree - level gauge couplings are automatically unified at the string scale  @xcite .",
    "finally , the yukawa couplings are allowed by global @xmath9 symmetries , and it is possible to obtain correct masses and mixings for quarks and charged leptons .",
    "thus , this is a phenomenologically interesting model worthy of detailed study .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly summarize the intersecting d - brane model under study , which is a variation of the model discussed above .",
    "it is shown that vector - like quarks are present in the model , and that these states may appear in complete multiplets of @xmath1 so that gauge coupling unification may be maintained .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that there are sm singlets in the model which have yukawa couplings to the vector - like quarks and leptons .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is a non - trivial result as these fields carry global @xmath9 charges , under which the yukawa coupling must be neutral .",
    "finally , we show that the diphoton excesses can be accomodated in the model .",
    "a phenomenologically interesting intersecting d - brane model has been studied in refs .  @xcite .",
    "a variation of this model with a different hidden sector was also studied in refs .",
    "type iia orientifold string compactifications with intersecting d - branes ( and their type iib duals with magnetized d - branes ) have provided exciting geometric tools with which the mssm may be engineered .",
    "while this approach may not allow a first - principles understanding of why the sm gauge groups and associated matter content arises , it may allow a deeper insight into how the finer phenomenological details of the sm may emerge .",
    "in short , d6-branes in type iia fill ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime and wrap 3-cycles in the compactified manifold , such that a stack of @xmath10 branes generates a gauge group u(@xmath10 ) [ or u(@xmath11 ) in the case of @xmath12 in its world volume .    in general , the 3-cycles wrapped by the stacks of d6-branes intersect multiple times in the internal space , resulting in a chiral fermion in the bifundamental representation localized at the intersection between different stacks @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the multiplicity of such fermions is then given by the number of times the 3-cycles intersect .",
    "each stack of d6-branes @xmath13 may intersect the orientifold images of other stacks @xmath15 , also resulting in fermions in bifundamental representations .",
    "each stack may also intersect its own image @xmath16 , resulting in chiral fermions in the symmetric and antisymmetric representations .",
    "non - chiral matter may also be present between stacks of d - branes which do not intersect on one two - torus .",
    "a zero intersection number between two stacks of branes implies that the branes are parallel on at least one torus . at such kind of intersection additional non - chiral ( vector - like )",
    "multiplet pairs from @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 can arise .",
    "global consistency of the model requires certain constraints to be satisfied , namely , ramond - ramond ( r - r ) tadpole cancellation and the preservation of @xmath20 supersymmetry .",
    "in particular , the conditions for preserving @xmath20 supersymmetry fixes the complex structure parameters .",
    ".d6-brane configurations and intersection numbers for a three - family pati - salam model on a type - iia @xmath21 orientifold , with a tilted third two - torus .",
    "the complete gauge symmetry is @xmath22_{\\rm observable } \\times [ { \\rm u}(2 ) \\times { \\rm usp}(2)^2]_{\\rm hidden}$ ] and @xmath20 supersymmetry is preserved for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "vector - like matter appears in intersecting / magnetized d - brane models on toroidal orientifolds between stacks of d - branes which do not intersect .",
    "the mass of such vector - like states depends upon the separation between the stacks of d - branes in the internal space . as such",
    ", it is generically massive .",
    "only stacks of d - branes which are directly on top of one another have massless vector - like states between them . in the model studied in section ii , the toroidal orientifold consist of a six - torus which is factorizable , @xmath26 .",
    "if two stacks of d - branes are parallel on one two - torus , then vector - like matter appears in the bifundamental representation of the gauge groups within the world - volume of each stack . if the two stacks are not separated on the two torus on which they are parallel , the vector - like multiplets are massless",
    "however , these states become massive if the stacks are separated .",
    "the most straightforward way to obtain the diphoton excesses is with a sm singlet scalar with a mass @xmath27  gev coupled to vector - like quarks .",
    "the coupling to vector - like quarks is necessary in order to produce the scalar via gluon fusion and to allow the decay of the scalar into diphotons .",
    "the requisite vector - like quarks are indeed present in the model . in particular , the vector - like quarks and leptons in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 sector fill @xmath30 and @xmath31 spinorial representations of so(10 ) , or equivalently @xmath32 of su(5 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath33    it is well - known that gauge coupling unification may be preserved at the 1-loop level if the extra matter comes in complete representations of @xmath1 . however , at the 2 or 3-loop level , a landau pole may appear .",
    "this restricts the number of @xmath1 multiplets which may remain light to either one @xmath34 or three copies of @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , any number of sm singlets may be present in the light spectrum .",
    "generically , there are many more vector - like states in the spectrum , as can be seen from tables  [ vector - likespectrummssm1],[vector - likespectrummssm2 ] , and [ vector - likespectrummssm3 ] .",
    "thus , in order to preserve gauge coupling unification , many of these states must obtain string - scale masses , while simultaneously maintaining light masses for either of the two cases stated above . recalling that vector - like matter appears between stacks of d - branes which are parallel on one two - torus , the masses of these vector - like states depend on the separation between the stacks on the two - torus on which they are parallel .",
    "so , it is possible to give string - scale masses to some of the vector - like states by separating the two stacks of d - branes on the two - torus on which they are parallel and where these vector - like states are localized .",
    "is it possible to choose the position of the stacks of d - branes so that only the @xmath36 or @xmath37 fields remain light ?",
    "the answer to this question is yes . as an example , let us consider just the fields in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 sectors , where it should be noted that these stacks of d - branes are parallel on the third two - torus .",
    "thus , for example the fields @xmath38 may become massive by separating stacks @xmath39 and @xmath15 on the third torus .",
    "similarly , the fields @xmath40 may become massive by separating stacks @xmath39 and @xmath41 , while @xmath42 become massive if stacks @xmath43 and @xmath44 are separated on the third two - torus .",
    "the fields @xmath45 may remain massless if stacks @xmath39 and @xmath44 overlap on the third two - torus , and the same is true for @xmath46 if stacks",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath15 overlap on the third two - torus .",
    "thus with this configuration , only the fields in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) representations of eq .  [ abvector ] remain light .    in addition , there are additional vector - like quarks and leptons in the spectrum in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 sectors , as shown in tables  [ vector - likespectrummssm2 ] and  [ vector - likespectrummssm3 ]",
    ". these fields may also become massive by separating the relevant stacks of d - branes on the two - torus where they are parallel .",
    "for example , stacks @xmath39 and @xmath43 are parallel with stacks @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the third two - torus , and so the vector - like matter in these sectors may be eliminated if these stacks are separated on the third two - torus .",
    "similarly , stacks @xmath39 and @xmath43 are parallel with stacks @xmath54 and @xmath55 on the second two - torus , and the vector - like matter in this sector may be eliminated by displacing these stacks on the second two - torus .    on the other hand",
    ", it must also be kept in mind that splitting the stacks in this fashion may affect the higgs sectors , which are also vector - like .",
    "for example the higgs fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 arise from vector - like matter in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 sectors respectively .",
    "stackss @xmath39 and @xmath44 must overlap to keep @xmath60 light while stacks @xmath39 and @xmath15 must be separated to give masses to the fields @xmath61 ) such that the light vector - like fields may be placed in @xmath36 representations .",
    "however , this implies that stacks @xmath14 and @xmath62 must be separated and thus that the higgs field @xmath57 is not present in the light spectrum .",
    "clealy , then it is not possible to eliminate the fields in the @xmath63 while keeping the fields in the @xmath64 without also eliminating some of the higgs field .",
    "note that this constraint only applies to those fields in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 sectors . in the next section",
    ", we shall also consider the vector - like matter in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 sectors .",
    "we shall find that it is possible to have just vector - like matter in the @xmath64 representation without eliminating some of the higgs fields as a by - product .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the model contains vector - like quarks and leptons in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 sectors which may be grouped into complete representations of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , by displacing the stacks of d - branes , it is possible to eliminate some of these fields from the spectrum so that only three copies of @xmath65 remain light . in this way",
    ", gauge coupling unification may be maintained while also avoiding the landau pole problem .",
    "however , upon inspection , none of these vector - like quarks and leptons appear to have yukawa couplings with any of the singlet fields present in the model .",
    "therefore , they may not be involved in producing the diphoton excesses . however",
    ", this is not the case if we examine the vector - like quarks and leptons present in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 sectors .",
    "let us turn our attention to the sm singlet fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 shown in table  [ hiddenspectrum ] .",
    "these fields have yukawa couplings with the vector - like quarks in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 sectors : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are near the string scale @xmath71 as discussed in section i. in addition , there are yuakwa couplings between these singlets and some of the vector - like doublets : @xmath72 finally , there are additional yukawa couplings between @xmath66 and @xmath67 and the singlet fields in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 sectors : @xmath75 thus , the required couplings of the sm singlet fields to vector - like quarks are present so that the singlet fields may be produced by gluon fusion and decay to diphotons . in addition , the singlet fields have additional couplings to other doublet and singlet fields .",
    "note that the vector - like quarks involved in these couplings combined with additional vector - like matter may be placed in complete representations of @xmath1 by replacing the right - handed vector - like quarks , leptons , and singlets in eq .",
    "[ abvector ] with some of the quarks , leptons and singlets of tables  [ vector - likespectrummssm2 ] and  [ vector - likespectrummssm3 ] .",
    "for example , making the interchanges @xmath76 we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and making the interchanges @xmath79 we have @xmath80 in order to have just three @xmath65 multiplets + additional singlets in the light spectrum , the fields grouped into the @xmath81 multiplets must become massive , as well as any additional vector - like states . to eliminate the vectorlike fields in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 sectors from the light spectrum , we must require that stacks @xmath39 and @xmath43 are separated from stacks @xmath15 , @xmath41 , and @xmath44 on the third two - torus .",
    "futhermore , to eliminate the fields in the above @xmath37 , we require that stack @xmath39 be separated from stack @xmath52 on the third two - torus and from @xmath54 on the second two - torus .",
    "let us also require that stack @xmath43 be separated from both stacks @xmath52 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath55 .    to keep the fields in the above @xmath65 representations light",

    "in addition , stack @xmath14 may not overlap stack @xmath54 since stack @xmath39 overlaps stack @xmath52 .",
    "since stack @xmath39 and @xmath15 are separated , this implies that stacks @xmath14 and @xmath54 are also separated .    then , the fields in the light spectrum consist of the following fields with quantum numbers under the @xmath85 gauge symmetry shown : @xmath86 plus additional singlets . as shown in eq .",

    "note that the cross - sections @xmath111 and @xmath112 in tables  [ tab:5gev ] - [ tab:45gev ] display a gain of 4.65 from 8  tev to 13  tev .",
    "we use values of the coupling constants at the @xmath359 scale in our calculations of @xmath360 and @xmath361 .",
    "the diphoton and digluon decay modes are only a small portion of the total decay width , as shown in tables  [ tab:5gev ] - [ tab:45gev ] .",
    "these practical constraints on the diphoton and digluon decay widths allocate the majority of the total width to the other decay channels , for instance , to dark matter invisibly and/or @xmath362 and @xmath363 , kinematically allowed for both @xmath95 and @xmath332 less than 375  gev , which is reflected in the @xmath106 decay width and @xmath364 branching ratio in tables  [ tab:5gev ] - [ tab:45gev ] . specifically , the decay width for the decay into pairs of fermions @xmath365 is given by @xmath366 where we take @xmath367 and @xmath368 in the calculations .",
    "we have studied the diphoton excesses near @xmath0  gev recently reported by the atlas and cms collaborations within the context of a phenomenologically interesting intersecting / magnetized d - brane model on a toroidal orientifold .",
    "we have shown that the model contains a sm singlet scalar as well as vector - like quarks and leptons .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the singlet scalar has yukawa couplings with vector - like quarks and leptons such that it may be produced in proton - proton collisions via gluon fusion as well as decay to diphotons through loops involving the vector - like quarks . moreover , the required vector - like quarks and leptons may appear in complete @xmath1 multiplets so that gauge coupling unification may be maintained . in particuar",
    ", we showed that we may have three copies of @xmath65 representations of @xmath1 in the light spectrum which are present in the model .",
    "finally , we showed that the diphoton excesses observed by the atlas and cms collaborations may be accommodated .",
    "it should be emphasized that we have obtained these results within the context of a complete , globally consistent string model .",
    "this particular model has many interesting phenomenological features such as automatic gauge coupling unification , realistic yukawa mass matrices for quarks and leptons , and mimimal exotic matter .",
    "it is of note that the singlet fields required to explain the diphoton signal arise from this extra matter . in addition , the required vector - like quarks are naturally present in the spectrum .",
    "finally , the yukawa couplings between the singlet fields and the vector - like quarks are allowed by the global symmetries arising from @xmath9 factors whose gauge bosons become heavy at the string scale via the green - schwarz mechanism , a result which is completely non - trivial .",
    "an interesting question is whether or not is it possible to obtain supersymmetry partner spectra from the model which take into account the light vector - like matter . as mentioned earlier , the vector - like quarks and leptons have yukawa couplings with the higgs fields in the model , and thus may raise the higgs mass by up to a few gev .",
    "this may alleviate the problem with electroweak fine - tuning .",
    "in addition , the vector - like matter affects the rge running of the soft masses .",
    "finally , the soft supersymmetry breaking masses may be calculated at the string scale in the model .",
    "thus , it would be very interesting to study the possible supersymmetry partner spectra obtainable in the model including the extra vector - like matter .",
    "we plan to study this in future work .",
