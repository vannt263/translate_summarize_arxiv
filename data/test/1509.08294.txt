    ", the scattering rate @xmath42 has been shown to increase when moving from nodal to antinodal regions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the photoemission lineshape broadens and the pseudogap increases when doping is reduced from the overdoped side of the phase diagram  @xcite . the same trend has been reported by stm studies of the density - of - states  @xcite . the exact experimental relation between scattering and pseudogap ( normal state gap ) has , however , not been discussed much  @xcite . a correlation between scattering and the spectral gap",
    "has previously been predicted by dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) calculations for the hubbard model  @xcite . within the dmft approach  @xcite , the pseudogap emerges from electron correlations as a primary effect that , in turn , enhances the tendency for the system to undergo superconducting and charge - density - wave instabilities , at lower temperatures",
    "notice however that , as opposed to superconductivity , charge order has not yet been found directly in dmft calculations .    from a different point of view , the pseudogap ( normal state gap ) emerges as a precursor to superconductivity  @xcite , or as a precursor to an order competing with superconductivity  @xcite . in bi2201 , for example , the charge ordering onset temperature is comparable to the pseudogap temperature scale @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a connection between the charge ordering vector and the vector nesting the fermi arc tips was found  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a possibility that the pseudogap is related to fluctuating cdw order . in two - dimensional cdw systems ,",
    "spectral gaps are indeed observed above the cdw onset temperature  @xcite . in cuprates , however , the single particle gap originating from cdw order has not been clearly elucidated by arpes experiments .",
    "it is therefore interesting to discuss the spectral lineshapes at the 1/8-doping , where the charge order parameter has its maximum ( fig .",
    "1 ) . charge order  in principle  should open a single - particle gap somewhere on the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the stripe ordered ground state found in nd - lsco is identical to that of la@xmath15ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lbco ) and la@xmath57eu@xmath58sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( eu - lsco ) with @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "all three systems have the same low - temperature tetragonal crystal structure , similar thermopower  @xcite , and the same spin / charge stripe structure  @xcite . at the particular 1/8 doping  due",
    "to phase competition  charge stripe order suppresses almost completely superconductivity .",
    "arpes studies on these stripe ordered systems commonly report anti - nodal spectra with little low - energy spectral weight  @xcite .",
    "different interpretations have been put forward  @xcite . in lbco",
    "it was suggested that the pseudogap ( normal state gap ) has @xmath60-wave character and that the gap amplitude @xmath9 is maximized at 1/8-doping  @xcite ( this result is reproduced in fig .",
    "subsequent experiments reported a correction to the @xmath60-wave symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this led to the proposal of a two - gap scenario  @xcite , with an additional spectral gap ( of unknown origin ) in the anti - nodal region  @xcite . in nd - lsco",
    "@xmath34 , fermi arcs with finite length were found even at the lowest measured temperatures  @xcite . to access the intrinsic spectral evolution as a function of momentum in nd - lsco @xmath34 ,",
    "background subtracted data should be considered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](i ) , spectra near the anti - nodal region and close to the tip of the fermi arc are compared .",

    "( 2 ) yields @xmath61  mev and a scattering constant @xmath62  mev .",
    "this is consistent with the approximate constant ratio of @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) found for nd - lsco @xmath6 .",
    "the lineshape of the anti - nodal spectra is , however , dramatically modified .",
    "a similar evolution was found in lbco  @xcite .",
    "it seems that the system has lost coherence .",
    "fitting using eq .",
    "2 , indeed yields much smaller ratios of @xmath63  see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "a sudden quasiparticle decoherence effect is therefore one possible explanation for the different anti - nodal lineshape observed in the underdoped regime .",
    "next , we discuss the possible influence of static long - range charge density - wave order . for conventional cdw systems , the order parameter is identical to the single - particle gap  @xcite , and @xmath14 scales with the lattice distortion @xmath64  @xcite . by measuring this distortion using hard x - ray diffraction ,",
    "it was found that @xmath14 has a strong doping dependence  @xcite ( reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b )  peaking sharply at the 1/8-doping .",
    "just a slight increase of doping , to say @xmath33 , results in a single - particle gap @xmath14 renormalized by a factor of five  @xcite ( compared to 1/8-doping ) .",
    "notice that the charge stripe onset temperature @xmath13  observed by x - ray diffraction  varies more smoothly with doping .",
    "hence , the coupling constant @xmath65 has a strong doping dependence  being largest at 1/8 doping .",
    "it is also around this doping that quantum oscillation  @xcite and transport  @xcite experiments have revealed the fermi surface reconstruction in ybco and hg1201 .",
    "charge ordering has been proposed as the mechanism responsible for this reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "strongly coupled charge order is therefore not necessarily in contradiction with the observation of quasiparticles with light masses .",
    "interestingly , neither the fermi surface reconstruction nor the effect of charge order have been convincingly probed by photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "the observation of an electronic fermi surface reconstruction is complicated by orthorhombic distortions , that fold the bands similarly to what is expected from density - wave orders  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "identification of charge density wave order effects on the antinodal lineshape in very underdoped compounds is complicated by superconductivity , pseudogaps and possibly also spin - freezing phenomena  @xcite . the choice of nd - lsco ensures , due to it s low @xmath28 , that superconductivity is not influencing the problem .",
    "furthermore , in this system spin and charge density wave orderings are coupled  @xcite , and hence part of the same phenomenon .    when a spectral gap @xmath9 opens , low - energy spectral weight is either suppressed or redistributed in @xmath66-space",
    "it has , for example , been shown that in bi2212 , pronounced redistribution of spectral weight  extending beyond 200 mev  appears inside the pseudogap  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]b , antinodal spectra of nd - lsco @xmath6 display how the normal state gap opens upon cooling .",
    "as the gap opens , spectral weight is transferred to larger energies , while the total amount of spectral weight remains approximately constant .",
    "this rearrangement of spectral weight manifests itself within an energy scale @xmath67  mev . in the anti - nodal regime of stripe",
    "ordered nd - lsco @xmath34 , within the same temperature and energy window , the behaviour is very different ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5]a ) . upon cooling ,",
    "low - energy ( @xmath68  mev ) spectral weight is removed with an apparent net loss of total weight .",
    "the @xmath69dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c , i ) , does not suggest any pile up of spectral weight at other locations in momentum space .",
    "thus either spectral weight is transferred to @xmath70 , or it is simply not conserved .",
    "a system that undergoes a phase transition may not display spectral weight conservation .",
    "appearance of charge stripe order in the low - temperature tetragonal crystal structure may therefore lead to effective loss of spectral weight . in that case",
    ", stripe order seems to influence mainly the anti - nodal region and , remarkably , suppression of spectral weight extends up to energies as large as 100  mev .",
    "in summary , we have presented a systematic angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy , normal state study of the charge stripe ordered cuprate compound la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( nd - lsco ) . by varying the doping concentration ,",
    "antinodal spectra were recorded from the overdoped metallic phase to the 1/8-doping  where static charge stripe order is stabilized .",
    "the metallic phase is characterized by gapless excitations even in the antinodal region . at @xmath4 ,",
    "a spectral gap @xmath71  mev opens in the antinodal region but spectral weight remains conserved , although shifted to slightly larger energies .",
    "analysis of the line shape suggests a correlation between electron scattering and the gap amplitude .",
    "finally , for underdoped compounds the anti - nodal lineshape is quite different . upon cooling into the stripe",
