    "<S> we fit the ( quasi-)simultaneous multi - waveband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for a sample of low - synchrotron - peaked ( lsp ) blazars with a one - zone leptonic model . </S>",
    "<S> the seed photons that predominantly come from broad line region ( blr ) and infrared ( ir ) molecular torus are considered respectively in external compton process . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the modeling with ir seed photons is systematically better than that with blr photons based on a @xmath0 test , which suggest that @xmath1-ray emitting region most possibly stay outside the blr . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum electron lorentz factor , @xmath2 , is constrained from the modeling for these lsp blazars with good soft x - ray data ( ranges from 5 to 160 with a median value of 55 ) , which plays a key role in jet power estimation . </S>",
    "<S> assuming one - to - one ratio of proton and electron , we find that the jet power for lsp blazars is systematically higher than that of fr ii radio galaxies at given 151 mhz radio luminosity , @xmath3 , even though fr iis are regarded as same as lsp blazars in unification scheme except the jet viewing angle . </S>",
    "<S> the possible reason is that there are some @xmath4 pairs in the jet of these blazars . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , we find the number density of @xmath4 pairs should be several times higher than that of @xmath5 pairs by assuming the jet power is the same for lsp blazars and fr iis at given @xmath3 . </S>"
