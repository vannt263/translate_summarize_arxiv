    "one of the most remarkable observational results in the last three decades in cosmology is the lack of the gunn  peterson trough in the spectra of high  redshift quasars and galaxies .",
    "this finding implies that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is highly ionized at least out to @xmath5 , the redshift of the most distant known quasars and galaxies ly@xmath6 emission lines , implying @xmath7 ( see discussion below ) . ] .",
    "since the primeval plasma recombined at @xmath8 , its subsequent ionization requires some form of energy injection into the igm , naturally attributable to astrophysical sources .",
    "the two most popular examples of such sources are an early generation of stars , residing in sub  galactic size clusters ( hereafter `` mini  galaxies '' ) , or accreting massive ( @xmath9 ) black holes in small ( @xmath10 ) halos ( hereafter `` mini  quasars '' ) .",
    "reionization is interesting for a variety of reasons .",
    "first , the most fundamental questions are still unanswered : what type of sources caused reionization , and around what redshift did it occur ?",
    "how were the reionizing sources distributed relative to the gas ?",
    "what was the size , geometry , and topology of the ionized zones , and how did these properties evolve ?",
    "second , and more directly relevant to the topic of this review , reionization leaves distinctive signatures on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) through the interaction between the cmb photons and free electrons .",
    "although it may complicate the extraction of cosmological parameters from cmb data , this `` contamination '' could yield important information on the ionization history of the igm . through reionization ,",
    "the cmb is a useful probe of nonlinear processes in the high  redshift universe .",
    "thomson scattering from free electrons affects the cmb in several ways . because the scattering leads to a blending of photons from initially different lines of sight",
    ", there is a damping of the _ primary _ temperature anisotropy . on the other hand , a new _ secondary _",
    "anisotropy is generated by what can be thought of as a doppler effect : as photons scatter off free electrons , they pick up some of their peculiar momentum .",
    "finally , the polarization dependence of the thomson cross section creates new polarization from the initially anisotropic photon field .",
    "the inhomogeneity of reionization affects these processes in two different ways .",
    "first , the inhomogeneity of the medium affects how the _ mean _ ionization fraction evolves with time .",
    "this is important since the damping , doppler and polarization effects all occur even in the idealized case of spatially homogeneous reionization .",
    "secondly , the spatial fluctuations in the ionization fraction can greatly enhance the contribution from the doppler effect at small angular scales .",
    "polarization and damping are much less influenced by the inhomogeneity , as we will see below .",
    "the aim of the present review is to summarize our current knowledge of reionization , describe the possible connections to the cmb , and assess what we can hope to learn about the high  redshift igm from forthcoming observations of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "if the igm was neutral , its optical depth to ly@xmath6 absorption would be exceedingly high : + @xmath11^{3/2}$ ] , wiping out the flux from any source at observed wavelengths shorter than @xmath12 .",
    "the spectra of high  redshift quasars and galaxies reveal ly@xmath6 absorption by numerous discrete ly@xmath6 forest clouds , separated in redshift , rather than the continuous gunn  peterson ( gp ) trough expected from a neutral igm .",
    "the detection of the continuum flux in  between the ly@xmath6 clouds implies that @xmath13 is at most of order unity , or , equivalently , an upper limit on the average neutral fraction of @xmath14 .",
    "the intergalactic medium is therefore highly ionized .",
    "note that there is no sharp physical distinction between the intergalactic medium and the low column density ( @xmath15 ) ly@xmath6 forest ( reisenegger & miralda - escud 1995 ) .",
    "these ly@xmath6 clouds fill most of the volume of the universe , are highly ionized , and account for most of the baryons ( implied by big bang nucleosynthesis ) at high redshift ( weinberg et al .",
    "1997 ; rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the energy requirement of reionization can easily be satisfied either by the first mini  galaxies or mini  quasars .",
    "nuclear burning inside stars releases several mev per hydrogen atom , and thin  disk accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole releases ten times more energy , while the ionization of a hydrogen atom requires only 13.6 ev .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to convert a fraction of @xmath16 of the baryonic mass into either stars or black holes in order to ionize the rest of the baryons in the universe . in a homogeneous universe ,",
    "the ratio of recombination time to hubble time in the igm is @xmath17^{-3/2}$ ] so that each h atom would only recombine a few times at most until the present time . unless reionization occurred at @xmath18",
    ", recombinations therefore would not change the above conclusion , and the number of ionizing photons required per atom would be of order unity .",
    "based on three - dimensional simulations , gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) argued that the clumpiness of the gas increases the average global recombination rate by a factor @xmath19 ( the averages are taken over the simulation box ) .",
    "this would imply a corresponding increase in the necessary number of ionizing photons per atom .",
    "however , in a more detailed picture of reionization in an inhomogeneous universe ( gnedin 1998 , miralda - escud et al .",
    "1999 ) , the high - density regions are ionized at a significantly later time than the low density regions .",
    "if this picture is correct , then one ionizing photon per atom would suffice to reionize most of the volume ( filled by the low - density gas ) ; recombinations from the high - density regions would only contribute to the average recombination rate at a later redshift .",
    "the reionization redshift can be estimated from first principles . in the simplest picture [ first discussed by arons & wingert ( 1972 ) in the context of quasars ] ,",
    "a homogeneous neutral igm is percolated by the individual hii regions growing around each isolated uv source .",
    "the universe is reionized when the ionized bubbles overlap , i.e. when the filling factor of hii regions reaches unity .",
    "several authors studied this problem ( carr et al .",
    "1984 , couchman & rees 1986 , fukugita & kawasaki 1994 , meiksin & madau 1993 ; shapiro et al .",
    "1994 , tegmark et al . 1994 ; aghanim et al . 1996",
    "; haiman & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "specifically , haiman & loeb ( 1998a ) have used the press ",
    "schechter formalism to describe the formation of halos that potentially host ionizing sources , in order to estimate the redshift at which overlap occurs . in this study ,",
    "star and quasar black hole formation was allowed only inside halos that can cool efficiently via atomic hydrogen , since molecular hydrogen would be photodissociated earlier , as argued by haiman , abel & rees ( 1999 ) and haiman , rees & loeb ( 1997 ) .",
    "this requirement translates to a minimum virial temperature of @xmath20k , or halo masses above @xmath21^{-3/2}$ ] ( see fig .  [ fig : bubbles ] ) . for both types of sources ,",
    "the total amount of light they produce was calibrated using data from redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "the efficiency of early star formation can be estimated from the observed metallicity of the intergalactic medium ( songaila & cowie 1996 , tytler  et  al .",
    "1995 ) , utilizing the fact that these metals and the reionizing photons likely originate from the same stellar population .",
    "similarly , the efficiency of black hole formation inside early mini ",
    "quasars can be constrained to match the subsequent evolution of the quasar luminosity function at redshifts @xmath22 ( pei 1995 ) .",
    "these assumptions generically lead to a reionization redshift @xmath23 .",
    "the uncertainty in the redshift reflects a range of cosmological parameters ( @xmath24 ) , cdm power spectra ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , and efficiency parameters for the production and escape fraction of ionizing photons . in the stellar reionization scenario ,",
    "the predicted redshift could be above or below this range , if the initial mass function was strongly biased ( relative to scalo 1986 ) towards massive or low - mass stars .",
    "although the naive picture of overlapping hii spheres may give a good estimate for the `` overlap redshift '' , it is likely to be a crude and incomplete description of the real process of reionization .",
    "the ionizing sources are expected to be located in the highly overdense regions that form the complex large scale structure of the universe - along filaments or sheets , or at their intersections ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] ) .",
    "the ionizing radiation will have to cross the local dense structures before propagating into the igm , which itself has significant density fluctuations .",
    "several important consequences of these inhomogeneities can be noted .",
    "first , reionization could occur `` outside - in ''",
    "( miralda - escud et al .",
    "1999 ) , if the radiation from a typical source escapes through a relatively narrow solid angle from its host , without causing significant local ionization . in this case",
    ", the low  density regions could be ionized significantly earlier than the high  density regions . an important effect in this case",
    "could be the shadowing of ionizing radiation by the dense concentrations within the igm .",
    "the same type of shadowing effect was found to be important at low redshift .",
    "based on the number of ly@xmath6 absorbers , madau , haardt & rees ( 1998 ) have concluded that as much as @xmath27% of the uv flux is absorbed by these systems .",
    "the redshift at which the igm becomes optically thin to the ionizing continuum is therefore significantly delayed relative to the overlap epoch , when the ionized zones first percolate .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the ionizing sources are densely spaced along filaments , and their radiation ionizes most of the dense filament before escaping into the igm . in this `` inside - out '' case , the description of ionized zones surrounding their host source would be more applicable .",
    "an important feedback during and after reionization is that the newly established uv background can photo  evaporate the gas from small ( @xmath28 ) halos ( shapiro , raga & mellema 1997 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ) . a related point , important for the detection of the gp trough , is that at the time of overlap of the hii zones , each individual hii region could still have a non ",
    "negligible ly@xmath6 optical depth , due to its residual hi fraction .",
    "the gp trough therefore disappears only from the spectra of individual sources located below the later redshift when the average ly@xmath6 optical depth of the igm drops below unity ( haiman & loeb 1998b ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "1999 ; shapiro et al .",
    "finally , the inhomogeneity of the reionized igm leads to generation of anisotropies in the cmb which are strongly suppressed in the homogeneous case , as we shall see below .",
    "reionization is now also being addressed by three - dimensional simulations , which can eventually shed light on some of the above issues .",
    "the first such studies approximated radiative transfer by assuming an isotropic radiation field , but were able to take into account the inhomogeneities in the gas distribution ( ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "the resulting reionization redshift of @xmath29 in a @xmath30cdm model is in good agreement with the semi ",
    "analytical estimates , given the differences in the assumed cosmology , power spectra , and star formation efficiency .",
    "however , an isotropic radiation field is necessarily a crude approximation , at least in the beginning stages of reionization , when each source still has its own isolated ionized zone . in order to understand the progressive overlap of ionized zones , including effects such as self - shielding and shadowing by dense clumps , it is necessary to incorporate radiative transfer into three dimensional simulations ( norman et al .",
    "1998 ) . the numerical algorithms for the first such attempts",
    "are described in abel , norman & madau ( 1998 ) and razoumov & scott ( 1998 ) .",
    "results from an approximate treatment ( gnedin 1998 ) also support the outside  in picture of reionization described above .",
    "several authors have emphasized that the known population of quasars or galaxies provide @xmath3110 times fewer ionizing photons than necessary to reionize the universe ( see , e.g. shapiro et al .",
    "1994 , or madau et al . 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the two most natural candidates for undetected ionizing sources are the mini  galaxies and mini  quasars expected to be associated with small ( @xmath32 ) dark halos at @xmath33 . as there are no compelling _ ab initio _ theoretical arguments to strongly favor one type of source over the other ,",
    "the best hope is to distinguish these two possibilities from observations .",
    "one expects at least three major differences between mini  galaxies and mini  quasars : their spectra , their absolute brightness ( or , alternatively , space density ) , and the angular size of their luminous regions .",
    "the flux from stellar populations drops rapidly with frequency above the ionization threshold of hydrogen , while the spectra of mini  quasars are expected to be harder and extend into the x  ray regime .",
    "stars could therefore not reionize heii , while quasars with typical spectra ( elvis et al . 1994 ) would reionize heii at approximately the same redshift as h ( haiman & loeb 1998a ) .",
    "however , recent high - resolution spectra of @xmath34 quasars have shown a widely fluctuating heii / hi optical depth ( reimers et al .",
    "the authors interpreted this observation as evidence for heiii regions embedded in an otherwise heii medium , i.e. a detection of the heii reionization epoch ( see also wadsley et al .",
    "if this interpretation is verified by future data , it would constrain the number of mini ",
    "quasars with hard spectra extending to x  rays at high redshifts ( haiman & loeb 1998b ; miralda - escud 1998 ; miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) . at present , a plausible alternative interpretation of the heii observations is that the observed heii optical depth fluctuations are caused by statistical fluctuations in the igm density or the ionizing background flux ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "1999 ) , rather than by the patchy structure of heii / heiii zones .    the x  ray background ( xrb ; miyaji et al . 1998",
    "; fabian & barcons 1992 ) might provide another useful constraint on mini ",
    "quasar models with hard spectra ( haiman & loeb 1998c ) .",
    "these models overpredict the _ unresolved flux _ by a factor of @xmath35 in the 0.11 kev range . if an even larger fraction of the xrb will be resolved into low ",
    "redshift agns in the future , then the xrb could be used to place more stringent constraints on the x - ray spectrum or the abundance of the mini",
    " quasars .",
    "a second distinction between galaxies and quasars can be made based on their absolute luminosity and space density .",
    "on average , based on their @xmath36 counterparts , high  redshift mini ",
    "quasars are expected to be roughly @xmath37 times brighter , but @xmath38 times more rare , than galaxies . at the overlap epoch , hii regions from mini  quasars would therefore be larger but fewer than those from mini  galaxies .",
    "the typical size and abundance of hii regions has at least three important implications .",
    "first , it affects the cmb anisotropies ; the larger the hii regions , the larger the effect on the cmb ( gruzinov and hu 1998 , knox et al .",
    "1998 ) , as we will see below .",
    "second , large enough hii regions ( @xmath39mpc ) would allow gaps to open up in the gp trough ; the flux transmitted through such gaps around very bright quasars could be detectable ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "third , if sources form inside the rare , high-@xmath40 peaks , they would be strongly clustered ( knox et al .",
    "this clustering would increase the effective luminosity of each source , and would enhance both of the effects above .    finally , a constraint on the number of mini  quasars at @xmath41 can be derived from the hubble deep field ( hdf ) .",
    "quasars are expected to appear as faint point ",
    "sources in the hdf , unless their underlying extended host galaxies are resolved .",
    "the properties of faint _ extended _ sources found in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) agree with detailed semi ",
    "analytic models of galaxy formation ( baugh et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hdf has revealed only a handful of faint _ unresolved _ sources , and none with the colors expected for high redshift quasars ( conti et al .",
    "1999 ) . the simplest mini ",
    "quasar models predict the existence of @xmath42 b  band `` dropouts '' in the hdf , inconsistent with the lack of detection of such dropouts up to the @xmath43 completeness limit at @xmath44 . to reconcile the models with the data",
    ", a mechanism is needed that suppresses the formation of quasars in halos with circular velocities @xmath45 ( haiman , madau & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "this suppression naturally arises due to the photo - ionization heating of the intergalactic gas by the uv background after reionization .",
    "forthcoming data on point  sources from nicmos observations of the hdf ( see thompson et al .",
    "1998 ) could further improve these constraints .",
    "as described above , theoretical expectations place the reionization redshift at @xmath46 .",
    "what about observations ?",
    "at present , the best _ lower _ limit in the reionization redshift comes from the detection of high ",
    "redshift ly@xmath6 emitters ( hu et al . 1998 ; weymann et al .",
    "1998 ) . as argued by miralda - escud ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the damping wing of ly@xmath6 absorption by a neutral igm has a large residual optical depth that would severely damp any ly@xmath6 emission line .",
    "currently the highest redshift at which a ly@xmath6 emitter is seen is @xmath47 ; the existence of this object implies that reionization occurred prior to this redshift ( see haiman & spaans 1998 ) . note that hii regions around individual sources , excepting only the brightest quasars , would be too small to allow the escape of ly@xmath6 photons , because the damping wings of the gp troughs around the hii region would still overlap .",
    "the best _ upper _ limit on the reionization redshift can be obtained from the cmb anisotropy data .",
    "several experiments have revealed a rise in the power on small angular scales , and a drop at even smaller scales ( e.g. , bond  1999 ) , showing evidence for the first doppler peak expected from acoustic oscillations in the baryon - photon fluid prior to recombination ( e.g. , hu & sugiyama 1994 ) .",
    "these observations can also be used to set limits on the electron scattering optical depth ( or the corresponding reionization redshift ) that would suppress the doppler peak . from a compilation of all the existing measurements , griffiths et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have derived the stringent ( although model - dependent ) constraint @xmath48 on the reionization redshift  if reionization occurred earlier , the electron scattering optical depth would have reduced the amplitude of the anisotropies below the observed level .",
    "note that another upper limit results from the spectral distortion of the cmb caused by scattering on the reionized igm , which is constrained by the upper limit on the compton @xmath49parameter measured by cobe .",
    "the inferred upper limit on the reionization redshift , however , is much weaker , @xmath50 for typical parameters in a low  density universe ( griffiths et al .",
    "1998 , see also stebbins & silk 1986 ) . in summary ,",
    "present observations have narrowed down the possible redshift of the reionization epoch to @xmath51 , a relatively narrow range that is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions described above .",
    "further observational progress in probing the reionization epoch could come either from the _ next generation space telescope _",
    "( _ ngst _ ) , or from more precise measurements of the cmb anisotropies by _ map _ and _ planck_. _ ngst _ , scheduled for launch in 2007 , is expected to reach the @xmath52njy sensitivity required to detect individual sources to @xmath33 , and to perform medium ",
    "resolution spectroscopy to @xmath53 .",
    "if reionization occurred close to the low end of the allowed redshift range , @xmath54 , then it may be possible to infer the redshift directly from the spectra of bright sources .",
    "one specific method relies on the spectrum of a bright source just beyond the reionization redshift , so that the individual ly@xmath6 , ly@xmath55 , and other gp troughs do not overlap in frequency , leaving gaps of transmitted flux ( haiman & loeb 1998b ) . the measurement of this transmitted flux would be possible with _ ngst _ , despite absorption by the high ",
    "redshift ly@xmath6 forest , as long as the number density of absorbers does not rise much more steeply with redshift than an extrapolation of the current @xmath36 data would imply ( fardal et al .",
    "if reionization is gradual , rather than abrupt , than this method would measure the redshift at which the gp optical depth drops to near unity , i.e. the final stages of the reionization epoch . an alternative signature to look for would be the precise shape of the damping wing of ly@xmath6 absorption from the neutral igm along the line of sight to the source ( miralda - escud 1998 ) .",
    "the shape , if measured by high  resolution spectroscopy , could be used to determine the total optical depth of the igm .",
    "the caveat of this method is the inability to distinguish the neutral igm from a damped ly@xmath6 absorber along the line of sight , close to the source .",
    "an alternative signature is the background ly@xmath6 emission from the reionization epoch .",
    "recombinations are slow both at high redshifts , when the igm is still neutral , and at low redshifts when the igm density is low . as shown by simulations ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) , the global recombination rate has a pronounced peak around the reionization epoch .",
    "the resulting recombinant ly@xmath6 emission has been computed by baltz , gnedin & silk ( 1998 ) , and a detailed detectability study has shown that this signal could be measured by _ ngst _ , or perhaps even by _ hst _",
    "( shaver et al . 1999 ) .",
    "yet another signature could result from the 21 cm hyperfine transitions in the igm before reionization .",
    "prior to reionization , the excitation of the 21 cm line in neutral hi atoms depends on the spin temperature .",
    "the coupling of the spin temperature to that of the cmb is determined by the local gas density , temperature , and the radiation background from the first mini  galaxies and mini  quasars .",
    "in general , the 21 cm line could be seen either in absorption or emission against the cmb , and could serve as a tomographic tool to diagnose the density and temperature of the high redshift neutral gas ( see , e.g. madau et al .",
    "1997 ; scott & rees 1990 ) . if reionization occurred at @xmath56 , the redshifted 21 cm signals would be detectable by the giant metrewave radio telescope ; a study of the effect at higher redshifts would be possible with next generation instruments such as the thousand element array , or the square kilometer array ( shaver et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the reionization redshift could turn out to be closer to the high end of the allowed range , @xmath57 , rendering direct detection of emission from the reionization epoch implausible ( except perhaps the 21 cm signal ) .",
    "there is , however , a fortunate `` complementarity '' , since the electron scattering optical depth increases with reionization redshift . due to the effect on the polarization power spectrum on large angular scales , _ map _ and _ planck _",
    "may be able to discern an electron scattering optical depth as small as a few percent ( zaldarriaga et al .",
    "1997 , eisenstein et al .",
    "1998 , prunet et al .",
    "1998 ) . by temperature anisotropy data",
    "alone , they may be able to determine an optical depth as small as @xmath58 due to the damping effect mentioned earlier  and to be discussed in more detail later .",
    "the reionizing sources may also change the spectral shape of the cmb .",
    "the dust that is inevitably produced by the first type ii supernovae , absorbs the uv emission from early stars and mini  quasars and re - emits this energy at longer wavelengths .",
    "loeb & haiman ( 1997 ) have quantified the resulting spectral distortion in press ",
    "schechter type models , assuming that each type ii supernova in a scalo imf yields @xmath59 of dust with the wavelength - dependent opacity of galactic dust , uniformly distributed throughout the intergalactic medium . under these assumptions ,",
    "the dust remains cold ( close to the cmb temperature ) , and its emission peaks near the cmb peak .",
    "the resulting spectral distortion can be expressed as a compton @xmath49parameter @xmath60 , near the upper limit derived from measurement of the cmb spectrum by cobe ( fixsen et al . 1996 ) . a substantial fraction ( @xmath61@xmath62% ) of this total @xmath49parameter results simply from the direct far - infrared emission by early mini ",
    "quasars and could be present even in the absence of any intergalactic dust .",
    "inhomogeneities in the dust distribution could change these conclusions .",
    "instead of being homogeneously mixed into the igm , the high  redshift dust may remain concentrated inside or around the galaxies where it is produced . in this case , the average dust particle would see a higher flux than assumed in loeb & haiman ( 1997 ) , so that the dust temperature would be higher , and dust emission would peak at a shorter wavelength",
    ". the magnitude of the spectral distortion would be enhanced , and may account for the recently discovered cosmic infrared background ( puget et al .",
    "1996 , schlegel et al .",
    "1998 , fixsen et al .",
    "1998 , hauser et al . 1998 ) as shown by the semi  analytic models of baugh et al .",
    "an angular fluctuation in the magnitude of the distortion would also be expected in this case , reflecting the discrete nature of the sources contributing to the effect .    as seen above",
    ", reionization has several consequences ; in the rest of this review we focus on the connection to the cmb , and the effects of inhomogeneities .",
    "in this section , we give an in - depth treatment of the effects on the cmb photons of thomson - scattering off of the free electrons produced by reionization . after defining the optical depth and giving its dependence on the redshift of reionization and cosmological parameters ,",
    "we discuss the three separate effects : damping , doppler and polarization generation .",
    "then we derive the evolution equations from the boltzmann equation , argue that the doppler effect is the most important _ inhomogeneous _ effect , and calculate the resulting power spectrum for several simple models of inhomogeneous reionization ( ihr ) .    the probability of a photon scattering in the time interval from some initial time @xmath63 to the present ,",

    "thus we see that the fraction of cmb photons that have been scattered may be very small , but that this fraction grows fairly rapidly with increasing redshift .",
    "the increase in optical depth for fixed @xmath67 with increasing @xmath85 is due to the fact that the proper time from the present to @xmath67 increases as the cosmological constant increases .",
    "here we give simple arguments about the nature of the damping , doppler and polarization effects . before doing so",

    "since the photons that have been scattered in come from many different lines of sight , their average temperature is very nearly the global average  an assumption made in equation  [ eqn : simpledamping ] .",
    "the net result is that @xmath94 and therefore @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "this simple calculation would imply that the damping is independent of scale , which is not exactly true .",
    "our assumption that the average @xmath97 along lines of sight that scattered in equals the global average holds only when the distance _ between _ the scattering surfaces is much larger than the length scale of interest . at very large angular scales ,",
    "the damping does not occur , as one would expect from simple causality considerations .",
    "more precisely , the damping factor is @xmath98-dependent and , defined via @xmath99 , is given by the fitting formula of hu & white 1997 : r_l^2 = 1-(-2 ) a+c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4 x^4 + ( -2 ) , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 . the characteristic angular scale @xmath103 is roughly the angular scale subtended by the horizon at the new last - scattering surface and is given approximately by ( griffiths et al .",
    "1998 , hu & white 1997 ) : l_r = ( 1+z_ion)^1/2(1 + 0.84_0)-1 . if not for the @xmath98-dependence , the damping effect would be completely degenerate with the amplitude of the primary power spectrum ; i.e. , their effects would be indistinguishable .",
    "the similar response to amplitude and @xmath104 over a large range of @xmath98 makes them approximately degenerate and is the reason why the optical depth can only be determined to about 10% ( zaldarriaga et al .",
    "1997 ) or possibly worse ( eisenstein et al . 1998 ) based on temperature anisotropy alone .",
    "the thomson scattering _ differential _ cross - section is polarization - dependent , and therefore the scattered radiation may be polarized even if the incident radiation is not .",
    "however , by symmetry considerations alone one can see that initially isotropic radiation will not become polarized .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that the particular anisotropy required for the creation of polarization is a quadrupole moment .",

    "determining the location of this peak allows one to determine the epoch of reionization .",
    "the amplitude of the peak is proportional to the optical depth , and thus also helps in determining @xmath67 .",
    "unfortunately , the signal is very weak and present only at large angular scales , e.g. , @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "since there are only @xmath118 independent modes from which to determine @xmath89 , sample variance is worst at low @xmath98 . also , the large - scale features of polarization maps reconstructed from time - ordered data are likely to be those most sensitive to systematic errors . finally , polarized galactic foregrounds ( dust and synchrotron ) are expected to be most troublesome at small @xmath98 ( bouchet et al .",
    "1998 , knox 1998 ) .",
    "however , a benefit of the low-@xmath109 location of this signature is that if it can be measured , its interpretation will not be complicated by the inhomogeneity of the reionization , which is a much smaller - scale phenomenon .",

    "( 1998 ) can be employed for an approximate treatment .",
    "the cancellations at small scales can be greatly reduced by the modulation of the number density of free electrons which we can write as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the ionization fraction and @xmath131 is the number density of all protons , including those in h and he .",
    "this modulation occurs even in the case of homogeneous reionization ( spatially constant @xmath130 ) due to spatial variations in @xmath131 .",

    "that this second order effect could dominate the first - order one ( which is small due to cancellations ) was pointed out by ostriker and vishniac and is known as the ostriker - vishniac effect ( ostriker & vishniac 1986 , vishniac 1987 ) .",

    "another source of modulation of the number density of free electrons is spatial variations in @xmath130 , i.e. , ihr .",
    "as a photon streams towards us from the last - scattering surface , it may pick up a doppler `` up kick '' on one side of an overdensity , but avoid the canceling `` down kick '' on the other because the igm there is still neutral .",
    "how effectively the cancellation is avoided depends on the matching between the typical sizes of the ionized domains and the correlation length of the velocity field , as we will discuss below .",
    "we now derive equation  [ eqn : doppler ] , as well as a more general expression which includes the contribution from damping as well .",
    "more complete treatments of the evolution of a photon distribution function in an expanding , inhomogeneous universe can be found in , e.g. , ma & bertschinger ( 1995 ) .",
    "the boltzmann equation governing the evolution of the photon phase - space distribution function , @xmath133 , is simply @xmath134 , where @xmath135 takes into account the effect of collisions  in this case with electrons via thomson scattering .",

    "it can be taken to higher order , if desired , by getting @xmath155 from @xmath156 , etc .",
    "note that for the doppler effect equation  [ eqn : delta ] is exact because @xmath132 ( unlike , e.g. , @xmath157 ) receives no corrections due to the optical depth .",
    "we can now argue that the doppler effect , due to the @xmath125 term in equation  [ eqn : delta ] , is the most important inhomogeneous effect .",
    "the dominance of this effect is due to the fact that by the time of reionization , velocities have grown substantially as they react to the gravitational field . on the relevant length scales , the rms peculiar velocities are about @xmath158 .",
    "in contrast , the damping of the anisotropy is due to the @xmath159 term in @xmath147 , which has not grown from its primordial value of @xmath160 .",
    "similarly , polarization is sourced by the quadrupole moment which is also still at the @xmath160 level at the epoch of reionization .",

    "( 1998 ) it is this latter 2-point function which must be calculated from either simulations or analytical models of the reionization process .",

    "1998 ) , or ( 3 ) the black hole masses grow in an optically inactive phase ( e.g. haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ) .",

    "a detection of an ihr signal in the cmb with a peak could have important implications for quasar evolution theories , e.g. by ruling out models that lead to short duty cycles and small patch sizes .",

    "the above calculations of the ihr power spectrum all assumed that the ionized regions are uncorrelated .",
    "however , the pattern of density fluctuations will affect the pattern of ionized regions and therefore correlations in the density field should give rise to correlations in the ionization fraction field .",
    "determining what these correlations should be is complicated by the fact that the density field affects the ionization field in two different ways : by the fact that the sources are most likely located in high density regions and the fact that the recombination rates are highest in the densest regions .",
    "to take the former effect into account , kds gave the ionization field the same correlation structure as that of the `` high - peaks '' of the density field .",
    "these high - peaks are regions where the fractional density perturbation , @xmath193 , smoothed on the appropriate scale , exceeds the critical value for spherical collapse . the smoothing scale was taken to be that corresponding to @xmath194^{-3/2}$ ] , since objects below this size will not be able to cool sufficiently to fragment and form stars ( haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "one further assumption was that the sources ionized a region @xmath195 times larger than that from which they collapsed where the efficiency factor is time - dependent and given by ( haiman & loeb 1997 , haiman & loeb 1998a ) @xmath196 .",
    "for this rather high choice for the efficiency , reionization is complete at @xmath197 .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ fig : pspec ] .",
    "the correlations between the patches  which are individually only hundreds of kiloparsecs in radius  drastically alter the low @xmath98 shape .",

    "planck_.    work by oh ( 1999 ) supports the idea that the ionized patches should be correlated .",
    "oh has modeled the ionizing sources as characterized by a mean separation ( given by press - schechter theory ) , an isotropic attenuation length which specifies how far the ionizing radiation propagates , and a power - law correlation function ( appropriate for these highly - biased objects ) .",
    "placing sources in a box and working out the resulting flux densities he can then calculate the correlation function of the flux density .",
    "it is indeed correlated , with significant ( 0.2 ) correlation at a comoving separations of 10 mpc .",
    "although a clumping factor for the igm from gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) is used to estimate the attenuation length , all propagation from the sources is taken to be isotropic , and hence this work does not yet include the influence of shielding and shadowing .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : pspec ] , the contribution from ihr may be sub - dominant to that from the ostriker - vishniac ( o - v ) effect , as it is for all three models of ihr shown .",

    "however , the amplitude is not very sensitive to @xmath104 because much of the effect actually comes from more recent times  the dropping number density of electrons must compete with the growth in the density contrasts and peculiar velocities(hu & white 1995 , jk98 ) .",
    "of course , the separation into ihr and o - v is artificial , and efforts to understand the contribution from reionization are surely going to benefit from treating them simultaneously .",

    "the principal unanswered questions about reionization are : what type of sources caused it , and at what redshift did it occur ?",
    "these questions have been addressed both theoretically and observationally . from a theoretical point of view , the two leading candidate sources are an early generation of stars ( `` mini  galaxies '' ) , or massive black holes in small halos ( `` mini  quasars '' ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate the efficiencies with which objects form in the earliest collapsed halos : from the metals in the ly@xmath6 forest , and from the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "however , the uncertainties in these efficiencies are still too large to allow definite predictions .",
    "the expected reionization redshift , depending on the type of source , cosmology , power spectrum , and a combination of the efficiency factors , is between @xmath204 in homogeneous models .",
    "a further complication is the inhomogeneous nature of reionization : the sources of ionizing radiation are likely clustered , and embedded in complex dense regions , such as the filaments and sheets seen in 3d simulations . at the same time , the gas to be ionized likely has significant density fluctuations .",
    "further theoretical progress on the problem will likely come from 3d simulations .",
    "such simulations must be able to follow the propagation of a non - spherical ionization front into a medium that has large density fluctuations , as well as opaque clumps of absorbing material . in a homogeneous medium populated by randomly distributed sources ,",
    "the background radiation would have negligible fluctuations ( e.g. zuo 1992 ) . however , because the density inhomogeneities absorb the uv flux of the ionizing sources , and re - emit diffuse ionizing photons as they recombine , the ionizing background will likely become significantly inhomogeneous and anisotropic ( norman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the first numerical algorithms to deal in full detail with these problems have been proposed by abel , norman & madau ( 1998 ) and razoumov & scott ( 1998 ) ( see also gnedin 1998 ) .",
    "the reionization redshift can also be constrained observationally , with a resulting uncertainty that is comparable to the theoretical range : @xmath205 . on both ends of this redshift range ,",
    "observational progress is likely in the near feature .",
    "if new ly@xmath6 emitters are discovered at higher redshifts , this would improve the lower bound .",
    "conversely , as the cmb data are collected , the constraint on the electron scattering optical depth will improve , tightening the upper bound .",
    "we have seen how the optical depth to thomson - scattering , and hence the epoch of reionization , can be constrained by determining the amount of damping in the cmb temperature anisotropy and by detection of the polarization contribution at very large angular scales .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity of the reionization process gives us a further opportunity to probe in more detail the epoch of reionization .",
    "for this probe to become reality , further development of theoretical predictions is required , as well as more sensitive measurements at arc minute and smaller angular scales .    fortunately , the inhomogeneity of reionization is unlikely to spoil our ability to interpret the primary cmb anisotropy , to be measured with exquisite precision over the next decade , although this may not be the case if reionization did indeed occur via mini  quasars . for the mini ",
    "galaxy models , even when reionization occurs at the very high end of the allowed redshift range , very little signal is produced at the relevant angular scales .",
    "further progress in these predictions is likely to be motivated by the desire to understand the spectrum at @xmath206 as a means of probing the end of the dark ages , rather than at @xmath207 , as a possible contaminant of the primary signal .",
