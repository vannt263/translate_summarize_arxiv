    "though well - studied for over fifty years , the spectral theory of hyperbolic surfaces still presents basic unresolved questions @xcite .",
    "for example , does there exist a noncompact , finite area hyperbolic surface whose laplacian has no nonconstant square - integrable eigenfunctions ?",
    "this question has been the subject of many investigations including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the triangle @xmath0 defined by @xmath1 and @xmath2 . ]    as a model problem , phillips and sarnak @xcite suggested studying the neumann eigenvalue problem on the domain @xmath3 pictured in figure [ trisect ] . in this paper , we prove the following :    [ thm : main ] for all but at most countably many @xmath40,1[$ ] , the neumann laplacian on the geodesic triangle @xmath0 in the hyperbolic plane has no nonconstant ( square - integrable ) eigenfunction .",
    "the group @xmath5 of hyperbolic isometries generated by reflections in the geodesic arcs that bound @xmath0 is discrete if and only if @xmath6 for @xmath7 an integer .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 , then @xmath5 contains an index two subgroup that is naturally isomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "it follows from the seminal work of a. selberg @xcite that if @xmath10 or @xmath11 , then the neumann laplacian has infinitely many nonconstant eigenfunctions . in particular , for some special @xmath12 , there do exist square - integrable solutions to the neumann problem .",
    "is an integer not equal to @xmath13 , or @xmath11 , phillips and sarnak asked whether the domain @xmath14 has no nonconstant neumann eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "we should point out that since theorem [ thm : main ] allows for countably many exceptional @xmath12 , it does not directly answer their question . ]    in @xcite , theorem [ thm : main ] was verified under an additional  and as of yet unjustified  assumption concerning the spectral multiplicities of the neumann laplacian acting on @xmath15 .",
    "the proof consisted of studying the singular perturbation problem associated with letting @xmath12 tend to @xmath16 .",
    "similar singular perturbations were studied in the context of degenerating hyperbolic surfaces @xcite and unitary characters over a fixed hyperbolic surface @xcite . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and all prior work on this problem , it was necessary to make assumptions about the multiplicities of the spectrum of the limiting surface .",
    "the angles of a geodesic triangle in the hyperbolic plane determine the isometry class of the triangle .",

    "is much more involved .",
    "in particular , the proof will rely upon a refined analysis of ` crossings ' of eigenvalue branches .    to prove theorem 1.1 ,",
    "we further develop the method of ` asymptotic separa- tion of variables ' that we introduced in [ hlrjdg11 ] to study generic simplicity of eigenvalues .",
    "this method facilitates the study of real - analytic eigenvalue branches in situations where a geometric domain degenerates onto a lower dimensional domain .",
    "there is a vast literature  for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  concerning perturbations involving degeneration onto lower dimensional domains , but most of these studies do not address analytic eigenvalue branches .",
    "in contrast , our results depend crucially on a study of real - analytic eigenbranches and their crossings .",
    "we now describe the content of each section .    in  [ section : prelim ] , we establish notation and recall basic features of the spectral theory of the laplacian acting on functions on a domain in the hyperbolic plane having one cusp .",
    "we describe the fourier decomposition associated to the cusp . the zeroth fourier mode is responsible for an essential spectrum of @xmath21 .",

    "we will call such an eigenfunction a _",
    "cusp form_. , these are ` cusp forms ' in the sense of the theory of automorphic forms , but otherwise there is no discrete group , and hence they are not cusp forms in the traditional sense . in this paper",
    "we will always be considering ` even ' cusp forms , that is , eigenfunctions satisfying neumann conditions .",
    "] the operator associated to @xmath23 has compact resolvent and hence discrete spectrum .",
    "this makes @xmath23 a much better candidate for the application of methods from spectral perturbation theory .    in  [ sec :",
    "generic ] , we recall and make precise some ideas familiar in the perturbational study of cusp form existence .",
    "we consider a real - analytic family , @xmath27 , of quadratic forms that have the same domain as @xmath23 .",
    "we say that a real - analytic family @xmath28 of eigenfunctions of @xmath29 is a _ cusp form eigenbranch _ if and only @xmath30 is a cusp form for each @xmath12 .",
    "we demonstrate a dichotomy : either the family @xmath27 has a real - analytic cusp form eigenbranch or the set of @xmath12 such that @xmath29 has a cusp form is countable .    in  [ section : alltriangles ] , we consider arbitrary real - analytic paths in the space of hyperbolic triangles with one cusp .",
    "we apply the results of  [ sec : generic ] to deduce theorem [ thm : gennocf ] under the assumtption that there exists a triangle with no nonconstant neumann eigenfunction .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to proving theorem [ thm : main ] which will give the existence of such a triangle .",

    "we prove theorem [ thm : main ] . by the dichotomy of  [ sec : generic ] , it suffices to show that real - analytic cusp form eigenbranches do not exist .",

    ", we will contradict ( [ trackingestimate ] ) .",
    "the key observation is the following : since @xmath41 limits to @xmath58 , it has to ` cross ' each of the eigenbranches of @xmath35 that limit to zero .",
    "we show that near such a crossing , the branch @xmath30 must ` interact ' with the functions in @xmath59 to such an extent that the projection onto @xmath43 can not be too large .",

    "<S> we show that the generic such triangle has no eigenvalues embedded in its continuous spectrum . to prove this result we study the behavior of the real - analytic eigenvalue branches of a degenerating family of triangles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we use a careful analysis of spectral projections near the crossings of these eigenvalue branches with the eigenvalue branches of a model operator . </S>"
