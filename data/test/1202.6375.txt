    "the skyrme model is a nonlinear field theory having localized solutions , the so - called skyrmions , that are of finite energy and are characterized by a topological charge .",
    "it is an effective theory of low - energy qcd in the limit of a large number of colours , thus it describes baryons in a weakly coupled phase as was initially argued by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the semiclassical quantization of the model has proven to be successful in describing the phenomenological properties of the baryons in the low - energy region .",
    "the su(2 ) skyrme model was originally defined to describe a unitary field @xmath5 in a fundamental representation of the su(2 ) group with a natural boundary condition @xmath6 at the spatial infinity , @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the unitary field represents a topological map @xmath8 with an integer - valued winding number classifying the solitonic sectors of the model .",
    "this topological charge was interpreted as the baryon number .",
    "the model has been directly generalized to the case of the su(3 ) group and subsequently to the general case of the su(n ) groups @xcite .",
    "both su(2 ) and su(3 ) versions of the model have been canonically quantized using the collective coordinate formalism in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the procedure of the canonical quantization leads to the appearance of new terms in the explicit form of the lagrangian of the model that are interpreted as the quantum corrections to the mass of the skyrmion ( ` quantum mass corrections ' ) .",
    "these quantum corrections restore the stability of the solitons that is lost in the semiclassical approach .",
    "the instability in the semiclassically treated su(2 ) model was shown in @xcite .",
    "the method of the canonical quantization has been subsequently generalized in @xcite to the cases when the field @xmath9 belongs to a general representation of the su(2 ) and su(3 ) groups and the stability of the solitons was explicitly shown .",
    "interestingly , it appeared that the aforementioned quantum corrections are representation - dependent .",
    "the semiclassical quantization of the su(3 ) skyrme model has several shortcomings .",
    "for example it leads to a spectrum of masses of the baryon octet and decuplet and some physical characteristics of these that are not in a close agreement with the values observed experimentally .",
    "one of the reasons for this disagreement is that the semiclassically - treated su(3 ) model does not possess stable ( semiclassical ) solitons .",
    "henceforth the classical solution of the su(2 ) model ( classical profile function ) or some modification of it is used instead ( see e.g.  the overview @xcite ) . an alternative way to overcome these problems",
    "is to consider the bound - state approach to the skyrme model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that the quantum mass corrections of the skyrmion that appear in the canonically quantized model are essential in ensuring the stability of the quantum solitons of the su(3 ) model and realize skyrme s original conjecture that ` the mass ( of the meson ) may arise as a self - consistent quantal effect .",
    "this point will not be followed here , but when , for calculation purposes , we want to allow phenomenologically for a finite mass this will be done by adding to @xmath10 a term ( proportional to @xmath11 ) ' @xcite .",
    "we find the stable quantum solitons by varying the complete quantum energy functional with the su(3 ) octet or decuplet quantum numbers and then solving it numerically .",
    "the stability is ensured by iterative calculations .",
    "even though the su(3 ) symmetry is not an exact flavour symmetry , by properly choosing the parameters of the model we obtain a baryon mass spectrum that is very close to the experimental one .",
    "we also focus on the influence of the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) , symmetry breaking ( sb ) and the quantum mass correction terms to the baryon masses and stability of the solitons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief description of the su(3 ) model is given in the section 2 below . in section 3",
    "we construct the quantum skyrme model _",
    "ab initio _ using the collective coordinate formalism . in section 4 the quantum energy functional",
    "is derived together with the asymptotic expression of its variation .",
    "section 5 contains the numerical calculations of the mass spectrum of the baryons .",
    "sections 6 accommodates the discussion and the concluding remarks .",
    "the skyrme model is defined by the chirally symmetric lagrangian density @xmath12[\\mathbf{r}^{\\mu } , \\mathbf{r}^{\\nu } ] \\right\\ } , \\label{g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the right chiral current is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "the pion decay constant @xmath14 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 are the only parameters of the model .    the main ingredient of the model is the unitary field @xmath16 that in addition to the fundamental representation @xmath17 may also be defined for a general irreducible representation ( irrep ) @xmath18 of the su(3 ) group .",
    "then the basis states of the irrep @xmath18 are labelled by the parameters @xmath19 that are related to the hypercharge as @xmath20 ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "in such a way the classical su(2 ) solitonic solution of the hedgehog type , that is defined by the canonical @xmath21 embedding , takes the following form , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the soliton profile function , @xmath24 are pauli matrices and @xmath25 is the unit vector .",
    "the generators @xmath26 represent the su(2 ) subset of the su(3 ) algebra generators @xmath27 .",
    "the superscript denotes that they are tensors of the adjoint representation @xmath28 and thus can be expressed in terms of the gell - mann generators ( we again refer the reader to @xcite for the details ) .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the lagrangian of the model depends on the irrep the unitary field @xmath5 was defined for .",
    "interestingly the dependence on the irrep appears as an overall factor of the lagrangian and is expressed in terms of the dimension of the chosen irrep and the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator of the su(3 ) algebra .",
    "likewise the baryon number of the model includes the same overall factor .",
    "thus the lagrangian of the model may be normalized in such way that at the classical level it is irrep  independent .",
    "however this is not the case at the quantum level .",
    "the canonical quantization of the model leads to a quantum mass correction that is representation dependent .",
    "furthermore , the wess - zumino - witten and the symmetry breaking ( mass ) terms depend essentially on the chosen irrep @xcite . in this work we shall restrict to the fundamental representation of the su(3 ) group only .",
    "nevertheless we shall be using the general formalism of @xcite , hence the generalization to the higher reps is straightforward .",
    "the hedgehog ansatz reduces the lagrangian density to the following simple form , @xmath29 = -\\mathcal{m}_{\\text{cl}}(f(r ) ) = -\\bigg\\{{\\frac{f_{\\pi } ^{2}}{2}}\\bigl(f^{^{\\prime } 2}+{\\frac{2}{r^{2}}}\\sin ^{2}\\!f\\bigr ) + { \\frac{1}{2e^{2}}}{\\frac{\\sin ^{2}\\!f}{r^{2}}}\\bigl(2f^{^{\\prime } 2}+{\\frac{\\sin ^{2}\\!f}{r^{2}}}\\bigr)\\bigg\\ } ,   \\label{g17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents the mass of the classical spherically symmetric soliton .",
    "variation of this expression leads to the differential equation for the profile function @xmath23 with topological boundary conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    for completeness",
    "we also give the explicit expressions of the symmetry breaking and the wzw terms .",

    "the standard form for this term is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of colours .",
    "the canonical quantization of the model is performed in terms of the collective coordinates .",
    "this approach allows the quantum unitary field to be cast in a factorisable form with the spatial and temporal dependent parts of the field being explicitly separated , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a wigner @xmath39-matrix and is defined on the seven - dimensional homogeneous space su(3)/u(1 ) , which is specified by the seven real , independent parameters @xmath40 , ` the collective coordinates ' . the ansatz may be effectively understood as the rotation of the field @xmath41 in the quantum internal space parametrized by the collective coordinates @xmath42 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ g2 ] ) is considered quantum mechanically _",
    "ab initio_. thus the collective coordinates @xmath43 and the conjugate momenta @xmath44 are required to satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath45 = -i\\delta _ { \\beta\\alpha}$ ] . on the other hand",
    ", this means that the coordinates @xmath40 and the velocities @xmath46 do not commute , rather they should satisfy the following commutation relation , @xmath47 = -i f^{\\alpha\\beta}(q ) ,   \\label{b2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a function of @xmath49 only and the explicit form of which will be determined by the consistency conditions below .    the time derivative is defined by employing the usual weyl ordering , @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents the anticommutator .",
    "the ordering of the operators is fixed by the initial form of the lagrangian ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to avoid further ordering ambiguities in the case of the time derivatives ( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "the ansatz ( [ b1 ] ) is then substituted into the lagrangian ( [ g2 ] ) and followed by integration over the spatial coordinates . in such a way we obtain the lagrangian cast in terms of the collective coordinates and velocities .",
    "then the canonical momenta may be derived by restricting to the consideration of the terms of second order in velocities ( this is because the terms of the first order in velocities vanish identically ) .",

    "the quantum ` moment of inertia ' @xmath62 of the su(3 ) model coincides with the quantum momentum @xmath63 of the su(2 ) model .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath64 is not equal to the mechanical momentum of inertia of the mass distributed by the classical spherically symmetric hedgehog field defined in ( [ g17 ] ) .",

    "next , by requiring the canonical commutation relations @xmath68 = -i\\delta _ { \\alpha \\beta } $ ] to be satisfied , the initially undetermined commutation relations are constrained to be @xmath47 = -i g^{\\alpha \\beta } ( q , f)\\ , , \\label{b2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the inverse of .",

    "their explicit form will be presented in the section below .",

    "s theorem and performing careful calculations , the wzw term takes the following form , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the baryon number .",
    "the lagrangian of the system with the inclusion of the wzw term becomes @xmath74 .",
    "the wzw term may be considered as an external potential of the system @xcite .",
    "therefore it shifts the canonical momenta @xmath75 by @xmath76 the metric tensor @xmath77 and the functions @xmath78 are not modified and the canonical commutation relations are preserved .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath74 effectively describes a system on a curved space with the metric @xmath53 defined by .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system is obtained by employing the general method of quantization on the curved space developed by sugano _",
    "this ensures the consistency of the hamiltonian with the euler - lagrange equations of the model .",
    "we start by introducing seven right transformation generators @xmath79 that satisfy standard commutation relations of the su(3 ) algebra . here",

    "the generators @xmath84 form a su(2 ) subalgebra of su(3 ) and may be interpreted as spin operators .",

    "however we treat the model quantum mechanically _ ab initio _ and the collective coordinates @xmath110 are _ not _ small perturbations .",
    "thus the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 need to be treated as generic parameters of the model .    putting all the ingredients together",
    "the energy functional of the quantum skyrmion in the operational form for the states in the irrep @xmath111 becomes @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 represents the symmetry breaking operator @xmath115 sandwiched between the states .",
    "the variation of the energy functional @xmath116 gives an integro - differential equation for the profile function @xmath23 with the topological boundary conditions @xmath117 and @xmath31 imposed on top . at large distances",

    "the profile function @xmath130 has the required asymptotic exponential behavior ( [ f7 ] ) even in the chiral limit when the symmetry breaking term is absent . in such way the canonically quantized skyrme model is self - consistent .",
    "we want to estimate the influence of the quantum mass correction @xmath132 on the stability of the quantum solitons and to compare the mass spectrum of the baryon octet and decuplet obtained using the semiclassical ( rigid ) and the quantum ( soft ) profile functions .",

    "the first three parameters are of phenomenological origin , while the last one ( @xmath15 ) is a dimensionless parameter that is usually constrained by requiring the model to fit the experimental data .",
    "let us name these parameters the _ essential _ ones as they appear in the model explicitly .",
    "we shall also consider the following four phenomenological parameters : the nucleon mass @xmath136 mev , the asymptotic nucleon mass @xmath137 mev , the mean nucleon isoscalar ( electric ) radius @xmath138 and the mass of one of the heavier baryons ( e.g.  @xmath139 or @xmath140 ) as possible input parameters for the model .",

    "in this work we have considered the stability of the topological solitons of the quantum su(3 ) skyrme model formulated in @xcite .",
    "the model was shown to possess a family of stable quantum solitons whose energy functionals reproduce the mass spectrum of the baryon octet and decuplet in a good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the semiclassical and quantum skyrme models are essentially different models and lead to distinct integro - differential equations for the profile function @xmath130 . in the semiclassical approach",
    "the energy functional @xmath192 does not receive quantum corrections and the symmetry breaking term plays an important role in obtaining the exponentially decaying asymptotic profile function . despite having correct asymptotic behavior , the semiclassical su(3 ) skyrme model does not support stable ( quantum ) solitons .",
    "recursive solutions of the variational equation @xmath116 _ do not _ converge and the classical profile function must be used instead . hence the semiclassical skyrme model is considered as describing a _ rigid _ quantum rotator because the profile function is fixed by the classical solution .",
    "the canonical quantization of the skyrme model leads to the appearance of the quantum mass corrections in its energy functional .",
    "these corrections not only ensure the correct asymptotic form of the profile function even in the absence of the symmetry breaking term , but also are necessary for obtaining stable quantum solitons with fixed baryon quantum numbers .",
    "the recursive solutions of the variational equation @xmath116 with the quantum mass corrections present _ do _ converge and lead to quantum profile functions which differ from the classical one . the difference is explicitly shown in the figure [ picture1 ]  where the classical profile function and the quantum profile functions for the baryon octet are displayed .",
    "interestingly , the stability is preserved even if the wess - zumino - witten and the symmetry breaking terms are not included in the model .",
    "thus in this sense the quantum su(3 ) skyrme model is self - consistent and may be effectively understood as describing a _ soft _ quantum rotator . despite the model being self - consistent the symmetry breaking term is necessary as it is responsible for the discrimination of the solutions with different hypercharges .",
    "thus it must be included into the model in order to obtain physically reasonable results .",
    "the quantum approach to the su(3 ) skyrme model not only makes the quantum solitons stable , but also adjusts the model to fit better to the experimental results . our numerical calculations of the mass spectrum of the octet and the decuplet of baryons presented in table  [ table1 ]  show that the quantum treatment of the model _ ab initio _ improves significantly the overlap with the experimentally - observed mass spectrum when compared with results obtained using the standard rigid rotator approach in the semiclassical version of the skyrme model .",
    "the individual quantum profile functions obtained can be used to calculate the magnetic moments and form factors of the baryons .                              c.  g.  callan , jr .",
