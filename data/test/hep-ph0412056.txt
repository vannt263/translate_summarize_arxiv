    "deep inelastic electron - proton scattering ( dis ) experiments at hera have provided measurements of the inclusive structure function @xmath2 in very small values of the bjorken variable @xmath3 . in these processes",
    "the proton target is analyzed by a hard probe with virtuality @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the four - momenta of the incoming proton and the virtual photon probe . in this domain ,",
    "the gluon is the leading parton driving the small-@xmath0 behavior of the deep inelastic observables .    a sound approach encoding all order @xmath7 resummation is the qcd dipole picture @xcite .",
    "it was proven that such approach reproduces the bfkl evolution @xcite .",
    "the main process is the onium - onium scattering , that is the reaction between two heavy quark - antiquark states ( onia ) .",
    "this process is basically perturbative due to the onium radius being the natural hard scale at which the strong coupling is computed . in the large @xmath8 limit , the heavy pair and the soft gluons",
    "are represented as a collection of color dipoles .",
    "the cross section is written as a convolution between the number of the dipoles in each onium state and the basic cross section for dipole - dipole scattering due to two - gluon exchange .",
    "the qcd dipole model can be applied to dis process , assuming that the virtual photon at high @xmath1 can be described by an onium .",
    "furthermore , the proton is described by a collection of onia with an average onium radius to be determined from phenomenology .",
    "this model has produced a successful description of the old structure function data @xcite .",
    "these achievements are our main motivation in revisiting the qcd color dipole picture and in applying it for description of the currently more accurate @xmath2 experimental results .",
    "the approach also allows a systematic framework for testing the resummed next - to - leading order bfkl evolution kernels , producing predictions for the proton structure function .",
    "a method for doing this has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the resummation schemes can tested through the mellin transformed @xmath9-moments of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that a geometric scaling for the photon - proton cross section and the symmetry between low and high @xmath1 regions are associated to the symmetry of the two - gluon dipole - dipole cross section @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within the approach , a simple analytic expression for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude has been computed taking the scattering amplitude as a solution of the bfkl equation in the vicinity of the saturation line for dipole sizes @xmath11 ( in the photon wavefuntion ) obeying @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the saturation scale .",
    "finally , the approach has recently been used to describe hard processes initiated by virtual - gluon probes @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we summarize our fit analysis using the qcd dipole phenomenology applied to dis process @xcite . in",
    "what follows , the main expressions are presented and the fitting results are shown and discussed in conclusion .",
    "the starting point in the qcd color dipole picture is the onium - onium scattering .",
    "an onium is a heavy quark - antiquark state , turning out the scattering process perturbative once the onium radius provides the hard scale entering into the strong coupling @xmath14 . as energy increases ( small-@xmath0 ) ,",
    "these original onia can radiate soft gluons due to qcd evolution . in the large @xmath8 limit ,",
    "the heavy pair and the soft gluons are represented as a collection of color dipoles .",
    "the cross section is then written as a convolution between the number of the dipoles in each onium state and the basic cross section for dipole - dipole scattering due to two - gluon exchange .",
    "the latter quantity is theoretically understood and perturbatively calculable .",
    "the physical process more suitable for using the approach is @xmath15 scattering , where the hard scale is provided by the virtualities of the virtual photons , @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the virtual photon at high @xmath1 is assumed to be described by an onium with radius @xmath17 .    on the other hand , in the dis process one",
    "has a two - scale problem where the hard scale is given by the photon virtuality and the soft one is associated to the proton typical size .",
    "hence , the proton is approximately described by a collection of onia with an unknown average onium radius .",
    "then , the dis cross section is written as a convolution of the probability of finding an onium in the proton and the photon - onium cross section .",
    "relying on renormalization group properties , a suitable ansatz for the former quantity was proposed @xcite .",
    "it depends on the average number of primary dipoles in the proton @xmath18 and on their average transverse diameter @xmath19 . under these assumptions and the convolution integral approximated by a steepest - descent method ( using the expansion of the bfkl kernel near @xmath20 )",

    "( [ sfs ] ) from the saddle - point method constrain its region of applicability .",
    "namely , the relation @xmath29 should be obeyed .",
    "this is realized for the region of moderate @xmath30 when compared to the range on @xmath31 .",
    "lets present the fitting procedure using the recent hera experimental data on the proton structure function @xcite and taking eq .",
    "( [ sfs ] ) , where @xmath32 .",
    "we defined the overall normalization for @xmath10 , @xmath33 .",
    "for the fit procedure we have considered only the small @xmath34 data , covering the range of virtualities @xmath35 gev@xmath36 .",
    "we have also fixed @xmath37 , since its value is reasonably stable for different data sets .",
    "therefore , we are left with a reduced number of parameters ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the resulting parameters for h1 and zeus experimental data sets are presented in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "the quality of fit is quite good for both h1 and zeus data sets .",
    "we have performed also an extrapolation of the fit using in all range on @xmath0 ( adding e665 the emc data ) and @xmath1 . in order to do this ,",
    "a non - singlet contribution was added and large-@xmath0 threshold factors were considered .",
    "we quote ref .",

    "the procedure presented here is similar to previous analysis on refs .",
    "@xcite , with an even lower effective power ( @xmath41 in @xcite ) .",
    "the low value for the fixed coupling constant @xmath42 reveals the well known necessity of sizeable higher order corrections to the approach .",
    "accurate analysis in this lines , considering resummed nlo bfkl kernels , has been proposed recently @xcite producing a reasonable @xmath43 for the typical @xmath1 range considered in phenomenology for structure functions .    within the approach above ,",
    "it is possible to determine longitudinal structure function @xmath44 without further adjustments . from eq .",

    "the results are in good agreement with the recent data ( see fig . ( 3 ) in @xcite ) . moreover , in the qcd dipole approach the gluon distribution function can be calculated in a straightforward way .",
    "the result is independent of the overall normalization , which contains part of the non - perturbative inputs of the model .",

    "the quantity @xmath49 $ ] comes from the integration over @xmath50 in the convolution of onia density inside the proton and photon - onium cross section .",
    "it is obtained via steepest descent method and taking the expansion of the lo bfkl kernel , @xmath51 , near @xmath52 , as referred before .",
    "we have compared expressions eq .",
    "( [ xg ] ) with nlo dglap resummed kernels .",
    "a sizeable deviation between the recent h1 and zeus fits for that parton density function and the qcd dipole result is found @xcite , whereas it is consistent with previous analysis .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the gluon distribution is an indirect observable , with its determination being model - dependent , and a direct comparison is not straightforward .",
    "we quote ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on this discussion .    as a final remark ,",
    "very recently a pioneering phenomenological analysis using resummed nlo bfkl kernels in the saddle - point approximation has been done in ref .",
    "the lo fit provided paramaters similar to ours , with a slightly higher @xmath53 .",
    "the nlo fits give a qualitatively satisfactory account of the running @xmath14 effect but quantitatively the quality of fit remains sizeably higher than the lo fit .",
    "this feature suggests the investigation of other proposed theoretical resummation schemes and/or to improve those ones considered in the first analysis presented in ref .",
