    "magnetic monopoles are particles carrying a quantized magnetic charge and are predicted in various theories . in classical electrodynamics , their existence would symmetrize maxwell s equations with respect to the sources of the electromagnetic field .",
    "quantum mechanically , the existence of magnetic monopoles implies that both electric charge and the hypothetical magnetic charge , are quantized , given that the associated electromagnetic fields still satisfy maxwell s equations @xcite . the resulting magnetic elementary charge , called the dirac charge @xmath5 , is    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the electric elementary charge and @xmath8 is the fine structure constant .    in grand unified theories ( guts )",

    "the maximum kinetic energy of a magnetic monopole due to acceleration in cosmic magnetic fields is rather uncertain but can reach @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "therefore , monopoles with masses at , or above , this energy scale should be non - relativistic . based on the propagation of magnetic monopoles in the galactic magnetic field an upper bound on the monopole flux",

    "this assumption constrains the monopole flux to be less than @xmath18 , which is called the parker bound @xcite .",
    "taking into account the fields during galaxy formation , the limit was extended by adams et al . to be less than @xmath19 for monopoles with masses below @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "many experiments have searched for relic magnetic monopoles , but there is no experimental proof for their existence .",
    "the current best limits for magnetic monopoles constrain their flux to a level of @xmath20 depending on the monopole speed and interaction mechanism @xcite .",
    "consequently , searches for magnetic monopoles require very large detectors .",

    "different analysis strategies are needed in order to cover both detection channels .",
    "this paper presents the results of a search for non - relativistic magnetic monopoles which would catalyze the proton decays via the rubakov - callan effect in icecube .",

    "it is located at the geographic south pole . for the in - ice",
    "detector @xmath0 of the antartic ice , which is used as detection medium , has been instrumented .",
    "the detector consists of 86 strings equipped with 60 digital optical modules ( doms ) each .",
    "the dom , the sensor of the icecube detector , consists of a glass pressure housing enclosing a @xmath22 diameter hamamatsu photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) with the electronics needed for signal digitization , and a set of leds for calibration purposes @xcite .",
    "signals that pass a threshold of about @xmath23 photo - electrons are digitized and recorded .",
    "this process is called a dom launch or for simplicity a _ hit _ in the following .",
    "two hits are labeled as hard local coincidences ( also called hlc pair ) , if their time difference is less than @xmath24 and the corresponding doms are nearest or next - to - nearest neighbors on the same string .",
    "the recorded data is sent to the surface and a trigger algorithm evaluates the time and position of the hits and decides whether they form an event .",
    "for example , for relativistic particles a simple multiplicity trigger requiring eight hlc hits within a time window of @xmath25 , called smt8 , is used .",
    "the doms are deployed at depths between @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite . at depths below @xmath28 ,",

    "non - relativistic magnetic monopoles would themselves be too slow to emit cherenkov light when propagating through the icecube detector .",
    "however , relativistic charged secondary particles , produced in monopole interactions with the surrounding matter , can produce cherenkov light and thus can be detected by the icecube detector .",

    "the energy loss is of the order of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "only electrons above the cherenkov threshold of @xmath33 kinetic energy emit detectable cherenkov light . however , the maximum transferred energy of a monopole with e.g. @xmath30 on an atomic electron is typically @xmath34 and no cherenkov light is produced .",
    "rubakov @xcite and callan @xcite showed that some monopoles could catalyze nucleon decays along their trajectories ( rubakov - callan effect ) .",
    "this effect depends on the gauge group of the respective gut theory @xcite and on assumptions , e.g. on the fermion masses or the relative velocity between the quarks and the monopole , used in the calculation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this process is not possible for intermediate mass monopoles with masses below @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : protondecay ] illustrates the catalyzed decay of a proton by a gut monopole into a positron and a neutral pion :    @xmath35    for this decay channel almost the full rest mass energy of the proton is transferred to electromagnetic particles . because of the high light yield this channel is used as a benchmark in the analyses .",
    "the catalysis cross section for nucleon decays @xmath36 depends not only on the cross section @xmath37 @xcite , but also on the monopole speed @xmath38 :    @xmath39    the correction @xmath40 takes into account an additional angular momentum of the monopole - nucleus - system and becomes relevant for speeds below the speed threshold @xmath41 .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath42 the catalysis cross section is enhanced or suppressed . both parameters @xmath42 and @xmath41 depend on the nucleus @xcite .",

    "a general quantity is the track length , @xmath48 , that a relativistic particle carrying a single electric charge would have to travel in order to emit the same number of cherenkov photons as the average number expected from a proton decay , @xmath49 @xcite . using this track length per proton decay , @xmath48",

    "indirect searches for monopole induced proton decays set very strong bounds on monopoles with non - relativistic speeds , e.g. the limits from super - kamiokande @xcite assuming gravitational trapping of monopoles in the sun .",
    "also a variety of bounds based on observations of neutron stars , white dwarfs and gas giants have been obtained .",
    "these bounds range from @xmath236 and depend on the catalysis cross sections as well as on details of the assumed astrophysical scenarios @xcite .",
    "although the direct icecube searches are not as stringent as indirect searches the former are not affected by astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "thus the direct icecube limits can be considered as a robust upper bound on the monopole flux , if the rubakov - callan effect is realized in nature .",
    "data taken from may 2011 until may 2012 with a dedicated slow - particle trigger and for the brightest monopoles data taken from may 2009 until may 2010 with standard - icecube - triggers were analysed .",
    "the analysis , which is based on data of the slow - particle trigger , was developed by using simulated monopole events and experimental data to estimate background properties .",
    "for this first analysis of such a signal in icecube a robust approach based on a single final selection criterion and the comparison between the number of expected background events and observed experimental events is chosen . using experimental data ,",
    "the number of expected background events can be estimated to @xmath237 .",
    "the ic-59 analysis based on standard - icecube - triggers is sensitive only for bright monopoles with @xmath238 .",
    "the analysis used boosted decision trees ( bdt ) to discriminate between monopole signal and background .",
    "the expected number of background events is derived from a fit of the bdt scores tails with an exponential function for each ( @xmath53,@xmath45 ) . the number of observed events after unblinding is @xmath239 for an expected background of @xmath240 .",
    "this event contains multiple coincident muons , which renders it compatible with a background event .",
    "the obtained flux limits for @xmath166 and @xmath241 m , @xmath242 m from the ic-59 analysis are better than the ones from the ic-86/deepcore analysis because of the bigger effective area . for @xmath155",
    "the limits are comparable since the standard icecube triggers are less sensitive to the monopole signal in comparison to the dedicated slow - particle trigger .    in both analyses",
    "no monopole signal has been observed .",
    "thus , the limits on the flux of non - relativistic magnetic monopoles  catalysing the proton decay  are improved by about more than one order of magnitude in comparison to macro @xcite for most of the investigated parameter space and reach down to about three orders of magnitude below the parker limit .",
    "since may 2012 the dedicated slow - particle trigger has been updated to the full icecube detector . from this upgrade , we expect an improvement in sensitivity by roughly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this gain is supplemented by improvements of the data selection which have been developed after completion of this analysis .",
    "examples are the implementation of a kalman - filter based hlc hit selection , which improves the angular and speed reconstruction , and the implementation of an event selection based on a boosted decision tree @xcite .",
