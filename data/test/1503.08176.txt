    "with the advent of the b factories , along with even the tevatron having sufficient luminosities to perform excellent heavy flavour studies and more recently with the data pouring in from lhcb and besiii , quark flavour physics is changing its role from being the ground for confirming the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism for @xmath6 violation , to providing the observables that can test or constrain physics beyond the standard model . with improved precision measurements",
    "the goals of hadronic weak decays will cease to be , from seeking observables free from hadronic uncertainties , to actually precisely understanding the qcd effects .",
    "along with the plethora of data on semi - leptonic , hadronic , rare decays , @xmath6 asymmetries and mixing in @xmath7 decays , discovery of charm mixing and hints of @xmath6 violation in the charm sector , resulted in non - leptonic charm meson decays being a focus of attention , in the last few years  @xcite . since @xmath6 violation in charm , direct as well as in mixing , is expected to be negligible , any hint of @xmath6 violation in charmed mesons is expected to be from physics beyond the standard model and hence charm may be instrumental in providing insights into new physics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , earlier focus  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and various other collaborations had produced many interesting results in the charm sector .",
    "the @xmath8 hint  @xcite of a difference of @xmath6 asymmetries between the singly suppressed @xmath9 and @xmath10 charmed decay modes resulted in a large volume of work  @xcite , mostly using different models of new physics , to explain the result .",
    "the hint has since then been slowly moving towards zero and currently there seems to be no evidence for any direct @xmath6 violation in charm in any mode  @xcite .",
    "even though this hint for the @xmath6 asymmetry slowly disappeared , from all the recent work done on the charm decays to two pesudoscalar modes motivated by this hint , it was clear that it is critical to first understand the observed branching ratios of all the charmed hadronic decay modes well , within the standard model , before any observation of an anomalous rate or any new cp asymmetry can be claimed to be , due to the presence of new physics .    however , this is not an easy task .",
    "the mass of the charm quark ( @xmath11 gev ) makes it very difficult to come up with a proper theoretical technique for calculation of hadronic charmed meson decays .",
    "the charm , unlike the bottom quark , is not sufficiently heavy to allow realization of the infinitely heavy quark limit .",
    "therefore , the well - known theoretical approaches based on qcd , for example , heavy quark effective theory  @xcite , qcd factorization  @xcite , the perturbative qcd approach  @xcite and the soft - collinear effective theory  @xcite , which lead to very satisfactory predictions for @xmath7 decays , can not be used to explain data in the case of charmed mesons .",
    "furthermore , the charm quark is also not light enough for a chiral expansion to be applicable .    in the absence of any other reliable and effective theoretical methods ,",
    "the factorization approach is still one of the most successful ways to study two - body charm meson decays  @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known now that in the naive factorization approach , calculation of wilson coefficients of effective operators faces the problem of @xmath12- and renormalization scheme dependence .",
    "these difficulties can be overcome in the frame - work of the @xmath13generalized factorization approach where wilson coefficients are effective and include important non - factorizable ( nf ) corrections  @xcite .    in the past",
    "there was another attempt to explain hadronic d decays using the so called large @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is number of colour degrees of freedom ) approach  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that dropping fierz transformed terms characterized by @xmath14 can narrow the gap between predictions and observations up to a satisfactory level .",
    "the calculations based on qcd sum rules showed that fierz terms were certainly compensated by the nf corrections  @xcite .",
    "there exists another model independent so called @xmath13quark diagram or @xmath13topological diagram approach in the literature  @xcite where all two - body non - leptonic weak decays of heavy mesons are expressed in terms of distinct quark diagrams , depending on the topologies of weak interactions , including all strong interaction effects .",
    "it is based on @xmath16 symmetry , and allows extraction of the quark diagram amplitudes by fitting against experimental data .",
    "however su(3 ) breaking effects in charmed meson decays have been shown to be important and need to be carefully incorporated  @xcite .",
    "the importance of final state interactions ( fsi ) in nonleptonic charm decays had been realized and discussed in several papers  @xcite in the early 80 s , where the authors had been intrigued by the anomalies in the observed branching ratios of the cabibbo favoured ( cf ) , neutral versus the charged @xmath17 modes , the differing rates of the singly cabibbo suppressed ( scs ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes , followed by measurements of rates of few other modes that had unexpected suppression / enhancement .",
    "many of these were conjectured to be due to fsi .",
    "surprisingly , even in the last couple of years , in many of the papers that worried about the charm cp asymmetry problem , these old puzzles were still considered unresolved .    even for the case of hadronic b",
    "meson decays , the role of fsi s is being examined rather carefully in the last few years  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the charmed meson lies right in the heart of the resonance region .",
    "hence , resonant final state rescattering is bound to play a bigger role in the two body hadronic charm decays and needs to be evaluated .",
    "of course dynamical calculations of these long distance effects are not possible and hence they can only be determined phenomenologically after comparison of the theoretical estimates with experimental data .",
    "unitarity constraints play an important role in providing the theoretical estimates .",
    "another contribution in hadronic two body decays that has been debated for a long period is that of the weak annihilation and exchange diagrams .",
    "one of rosen s proposal  @xcite had been that the w exchange diagrams may be large and since this appears only in @xmath18 and not in @xmath19 decays , it could account for the difference in the lifetimes of these two mesons .",
    "bigi and fukugita  @xcite had then proposed several @xmath20 and @xmath7 meson decay modes that could be the smoking gun signals of the w - exchange contributions and yet , when the mode @xmath21 was observed , it was argued  @xcite that it could have been generated from the decay mode @xmath22 , with this final state rescattering to the @xmath23 mode .",
    "annihilation type contributions along with fsi s were incorporated in the hadronic two body vector - pseudoscalar modes of charmed meson decays in ref .",
    "studies using the quark diagram approach of ref .",
    "@xcite had also indicated that annihilation type contributions are needed to explain the observed data .    in this paper , we study the role of fsi in the two body @xmath20 ( @xmath20 here can be any of the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath24 ) meson decays .",
    "we assume that fsi effects are dominated by resonance states close to the mass of @xmath20 mesons .",
    "in fact , there exist isospin @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 resonances near the @xmath20 mass , that may contribute to rescatterings among different channels in these respective isospin states and enhance / suppress some of the decay rates . in the next section ,",
    "we give the formalism for the calculation of the un - unitarized amplitudes , using a modified factorization approach , where the effective wilson coefficients include nf corrections .",
    "this is in analogy with the qcd factorization approach of beneke - neubert for hadronic @xmath7 meson decays  @xcite , where however , using the hard scattering approach , the nf corrections are calculable in heavy quark approximation .",
    "however , for charm , since this approximation fails , these nf corrections are not calculable and are left as parameters .",
    "we also indicate our parametrization of the annihilation contributions and discuss our inputs : the decay constants , and the form factors , for which we have used a z - series expansion approach . in sec .",
    "[ final state interactions ] , we discuss the need to incorporate additional long distance fsi effects and show how this can be done with a k matrix formalism for coupled channels . using the observed widths , masses and known decay rates of the resonances to the various channels to evaluate the diagonal elements and leaving the unknown elements of the k matrix as parameters ,",
    "the unitarized amplitudes are calculated ( as discussed in  @xcite ) to estimate the branching ratios of all the scs , cf and doubly cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) @xmath0 decay modes . in sec .",
    "[ numerical analysis ] , we list the isospin decomposition of all the decay modes , the parameters that need to be determined from our fits as well as the errors in theoretical inputs used .",
    "we list all the branching ratios after our numerical @xmath28 fits as well as the values of the fitted parameters .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the study of weak decays of charmed mesons to two body hadronic modes necessarily requires a careful evaluation of the strong interaction corrections .",
    "the weak effective hamiltonian may be expressed in terms of coefficient functions , which incorporate the strong interaction effects above the scale @xmath29 and the current - current operators as : @xmath30+h.c.~. \\label{(hamiltonian)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath31 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the wilson coefficients and the operators are , @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the above are colour indices , while @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be either the @xmath39 or the @xmath40 quark .",
    "the quark diagrams dominantly contributing to the branching ratios of @xmath41  @xcite are the colour - favoured tree amplitude @xmath42 , the colour - suppressed amplitude @xmath43 , the w - exchange amplitude @xmath44 and the w annihilation amplitude @xmath45 , shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] .",
    "penguin contributions in charmed meson decays are highly suppressed as the dominant down type quark contribution to the flavour changing neutral current @xmath46 transition is from the @xmath47 quark which is accompanied by the presence of the tiny product , @xmath48 of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "hence , the two operators in eq .",
    "( [ ( hamiltonian ) ] ) are sufficient for calculating the amplitudes and branching ratios of the @xmath0 modes .    in the naive factorization approach ,",
    "the matrix element of the four - fermion operator in the heavy quark decay is replaced by a product of two currents .",
    "the amplitudes for the non - leptonic 2 body decay modes are then the product of a transition form factor and a decay constant .",
    "however , nf corrections must exist ; while such corrections for scales larger than @xmath49 are taken into consideration in the effective weak hamiltonian , those below this scale also need to be carefully incorporated . in the qcd factorization approach for @xmath7 meson",
    "decays  @xcite , these nf corrections are handled using the hard scattering approach , where the vertex corrections and the hard spectator interactions are added at the next to leading order in @xmath50 and its accuracy is limited only by the corrections to the heavy quark limit .",
    "but , in the case of charm decays , where the heavy quark expansion is not a very good approximation , it is best to parametrize these nf corrections and then determine them by fitting the theoretical branching ratios with the experimental data . in the diagrammatic approach of ref .",
    "@xcite also , either the wilson coefficients themselves or the nf corrections appearing in the wilson coefficients are determined from fits to data .",
    "hence , we write the scale dependent wilson coefficients , modified to include the nf corrections which are parametrized by @xmath51 and @xmath52 with their respective phases @xmath53 and @xmath54 as , @xmath55 the dominant tree and colour amplitudes for @xmath41 , where @xmath56 is the final meson which carries the spectator quark , while @xmath57 represents the meson emitted from the weak vertex ( as depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) , are then written as : @xmath58 where , @xmath59 is the @xmath57 meson decay constant and @xmath60 denotes the transition form factor for @xmath61 evaluated at @xmath62 .",
    "we follow the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite and choose the scale @xmath49 to be the energy release in individual decay processes rather than fixed at @xmath63 .",
    "this scale which is dependent on the final state masses , allows for su(3 ) breaking , additional to that coming from different decay constants and form factors .",
    "this scale is taken to be , @xmath64 , where , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is another free parameter .",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are taken to be universal for all the decay modes and are fitted from experimental data .      for a long time ,",
    "w - exchange and w - annihilation contributions used to be neglected due to the so - called helicity suppression .",
    "however , observation of many decay modes of charmed and bottom mesons , which are possible only via the annihilation or exchange diagrams have indicated that these contributions could be substantial .",
    "these short distance weak annihilation effects were hence included in the diagrammatic approach . in principle",
    "these could result from rescattering , even in the absence of annihilation and exchange processes .",
    "in fact , weak annihilation topologies were assumed to be induced by nearby resonances through fsi s in ref .",
    "the authors in  @xcite as well as ref .",
    "@xcite use su(3 ) to relate the couplings of the final state mesons with the resonances .",
    "this leads to the result that the long distance w - exchange contribution can be induced by a tree amplitude , while w - annihilation can be induced by a color suppressed internal w - emission .",
    "the resonant fsi modify the w - exchange and w - annihilation amplitudes but the t and c amplitudes are unaffected .",
    "we emphasize that the assumption of su(3 ) , plays an important role in these results . in a most general coupled channel formalism",
    ", all contributions in the various channels will be affected by the resonant fsi , as will be shown in sec .",
    "we parametrize the w - exchange and w - annihilation contributions in the amplitudes by @xmath67 and estimate them from phenomenological fits to data .",
    "the exchange(annihilation ) amplitudes are hence written as : @xmath68 since the initial charmed meson is annihilated and both the final mesons are produced from the weak vertex , after the production of a quark - antiquark pair from a gluon , these amplitudes are a product of the decay constants of the initial @xmath20 meson ( @xmath69 ) and that of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . apart from this , the strengths of the exchange(annihilation ) amplitudes @xmath72 are assumed to be the same for all modes and the subscripts distinguish the contributions of the pair production of the light quark - antiquark from that of the strange pair .",
    "since the annihilation and exchange contributions are necessarily non - factorizable , they depend only on @xmath73 rather than the modified coefficients @xmath74 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that for the case of decays to two pseudoscalar mesons , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the annihilation contributions the quark - antiquark pair production happens with gluon emission from the initial state quark .",
    "hence , this contribution is independent of the fsi effects that obviously involve the final state quarks and are discussed in sec .  [ final state interactions ] .",
    "hence inclusion of both weak annihilation / exchange contributions as well as fsi will not amount to double counting , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the scale of the wilson coefficients for the exchange and annihilation amplitudes must depend on both the mass ratios , @xmath75 and is taken to be , @xmath76  .",
    "we start by specifying our convention for the different mesons involved in our analysis : @xmath77    in the @xmath61 transitions , the matrix element of the vector current is written in terms of the form factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 as , @xmath80 where @xmath81 . the matrix element for the production of the second meson @xmath57 , is given by , @xmath82 hence , in the amplitude of the non - leptonic two pseudoscalar decay modes of charmed mesons involving the product of the two matrix elements specified in eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) , only the transition form factor @xmath79 appears .",
    "transition form factors can in principle be experimentally measured from the semi - leptonic decays , however , in the massless lepton limit , only the @xmath83 contributes to the semi - leptonic amplitude distributions .",
    "however , the semi - leptonic information is still useful , since at zero momentum transfer the form factors obey the kinematic constraint @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath79 on the other hand is accessible only with massive leptons in the semileptonic decays or in lattice simulations .",
    "simple and modified pole models have been widely used to parametrize the @xmath1 dependence of the form factors , but these have poor convergence properties .",
    "recently the z - expansion  @xcite has been introduced as a model independent parametrization of the @xmath1 dependence of form factors over the entire kinematic range and has been shown to have improved convergence properties . in this approach , based on analyticity and unitarity , the form factors are expressed as a series expansion in powers of @xmath85 , where z is a non - linear function of @xmath1 , with an overall mutiplicative function accounting for the sub - threshold poles and branch cuts , @xmath86 the series coefficients and prefactors can only be determined from fits to lattice or experimental data .",
    "in fact , cleo collaboration has determined these coefficients for the @xmath87 form factors from the semileptonic decays but , in the massless lepton limit .",
    "hence , for @xmath88 , we use lattice results to determine the first two coefficients .    in the becirevic and kaidalov ( bk )",
    "ansatz  @xcite , @xmath89 where , @xmath90 is the mass of the vector meson with flavour @xmath91 or @xmath92 , depending on the transition being @xmath93 or @xmath94 respectively . @xmath95 and @xmath36 are parameters to be fitted to experimental data and in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fermilab and lattice milc collaborations , have fitted these parameters to cleo - c data .",
    "the normalization @xmath96 and shape parameter determine the physical observables describing the form factors at large recoil and are given by , @xmath97 using these input parameters we can determine the first two coefficients of the series expansion in eq .",

    "for @xmath110 , cleo has determined @xmath111 using the semileptonic decay mode @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "hence we use this value to estimate @xmath113 . however , for @xmath114 , while the first observation of the decay mode @xmath115 has been reported by cleo in the same paper , but the form factor was not determined in this case , and hence we approximate , the @xmath113 for @xmath114 to be the same as that for @xmath116 .",
    "further , since it has been shown@xcite that the form factors and particularly their shape is insensitive to the spectator quark , the shape for both @xmath116 and @xmath114 , is assumed to be the same as that for the @xmath99 case .",
    "the @xmath117 have been estimated with some lattice studies using the ( @xmath98 ) values from a recent exploratory paper by bali _ et .",
    ". however , these have larger uncertainties , since even the lowest pion mass used is still far from the physical mass .",
    "hence , for @xmath118 we take the form factors to be similar to that of @xmath100 and for @xmath119 we take them to be similar to @xmath99 .",

    "there have been speculations  @xcite that this mode can arise just from final state interactions , even in the absence of a weak exchange contribution .",
    "however , from table  [ table : brvalscs ] it is clear that without the exchange contribution we are unable to generate a large enough rate : both final state interaction and the exchange contribution are necessary for consistency with the measured branching fraction .",
