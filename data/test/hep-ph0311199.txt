    "however , there are several different candidate models in the higgs sector .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is a special case of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , is of particular theoretical interest .",
    "the standard model higgs boson has been experimentally excluded by lep searches for @xmath3 if its mass is lighter than approximately @xmath4  gev / c@xmath5@xcite . in the mssm ,",

    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the heavy quark",
    "effective theory ( hqet)@xcite , the top quark mass is assumed to be much heavier than the higgs boson mass and all relevant energy scales . assuming the hqet total inclusive cross - sections have been calculated at nlo for scalar@xcite and pseudoscalar production@xcite and also at nnlo for scalar@xcite and for pseudoscalar@xcite production , see also@xcite .",

    "the nlo qcd corrections to the higgs plus one jet process have only been computed in the hqet , since the full virtual corrections would require the evaluation of massive two - loop integrals for a @xmath22 reaction .",

    "our results make it clear that these can only be applied to the mssm in certain regions . at large @xmath14 , using the bottom - quark only is a very good approximation in the mssm . at small @xmath14",
    "the mssm pseudoscalar is top - quark loop dominated , whereas the lightest scalar in the mssm still receives important contributions from both the top- and bottom - quarks over a much broader range of @xmath14 .",
