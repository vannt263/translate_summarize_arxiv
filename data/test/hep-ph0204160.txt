    "solar neutrino deficit has been strongly established in all the first generation solar neutrino experiments @xcite and in the already started second generation experiments @xcite .",
    "the observed solar neutrino flux is considerably lesser than the standard solar model ( ssm ) predictions @xcite .",
    "this leads one to assume the non - standard neutrino properties .",
    "the recognised solutions to this solar neutrino problem ( snp ) based on the nonstandard neutrino properties are the the following : neutrino oscillations ( low msw , vo - qvo and lma msw ) ; neutrino magnetic moment solutions ( resonant spin - flavour precession ( rsfp ) and non - resonant spin - flavour precession ( nrsfp ) ) and the nonstandard neutrino interactions ( nris ) .",
    "however the most pouplar solution to the snp is the oscillation solution ( lma msw ) , yet the recent ( post - sno ) data equally favours the neutrino magnetic moment solutions @xcite . in the present work it is assumed that the rsfp @xcite of solar neutrinos is solely responsible for the neutrino deficit .",
    "this scenario is based on the presence of non - zero neutrino transition magnetic moment interaction with the transverse solar magnetic field along the path of neutrino trajectory .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana particles the rsfp converts @xmath2 into @xmath3 or @xmath4 , which are sterile for the chlorine detector but do contribute in kamiokande / superkamiokande and in sno event rates through comparatively smaller neutral current cross - sections .",
    "rsfp of neutrinos can explain not only the solar neutrino deficit but also the apparent time variations ( anticorrelation ) @xcite not confirmed or disproved yet of the solar neutrino flux with the solar magnetic activity .    despite the unestablished argument of anticorrelation",
    ", there are several reasons which motivate rsfp and its conequences for solar neutrinos .",
    "in fact , different degrees of suppression @xcite in the survival probabilities of the low energy ( pp - neutrinos ) , intermediate energy ( @xmath5,cno , pep - neutrinos ) and high energy part of @xmath6-neutrino sector , is the inbuilt feature of rsfp . furthermore , it has been found that the event rate fits for rsfp from the solar neutrino experiments are remarkably better than those for the best oscillation solution ( lma msw ) @xcite whereas the fits for recoil energy spectrum in superkamiokande are found nearly of the same quality as that of lma msw @xcite . by analysing the solar neutrino data within the framework of rsfp scenario",
    "it has been noted that the quality of data fit is very sensitive to the magnetic field profiles used @xcite .",
    "the strongest field intensity corresponds to the lowest survival probability and vice - versa . and",
    "in this way rsfp explains the general shape of probability , which naturally appears as a reflection of the field profile .",
    "conversely , a particular shape of the magnetic field profile can be obtained from the scenario , as a reflection of solar neutrino data .",
    "the procedure in the present work of extracting the profile from the rsfp framework is more detailed and transparent than that has been done with the other authers @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "a rough estimate of the solar neutrino data @xcite has been used for a qualitative analysis and thereby the field profile function is derived . and",
    "the effects on the shape of the profile on changing the neutrino parameters and the solar neutrino data have also been investigated .",
    "the paper has been divided in four sections . the solar magnetic field , at the present status ,",
    "is briefed in section-2 . in section-3",
    "the derivation of the field profile from the rsfp scenario is achieved . and",
    ", the section-4 is devoted to the results and the discussion .",
    "very little is known about the magnetic field inside the sun . apart from the anormous success of the ssm in predicting the thermal and nuclear evolution inside the sun it does not through enough light on the solar magnetic properties . in the most realistic mhd model of regular magnetic fields in the convective zone ,",
    "the main component of field is toroidal with opposite polarities in the northern and the southern solar hemispheres .",
    "the mhd models @xcite do not exclude the presence of a significant magnetic field of few hundred kilogauss at the bottom of the convective zone ( cz ) .",
    "the convective field is somehow caused by the relative rotation of solar layers in the convective zone . at the sunspot",
    "maximum the surface field may reach @xmath7gauss inside the spot and in the sunspot minimum the field falls below @xmath8 g. below the surface to the bottom of the cz the field can not be measured directly except for an upper limit of 300 kg from helioseismological data @xcite .",
    "there are recent models @xcite which argue that the field generation of about @xmath9 kg occurs in the shear layer near the bottom of cz .",
    "a strong field of @xmath10 g extending over @xmath11 km at the bottom of the convective zone would force the cz to extend deep enough to sufficiently distroy the @xmath12 abundance though not completely destroying it during the @xmath13 yrs @xcite .    below the bottom of the convective zone , the field could be large but the field response time due to plasma effect is of the order of @xmath14 yrs in this region @xcite .",
    "such a field , if it exists , will remain frozen over the intire life history of sun .",
    "parker , in reference @xcite has shown that a field in excess of @xmath15 g in the central core would be lost from the sun during its evolution as a consequence of its buoyancy . unlike the cz ,",
    "the radiative zone ( rz ) is not continuously mixed and rotates as a solid body .",
    "the properties of the magnetic fields in the interior of the sun has been investigated by some authers @xcite by considering the poloidal nature of magnetic fields . according to a recent study by friedland _",
    "et al . _ , a toroidal field of complex spatial structure can exist in the rz @xcite .    in the absence of reliable knowledge of solar magnetic fields from the astrophysical observations it becomes worthwhile to extract the solar magnetic field profile from the solar neutrino data within the framework of rsfp scenario .",
    "however , the bounds discussed above can offer little help to constrain the magnitude of field in the solar interior .",
    "in the rsfp scenario for majorana neutrino flavours in the chiral basis ( @xmath16 ) the neutrino propagation in the solar medium with a transverse component of magnetic field `` @xmath17 '' , can be described by a schrodinger - like evolution equation i (    c _ e + _ + _ e + _    )   =  h   (    c _ e + _ + _ e + _    )   with the hamiltonian matrix given by    h  =  (    cccc ^2 + a__e & 2 & 0 & ^ * b + 2 & ^2 + a _ _ & -^ * b & 0 + 0 & b & ^2- a__e & 2 + -b & 0 & 2 & ^2- a _",
    "_    ) ,    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the vacuum mixing angle and @xmath20 denotes the transition ( off - diagonal ) magnetic moment .",
    "the diagonal magnetic moments are absent for the majorana neutrinos as a consequence of cpt invariance .",
    "the matter potentials for a neutral unpolarised medium are given by a__e",
    "=  g_f  ( n_e- ) ,   + a _ _  =  -g_f  n_n  . where @xmath21 is the fermi constant and @xmath22 are the number densities of electrons , neutrons , respectively , in the solar medium .",
    "+    in the framework , the neutrino propagation is considered to be adiabatic except for a small region in the vicinity of resonance , where the two eigenvalues are the closest , there is a chance of nonadiabatic behaviour that the neutrino may jump from one eigenvalue to the other .",
    "this nonadiabatic effect is measured by the crossing probability between the eigenvalues . for ` @xmath19 ' vanishingly small , the spin - flavour conversion ( @xmath23 is governed by the `` @xmath24 '' submatrix (    cc a__e & ^ * b + -b & -a _ _    ) at resonance , the diagonal elements of the matrix are equal    n_e  =   +     here @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the approximation @xmath27 . the equation can be further simplified as the following  =   the electron density in the sun follows an exponential behaviour along the neutrino trajectory and is well approximated by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the radial distance from the sun and @xmath30 is the solar radius .",
    "now , by eliminating the factor @xmath31 in eqn .",
    "( 3 ) , one can obtain  =   2.535 10 ^ -11 exp  ( -r/0.09 r_s )  ev from equation ( 4 ) , the resonance points in the solar interior can be derived as r  =  0.09  r_s  ln  (  5.07  10 ^ -11  ev )    assuming a linear density fall off along the nonadiabatic region , the crossing probability in the landau - zener approximation is given by p_lz  =  exp  ( -  _ rsfp ) here , @xmath32 is the adiabaticity parameter _",
    "rsfp  =  0.09r_s )  , which is very sensitive to the nature of magnetic field profile @xmath33 .",
    "+ here @xmath34 , the position of the resonance points in the units of solar radius .",
    "an approximate survival probability for neutrinos , when they all are assumed to be produced at the same point , can be obtained by using the analysis of parke @xcite as p_sur  =   +  (  -  p_lz )    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the rsfp mixing angles at the beginning and at the end of the neutrino trajectory and are defined as @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the matter potential at the production point of neutrinos .",
    "when neutrinos are born far from the resonance and then pass through it , the mixing angles can be well approximated as @xmath39 and the total survival probability is given by p_sur  =  exp  ( -  0.09r_s )  .",
    "now , using equation ( 4 ) , one can eliminate the factor @xmath40 from the above equation as p_sur  =  exp  ( -  0.09r_s )  . and",
    "in this way , the desired field profile can be extracted from eqn .",
    "( 10 ) , as b(x )  =  exp  ( -x/0.18 )  .",
    "the profile can be further generalised as b(x )  =  exp  ( -x/0.18 )  . where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the derived profile ( 12 ) is exponential in nature which shows a strong dependence on the exponential behaviour of the solar matter density distribution used in the derivation @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the profile is a function of magnetic moment and the survival probability of neutrinos .",
    "however , the exponent of the profile is a function of `` @xmath43 '' and neutrino energy , `` e '' .",
    "the effects of the neutrino parameters and the solar neutrino data on the shape of the profile has a detail study in this section . for a model calculation , the solar neutrino spectrum @xmath44 has been categorised in three energy bands : low energy @xmath45 ; intermediate energy @xmath46 and high energy @xmath47 . assuming @xmath48 are the three central values of the survival probabilities corresponding to the three categories of the neutrinos , respectively .",
    "now the field profile equation ( 12 ) can be rewritten as b_1(x_l )  =  exp  ( -x_l/0.18 ) b_2(x_i )  =  exp  ( -x_i/0.18 ) b_3(x_h )  =  exp  ( -x_h/0.18 )    assuming @xmath49=@xmath50 ( @xmath51 is bohr magneton ) and @xmath52 [ the pattern of survival probabilities taken has only a qualitative importance . however , this pattern is not supported by the recent global analysis ( @xmath53 ) ] .",
    "the field distribution has been obtained for eqns .",
    "( 13 - 15 ) and shown in figure 1",
    ".    the three patches of field seen in the figure are as a result of one to one correspondence with the three energy bands assumed in the solar neutrino spectrum . the first patch",
    "[ @xmath54 corresponds to the resonance points of the mildly suppressed low energy neutrinos ; the strongly suppressed intermediate energy neutrinos reflect the magnetic field points of the second patch [ @xmath55 and the resonance points of the moderately supressed high energy neutrinos provide the field points corresponding to the third patch [ @xmath56 .",
    "the strongest field corresponds to the second ( middle ) patch is a result of large conversion of the intermediate energy neutrinos . and the moderate field in the third patch",
    "is reflected by the moderate conversion for the high energy sector of the @xmath6 neutrinos .",
    "however , unlike this , less conversion of low energy neutrinos could nt reflect a very weak magnetic field in the first patch because according to the eqn .",
    "( 5 ) the low energy neutrinos resonate in the inner part of sun region of higher matter density .",
    "so , larger field is required to compete with the higher effective resonance density in order to obtain small adiabatic conversion ( 10% ) for pp - neutrinos .",
    "the effect of the neutrino magnetic moment , for the same set of data and constant @xmath43 , has been shown in fig .",
    "2 . it affects equally all the three patches of the field . for small magnetic moment ( @xmath58 ) the field is increased by one order at all the points of the profile as compared to the field distribution for large magnetic moment ( @xmath59=@xmath50 ) .",
    "so any change in the `` @xmath59 '' scales the magnetic field strength at all the points by the same amount .",
    "the change in the value of @xmath43 shifts the positions of resonance points of neutrinos as can be seen from eqn .",
    "the parameter ( @xmath43 ) appears in eqn .",
    "( 12 ) in such an indirect way that it can only shift the field profile along the x - axis .",
    "the effect of its variation for constant @xmath59 and the same set of data on the field profile has been shown in the figure 3 . in the figure there are shown three sets of the profile , which corresponds to the three different values of @xmath43 .",
    "set - i : @xmath60 ; set - ii : @xmath61 ; set - iii : @xmath62 . for large value of @xmath43 as the resonance points are shifted towards the solar interior thereby the field profile",
    "is accordingly shifted to the region . for a smaller value of @xmath43",
    "the profile is moved towards the surface and for @xmath63 it extends beyond the solar surface as shown in the figure .",
    "the amplitude strength of the magnetic field profile ( 12 ) is also sensitive to the solar neutrino data .",
    "the effect for constant @xmath59 and @xmath43 has been shown in the fig .",
    "two arbitrary sets of data are used + set - i : @xmath64 + set - ii : @xmath65 + it has been noted that the change of survival probability of any of the neutrino category , the field is scaled as a square root of negative of logarithmic value of the probability at the same point of the corresponding field patch .",
    "so for any variation of the solar neutrino data , only the amplitude of the profile gets affected .    in the present work",
    ", it has been noted that derived profile function is a hidden characteristic of rsfp scenario and it is the nature of function ( e.g. exponential in the present case ) which doest depend on the solar neutrino observations and the neutrino parameters .",
    "the solar neutrino data can only constrain the amplitude of the profile and the neutrino parameters can only shift the profile or scale the field amplitude along the axes .",
    "the derived profile function is found to be strongly depending on the matter density distribution of the solar interior .",
    "furthermore , the profile can exist radially of course in any part of solar interior .",
    "it is the value of @xmath43 which confirms its place inside the sun .",
    "for @xmath66 the profile exists in the convective zone and for @xmath67 the profile shifts to the radiative zone of sun .",
    "the relevance of this model work remains viable whether kamland @xcite proves lma msw as a solution for snp or not .",
    "as , if lma is confirmed as a solution , even then rsfp can survive as a sub - leading effect . and",
    "if lma is ruled out then the chances of rsfp to exist as a dominant solution can not be ignored .",
    "it is the next awaited experiment borexino which will decide the fate of rsfp @xcite",
    ".    to conclude , the solution to snp based on the neutrino spin flavour flip in the transverse solar magnetic field ( rsfp ) is appealing from the point of view of the data fits .",
    "rsfp can happen in the relic frozen/ constant field of radiative zone ( see ref.@xcite and b.c .",
    "_ in @xcite ) ; in this way the generic consequences of rsfp in the convective zone of sun ( 11 years and semiannual variations of neutrino signal which have not been observed ) can be avoided .",
    "if rsfp is a true solution of solar neutrino problem ( snp ) it becomes more plausible to study the profile derived in the present work from the inbuilt structure of the framework rather to impose a profile from outside for the @xmath68 testing .",
    "one of such excercises of",
    "@xmath68 testing has been proved successful ( see our paper in @xcite ) , recently , where we have assumed this profile ( 12 ) existing in the radiation zone of sun . and , interestingly ,",
    "this profile has been found as the best suited one in the light of the most recent ( post sno ) data .",
