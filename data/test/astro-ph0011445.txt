    "in galactic astronomy , the most intensely studied of the problems of pattern formation is the problem of the formation of spiral structure , which has brought forth numerous theoretical and numerical approaches .",
    "even though at the present time there exists , as yet , no satisfactory theory of the origin and conservation of the spiral structure so prominent in the milky way and many other giant flattened galaxies , the majority of experts in the field has yielded to the opinion that the study of the stability of the small - amplitude cooperative oscillations in disk - shaped galaxies of stars is the first step towards an understanding of the phenomena .",
    "this is because in the milky way and many other disk galaxies , the bulk of the luminous mass , probably @xmath1 , is in the stars .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the spiral structures are intimately connected with the stellar constituent of a galaxy , and that stellar dynamical phenomena play a basic role .",
    "because of the long - range nature of the gravitational force between stars , a galaxy exhibits collective modes of motions  modes in which the stars in large regions move coherently or in unison . a galaxy is characterized also by a high  temperature \" ( a dispersion of random velocities of stars ) and hence a high  thermal \" energy ; this thermal energy is much larger than the interaction potential between pairs of stars .",
    "because of this , binary encounters produce only small - scale scattering of the motions of the stars . over long enough times ,",
    "these gradually build up to produce large deflections that constitute collisions . in many cases",
    "these collisional effects are so weak that we consider the galaxy as collisionless on the hubble time @xmath2 yr ( chandrasekhar , 1960 ; binney and tremaine , 1987 ) .",
    "thus , the galaxy is dominated by the collective motions and the free streaming of the stars ( kinetic effects ) .    as usual it is very difficult determine a priori whether a particular linearization of nonlinear equations made in analytical studies constitutes a valid approximation .",
    "this can be determined , however , by direct computer simulations of the nonlinear theory that mimic the behaviour of stars in galaxies .",
    "such modeling gives more detailed information than can be obtained analytically , so that the important physical phenomena can be determined . in this paper , the results of the approximate theoretical analysis described in the appendix are compared with our own many - body ( @xmath3-body ) simulations .",
    "one of the goals of the simulation is to test the validities of a modified local criterion for stability of jeans - type gravity perturbations in a self - gravitating , infinitesimally thin and collisionless disk .",
    "the fact that the nonaxisymmetric perturbations in the differentially rotating system are more unstable than the axisymmetric ones is taken into account in this modified toomre - like ( toomre , 1964 , 1977 ) criterion .",
    "in addition to the stability criterion we are interested in how model particles diffuse in velocity . as for the present study ,",
    "such random velocity diffusion is caused by stellar disk turbulence .",
    "in particular , we verify the analytical prediction that as the jeans - unstable perturbations grow the mean - square velocity increases linearly with time .",
    "the observation of this behavior is a sensitive test of the model as well as the kinetic theory of stellar disks .",
    "in fact , morozov ( 1981 ) and griv _ et al . _",
    "( 1999a ) already attempted to confirm the modified criterion numerically .",
    "however , because of the very small number of model stars , @xmath4 , morozov s results are subject to considerable uncertainties , and additional simulations are clearly required to settle the issue .",
    "furthermore , for that number of model particles , the two - body relaxation time scale is comparable to the crossing time , even with morozov s modest softening parameter , raising some question about the applicability of his simulations to actual almost collisionless galaxies .",
    "increasing the number of model stars is definitely a more reliable procedure . in turn , griv _ et al . _ used a different numerical approach of the so - called local @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "the @xmath3-body experiments in a local or hill s approximation has been pioneered by toomre ( 1990 ) , toomre and kalnajs ( 1991 ) and salo ( 1995 ) . in these simulations dynamics of particles in small regions of the disk are assumed to be statistically independent of dynamics of particles in other regions .",
    "the local numerical model thus simulates only a small part of the system and more distant parts are represented as copies of the simulated region . unlike morozov ( 1981 ) and griv _",
    "( 1999a ) , we study some aspects of dynamical behavior of stellar systems by global simulations using a sufficiently large number of particles .",
    "different methods are currently employed to simulate global evolution of collisionless point - mass systems of galaxies by @xmath3-body experiments .",
    "one algorithm for a simulation code that has found wide use was developed by hohl and hockney ( 1969 ) , hohl ( 1971 , 1972 ) , miller ( 1971 ) , hockney and brownrigg ( 1974 ) , quirk ( 1972 ) , athanassoula and sellwood ( 1986 ) , combes _",
    "( 1990 ) , pfenniger and friedli ( 1993 ) , merritt and sellwood ( 1994 ) , donner and thomasson ( 1994 ) , and others .",
    "the method samples the density field with a usually uniform grid .",
    "the poisson equation is then solved on this grid using one of a number of the fast solvers that are available , usually fast fourier transforms .",
    "this is an analog of plasma particle - in - cell ( pic ) codes .",
    "it is believed that simulating many billions of stars in actual galaxies by using only several ten or hundred thousands representative stars in pic experiments will be enough to capture the essential physics , which includes the ordinary star  star binary relaxation and wave - like collective motion . in other fields , such as the simulation of spiral structures ,",
    "pic codes may be used with moderate success .",
    "this is because these fine - scale @xmath5 kpc structures can basically be governed by collisionless processes . by increasing the number of cells to reproduce the microstructures ,",
    "one reduces the average number of particles per cell , and thus increases the undesirable effect of particle gravitational encounters .",
    "in addition , if one uses pic codes , then one can not resolve density fluctuations with wavelengths smaller than the size of a cell @xmath6 .",
    "this puts a lower limit on the wavelengths that it makes any sense to keep ; this lower limit is given by @xmath7 .",
    "other disadvantages of pic codes are possibilities of late - time loss of energy conservation , finite - grid and aliasing instabilities , and other numerical artifacts .",
    "pic method works well only for regions where there are many particles per cell .",
    "the problem is serious because there are regions in the phase space which are important to the problem but in which the distribution function is small . in general , since we will at most have a hundred particles in one cell we will have fluctuation of the order of @xmath8 or more which for many problems is unacceptable .    in another type of @xmath3-body simulation , ostriker and peebles ( 1973 ) , morozov ( 1981 ) , grivnev ( 1985 ) ,",
    "griv _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , griv and zhytnikov ( 1995 ) , griv and chiueh ( 1998 ) investigated a stellar disk by direct integration of newtonian equations of motion . following them ,",
    "we simulate here the evolution of a model for an isolated thin disk of a galaxy by direct integration of the equations of motion of stars : the force on a star @xmath9 due to all other stars is given by @xmath10^{3/2 } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the constant of gravitation , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mass , position and velocity of the @xmath9-th and of the @xmath16-th particle , respectively , and @xmath17 is the so - called cutoff radius .",
    "this  softening \" of the gravitational potential is a device often used in @xmath3-body simulations to avoid numerical difficulties at very close but rare encounters ( miller , 1971 ; romeo , 1998 ) .",
    "the constant parameter @xmath18 reduces the interaction at short ranges and puts a lower limit on the size of the particles , i.e. the stars in the system can no longer be considered as point - masses  they are in fact plummer spheres with a scale size @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the softening parameter @xmath18 leads to a more ",
    "collisionless \" situation .",
    "as is known , the latter @xmath3-body models suffer from graininess due to the finite number of particles .",
    "the graininess manifests itself as a numerical  noise \" in the calculation .",
    "the use of many model particles @xmath19 decreases drastically the noise level .",
    "although the direct integration method sounds simple and straighforward , practical computational limitations require the use of only few ten thousands representative stars .",
    "this is because we evaluate the sum on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for each star or @xmath3 times for @xmath3 stars .",
    "the sum itself contains @xmath3 terms ; each term requires a number of arithmetic operations  for the sake of estimating , let us say , ten",
    ". the total number of arithmetic operations required to evaluate the force will be of the order of @xmath20 . for the standard runge  kutta calculation involving @xmath21 stars the total number of operations would be about @xmath22 . assuming that we can do an operation in @xmath23 sec ,",
    "simply evaluating the forces would require about @xmath24 min .",
    "a typical calculation requires several thousand time steps so that @xmath25 h would be required .",
    "calculations of this magnitude are totally impractical for using such models to explore the physics of galaxies",
    ". the problem is solved by using the nowadays concurrent supercomputers : with the multiple processors in supercomputers it is possible to reduce the running time by processing more than one group of particles at a time .",
    "the use of , say , @xmath26 parallel computers would make such calculations practical . in the present study",
    ", we explore the inter university @xmath27 processors sgi origin @xmath28 supercomputer in israel .    note that pic codes only formally utilized a larger number of particles than direct integration codes .",
    "this is because in pic experiments , the disk plane was covered with a difference grid .",
    "the stars within grid cells as well as within a whole model did not interact gravitationally ; the computation of the mass density in cells followed a fast fourier transform to obtain the potential only at a restricted set of points  at the cell centers  by interpolation rules and thus to find the very approximate forces at the positions of the particles .",
    "this avoids the need to compute forces between particle pairs , and makes the amount of computation necessary to obtain the forces independent of @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , nothing similar exists in nature , and therefore it follows that one can not compare the number of particles used in these different kinds of simulations in any way at all .",
    "modern parallel computing technology on concurrent processors had led to a dramatic increase in the computing power .",
    "the latter allows us to use direct integration methods with a sufficiently large number of model stars @xmath0 .",
    "in general , the numerical procedure is first to seek stationary solutions to the boltzmann kinetic equation in the self - consistent field approximation for the density distribution , the angular velocity of regular rotation , the dispersion of random velocities of the stars , and then to calculate the stability of those solutions to small - amplitude gravity perturbations .    at the start of the @xmath3-body integration",
    ", our simulation initializes the particles on a set of @xmath26 circular rings with a circular velocity @xmath29 of galactic rotation in the @xmath30plane ; the system is isolated in vacuum .",
    "consider an uniformly rotating model disk of stars with a surface mass density variation given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the central surface density and @xmath33 is the radius of the initial disk . as a solution of a time - independent collisionless boltzmann equation , to ensure initial equilibrium the uniform angular velocity to balance the zero - velocity - dispersion disk ,",
    "@xmath34 was adopted ( hohl , 1971 , 1972 )",
    ". then the position of each particle was slightly perturbed by applying a pseudorandom number generator . for the uniformly rotating disk , the maxwellian - distributed random velocities with radial @xmath35 and azimuthal @xmath36 dispersions in the plane @xmath37 according to the familiar toomre s criterion ( toomre , 1964 , 1977 )",
    ", @xmath38 may be added ( @xmath39 ) to the initial circular velocities @xmath40 , where @xmath41^{1/2}$ ] is the ordinary epicyclic frequency ( hohl , 1971 , 1972 ) .",
    "it is crucial to realize that in this case , according to lau and bertin ( 1978 ) , lin and lau ( 1979 ) , bertin ( 1980 ) , lin and bertin ( 1984 ) , morozov ( 1980 ) , polyachenko ( 1989 ) , griv and peter ( 1996 ) , polyachenko and polyachenko ( 1997 ) , initially the disk is jeans - stable against the small - scale axisymmetric ( radial ) perturbations but unstable against the relatively large - scale nonaxisymmetric ( spiral ) perturbations .",
    "the initial vertical velocity dispersion was chosen equal to @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the angular velocity @xmath43 was replaced by ( hohl , 1971 , 1972 ) @xmath44 \\right\\}^{1/2 } .\\ ] ]    the sense of disk rotation was taken to be counterclockwise , and units are such that @xmath45 and the mass of a star @xmath46 .",
    "the cutoff radius was chosen @xmath47 . within the framework of our model , dynamically young stars",
    "form the very thin disk @xmath48 . therefore , at the start of simulations the disk thickness was chosen @xmath49 .",
    "a time @xmath50 is taken to correspond to a single revolution of the initial disk . in all experiments",
    "the simulation was performed up to a time @xmath51 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it should be noted here that after about three rotations the picture is always stabilized and practically no significant changes in gross properties of the model over this time are observed . any difference between the results of simulations with and without applying the so - called quiet starts procedure to select the very regular initial coordinates of particles was not found .",
    "( basically , by applying the method of quiet starts , one uses no random numbers in the initial conditions to suppress the noise level in a system .",
    "such techniques have proven useful in obtaining realistic noise levels without the use of a large number of particles ; byers and grewal , 1970 . )",
    "moreover , tests indicated that the results were insensitive to changes in other parameters , e.g. the number of stars in the range @xmath54 , the cutoff parameter in the range @xmath55 and the initial disk thickness in the range @xmath56 .",
    "spiral amplitudes detected in our simulations are greatly in excess of an expectation from the level of particle noise and do not scale with @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior is clearly inconsistent with the hypothesis that the nonaxisymmetric structure in the models can be attributed to collisional effects , inappropriate values of @xmath18 or swing - amplified particle noise as advocated by toomre ( 1990 ) .",
    "finally , slight corrections have been applied to the resultant velocities and coordinates of the model stars so as to ensure the equilibrium between the centrifugal and gravitational forces , to preserve the position of the disk center of gravity at the origin and to include the weak effect of the finite thickness of the disk to the gravitational potential .",
    "thus , the initial model is very near the dynamical equilibrium for all radii .",
    "the system of equations of motion ( 1 ) for @xmath3 particles was integrated by the standard runge ",
    "kutta method of the fourth order .",
    "all the particles move with the same constant runge ",
    "kutta time step @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the orbital period .",
    "in order to be compared with an actual galaxy of stars , the numerical model of the disk should properly simulate a collisionless system .",
    "otherwise , as it has been shown , e.g. by morozov _",
    "et al . _ ( 1985 ) and griv _ et al . _",
    "( 2000a ) , a collisional disk is unstable with respect to a secular dissipative - type instability .",
    "the secular instability of spontaneous gravity perturbations might arise merely from the dissipation of the energy of regular rotation into ever larger amounts of heat when the system has moderate dissipation ; it results from perturbations which have negative energy in the dissipative medium ( morozov _ et al .",
    "_ , 1985 ; fridman and polyachenko , 1984 , vol .",
    "2 , p. 243 ) .",
    "the secular instability produces structures completely unrelated to the effects we would like to model . in the spirit of the simple  molecular - kinetic \" theory by chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) ,",
    "the collisional relaxation time for a three - dimensional system from the point of view of deflections suffered by a test star in encounters with a given distribution of field objects is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the averaged velocity dispersion , @xmath61 is the  field \" particle mass and @xmath62 its three - dimensional number density .",
    "also @xmath63 is the so - called newton ( or coulomb in plasmas ) logarithm , by means of which the long - range nature of the gravitational force is taken into account ; to the order of magnitude @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the total number of field particles . in actual galaxies",

    "( 5 ) , the chosen quantities @xmath60 , @xmath3 , etc .",
    "guarantee that the model may be considered as a collisionless one to a good approximation at least during @xmath67 rotations .",
    "so we expect , in our numerical calculations because @xmath3 is large , relaxation from two - body gravitational interactions is unimportant .",
    "we suggest that the structures observed in the @xmath3-body simulations originate from the collective modes of practically collisionless galactic models  gravitational jeans - type modes and bending firehose - type modes ( see below section 4.2 ) .",
    "consider a system of mutually gravitating particles .",
    "the local distribution function @xmath68 must satisfy the boltzmann kinetic equation @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total gravitational potential determined self - consistently from the poisson equation , @xmath71 @xmath72 is the so - called collisional integral which defines the change of @xmath73 arising from ordinary interparticle collisions , @xmath74 is the collision frequency and @xmath75 is the quasi - steady state distribution function ( binney and tremaine , 1987 , p.  506 ; griv _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000a )",
    ".    in plasma physics , lifshitz and pitaevskii ( 1981 , p. 115 ) have discussed phenomena in which interparticle collisions are unimportant , and such a plasma is said to be collisionless ( and in the lowest - order approximation of the theory one can neglect the collision integral in the kinetic equation ) .",
    "it was shown that a necessary condition is that @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the typical frequency of collective oscillations : then the collision operator in the kinetic equation is small in comparison with @xmath78 . in the appendix",
    ", we have shown that the frequency of jeans oscillations in a stellar disk @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , in the gravitation case in the lowest - order approximation of the theory we can neglect the effects of collisions between particles on a time scale of many rotations if @xmath80 .",
    "lifshitz and pitaevskii have pointed out that collisions may be neglected also if the particle mean free path is large compared with the wavelength of collective oscillations .",
    "then the collision integral in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is small in comparison with the term @xmath81 .    in this subsection",
    ", we test numerically if the models used in our @xmath3-body simulations are being correctly modeled as collisionless boltzmann ( vlasov ) systems .",
    "the direct method of checking if the system is being modeled as a collisionless system is to repeat a calculation using a mass spectrum ( rybicki , 1971 ) .",
    "it is obvious that as a result of gravitational collisions there is a tendency towards energy equipartition between the various masses .",
    "hohl ( 1973 ) has determined the experimental relaxation time and compared it with a theoretical prediction for the collisional relaxation time of a two - dimensional disk .",
    "here we do such a comparison by using the three - dimensional system .",
    "let us consider the three - dimensional computer model consisting of @xmath82 stars of mass @xmath83 , @xmath84 stars of mass @xmath85 and @xmath86 stars of mass @xmath87 .",
    "the total number of stars , which are distributed in the system in accord with the law ( 2 ) is @xmath88 .",
    "initially , the different mass groups of stars are distributed with the same velocity dispersion ( with different temperatures ) .    in the appendix of the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that the disk becomes almost stable gravitationally for @xmath89 .",
    "in such a jeans - stable system collective effects associated with the classical gravitational instability will not affect the random velocity dispersion of particles : then the change of velocity dispersion can be explained only by usual two - body encounters .",
    "for this reason the initial condition was chosen to be a quasi - stable uniformly rotating disk with @xmath90 .",
    "following chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) and hohl ( 1973 ) , let us define the relaxation time @xmath91 as the time required for the mean change of the kinetic energy per unit mass of the test star to equal the initial kinetic energy .    in figure 1",
    "we show the change of the ratio of the mean particle ( kinetic ) energy , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( in units of the total kinetic energy of the system ) , for the different mass groups , where @xmath95 is the total velocity of a given mass group . as is expected , the two groups of heavy stars lose energy while the group of lightest stars gains an approximately corresponding amount of kinetic energy .",
    "also as is expected , one can see the decrease in the change of the kinetic energy with time .",
    "this is because the collisional frequency @xmath96 is inversely proportional to the velocity dispersion ( eq . [ 5 ] ) , and thus the encounters only weakly affect the stars with high random velocities .",
    "as one can see , the mean slope of the curves shown in figure 1 will result in energy equipartition after about @xmath97 rotation periods .",
    "it is crucial to realize that these relaxation times even for this relatively small number of model stars are much longer that the time of a single disk revolution .",
    "we conclude that the computer models used in the present study may be considered as collisionless ones to a good approximation at least during the first @xmath53 rotations which are of especial interest in spiral - galaxy simulation .",
    "therefore , we argue that the collective effects studied in the paper were apparent before the collisional time scale associated with the binary interactions of stars was reached .      to study the development of spiral structure and to confirm the theoretical predictions made in the appendix , warm disks with initial radial velocity dispersion of identical stars equal to toomre s ( 1964 ) stabilizing velocity dispersion @xmath98",
    "were modeled .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of the development of spiral structures .",
    "the structure grows rapidly on a dynamical time scale @xmath99 . at",
    "a time @xmath100 a multi - armed filamentary spiral structure forms with several short , tightly wound trailing arms .",
    "soon after , at @xmath101 a bar structure appears with two almost symmetrical open spiral arms .",
    "however , sometimes , e.g. at @xmath102 or at @xmath103 , one can see a  one - armed \" galaxy consisting of a prominent arm and a short , diffuse second one .",
    "after @xmath104 rotations , the spiral arms almost disappear , and a bar forms in the central parts of the system .",
    "the @xmath105 instability shifts the point with highest density from the center of mass .",
    "it is interesting to note that in many disk - shaped galaxies , e.g. in the spiral galaxies m 101 and ngc 1300 , there appears to be a deviation from rotational symmetry . in principle",
    ", such a deviation may be due to this one arm instability .",
    "note that the latter has already been suggested by b. lindblad ( see toomre , 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , asymmetries in the distribution of light in spiral galaxies have been known for a long time .",
    "et al . _ ( 1980 ) presented a number of spiral galaxies in which the distribution of neutral gas is lopsided , i.e. the gas extends further out on one side of the galaxy than on the other .",
    "in many systems asymmetries are also found to be well developed in the stellar disks as indeed confirmed recently by near - infrared observations ( zaritsky and rix , 1997 ) . rudnick and rix ( 1998 ) quantified the mean asymmetry of 54 early - type disk galaxies using the amplitude of the @xmath105 azimuthal fourier component of the @xmath33-band surface brightness .",
    "it was found that @xmath106 of all disk galaxies have azimuthal asymmetries in their stellar disk disribution , confirming lopsidedness as a dynamical phenomenon .",
    "based on the @xmath3-body simulations , we can offer a tentative hypothesis which accounts lopsided asymmetries in spiral galaxies by the @xmath105 jeans - unstable spiral mode .",
    "following athanassoula and sellwood ( 1986 ) , in figure 3 the time evolution of the fourier spectrum of the spiral pattern shown in figure 2 is plotted . only the azimuthal @xmath107 components are shown .",

    "the pitch angle of an @xmath111-armed logarithmic spiral @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 , and positive @xmath114 corresponds to trailing spirals and negative @xmath114 to leading ones .",
    "this logarithmic spiral fourier analysis shows that the peaks of the signals move to positive @xmath114 with increasing time , reach maxima at @xmath115 , and eventually decay .",
    "it follows , then , that after a time @xmath116 the model becomes practically stable with respect to gravitational jeans - type modes .",
    "we can observe that the @xmath117 modes are the most unstable ones .",
    "an interesting feature is that all these modes have roughly the same pitch angle .",
    "the amplitudes of the signals grow aperiodically , supporting the assumption that we have deal with the aperiodic jeans - type instability of gravity disturbances .    in actual galaxies ,",
    "discrete spiral modes were already found by rix and zaritsky ( 1995 ) , block and puerari ( 1999 ) and block _ et al . _",
    "it was stated that in the near - infrared , the morphology of older star - dominated disk indicates a simple classification scheme : the dominant fourier @xmath111-mode in the dust penetrated regime , and the associated pitch angle . a ubiquity of low @xmath105 and @xmath118 modes was confirmed .",

    ", the velocity diffusion coefficient for nonresonant stars @xmath325 is independent of @xmath171 ( to lowest order ) .",
    "this is a qualitative result of the nonresonant character of the star s interaction with collective aggregates .    by introducing @xmath326 and @xmath327 ( alexandrov _ et al .",

    "( 27 ) and ( 28 ) are rewritten as follows : @xmath328 which has the solution @xmath329 ( we have taken into account the observations that the distribution of newly born stars is close to the @xmath330-function distribution , @xmath331 ; grivnev and fridman , 1990 . )",
    "two general physical conclusions can be deduced from the solution ( 30 ) .",
    "first , during the development of the jeans instability , @xmath332 , the schwarzschild distribution of random velocities ( a gaussian spread along @xmath333 coordinates in velocity space ) is established .",
    "it sharp contrast to a normal gas with frequent interparticle collisions , it is the collisionless collective - type interactions between the stars which transform an arbitrary initial distribution into the maxwellian - like form . secondly , the energy of the oscillation field latexmath:[$\\propto \\sum_{\\bf k }    in the nonresonant - particle distribution . as the perturbation energy increases , the initially monoenergetic distribution spreads ( @xmath75 becomes less peaked ) , and the effective temperature ( or @xmath141 ) grows with time ( a gaussian spread increases ) : @xmath335 .",
    "that is , during the development of the jeans instability the planar mean - square velocity increases linearly with time . in section 4.2 of the present paper , we verify the @xmath336 dependence by @xmath3-body simulations .    from the above , this nonlinear wave",
    " star interaction increases the velocity dispersion of stars in milky way s disk after they are born ( and of particles in jeans - unstable @xmath3-body models ) .",
    "subsequently , sufficient velocity dispersion prevents jeans instability from occuring .",
    "the  diffusion \" of nonresonant stars takes place because they gain mechanical ( oscillatory ) energy as the instability develops .",
    "the velocity diffusion , however , presumably tapers off as jeans stability is approached : the radial velocity dispersion @xmath35 becomes greater than the critical one @xmath337 .",
    "this is large enough to turn off the jeans instability in a stellar disk .",
    "thus , the true time scale for relaxation in the milky way may be much shorter than its standard value @xmath317 yr for the classical chandrasekhar ",
    "ogorodnikov collisional relaxation ; it may be of the order @xmath338 yr , i.e. comparable with @xmath53 periods of the milky way rotation in the solar vicinity .",
    "the above relaxation time is in fair agreement with both observations and @xmath3-body simulations of milky way s disk ( binney and tremaine , 1987 , p. 478 ; grivnev and fridman , 1990 ; hohl , 1971 ) .",
    "the results show that a velocity dispersion given by toomre s ( 1964 ) criterion will stabilize a disk only against axisymmetric ring - like gravity perturbations . however , such disks are unstable against nonaxisymmetric spiral - like perturbations . jeans - unstable spiral perturbations  heat \" the system ; the mean - square random velocity increases linearly with time .",
    "the results are in agreement with analytical predictions .",
    "we were able to generate an axisymmetric , gravitationally stable disk .",
    "the initial condition for the axisymmetric stable disk was obtained analytically and confirmed experimentally : the radial dispersion of random velocities of stars should be equal ( or greater than ) to the modified dispersion at each radii .",
