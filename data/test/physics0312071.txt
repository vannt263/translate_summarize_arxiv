    "variational principles have a long and distinguished history in physics . apart from global formulations of physical principles , equivalent to local differential equations , they also are useful to approximate problems too difficult for analytic solutions . in the past century",
    "quantum variational calculations have been ubiquitous as an approximate method for the ground state of many difficult systems @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been some progress in using classical variational principles ( action principles ) to approximate the motion of classical systems such as classical molecules .",
    "we review recent developments in this area of classical mechanics , although we also overlap with quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular we shall also discuss the use of the quantum variational principle for excited states , and the connection to classical action principles .    in classical mechanics ,",
    "variational principles are often called least action principles , because the quantity subject to variations is traditionally the action . to confuse matters",
    "there are two classical actions , corresponding to two main action principles , which are called respectively , hamilton s action @xmath0 and maupertuis action @xmath1 ; these differ from each other ( they are related by a legendre transformation ) , and the notation @xmath2 is not universal ( we follow current usage but in fact some authors use the same symbols reversed @xcite ) .",
    "both actions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , have the same dimensions ( i.e. energy@xmath5time , or angular momentum ) .",
    "maupertuis least action principle is the older of the two ( 1744 ) by about a century , and as we shall discuss , it is inconveniently formulated in all textbooks @xcite . for clear statements of these old action principles , see the textbooks by arnold @xcite , goldstein et al @xcite , and sommerfeld @xcite .",
    "we shall review these action principles in the next section .",
    "some mathematics and notation required to deal with variational problems are summarized in appendix i. the distinguishing feature of variational problems is their character @xcite .",
    "one is searching for the which gives a minimum ( or stationary value ) to an integral , as opposed to extrema , where one is searching for the value of the variable which minimizes ( or makes stationary ) a function .",
    "of course this dichotomy is not so sharp in practice , as the global problem is equivalent to a differential equation ( the euler - lagrange equation ) which is of course local .",
    "the relation has even found its way into modern parlance @xcite : `` think globally , act locally ! '' .    in quantum mechanics , where ( usually ) the aim is for approximations to the energy by choosing a wave - function , one speaks of wave - functions , which are optimized according to a variational principle . in classical action principles ,",
    "the equivalent notion is that of a or trajectory , which should be optimized in accordance with the action principle . for uniformity we shall talk of in the classical domain , to emphasize the similarity of these ideas .",
    "as noted above , maupertuis action principle was formulated in precise form first by euler and lagrange some two and a half centuries ago ; for the history , see the books by yourgrau and mandelstam and by terral @xcite .",
    "however , even the formulation of these eminent mathematicians remained problematic , as emphasized by jacobi , who stated in his lectures on dynamics : `` in almost all text - books , even the best , this principle is presented so that it is impossible to understand '' @xcite .",
    "to understand at least in part the problem ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , it is sufficient to note that maupertuis principle assumes conservation of energy , whereas a well formulated principle , like hamilton s principle , implies energy conservation . as we shall see , it is possible to reformulate maupertuis principle in a more general form to remedy this problem and also make it more useful in applications @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that hamilton s principle does not suffer from any such drawbacks and is useful both conceptually ( to derive equations of motion ) and as a tool for approximations .",
    "the reformulated maupertuis principle has the advantage of being closely related to the classical limit of schrdinger s variational principle of wave mechanics , and thereby lends itself easily to semiclassical applications .",
    "even though we emphasize two action principles for classical mechanics , it is worth noting that there are many other formulations and reformulations of these principles . for a list of references on this point see ref.@xcite .",
    "we note in particular the elegant work of percival in the 1970 s on variational principles for invariant tori ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the emphasis on maupertuis and hamilton reflects the two main approaches of mechanics , one based on the lagrangian @xmath6 and the other based on the hamiltonian @xmath7 .    in the above and in section 2 we use the traditional terminology for the variational principles , i.e. `` least '' action principles , but , since jacobi s work it has been recognized @xcite that the action is in fact in general for the true trajectories .",
    "this means the first - order variation vanishes , and the action may be a minimum , a maximum or a saddle , depending on the second - order variation @xcite . hence `` stationary '' action principles would be more accurate terminology .",
    "similar remarks apply to the general maupertuis and reciprocal variational principles discussed in section 2 .    in sections 2 - 4",
    "we restrict ourselves to conservative holonomic systems .",
    "various problems are solved using classical and semiclassical variational methods and some comparisons are made with the results from the quantum variational method for excited states @xcite . in section 5",
    "we discuss nonconservative ( but nondissipative ) systems , and in section 6 we mention briefly particular nonholonomic systems ( which have velocity constraints ) , in connection with relativistic systems .",
    "the relations between classical and quantum variational principles ( vp s ) are discussed in section 7 .",
    "hamilton s least action principle ( hp ) states that , for a true trajectory of a system , hamilton s action @xmath3 is stationary for trajectories which run from the fixed initial space - time point @xmath8 to the fixed final space - time point @xmath9 ,    @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the duration . here",
    "the ( hamilton ) action @xmath3 is the time integral of the lagrangian @xmath12 from the initial point to the final point on the trial trajectory @xmath13 ,    @xmath14 where @xmath13 is the generalized coordinate , @xmath15 the generalized velocity and @xmath16 the time . in practice",
    "we choose @xmath17 and @xmath18 for convenience .",
    "in general @xmath19 stands for the complete set of independent generalized coordinates @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 the latter convention for the end - positions is also followed below in ( 2.2 ) , ( 2.3 ) , etc . from the action principle ( 2.1 ) one can derive lagrange s equation(s ) for the trajectory , which we shall not do in this review ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the reformulated ( or general ) maupertuis least action principle ( gmp ) states that , for a true trajectory maupertuis action @xmath4 is stationary on trajectories with fixed end - positions @xmath23 and @xmath24 and fixed mean energy @xmath25 :    @xmath26 here maupertuis action @xmath4 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the canonical momentum , and in general @xmath29 stands for @xmath30 .",
    "the second form for @xmath4 is valid for normal systems , for which @xmath31 and @xmath32 is quadratic in the @xmath33 s , where @xmath32 is the kinetic energy and @xmath34 the potential energy .",
    "the mean energy @xmath25 is the time average of the hamiltonian @xmath35 over the trial trajectory of duration @xmath36 , @xmath37 from the initial position @xmath23 to the final position @xmath24 which are common to all trial trajectories .",
    "@xmath38 we use the notation @xmath25 rather than @xmath39 because in the early sections we restrict @xcite ourselves to dynamical variables where the hamiltonian is equal to the energy @xmath40 ; the general case is discussed in note @xcite and later sections .",
    "the reciprocal maupertuis principle ( rmp ) , or principle of least ( stationary ) mean energy , is @xmath41    for stationary ( i.e. steady - state or bound ) motions ( periodic , quasiperiodic , chaotic ) ( 2.3 ) is the classical limit @xcite of the schrdinger variational principle of quantum mechanics : @xmath42 , ( see also sec.7 ) .",
    "the connection is clear intuitively : for bound motions , in the large quantum number limit the expectation value of the hamiltonian becomes the classical mean energy and the quantum number @xmath43 becomes proportional to the classical action @xmath4 over the motion .",
    "this connection enables the rmp to lend itself naturally to semiclassical applications ( sec .",
    "2.3 ) . for periodic and quasiperiodic motions the reciprocal maupertuis principle ( 2.3 )",
    "is equivalent @xcite to percival s principle for invariant tori @xcite .",
    "the rmp is , however , more general and is valid for chaotic motions , scattering orbits , arbitrary segments of trajectories , etc .",
    "percival s principle has been derived by klein and co - workers from matrix mechanics @xcite in the classical limit .",
    "hamilton s principle also has a reciprocal version @xcite - see next section . for a summary of reciprocity in variational calculus ,",
    "see appendix i.    the textbook euler - lagrange version of maupertuis principle differs from ( 2.2 ) ; the constraint of fixed mean energy @xmath25 is replaced by one of fixed energy @xmath44 , @xmath45    this is not erroneous , since a true trajectory does indeed conserve energy , but it is the source of the inconveniences referred to by jacobi @xcite . because , as we show in the next section , the gmp is equivalent to the hp , and therefore to the equations of motion from which energy conservation follows , it will become clear that energy conservation is a consequence of the gmp ( 2.2 ) , rather than an assumption as in the original mp ( 2.4 ) .",
    "it is well known that conservation of energy is a consequence of symmetry under time translation ( noether s theorem ) , either via the lagrangian and equations of motion @xcite , or from the action and hamilton s principle @xcite .",
    "similarly energy conservation can be derived directly from the gmp @xcite .    in the early sections we assume @xmath31 and that @xmath34 is time - independent ( conservative ) . later these restrictions are relaxed ( see sections 5 and 6 ) .",
    "within mechanics one can show that different action principles such as ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) are equivalent to each other .",
    "this we sketch below ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "alternatively , one can show @xcite from hamilton s principle ( 2.1 ) that the lagrange equations of motion , in some coordinates are essentially newton s equations in the same set of coordinates .",
    "reference @xcite shows that ( 2.4 ) is equivalent to newton s equations , quoting an argument due to lagrange , and in @xcite we derive ( 2.3 ) from similar arguments . on a more lofty level",
    "one can derive the action principles from quantum mechanics in the classical limit .",
    "dirac and feynman @xcite have derived hamilton s principle from a path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , and similarly the rmp ( 2.3 ) can be derived from wave mechanics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further connections between quantum and classical variational principles are given in sec .",
    "the equivalence of hamilton s principle ( 2.1 ) with the general maupertuis principle ( 2.2 ) is worth spelling out in a little more detail .",
    "( the equivalence of the mp with the gmp is discussed in appendix ii ) .",
    "the starting point of the derivation is the legendre transformation between the lagrangian of the system and the corresponding hamiltonian ,    @xmath46 here @xmath47 runs over the various degrees of freedom , and @xmath19 stands for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 . upon integration over time along a trial trajectory starting at @xmath51 and ending at @xmath52 ( where we could have @xmath53 for a closed trajectory ) , and with the definitions given above we obtain    @xmath54 where @xmath36 is the duration along the trial trajectory .",
    "thus @xmath4 and @xmath3 are also related by a legendre transformation .",
    "if we now vary the trial trajectory and the duration @xmath36 , keeping @xmath23 and @xmath24 fixed , and compute the variation of the different terms in ( 2.6 ) , we obtain    @xmath55    which is the relation between the different variations . for conservative systems ,",
    "near a true trajectory hamilton s principle is equivalent to the vanishing of the left hand side . in fact",
    "a vanishing left hand side is the unconstrained form @xcite of hamilton s principle ( the uhp - see @xcite for proof ) : @xmath56 where we have used the fact @xmath57 a true trajectory for conservative systems .",
    "eq ( 2.8 ) has the unconstrained form @xmath58 , with @xmath59 ( the energy of the true trajectory ) a constant lagrange multiplier . for fixed @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath60 )",
    ", we recover the hp @xmath61 , and for fixed @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath62 ) we obtain the reciprocal hamilton principle ( rhp )    @xmath63    the rhp ( principle of least time ) is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the right hand side of ( 2.7 ) ( which therefore must also vanish near a true trajectory ) gives the unconstrained form of maupertuis principle ( ump ) for conservative systems : @xmath64    this has the unconstrained form @xmath65 , with @xmath66 ( the duration of the true trajectory ) a constant lagrange multiplier .",
    "for fixed @xmath67 ( 2.10 ) gives the gmp of equation ( 2.2 ) while for fixed @xmath4 it gives the reciprocal , the rmp of equation ( 2.3 ) .",
    "an alternative derivation of the ump ( 2.10 ) is given in ref.@xcite with traditional variational procedures , employing the general first variation theorem of variational calculus , which includes end - point variations @xcite .",
    "equation ( 2.7 ) connecting the different variations is reminiscent of equations of thermodynamics , where two conditions are derived from a single equation .",
    "there are many other analogies with thermodynamics , e.g. two actions in mechanics analogous to two free energies in thermodynamics , with a legendre transform relation in each case @xcite , adiabatic processes and reversible processes in both mechanics and thermodynamics , and reciprocal variational principles in both mechanics and thermodynamics ( see appendix i ) .",
    "beginning with helmholtz @xcite , many of these analogies have been explored by various authors @xcite .",
    "as we have stressed , we hold the end - positions @xmath23 and @xmath24 fixed in all the variational principles discussed above .",
    "it is possible to relax these constraints by generalizing further the uhp and ump ( see notes @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , but we shall not need these generalizations for the applications we discuss .",
    "the derivation we have sketched shows that the four principles ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.2 ) , ( 2.3 ) , ( 2.9 ) are equivalent to each other .",
    "mathematically , the hamilton principles can be regarded as legendre transformations of the maupertuis principles , since the legendre transformation relation @xmath68 allows us to change independent variables from @xmath69 to @xmath36 .",
    "thus in classical mechanics we have a set of four variational principles that are symmetric under legendre and reciprocal transformations :    @xmath70 + after a short interlude on action principles in semiclassical mechanics we proceed to discuss some simple examples .",
    "the rmp ( 2.3 ) is the basis of a very simple semiclassical quantization method .",
    "as we shall see , the solution of ( 2.3 ) yields , for the true trajectory or approximations to it , @xmath25 as a function of the action @xmath4 , @xmath71 . for bound motions",
    "we then assume the standard einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) @xcite quantization rule for the action over a cycle @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is essentially the morse - maslov index ( e.g. @xmath75 for a harmonic oscillator ) , and @xmath76 is planck s constant .",
    "( ebk ( or torus ) quantization is the generalization of bohr - sommerfeld - wilson quantization from separable to arbitrary integrable systems ) .",
    "thus we have expressed @xmath25 as a function of the quantum number @xmath43 , @xmath77 . for multidimensional systems , ( 2.11 )",
    "is applied to each action @xmath78 in @xmath79 , so that we get @xmath80 as a function of the quantum numbers @xmath81 .",
    "this method has been found to be reasonably accurate even for nonintegrable systems , where strictly speaking the good actions @xmath78 do not exist .",
    "the ump ( 2.10 ) can also be used to obtain semiclassical expressions for @xmath80 .",
    "examples are given later in sections 4.1 - 4.3 .",
    "here we discuss how to use variational principles to solve practical problems .",
    "we use the so - called direct method @xcite of the calculus of variations ( e.g. rayleigh - ritz ) , which operates directly with the variational principle and makes no use of the associated euler - lagrange differential equation .",
    "historically @xcite , the method originates with euler , hamilton , rayleigh , ritz and others ( see @xcite for some early references).we assume a trial solution , which contains one or more adjustable parameters @xmath82 .",
    "we then use the variational principle to optimize the choice of the @xmath82 . generally speaking ,",
    "the more parameters @xmath82 , the better the solution .",
    "the direct method is well known in quantum mechanics , but is also very useful in classical mechanics , as we shall see .",
    "we give a few simple examples in this section , mainly for bound motions ; further simple examples , including for scattering problems , are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the references therein .",
    "the simplest example is the free motion of a particle of unit mass on the line segment @xmath83 to @xmath84 . with the traditional maupertuis principle",
    "( 2.4 ) once we fix the energy @xmath85 there is essentially nothing left to vary . with the gmp ( 2.2 ) or its reciprocal ( 2.3 ) we can choose a variety of trial trajectories . for example we can take velocity @xmath86 on the sub - segment @xmath87 and velocity @xmath88 on the sub - segment @xmath89 .",
    "the action @xmath4 is @xmath90 and the mean energy @xmath25 is @xmath91 , where we can vary @xmath86 to change @xmath4 while keeping the mean energy fixed .",
    "we then find that @xmath92 , a simple example of energy conservation for this particular trial trajectory . by iteration",
    "we can now see that energy is conserved for the whole trajectory on the segment @xmath93 , as a consequence of the general maupertuis principle ( 2.2 ) .",
    "an instructive example is the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quartic oscillator , with hamiltonian    @xmath94 using a harmonic oscillator trial trajectory with @xmath95 we find for a complete cycle with period @xmath96    @xmath97    @xmath98    from ( 3.3 ) , with the use of the rmp ( 2.3 ) we can obtain the ",

    "systematic improvements can be obtained by including terms @xmath104 , @xmath105 , etc .",
    ", in the trial trajectory @xmath106 ; see @xcite for a related example .",
    "we have used the rmp @xmath107 here since ( 3.3 ) made it very convenient to do so .",
    "the gmp @xmath108 and the hp are also viable for this problem , but the original mp @xmath109 is not , since the constraint of fixed @xmath44 leaves essentially no freedom for variation for 1d problems @xcite .",
    "one can get around this by relaxing the constraint via a lagrange multiplier , but this is then equivalent to the gmp ( see app .",
    "ii ) or the ump . in 2d",
    "etc . , the constraint of fixed @xmath44 does allow some freedom for variation , but the constraint is very cumbersome and the gmp is always much more convenient .    the use of the action principle ( 2.3 ) to obtain the mean energy as a function of the action ( 3.4 ) or the period as a function of mean energy ( 3.5 ) , with harmonic oscillator trial trajectories , is very similar to the use of the variational principle in quantum mechanics to estimate the energies of states of the quartic oscillator with harmonic oscillator trial wave - functions .",
    "we show this explicitly for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( 3.1 ) . in both cases",
    "an optimum frequency for the trial harmonic case is sought and the final errors are also similar .",
    "we start by computing the quantum expectation value of ( 3.1 ) using a harmonic oscillator state with trial frequency @xmath110 , @xmath111 and find the optimum frequency @xmath99 by demanding the vanishing of the derivative of @xmath112 with respect to the frequency .",
    "we substitute this frequency in ( 3.6 ) to estimate the energy of excited states    @xmath113    taking the asymptotic limit of ( 3.7 ) for @xmath114 and replacing @xmath115 by @xmath4 we obtain the second equation ( 3.4 ) .",
    "this is not as trivial as it seems , since ( 3.7 ) was obtained from the quantum variational principle ( for an arbitrary state @xcite ) , while ( 3.4 ) was obtained from a classical action principle .",
    "this example illustrates neatly that the two variational principles are related : the reciprocal maupertuis principle is the classical limit of the schrdinger variational principle ( see sec.7 for further discussion ) .",
    "the example illustrates also that the classical action principle can be used as a method of approximation , and semiclassically to estimate @xmath116 as described in sec.2.3 . according to ( 2.11 ) , we quantize @xmath117 in ( 3.4 ) semiclassically by the replacement @xmath118 ; as just discussed , this leads to agreement asymptotically ( @xmath119 ) with the quantum result ( 3.7 ) .",
    "reference @xcite discusses the similar relation between quantum and classical variations for a different one - dimensional system , with a linear potential .",
    "the application of classical action principles to other simple systems is discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "the application of quantum variations for excited states has a long history : the earliest reference is mcweeny and coulson , who applied it to the quartic oscillator described above @xcite more than fifty years ago ( for later references see @xcite ) .      for a pendulum with two degrees of freedom ( @xmath120 )",

    ", we introduce the cylindrical coordinate @xmath127 , and the angular momentum component @xmath128 , which is a constant of the motion .",
    "we also expand @xmath129 , keeping up to quartic terms , which are @xmath130 .",
