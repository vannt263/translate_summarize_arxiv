    "graphene@xcite possesses a very long mean free path of the order of micrometers and a ballistic transport regime at low temperatures@xcite , which combined with a low spin - orbit coupling make it ideal for applications in spintronic devices .",
    "however , due to the intrinsic spin - unpolarized electronic structure of a pristine sheet , it is necessary to modify the electronic structure of graphene in such a way that the transport properties of the two spin channels become different .",
    "few ways that have been proposed to do this are ( i ) quantum confinement ( _ e .",
    "graphene nanoribbons@xcite , nanoflakes@xcite , hidrogenation@xcite , and interaction with substrates@xcite ) ; ii ) strain@xcite ; and iii ) adsorption of molecules or atoms@xcite , where the presence of a local magnetic moment leads to a spin - non - degenerated electronic structure",
    ". however , edge disorder is a limiting factor to use quantum confinement as a way to differentiate the spin channels , and for the application of strain , there is the drawback of a mechanically controllable device .",
    "therefore , doping large - area graphene with magnetic dopants seems more suitable for applications in spintronics .    in the last few years , motivated by spintronic applications , many studies focused on understanding the doping properties of metallic adatoms on graphene .",
    "experimentally , it has been shown that both noble metals and transition metals tend to diffuse and clusterize in pristine graphene , unless they are trapped in lattice defects such as monovacancies ( mvs ) and divacancies ( dvs).@xcite moreover , all theoretical studies of metallic doping in large - area graphene have focused solely in investigating the emergence of local magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "however , conclusions about the possibility of using metallic doping to generate spin - polarized transport requires the investigation of spin - resolved currents , instead of merely local magnetic moments .",

    "we study the adsorption both in pristine graphene as well as in monovacancies and divacancies , and we show that the current polarization is not monotonically correlated to the local magnetic moment .",
    "instead , it depends on the presence of localized levels near the fermi energy which strongly couple ( and thus hybridize ) to the graphene @xmath8 bands .",
    "we also show that a gate potential can be used to tune the energy of these localized levels , leading to an external way to control the degree of spin - polarized current without the application of a magnetic field .    in fig .",

    "all geometries were fully relaxed using a force criteria of @xmath16ev /    with the siesta code@xcite .",
    "all calculations were carried out applying the generalized gradient approximation as parameterized by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof@xcite ( gga - pbe ) for the exchange correlation functional ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we do not consider the spin - orbit coupling , because such interaction may locally open small band gaps@xcite , of the order of few milli electron volts , which will be a small effect when compared to the single - impurity scattering effects investigated in this paper . a localized double-@xmath18 polarized basis , an electronic temperature of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for the grid cut - off were used .",
    "most of our results were obtained with a rectangular @xmath21 graphene supercell , as schematically shown in fig . [ fig2](a ) .",
    "the integration in the brillouin zone was done with the monkhorst - pack@xcite scheme corresponding to a @xmath22 sampling in the unitary cell .",
    "a vacuum of @xmath23   was used between the periodic images of graphene sheets to avoid undesirable interactions .",
    "the directions between the symmetry points defined in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) were used to plot the energy bands .",
    "once the relaxed geometries were obtained , we calculated the transport properties with the transampa code @xcite .",
    "this code makes use of the non equilibrium green s function techniques coupled to dft in a fully self - consistent way with the bttiker - landauer formalism@xcite within the non interacting approach of meir wingreen@xcite . within this formalism",
    ", the translational symmetry along the transport direction is broken . however , in the transversal direction , due to the periodicity of the infinite 2d - system , the bloch theorem is still usable . in order to take into account a truly 2d graphene sheet ,",
    "we implement the transport equations with transversal periodicity , considering @xmath24-points perpendicular to the transport direction ( @xmath25 ) . in the transport calculations ,",
    "the relaxed geometries were sandwiched between two buffer layers to guarantee that the scattering region has a pristine - like coupling with the leads .",
    "we used the same simulation parameters of the siesta calculations , with exception of the @xmath24-points sampling . here , for the electronic density , we used the equivalent of 48 @xmath25-points in the unitary cell , whereas for the transmittance , 5000 @xmath25-points are necessary for a smooth behavior .",
    "this number of @xmath24-points is sufficient to capture the true 2d - character of graphene . in each step of the self - consistent field cycle",
    ", we calculated the electronic density with an integral in the complex plane discretized in 60 energy points and 5 poles .",
    "when a bias potential was applied , the non equilibrium contribution for the electronic density was calculated with an integral discretized in 200 energy points .",
    "we also implement the effect of a gate potential with strength `` @xmath26 '' by adding to the hamiltonian a function @xmath27 that depends only on the @xmath28 coordinate , given by :    @xmath29 \\right\\ } & , 0<z - z_{1}<\\tau \\\\",

    "the @xmath32 parameter controls the smoothness of the connections between the gated and non - gated regions , and we used @xmath33   for a smooth behavior .",
    "it is also important to mention that the gate effect is included in the whole self - consistent - field procedure , and the electronic density rearrangement creates a screening effect , in the sense that ( for example ) @xmath34 will not necessarily shift the energy levels by @xmath35 .",

    "a bias potential of @xmath50 was used .",
    "clearly , @xmath6 and @xmath5 adsorbed on pristine graphene generate the higher cp in the systems we consider . however , the metal diffusion experimentally observed creates a drawback to build devices with adatoms over pristine graphene since in the most cases the atoms tend to clusterize .",
    "for the atoms trapped in defects , the higher values of cp ( in modulus ) occurs for the @xmath12 , followed by @xmath10 .",
    "the last one has a negative cp because localized levels above the fermi - energy scatter majority spins , generating a current with excess of minority spin electrons .",
    "one should note that , despite the high magnetization of all @xmath4 complexes , the absolute values of cp are not so remarkable in such systems .",
    "in particular , the @xmath51 has a negligible cp , even though it has @xmath52 .",
    "for the noble metals , an unusual local magnetic moment generated by the polarization of `` @xmath53 '' atomic orbitals leads to cp smaller than @xmath54 .",

    "[ fig4 ] . in panel",
    "( a ) we plot the energy bands for the @xmath55 complex . in this situation",
    ", there is a flat band around @xmath57 below the fermi energy , with majority spin associated with au `` s '' atomic orbitals , which is responsible for the local magnetic moment of @xmath58 .",
    "this band does not modify the shape of the dirac cone because it has a weak coupling to the graphene @xmath8 bands . as a consequence , the transmission probability [ @xmath59 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) is very similar to the pristine case around the fermi energy .",
    "this example shows that a magnetic moment and localized states near the fermi energy are a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition to generate spin - polarized currents in graphene , as discussed above .",
    "in fact , to generate current polarizations it is also necessary to have a high coupling between the localized levels and graphene @xmath8 bands , modifying in this way the transmission probability for only one or both spin channels . as an example of modifications in only one spin channel , we show the energy bands for the @xmath6 adsorbed on pristine graphene in fig . [ fig4 ] ( c ) .",
    "it is notable that a dirac cone is well defined only for the majority spin . for the minority spin ,",
    "localized levels hybridize with the dirac cone states , and hence significantly modify the dispersion of these states . as a result , the transmittance [ shown in fig . [ fig4 ]",
    "( d ) ] is very similar to the one in pristine graphene only for the majority spin , causing in this way a high current polarization . for the @xmath12 complex",
    "there are modifications in the band structure for both spin channels [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( e ) ] . in this case , the local magnetic moment comes from localized states around the fermi energy with a high hybridization with the dirac cone . as a consequence , the transmittance for both spin channels , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( f ) , are not only distinct from the pristine case , but also very different between them . in this system",
    "we still observe a flat band at @xmath60 above the fermi energy .",
    "however , as there is a weak coupling with the dirac cone states , there is almost no change in @xmath61 .",

    "( a ) we present the spin - resolved currents . without a gate potential",
    "the current polarization is negligible .",
    "however , with the inclusion of a negative gate the current has excess of majority spin electrons , whereas with a positive gate there are excess of minority spin electrons .",
    "this behavior occurs because the gate potential shifts the localized states that hybridize with the graphene @xmath8 bands , as shown in figs .",

    "[ fig6](g ) , we also present cp as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "it is remarkable that cp can be changed from @xmath69 to @xmath70 with the application of a gate .",

    "in conclusion , via studies of adsorbed metal atoms in graphene with and without defects , we show that the presence of a local magnetic moment is a necessary but not sufficient condition to create a current polarization .",
    "essentially , a fundamental requirement to have a non - zero current polarization is the presence of spin - split localized levels near the fermi energy that strongly hybridize with the graphene dirac - cone states .",
    "we also show that with an external gate potential it is possible to control the degree of current polarization without any magnetic perturbation .",
    "the knowledge of such properties for isolated scatterers is a fundamental first step to design spintronic devices , where other important effects such as multiple scattering and disorder may even enhance the polarization signal@xcite .",

    "<S> an essential requirement is the presence of spin - split localized levels near the fermi energy that strongly hybridize with the graphene @xmath8 bands . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that a gate potential can be used to tune the energy of these localized levels , leading to an external way to control the degree of spin - polarized current without the application of a magnetic field . </S>"
