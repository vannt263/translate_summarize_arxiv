    "in time - reversal experiments a signal emitted by a localized source is recorded at an array of transducers .",
    "it is then re - emitted into the medium reversed in time , that is , the part of the signal that is recorded first is sent back last . because of the time - reversibility of the wave equation the back - propagated signal refocuses approximately at the location of the original source because the array is limited in size .",
    "a striking experimental observation is that the presence of inhomogeneities in the medium improves the refocusing resolution .",
    "the explanation for this super - resolution is multipathing : waves in complex media that are captured by the recording array have undergone multiple scattering making it effectively larger than its physical size .",
    "another important feature of super - resolution in time reversal is that the refocused signal does not depend on the realization of the random medium .",
    "that is , the refocused signal is deterministic .",
    "super - resolution and self - averaging of refocused signals in complicated media has been observed both in laboratory experiments ( see reviews @xcite and references therein ) and in underwater acoustic wave propagation over long distances ( tens of kilometers ) @xcite .",
    "time - reversal techniques have numerous applications ranging from medicine to communications and , more recently , imaging in random media @xcite .",
    "the first mathematical analysis of time - reversal in random media was given by clouet and fouque @xcite , who analyzed refocusing and self - averaging of time - reversed pulses in a one - dimensional layered random medium .",
    "their result was extended to a three - dimensional layered medium in @xcite .",
    "super - resolution in spatial refocusing and its statistical stability for multi - dimensional waves in random media was analyzed in @xcite , in a remote - sensing regime where the paraxial or parabolic wave equation can be used .",
    "the refocusing of the average signal in a full three - dimensional medium , in the regimes of random geometrical optics and radiative transfer ( transport ) , was studied in @xcite .",
    "we also mention that another source of multipathing is the mixing of waves by the boundaries in an ergodic cavity .",
    "this has been studied experimentally in @xcite and mathematically in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze time reversal in the radiative transfer regime using the parabolic wave equation , when the waves interact fully with the random inhomogeneities .",
    "we prove mathematically that the refocused signal is self - averaging , which means that it does not depend on the realization of the random medium .",
    "the mathematical quantitiy that we analyze is the wigner measure of a pair of oscillatory solutions of the random schrdinger equation . in the present setting",
    ", the random potential depends in a markovian way on the variable @xmath1 , the main direction of propagation of the waves .",
    "this allowed us to use in @xcite a martingale method to prove that the average of the wigner distribution converges to a solution of the radiative transfer equation . in this paper",
    "we use additional regularity of the wigner measure , available in time - reversal when there is some blurring at the recording array , to show that the whole wigner distribution , and not only its average , converges weakly , as a schwartz distribution and in probability , to the deterministic solution of the transport equation .",
    "the blurring at the recording array provides a priori bounds for the wigner transform in @xmath0 .",
    "these bounds and the markovianity of the random potential in the direction of propagation make the time - reversal problem more tractable mathematically and allow us to prove in a fairly simple and straightforward manner self - averaging of the time - reversed signal .",
    "we recall that the wigner transform is a convenient tool to analyze high frequency wave propagation in deterministic @xcite and random media @xcite",
    ". introduced by wigner in 1932 @xcite , it has been used extensively in the mathematical literature recently . convergence of the average wigner distribution to the solution of the radiative transfer equation was first proved by h. spohn in @xcite for time - independent potentials on small time intervals .",
    "this result was extended to global in time convergence by l. erds and h .-",
    "yau @xcite .",
    "these proofs involve infinite neumann ( diagrammatic ) expansions for the solution of the schrdinger equation and are quite involved technically .",
    "the corresponding problem with time - dependent potentials is much simpler mathematically .",
    "it was treated by us in @xcite in the markovian case , and by f. poupaud and a. vasseur @xcite in the case of finite - range time correlations . in this paper",
    "we use the fact that the wigner family arising in time - reversal problems is more regular than the usual one because blurring is added at the recording array .",
    "this provides some additional regularity usually obtained by considering mixtures of states as , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we describe the scaling and obtain an expression for the back - propagated signal in terms of the wigner transform in section [ sec : signal ] . the main result and assumptions on the random medium",
    "are formulated in section [ sec : mainresult ] .",
    "the proofs are presented in section [ sec : wigner ] .",

    "the pressure field @xmath2 satisfies the scalar wave equation @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the local wave speed that we will assume to be random , and the laplacian operator includes both direction of propagation , @xmath1 , and the transverse variable @xmath5 . in the physical setting , we have @xmath6 .",
    "we consider dimensions @xmath7 to stress that our analysis is independent of the dimension .",
    "if we assume that at time @xmath8 , the wave field has a `` beam - like '' structure in the @xmath1 direction , and if back - scattering may be neglected , we can replace the wave equation by its parabolic approximation @xcite .",

    ", this means that the pressure field is kept unchanged and that the sign of its time derivative is reversed . in the parabolic approximation , this is equivalent to phase conjugation , where @xmath11 is replaced by its complex conjugate @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the recording array occupies a compact subset of the plane @xmath18 , and introduce a real - valued aperture function @xmath24 .",
    "it represents the restriction of the signal onto the array , and possible amplification by the array that may vary from one receiver to another . in the absence of amplification it is given by the characteristic function of an array set @xmath25 .",
    "we also allow for some blurring of the recorded signal , modeled by a convolution with kernel @xmath26 .",
    "the signal at @xmath27 after time reversal takes then the form @xmath28 the last step consists in letting the signal propagate back to the origin @xmath17 and time reversing it one more time @xmath29 the last step , phase - conjugating at the source , is not performed in real physical experiments but is convenient if we need to compare the back - propagated signal to the original signal .",
    "it affects neither the degree of refocusing nor the self - averaging effect .",
    "the back - propagated signal in time is given at the plane @xmath17 by @xmath30 we will be interested in the sequel in the refocusing and self - averaging properties of the back - propagated signal @xmath31 for each fixed frequency .",
    "self - averaging of the time signal @xmath32 then follows from ( [ eq : psib - time ] ) when @xmath33 has compact support in @xmath34 .",
    "an interesting conclusion of this paper is that the additional blurring by convolution with the kernel @xmath35 makes the signal @xmath31 self - averaging for every frequency @xmath34 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the situation studied in @xcite , where no blurring was introduced and self - averaging was observed only for the full time signal .",
    "we recall the formal passage from the reduced wave equation to the parabolic equation ( [ eq : sch ] ) described in the appendix to @xcite and explain how the radiative transfer scaling arises in this context .",
    "we start with the reduced wave equation @xmath36 and look for solutions of ( [ red - wave ] ) in the form @xmath37 then we obtain @xmath38 the refraction index @xmath39 is weakly fluctuating so that it has the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 models random fluctuations that will be described in detail in section [ sec : random - refr - ind ] . here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the correlation lengths of @xmath41 in the transverse and longitudinal directions , respectively , and the small parameter @xmath44 measures the strength of the fluctuation .",
    "the waves propagate over a distance @xmath45 in the @xmath14-plane and @xmath46 in the @xmath1-direction , and we rescale @xmath14 and @xmath1 accordingly .",
    "we also introduce a carrier wave number @xmath47 and replace @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the non - dimensional wave number ( we drop the prime below ) .",
    "the physical parameters determined by the medium are the length scales @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the non - dimensional parameter @xmath50 .",
    "we now explain the scaling of the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the radiative transfer regime .",

    "then ( [ red - param ] ) becomes after multiplication by @xmath58 @xmath59 observe that when @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the first term in ( [ red - param1 ] ) is small and may be neglected in the leading order since @xmath62",
    ". then ( [ red - param1 ] ) becomes @xmath63 which is the parabolic wave equation ( [ eq : sch ] ) in the radiative transfer scaling .",
    "the second condition in ( [ parab - assump ] ) implies that the carrier wave number should be chosen as @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath65 implies that @xmath66 . therefore the correlation length in the longitudinal direction @xmath1",
    "should be much longer than in the transverse plane @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , we should have @xmath67 which in turn implies that the fluctuation strength @xmath68 .",

    "the connection between the relations of the physical parameters and the resulting scaling of the parabolic approximation is further discussed in @xcite . the rigorous passage to the parabolic approximation in one dimension in a random medium in a similar scaling",
    "is discussed in @xcite .    to define what we mean",
    "by the quality of the refocused signal , we assume that the initial pulse is centered around a point @xmath71 with support comparable to the transverse correlation length .",
    "then the initial data for the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : sch - rescaled ] ) becomes in the rescaled variables @xmath72 the transducers should obviously be capable of capturing signals of frequency @xmath73 so that the blurring occurs on the scale of the source .",
    "we therefore replace @xmath26 by @xmath74 . finally , we are interested in the refocusing properties of @xmath75 in the vicinity of @xmath71 and consequently introduce the scaling @xmath76 .",
    "we then recast ( [ eq : psib ] ) as @xmath77 where @xmath78 we observe that @xmath79 , so that @xmath80    let us now introduce the auxiliary function @xmath81 as in @xcite , @xmath82 which satisfies the initial value problem @xmath83 it physically describes the component with wave vector @xmath84 that is sent back to the plane @xmath17 by the array .",
    "we then define the wigner transform as @xmath85 where @xmath86 the wigner transform @xmath87 is more regular than @xmath88 because of additional averaging in the wave vector @xmath84 .",
    "more , precisely , while the family @xmath88 is not uniformly bounded in @xmath0 , the family @xmath87 has a uniform bound in @xmath0 .",
    "this regularizing effect is essentially the same as the one obtained by considering mixtures of states for the schrdinger equation as in @xcite .",
    "we can then recast ( [ eq : psibeps2 ] ) as @xmath89 the above formula shows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath90 as @xmath91 is characterized by that of the wigner transform @xmath92 .",
    "this section presents our two main results .",
    "the first one describes the self - averaging of the back - propagated signal @xmath93 in ( [ eq : psibeps3 ] ) .",
    "its proof is based on the second theorem , of independent interest , which shows that the wigner transform converges in probability to a unique deterministic limit , solution of a transport equation .",

    "then for each @xmath99 the back - propagated signal @xmath100 given by ( [ eq : psibeps3 ] ) converges in probability and weakly in @xmath101 as @xmath102 to the deterministic function @xmath103 the function @xmath104 satisfies the transport equation @xmath105 with initial data @xmath106 and where the operator @xmath107 is defined by @xmath108 here @xmath109 is the fourier transform of the correlation function of @xmath41 , defined by ( [ eq : tilder ] ) below .",

    "first , it ensures that the back - propagated signal is essentially independent of the realization of the random medium in the high - frequency limit since @xmath117 is deterministic .",
    "second , it provides a quantitative description of the back - propagated field , which may be written as @xmath118 the kernel @xmath119 is the fourier transform in @xmath120 of the solution of ( [ eq : treqformal ] ) .",
    "we deduce from this formula that the back - propagated signal has much better refocusing properties in random media than in homogeneous media .",
    "as is explained in @xcite , the reason is that the limiting wigner measure @xmath121 is more regular in its @xmath122 variable when the right - hand side in ( [ eq : treqformal ] ) is present .",
