    "@xcite and magic  @xcite collaborations have reported the detection of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays  in the tev energy range from the direction of the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the nature of this source is still unknown .",
    "the main astrophysical explanations are based on particle acceleration in the region of the sgr  a  east supernova remnant  @xcite , in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole sgr  a@xmath4 located at the center of our galaxy  @xcite , or in a recently detected plerion  @xcite .",
    "another widely discussed possibility concerns @xmath0-ray  emission from annihilation of dark matter ( dm ) particles  @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations of hierarchical structure formation  @xcite predict that the dm  particles form large scale structures in the universe , and especially halos with a pronounced density cusp located at their center .",
    "galaxies are predicted to be embedded in such dm  halos .",
    "particle physics and cosmology experiments constrain some characteristics of the new particles  @xcite : the new particles should be massive ( @xmath5  some gev ) and have weak interactions with ordinary matter of the order of the electro - weak cross sections .",
    "extensions of the standard model of particle physics provide new particle candidates consistent with cosmological dm  and are of main interest to solve both issues .",
    "these models include supersymmetric theories ( e.g. mssm  @xcite or amsb@xcite ) or kaluza - klein ( kk ) scenarios with extra - dimensions  @xcite .",
    "+ all dm  particle candidates have some common properties that can be used to detect them indirectly , since their annihilation may give rise to @xmath0-rays , but also to neutrinos and cosmic - rays .",
    "their annihilation rate is proportional to the square density of dm .",
    "it is thus enhanced in the dense dm  regions at the center of dm  halos .",
    "cuspy halos may therefore provide detectable fluxes of vhe @xmath0-rays  ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the centers of galaxies are indeed good candidates for indirect dm  detection , the closest candidate being the center of the milky way .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  energy spectrum generated by dm  annihilation is characterized by a continuum ranging up to the mass of the dm  particle , and possibly faint @xmath0-ray  lines provided by two - body final states  @xcite .    for annihilation of dm  particles of mass @xmath6 accumulated in a spherical halo of mass density profile @xmath7 and particle density profile @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray  flux @xmath9 is proportional to the line - of - sight - integrated squared particle density , multiplied by the velocity - weighted annihilation cross section @xmath10 and the number of photons @xmath11 generated per annihilation event  @xcite .",

    "recent n - body simulations  @xcite suggest that @xmath20 could monotonically decrease to zero towards the gc .",
    "values of @xmath20 lower than @xmath21 lead to an angular distribution broader than the h.e.s.s .",

    "results on the gc  @xcite were based on 17  h of data recorded with the first two telescopes in 2003 . here , we report on results obtained with the full four - telescope array , using 48.7  h ( live time ) of data collected between march 30th and september 4th , 2004 .",
    "the full array provides higher detection rates than the 2003 data , as well as improved background rejection and angular resolution .",

    "an additional 15.2  h dataset was obtained from the galactic plane survey  @xcite , within @xmath25 of sgr  a*.    two different techniques for calibration and image analysis were applied  @xcite and give identical results .",
    "both methods provide a typical energy resolution of 15% and an angular resolution of @xmath26 above the analysis energy threshold .",
    "the results described in this paper are derived using the second technique .",

    "no indications of line emission are found .",
    "there is no significant variation in flux between 2003 and 2004 ; data are consistent with a constant flux  @xcite .",
    "searches for variability or flares on time scales down to 10  min did not show statistically significant deviations from the mean flux .",
    "we note that approximately 20  min of data are required for a @xmath47  standard deviation detection of the source above background .",
    "a flare lasting for 10  min ( 30  min , 3  h , respectively ) and with a 7-fold ( 4-fold , 2-fold , respectively ) increase over the quiescent flux would be detected at the 99%  cl .",

    "again , no statistically significant periodicity was found .",
    "however , if the vhe emission is associated with sgr  a@xmath4 and given its typical rate of x - ray flares of 1.2 per 24  h  @xcite , the 48.7  h of h.e.s.s .  data may simply not contain a flare event .",
    "the location of the tev @xmath0-ray  signal and its temporal stability are consistent with a dm  annihilation signal from a halo centered sgr  a@xmath4 .    in a first step",
    ", it is assumed that all @xmath0-rays  from hess  j1745 - 290 are due to dm  annihilations .",
    "the hypothetical dm  halo centered on sgr  a * was found in the previous section to be very cuspy , with a logarithmic slope @xmath20 higher than 1.2 .",
    "this value is consistent with the dm  halo shapes predicted by some structure formation simulations .",
    "the energy spectrum provides another crucial test concerning a possible dm  origin for the detected vhe emission .",
    "the extension of the spectrum beyond 10  tev requires masses of dm  particles which are uncomfortably large mssm .",
    "the annihilation spectra of phenomenological mssm  neutralinos depend on the gaugino / higgsino mixing , but all exhibit a curved spectrum , which in a @xmath49 representation rises for @xmath50 , plateaus at @xmath51 , and falls off approaching @xmath6 .",
    "amsb  models lead to similar spectra .",
    "such a spectral shape is inconsistent with the measured power - law as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : edis ] .",
    "h.e.s.s .  data from 2003 , with restricted energy range and lower statistics , were still marginally consistent with dm  spectra  @xcite , but it appears impossible to generate a power - law extending over two decades from the quark and gluon fragmentation spectra of neutralino decays , also considering radiative effects  @xcite . as an alternative scenario , mixed @xmath39 , @xmath40 final states have been proposed  @xcite , with dm  masses in the @xmath52  tev range , generating a flatter spectrum .",
    "non - minimal susy models can be constructed which allow such decay branching ratios , combined with neutralino masses of tens of tev .",
    "kk  dm  discussed in  @xcite also give harder spectra .",
    "pythia 6.225@xcite was used to compute the contributions from all annihilation channels  .",
    "however , all the tested model spectra still deviate significantly from the observed power - law spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edis ] .",
    "on the other hand , if the bulk of the vhe emission has non - dm  origin , there is still the possibility of a dm  signal hidden under an astrophysical spectrum.to search for such a contribution , we fitted the experimental spectrum as the sum of a power - law with free normalization and index , and a mssm  ( or kk ) spectrum . leaving the normalisation of the dm  signal free , the range of @xmath6 is scanned . for the mssm , annihilation spectra @xmath53",
    "are used with three different sets of parameters , one approximating the average annihilation spectrum ( @xmath54 ) the other two ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) roughly encompassing the range of model spectra generated using dark  susy  @xcite .",
    "no significant dm  component is detected with this procedure , the dm  component flux upper limit being of the order of 10% of the source flux . assuming a nfw profile , 99% cl upper limits on the velocity - weighted annihilation cross section @xmath10 are of the order of @xmath57 , above the predicted values of the order of @xmath58 .",
    "these limits can vary by plus or minus three orders of magnitude if one assumes other dm  halo shapes . in the case of adiabatic compression of dm  due to the infall of baryons to the gc",
    ", the flux could be boosted up to a factor @xmath59  @xcite . the h.e.s.s .",
