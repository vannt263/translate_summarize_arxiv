    "a deconfined state of quarks and gluons , generally known as the quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is expected to be formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . due to their large mass , heavy - quarks , i.e.",
    "charm and beauty quarks , are produced at the early stages of the collisions via hard scattering processes .",
    "therefore , they can experience the complete evolution of the system and interact with the created hot medium .",
    "theoretical model calculations based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predict a mass - dependent energy loss due to the mass - dependent restriction of the phase space of the gluon radiation .",
    "therefore , heavy quarks are expected to lose less energy compared to the light quarks  @xcite .",
    "in addition , gluons are considered to lose more energy than quarks due to their stronger colour coupling  @xcite .",
    "experimentally this can be studied by measuring the nuclear modification factor of hadrons containing heavy quarks , which is defined as the ratio between the differential yield measured in pb ",
    "pb ( or p  pb ) collisions and the cross section measured in pp collisions multiplied by the average nuclear overlap function .",
    "the degree of the thermalisation of the heavy quarks in the medium can be studied by measuring the anisotropic flow parameter @xmath2 , second harmonic of the fourier expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution , of the heavy - flavour particles at low transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the elliptic flow measurement at high @xmath3 gives information about the path - length dependence of energy loss of the heavy quarks .",
    "measurements of heavy - flavour particles in pp collisions are studied to test the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations and to set a baseline for both pb  pb and p  pb collisions .",
    "studies of heavy - quark production as a function of charged - particle multiplicity in pp collisions are expected to be sensitive to the interplay between hard and soft qcd processes and therefore they give insight into the multi - parton interactions ( mpi )  @xcite .",
    "measurements of open heavy - flavour production in p ",
    "pb collisions can be used to disentangle cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , such as the modification of nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdf )  @xcite and @xmath4 broadening , from final - state effects occurring in the qgp . in this article",
