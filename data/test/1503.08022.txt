    "the physics of multiparton interactions ( mpi ) , in general , or double parton scattering ( dps ) for hard processes gained recently a new impulse related to the experiments at large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the dps contributions were discused for several reactions to mention double drell - yan @xcite , creation of @xmath0 @xcite , etc .",
    "it was predicted @xcite and recently found @xcite that the double parton scattering leads to very abundant production of ( at least ) two @xmath1 pairs at the lhc .",
    "another process where dps seems to be seen is double @xmath2 production in the region of large rapidity separation between the two @xmath3 s @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss in this letter evident progress in theoretical understanding of the dps or mpi interaction in general , which took place in recent years .",
    "in contrast to very quantitative and precise studies of many sps perturbative partonic processes the field of mpi and dps lacks similar precision .",
    "so far most of the experimental studies have concentrated on the extraction of @xmath4 in so - called factorized ansatz may be subtle @xcite . ] . in our opinion , at present some efforts should be made in order to make the studies of dps processes really quantitative and differential in kinematical variables . in order to make more detailed phenomenological studies one needs also more clear cases where the dps effects could be identified without any doubts .",
    "four - jet production was traditionally discussed in the context of double parton scattering .",
    "actually it was a first process where the dps was claimed to be observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , in most of the past as well as current analyses the dps contribution to four - jet production is relatively small and single parton scattering ( sps ) driven by the 2 @xmath5 4 partonic processes dominates . to pin down the dps contribution one has to make rather complicated studies comparing monte carlo templates and experimental data . in such a case",
    "the result is not very transparent and one may worry whether the final result is not an artifact of an inadequate monte carlo generator .",
    "a more evident result for dps in four - jet production would clearly provide a new impulse for the mpi community .    on the theoretical side",
    "the dps effects in four - jet production were discussed in refs .",
    "a first theoretical estimate of sps four - jet production , including only some partonic subprocesses , and its comparison to dps contribution was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for tevatron .",
    "some new kinematical variables useful for identification of dps were proposed in ref .",
    "a model dependence on collision energy and minimal transverse energy of @xmath4 was studied in ref .",
    "presence of perturbative parton splitting mechanism in the context of four - jet production was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our recent studies",
    "we have shown how big can be the contribution of dps for ( two ) jets widely separated in rapidity @xcite .",
    "understanding of this contribution is important in the context of searching for bfkl effects or in general qcd higher - order effects @xcite .",
    "we have found that with the present cuts used in the cms analysis @xcite the dps contribution can be of the order of 10 - 20% .",
    "it could be still somewhat enhanced imposing further cuts on transverse momentum of the dijets or azimuthal angle between jets .    in the present letter",
    "we wish to explore exclusive four - jet sample where the situation in the context of searching for dps should be even better .",
    "we shall discuss how to maximize the dps contribution by selecting relevant kinematical cuts .",
    "partonic cross sections used to calculate dps are only in leading order .",
    "the cross section for dijet production can be then written as : @xmath6 in our calculations we include all leading - order @xmath7 partonic subprocesses .",
    "the @xmath8-factor for dijet production is rather small , of the order of @xmath9 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but can be easily incorporated in our calculations .",
    "it was shown that already the leading - order approach gives results in sufficiently reasonable agreement with recent atlas and cms inclusive jet data @xcite .",
    "this simplified leading - order approach can be however used easily in calculating dps differential cross sections .",
    "the multi - dimensional differential cross section can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and partons @xmath12 .",
    "the combinatorial factors include identity of the two subprocesses .",
    "each step of dps is calculated in the leading - order approach ( see eq.([lo_sps ] ) ) .    experimental data from tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite",
    "provide an estimate of @xmath4 in the denominator of formula ( [ dps ] ) . in the calculations we have taken in most cases",
    "@xmath4 = 15 mb .",
    "phenomenological studies of @xmath4 are summarized e.g. in @xcite with the average value @xmath13 15 mb .",
    "now we proceed to the sps production mechanisms of four - jet production .",
    "the elementary cross section for the sps mechanism has the following generic form : @xmath14 where the invariant phase space reads : @xmath15 above @xmath16 are four - momenta of outgoing partons ( jets ) .",
    "many possible subprocesses @xmath17 are possible in general . in some corners of the phase space only some processes are really important and others may be safely neglected",
    ".    the hadronic cross section is then given by the integral @xmath18 above @xmath19 and @xmath20 are parton ( gluon , quark , antiquark ) distribution function .",
    "instead of explicitly using the formulae above we shall use its monte carlo version as implemented in the event generator alpgen @xcite .",
    "weighted events from the generator will be used to construct distributions presented in the next section . only light quarks / antiquarks are included in our calculation .",
    "to start our analysis we wish to check how reliable our sps four jet calculation is . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cms - data-1 ] we confront the results of calculation with the leading - order code alpgen @xcite with recent cms experimental data @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the cms collaboration imposed different transverse momentum cuts on the leading , subleading , 3@xmath21 and 4@xmath22 jets ( see the figure caption ) . in this calculation",
    "we have used an extra @xmath8-factor to effectively include higher - order effects .",
    "how big is the @xmath8-factor was discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the next - to - leading order contributions are important and lead to @xmath23 1 . in our calculation here",
    "we will use the @xmath8-factor found there .",
    "we get relatively good description of both transverse moentum and pseudorapidity distributions of each of the four ( ordered in transverse momentum ) jets .",
    "therefore we conclude that the calculation with the alpgen generator can be a reliable sps reference point for the dps effects .            in fig .",
    "[ fig : cms - data-2 ] we show in addition the calculated contributions of dps for different values of the @xmath4 parameter .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter effectively includes both traditional ( independent emissions ) dps and effects related to parton splitting @xcite . in general , the relative contribution of both mechanisms may depend on different kinematical variables .",
    "phenomenological exploration of the dependences may help in understanding the interplay of the different contributions and shed more light on the underlying mechanism .",
    "we observe that the dps contribution is rather small ( independent of @xmath4 parameter ) at larger transverse momenta and in midrapidities of jets .",
    "their contribution increases when going to small transverse momenta and large rapidities .",
    "we observe a clear improvements at large pseudorapidities ( @xmath24 3 ) when the dps contribution is added to the sps contribution .",
    "the presented cms data were not optimized for search for dps effects and now we wish to explore how to improve the situation .",
    "i.e. to enhance sample of the dps events .",

    "[ fig : deltay - dps-1 ] we show some examples of such distributions for different cuts on the jet transverse momenta for two collision energies @xmath25 = 7 tev and @xmath25 = 14 tev obtained with the condition of the four - jet observation .",
    "we focus only on the distance between the most remote jets ; the other two jets are then in between . the higher collision energy or the smaller the lower transverse momentum cut the bigger the relative dps contribution . in such cases one can therefore expect a considerable deficit when only sps four jets are included .",
    "such cases would be very useful to `` extract '' the @xmath4 parameter which for the selected sample does not to be the same as for other cases discussed in the literature . any deviation from the `` canonical '' value of 15 mb",
    "would therefore shed some new light on the underlying dynamics .",

    "[ fig : ptsum - dps-1 ] we show an example for one energy and one cut on jet transverse momenta . in these calculations",
    "we have not included extra cut on jet rapidity separation .",
    "the dps and sps distributions look rather similar for the four - jet sample .",
    "this shows that an extra cut on the transverse momentum of the pair of the most remote jets would almost not help to enhance the dps contribution .",

    "imposing in addition that the distance between the remote jets is bigger than @xmath28 7 enhances the dps contribution to almost 90% . therefore imposing such cuts would help to extract fairly precisely the @xmath4 parameter from such experimental studies .",

    "in the present paper we have explored how to enhance the relative contribution of double - parton scattering for four - jet production . compared to our previous studies , where we focussed on jets with large rapidity separation ( important in searches for the bfkl dynamics ) , here we have studied the case of exclusive four - jet production .",
    "we have shown that already some present data for four - jet production obtained at the lhc by the cms collaboration with relatively small cuts on transverse momenta indicate some evidence of dps at large pseudorapidities of the leading jet .",
