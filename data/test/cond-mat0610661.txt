    "quantum phase transitions constitute a very active topic in theoretical physics @xcite , to which disorder and frustration of a quantum spin glass add considerable intricacies @xcite .",

    "one of the most widely employed theoretical approaches to the quantum spin - glass transition ( qsgt ) is the random couplings ising model in a transverse field ( ritf ) @xcite . within the analytical approach",
    ", a griffiths phase was found in the 1d case via an elegant rg procedure @xcite , while such a structure was proved to be absent from the infinite range case within the replica formalism @xcite .",

    "regarding numerical approaches , quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) remains as the most suitable tool at @xmath0 .",
    "using it , a coherent picture was obtained in the 2d and 3d cases , showing that the griffiths phase is present in 2d but absent in 3d @xcite .",
    "classical spin glasses have been thoroughly analysed on bethe lattices @xcite .",
    "however , finite bethe lattices are dominated by boundary effects and present no frustration . a way out is to study random graphs with a fixed connectivity which , in the classical case , allow the application of the _ cavity approach _ @xcite .",
    "these random graphs present genuine frustration , since they have _ loops _ , and have no boundaries . on the other hand",
    ", the average size of the loops grows with the number of sites @xcite , thus making them resemble , _ locally _ , a bethe lattice ( see figure [ graph : fig ] ) .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite is known to be a highly accurate method to analyze @xmath1 ground state properties of 1d or quasi-1d quantum many body systems , including tree structures @xcite .",
    "we have extended the method in order to trace the behaviour of finite size samples of random graphs of fixed connectivity @xmath2 across the qsgt within the ritf model . given the high connectivity of these graphs ,",
    "the applicability of the dmrg is highly non - trivial .",
    "it is remarkable that in the case of non - random couplings , we have found the number of retained states needed to ensure a good accuracy to be very high , rendering the application of the dmrg unfeasible .    the careful analysis of _",
    "pseudo-_critical points of finite size samples constitutes a powerful tool to study a qsgt . as a recent example , the work of igli and coworkers @xcite studies the distributions of , e.g. , the average entanglement entropy and the surface magnetization of finite size 1d samples . in this work",
    "we provide measurements of , among other observables , spin - glass susceptibilities , energy gaps , long distance spin - spin correlations and entanglement entropies , and use them to obtain insight on the mechanism of the transition .",
    "a full characterization of the qsgt , nonetheless , is not attempted in this work , since it would require to obtain statistics on a large number of disorder realizations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ model : sec ] presents the model , and sec .",
    "[ dmrg ] provides details on the application of dmrg .",
    "[ results ] shows the numerical dmrg results obtained .",
    "[ conclusions ] presents a discussion of the results and some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the random ising model in a transverse field ( ritf ) on a generic graph @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes pairs of neighboring sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the graph .",
    "the values of @xmath7 are uncorrelated random variables with a uniform probability density distribution in the interval @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we will focus our study on randomly generated graphs , with @xmath9 sites and a fixed connectivity @xmath2 @xcite , i.e. , each site @xmath5 is connected to @xmath2 other ( randomly chosen ) sites @xmath6 .",
    "an example of such a graph , with @xmath10 sites , is shown in fig .",
    "[ graph : fig ] .",
    "it should be noticed that , locally and for large @xmath9 , such graphs resemble _ bethe lattices _ , as we have highlighted with thicker links in fig .  [ graph : fig ] . nonetheless , the behaviour of finite bethe lattices is dominated by the boundary , unlike in our case , where there is none . moreover , trees have no loops and , therefore , present no _ frustration _ , while random graphs with fixed connectivity do contain loops and , therefore , have genuine frustration .",
    "it has been proved , nonetheless , that short loops become rare as @xmath11 : more precisely , the probability of finding a loop of any fixed size @xmath12 falls to zero when @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the physics of classical spin glasses in these graphs has been studied using the cavity method by mzard and parisi @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be the absolute value of the disorder - averaged energy per site of the classical ground state .",
    "our numerical experiments show that it increases from @xmath14 at @xmath15 up to @xmath16 for larger @xmath9 , which is the theoretical limiting value for @xmath11 under the assumption that all links are satisfied .",
    "we will take the product of eigenstates of @xmath17 , for all @xmath5 , as the _ canonical basis _ for our problem . in this basis",
    ", we denote the state in which all spins point in the positive @xmath18-direction as @xmath19 .",
    "let us assume , for the moment , that @xmath20 for all @xmath5 . for @xmath21 , all the non - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian vanish .",
    "therefore , the ground state is given by the configurations with the classical minimum energy .",
    "disregarding accidental degeneracies , there are two such configurations , related by a simultaneous flip of all spins , @xmath22 for all @xmath5 .",
    "the transverse field @xmath23 may be considered as a _ kinetic energy _ coefficient , providing a hopping term among the classical configurations . in the @xmath24",
    "limit the transverse field term dominates and the ground state tends to the state @xmath25 , with all the spins pointing in the positive @xmath18-direction , separated by a large gap @xmath26 from the first excited state .",
    "let us remark that all the components of the canonical basis have the same amplitude in the state @xmath25 .",
    "by decreasing @xmath23 there is a certain value @xmath27 for which the system undergoes a quantum spin - glass transition ( qsgt ) . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the system is in a quantum paramagnetic phase , which presents no long - range order .",
    "below @xmath29 , the system is in a quantum spin - glass phase , presenting a hidden long - range order which may be detected by a number of observables .",
    "we will focus here on the divergence of the _ spin - glass susceptibility _ : @xmath30 i.e. , physically , a small longitudinal magnetic field @xmath31 , applied at site @xmath6 , generates a magnetization response on each site @xmath5 , which is measured ( and squared , so as to disregard its sign ) ; the results are summed over all sites @xmath5 and averaged over all sites @xmath6 . if the system is in a paramagnetic phase , the magnetization will be proportional to @xmath31 and short - ranged in space , so that the sum over @xmath5 and @xmath6 yields a finite value for @xmath32 . on the other hand , on approaching the spin - glass phase , an infinitesimally small longitudinal magnetic field @xmath31 , localized at a single site @xmath6 , will eventually induce a finite magnetization over a long - range of spins .",
    "this effect is at the origin of the divergence of @xmath32 .",
    "we shall now discuss the numerical approach we have used to study this system , and the results obtained .",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has proved to be an accurate method to analyse the properties of 1d and quasi-1d systems @xcite .",
    "the dmrg may be described as a variational method within the matrix - product states ( mps ) , which constitute a low - dimensional subspace of the full hilbert space @xcite .",
    "a mps may be expressed as @xmath33 where each @xmath34 is a square matrix with dimension @xmath35 , which may be considered as the number of retained states per block when splitting the system into a left and right parts .",
    "the total number of variational parameters is less than @xmath36 .",
    "the success of the dmrg is related to the ability of these mps to reproduce faithfully the ground states of local 1d many - body problems for low values of @xmath35 @xcite . if @xmath37 , any state of the hilbert space may be exactly represented as a mps .",
    "the minimum number of retained states @xmath35 is related to the exponential of the von neumann entanglement entropy of the dmrg block @xcite . in a non - critical 1d system , this entropy is bounded for all sizes , while it grows as @xmath38 for a 1d critical system of length @xmath12 .",
    "it is believed that for a @xmath39-dimensional system out of criticality , the entanglement entropy scales as @xmath40 , where @xmath12 is the shortest spatial dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "this estimate is known as the _ area law _ and is believed to have logarithmic corrections at critical points .",
    "an important practical consequence is that , in order to study a 2d system , the number of retained states @xmath35 should grow as @xmath41 , thus making the dmrg very inefficient .",
    "our system , on the other hand , is defined on a random graph of fixed connectivity , @xmath2 .",
    "we will show that this poses no problem to the number of retained states @xmath35 , which appears to remain manageable even for @xmath42 as long as the couplings are random .",
    "however , the implementation of the dmrg on such a model has required the following technical refinements of the original method :    * ( a ) path selection . * : :    in a non-1d system , dmrg proceeds by converting the system into an    effective 1d problem with long - range couplings .",
    "a path is chosen along    the graph , which does not repeat sites , and is considered to be    appropriate if the number of broken links between the left and the    right blocks is kept low along a dmrg sweep .",
    "normally , the selection    of a suitable path in a quasi-1d system ( e.g. ladders ) is done by    geometrical intuition . in our implementation",
    "we have designed an    automated procedure : a simulated annealing algorithm is employed in    order to minimize the number of broken links .",
    "the full problem of    finding the optimal path is computationally very hard .",
    "therefore , we    do not aim at the exact optimum , but only to a reasonably good local    minimum .",
    "we have noticed that our quasi - optimal path performs much    better than a random path . *",
    "( b ) perron - frobenius criterion . * : :    the hamiltonian of the ritf on any graph fulfills , on the canonical    basis , the conditions of the perron - frobenius theorem , i.e. , all    off - diagonal components are _ non - positive_. hence , all the ground    state components must have the same sign . using the mps representation    of the ground state",
    "obtained within the dmrg , it is always possible to    reconstruct the amplitude of any configuration    @xmath43 .",
    "the obtention of the full    @xmath44 is unfeasible , since it would require    reconstructing the amplitude of an exponentially large number of    configurations .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible to pick up a few random    configurations @xmath45 , and check that all their amplitudes    have the same sign .",
    "whenever this criterion was not met a rather rare    event , the calculation was repeated changing the random seed for the    lanczos procedure on the first dmrg step . *",
    "( c ) wavefunction annealing .",
    "* : :    for large @xmath23 the ground state    @xmath25 is easily representable as a mps ,    requiring a single retained state .",
    "the dmrg works extremely well in    this regime and , therefore , our simulations are always started well    within the paramagnetic ( large @xmath23 ) phase .",
    "the qsgt    is approached by repeatedly decreasing the value of    @xmath23 by a small amount , always using the previous    ground state as a seed for the new calculation , exploiting the    wavefunction transformations suggested by white @xcite .",
    "this type of    _ annealing _ of the ground state provides a faster convergence and more    accurate results for low @xmath23 . *",
    "( d ) adaptive number of retained states . * : :    the number of retained states @xmath35 , and the number of dmrg    sweeps @xmath46 , are not fixed in our algorithm .",
    "we set a    maximum value for the sum of the neglected eigenvalues of the density    matrix in the rg truncation ( @xmath47 ) , and    select @xmath35 accordingly .",
    "moreover , sometimes convergence    takes more sweeps than usual ( @xmath48 ) in order to obtain machine precision in the convergence of    the ground state energy . *",
    "( e ) energy gap measurements . * : :    when there is a symmetry in a problem , e.g. , under su(2 ) , it is    usually possible to obtain the first excited state as the ground state    of a different _ sector _ of the hilbert space . in our case , lacking    this , the best option has proved to be the following one . for each    dmrg step , after the ground state @xmath49 had been    found , it was `` promoted '' to a higher energy by the following    transformation of the hamiltonian :    +    @xmath50    +    in such a way that the ground state of this new hamiltonian is the    former first excited state , as long as we take    @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the gap we    are looking for . the density matrix used for truncation",
    "was built as a    linear combination of the density matrices for each state , with equal    weights .",
    "however , we should remember that only ground states of local    hamiltonians are expected to be faithfully represented by mps @xcite ,    and eq .",
    "( [ h.gap ] ) does not define a local hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the    accuracy in the gap estimate is worse than that in the ground state    energy and in other observables .",
    "we have applied the modified dmrg technique to study a few samples of random graphs with fixed connectivity @xmath2 and sizes ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath42 .",
    "a full characterization of the qsgt would require relevant statistics on the disorder .",
    "unfortunately , in order to obtain a high accuracy for each sample , the required cpu - time is rather large .",
    "therefore , we have decided to focus on a precise study of a few realizations , in order to gain insight on the mechanism of the transition for finite samples .",
    "most of our findings will be illustrated in the figures of this section by showing in detail the results obtained for a sample with @xmath54 sites .",
    "it should be remarked that the highlighted features are typical of all the ensemble .",
    "the numerical simulations were done with the dmrg algorithm explained in section [ dmrg ] , with a neglected probability tolerance @xmath55 and a tolerance on the convergence of the energy of one part in @xmath56 , for ten samples of each size ( @xmath57 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 400 , 500 ) .",
    "each sample is a different random graph , always with fixed connectivity @xmath2 , and the bonds @xmath7 are random and independent , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "figure [ xsg : fig](a ) shows three observables calculated for a given instance of a @xmath54 graph , as a fuction of @xmath23 .",
    "the most relevant quantity is the spin - glass susceptibility , defined in equation [ xsg ] .",
    "a small magnetic field @xmath58 is applied at a single site @xmath59 , and the magnetic response is measured with the formula @xmath60 which is found to increase very fast as @xmath23 approaches @xmath61 from above , and thereupon saturating at a very high value .",
    "figure [ xsg : fig](b ) proves the divergence of @xmath32 by showing its behavior at three different values of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) : the saturation value is seen to scale as @xmath66 .",
    "we estimate the _",
    "pseudo-_critical value @xmath29 for the given sample as the value of @xmath23 at which the slope of the susceptibility attains its maximum . with this definition",
    ", @xmath29 appears to be almost independent of the chosen site @xmath59 , at our level of precision @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ xsg : fig](c ) , finally , shows @xmath32 for ten different samples with @xmath54 sites , differing in the graph structure and in the choice of the couplings @xmath7 , and diverging at different ( sample dependent ) values of @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ xsg : fig](a ) also shows two other observables which point towards the same value for @xmath29 .",
    "the first is the block entanglement entropy , defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the reduced density matrix for a part of the system .",
    "it is measured for all the left - right decompositions along a dmrg sweep , and its maximum value is denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "this value of @xmath70 is obviously dependent on the dmrg path .",
    "nonetheless , since this path has been chosen so as to minimize the number of retained states , it is expected that it will also minimize the maximum value of the entropy .",
    "it should be emphasized that this observable attains its maximum value , as a function of @xmath23 , at the same @xmath29 which is found by analyzing the spin - glass susceptibility .",
    "the relevance of the entanglement entropy in order to characterize the critical point of a qsgt has already been remarked in the literature @xcite .",
    "the dmrg , being based on the obtention and analysis of the density matrix of different parts of the system , is specially well suited for measuring this observable @xcite .",
    "the other observable shown in figure [ xsg : fig](a ) is the energy gap @xmath52 , which extrapolates to zero at a value of @xmath23 which is close to @xmath29 .",
    "the sign of the difference between these two pseudo - critical points is sample dependent .",
    "this discrepancy is likely to be a finite size effect .",
    "the next observable that we calculated for each sample is the average value of @xmath71 , see figure [ szzsx : fig ] . for high @xmath23 ,",
    "the transverse field is dominant , the ground state is close to @xmath25 and the value of @xmath71 is close to 1 .",
    "as we decrease @xmath23 , this value is reduced .",
    "it is remarkable that , at the value of @xmath29 defined by @xmath32 , and confirmed by the maximum block entropy , @xmath71 is never lower than @xmath72 , at variance with the 1d ritf , where it is normal to have values below @xmath73 .    also in figure [ szzsx : fig ]",
    "we have plotted the behavior of the quantum equivalent of the @xmath74 order parameter , which measures the magnitude of the long - distance spatial correlations @xcite , @xmath75 our definition differs slightly from that used commonly in the literature on classical spin glasses . instead of the long - distance behavior",
    ", we measure the global average behavior .",
    "they are equivalent in a system with a bethe lattice topology because the number of neighbours of a given site at distance @xmath76 scales as @xmath77 . also note that these two observables , @xmath71 and @xmath74 have the advantage that they do not vanish trivially in the absence of external longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "this quantity is close to zero within the paramagnetic phase , and takes a non - zero value inside the spin - glass phase .",
    "figure [ szzsx : fig ] shows that the behaviours of @xmath74 and @xmath71 are highly correlated , both pointing to a pseudo - critical point which is , in many instances , sensibly lower than the one obtained with @xmath32 and @xmath70 .",
    "this systematic discrepancy is not explainable in the framework of classical physics , since the fluctuation - dissipation theorem leads to the proportionality of @xmath74 and @xmath32 @xcite . in the quantum case , @xmath32 is not equivalent to @xmath74 , but to    @xmath78 ^ 2\\ ] ]    where the integral is performed on imaginary time , from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , in quantum spin - glasses , @xmath32 contains a contribution from time - correlations , while @xmath74 only measures spatial ones .",
    "their different divergence points might suggest that long - distance correlations develop at a higher value of @xmath23 in time than in space .    at different sizes @xmath9 ,",
    "the behavior of the various samples is qualitatively similar , the only difference being the sample - dependent value of @xmath81 .",
    "it is possible to construct histograms showing , for different @xmath9 , the probability distribution of the various @xmath81 . as a preliminary result",
    ", we mark in figure [ gammac_vs_n : fig ] by empty circles the @xmath29 values obtained for 10 samples of different sizes : @xmath9=50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 400 , and 500 . the crosses mark , for each size @xmath9 , the average values of @xmath81 , which apparently saturate at some point around @xmath82 .    a useful clue to the physics of this system across the transition is obtained by monitoring selected wavefunction components of the ground state as a function of @xmath23 , which can be easily done with the dmrg .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ wf : fig ] , for a sample with @xmath15 whose @xmath29 is marked by the arrow .",
    "one of the monitored configurations is the classical ground state of the system .",
    "( naturally , there are two of them , related by a global spin - flip , which we denote by @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "they are obtained by measuring the values of @xmath85 at each site for very low @xmath23 under the presence of a very small longitudinal field @xmath86 that splits the degeneracy between them .",
    "we will consider its weight to be the sum of their probabilities . )",
    "the weight of the classical ground state grows up to @xmath87 as @xmath23 is decreased .",
    "a second monitored configuration is picked at random ( dashed lower line in figure [ wf : fig ] ) : the weight of such a random configuration is similar to that of all the others only for very large values @xmath23 , while it is definitely much smaller when @xmath23 approaches the pseudo - critical point .",
    "the remaining monitored configurations in figure [ wf : fig ] are obtained by classical simulated annealing , i.e. , they are local minima of the classical energy .",
    "these configurations maintain a high weight ( similar to that of the optimal configuration ) across the transition , up to a value of @xmath23 below which their weight decline markedly .    therefore , the number of relevant classical configurations contributing to the ground state changes drastically across @xmath29 . deep into the paramagnetic phase ,",
    "all of them have the same weight , coherently bound within the @xmath25 state .",
    "this state retains a high weight at @xmath29 , as shown by the high values taken by @xmath71 at that moment . within the spin - glass phase",
    ", the weight of the different configurations is gradually redistributed according to their classical energies , until eventually only the classical ground state remains .",
    "it should be remarked that the dmrg was applicable in practice only in the case of random couplings . for random graphs with fixed values of @xmath88 ( either ferro or antiferromagnetic ) , the number of retained states needed for a similar accuracy increased in an order of magnitude , rendering impractical the calculations .",
    "it should be remarked that a quantum phase transition may be observed exactly in the mps formalism with as few as two retained states per block @xcite .",
    "the low values of @xmath70 measured in our system points to the fact that the number of states involved in the qsgt is reduced .",
    "thus , in an attempt to explain the transition we might build a simple - minded ansatz consistent of a linear combination of only two states : the classical ground state @xmath89 and a _ background state _ containing the rest of classical configurations :      neglecting matrix elements which are exponentially small for large @xmath9 , there is a very sharp crossover at @xmath91 , from state @xmath92 to state @xmath44 .",
    "this last state clearly presents a divergent spin - glass susceptibility .",
    "the physics of our model is actually more complicated than this simple ansatz , as shown by the numerical estimate , @xmath93 for large @xmath9 .",
    "an interesting question is how our system differs from the 1d ritf analyzed by fisher and coworkers @xcite . in 1d",
    ", duality arguments and a detailed rg analysis give a value of @xmath29 satisfying @xmath94_{av}$ ] , where @xmath95_{av}$ ] indicates a disorder average .",
    "this equation leads to values of @xmath29 much lower than those measured in our random graph case ( e.g. , for our distribution of @xmath7 , fisher s model yields @xmath96 , while in our case it reaches @xmath97 for @xmath42 sites ) .",
    "the higher connectivity seems to make a large difference in that respect .",
    "moreover , in our case , the value of @xmath71 at the transition is fairly high , about @xmath72 , while it is almost always below @xmath73 for ritf chains with the same sizes .",
    "this means that the state @xmath25 is still dominant in the paramagnetic phase at the moment of the divergence of the spin - glass susceptibility .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have extended the dmrg to make it suitable to study the qsgt on random graphs .",
    "the main technical innovations are the path - selection , which reduces the maximum number of retained states , and the wavefunction annealing , which allows to use the ground state for a certain value of @xmath23 as a seed to obtain the ground state for a lower value .",
    "this modified dmrg algorithm has been applied to the measurement of the energy gap @xmath52 , spin - glass susceptibility @xmath32 , entanglement entropy @xmath70 , long - distance spatial correlations @xmath74 and average @xmath18-magnetization @xmath71 to high precision on a few samples of different sizes , ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath42 sites .",
    "remarkably , @xmath70 attains its maximum at the same value of @xmath27 at which @xmath32 diverges .",
    "this led us to consider this value as our candidate for the pseudo - critical point .",
    "the energy gap @xmath52 vanishes in the surroundings of that value for all realizations . in most disorder realizations , @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath71 start their crossover at a value of @xmath23 which is inferior to @xmath29 .",
    "this may suggest that long - range temporal correlations develop at a higher value of @xmath23 than purely spatial ones .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our definition of @xmath70 constitutes an alternative approach to the entanglement entropy on random graphs .",
    "its relation to the standard block entropy , defined as the entanglement entropy obtained by tracing out a site and its neighbours up to a certain distance , remains as an open question .",
    "we have also monitored the ground state probabilities of several classical low - energy configurations , showing that , as @xmath23 is reduced below @xmath29 , these probabilities increase exponentially until they attain a maximum value and then fall to zero , leaving the classical minimum energy configuration as the only ground state component as @xmath98 .",
    "the fact that the model on such disordered graph was amenable to analysis within the dmrg is non - trivial .",
    "both @xmath70 and the maximum number of retained states per block increase slowly with the system size . in a restricted sense , the system behaves similarly to a 1d chain , despite the high connectivity of the underlying graph .",
    "this is a rather remarkable effect due to the disorder , which perhaps leads to the selection of an effective 1d path of strong bonds .",
    "if the couplings @xmath88 are not random , we have found that the number of retained states per block increases in a much more pronounced way , rendering the numerical dmrg approach impractical .",
    "it will be interesting and is left to a future study to understand quantitatively how the entanglement entropy at the transition behaves as a function of the system size , both for random and non - random couplings @xcite ."
