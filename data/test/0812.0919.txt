    "at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) the major part of top quarks are produced in pairs . due to",

    "the production of top anti - top quark pairs close to the kinematical threshold has received much attention in the context of precision measurement of top quark properties at a future international linear collider ( ilc ) .",

    "in contrast to the linear collider , where the physical observable is the total cross section as a function of energy , at the hadron collider one considers the invariant mass distribution of the top quark pairs . since the expected uncertainty is significant larger than the one anticipated at a linear collider a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) analysis is probably sufficient .",
