    "1d imagines that * a * and * b * occur at the _ same time _ , but that is not the causal order determined by eq .  4 .",
    "the relativistic ordering of events as seen by different lorentz observers has nothing to do with the absolute causal ordering that puts event * a * before event * b*.        the influence of a hellwig - kraus collapse may seem to extend infinitely far into space and time but that is not true . the limited influence of event * b * in fig .",

    "they appear as a mountainous landscape where the mountain peak in the foreground is causally prior to a peak in the background .",
    "this means that the ones in the back are causally limited in their influence by the ones in the front . in a 2 + 1 space ,",
    "the landscape will appear as a two dimensional superposition of mountaintops on a landscape of prior mountaintops .",
    "in the second order probability that both events * a * and * b * are chosen in a single component , neither one would influence the interior of the backward time cone of the other , so we would have a double - peaked mountain .",
    "every event in the universe is located in one or another of these mountainous peaks  like event * a * in the background peak on the left in fig .  2 , or * b * in the middle - right peak .",
    "a modified hellwig - kraus collapse not only provides a non - local causal influence , it also organizes events into an absolute causal framework without regard to relativistic simultaneity .",
    "figure 2 is the view from one lorentz frame in which the foreground mountain peak is higher than the background peak immediately to its right . in another lorentz frame",
    "the background frame might be higher than the foreground peak .",
    "however , the causal order will be the same in both .",

    "some interactions , like a scattering interaction , give rise to a continuous change in the wave function that occurs entirely within a single component of the wave function .",
    "other interactions produce a discontinuous quantum jump that requires the creation of a new component that can not arise continuously from the given component .    if there is a discontinuous interaction between two objects @xmath41 and @xmath46 giving rise to a new _ ready _",
    "component @xmath47 , then the state function @xmath48 will be dependent on three differential times @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 such that    @xmath52    @xmath53    again dropping references to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the dynamic principle is now given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "this equation does not break down into two independent parts as does eq .",
    "8 because the emerging function @xmath56 is dependent on the given functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath55 borrows from @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the best way to proceed is in the interaction picture .",
    "* interaction picture *    the interaction hamiltonian introduces a new state variable    @xmath61    the time derivative of this is    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66\\ ] ]    the new solution is propagated through time by the interaction hamiltonian in this picture .",
    "it explicitly uses time coordinates @xmath67 , @xmath68 in the definition of @xmath69 .",
    "nature does not introduce integrated times like these , but we use them because it is analytically useful to do so .",
    "it does no harm to introduce these variables inasmuch as they do not appear in the dynamic process that drives the system , and they do not appear in the final result below .",
    "from the equation @xmath48 and the fact that the square modulus of @xmath70 is equal to that of @xmath71 = exp i(@xmath72)@xmath70 in the interaction picture , we have @xmath73 this equation must be non - zero for some set of events * a * , * b * , and * c * , although event designations have again been dropped . take @xmath74 and from eq .",
    "10 @xmath75 inasmuch as @xmath69 is hermitean . from eq .",
    "11 we then have @xmath76 therefore the square modulus of both @xmath70 and @xmath70 is _ conserved _ at any location * a * , * b * , and * c*. as the square modulus of @xmath77 and 2re(@xmath78 * ) lose amplitude at their respective events , the component c gains square modulus at event * c*.    this tells us that although the definition of state does not establish a common temporal relationship between the particles , the interaction hamiltonian establishes a relationship between the derivatives @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . the result in eq .",
    "12 is independent of @xmath71 or @xmath82 so it is independent of the integrated values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 that define them .",
    "the question arises as to the physical significance of the cross term 2re(@xmath78 * ) in eqs .",
    "11 and 12 .",
    "whereas @xmath83 is understood to be the probability that the system is in its original state at events * a * and * b * , and @xmath84 is the probability that the new state will be found at event * c * , the cross term has no obvious interpretation .",
    "normally one integrates eq .",
    "12 over all possible events , in which case the cross term goes to zero because the original function @xmath77 is orthogonal to the newly created function @xmath85 .",
    "but in trans - coordinate physics it is meaningless to discuss coordinate based functions and their possible orthogonality .",
    "we are therefore forced to consider the question of how to regard the cross term when we deal exclusively with individual events such as * a * , * b * , and * c*.    experimentally we normalize the state @xmath77 corresponding to the initial conditions at events * a * and * b * , and then focus our attention on the probability of finding state @xmath85 at event * c*. that is , we do not normally pay attention to the sum @xmath83 + 2re(@xmath78 * ) after the experiment has begun .",
    "also , we do nt normally pay attention to narrowly defined events within a piece laboratory apparatus ( such as a detector ) but record the behavior of the instrument as a whole .",
    "so both theory and experiment normally avoid the meaning of the cross term for individual events in eqs .",
    "11 and 12 , and its implications for the born interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "there is no need to avoid this issue .",
    "this component presents no trans - coordinate paradox of meaning or significance for the following reasons .",
    "there are special rules that are auxiliary to the dynamic principle when a quantum jump occurs .",
    "i call them qrules .",
    "they describe the conditions under which the wave function collapses , leaving the newly created component standing by itself .",
    "a complete description is given in ref .",
    "a trans - coordinate modification of these rules appears in the appendix of this paper .",
    "there is no reason to think that nature is concerned with the cross term in eqs .",
    "11 and 12 , for the square modulus @xmath86 is only a consideration in _ our _ analysis .",
    "nowhere in the dynamic principle or in the qrules ( as given in the appendix ) is there a reference to a square modulus except in the definition of probability current in qrule # 2 , and that pertains only to the square modulus of the newly created ( ready ) component in a discontinuous interaction .",
    "nature , we say , has no reason to refer to square modulus except in the narrow definition in the appendix qrule # 2 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we make _ no reference _ to the born interpretation of quantum mechanics and in fact reject that interpretation .",
    "the ` interpretation ' given here is entirely contained in the auxiliary qrule # 2 and is not something we add on top of that .",
    "probability is not a mere  rule of correspondence \" .",
    "it is built operationally into the mechanics of quantum mechanics through qrule # 2 .",
    "the partition lines of a continuous wave function flow smoothly and continuously through space and time .",
    "but when there is as discontinuous change in the wave function , as in a quantum jump of some kind , there will be a discontinuous change in the pattern of partition line ",
    "i.e. , there will be a discontinuous change in the fractional distribution of the object in space .",
    "if an electron falls from the second orbit of an atom to the first orbit its distribution in the space around the atom will discontinuously change , causing the pattern of partition lines to discontinuously change .",
    "therefore during the time it takes for the interaction to be carried out , the atom will support two different partition patterns that have different grids and different wave functions .",
    "we recognize these differences as being different components of the wave function that are in superposition for a time .",
    "the mathematical form of this discontinuity generated by the dynamic principle is that of orthogonality .",
    "however , in the trans - coordinate case it is a _ discontinuity of the partition lines _ that identifies a discontinuous change in the wave function",
    ".    the rules of collapse are called qrules .",
    "they are found in their original form in ref .  4 together with many examples of their application .",
    "in the following they are modified to conform to the requirements of trans - coordinate physics .",
    "the applications in ref .  4 still apply .      * qrule ( 1 ) * : _ if a non - periodic interaction acting on a component generates a partition discontinuity at any event * a * , then these discontinuous lines will establish a new component that will be a ` ready ' component .",
    "components are otherwise ` realized ' . _    [ * note * : a single component of a wave function must have partition lines that are continuous over all of the objects in the state , or at least they must spread continuously from the initial interaction event to cover all the objects in the state . ]    [ * note * : a single component of a wave function must be completely realized or completely ready .",
    "it can not be in - between empirically real and unreal , just as a single component can not support two different partition patterns . ]",
    "[ * note * : the initial component in a qrule equation is realized because it is assumed to be an empirically real initial condition .",
    "if the interaction that generates the second component is periodic ( e.g. , a rabi oscillation ) , then the second component will also be realized . in that case",
    "the first two components will oscillate without collapse .",
    "if the interaction is non - periodic , then it will be ` ready ' and will be subject to the second qrule . ]",
    "the second qrule establishes the existence of a stochastic ` trigger ' , and identifies the ready components of single events as the targets of stochastic choice .",
    "the probability current per unit volume flowing into the ready component @xmath87 at event * a * is equal to @xmath88(*a * ) = @xmath89}@xmath90    * qrule ( 2 ) * : _ the stochastic trigger can only strike a ` ready ' component at a single event * a*. it does so with a probability per unit time per unit volume equal to the probability current per unit volume @xmath91 that flows into it from a ` realized ' component_.          * qrule ( 3 ) * : _ when a ready component is stochastically chosen at event * a * it will immediately become a realized component everywhere forward of the backward time cone of event * a * , and all other components in that region will go immediately to zero_.          i regard the predictions of the qrules as being well substantiated .",
    "this is based on the exhaustive examples of their application in ref .  4 that seem to me ` correct ' beyond doubt .",
    "this is why i include them with the dynamic principle as part of the mechanics of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is nonetheless possible that they are not fundamental in the same way that the laws of spectroscopy are empirically true but not fundamental .",
    "it is possible that these rules might be integrated into the dynamic principle in the same way that ghirardi and pearle have included a stochastic term into the hamiltonian , leading to a collapse of the wave function @xcite .",
    "an integrated theory of that kind seems to me desirable , but to be correct it would have to predict the same experimental results as the qrules .",
    "the theory of ghirardi and pearle does not do that .",
    "i show in another paper that there is at least one experiment in which the qrules predict a collapse that contradicts the ghirardi and pearle theory of spontaneous ."
