    "scalar field - theoretic models play an important role in contemporary theoretical physics . they have a wide range of applications from condensed matter physics @xcite to cosmology @xcite",
    ". an interesting new class of scalar field models has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "such models are called models with v - shaped potentials due to their common property of a non - vanishing first derivative of the potential at the minimum .",
    "this feature introduces a qualitatively new behaviour of fields close to the vacuum .",
    "it turns out that for models with v - shaped potentials the field approaches its vacuum value in a polynomial ( quadratic ) way . as a consequence ,",
    "topological defects ( _ e.g. _ kinks ) have compact support ( so - called _ compactons _ ) , see @xcite . a recently found non - topological object which has the form of an oscillon is also compact , @xcite .",
    "the other group of compact solutions which seem to be very interesting from a physical point of view are q - balls , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the possibility of applying q - balls to boson stars and black holes looks especially attractive @xcite .",
    "also models with standard ( smooth ) field potential can support compact objects if they have non - standard kinetic ( _ e.g. _ quartic ) terms @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these models , known also as k - field models , are studied in the context of the global expansion of the universe ( k - essence ) .",
    "in fact , historically , the first non - topological compact solution was found by roseanau and hyman in a modified kdv system @xcite .",
    "the simplest v - shaped scalar field model is the signum - gordon model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , apart from self - simiar solutions , it supports also so - called shock waves , _",
    "i.e. _ a class of solutions with a field discontinuity that propagates with velocity @xmath0 . the violation of the scaling symmetry of the signum - gordon model has been studied for both self - similar solutions",
    "@xcite and shock waves @xcite . in the following paper we concentrate on the case of shock waves .",
    "the genesis of this paper comes from the observation that a specific class of solutions in @xcite has not been considered .",
    "the new solutions are quite interesting because they merge properties of shock waves ( discontinuity of the field at one end ) and compactons ( quadratic approach to a vacuum value at the other end ) . such a solution is compact in an arbitrary stage of evolution so we call it _ a shock impulse _ instead of _ a shock wave_.    our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly recall the signum - klein - gordon model .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the presentation of a new class of solutions . in the last section",
    "we summarize our paper .",
    "the lagrangian of a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional signum - klein - gordon model reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a scalar field with an interaction given by the potential @xmath3 in @xcite we have proposed a mechanical system which in the limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom is described by the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the quadratic interaction term has been chosen for simplicity .",
    "it is one of the simplest terms that can be used to violatate an exact scaling symetry .",
    "for details see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation reads @xmath4 where we assume ( for physical reasons ) that sign@xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 is a solution of ( [ el ] ) .",
    "this solution is necessary in the construction of compactons .",
    "the ansatz @xmath7 gives discontinuous solutions , where `` @xmath8 '' refers to solutions outside the light cone , `` @xmath9 '' refers to solutions inside the light cone and @xmath10 .",
    "it has been already discussed in @xcite that the velocity @xmath0 is distinguished by the model and it is the unique admissible velocity for the propagation of field discontinuities .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath11 . for solutions outside the light cone",
    "our ansatz takes the form @xmath12 in the new variable @xmath13 , related to @xmath14 by the formula @xmath15 , the equation ( [ el ] ) takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17",
    ". it could be helpful to consider equation ( [ eqg ] ) as an equation of motion of a fictious particle in the potential @xmath18 .",
    "as we mentioned already in @xcite , equation ( [ eqg ] ) has partial solutions @xmath19 where @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are bessel functions .",
    "the partial solution not considered in @xcite is a constant zero solution .",
    "because of sign@xmath5 , @xmath25 is a solution of ( [ eqg ] ) .",
    "such a solution corresponds to the solution @xmath26 in a physical system , so it is well motivated from a physical point of view .",
    "the solution @xmath27 can be parametrized by only one parameter because at @xmath28 the bessel function @xmath24 has a singularity , so for physical reasons we set @xmath29 .",
    "the second coefficient @xmath30 can be expressed by the value of @xmath31 , which results in @xmath32 as was explained in a previous paper , depending on the values @xmath31 , the solution @xmath27 can be positive or can be matched with a negative partial solution @xmath33 .",
    "the intermediate case allows for matching the solution @xmath27 with the trivial solution @xmath25 . in this case",
    "@xmath27 reaches its zero value quadratically .",
    "this happens for @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the first zero of @xmath36 .",
    "we name this value @xmath37 .",
    "approximately @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the full compact impulse reads @xmath39     at moments @xmath40 for @xmath41.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    the matching point @xmath42 moves with subluminal velocity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath45 it is reached by the discontinuity @xmath46 .",
    "it comes from the fact that the length of the compact shock impulse @xmath47 for @xmath45 has a leading term @xmath48 .      as was discussed in @xcite , for @xmath49",
    ", negative partial solutions are present .",
    "if @xmath31 is not too big a full compact impulse @xmath50 is composed of two pieces @xmath27 and @xmath33 .",
    "again , for a certain value of @xmath31 a partial solution @xmath33 reaches its zero @xmath51 quadratically , therefore it could be matched with a constant zero partial solution . at the point",
    "@xmath52 @xmath33 is matched with @xmath27 .",
    "we have used a special notation @xmath53 for those zeros for which the field reaches its zero value in a quadratic way , whereas all other zeros we label by @xmath54 . a general higher - rank multi - zero solution consists of partial solutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 and has a matching points @xmath57 and @xmath53 .    as an example",
    "let us study in details a solution for @xmath58 .",
    "there are three partial solutions @xmath27 , @xmath33 and a constant solution @xmath25 , and two matching points @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "the partial solutions obey the following matching conditions @xmath59 the first condition , @xmath60 , and conditions ( [ zszycie2 ] ) give us @xmath61\\label{g_0},\\\\",
    "g_1(y)&=&-\\frac{1}{\\rho^2}\\left[1-\\frac{y_1(\\rho\\overline{c}_1)j_0(\\rho y)-j_1(\\rho\\overline{c}_1)y_0(\\rho y)}{y_1(\\rho\\overline{c}_1)j_0(\\rho \\overline{c}_1)-j_1(\\rho\\overline{c}_1)y_0(\\rho \\overline{c}_1)}\\right]\\label{g_1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath31 is expressed in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "the other conditions in ( [ zszycie1 ] ) give algebraic equations for @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "these equations can be rewritten in the following form @xmath62 equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "we will not present formulas for bigger @xmath63 because they are too complicated .    in figs.[multi3 ]",
    "-[multi4 ] we present two examples of multi - zero solutions @xmath50 with three and four segments , respectively . for higher - range solutions , @xmath64 , instead of solutions",
    "we present only plots of numerical values of @xmath31 and @xmath53 as functions of @xmath63 , see figs [ initial_kwadrat]-[zeros ] .",
    "the numerical results suggest , surprisingly , that , at least for not too large @xmath63 , both the sequence of @xmath65 and the sequence of zeros @xmath53 behave linearly ( arithmetic sequences ) .",
    "linear fits give us :    * @xmath66 @xmath67 * @xmath68 @xmath69 * @xmath70 @xmath71    ) multi - zero solution @xmath50 for @xmath41.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    ) multi - zero solution @xmath50 for @xmath41.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]     for consecutive multi - zero compact solutions @xmath50 .",
    "straight lines represent linear fits to numerical data .",
    "the upper line has been obtained for @xmath66 , the middle line for @xmath68 and the bottom line corresponds to @xmath70.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]     and their linear fits .",
    "the upper line has been obtained for @xmath66 , the middle line for @xmath68 and the bottom line corresponds to @xmath70.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this means that the size of a compact impulse ( as a function of @xmath13 ) or the size of an initial compacton configuration ( as a function of @xmath72 ) changes linearly with a number @xmath63 .",
    "the size of the compacton for a fixed @xmath63 shrinks when @xmath73 increases .",
    "we want to emphasize that linear dependence @xmath53 and @xmath31 is completely unexpected .",
    "the expressions for solutions for higher @xmath63 and relations between coefficients are very complicated and one can not expect such a simple relationship .",
    "we have presented a new class of solutions in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional signum - klein - gordon model which was not been considered in @xcite . the solutions which appear in models with v - shaped potentials are usually either shock or compacton type .",
    "our solutions merge both of these properties .",
    "the compact shock impulses , presented above , have on one end a wave front where a scalar field is discontinuous and on the other end they approach their vacuum value quadratically .",
