    "the precision test of the standard model ( sm ) at the lep gave a possibility not only to determine all the parameters and particle masses at the level of radiative corrections but also afforded an opportunity for searching for signals of new heavy particles beyond the energy scale of it . on the base of the lep2 experiments the low bounds on parameters of various models extending the sm have been estimated and the scale of new physics was obtained @xcite . although no new particles were discovered , a general believe is that the energy scale of new physics to be of order 1 tev , that may serve as a guide for experiments at the tevatron and lhc . in this situation ,",
    "any information about new heavy particles obtained on the base of the present day data is desirable and important .",
    "numerous extended models include the @xmath0 gauge boson  massive neutral vector particle associated with the extra @xmath1 subgroup of an underlying group .",
    "searching for this particle as a virtual state is widely discussed in the literature ( see for references @xcite ) . in the content of searching for @xmath0 at the lhc and the ilc an essential information and prospects for future investigations are given in lectures @xcite .",
    "such aspects as the mass of @xmath0 , couplings to the sm particles , @xmath2 mixing and its influence in various processes and particles parameters , distinctions between different models are discussed in details .",
    "we shall turn to these papers in what follows . as concerned a searching for @xmath0 in the lep experiments and the experiments at tevatron @xcite , it was carried out mainly in a model - dependent way .",
    "a wide class of popular models has been investigated and low bounds on the mass @xmath3 were estimated ( see , @xcite ) . as it is occurred , the low masses are varying in a wide energy interval 400 - 1800 gev dependently on a specific model .",
    "these bounds are a little bit different in the lep and tevatron experiments . in this situation",
    "a model - independent analysis is of interest .    in the papers @xcite of the present authors a new approach for the model - independent search for @xmath0-boson",
    "was proposed which , in contrast to other model - independent searches , gives a possibility to pick out uniquely this virtual state and determine its characteristics .",
    "the corresponding observables have also been introduced and applied to analyze the lep2 experiment data .",
    "our consideration is based on two constituents : 1 ) the relations between the effective low - energy couplings derived from the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for fermion scattering amplitudes .",
    "we called them the rg relations . due to these relations , a number of unknown @xmath0 parameters entering the amplitudes of different scattering processes considerably decreases .",
    "2 ) when these relations are accounted for , some kinematics properties of the amplitude become uniquely correlated with this virtual state and the @xmath0 signals exhibit themselves .",
    "the rg relations allow to introduce observables correlated uniquely with the @xmath0-boson . comparing the mean values of the observables with the necessary specific values , one could arrive at a conclusion about the @xmath0 existence .",
    "the confidence level ( cl ) of these values has been estimated and adduced in addition . without taking into consideration the rg relations the determination of @xmath0-boson",
    "requires a supplementary specification due to a larger number of different couplings contributing to the observables .",
    "similar situation takes place in the `` helicity model fits '' of lep collaborations @xcite when different virtual states contribute to each of the specific models ( aa , vv , and so on ) . therefore these fits had the goal to discover any signals of new physics independently of the particular states which may cause deviations from the sm .",
    "note that the lep collaborations saw no indications of new contact four fermion interactions in these fits .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the one - parametric observables were introduced and the signals ( hints in fact ) of the @xmath0 have been determined at the 1@xmath4 cl in the @xmath5 process , and at the 2@xmath4 cl in the bhabha process . the @xmath0 mass was estimated to be 11.2 tev . an increase in statistics",
    "could make these signals more pronounced and there is a good chance to discover this particle at the lhc .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the updated results of the one - parameter fit and the complete many - parametric fit of the lep2 data were performed with the goal to estimate a possible signal of the @xmath0-boson with accounting for the final data of the lep collaborations delphi and opal @xcite .",
    "usually , in a many - parametric fit the uncertainty of the result increases drastically because of extra parameters . on the contrary , in our approach due to the rg relations between the low - energy couplings there are only 2 - 3 independent parameters for the investigated leptonic scattering processes . as it was showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , an inevitable increase of confidence areas in the many - parametric space was compensated due to accounting for all accessible experimental information .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of the many - parametric fit was estimated as the comparable with previous one - parametric fits in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "the combined data fit for all lepton processes is also possible .    from the results obtained on the searching for abelian @xmath0 within the lep experiment data set",
    "we conclude that it is insufficient for convincing discovery of this particle as the virtual state .",
    "in this situation it is reasonable to analyze the data by using the neural network approach which is able to make a realistic prognoses for the parameters of interest .",
    "this investigation was done within the two parametric global fit of the lep2 data on the bhabha scattering process . as the result of all these considerations we derive at the 2@xmath4 cl the characteristics of the @xmath0 ( the vector @xmath6 and axial - vector @xmath7 couplings of the @xmath0 with sm leptons and the @xmath8 mixing ) .",
    "the @xmath0 mass is also estimated . due to the universality of the @xmath7 we also derived the model independent estimate of the @xmath0 axial - vector couplings to quarks , @xmath9 .",
    "note that the hints for the @xmath0 have been determined in all the processes considered that increases the reliability of the signal .",
    "these results may serve as a good input into the future lhc and ilc experiments and used in various aspects . to underline the importance of them we mention that there are many tools at the lhc for the identification of @xmath0 .",
    "but many of them are only applicable if @xmath0 is relatively light",
    ". the knowledge of the @xmath0 couplings to sm fermions also have important consequences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we give a necessary information about the description of @xmath0 at low energies . in sects .",
    "3 - 5 we discuss the origin of the rg relations , their explicit forms for the case of the heavy @xmath0 and consequences of the relations for scattering processes investigated . in sect .",
    "6 the cross sections and the observables to pick out uniquely the virtual @xmath0 in the @xmath10 processes are given .",
    "the fits of data are described and discussed . then in sect .",
    "7 the same is present for the bhabha process @xmath11 .",
    "the one parametric and two parametric fits are discussed . in sect .",
    "8 the analysis of this process is carried out by using the neuron network approach . the criteria for training",
    "the network are introduced which guarantee the 2@xmath4 cl deviations of the data from the model containing the sm with extra @xmath12 .",
    "the obtained parameters of the @xmath0 practically coincide with that of derived in the one parameter analysis . in this way",
    "we determine the characteristics of the @xmath0 coming from the lep experiments . in sect .",
    "9 we discuss the role of the present model - independent analysis for the lhc experiments . the discussion and comparison with results of other approaches are given in sect . 10 . in the appendix",
    "we describe the two - mass - scale yukawa model and analyze in detail how the decoupling of the loop contributions due to heavy virtual states is realized when the mixing of fields is taken into consideration .",
    "this point is an essential element of the approach developed .",
    "let us adduce a necessary information about the abelian @xmath0-boson .",
    "this particle is predicted by a number of grand unification models . among them the @xmath13 and @xmath14 based models @xcite",
    "( for instance , lr , @xmath15 and so on ) are often discussed in the literature . in all the models ,",
    "the abelian @xmath0-boson is described by a low - energy @xmath16 gauge subgroup originated in some symmetry breaking pattern .    at low energies ,",
    "the @xmath0-boson can manifest itself by means of the couplings to the sm fermions and scalars as a virtual intermediate state . moreover , the @xmath17-boson couplings are also modified due to a @xmath17@xmath0 mixing . in principle",
    ", arbitrary effective @xmath0 interactions to the sm fields could be considered at low energies . however , the couplings of non - renormalizable types have to be suppressed by heavy mass scales because of decoupling",
    ". therefore , significant signals beyond the sm can be inspired by the couplings of renormalizable types .",
    "such couplings can be derived by adding new @xmath16-terms to the electroweak covariant derivatives @xmath18 in the lagrangian @xcite ( review , @xcite ) @xmath19 where summation over all the sm left - handed fermion doublets , leptons and quarks , @xmath20 , and the right - handed singlets , @xmath21 , is understood .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the charge of @xmath23 in positron charge units , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for leptons and 1/3 for quarks .    for general purposes",
    "we derive the rg relations for the @xmath0 beyond the sm with two light higgs doublets ( thdm ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 interactions with the scalar doublets can be parametrized in a model - independent way as follows , @xmath26 in these formulas , @xmath27 are the charges associated with the @xmath28 and the @xmath0 gauge groups , respectively , @xmath29 are the pauli matrices , @xmath30 is the generator corresponding to the gauge group of the @xmath0 boson , and @xmath31 is the @xmath32 hypercharge .    the yukawa lagrangian can be written in the form @xmath33 \\right.\\nonumber\\\\&&\\left .",

    "the @xmath17@xmath0 mixing angle @xmath35 is determined by the coupling @xmath36 as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the sm weinberg angle , and @xmath39 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant . although the mixing angle is a small quantity of order @xmath40 , it contributes to the @xmath17-boson exchange amplitude and can not be neglected at the lep energies .    in what follows",
    "we will also use the @xmath0 couplings to the vector and axial - vector fermion currents defined as @xmath41 the lagrangian ( [ lf ] ) leads to the following interactions between the fermions and the @xmath17 and @xmath0 mass eigenstates : @xmath42f , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}_{z'\\bar{f}f}&=&\\frac{1}{2 } z'_\\mu\\bar{f}\\gamma^\\mu\\left [ ( v_f+\\gamma^5 a_f)\\cos\\theta_0 -\\right.\\nonumber\\\\&&\\quad\\left .",

    "low energy parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 must be fitted in experiments . in most investigations",
    "they were considered as independent ones . in a particular model ,",
    "the couplings @xmath50 , @xmath51 take some specific values . in case when the model is unknown , these parameters remain potentially arbitrary numbers . however , this is not the case if one assumes that the underlying extended model is a renormalizable one . in the papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that these parameters are correlated due to renormalizability .",
    "we called them the rg relations . since",
    "this notion is a key - point of our consideration , we discuss it in detail .",
    "what is rg relation ? generally speaking , this is a correlation between low energy parameters of interactions of a heavy new particle with known light particles of the sm following from the requirement that full unknown yet theory extending sm is to be renormalizable .",
    "strictly speaking , rg relations are the consequence of two constituencies :    1 .",
    "rg equation for a scattering amplitude ; 2 .   decoupling theorem .",
    "the latter one describes the modification of both the rg operator @xmath52 and an amplitude at the energy threshold @xmath53 of new physics . here ,",
    "@xmath54- and @xmath55-functions correspond to all the charges @xmath56 and fields and masses @xmath57 of the underlying theory .",
    "the rg equation for a scattering amplitude @xmath23 reads , @xmath58 where @xmath23 accounts for as intermediate states either the light or heavy virtual particles of the full theory .",
    "the standard usage of the rg equation is to improve the amplitude by solving this equation for the operator @xmath59 calculated in a given order of perturbation theory .",
    "however , to search for heavy virtual particles , we will use eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) in another way .",
    "first we note that for any renormalizable theory , the rg equation is just identity , if @xmath23 and @xmath59 are calculated in a given order of loop expansion . in this case",
    "( [ rge ] ) expresses the well known fact that the structure of the divergent term coincides with the structure of the corresponding term in a tree - level lagrangian .",
    "for example , in massless qed , the tree - level plus one - loop one - particle - irreducible vertex function describing scattering of electron in an external electromagnetic field @xmath60 , @xmath61 , is        if we calculate the rg operator in one - loop order @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the beta - function and the anomalous dimensions of electromagnetic and electron fields , respectively , and apply it to @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath66 then , accounting for the values of @xmath67 and the factor @xmath68 in @xmath69 , we observe that the first and the last terms in the r.h.s . cancel . since @xmath70-dependent term in @xmath71 is @xmath72 , we see that eq.([rge1 ] ) is identity in the order @xmath73 .",
    "next important point is that in a theory with different mass scales the decoupling of heavy - loop contributions at the threshold of heavy masses , @xmath53 , results in the following property : the running of all functions is regulated by the loops of light particles . therefore , the @xmath74 and @xmath75 functions at low energies are determined by the sm particles , only .",
    "this fact is the consequence of the decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "the decoupling results in the redefinition of parameters at the scale @xmath53 and removing heavy - particle loop contributions from rg equation @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the parameters of the sm .",
    "they are calculated assuming that no heavy particles are excited inside loops .",
    "the matching between both sets of parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 is chosen at the normalization point @xmath79 , @xmath80    the differential operator @xmath81 in the rg equation is in fact unique ; the apparently different @xmath81 in both theories are the same !    note that if a theory with different mass scales is specified one can freely replace the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 by each other @xcite .",
    "an example of the derivation and the main features of the rg relations are shown in the appendix for a simple model with different mass scales .    if underlying theory is not specified , the set of @xmath56 , @xmath57 is unknown .",
    "the low energy theory consists of the sm plus the effective lagrangian generated by the interactions of light particles with virtual heavy particle states .",
    "the low energy parameters @xmath82 of these interactions are arbitrary numbers which must be constrained by experiments . by calculating the rg operator @xmath81 and the scattering amplitudes of light particles in this ` external field ' in a chosen order of loop expansion",
    ", it is possible to obtain the model - independent correlations between @xmath82 .",
    "these are just the re relations .",
    "let us derive the correlations between @xmath50 , @xmath83 appearing due to renormalizability of the underlying theory containing @xmath0 .    in our case",
    ", the rg invariance of the vertex leads to the equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are computed with taking into account the loops of light particles .",
    "now we derive the rg relations following from the one - loop consideration . in accordance with the previous sections ,",
    "the one - loop rg equation for the vertex function reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the tree - level and one - loop contributions to the fermion-@xmath0 vertex .",
    "@xmath90 is the one - loop level part of the rg operator .",
    "vertex at the one - loop level . ]        to calculate these functions , only the divergent parts of the one - loop vertices are to be calculated .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ f-2 ] . the fermion anomalous dimensions @xmath91 can be calculated by using the diagrams in fig . [ f-3 ] .",
    "then , eq.([rgez ] ) leads to algebraic equations for the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath92 and @xmath49 which have two sets of solutions @xcite : @xmath93 and @xmath94 here @xmath23 and @xmath95 are the partners of the @xmath96 fermion doublet ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) , @xmath99 is the third component of weak isospin .",
    "the first of these relations describes the @xmath0 boson analogous to the third component of the @xmath96 gauge field .",
    "the couplings to the right - handed singlet are absent .",
    "the second relation corresponds to the abelian @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the sm lagrangian appears to be invariant with respect to the @xmath16 group associated with the @xmath0 .",
    "the last relation in eq.([rgr2 ] ) ensures the @xmath100 eq.([lyukawa ] ) is to be invariant with respect to the @xmath16 transformations .",
    "introducing the @xmath0 couplings to the vector and axial - vector fermion currents ( [ av ] ) , the last line in eq . ( [ rgr2 ] ) yields @xmath101 the couplings of the abelian @xmath0 to the axial - vector fermion current have a universal absolute value proportional to the @xmath0 coupling to the scalar doublet .",
    "these relations are model independent .",
    "in particular , they hold in all the known models containing the abelian @xmath0 .",
    "the most discussed models are derived from the @xmath102 group ( the so called lr , @xmath103-@xmath104 models ) .",

    "the combined value also shows no signal at the 1@xmath4 cl . from the combined fit",
    "the 95% cl bound on the value of @xmath107 can be derived , @xmath109 .",
    "supposing the @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath110 to be of the order of the electroweak one , @xmath111 , the corresponding @xmath0 mass has to be larger than @xmath112 tev .      a complete two parametric fit of experimental data based directly on the differential cross - sections has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to",
    "only two independent couplings this fit is efficient . in the fitting the available final data for the differential cross - sections of the bhabha process were used .",
    "the data set consists of 299 bins including the data of aleph at 130 - 183 gev , delphi at 189 - 207 gev , l3 at 183 - 189 gev , and opal at 130 - 207 gev @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure is similar to that of discussed above for the abelian @xmath0 .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the parameter space of the chiral @xmath0 is the plane ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) .",
    "the minimum of the @xmath106-function , @xmath115 , is reached at zero value of @xmath113 ( @xmath116 ) and almost independent of the value of @xmath114 ( the maximal - likelihood values of the couplings ) . the 95% cl area ( @xmath117 )",
    "is shown in figure 3 .",
    "[ fig - ch - many ]    as one can see , the zero point , @xmath118 ( the absence of the chiral @xmath0 boson ) is inside the confidence area .",
    "the value of @xmath106 in this point ( 238.62 ) is indistinguishable from the @xmath119 . in other words ,",
    "the set of experimental data can not determine the signal of the chiral @xmath0-boson .",
    "as also is seen , the value of @xmath113 is constrained as @xmath120 at the 95% cl .",
    "this upper bound is in an agreement with the corresponding result of the one - parameter fit ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 mass has to be larger than @xmath122 tev , if the @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath110 is again supposed to be of the order of the electroweak one , @xmath111 .",
    "the fit of the differential cross - sections leads to a better accuracy for @xmath113 than the fit of the integrated cross - sections based on the same data . without accounting for the model - independent relations between the @xmath0 couplings it is impossible to obtain such results",
    "in this section we discuss all the assumptions giving a possibility to pick out the @xmath0 signal and determine its characteristics in a model independent way .",
    "we also note the role of the present results for the future lhc and ilc experiments . as it was already stressed , in searching for this particle at the lep and tevatron a model dependent analysis was mainly used .",
    "the motivation for this was the different number of chiral fermions involved in different models ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the low bounds on @xmath3 have been estimated and a smallness of the @xmath2 mixing was also observed .",
    "on the contrary , in our model independent approach the rg relations between the parameters of the effective low energy lagrangians have been accounted for that gave a possibility to determine not only the bounds but also the mass and other parameters of the @xmath0 .",
    "first we note all the assumptions used in our considerations .",
    "we analyzed the four - fermion scattering amplitudes of order @xmath123 generated by the @xmath0 virtual states .",
    "the vertices linear in @xmath0 were included into the effective low - energy lagrangian .",
    "we also impose a number of natural conditions .",
    "the interactions of a renormalizable type are dominant at low energies @xmath124 .",
    "the non - renormalizable interactions generated at high energies due to radiation corrections are suppressed by the inverse heavy mass @xmath125 and neglected .",
    "we also assumed that the @xmath126 gauge group of the sm is a subgroup of the gut group .",
    "as a consequence , all structure constants connecting two sm gauge bosons with @xmath0 are to be zero .",
    "hence , the interactions of gauge fields of the types @xmath127 , and other are absent at the tree level .",
    "our effective lagrangian is also consistent with the absence of the tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) in the fermion sector .",
    "the renormalizable interactions of fermions and scalars are described by the yukawa lagrangian ( [ lyukawa ] ) that accounts for different possibilities of the yukawa sector without the tree - level fcncs .",
    "these assumptions are quite general and satisfied in a wide class of @xmath13 inspired models .    within these constraints for the low energy effective lagrangian the rg correlations have been derived . correspondingly , the model independent estimates of the mass @xmath3 and other parameters are regulated by the noted requirements .",
    "therefore , the extended underlying model has also to accept them .    in this regard ,",
    "let us discuss the role of the obtained estimates for the lhc .",
    "as it is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) , there are many tools at the lhc for @xmath0 identification .",
    "but many of them are only applicable if this particle is relatively light .",
    "our results are in favor to this case .",
    "next important point is the determination of @xmath0 couplings to the various sm fermions",
    ". as we have shown , the axial - vector couplings of the @xmath0 to the sm fermions are universal and proportional to its coupling to the higgs field .",
    "hence we have obtained an estimate of the @xmath128 couplings for both leptons and quarks .",
    "this is an essential input because experimental analyses for the lhc have mainly concentrated on being able to distinguish models and not on actual couplings .",
    "the vector coupling @xmath129 was also estimated that , in particular , may help to distinguish the decay of the @xmath0 resonance state to @xmath130 pairs .",
    "since the couplings @xmath131 and @xmath129 were estimated there is a possibility to distinguish this process from the decay of the @xmath132 system . in the literature @xcite on searching for the @xmath0",
    "it is also mentioned that the determination of the @xmath0 couplings to fermions could be fulfilled channel by channel , @xmath133 ,  . in almost all these considerations the relations between the parameters have not been taken into account . but this is very essential for treating of experimental data and introducing relevant observables to measure .    other parameter is the @xmath2 mixing , which is responsible for different decay processes and the effective interaction vertices generated at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it is also determined by the axial - vector coupling ( see eq .",
    "( [ grgav ] ) ) and estimated in a model independent way .",
    "remind that in our analysis ( in contrast to the approaches of the lep collaborations ) the mixing was systematically taken into account .",
    "its value is of the same order of magnitude as the parameters that were fitted in experiments .",
    "note also that the existence of other heavy particles with masses @xmath134 does not influence the rg relations which are the consequences of the necessary condition for renormalizability .",
    "in fact , this condition ( the structure of a divergence generated by radiation corrections coincides with that of the tree - level vertex ) holds for each renormalizable type interaction .",
    "an important role of the model independent results for searching for @xmath0 at the lhc and ilc consists , in particular , in possibility to determine the particle as a virtual state due to a large amount of relevant events .",
    "we mentioned already that , in principle , lep experiments were able to determine it if the statistics was sufficiently large .",
    "experiments at the ilc will increase numerously the data set of interest .",
    "in fact , the observables , introduced in sects . 6 and 7 for picking out uniquely @xmath135 and @xmath136 couplings in the leptonic scattering process , are also effective at energies @xmath137 gev and could be applied in future experiments at ilc .",
    "other model independent methods of searching for the @xmath0 as a resonance state are proposed in the literature ( see refs .",
    "we do not discuss them here because they take no relations between the parameters into consideration .",
    "besides , the main goal of the present paper is to adduce model independent information about the @xmath0 followed from experiments at low energies .",
    "different aspects of @xmath0 physics at the lhc are out of the scope of it .",
    "in this section we collect in a convenient form all the results obtained and make a comparison with other investigations on searching for @xmath0 at low energies .",
    "in fact , this is a large area to discuss .",
    "references to numerous results obtained in either model dependent or model independent approaches can be found in the surveys @xcite .",
    "further subdivision can be done into the considerations accounting for any type correlations between the parameters of the low energy effective interactions and that of assuming complete independence of them .",
    "because of a large amount of fitting parameters the latter are less predictable .",

    "the important property is that the @xmath229-term in the divergent part reproduces the logarithm of the cut - off scale .",
    "so , such a potentially large term has to be automatically absorbed by the renormalization at low energies and leads to no observable effects .",
    "however , if the renormalization is actually performed at high energies ( as in the @xmath207 renormalization scheme ) the potentially large @xmath229-terms should be re - summed manually by the redefinition of the physical couplings and masses at the scale @xmath53 .",

    "but this is an important step in deriving the rg relation for el parameters .",
    "fortunately , there is a simple procedure allowing to avoid the mixing in eq .",

    "( [ app23 ] ) is just the rg identity for the scattering amplitude calculated in the absence of the heavy particles .",
