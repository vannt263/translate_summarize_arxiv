    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in principle permits the existence of hadrons containing both quarks and valence gluons .",
    "these are commonly known as hybrids . for example , in the meson sector , the presence of explicit glue allows for states with quantum numbers @xmath0 .",
    "the standard quark model can not describe a meson with the above quantum numbers .",
    "hadrons with this feature are called exotic .",
    "other exotic states are possible @xcite , however , in this article we will solely consider the @xmath3 hybrid exotic meson .    according to @xcite",
    "experimentally established @xmath3 mesons are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "several experimental programs currently focus on studies of exotic hadrons in general .    on the theoretical side",
    "we expect the lattice formulation of qcd , being a first - principles approach , to eventually yield the properties of hybrid exotics such as masses and decay widths .",
    "studies in this area have been but a few @xcite .",
    "results hint at masses in the 1.4  gev region @xcite , and also at a state close to 1.9  gev @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we examine the mass spectrum of @xmath3 mesons based on lattice qcd .",
    "we utilize the outcome of a numerical simulation , gauge field configurations and quark propagators , which had been previously generated to study hybrid exotic decay widths @xcite .",
    "the novel feature here is the use of bayesian analysis , more precisely the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis tool enables us to utilize the entire range of lattice time slices , thus eliminating the necessity for a subjective choice of a time interval defining a plateau in the effective mass function , an approach almost universally used as an analysis method to extract hadron masses .",
    "when all time slices are utilized , on a given lattice volume , the method delivers unambiguous results , free from subjective choices of effective mass plateaus .",
    "in addition , the mem is quite naturally adapted to multiple states , if present .",
    "we will particularly rely on this feature to uncover the @xmath3 hybrid exotic meson mass spectrum , up to somewhat above 2  gev .",
    "in the context of the decay width calculation @xcite it was argued that systematic errors would likely dominate the final result .",
    "for this reason the lattice action and lattice sizes were selected to keep the numerical effort moderate .",
    "although such a constraint would not seem to be necessary for our present aim of ` just ' extracting spectral masses , we find that the lattices and quark propagators generated in @xcite give surprisingly relevant results .",
    "thus , we here present the @xmath3 exotic hybrid mass spectrum based on the wilson gauge field action used with wilson fermions , in the quenched approximation , on an anisotropic lattice of size @xmath6 .",
    "the bare aspect ratio is @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the spatial and @xmath9 the temporal lattice constants .",
    "simulations were done at one value of a global gauge coupling @xmath10 and four values of global hopping parameters @xmath11 , as they appear in tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] below .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a precise definition of these global parameters .    in order to set the physical mass scale , standard local zero - momentum meson operators of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is color , were employed for the pseudoscalar meson @xmath14 , the vector meson @xmath15 , and the @xmath16 meson @xmath17 . where @xmath18 are spatial directions .    for an operator coupling to @xmath3 hybrid meson states , which we collectively refer to with @xmath19 ,",
    "we follow @xcite and use @xmath20\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath21 denote color indices and @xmath22 is a product of @xmath23 link matrices arranged in a clover pattern @xmath24 which is used in the spatial planes only thus employing magnetic type gluons , in the rest frame .",
    "the parity transformation @xmath25 applied to ( [ hyopert ] ) gives @xmath26 , as it should .",
    "this relation relies on @xmath27 for @xmath18 , using the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite . at the quantum level the corresponding propagator respects exact ( negative ) parity because the ( quenched ) gauge field action @xmath28 $ ] is translationally invariant , and satisfies @xmath29 { \\cal p}^{-1 } = s[u]$ ] .",
    "however , in a numerical simulation those two properties are achieved only in the limit of a large number of gauge field configurations , but are otherwise approximate .",
    "consequently , one should expect that the hybrid meson propagator is contaminated by states of the wrong ( positive ) parity , albeit with a small amplitude .",
    "we will revisit this point in the discussion of results .",
    "with regard to charge conjugation @xmath30 we encounter a similar situation . for the purpose of discussion , changing @xmath19 to a charge neutral operator @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , the proof of @xmath33 relies on @xmath34 , which comes from @xmath35 .",
    "again , at the quantum level the corresponding propagator respects exact ( positive ) charge conjugation because of @xmath28=s[u^\\ast]$ ] .",
    "in contrast to the parity case this relation is easily enforced in the simulation .",
    "the configurations @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] are equally probable .",
    "thus with each @xmath36 $ ] in the ensemble of 200 configurations we also include @xmath37 $ ] and compute fermion propagators for both of those .",
    "this strategy doubles the number of fermion propagators that need to be computed to 400 .",
    "however , charge conjugation is now numerically exact , and this also appears to be the reason for an observed noise reduction of simulation signals .",
    "all meson operators @xmath38 , @xmath39 , are expanded by employing quark field smearing @xcite and gauge field fuzzing @xcite .",
    "smeared quark fields are constructed by spreading the original field @xmath40 over neighboring sites using a recursive procedure .",
    "define @xmath41 , then @xmath42 and similarly for @xmath43 , with @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is a strength factor which controls the amount of the smearing in spatial direction @xmath46 . to keep the magnitude of the resulting correlation functions numerically under control it is useful to apply a rescaling factor after each smearing step .",
    "a suitable choice is motivated by the following observation : for the sake of this argument only , interpret @xmath47 as hilbert space operators obeying standard anti - commutation relations , then we find @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the color - spin unit matrix .",
    "thus , with @xmath50 the smeared quark fields are rescaled as @xmath51 after each iteration step ( [ psi1 ] ) .",
    "similarly gauge field fuzzing is implemented defining @xmath52 , and then adding a sum over staples @xmath53\\,,\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with fuzzing strengths @xmath54 in directions @xmath55 .",
    "again , for numerical reasons , it is useful to rescale the fuzzy link variables .",
    "these are no longer elements of su(3 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath56 which suggests the normalization prescription @xmath57 enforcing a trace of one after each fuzzing step ( [ iteru ] ) .",
    "both normalization prescriptions are clearly invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "we use common strength parameters @xmath58 for all spatial directions .",
    "the basis of the current simulation are meson operators @xmath59 built from ( [ mesonops ] ) and ( [ hyopert ] ) where @xmath44 indicates that the quark and gauge fields have been replaced with smeared and fuzzed fields ( [ psi1 ] ) and ( [ iteru ] ) , respectively , at a common level @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding , single meson , correlation functions @xmath61 are the elements of a @xmath62 matrix .",
    "we use @xmath63 , and unsmeared fields ( @xmath64 ) are ignored . the same operators are used at both source and sink , so @xmath65 is hermitian . due to our choice of flavor structure ( [ hyopert ] ) , the separable terms in ( [ corx ] ) are zero .",
    "the time evolution of the eigenvalues of @xmath65 determines the mass spectrum for the meson @xmath66 . toward extracting the latter a standard procedure would be to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is fixed",
    ", @xmath69 is a @xmath62 matrix , its columns being the generalized eigenvectors , and @xmath70 is real diagonal .",
    "this approach is equivalent to a redefinition ( linear combination ) of the operators that make up the correlator matrix .",
    "its purpose is to improve the numerical ` quality ' of effective mass function plateaus derived from the eigenvalues .",
    "we shall not rely on effective mass functions here , but rather analyze correlator eigenvalues by means of the maximum entropy method . within this framework , solving of the generalized eigenvalue problem ( [ eigen ] ) offers no advantage from a numerical point of view .",
    "thus we will diagonalize @xmath65 directly .",
    "many eigenvalues , behaving exponentially with @xmath71 , rapidly vanish into numerical noise .",
    "conventional diagonalization methods do not work well under those circumstances .",
    "singular value decomposition ( svd ) , on the other hand , is ideally suited to the task @xcite .",
    "the svd reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are unitary in our case  , and @xmath75 contains the singular values satisfying @xmath76 .",
    "the relation of the singular values @xmath77 to the eigenvalues @xmath78 of @xmath65 is given by the following theorem : if @xmath65 is non - degenerate and positive semi - definite then the set of eigenvalues @xmath79 and singular values @xmath80 are the same .",
    "proving this is a simple exercise in linear algebra , the columns of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are eigenvectors which may differ by phase factors only . in case of a degeneracy , which is highly improbable in a numerical setting , the usual ambiguities with respect to eigenvectors",
    "apply . for simplicity",
    "we will refer to @xmath77 as eigenvalues .",
    "as an example , in fig .",

    "open plot symbols indicate data points not included in the analysis.,width=302 ]    bayesian analysis methods have been considered for lattice qcd @xcite , but are not widely used despite obvious advantages . for instance , one may maximize the time slice fitting range .",
    "the time slices used for all correlation functions in this work appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfx ] as filled plot symbols .",
    "the bayesian fitting problem can be set up and solved in a variety of ways .",
    "we here adopt the framework described in detail in ref .",
    ". a brief summary will be useful : the lattice provides correlation function data , say @xmath83 , denoting any set @xmath77 on the given time slice range @xmath84 .",
    "our data should be well described by the model @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 is a spectral density function . from the bayesian perspective",
    "the numbers @xmath87 are interpreted as stochastic variables . for these , employing bayes theorem , a conditional probability distribution function @xmath88 $ ] is constructed . aside from inessential normalization",
    "it has the form @xmath89\\propto{p}[\\sigma\\leftarrow\\rho]{p}[\\rho]\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath90 $ ] is known as the likelihood function .",
    "we construct it from the @xmath91-distance between the data and the model @xmath92 with @xmath93 being elements of the covariance matrix .",

    "bayesian inference uses information one might have about data , for example , a physical upper limit on the spectral masses .",
    "information like this is contained in @xmath94 $ ] , known as the bayesian prior .",
    "if no prior information is available , except say a physical mass range , a suitable choice is based on the shannon - jaynes entropy @xcite @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the mentioned cutoff , and the function @xmath97 is called the default model .",
    "it provides a reference point for the spectral density in the sense that @xmath98 , with @xmath99 if @xmath100",

    "for details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "we here only mention that the resulting spectral density @xmath87 is extremely insensitive to both the default model @xmath97 as well as to the entropy strength parameter @xmath101 .",
    "the numerical implementation of the above scheme requires discretization of the @xmath109 integrals in ( [ fmodel ] ) and ( [ smem ] ) .",
