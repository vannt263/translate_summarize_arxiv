    "trapping and manipulating ultracold atoms in an array of potentials created a turning point in the field of quantum fluids @xcite and their application for quantum information processing @xcite . implementing a mott insulator of strongly interacting bosons in an optical lattice laid the foundations to study and simulate many strongly correlated quantum many - body phases @xcite , with a big impact on condensed matter physics @xcite . nowadays many types of tunable quantum many - body systems are implemented to the study of central condensed matter phenomena , as quantum phase transitions , superfluidity and quantum magnetisms .",
    "counter propagating laser beams produce a designable optical lattices where atoms can hop among nearest sites with tunable on - site interactions , where in controlling the laser intensity the system casts from the superfluid into the mott insulator phase @xcite .",
    "this quantum phase transition is predicted by the bose - hubbard model and realized experimentally @xcite , where in the mott insulator the ultracold atoms are perfectly arranged on the lattice with fixed number of atoms per site .    in any practical setup , however , the formation process of a mott insulator is accompanied by the appearance of defects @xcite .",
    "for example , a non ideal mott insulator of filling factor one , namely of single atom per site , contains many vacancies that distributed randomly on the lattice .",
    "such vacancies are unavoidable and must be taken into account in any quantitatively precise treatment of the mott insulator .",
    "the vacancies are mobile and hop from site to site with the same parameter as the atom hopping parameter among nearest neighbor lattice sites . for experiments concerned with electronic excitations and optical processes in optical lattices , the light - matter coupling and electrostatic interaction parameters are usually much larger than the atom hopping parameter , and hence the vacancies can taken to be frozen on the lattice .    a different approach to form one dimensional optical lattices has been opened in the last years which rests on optical fibers @xcite . for",

    "the guided modes of ultrathin optical fibers , with diameters smaller than the wavelength of the guided light , exhibit strong transverse confinement and pronounced evanescent field .",
    "interference of two color evanescent fields surrounding an optical nanofiber give rise to an array of optical microtraps .",
    "the system was realized recently for cesium atoms interacting with a multicolor evanescent field surrounding an optical nanofiber , where the atoms are localized in a one dimensional lattice parallel to the nanofiber @xcite . due to the small trapping volumes",
    "the occupancy of each site is at most one and the filling factor is half .    in another approach",
    "the high degree of control of experimental parameters in optical lattices has been demonstrated to be implemented to the level of a single atom at a specific lattice site , the fact that should revolutionized the field of optical lattice ultracold atoms and its application to condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the flip of a spin ( change of the internal hyperfine state ) of individual atoms of certain lattice sites in the mott insulator phase can performed in a controlled way by the help of a tightly focused laser beam .",

    "the similarity between optical lattice ultracold atoms in the mott insulator phase and molecular crystals encourages us to introduce collective electronic excitations into such a system @xcite .",

    "an electronic excitation can be represented as a wave that propagates in the lattice , which is a quasi - particle termed an exciton @xcite .",
    "we extensively studied excitons in one and two dimensional optical lattices @xcite , and we examined their life times and emission patterns into free space @xcite , where we found that excitons can be metastable or superradiant .",
    "so far we treated large one and two dimensional optical lattices , where excitons behave as propagating plane waves .",

    "the atoms are considered to be two - level systems with electronic transition energy of @xmath2 .",
    "an electronic excitation can delocalize in the lattice due to resonance dipole - dipole interactions , namely an electronic excitation can transfer among the lattice sites @xcite .",

    ".    the damping rate for a bright collective electronic excitation of mode @xmath23 is obtained from the fermi golden rule , which is similar to an excited atom damping rate but in replacing the excited atom transition dipole @xmath31 with the collective transition dipole @xmath32 , which hold when the size of the chain is smaller than the wave length of the atomic transition .",
    "we have @xmath33 where the lattice length is @xmath34 . the first mode @xmath35 without nodes ,",
    "is found to be _ superradiant _ , with damping rate nine times larger than the second bright mode @xmath36 .",

    "in the formation of one dimensional optical lattices with one atom per site many vacancies appear in the lattice .",
    "lets assume that the vacancies are randomly distributed , such that in a long optical lattice we get many lattice segments of one , two , three , etc ... atoms , as plotted in figure ( 7 ) .",
    "we assume that the vacancies are localized where we neglect their hopping in the lattice . as we treat here electronic excitations in optical lattices where their hopping is much faster than the atom hopping we can consider the vacancies as frozen on the lattice .",
    "first , we treat each segment separately where we use the previous results concerning the formation of collective electronic excitations and their collective transition dipoles , damping rates and emission patterns .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we assume the lattice segments to be distributed in such a way that no two segment with the same number of sites are neighbors .",
    "therefore we can neglect the hopping of a collective electronic excitations among different lattice segments as they are off resonance .",

    "the collective electronic excitation are excited initially , e.g. , by a scattering of photons .",
